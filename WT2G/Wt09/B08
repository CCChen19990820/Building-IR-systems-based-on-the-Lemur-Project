<P>Following the controversy over President Clinton's public pressure on U.S. District Judge Harold Baer, Chief Justice of the United States William Rehnquist delivered a speech at American University in Washington, D.C. on the importance of an independent judiciary. Here is the text of that April 9, 1996 speech.</P>

<P>Washington College of Law Centennial Celebration<BR>
Plenary Academic Panel: The Future of the Federal Courts</P>

<P>American University<BR>
April 9, 1996</P></B>

<P>It is a great pleasure to be here this evening and participate in American University Washington College of Law's celebration of its centennial. And since the federal judiciary celebrated its bicentennial only a few years ago, this is an appropriate occasion to speak about the future of the federal courts. But it will be helpful, in trying to forecast the future of the federal courts, to look briefly at how they have evolved over the more than two hundred years they have been in existence.</P>

<P>The federal court system in the United States got off to a remarkably slow start two hundred years ago. The Supreme Court ruled quite early in the game that there were no common law crimes in the federal courts, and therefore no criminal prosecutions could be had unless authorized by an act of Congress criminalizing certain conduct. The federal trial courts had no "federal question" jurisdiction until 1875; this meant that if an individual wished to bring a lawsuit claiming that a right secured him by the federal constitution had been violated, that lawsuit had to be brought in state court. The Supreme Court of the United States could review a decision by the highest court of a state which decided a federal question, but the lower federal courts were not involved. Thus for nearly the first century of their existence, the staple of the business of the lower federal courts was admiralty cases and cases in which jurisdiction was based on diversity of citizenship.</P>

<P>But this distribution of business between the state court systems and the federal courts changed quite dramatically after the Civil War. In the aftermath of the conflict, the so-called Civil War amendments to the Constitution were adopted, and of those the Fourteenth Amendment has been a prolific source of judicial business. In 1875 federal district courts were given federal question jurisdiction, so that from then on cases involving constitutional claims could be initiated in the federal courts. Finally, the public view of the appropriate role for the federal government changed after the Civil War - - although the change moved in fits and starts at first, it inexorably moved in the direction of greater federal regulation of the citizenry. Until well after the Civil War, the general view was that the federal government should provide for the common defense, coin money, carry the mails, and pay for itself by collecting customs duties. But the increasing pace of the Industrial Revolution, the rapid spread of the railroad into every nook and cranny of the nation, the increasing size of manufacturing enterprises all provoked calls for regulation of what was increasingly a commerce which paid scant attention to state borders.</P>

<P>Before the turn of the twentieth century, Congress had passed the Interstate Commerce Act, giving a federal commission some control over railroad rates and practices, and the Sherman Anti- Trust Act, forbidding conspiracies in restraint of trade. As we moved into the twentieth century, the coming of the automobile and the airplane continued the transportation revolution. The pace of increase in federal regulation continued, driven partly by the interstate nature of so much of the country's business, and partly by a number of reform movements seeking to ameliorate the plight of those who did not share in the generally rising tide of prosperity. The typical pattern was for reform movements to originate in the states, only to discover that the practices which they sought to prohibit or limit could not be prohibited or limited to their satisfaction without the intervention of the federal government.</P>

<P>First came concern about wages and hours worked in factories, and child labor there. States adopted maximum hour and minimum wage laws, and laws prohibiting child labor. But as often as not the manufacturing plants which would be effected by these laws would pick up and move to a state which did not have such laws. Congress, viewing this phenomenon with dismay, finally itself enacted federal prohibitions against child labor, and later a federal maximum hour and minimum wage law. This pattern has continued in various areas of the law. A wave of reform lead to the enactment by the states of "blue sky" laws in the first part of this century, regulating the business of issuing and selling stock, and punishing fraud. But these laws were deemed inadequate, and the federal government stepped in as a part of President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal to enact federal regulations in that field. In the 1950s, many states enacted fair employment practice laws and anti-discrimination laws governing public accommodations and the like. But some states chose not to enact such laws, and dissatisfied reformers went to Congress to nationalize this field of lawmaking. The result was the Civil Rights laws enacted in the 1960s.</P>

<P>The wave of federal regulatory statutes also brings with it related problems that give rise to legal disputes. In the first place, disputes arise as to whether an agency or commission that is empowered to issue regulations under a statute has exceeded its authority with respect to one or more particular regulations. Federal courts must decide these questions, as well as basic questions of statutory interpretation. Second, because of the Supremacy Clause in our Constitution, every time Congress enacts a new statute dealing with some phase of the economy it very likely supersedes some of the laws of the various states which previously governed that area. For example, in 1974 Congress enacted the modestly titled Employees Retirement Income Security Act, which had as its basic purpose the introduction of some federal supervision over employer plans to provide various health and retirement benefits to employees. In the twenty years in which that statute has been on the books, our Court has decided twenty-one cases involving the question of whether or not the federal law preempted a particular state law dealing with the same general subject matter. And that, of course, is only the tip of the iceberg; if the Supreme Court has decided that number of cases, the federal appeals courts will have decided fifteen or twenty times that number of cases dealing with preemption under this particular federal statute.</P>

<P>The result of this two hundred year evolution has been that although ninety-five percent of the judicial business in the United States is still transacted in state courts, there has been a remarkable increase in the business of the federal courts because of these changes which I have described. And the federal courts are now awash in the most recent of these changes, which is the federalization of more and more crimes which once were thought to be matters of exclusive concern to the states.</P>

<P>Forty some years ago when I began the practice of law in Arizona, there were not many federal criminal statutes on the books. There were some very esoteric crimes, but the staple of the criminal business of federal courts outside of the metropolitan areas was confined to prosecutions for transporting a stolen car in interstate commerce, using the mails for interstate communications to commit fraud, and a very few other similar crimes.</P>

<P>But that landscape has entirely changed in the last forty years. Congress, understandably concerned with the increasing traffic and drugs and the violence resulting from the use of guns, has legislated again and again to make what once were only state crimes federal offenses. The same sort of dissatisfaction with state treatment of the cases in this area of the law has obtained as obtained earlier with welfare legislation and civil rights laws. Congress has been of the opinion that even though these gun and drug crimes could be prosecuted under state law, the state penal systems were too lenient in paroling serious offenders after having served only a fraction of the time to which they were sentenced. So Congress has stepped in, prescribed very severe sentencing guidelines for federal crimes, and federalized countless crimes involving drugs and guns.</P>

<P>All of this means that in talking about the future of the federal courts, we must understand that Congress will probably continue to enact new legislation which provides new causes of action for litigants on the civil side of the docket, and new federal crimes to be prosecuted on the criminal side of the federal docket.</P>

<P>It is the federal district courts of appeals that are being hit hardest by this ever increasing wave of litigation. The Supreme Court's docket is actually down from what it was several years ago. With the district courts, it is largely a question of having enough judicial manpower to adjudicate the incoming cases. The same is true to a large extent of the courts of appeals, except that indefinite enlargement of the number of judges on the courts of appeals poses problems of collegiality, maintaining a coherent body of law in the circuit, and the like. The majority of federal judges, if the Judicial Conference of the United States accurately reflects their views, think that the federal judiciary should remain a limited and somewhat specialized system of administering justice. Possible alternatives to indefinite enlargement of the courts of appeals would be the creation of specialized appellate courts for a particular subject matter, or the limitation of the automatic right of appeal from district courts to the courts of appeals. We have on our panel tonight two distinguished judges of the courts of appeals, Judge Reinhardt and Judge Becker, and a distinguished district court judge, Judge Barker, who can discuss these aspects of the federal courts more knowledgeably than I can.</P>

<P>It would be a mistake to think that just because a certain kind of judicial business has always been conducted in a particular way in the past, it therefore ought to be conducted that way in the future. The federal courts, like other governmental institutions, must, where necessary, change with the changing times. A Long Range Planning Committee of the Judicial Conference, of which both Judges Becker and Barker were members, has recently peered into the future and come up with a number of recommendations for how the federal judiciary can cope with the changes which the future will assuredly bring. But all of the planning and discussion by judges as to the future of the federal judiciary has a somewhat tentative, conditional air about it: in this area we are not masters in our own houses and any major change will have to be approved by Congress.</P>

<P>I have said that the judiciary must change with the changing times. But there are a very few essentials that are vital to the functioning of the federal court system as we know it. Surely one of these essentials is the independence of the judges who sit on these courts.</P>

<P>Article III of the Constitution guarantees to federal judges the right to continue in office during good behavior, and prohibits the diminution of their compensation. But these two constitutional provisions did not settle every question about the independence of the judiciary. As a result, there have been several actions by Congress over the years which have fleshed out the constitutional provision in a manner akin to the development of an "unwritten constitution" in Great Britain.</P>

<P>Article I of the Constitution provides that civil officers -- including judges -- may be impeached by the House of Representatives for "high crimes and misdemeanors," and if convicted by the Senate may be thereupon removed from office. The term "high crimes and misdemeanors" was sufficiently amorphous to leave open the possibility that a federal judge could be removed from office, not only for conduct that was criminal, but for rulings from the bench that seemed flagrantly wrong.</P>

<P>An important episode early in our nation's history in effect resolved this question. This was the impeachment trail of Samuel Chase, then an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, in 1805. Chase had been appointed to the Supreme Court by George Washington in 1796, but in those days the Supreme Court docket was even lighter than it is today; Supreme Court justices spent most of their judicial time riding circuit trying lawsuits in tandem with the resident judge. Chase was a striking figure physically - - over six feet tall, with a ruddy complexion which earned him the sobriquet (behind his back, of course) of "Old Bacon Face."  He was able but imperious, and totally lacking in the patience necessary for a trial judge.</P>

<P>Two years after Thomas Jefferson took office as President, in 1803, Chase delivered a partisan charge to a grand jury in Baltimore. Jefferson, learning of this, wrote to his lieutenants in the House of Representatives suggesting that they do something about it. The House proceeded to impeach Chase on a number of counts. The first count was the charge to the Baltimore grand jury. Other counts were based on his conduct of the trial of John Fries for treason in Philadelphia in 1800, and still others were based on his conduct in the trial of James Callender in Richmond for violation of the Sedition Act in the same year. The trial before the Senate began in February, 1805, presided over by the Vice President, Aaron Burr. Burr himself was a fugitive from justice at the time, having killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel at Weehawken, New Jersey the preceding summer. Criminal indictments were out for him in both New Jersey and New York, which caused one wag to remark that whereas in most courts the criminal was arraigned before the judge, in this court the judge was arraigned before the criminal.</P>

<P>More than fifty witnesses testified before the Senate. The charges pertaining to the Fries trial did not amount to much -- at the most they showed him to be headstrong and somewhat domineering, a trait not unknown in other federal judges. The charges in connection with the Callender trial were a good deal more serious. Callender was charged under the Sedition Act with bringing President John Adams into disrepute, inasmuch as he called him a toady to British interests in a long and incredibly turgid book entitled "The Prospect Before Us."  The evidence showed that Chase had actually taken the book with him from Baltimore to Richmond in order to allow the grand jury to consider it, and that during the stagecoach trip from Baltimore to Richmond he referred to Callender as a "scoundrel" to another passenger.</P>

<P>On March 1, 1805, the Senate convened to vote on the articles of impeachment against Chase. At that time there were thirty-four senators, twenty-five of whom were Jeffersonian Republicans. If these senators voted a party line, there would be the necessary two-thirds majority to convict Chase and remove him from office. Happily, they broke ranks. On the articles based on the Fries trial, the vote was sixteen to convict, and eighteen to acquit. The vote on the articles relating to the Callender trial was eighteen to convict, and sixteen for acquittal. On the count based on the charge to the Baltimore grand jury, the House managers came closest to prevailing -- nineteen senators voted guilty, and fifteen voted not guilty. But even this number fell four votes short of the two-thirds majority required, and Chase was therefore acquitted on all of the counts against him.</P>

<P>This decision by the Senate was enormously important in securing the kind of judicial independence contemplated by Article III. Coming only two years after the seminal decision of the Court in Marbury v. Madison, it coupled with the authority of the federal courts to declare legislative acts unconstitutional the assurance to federal judges that their judicial acts -- their rulings from the bench -- would not be a basis for removal from office by impeachment and conviction. And that has been the guiding principle of the House of Representatives and the Senate from that day to this; federal judges have been impeached and convicted -- happily, only a very few -- but it has been for criminal conduct such as tax evasion, perjury, and the like.</P>

<P>This principle only goes so far. It obviously does not mean that federal judges should not be criticized for the decisions which they make; they are frequently so criticized by the media and by law reviews, and there is certainly no reason why other citizens should not engage in the same practice. And the doctrine of judicial independence does not mean that the country will be forever in sway to groups of non-elected judges. When vacancies occur through death or retirement on any of the federal courts, replacements are nominated by the President, who has been elected by the people of the entire nation, subject to confirmation by the Senate, whose members have been elected by the people of their respective states. Both the President and the Senate have felt free to take into consideration the likely judicial philosophy of any nominee to the federal courts. Thus there is indirect popular input into the selection of federal judges.</P>

<P>This principle is perhaps best illustrated by the experience of President Franklin Roosevelt with appointments to the Supreme Court. Dissatisfied with decisions of that court which invalidated some provisions of his New Deal program, he asked Congress to enact what soon became known as a "court-packing plan," which would allow him to replace any Justice over seventy who did not retire with an additional Justice, up to the number of fifteen. This rather bald effort to change the philosophy of the Court was rejected by the United States Senate in 1937. But although Roosevelt lost that battle, he eventually won the war by serving three full terms as President and appointing eight of the nine members of the Court. This simply shows that there is a wrong way and a right way to go about putting a popular imprint on the judiciary.</P>

<P>The framers of the United States Constitution came up with two quite original ideas -- the first was the idea of a chief executive who was not responsible to the legislature, as Chief Executives are under the parliamentary system. The second was the idea of an independent judiciary with the authority to declare laws passed by Congress unconstitutional. The first idea -- a President not responsible to Congress -- has not been widely copied by other nations in the western world when they have come to review their systems of government. But the second idea -- that of an independent judiciary with the authority to finally interpret a written constitution - - has caught on with many other nations, particularly since the end of the Second World War. It is one of the crown jewels of our system of government today.</P>

<P>Change is the law of life, and the judiciary will have to change to meet the challenges which will face it in the future. But the independence of the federal judiciary is essential to its proper functioning and must be retained.</P>

in four New York congressional districts.  We affirm.

WINTER, Circuit Judge, 
 
The instant appeal involves Judge Korman's order that the 
defendants place on the Republican presidential primary ballot in 
the 9th, 15th, 18th, and 24th New York congressional districts, the 
names of delegates committed to vote at the Republican National 
Convention for intervenor Forbes.  Judge Korman based this order 
on his conclusion that New York ballot access requirements place 
a substantial burden on certain candidates, that many of these 
requirements serve no legitimate state interest, and that, but for 
these onerous and unjustified requirements, the Forbes delegates 
would be on the ballot in the districts in question.  See e.g. Storer 
v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724 (1974).  Exclusion of the Forbes 
delegates therefore violated the First Amendment as incorporated 
by the Fourteenth.  Our prior opinion in this matter was expressly 
limited to the question of whether New York ballot access laws 
violated the Equal Protection Clause.  We now address the First 
Amendment issues.  We agree with the district court and affirm.  
 
Familiarity with an earlier opinion by the district court, 
Rockefeller v. Powers, 909 F. Supp. 863 (E.D.N.Y. 1995), with an 
opinion by this court vacating an injunction issued by the district 
court, Rockefeller v. Powers, No. 95-9189, 1995 WL 790831 (2d 
Cir. Dec. 21, 1995), and with the memorandum and order on 
appeal at this time, Rockefeller v. Powers, No. 95-CV-4478, slip 
op. (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 21, 1995), is assumed.  Because the New York 
presidential primary is scheduled for March 7, 1996, our decision 
will be rendered with considerably less elaboration than is found 
in a typical opinion.  
 
With regard to the question of the substantiality of the burden 
placed on candidates seeking access to the primary ballot, the 
district court found that candidates without the support of the state 
Republican leadership were substantially burdened by the 
combination of: (i) the requirement that a slate of delegates collect 
signatures in each district amounting to 5% or 1250 registered 
Republicans, whichever is less; (ii) the requirement that the 
collection of signatures must occur in a period of 37 days, during 
which there are several important holidays, inclement weather, 
school and family vacations, and short periods of daylight; (iii) a 
rule limiting a voter from signing petitions for more than one 
candidate, thus reducing the total pool available to those 
collecting signatures; (iv) a host of rules defining what is a valid 
signature, including rules as to the qualification of witnesses to 
signings and inclusion of the election or Assembly district 
numbers of signers; and (v) other highly technical requirements 
that concern the presentation of petitions containing the signatures 
to election officials. We agree that this combination of New York 
requirements severely hampers candidates in contacting a 
sufficient number of registered Republicans and in collecting, 
legally documenting, and validly presenting their signatures. 
Indeed, as the district court found, at least 140% of the requisite 
5%/1250 signatures usually must be collected to survive 
hypertechnical challenges and to succeed in getting a delegate 
slate on the ballot.  (The Powers affidavit suggests that signatures 
of 140% of the required number is too little.)  
 
With regard to justification for the substantial burdens on 
candidates, the district court noted that New York ballot access 
rules are far more burdensome than those adopted by virtually 
every other state.  Indeed, the 5%/1250 requirement is itself 
onerous in comparison with other states even without the very 
technical rules concerning the validation and presentation of the 
signatures that require as a practical matter the collection of at 
least 140% of the requisite number of signatures.  The court 
further found that the rules as to the qualification of witnesses to 
signing, listing of election or Assembly district numbers for 
signers, and other technical requirements serve no legitimate 
governmental purposes.  Moreover, it concluded that the state's 
acknowledged interest in seeing that candidates on the ballot have 
substantial public support does not justify the 5%/1250 rule.  
Indeed, New York provides an option to political parties 
providing for the collection of the least of 0.5% or 1000 signatures 
in each district as a fully permissible alternative scheme.  The 
district court noted that his alternative scheme by its very 
existence demonstrates that the 5%/1250 requirement is 
unnecessary to satisfy the New York's interest in seeing that no 
candidate be on the ballot without substantial public support. We 
agree with the district court.  
 
With regard to causation, the district court found that legitimate 
efforts were made by the Forbes slates of delegates to get on the 
ballot in the districts in question but that the burdensome and 
highly technical requirements described above stymied these 
efforts.  Nevertheless, the Forbes slates did collect in excess of 
0.5% of valid (even by New York's whimsical standards) 
signatures of Republican voters in each of the districts in question 
and thus would have qualified under the alternative scheme.  The 
district court therefore ordered inclusion of the Forbes slate on the 
ballot in each of the districts.  The district court's finding of 
causation in fact is not clearly erroneous, and its use of the 0.5% 
requirement in fashioning a remedy satisfies any interest of the 
state in limiting the ballot to candidates with substantial support in 
each district.  
 
We therefore affirm.  The mandate shall issue forthwith.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA

FIRST LIEUTENANT ANDREW HOLMES,

Plaintiff,

vs.

CALIFORNIA ARMY NATIONAL GUARD; MAJOR TANDY 
K. BOZEMAN, in his official capacity; GOVERNOR PETE 
WILSON, in his official capacity; UNITED STATES ARMY 
NATIONAL GUARD; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; and 
WILLIAM J. PERRY, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, in his 
official capacity,  

Defendants.

No. C 95-688 SBA

_ORDER_

_OVERVIEW_

Plaintiff, First Lieutenant Andrew Holmes ("plaintiff" or "Lt. 
Holmes") brings this action to challenge his discharge from the 
California Army National Guard ("CANG") and the United States 
Army National Guard ("USANG"). Lt. Holmes was expelled from 
service pursuant to the military's current policy governing 
homosexuals after plaintiff acknowledged his homosexuality to his 
commanding officer. Plaintiff has named two sets of defendants; 
the USANG, the United States of America, William J. Perry, and 
Secretary of Defense (collectively referred to as the "Federal 
defendants"), and the CANG, Major Tandy Bozeman, and 
Governor Pete Wilson (collectively referred to as the "California 
defendants"). His amended complaint alleges claims based on state 
and federal law. 

Presently before the Court are: (1) the California defendants' 
Motion to Dismiss First Amended Complaint Pursuant to Rules 
12(b)(6) and 12(e); (2) the Federal defendants' Motion to Dismiss 
or, in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment; (3) and plaintiff's 
Cross-motion for Summary Adjudication as to Federal Defendants 
and Motion for Summary Adjudication as to California 
Defendants. Having read the papers filed in connection with these 
motions and considered the arguments of counsel, the Court 
GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART each of the parties' 
motions. 

___BACKGROUND_

I. _Military Policy Regarding Gays_

The United States Military has a long history of precluding 
homosexuals from serving in this country's armed forces. It was 
not until 1981, however, that the Department of Defense 
formalized its policy with the implementation of revised DOD 
Directive 1332.14 (1981) which mandated the discharge of all 
known homosexuals from military service. __Through this 
Directive, the military officially stated for the first time that 
"[h]omosexuality is incompatible with military service." DOD 
Directive 1332.14 (1981). 

On July 19, 1993, President Clinton announced a new compromise 
policy regarding homosexuals in the military.[n.~1] The principal 
elements of this new policy were enacted by Congress in the 
National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 1994 ("the 
Act"), codified at 10 U.S.C. Section 654 (Supp. 1994). The Act 
was signed by President Clinton on November 30, 1993. On 
December 21, 1993, the Department of Defense ("DOD") 
promulgated regulations implementing the new policy. These 
regulations were later modified and became effective on February 
28, 1994. _See_ DOD Directive 1332.14 (1994) (Enlisted 
Administrative Separations); DOD Directive 1332.30 (1994) 
(Separation of Regular Commissioned Officers); DOD Directive 
1304.26 (1994) (Qualification Standards for Enlistment, 
Appointment and Induction). The Act and the companion DOD 
Directives are colloquially referred to as the "Don't Ask, Don't 
Tell" policy. 

The Act contains six subsections, with the main "policy" 
provisions set forth in subsection (b). Subsection (b) reads as 
follows: 

(b) Policy.--A member of the armed forces _shall be separated_ 
from the armed forces under regulations prescribed by the 
Secretary of Defense if _one or more of the following findings_ is 
made and approved in accordance with procedures set forth in such 
regulations: 



(1) That the member has engaged in, attempted to engage in, or 
solicited another to engage in a _homosexual act_ or acts _unless_ 
there are further findings, made and approved in accordance with 
procedures set forth in such regulations, that the member has 
demonstrated that-- 



(A) such conduct is a departure from the member's usual and 
customary behavior; 



(B) such conduct, under all the circumstances, is unlikely to recur; 



(C) such conduct was not accomplished by use of force, coercion, 
or intimidation; 



(D) under the particular circumstances of the case, the member's 
continued presence in the armed forces is consistent with the 
interests of the armed forces in proper discipline, good order, and 
morale; and 



(E) the member does not have a propensity or intent to engage in 
homosexual acts. 



(2) _That the member has stated that he or she is a homosexual or 
bisexual, or words to that effect_, unless there is a further finding, 
made and approved in accordance with procedures set forth in the 
regulations, that the member has demonstrated that he or she is not 
a person who engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to 
engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts. 



(3) That the member has married or attempted to marry a person 
known to be of the same biological sex. 



10 U.S.C. Section 654(b) (Supp. 1994) (emphasis added).[n.~2] 
The primary justification for these measures is that "[t]he presence 
in the armed forces of persons who demonstrate a propensity or 
intent to engage in homosexual acts would create an unacceptable 
risk to the high standard of morale, good order and discipline, and 
unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability." 10 U.S.C. 
Section 654(a)(15) (Supp. 1994). 

The DOD's implementing Directives 1332.14 and 1332.30 are 
comparable to the Act.[n.~3] These regulations provide, in relevant 
part, as follows: 

Homosexual conduct is grounds for separation from the Military 
Services . . . . _Homosexual conduct includes homosexual acts, 
[or] a statement by a member that demonstrates a propensity or 
intent to engage in homosexual acts_ . . . . A statement by a 
member that demonstrates a propensity or intent to engage in 
homosexual acts is grounds for separation not because it reflects 
the member's sexual orientation, but because the statement 
indicates a likelihood that the member engages in or will engage in 
homosexual acts. _A member's sexual orientation is considered a 
personal and private matter, and it is not a bar to continued 
service_ under this section unless manifested by homosexual 
conduct in the manner described in section C.1. 



_See_ DOD Directive 1332.30 at 2-1 (emphasis added); __DOD 
Directive 1332.14 at 1-9. 

Under the new policy, the military no longer actively initiates 
investigations of service members to determine whether they are 
homosexual, DOD Directive 1332.30 at 8-1, and prospective new 
recruits are no longer questioned about their sexual orientation, 
DOD Directive 1304.26 at 1-5. However, a service member may 
not voluntarily acknowledge that he or she is gay without 
significant consequences. 

If a service member states that he or she is homosexual, that 
statement alone creates a "rebuttable _presumption_ that the 
[s]ervice member engages in, attempts to engage in, has a 
propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts." 
DOD Directive 1332.14 at 1-10; _Id._ 1332.30 at 2-2 (same 
language applied to officers). __The service member will be 
discharged _unless_ he or she can prove by a preponderance of the 
evidence that "he or she does not engage in, have a propensity to 
engage in or intend to engage in homosexual acts." __DOD 
Directive 1332.14 at 1-10, 4-3; _Id._ 1332.30 at 2-2, 2-3. 

II. _Facts and Proceedings_

A. _Lt. Holmes' Role in the CANG and USANG_ 

The material facts of this case are not in dispute. Lt. Holmes was 
an officer in the CANG and the USANG. He enrolled in the 
CANG in 1986. (Holmes Decl. Paragraph 2.) In March 1989, he 
was sworn in as an officer of the CANG, and thereafter, as an 
officer in the USANG. (_Id_.) During his tenure with the CANG, 
Lt. Holmes was promoted to First Lieutenant and received the 
Army Achievement Medal, the Army Reserve Components 
Achievement Medal and the National Defense Service Ribbon 
while deployed to Germany in support of Operation Desert Shield 
and Operation Desert Storm. (_Id__._ Paragraph 3, 4.) His 
performance ratings have been uniformly exemplary, and his unit 
has been characterized as a "shining example of cohesion." (_Id_. 
Paragraph 4.) 

On June 3, 1993, Lt. Holmes sent a memorandum to his CANG 
commanding officer which stated that, "[A]s a matter of 
conscience, honesty and pride, I am compelled to inform you that I 
am gay." On that basis, Lt. Holmes' commanding officer initiated a 
request that Lt. Holmes' federal recognition as an officer be 
withdrawn. (_Id._ Paragraphs 5-6.) 

On May 21, 1994, discharge proceedings were commenced against 
Lt. Holmes. The Federal Recognition Board ("the Board") 
considered his case under the new policy purporting to exclude 
gays from the military based on their conduct. (_See_ 
Administrative Record.) The Board found that Lt. Holmes' 
admission that he is gay created a rebuttable presumption that he 
had engaged in or was likely to engage in homosexual acts, and 
that Lt. Holmes had failed to rebut that presumption. Despite Lt. 
Holmes' outstanding record of service, the Board recommended the 
withdrawal of his federal recognition. Based solely upon the loss of 
federal recognition, the CANG discharged Lt. Holmes. 

B. _The Instant Litigation_

On February 28, 1995, Lt. Holmes commenced the instant action 
against the Federal and California defendants. Lt. Holmes filed a 
First Amended Complaint on April 17, 1995 which alleges thirteen 
claims for relief based on federal and state law. The first seven 
claims are directed solely against the California defendants, and 
allege violations of: (1) his right to equal protection under the 
California Constitution; (2) his right to freedom of speech under 
the California Constitution; (3) his right to privacy under the 
California Constitution; (4) California Labor Code Sections 1101, 
1102, and 1102.1; (5) California Government Code Section 
18500(c)(5); (6) Executive Order B-54-79; and (7) the Equal 
Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States 
Constitution. 

The remaining six claims of the First Amended Complaint are 
premised on the United States Constitution and are alleged against 
all defendants. These claims are based on the doctrines of equal 
protection, free speech and free expression, vagueness and 
overbreadth, intimate associations, substantive due process, and 
privacy.[n.~4] Lt. Holmes seeks, _inter_ _alia_, a declaration that 
the Act and Directives are unconstitutional as applied to him under 
both the United States and California Constitutions, a preliminary 
and permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from enforcing 
the Act and Directives, immediate reinstatement of plaintiff's 
officer status with the USANG and reinstatement to the CANG. 

C. _Substantive Motions Before the Court_ 

The parties have filed various motions to resolve the claims alleged 
by Lt. Holmes in his First Amended Complaint. Specifically, the 
California defendants move for dismissal of plaintiff's complaint 
pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).[n.~5] In their 
memorandum, the California defendants appear to advance the 
following arguments in support of their motion to dismiss: (1) 
plaintiff's claims are moot; (2) the California defendants' are not 
legally responsible for Holmes' discharge because their actions are 
mandated by federal law; (3) plaintiff's claims are barred by the 
doctrine of sovereign immunity as set forth in the Eleventh 
Amendment; and (4) each of plaintiff's state law causes of action 
fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. 

The Federal defendants have separately filed a Motion to Dismiss, 
or in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment, which addresses the 
substantive merits of each of plaintiff's federal claims. In response, 
plaintiff has filed a Cross-Motion for Summary Adjudication as to 
Federal Defendants and Motion for Summary Adjudication as to 
California Defendants. Plaintiff's motion addresses his federal 
claims only. 

In light of the myriad issues presented, the Court will first discuss 
whether Lt. Holmes has alleged viable state law claims against the 
California defendants. The Court will then address Lt. Holmes' 
federal claims to determine whether they are subject to dismissal, 
or whether they should be summarily adjudicated in favor of 
plaintiff. That discussion will commence with an analysis of the 
defenses raised by the California defendants, followed by a 
substantive discussion of each of the federal claims as they relate 
to all defendants.  

Before turning to the substantive merits of plaintiff's claims, 
however, the Court must assess plaintiff's request to strike the 
California defendants' untimely opposition to plaintiff's cross-
motion for summary adjudication. 





D. _Plaintiff's Motion to Strike_

On June 23, 1995, the Court entered a scheduling order pursuant to 
the stipulated request of the parties.[n.~6] This stipulated order 
provided that plaintiff was required to file his opposition to the 
defendants' motions along with a cross-motion for summary 
judgment on his federal claims by June 20, 1995. The order further 
provided that the defendants were required to file their replies in 
support of their respective motions _and_ their oppositions to 
plaintiff's cross-motion by no later than July 3, 1995. Plaintiff was 
required to file his replies to the defendants' oppositions by no later 
than July 11, 1995. 

Plaintiff timely filed a combined opposition to the Federal 
defendants' motion and cross-motion for summary adjudication of 
his federal claims. However, the California defendants did not file 
their opposition to plaintiff's cross-motion until July 10, 1995, a 
full week after their brief was due, nor did they seek leave of the 
Court before doing so. Consequently, Lt. Holmes now moves to 
strike the California defendants' opposition to his cross-motion for 
summary adjudication of his federal claims on the ground that it 
was filed outside the stipulated scheduling order issued by the 
Court and is therefore untimely. 

The district court has the discretion to strike untimely papers where 
the late-filing party fails to demonstrate excusable neglect. _Wood 
v. Santa Barbara Chamber of Commerce_, 705 F.2d 1515, 1519 
(9th Cir. 1983), _cert. denied_, 465 U.S. 1081 (1984) (district court 
did not abuse its discretion in striking untimely affidavits in 
opposition to summary judgment motion where party failed to 
request extension of time or show excusable neglect); _accord_ 
_Mendez v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico_, 900 F.2d 4, 7-8 (1st 
Cir. 1990) ("the district court was not obliged to consider 
appellant's untimely opposition in applying the Rule 56 standard.") 
(citing _Wood_, 705 F.2d at 1519). Here, the California defendants 
argue that while the stipulated scheduling order provided for the 
filing of a "motion for summary judgment", it did not contemplate 
a "motion for summary adjudication." As such, the California 
defendants argue that their opposition to plaintiff's motion was not 
governed by the stipulated scheduling order, and that their 
opposition was timely under the Local Rules then in effect. 

The rationalization proffered by the California defendants strains 
credulity. The stipulated scheduling order clearly stated that 
plaintiff intended to file a summary judgment motion on his 
_federal_ _claims_ -- which is precisely what plaintiff filed. The 
fact that the motion was styled as a motion for "summary 
adjudication" as opposed to a motion for "summary judgment" is a 
distinction without a difference. Both motions are cognizable under 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 and are governed by the same 
standard of review. _See_ _United States v. 1982 Sanger 24' 
Spectra Boat_, 738 F.2d 1043, 1046 (9th Cir. 1984) (finding that 
the substance of a motion, as opposed to how it is styled, 
determines how the motion should be construed)____.[n.~7] Thus, 
the Court finds the California defendants' proffered explanation for 
their failure to comply with the stipulated scheduling order issued 
by the Court to be unacceptable. 

The California defendants' inexplicable failure to comply with the 
stipulated scheduling order has unnecessarily resulted in additional 
expenditures of resources by counsel for the plaintiff. Indeed, the 
California defendants' justification for the late filing comes 
perilously close to violating Rule 11. Under the circumstances 
presented, the Court finds that the California defendants' papers 
filed in opposition to Lt. Holmes' cross-motion for summary 
adjudication of his federal claims should be stricken from the 
record. 

In any event, the Court notes that consideration of the California 
defendants' untimely opposition brief would not have altered the 
outcome of this action. Their opposition brief largely repeats the 
arguments raised in their motion to dismiss. Moreover, like their 
other papers, the California defendants' opposition contains a 
plethora of improper invective and ad hominem attacks on the 
plaintiff, and was, for the most part, lacking in any cogent legal 
analysis.[n.~8] 

_DISCUSSION_

I. _Standards of Review_

A. _Summary Judgment_

Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, summary judgment is 
warranted against a party who "fails to make a showing sufficient 
to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's 
case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." 
___Celotex Corp. v. Catrett_, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986). There 
is no issue for trial unless there is sufficient evidence favoring the 
nonmoving party for a jury to return a verdict for that party. 
_Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc_, 477 U.S. 242, __249 (1986). 

In opposing a summary judgment motion, the nonmoving party 
must come forward with specific facts demonstrating a genuine 
factual issue for trial. _Matsushita Elec. Indus.__ Co., Ltd. v. 
Zenith Radio Corp._, 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986). Thus, an 
opposition which fails to identify and reference triable facts is 
insufficient to preclude the Court's granting of a properly supported 
summary judgment motion. _See_ _Nilsson, Robbins, Dalgarn, 
Berliner, Carson & Wurst v. Louisiana Hydrolec_, 854 F.2d 1538, 
1545 (9th Cir. 1988). Nonetheless, any inferences to be drawn 
from the facts must be viewed in a light most favorable to the party 
opposing the motion. _T.W. Elec. Serv. v. Pacific Elec. 
Contractors Ass'n_, 809 F.2d 626, 631 (9th Cir. 1987). 

B. _Failure to State a Claim_

Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a motion to 
dismiss should not be granted unless it appears beyond a doubt that 
the plaintiff "can prove no set of facts in support of his claim 
which would entitle him to relief." _Conley v. Gibson_, 355 U.S. 
41, 45-46 (1957). For purposes of such a motion, the complaint is 
construed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff and all properly 
pleaded factual allegations are taken as true. _Jenkins v. 
McKeithen_, 395 U.S. 411, 421 (1969); _Everest and Jennings, 
Inc. v. American Motorists Ins. Co._, 23 F.3d 226, 228 (9th Cir. 
1994). 

II. _State Law Claims_

Plaintiff has advanced six claims for relief against the California 
defendants which are premised solely on state law. __In their 
motion to dismiss, the California defendants contend that these 
claims are barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The 
Court agrees. Under the Eleventh Amendment, federal courts are 
barred from deciding state law claims against a state or its officials. 
_Pennhurst State School & Hosp. v. Halderman_, 465 U.S. 89, 106 
(1984); ___accord_ _Han v. U.S. Dept. of Justice_, 45 F.3d 333, 
338 (9th Cir. 1995).[n.~9] Unless a state has waived its Eleventh 
Amendment immunity or Congress has overridden it, a state 
cannot be sued regardless of the relief sought. _Kentucky v. 
Graham_, 473 U.S. 159, 167 n.14 (1985) (citing _Alabama v. 
Pugh_, 438 U.S. 781 (1978)). 

Plaintiff mistakenly relies on an exception to the doctrine of 
sovereign immunity known as the _Ex Parte Young_ exception, 
which provides that the Eleventh Amendment does not foreclose 
claims against a state where the plaintiff seeks only prospective 
injunctive relief. _Ex parte Young_, 209 U.S. 123, 155-56 (1908); 
_Committee to Save Mokelumne River v. East Bay Municipal 
Utility Dist._, 13 F.3d 305, 309 (9th Cir. 1993), _cert. denied_, 115 
S.Ct. 198 (1994). While the _Ex parte Young_ exception may save 
plaintiff's federal claims, (_see_ discussion _supra_ at 28), it has 
no application to plaintiff's state law claims. ___See_ _Ulaleo v. 
Paty_, 902 F.2d 1395, 1400 (9th Cir. 1990). The Court therefore 
grants the California defendants' motion to dismiss as it relates to 
plaintiff's state law causes of action, which are set forth in the First 
Amended Complaint as plaintiff's first through sixth claims for 
relief. These claims are dismissed without prejudice to plaintiff 
bringing said claims in the appropriate state forum. 

III. _Federal Claims_

Both the California and Federal defendants' respective motions 
seek dismissal of plaintiff's federal claims, while plaintiff's cross-
motion seeks summary adjudication of those claims in his favor. 
The Court will address the merits of plaintiff's federal claims by 
first analyzing the arguments germane only to the California 
defendants. Following that discussion, the Court will discuss the 
merits of each of plaintiff's individual federal claims. 

A. _Defenses Raised By the California Defendants_ 

1. _Overview of the National Guard_

To place the California defendants' arguments in context, the Court 
will briefly review the structure of the CANG and its relationship 
to the USANG. 

The National Guard is the modern-day equivalent of the "militia." 
___Maryland v. United States_, 381 U.S. 41, 46, _vacated on other 
grounds_, 382 U.S. 159 (1965). The Constitution authorizes 
Congress to "provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the 
Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions." 
U.S. Const., art. I, Section 8, cl. 15. The Constitution also gives 
Congress the power to "provide for organizing, arming, and 
disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as 
may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to 
the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the 
Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline 
prescribed by Congress." U.S. Const., art. I, Section 8, cl. 16. 
These clauses are commonly described as the "Militia Clauses." 
___Perpich v. Department of Defense_, 496 U.S. 334, 337 n.3 
(1990). 

From 1903 to 1933, Congress passed a series of acts and 
amendments which completely overhauled the state militia system. 
_See_ _id._ at 341-45. Those acts established the National Guard 
system, which consists of "'two overlapping but distinct 
organizations' . . . the National Guard of the various States and the 
National Guard of the United States." _Id._ at 345. "Since 1933 all 
persons who have enlisted in a State National Guard unit have 
simultaneously enlisted in the National Guard of the United 
States." _Id._ Thus, National Guardsmen "now must keep three 
hats in their closets -- a civilian hat, a state militia hat, and an army 
hat -- only one of which is worn at any particular time." _Id._ at 
348. 

Officers are first commissioned in a state National Guard. 
"[S]election and appointment of [state] Army National Guard 
officers is _solely_ a state responsibility." _MacFarlane v. 
Grasso_, 696 F.2d 217, 226 n.4 (2d Cir. 1982) (emphasis added). 
"Upon appointment in the Army National Guard of a State . . . an 
individual has a State status under which he can function." _Id_. 
An officer commissioned as an officer into the state national guard 
may become an officer in the USANG upon a grant of federal 
recognition. 32 U.S.C. Section 307(d); _Dehne v. United States_, 
970 F.2d 890, 891 (Fed. Cir. 1992). "Federal recognition is the 
acknowledgement by the Federal Government that an officer [of 
the state militia] appointed, promoted, or transferred to an 
authorized grade or position vacancy in the Army National Guard 
[of the United States] meets the prescribed laws and regulation[s] 
governing the [appointment, promotion, or transfer]." _Frey v. 
State of Cal._, 982 F.2d 399, 400 n.3 (9th Cir.), _cert. denied_, 113 
S.Ct. 3000 (1993). 

State National Guards receive federal funding by maintaining 
federally-recognized units; "[s]tates that fail to comply with federal 
regulations risk forfeiture of federal funds allocated to organize, 
equip and arm state Guards." _Charles v. Rice_, 28 F.3d 1312, 
1315-316 (1st Cir. 1994) (citing 32 U.S.C. Sections 101, 107, 108, 
501 and _Knutson v. Wisconsin Air Nat'l Guard_, 995 F.2d 765, 
767 (7th Cir. 1993), _cert. denied_, 114 S.Ct. 347 (1993)). 
Therefore, most, if not all, states primarily commission those 
individuals who meet federal qualifications. _MacFarlane_, 696 
F.2d at 226 n.4; _see_ Cal. Mil. & Vet. Code Section 222 
("Persons to be commissioned in the National Guard shall be 
selected from those eligible for federal recognition . . . ."). The 
USANG is composed of all the federally-recognized members of 
the state Army National Guards. 32 U.S.C. Section 101(4)(D). 
When not in the active service of the United States, such units are 
predominantly state entities and are under the command of the 
governor. _MacFarlane_, 696 F.2d at 226 n.4. 

Once a state officer receives a federal commission, his "capacity 
and general fitness" to retain his federal recognition can be 
investigated at any time by an efficiency board composed of 
commissioned officers of the Regular Military, USANG or both. 
32 U.S.C. Section 323(b). The findings and recommendations of 
such boards are reviewed by the Chief of the National Guard 
Bureau ("NGB"), a joint bureau of the Department of the Army 
and the Department of the Air Force. If the NGB agrees with a 
negative report from the efficiency board, the officer loses his 
federal recognition. 

2. _Plaintiff's Claims Are Not Moot_

Article III of the Constitution limits federal judicial power to 
"Cases" and "Controversies." _United States Parole Comm'n v. 
Geraghty_, 445 U.S. 388, 395 (1980). Under this limitation, "a 
case becomes moot when the issues presented are no longer 'live' 
or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome." 
_Murphy v. Hunt_, 455 U.S. 478, 481 (1982) (citing _Geraghty_, 
445 U.S. at 396); _accord_ _Western Oil and Gas Ass'n v. Sonoma 
County_, 905 F.2d 1287, 1290 (9th Cir. 1990), _cert. denied_, 498 
U.S. 1067 (1991). When a matter becomes moot, the Court no 
longer has jurisdiction over the action. _County of Los Angeles v. 
Davis_, 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979). 

In the instant case, the California defendants maintain that this 
action should be dismissed as moot because plaintiff has admitted 
that he has engaged in homosexual acts, and hence, cannot regain 
his federal recognition. (Cal. Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss at 4-5.) This 
contention lacks merit. The California defendants cite no authority, 
evidentiary or otherwise, to support this assertion. In fact, the only 
"act" which plaintiff has engaged in is acknowledging that he is 
gay.[n.~10] Since plaintiff is challenging the constitutionality of 
the military's policy which effectively equates an 
acknowledgement of status with proscribed conduct, the issues 
before the Court are "live" for jurisdictional purposes. The Court 
therefore rejects the California defendants' mootness argument. 

3. _The California Defendants' Preemption Defense Lacks Merit_ 





The California defendants next contend that they cannot be held 
liable for Holmes' discharge because they were bound by the 
Federal defendants' decision to withdraw Holmes' federal 
recognition, and that their discharge of plaintiff was simply a 
"ministerial" act. (_See_ Cal. Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss at 2, 5-8.) In 
support of this contention, the California defendants' rely primarily 
on 32 U.S.C. Section 324(a), which they assert directly compels 
the states to discharge National Guard officers who lose their 
federal recognition. They also cite 10 U.S.C. Section654(b) as 
necessarily preempting state regulation of the National Guard 
members -- even when the Guard is in state service. 

a. _32 U.S.C. Section 324(a)(2)_

Section 324(a) provides that "[a]n officer of the National Guard 
shall be discharged when . . . his Federal recognition is 
withdrawn." 32 U.S.C. Section 324(a)(2). It is not readily apparent 
to which National Guard (in this case, CANG or USANG) the 
statute refers. Nevertheless, the California defendants assert that 
__"loss of federal recognition means automatic discharge from the 
California National Guard." (Cal. Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss at 6.) 

At first blush, the definitions applicable to Title 32 arguably 
support the California defendants' interpretation. The United States 
Code defines "'National Guard' [to mean] the _Army_ _National_ 
_Guard_ and the Air National Guard." 32 U.S.C. Section 101(3). 
"'Army National Guard' means that part of the _organized_ 
_militia_ _of_ _the_ _several_ _States_ . . . ." 32 U.S.C. Section 
101(4) (emphasis added). The Army National Guard is 
distinguished from the "Army National Guard of the United 
States." 32 U.S.C. Section 101(5). Thus, the California defendants 
correctly state that section 324(a) can be read to regulate the 
discharge of officers from _state_ National Guards. 

__Notwithstanding the above, the Court disagrees with the 
California defendants that state compliance with section 324(a) is 
necessarily compelled by the Supremacy Clause. "The termination 
of the appointment of a commissioned officer of the National 
Guard is a function of the State authorities." 32 U.S.C. Section 
1101.5. Consistent with this authority, this Circuit in _Frey_ 
explicitly recognized that the power of appointing or terminating a 
state National Guard officer is a matter left to the states. _Frey_, 
982 F.2d at 402 (citing cases and statutes); ___see also_ _U.S. v. 
Dern_, 74 F.2d 485, 487 (D.C. Cir. 1934) ("The United States has 
not appointed, and constitutionally cannot appoint _or_ _remove_ 
(except after being called into federal service), officers of the 
National Guard . . . .") (emphasis added). Although the loss of 
federal recognition precludes the officer's membership in the 
National Guard of the United States, the officer may still be a 
member of the National Guard of the state. _See_ _MacFarlane_, 
__696 F.2d at 226 n.4. 

Indeed, direct federal control over state militia personnel decisions, 
through the granting and withdrawing of "federal recognition," 
would completely eviscerate the appointment power reserved to the 
states in the Militia Clauses. Therefore, section 324(a) would be 
constitutionally infirm if, as the California defendants urge, it 
requires the discharge of a _state_-appointed officer in _state_ 
service merely for losing _federal_ recognition. 

__Section 324(a) does _not_ purport to preempt state law. Rather, 
it regulates the states only indirectly, as part of a conditional 
spending program. "State control in administering matters such as 
training, _personnel_, logistics, doctrine, and military justice has 
been eliminated _by a system of federal conditional spending_." P. 
T. Mullins, _The Militia Clauses, the National Guard, and 
Federalism: A Constitutional Tug of War_, 57 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 
328, 343 (1988) (emphasis added).  

The only effective control exercised by the federal government and 
the regular armed forces relative to organizing, equipping, training 
and policies of the National Guard of any of the States _comes 
from the control of the funds_ which may be granted to or withheld 
from the National Guard units pursuant to granting or withdrawing 
federal recognition. 



_Don't Ruin Our Park v. Stone_, 749 F. Supp. 1386, 1388 (M.D. 
Pa. 1990) (emphasis added); __32 U.S.C. Section 108 (President 
may withhold federal funds if state fails to comply with any Title 
32 provision); _accord_ _Charles_, __28 F.3d at 1315; Mullins, 
_supra_, at 343 ("This purse string has been used to put the states 
in a 'catch-22' situation -- retain autonomy and lose funding or 
accept funding and submit to federal control."). 

Through the federal recognition system, Congress has effectively 
circumvented the Militia Clauses' limitation on federal control of 
militia personnel. Unable or unwilling to forego federal funding, 
states have voluntarily restrained the exercise of their appointment 
power by primarily commissioning individuals who are eligible for 
federal recognition. Thus, even though federal recognition 
ostensibly does not occur until _after_ the state has appointed an 
officer, in practical effect, federal recognition determines who may 
receive a state commission. Similarly, states are effectively forced 
to discharge or transfer officers who lose their federal recognition 
in order to preserve federal recognition and funding of the officers' 
units. Nonetheless, at least with respect to personnel decisions, 
states ultimately _choose_ to comply with federal National Guard 
policies.[n.~11] At the risk of losing funding, states are free to 
break from Section 324(a) and to retain in state service officers 
who lose their federal recognition.[n.~12] _See_ _MacFarlane_, 
696 F.2d at 226 n.4. 

This fact is illustrated by the experience of at least one National 
Guard officer who lost his federal recognition but continued to 
serve in the California military. In _Frey_, __982 F.2d 399, 
Colonel Archer Frey__ brought suit against the state under federal 
age discrimination laws after being discharged for reaching a state-
imposed mandatory retirement age. Frey lost his federal 
recognition in 1985 because he had attained 30 years of 
commissioned service. However, "[f]rom 1985 until his mandatory 
retirement [in 1991], Frey served . . . as a military officer in the 
California National Guard." _Id._ at 400.  

The court noted, "As in Frey's case, one may be a member of the 
State National Guard, but not a member of the Army or Air 
National Guard of the United States." _Id._ at 400 n.2. __The court 
described the effects of loss of federal recognition: 

The loss of federal recognition means that the officer no longer 
participates in federally-paid duty status, which includes activities 
such as drills, annual training, or service schools at any cost to the 
federal government, nor may he be called into active federal 
service. 



_Id._ at 400 n.3. Significantly absent from this list of consequences 
is "automatic discharge." __Such a consequence would in fact 
render the enumerated consequences irrelevant. 

_Frey_ directly contradicts the California defendants' assertion that 
they must invariably follow and mechanically apply Section 
324(a). Colonel Frey's experience demonstrates that loss of federal 
recognition is not an absolute bar to service in California's National 
Guard. _See_ 11 Ops. Cal. Att'y Gen. 253, 261 (1948) 
("Withdrawal of federal recognition does not deprive the officer of 
his state commission."). Indeed, California law authorizes the 
commissioning of certain previously-discharged officers who "are 
no longer eligible for federal recognition." Cal. Mil. & Vet. Code 
Section 222. In contrast, no California statute expressly requires 
the discharge of an officer who loses federal recognition.  

The California defendants fail to appreciate the role of conditional 
spending in Congress' regulation of the state Guards, and their 
interpretation of Section 324(a) burdens the statute with a serious 
constitutional infirmity. Furthermore, the California defendants' 
position is contradicted by a recent example of noncompliance 
with Section 324(a). Therefore, the Court rejects the California 
defendants' argument that section 324(a) left them with no choice 
but to discharge Holmes. 

b. _10 U.S.C. Section 654(b)_

The California defendants also contend that they had no control 
over Holmes' discharge because the federal government's anti-
homosexual policy (10 U.S.C. Section 654(b)) controls "[i]n both 
the state and federal 'halves' of the National Guard . . . ." (Cal. 
Defs.' Reply at 16.) For this proposition, they apparently rely on 
_Johnson v. Orr_, 617 F. Supp. 170 (E.D. Cal. 1985), _aff'd_, 787 
F.2d 597 (9th Cir. 1986). In ___Johnson_, a lesbian member of the 
California National Guard was discharged, pursuant to the federal 
military regulations that preceded the present policy, after 
informing her commander of her sexual orientation. The district 
court, without citing any authority other than the text of the Militia 
Clauses, ruled that federal regulations applied to National Guard 
officers even in their _state_ capacity by virtue of Congress' power 
to "discipline" the militia. _Johnson_, 617 F. Supp. at 177 
(emphasis added). The Ninth Circuit affirmed in an unpublished 
decision. _See_ __787 F.2d 597 (9th Cir. 1986). 

More recent Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit cases, however, 
suggest that _Johnson_ is no longer reliable authority. In__ 
_Gilliam v. Miller_, 973 F.2d 760 (9th __Cir. 1992)__, two 
plaintiffs brought suit after being discharged from the Oregon 
Army National Guard ("ORARNG") for failing to comply with 
federal military weight control regulations.[n.~13] Attempting to 
state a claim under the federal Administrative Procedures Act, the 
plaintiffs argued that the Oregon Adjutant General acted as a 
federal agent when he applied the regulations and removed them 
from the ORARNG. A magistrate judge recommended, and the 
district court initially approved, a finding favorable to the 
plaintiffs.  

The Adjutant General moved for reconsideration after the Supreme 
Court, in its _Perpich_ decision, provided a new analysis of the 
National Guard system. The district court granted the motion and 
found, pursuant to the conceptual framework articulated in 
_Perpich_, that the Adjutant General had been wearing his "state 
militia hat" when he discharged the plaintiffs. The court reversed 
its initial finding and dismissed the complaints for failure to state a 
claim.  

The Ninth Circuit affirmed. Rejecting the argument that federal, 
not state, law controlled, the court held that the regulations were 
applicable to the plaintiffs not because they preempted state law, 
but because the state voluntarily incorporated them _into_ state 
law. _Id._ at 761 n.2 and 763. Thus, "the adoption of federal 
training requirements for members of ORARNG by the Oregon 
Legislature was not a sham," as it would have been if those 
requirements had already preempted state law. _Id._ at 763. When 
the Adjutant General discharged the plaintiffs from state service, 
he did so "solely in the capacity of a state actor," "fulfilling his role 
under state law," and not "under federal control." _Id._ at 764; 
_see_ _Zitser v. Walsh_, 352 F. Supp. 438, 440 (D.C. Conn. 1972) 
(where Connecticut Army National Guard colonel used a federally-
promulgated regulation to determine officer's qualifications, "state 
law commanded him to apply that regulation"). 

_____Gilliam_ cannot be reconciled with the Ninth Circuit's 
decision in _Johnson_. Those cases squarely reach opposite 
conclusions on the question of whether regulation of the National 
Guard when not in federal service is a state or federal function. In 
addition to being a more recent case, _Gilliam_ more likely 
expresses the Ninth Circuit's present position because it followed, 
and expressly relied on, the Supreme Court's analysis of the 
National Guard system in _Perpich_. _See_ _id._ at 763-64. 
Therefore, this Court finds that _Gilliam_ controls and that 
_Perpich_ and _Gilliam_ together have implicitly overruled 
_Johnson_____. 

In light of _Gilliam_, the California defendants cannot maintain 
that they acted only "ministerially" in following 10 U.S.C. 654(b); 
rather, they acted under color of state law. The California 
defendants were required to enforce the policy only because, and 
indeed if, California has adopted that policy. The Court therefore 
rejects the California defendants' claim that Section 654(b) 
preempted their authority over Holmes' service. 

4. _Plaintiff's Federal Claims Are Not Barred By the Doctrine of 
Sovereign Immunity_ 





Finally, the California defendants argue that the doctrine of 
sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment bars plaintiff's 
_federal_ claims for relief alleged against them. The Court rejects 
this argument. Under the _Ex parte Young_ exception, a suit 
against a state official seeking relief from unconstitutional state 
action is not a suit against the state, even if the state is the real 
party in interest. _Ex parte Young_, 209 U.S. at 160; _Kentucky_, 
__473 U.S. at 167 n.14____. "The _Ex Parte Young_ exception is 
necessary to permit the federal courts to vindicate federal rights 
and hold state officials responsible to the supreme authority of the 
United States." _Almond Hill School v. U.S. Dept. of 
Agriculture_, 768 F.2d 1030, 1034 (9th Cir. 1985) (internal 
quotation marks and citations omitted). Since plaintiff is seeking 
prospective injunctive relief preventing the California defendants 
from violating his rights under the United States Constitution, 
plaintiff may proceed on his federal claims against the California 
defendants. _Demery v. Kupperman_, 735 F.2d 1139, 1146 (9th 
Cir. 1984), _cert. denied sub. nom_, 469 U.S. 1127 (1985). 

B. _Equal Protection_

In his Sixth and Seventh Claims for Relief, Lt. Holmes alleges that 
the disparate treatment of homosexual and heterosexual service 
members under the Act and Directives constitutes a violation of his 
right to equal protection under the United States Constitution. As 
will be set forth below, the Court finds merit to this claim and 
concludes that the Act and Directives: (1) impermissibly 
discriminate against homosexual service members on the basis of 
sexual orientation as opposed to homosexual conduct; (2) fail to 
rationally further a legitimate governmental interest; and (3) are 
irrational as a matter of law because they are founded on and give 
effect to the prejudices and biases of others. These issues will be 
discussed seriatim. 

1. ___The Rational Basis Test_

The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment 
commands that no State shall "deny to any person within its 
jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." U.S. Const. am. XIV 
Section 1. This is essentially "a direction that all persons similarly 
situated should be treated alike." _City of Cleburne v. Cleburne 
Living Center_, 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985) (quoting _Plyler v. 
Doe_, 457 U.S. 202, 216 (1982)); _Jackson Water Works v. Public 
Utils. Comm'n_, 793 F.2d 1090, 1092 (9th Cir. 1986), _cert. 
denied_, 479 U.S. 1102 (1987). Although the Fourteenth 
Amendment expressly applies only to the states, the protections 
afforded thereunder apply equally to federal legislation, albeit 
through the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. _Cecelia 
Packing Corp. v. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture_, 10 F.3d 616, 623-24 
(9th Cir. 1993). 

There are three levels of judicial review applicable to equal 
protection challenges: strict scrutiny, heightened scrutiny, and 
rational basis review. ___High Tech Gays v. Defense Indus. 
Security Clearance Office_, 895 F.2d 563, 571 (9th Cir.), _reh'g 
denied_, 909 F.2d 375 (9th Cir. 1990). This Circuit has previously 
held that gays are not a suspect class, and therefore, classifications 
affecting homosexuals as a class are subject only to rational basis 
review. _Id_.[n.~14] 

Under a rational basis framework, the relevant inquiry with respect 
to an equal protection challenge is whether the challenged action 
"rationally furthers a legitimate state purpose or interest." _San 
Antonio School Dist. v. Rodriguez_, 411 U.S. 1, 55 (1973); 
_United States v. Harding_, 971 F.2d 410, 412 (9th Cir. 1992), 
_cert. denied_, 506 U.S. 1070 (1993). "[I]f there is a rational 
relationship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate 
governmental purpose," the discriminatory classification is 
presumed valid and must be sustained. _Heller v. Doe_, 113 S.Ct 
2637, 2642 (1993). Notwithstanding the strong presumption of 
validity, "the standard of rationality . . . must find some footing in 
the realities of the subject addressed by the legislation." ___Id._ 
__at 2643. 

The Court recognizes that in undertaking its analysis of plaintiff's 
equal protection claim, the judiciary must give deference to the 
military's judgment; the "military decisions by the Army are not 
lightly overruled by the judiciary." _Pruitt v. Cheney_, 963 F.2d 
1160, 1166 (9th Cir. 1991), _cert. denied_, 506 U.S. 1020 (1992); 
_Rostker v. Goldberg_, 453 U.S. 57, 65 (1980) ("it is difficult to 
conceive of an area of governmental activity in which the courts 
have less competence.")__ (quoting _Gilligan v. Morgan_, 413 
U.S. 1, 10 (1973)). However, while military decisions are entitled 
to substantial deference, such deference should not be construed 
"to say that Congress is free to disregard the Constitution when it 
acts in the area of military affairs." _Rostker_, __453 U.S. at 67. 
The military is not the final arbiter of the constitutionality of its 
policies, and it must operate within the parameters established by 
statute and the Constitution. ___Id_.; _Goldman v. Weinberger_, 
475 U.S. 503, 523 (1986) (Brennan, J., dissenting) ("It is not the 
province of the federal courts to second-guess the professional 
judgments of the military services, but we are bound by the 
Constitution to assure ourselves that there exists a rational 
foundation for assertions of military necessity."). 

2. _The Policy Unconstitutionally Discriminates on the Basis of 
Status_ 



a. _Conduct is Equated With Status_





The threshold issue presented with respect to plaintiff's equal 
protection claim is whether the policy excludes service members 
only on the basis of homosexual ___conduct_, or whether it 
discriminates against homosexuals based on their _status_ (i.e., 
sexual orientation). In the context of military service, the Ninth 
Circuit has recognized that it is "constitutionally permissible" to 
exclude service members based on "homosexual _conduct_." 
_Meinhold v. U.S. Dept. of Defense_, 34 F.3d 1469, 1477 (9th Cir. 
1994). This Circuit, however, has also held that a discharge based 
on the service member's "_status_ as a homosexual" states an equal 
protection claim. _Pruitt_, __963 F.2d at 1164 (emphasis added); 
_Meinhold_, 34 F.3d at 1477. 

The Federal defendants assert that the new policy addresses 
homosexual _conduct_, not homosexual _status_ or 
_orientation_.[n.~15] Yet, the actual language of the policy belies 
this assertion. The Directives define "_sexual_ _orientation_" as 
"[a]n _abstract sexual preference_ for persons of a particular sex, 
as distinct from a propensity or intent to engage in sexual acts." 
DOD Directive 1332.30 at 1-2 (emphasis added). "_Propensity_ to 
engage in homosexual acts means more than an abstract preference 
or desire to engage in homosexual acts; it indicates _a likelihood 
that a person engages in or will engage in homosexual acts._" _Id._ 
at 1-1 (emphasis added).  

However, the policy further provides that a service member's or 
officer's statement "that he or she is a homosexual" by itself 
"demonstrates a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts, 
homosexual orientation is equated with a "propensity" to engage in 
homosexual acts, which, in turn, is deemed sufficient to warrant 
expulsion from the military. The policy thus _collapses_ that 
which it purports to treat as distinct. Certainly, if "orientation" or 
"status" and "propensity" are genuinely distinct concepts under the 
new policy, _the former would not be used to define the latter_. 
"Neither the Act nor the Directives explain how to differentiate an 
'orientation' from a 'propensity,' _although the Act's avowed policy 
to insure that 'homosexual orientation' not be treated as a 'bar' to 
service would seem to make such differentiation crucial._" _Able 
v. United States_, 880 F. Supp. 968, 975 (E.D.N.Y. 1995) 
(emphasis added). 

Tellingly, the military apparently recognizes the questionable 
nature of the distinction the policy attempts to create between 
status and conduct. During the Senate Committee hearings, the 
military conceded that the possibility that a service member can 
"have the orientation without the propensity" is only a 
"hypothetical" one. S. Hrg. 103-845 at 800. The military further 
recognized that a mere declaration of sexual orientation, such as "I 
am gay," is tantamount to homosexual conduct, even though there 
is no evidence of such conduct: 







Senator COHEN: Okay. So let me come back to the final point. 
We have a situation, then, where _a mere declaration that one is a 
homosexual, that is "conduct," under your interpretation of the rule 
that is going to be adopted._ 



Ms. GORELICK: _That is correct_. That is consistent with the 
prior policy, Senator. 



Senator COHEN: And even though there is _no evidence of 
conduct_, per se-- 



Ms. GORELICK: _That is correct_.



S. Hrg. 103-845 at 819 (emphasis added). 

The DOD's admissions, coupled with the circuitous definitions 
contained in the Directives, clearly reveal that the policy is 
designed to -- and effectively permits -- the military to exclude 
homosexuals from military service based solely on their status or 
orientation. The professed focus on proscribed conduct is little 
more than a thinly veiled attempt to camouflage this deception 
under a veneer of apparent constitutionality. Any purported 
distinction between status and conduct under the policy is purely 
illusory. As such, the Act and Directives discriminate on the basis 
of homosexual status, and therefore, fail to comport with the 
notions of equal protection under the Constitution. _Pruitt_, __963 
F.2d at 1164. 

b. _The Rebuttable Presumption Does Not Address the Court's 
Constitutional Concerns_ 



Defendants counter that the new policy does, in fact, treat status 
and conduct as separate and distinct concepts. As support for this 
proposition, defendants point to 10 U.S.C Section 654(b)(2), which 
ostensibly provides service members with the opportunity to rebut 
the presumption (which arises from a statement of homosexual 
orientation) that they intend or have a propensity to engage in 
homosexual conduct. Unfortunately,  

this "opportunity" fails to avoid the constitutional concerns of 
merging status with conduct because (1) service members have no 
meaningful opportunity to rebut the presumption, and (2) the 
existence and application of the presumption are constitutionally 
unsound. 

i. _The Presumption is Effectively Irrebuttable_ 





The policy does not provide a concrete method much less a 
realistic opportunity for a service member to prove that he or she 
does _not_ engage in, have a propensity to engage in, or intend to 
engage in homosexual conduct. _Able_, 880 F. Supp. at 975 
("Neither the Act nor the Directives suggest how one who is born 
with an innate tendency, an 'orientation' or a 'propensity,' to 
commit a homosexual act can prove that he or she does not have 
such an orientation or propensity.") Moreover, in drafting the 
policy, the DOD specifically intended to foreclose a self-identified 
homosexual service member from rebutting the presumption by "a 
promise to adhere to military standards of conduct in the future." S. 
Hrg. 103-112 at 294. Nor can the member rebut the presumption 
by "a statement to the effect that he or she has a propensity towards 
homosexuality but has not acted on it." _Id_. 

The DOD further acknowledged that the "opportunity" to rebut the 
presumption is only "hypothetically" possible in cases where the 
service member recants his statement by stating that "I was 
misunderstood, I did not mean it, it was a joke." S. Hrg. 103-845 at 
772.[n.~16] In other words, rebutting the presumption is 
_hypothetically_ possible if the military is convinced that the 
service member really is _not_ gay. _See_ _Thorne v. United 
States Dept. of Defense_, -- F. Supp. --, 1996 WL 96924 at *3 
(E.D. Va. 1996) ("Closely read, the statute is a tautology and hence 
the rebuttable presumption it purports to express is illusory, for it 
cannot be rebutted short of the declarant recanting the original 
statement declaring his or her homosexuality."). 

__ The Court also finds uncompelling the seven cases cited by the 
Federal defendants which they assert demonstrate that service 
members have successfully rebutted the presumption. (_See_ Fed. 
Defs.' Reply at 9-10; Naccarato Decl. Paragraph 2; Suppl. Galligan 
Decl. Paragraph 3.)[n.~17] Both the Naccarato and Galligan 
declarations submitted in support of the Federal defendants' motion 
are conspicuously silent as to __the facts and circumstances of any 
of those cases, and more importantly, the manner in which 
____these individuals allegedly rebutted the presumption that they 
engage in, attempt to engage in, have a propensity to engage in, or 
intend to engage in homosexual acts. Without this information, the 
mere contention that a handful of service members have 
successfully rebutted the presumption is of little, if any, probative 
value.[n.~18] 

ii. _The Rebuttable Presumption Violates Equal Protection_ 





__ In any event, even if the Court were convinced that gay service 
members were afforded a meaningful opportunity to rebut the 
presumption, the Court finds that the presumption is irrational. 

Preliminarily, the policy _assumes_ that __all service members 
who acknowledge their homosexuality will act in accordance with 
their orientation in the future and engage in proscribed conduct. 
This is constitutionally unacceptable. The Supreme Court has 
consistently found that conduct cannot be presumed to follow from 
a person's status. ___Jacobson v. United States_, 503 U.S. 540, 
551-552 (1992) (finding that the defendant's predisposition to act 
in a certain manner could "hardly support an inference" that he 
would commit crimes in the future); _Powell v. Texas_, 392 U.S. 
514, 543 (1968) (Black, J., concurring) (stating that "[p]unishment 
for a _status_ is particularly obnoxious . . . because it involves 
punishment for a _mere_ _propensity_, . . .") (emphasis added); 
_United States v. Robel_, 389 U.S. 258, 265-66 (1967) (finding 
that membership in an organization was insufficient basis on which 
to impute to him the organization's improper goals). Although 
these cases involved criminal proceedings, they "nevertheless point 
out the constitutionally significant danger of making status a 
surrogate for prohibited conduct." _Meinhold_, 34 F.3d at 1478 
(citing cases). 

Second, the presumption is not applied equally to heterosexual and 
homosexual service members. The policy provides that the 
rebuttable presumption arises only in cases involving self-
identified _homosexuals_, even if there is no actual evidence of 
homosexual conduct. Such is not the case for self-identified 
"_heterosexual_" service members: No presumption arises in cases 
involving _heterosexual_ service members who admit to 
_engaging_ in _homosexual_ _conduct_ but promise not to engage 
in future homosexual acts. ____DOD Directive 1332.30 at 2-2; S. 
Hearing 103-845 at 771-72; _Able_, 880 F. Supp. at 976 (citing S. 
Report 103-112 at 294).[n.~19] 

The Federal defendants contend that the military is justified in 
presuming gay service members will engage in proscribed conduct 
whereas their heterosexual counterparts will not because, unlike 
homosexual conduct, not all heterosexual acts are disallowed. 
(Reporter's Transcript ("RT") at 76:18-20.) They further assert that 
a presumption that gay status will lead to gay conduct is valid 
because few service members will remain celibate due to the power 
of the human sex drive. (_See_ Fed. Defs.' Reply at 4-5 (citing S. 
Rep. 112 at 281, 284).) The Federal defendants note that the D.C. 
Circuit followed this reasoning in upholding the constitutionality 
of the new policy. _See_ ___Steffan v. Perry_, 41 F.3d 677, 690 
(D.C. Cir. 1994) (stating that "the human sexual drive is 
enormously powerful and that an open declaration that one is a 
homosexual is a rather reliable indicator as to the direction of one's 
[sex] drive.") (en banc). The _Steffan_ majority assumed that 
homosexuals are unable to control their sexual urges. _See_ 
_Steffan_, 41 F.3d at 692. Consistent with the foregoing, the 
Federal defendants argue that the military need not wait for the 
proscribed act to occur in order to prevent its occurrence, and for 
that reason, the existence of the rebuttable presumption is 
rational.[n.~20] 

The Ninth Circuit in _Meinhold_, however, expressed skepticism 
as to whether a policy which presumes that _homo_sexuals will 
engage in proscribed conduct when no similar assumption is made 
with respect to _hetero_sexuals can ever pass muster under the 
Constitution:  

Here, the regulation as applied to Meinhold assumes that persons 
_who say they are gay_, but who have not acted in accordance with 
their propensity in the past, will nevertheless act in accordance 
with their propensity in the future--whether or not to do so is 
lawful or acceptable military behavior. _Yet no similar assumption 
is made with respect to service-members who are heterosexual._ 
[footnote omitted]. Although courts defer to the military's 
judgment about homosexual conduct, and classifications having to 
do with homosexuality may survive challenge if there is any 
rational basis for them, _see_ _Heller v. Doe_, -- U.S. --, --, 113 
S.Ct 2637, 2642-43, 125 L.Ed.2d 257 (1993); _High Tech Gays v. 
Defense Indus. Sec. Clearance Office_, 895 F.2d 563, 571 (9th Cir. 
1990), at least _a serious question is raised whether it can ever be 
rational to presume that one class of persons (identified by their 
sexual preference alone) will violate regulations whereas another 
class (identified by their preference) will not_. [footnote omitted] 



_Meinhold_, 34 F.3d at 1477-78 (emphasis added). The court 
further took issue with the military's contention that it need not 
wait until homosexual acts have occurred and been detected before 
taking personnel action: 

We acknowledge the force of the DOD's argument that it need not 
take the risk of a person with a homosexual desire or propensity 
acting on it because of the critical nature of the military mission. 
[citations.] However, [the] DOD is prepared to take the risk that a 
servicemember who has committed a homosexual act _but isn't 
homosexual_ won't do so again. _For that reason, its argument is 
not wholly rational. In any event, the risk factor alone does not 
eliminate equal protection difficulties._ 



___Id._ __at 1478 n.11 (emphasis added). 

The Federal defendants attempt to discount the significance of 
_Meinhold_ on the theory that it analyzed the pre-1994 policy 
excluding gays altogether. __(Fed. Defs.' Reply 6-7.) _Meinhold_ 
cannot be dismissed so lightly. In _Meinhold_, the Ninth Circuit 
recognized that the regulations then in effect _assumed_ that 
"persons who say they are gay, but who have not acted in 
accordance with their propensity in the past, will nevertheless act 
in accordance with their propensity in the future . . . ." 
___Meinhold_, 34 F.3d at 1477-78. Notably, the new policy, vis-a-
vis the rebuttable presumption, expressly states what was formerly 
assumed under the old policy.[n.~21] In doing so, Congress has 
enacted the precise constitutional infirmity which _Meinhold_ 
cautioned against: the conflation of homosexual status with 
homosexual conduct. 

The Court concludes that the policy does, in fact, discriminate 
against homosexual service members on the basis of status. The 
rebuttable presumption -- which is essentially irrebuttable and 
itself constitutionally unsound -- is a vehicle employed to obscure 
the congruence between the current policy and the former policy. 
In actuality, there is no meaningful distinction in this regard, as the 
current policy essentially elevates form over substance. Thus, 
under governing jurisprudence, the Court finds that Lt. Holmes' 
discharge violated his right to equal protection. 

__ 3. _The Policy Does Not Rationally Further a Legitimate 
Governmental Interest_ 



Assuming arguendo that the military's policy affecting 
homosexuals is not impermissibly premised on status, the next 
question is whether the policy "rationally furthers a legitimate state 
purpose or interest." _San Antonio School Dist. v. Rodriguez_, 411 
U.S. 1, 55 (1973). The Federal defendants assert the policy furthers 
the Government's interest in maintaining an effective military 
force. There is no dispute that this is a legitimate governmental 
interest. However, the parties vigorously contest whether the 
military's policy rationally furthers that goal. 

First, the Federal defendants maintain that the new policy is 
necessary to "accommodate the personal privacy interests" of 
heterosexual service members.[n.~22] (_See_ Fed. Defs.' Mot. at 
13-14.) The ostensible concern is that such privacy interests will be 
infringed upon by compelling heterosexual service members to 
live, sleep and shower with other persons who may find them 
sexually attractive. The military believes that heterosexual and 
homosexual personnel should not share billeting arrangements for 
essentially the same reason that men and women are separated in 
their personal activities.  

The military's purported "privacy" justification _might_ be 
rationally sound if the policy excluded _all_ gays and lesbians 
from the military. However, this is not what the policy purports to 
do. The new policy purports to permit gays and lesbians to serve in 
the military, but in reality, they are allowed to serve only until such 
time as they reveal their sexual orientation. Consequently, the new 
policy does nothing to allay heterosexual service members' 
personal privacy concerns, given that it envisions the presence of 
homosexuals in the military. _See_ _Able_, 880 F. Supp. at 978; 
_see also_ Posner, R., _Sex and Reason_ at 319 (1992) ("The most 
important reason for doubting that dropping the ban on 
homosexuals in the military would cause serious morale problems 
is simply that a large number of homosexuals already serve 
without significant difficulties.") 

Second, the Federal defendants claim that the policy promotes an 
effective military by preventing "sexual tension." (Fed. Defs.' Mot. 
at 14-15.) The Federal defendants argue that same sex attractions 
within a military unit are "distracting," and therefore, likely to 
disrupt unit cohesion. (_Id_.) As in the case of the privacy 
rationale, the Federal defendants cite to the separation of men and 
women personnel and the fact that "no such accommodation can be 
made for homosexuals." (_Id_.) 

While the prevention of sexual tension and promotion of unit 
cohesion are legitimate goals, the policy does not rationally further 
these interests. As noted, the military's regulations permit 
homosexuals to serve so long as they, in effect, remain celibate and 
conceal their sexual orientation. The "sexual attractions" and 
"tension" which the Federal defendants speculate will result from 
the presence of homosexuals will, therefore, not be curtailed under 
the current policy. Far from promoting unit cohesion, the secrecy 
required under the new policy is likely to foster _increased_ 
tension and suspicion among heterosexuals as well as suffering and 
misery among homosexuals. _See_ _Able_, __880 F. Supp. at 978 
("The only difference will be that heterosexuals will not know 
which of their servicemates are homosexuals, and heterosexuals 
will have reason to have a generalized suspicion of everyone in the 
showers, hardly a circumstance likely to increase 'cohesion.'"). 

Finally, the Federal defendants maintain that the exclusion of 
acknowledged homosexuals is necessary to prevent unit 
polarization. They claim that unit cohesion is a function of "broad 
cultural values, norms, and characteristics that are the result of a 
common socialization process and basic agreement among unit 
members about cultural values." (_See_ Fed. Defs.' Mot. at 16 
(quoting S. Hrg. 103-845 at 249)). They further contend that "when 
this (sic) shared cultural values of unit members breaks (sic) down, 
the result is a loss of unit cohesiveness with often devastating 
consequences." (_Id_.) 

The Federal defendants do not specify the "shared cultural values" 
to which they are referring. Presumably, they mean the "cultural 
values" of heterosexual service members who dislike homosexuals 
or disapprove of homosexuality.[n.~23] The flaw in this argument 
is that service members who are tolerant of the "homosexual 
lifestyle" are not foreclosed from service. Moreover, a service 
member who has "[a]n abstract sexual preference" for the same sex 
-- which _is_ acceptable under the policy -- will no doubt be 
viewed with the same scorn as a homosexual service member who 
"engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, 
or intends to engage in homosexual acts." Stated another way, the 
characteristics which allegedly result in unit polarization -- i.e., 
same-sex preferences -- are shared by both "acceptable" and 
"unacceptable" homosexuals. The Act and Directives simply do 
nothing to further unit cohesion. 

Notwithstanding the rationales articulated by the Federal 
defendants, this Court finds that there is no "conceivable basis" on 
which to find the policy is rational. _See_ _Heller_, 113 S.Ct. at 
2643. The DOD Directives state unequivocally that homosexual 
orientation "is not a bar to continued [military] service . . . ." _See_ 
DOD Directives 1304.14 at 1-9 and 1332.30 at 2-1. Yet, this same 
policy renders the single statement "I am gay" -- _which is nothing 
more than an articulation of what is supposedly permissible_ -- 
sufficient to trigger a presumption that the service member should 
be excluded. _This defies logic_. The inherent incongruity between 
what the policy _says_ and what it _does_ in practice is clear 
evidence that the policy as a whole lacks any semblance of 
rationality. 

4. _The Policy is Irrational As a Matter of Law Because it is Based 
on Private Biases of Others_ 



Entirely aside from the foregoing, even if the Court were to find 
that the policy furthered a legitimate governmental interest, the 
Court finds that the policy fails because it impermissibly relies on 
irrational prejudices against homosexuals as a group. The Supreme 
Court has recognized that a discriminatory classification which is 
based on prejudice or bias is ___irrational_ as a matter of law. 
_See_ _Cleburne_, 473 U.S. at 450 (striking down ordinance 
which was based on an "irrational prejudice against the mentally 
retarded, . . ."). As the Supreme Court recognized in ___Palmore v. 
Sidoti_, 466 U.S. 429, 433 (1984), "The Constitution cannot 
control such prejudices but neither can it tolerate them. Private 
biases may be outside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, 
directly or indirectly, give them effect." __ _Accord_ _United 
States v. City of Hayward_, 36 F.3d 832, 835 (9th Cir. 1994) ("the 
law should not sanction private biases.") (citations omitted), _cert. 
denied_, 116 S.Ct. 65 (1995). Therefore, a discriminatory policy 
against gays and lesbians which is based on prejudice cannot be 
enforced without running afoul of the equal protection clause. 
_Cammermeyer v. Aspin_, 850 F. Supp. 910, 915 __(W.D. Wa. 
1994). 

The governmental interests asserted by the Federal defendants stem 
from the fear and discomfort of some service members which 
results from their _knowledge_ that homosexuals are present. 
However, the concern asserted by the military is simply another 
way of saying that the presence of homosexuals makes some 
service members uncomfortable. While it may be true that some 
intolerant heterosexual service members are uneasy in the presence 
of homosexuals, the Court rejects the notion that the bigotry of 
those service members provides a constitutionally sufficient basis 
to banish an entire class of persons from the military. This is also 
significant because it demonstrates that the purported justifications 
for the new policy stem from and are deeply rooted in hostility and 
prejudice against homosexuals as a group as opposed to any real 
concern with particular conduct. The military's true interest is in 
suppressing expressions of homosexual identity as opposed to 
protecting heterosexual service members' privacy or preventing 
sexual tension. In other words, as long as homosexual service 
members live in a state of secrecy (i.e., "in the closet"), they are 
eligible for service. 

The unit cohesion rationale proffered by the Federal defendants in 
support of the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy is nearly identical to 
the argument which was used by the military to justify the 
exclusion of African-Americans from military service. "For much 
of our history, the military's fear of racial tension kept black 
soldiers separated from whites. As recently as World War II both 
the Army chief of staff and the Secretary of the Navy justified 
racial segregation in the ranks as necessary to maintain efficiency, 
discipline, and morale."____ _Watkins v. United States Army_, 
875 F.2d 699, 729 (9th Cir. 1988) (Norris, J., concurring); _see_ 
_also_ _Buttino v. FBI_, 801 F. Supp. 298, 302 n.5 (N.D. Cal. 
1992); _Cammermeyer_, 850 F. Supp. at 923; _Dahl_, __830 F. 
Supp. at 1330.[n.~24] 

When President Truman courageously issued an Executive Order 
requiring the racial integration of the armed forces in 1948, he did 
so despite almost universal opposition from the military. 
_Watkins_, 875 F.2d at 729 n.32. "Dire consequences were 
predicted for maintaining discipline, building group morale, and 
achieving military organization goals. None of these predictions 
has come true." _Dahl_, 830 F. Supp. at 1330 (quoting a 1988 
study concerning gays commissioned by the DOD); _see_ _also_ 
William N. Eskridge, Jr., _Gaylegal Narratives_, 46 Stanford L. 
Rev. 607, 646 n. 57 (1994) (discussing parallels between 
arguments offered by the military to exclude African-Americans 
and gays). So too it is with the issue of homosexuals serving in the 
military. Once again, the military argues that it is entitled to 
deference in its decision to treat this country's citizens differently, 
not based on the merits of their qualifications or because of what 
they have done, but _because of who they are_. While this Court 
must be deferential to the decisions of the military, that deference 
is not absolute.[n.~25] 

The Federal defendants insist that "the Senate Committee 
specifically rejected the notion that the policy was based on 
irrational stereotypes, . . ." (_See_ Fed. Defs.' Reply at 10.) The 
Court is not so sanguine. The mere fact that Congress has denied 
any discriminatory motive, however, does not foreclose nor relieve 
this Court of its responsibility to assess the constitutionality of a 
given law or directive. _See_ _Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld_, 420 
U.S. 636, 648 (1974) ("the mere recitation of a benign . . . purpose 
is not an automatic shield which protects against any inquiry into 
the actual purpose underlying a statutory scheme."); _Lamprecht v. 
FCC_, 958 F.2d 382, 392 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 1992 ("If a legislature 
could make a statute constitutional simply by 'finding' that black is 
white, or freedom [is] slavery, judicial review would be an 
elaborate farce."). In addition, the Federal defendants' contention is 
highly suspect given the comments of Senator Exon, one of the 
members of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, who stated 
that the Committee was fearful of implementing "an unsatisfactory 
policy and that policy is a policy of open gays in the military, 
which a great number of us have very serious legitimate concern 
about." _See_ S. Hrg. 103-845 at 777. Thus, it is evident that the 
true concern in drafting the policy was the _continued_ 
_exclusion_ of homosexual service members as opposed to the 
proscription of homosexual conduct. 

That some service members may dislike homosexuals, find their 
lifestyle immoral, or are otherwise uneasy in their company is 
_not_ a constitutionally legitimate basis on which to ostracize an 
entire class of Americans from serving in this country's armed 
forces. Like African-Americans, homosexuals should not be barred 
from military service merely because _others_ have irrational 
prejudices (which demonstrate a need for education).[n.~26] 
Moreover, there can be no legitimate, rational basis for a policy 
which forces citizens to lie and conceal their identity, simply to 
accommodate and submit to the bigotry of others.[n.~27]__ While 
the Court acknowledges that the promotion of an effective military 
is a legitimate governmental interest, the Court finds that the new 
policy does not further that interest--and, in fact, severely detracts 
from it. 

At bottom, despite the defendants' assertions to the contrary, _it is 
apparent that the new policy is purposefully directed at excluding 
homosexuals as a group_. The drafters of the new policy have 
merged the concepts of status and conduct in an attempt to 
circumvent the constitutional proscriptions articulated in 
_Meinhold_. The new policy does not penalize service members 
merely for engaging in homosexual conduct--it punishes them for 
simply acknowledging their status. As such, the Court summarily 
adjudicates plaintiff's federal equal protection claim in his favor. 

C. _First Amendment_

Plaintiff's Ninth Claim for Relief alleges that defendants violated 
his rights to free speech and free expression which are protected 
under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. 
_See_ U.S. Const. amd. I. ("Congress shall make no law . . . 
abridging the freedom of speech . . . .") "It is axiomatic that the 
government may not regulate speech based on its substantive 
content or the message it conveys." _Rosenberger v. Rector and 
Visitors of the Univ. of Virginia_, -- U.S. --, 115 S.Ct. 2510, 2516 
(1995). Pure speech, no matter how offensive or controversial, is 
entitled to the highest protection. _______See_ ___Texas v. 
Johnson_, 491 U.S. 397, 414 (1989) ("If there is a bedrock 
principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the 
government may not prohibit expression of an idea simply because 
society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable."). 
"Discrimination against speech because of its message is presumed 
to be unconstitutional." _Rosenberger_, 115 S.Ct. at 2516. 

Although the protections of the First Amendment are generally 
broad, the Supreme Court has cautioned that "[judicial] review of 
military regulations challenged on First Amendment grounds is far 
more deferential than constitutional review of similar laws and 
regulations designed for civilian society." _Goldman_, 475 U.S. at 
507 (holding that First Amendment did not prevent military from 
disallowing an Orthodox Jewish service member from wearing a 
yarmulke). Nevertheless, the military's need for discipline and 
order, which underlies such deference, does "not, of course, render 
entirely nugatory in the military context the guarantees of the First 
Amendment." _Id_. Therefore, in the context of the military, 
regulation of speech based on content survives constitutional 
scrutiny only if it is "no more than [what is] reasonably necessary 
to protect [a] substantial government interest." _Brown v. Glines_, 
444 U.S. 348, 355 (1980). 

Here, there is no legitimate dispute that the Act and Directives are 
content-based, as they target service members who acknowledge 
their homosexuality. _See_ _Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, 
Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston_, 115 S.Ct. 2338, 2346 
(1995); _accord_ _Elzie v. Aspin_, 897 F. Supp. 1, 5 (D.C. Dist. 
1995). Nevertheless, the Federal defendants contend that the new 
policy does not impermissibly infringe on plaintiff's First 
Amendment rights. They argue that the new policy is directed at 
conduct, not speech, and that speech disclosing one's sexual 
orientation justifiably evidences the service member's likelihood of 
engaging in homosexual acts. __The Federal defendants assert that 
under this rationale, the Ninth Circuit has consistently rejected first 
amendment claims brought under the military's former policy. 

These arguments lack merit. __The current policy expressly 
provides that __a service member's "_sexual_ _orientation_ . . . 
_is_ _not_ _a_ _bar_ to service entry or continued service. 
Homosexual conduct, however, _is_ grounds for separation from 
the Military Services." __DOD Directive 1332.30 at 2-1 (emphasis 
added). While a service member's acknowledgement of orientation 
is _necessarily_ evidence that he or she is a homosexual, it is not 
_necessarily_ evidence that the service member is likely to engage 
in proscribed conduct in violation of military law. An 
acknowledgment of sexual orientation is nothing more than a 
verbalization of what the military has expressly stated is 
permissible. To conclude, as the Federal defendants urge, that 
disclosing one's homosexual orientation, in and of itself, has 
evidentiary significance beyond mere confirmation of one's sexual 
orientation would literally render hollow the military's express 
pronouncement -- "a member's sexual orientation . . . is not a bar to 
service entry or continued service." The member's statement of 
status only acquires independent significance by virtue of the 
presumption attached to that statement. As a result of this 
presumption, the statement confirming one's status becomes the 
proscribed "conduct" for which a service member may be 
discharged. _See_ _Able_, 880 F. Supp. at 976 ("under the First 
Amendment a mere statement of homosexual orientation is not 
sufficient proof of intent to commit acts as to justify the initiation 
of discharge proceedings."). 

The Court also finds the Ninth Circuit cases __cited by the Federal 
defendants provide little support for their argument. Unlike this 
case, those cases were all decided under the military's _former_ 
policy which _expressly_ discriminated against homosexuals on 
the basis of their _orientation_. That distinction is significant 
because a statement of "I am gay" _is_ direct evidence of the 
person's sexual _orientation_. _See_ _Pruitt_, 963 F.2d at 1164. 
Since the express purpose of the current policy is to address 
_conduct_ alone, the logic of those cases does not bar plaintiff's 
first amendment claim.__[n.~28] 

The Court concludes that the military's current policy 
discriminating against homosexuals violates plaintiff's rights under 
the First Amendment. The fact that the military attaches severe 
evidentiary significance to a statement of status demonstrates that 
the new policy is directed at _speech_, not conduct. Indeed, 
whether or not the homosexual service member ever actually 
engages in the conduct is, as a practical matter, inconsequential. 
Because the new policy infringes on Lt. Holmes' fundamental right 
to freedom of speech, the Court summarily adjudicates this claim 
in favor of plaintiff.  

D. _Substantive Due Process_

Lt. Holmes' twelfth claim for relief avers that he was discharged 
under the Act and Directives "based on his status as a gay man, 
rather than on the basis of his conduct" in violation of his 
substantive right to due process. (Am. Compl. Paragraph 105.) 
Substantive due process guards against arbitrary and capricious 
governmental action. _Sinaloa Lake Owners Ass'n v. City of Simi 
Valley_, 882 F.2d 1398, 1407 (9th Cir. 1989), _cert. denied_, 494 
U.S. 1016 (1990). "Substantive due process was the doctrine of 
choice for the protection of fundamental rights during the first half 
of this century, although it now has largely been replaced by other 
constitutional doctrines." _Yniguez v. Arizonans for Official 
English_, 69 F.3d 920, 945 n.29 (9th Cir. 1995) (en banc), _cert. 
granted_, 64 U.S.L.W. 3439 (March 25, 1996). 

The rights plaintiff seeks to vindicate through his substantive due 
process claim are duplicative of those asserted in his equal 
protection and first amendment claims. As those constitutional 
provisions more specifically address the rights plaintiff seeks to 
vindicate, the Court concludes that dismissal of plaintiff's 
substantive due process claim is appropriate. _See_ _Graham v. 
Connor_, 490 U.S. 386, 395 (1989) (improper to analyze excessive 
force claim under substantive due process where specific 
constitutional provision applicable); _Armendariz v. Penman_, 75 
F.3d 1311, 1318 (9th Cir. 1996) (finding that "the plaintiff's 
substantive due process claim fails because it is preempted by 
other constitutional claims under the rule of ___Graham_ . . . 

E. ___Remaining Claims_

The defendants move for dismissal of Lt. Holmes' claims that the 
policy violates his right to intimate associations, the policy is 
vague and overbroad, and that the policy violates his right to 
privacy. Plaintiff offers no meaningful response in opposition to 
the dismissal of these claims. Therefore, the Court dismisses 
plaintiff's Tenth, Eleventh and Thirteenth Claims for Relief. 




_CONCLUSION_

Defendants separated Lt. Holmes from the state and federal 
national guards solely because of who he is, and not for anything 
he had done. Despite their stated goal of proscribing homosexual 
conduct while ostensibly permitting homosexuals to serve, the Act 
and Directives target and punish service members who simply 
acknowledge who they are. This is impermissible under our 
Constitution. Accordingly, 

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:

1. Plaintiff's motion to strike the California defendants' untimely 
opposition is GRANTED. 

2. Plaintiff's cross-motion for summary adjudication is GRANTED 
with respect to his federal equal protection and freedom of speech 
claims. Plaintiff's motion is DENIED in all other respects.  

3. The Federal defendants' motion to dismiss is GRANTED with 
respect to plaintiff's federal claims based on vagueness and 
overbreadth, substantive due process, intimate associations, and the 
right to privacy. The Federal defendants' motion is DENIED in all 
other respects.  

4. The California defendants' motion to dismiss is DENIED with 
respect to plaintiff's federal equal protection and freedom of speech 
claims, and is GRANTED in all other respects. Plaintiff's state law 
claims are DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE to plaintiff 
bringing them in the appropriate state forum. 


5. Defendants shall reinstate Lt. Holmes to the CANG and restore 
his federal officer status in the USANG. Defendants are 
permanently enjoined from further proceedings against Lt. Holmes 
based on the Act and Directives as set forth above. 

IT IS SO ORDERED.

DATED: March 29, 1996

U.S.F. L. Rev. 919, 920-21 (1994) (discussing history of the 
military's ban on homosexual service members). 



2. A "_[h]omosexual act_" is defined as "_[a]ny bodily contact_, 
actively undertaken or passively permitted, between members of 
the same sex for the purpose of satisfying sexual desires, and . . . 
[a]ny bodily contact which a reasonable person would understand 
to demonstrate a propensity or intent to engage in an act described . 
added); 10 U.S.C. Section 654(f)(3)(A) & (B) (Supp. 1994). 



3. DOD Directive 1332.14, which applies to enlisted personnel, is 
substantially similar to DOD Directive 1332.30, which applies to 
officers. Since Lt. Holmes was an officer at the time of his 
discharge, the Court's discussion will focus on DOD Directive 
1332.30. 



4. Lt. Holmes has dismissed his claim for procedural due process 
and his damages prayer for back pay. (_See_ Pl.'s Opp'n at 2 n.2.) 



5. In addition to Rule 12(b)(6), the California defendants' cite Rule 
12(e) as a basis for dismissing plaintiff's complaint. However, Rule 
12(e) pertains to a motion for a more definite statement, not a 
motion to dismiss. 



6. The stipulation was signed by Jay Kuo on behalf of the plaintiff, 
Mark Quinlavin on behalf of the Federal defendants, and Andrew 
Loomis on behalf of the California defendants. 



7. Notably, counsel for the Federal defendants experienced no 
difficulty discerning that the cross-motion filed by plaintiff was the 
same motion envisioned in the parties' discussions, (_see_ Kuo 
Decl. in Supp. of Mot. to Strike Paragraphs 3-5), and in the 
stipulated scheduling order, as evidenced by his timely filed 
response. 



8. The California defendants' papers are replete with perjoratives 
and extraneous and derogatory commentary, ostensibly intended to 
deride plaintiff by virtue of his homosexuality. For example, in one 
part of his brief, California defendants' counsel, Mr. Andrew 
Loomis, analogizes homosexuality to "statutory rape, incest, 
sodomy, illicit drug use, possession of child pornography, 
pederasty, bestiality, cannibalism and molesting, etc." (Cal. Defs.' 
Mot. to Dismiss at 17 n.13.) In the reply filed in support of his 
motion to dismiss, Mr. Loomis taunts, "Mr. Holmes, what are 
you?" (Cal. Defs.' Reply in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss at 15 n.20.) 
Finally, defense counsel concludes his "legal argument" by 
asserting, "In sum, Holmes is irked that the Constitution does not 
recognize anything special about his own favorite nasty habits." 
(Cal. Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss at 25.) These are but a _few_ 
examples of the highly unseemly and unprofessional commentary 
which litters the California defendants' briefs. 



9. State officials sued in their official capacity "are considered to 
be acting on behalf of the state, and the Eleventh Amendment 
therefore shields them from suit." _Coeur D'Alene Tribe of Idaho 
v. State of Idaho_, 42 F.3d 1244, 1250 (9th Cir. 1994) (citing 
__cases). 



10. The California defendants also make much of plaintiff's 
admission that he would otherwise engage in homosexual conduct 
but for the policies in place. Far from demonstrating that plaintiff 
intends to engage in proscribed conduct, this statement indicates 
that plaintiff intends to conform his conduct to the military's 
regulations. The fact that plaintiff might act differently if such 
actions were permitted is irrelevant. 



11. The Court expresses no opinion as to whether federal control 
over organization, training, and discipline also depends upon 
Congress' conditional spending program, or whether present 
National Guard policies in these areas flow from the powers 
granted to Congress in the Militia Clauses.  



12. An alternative course of action is to transfer the officer to a 
position that does not require federal recognition, thus preserving 
federal recognition (and therefore, funding) of the officer's former 
unit__. 



13. Like California, Oregon has adopted by statute all applicable 
federal military regulations.__ 



14. Plaintiff invites this Court to revisit the issue of whether 
homosexuals are a suspect class, based on new evidence that 
sexual orientation is genetic and an immutable characteristic. 
(_See_ Pl.'s Opp'n and Cross-Mot. at 8 n.9.) However, as the Court 
finds that the military's current policy lacks any rational basis, the 
Court finds it unnecessary to reach this issue. 



15. The Department of Defense is cognizant of the constitutional 
flaws inherent in a status-based policy. During the Senate hearings, 
Jamie Gorelick, then counsel to the Department of Defense, stated 
during a Senate Committee hearing on the new policy that, "The 
reason we do not discharge people because we believe them to 
have a homosexual orientation is because in 1981 it was 
recognized that if we did have a status-based as opposed to 
conduct-based rule, that it would be vulnerable to the Courts." __S. 
Hrg. 103-845 at 777. 



16. Ms. Gorelick was also quick to emphasize: 



The burden is placed on the service member throughout. And I 
would reiterate what the Secretary said yesterday, which is that is a 
_very high burden_ and _no one has ever done it_. 



S. Hrg. 103-845 at 772.



17. Colonel Timothy E. Naccarato is an officer in the United States 
Army and, at the time his declaration was prepared, was the Chief 
of the United States Army Litigation Division. (Naccarato Decl. 
Paragraph 1.) Colonel John P. Galligan is Colonel Naccarato's 
successor. (Suppl. Galligan Decl. Paragraph 1.) 



18. The _Able_ court explained that the incidents touted by the 
Federal defendants were "aberrations." The court explained: 



In one, the member had said "she thought she might be gay." In 
another, the member had stated "I'm kind of confused about my 
sexual preference." And in the third the member had said he was 
homosexual in what he thought was a confidential session with a 
Navy counselor who tried to make him "comfortable" and as "free 
as possible" so as to get to the "root" of the member's problems. . . 



* * *



These three atypical results are obviously aberrations that cannot 
be taken to show that the Act holds out any realistic opportunity to 
rebut the presumption. 



_Able_, 880 F. Supp. at 976.



19. Counsel for the Federal defendants conceded during oral 
argument that if a service member admitted to having committed 
an act of sodomy, but nevertheless insists that he or she is a 
_hetero_sexual, the presumption is not triggered. (RT at 67:14-23.)  



20. There is no evidence that homosexuals are any less capable of 
controlling their desires than heterosexuals. _See_ 
_Cammermeyer_, 850 F. Supp. at 919. In fact, the _Steffan_ court 
neglected to recognize that homosexuals have a stronger incentive 
than heterosexual service members to refrain from proscribed 
sexual conduct, given the likelihood that it will lead to their 
expulsion from the military. _See_ _id_.; _see_ _also_ 
_Constitutional Law--Equal Protection--D.C. Upholds Military 
Discharge Based On A Statement of Homosexual Orientation--
Steffan v. Perry, 41 F.3d 667 (D.C. Cir. 1994)_, 108 Harv. L. Rev. 
1779, 1782-83 (1995) ("Although the sexual desires of each group 
may be equally strong, the desires of homosexuals for sex is not 
necessarily greater than their desire to retain their positions in the 
military."). "There is no reason to believe that such improper 
behavior, if it occurs, would be more likely to occur because a 
homosexual has admitted his orientation rather than kept it a 
secret." _Able_, 880 F. Supp. at 978. 



21. The Federal defendants' attempt to distinguish _Meinhold_ as 
being decided under the former policy is rather curious in light of 
the DOD's admission that the rebuttable presumption in the new 
policy also existed under the old policy. S. Hrg. 103-845 at 775 
("Senator, the procedure that we have described, this rebuttable 
presumption, has been in the directive since 1981, . . ."). 





22. The Court notes that Federal defendants' claim that the policy 
advances the "privacy interests" of heterosexual service members 
is somewhat curious given that the policy itself recognizes that 
military life is often characterized by "little or no privacy." 10 
U.S.C. Section 654(a)(12). 



23. The essence of this argument is that unit cohesion will suffer 
because certain heterosexual service members dislike 
homosexuals. As set forth _infra_, __the personal prejudices of 
those service members cannot provide constitutional support for an 
otherwise irrational policy. 



24. Such justifications have also historically been used to 
rationalize discriminatory policies. ___E.g._, _Plessy v. Fergeson_, 
163 U.S. 537, 550 (1896) (citing the promotion of the "public 
good" as a basis for upholding the "separate but equal" segregation 
of the races). 



25. The danger of such unchecked deference is clearly 
demonstrated by decisions such as _Korematsu v. United States_, 
323 U.S. 214 (1944), _reh'g denied_, 324 U.S. 885 (1945), which 
upheld the internment of Japanese American citizens in 
concentration camps during World War II. "That decision, justified 
by deference to the military's race-based judgment about the threat 
posed by Japanese Americans, is one of the Court's most 
embarrassing moments, and has been thoroughly repudiated by 
history." D. Cole and W. Eskridge, Jr., _From Hand-Holding to 
Sodomy: First Amendment Protections of Homosexual 
(Expressive) Conduct_, 29 Harvard C.R.-C.L. L.R. 319, 343 
(1994); _see also_ _Hirabayashi v. United States_, 828 F.2d 591, 
593 (9th Cir. 1987) (criticizing military's decision to separate 
Japanese-Americans). 



26. The Bill of Rights is predicated on the notion that the rights of 
the minority must be protected from assault by the majority. 
_Wabol v. Villacrusis_, 958 F.2d 1450, 1462 (9th Cir.), _cert. 
denied sub nom._, 113 S.Ct. 675 (1992) (stating that "bold 
purpose" of the Bill of Rights is "to protect minority rights, not to 
enforce homogeneity."). The "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy 
violates this fundamental notion. By promulgating and seeking to 
enforce the ban on gays from the military, the military is officially 
sanctioning and encouraging homophobia. 



27. By forcing homosexual service members to conceal their 
sexual orientation, the policy actually _undermines_ the 
effectiveness of the military by potentially creating security 
concerns. By requiring homosexuals to live in a state of secrecy 
and constant fear of exposure, the policy creates opportunities for 
blackmail of those service members who wish to remain in service. 
_Cf._, ___Watkins_, 875 F.2d at 731 (Norris, J., concurring) ("It is 
evident . . . that homosexuality poses a special risk of blackmail 
only if a homosexual is secretive about his or her sexual 
orientation.") 



28. The Federal defendants also assert that any infringement on Lt. 
Holmes' first amendment rights is justifiable because homosexual 
conduct impairs military readiness. (_See_ Fed. Defs.' Mot. at 18.) 
However, this argument fails for the reasons previously discussed 
in the context of plaintiff's equal protection claim.

<P>In this Nov. 28, 1995 motion, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) moves for summary judgment on two counts of its complaint against GOPAC, the political action committee that has supported Republican candidates for Congress over the last several years.  </P>

<P>The commission alleges that GOPAC sought to circumvent federal election laws by representing the candidates as primarily interested in local elections. The Memorandum supporting the motion details the relationship between GOPAC and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. The relationship included paying several political consultants to "help Newt think."</P>
 
<P>The aid provided to Gingrich's consultants included travel costs (estimated at $250,000 for 1990) and other expenses. According to an audio tape of a GOPAC meeting, "If Newt decides he's got a Saturday free in Georgia, he wants people a[r]ound him. And GOPAC pays those bills. I mean we pay for them to fly down there. We pay for them to stay at the Buckhead Ritz Carlton."</P>

PLAINTIFF FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION'S 
MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT 
OF ITS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON COUNTS 1 
AND 2  
 
Plaintiff Federal Election Commission ("Commission") submits this 
memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment as to 
Counts 1 and 2. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.  
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
The Commission asks this Court to find that the defendant GOPAC, 
Inc. ("GOPAC"), a partisan political organization, became a federal 
political committee by 1989 when it made expenditures and accepted 
contributions of more than $ 1,000 to influence federal elections./1 
Congress enacted a broad definition of a federal political committee in 
the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended (the "Act"), 2 
U.S.C. Sections 431 et seq., which the Supreme Court narrowed only 
to the extent necessary to avoid First Amendment concerns about issue 
advocacy organizations. See 2 U.S.C. 431 (4). However, GOPAC's 
sole politics, and the Act should be applied broadly to such 
organizations to give full prophylactic effect to its provisions that 
prevent corruption and the appearance of corruption, give voters 
information essential to cast informed votes, and facilitate the 
enforcement of the Act. Because there are no material facts in genuine 
dispute, the Commission is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 
Matsushita Electric Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574 
(1986); Tao v. Freeh, 27 F.3d 635, 638 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (citing 
Andersen v. Liberty Lobby Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 255 (1986)).  
 
II. PRIOR PROCEEDINGS 
 
The Commission alleged that GOPAC should have registered as a 
federal political committee in 1989 because its 1989 national ruling 
titled "Campaign For Fair Elections" contained an electioneering 
message advocating the defeat of all incumbent Democratic members 
of Congress and the election of Republican candidates. GOPAC failed 
to register with the Commission and file required reports from 1989 
until May 1991, when it did register. GOPAC filed a motion to dismiss 
arguing that its sole purpose in the 1989-90 election cycle was the 
election of state legislative candidates (the "farm team"), and that its 
letter could not be considered a federal expenditure because it did not 
expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified 
candidate. This Court denied GOPAC's motion to dismiss holding that 
"[h]ere the controlling relevant question is not whether the 
communication expressly advocates' the election or defeat of such 
candidates for federal office, but whether, at the times in question, the 
organization's major purpose . . . [was l the nomination or election of 
an identified candidate or candidates for federal office." FEC v. 
GOPAC, Inc. ("GOPAC I"), 871 F. Supp. 1466, 1471 (D.D.C. 1994) 
(citation omitted, emphasis and ellipsis in original).  
 
As discussed more fully below in section IV. C., the evidence obtained 
in discovery shows that GOPAC satisfies the most stringent test for 
political committee status. However, the Commission respectfully 
requests that this Court reconsider its initial view of the legal standard 
to be applied in light of the decision in Akins v. FEC, 66 F.3d 348 
(D.C. Cir. 1995), pet. for rehearing filed, requiring deference to the 
Commission's construction of the term "political committee." The 
Court's initial view, if not modified, might permit avowedly partisan 
political groups and individual politicians to sponsor organizations that 
could hide their contributors' identities and their partisan electoral 
activities by artfully avoiding naming a particular federal candidate. 
Such organizations might be able to engage in every other aspect of 
modern federal campaigns -- such as coordinating its communications 
and other activities with the Party's leaders, committees and 
consultants; engaging in and distributing the results of campaign 
research, polling, focus groups; recruiting and training partisan 
political activists; sponsoring candidate forums and other political 
meetings; distributing advertisements and soliciting contributions for 
the election of the Party's candidates, etc. -- everything except making 
contributions to, or expenditures naming, a specific federal candidate. 
Hiding the identity of large contributors to organizations associated 
with elected officials and federal candidates, such as the major national 
political parties, creates the appearance of corruption, prevents voters 
from knowing with whom or what entities a political party or 
politician is associating, and makes enforcement of the Act's other 
provisions unnecessarily difficult. Indeed, this is exactly what GOPAC 
did, and it did it for the avowed purpose of electing a majority of 
Republicans to the United States House of Representatives. GOPAC's 
failure to register and file disclosure reports creates the appearance of 
corruption and has deprived the electorate of information that 
Congress considered essential to the public's electoral decisions. 
Approval of GOPAC's failure to report the source of its funds and 
expenditures would create a black hole in the Act's disclosure scheme, 
hiding contributions for and support of candidates for federal office. 
Because GOPAC was a political committee that sought to influence 
the 1990 congressional elections, the Commission requests that this 
Court find that GOPAC violated the Act by failing to register as a 
political committee and failing to file the required public disclosure 
reports of its 1989-90 election cycle activities.  
 
III. SUMMARY OF FACTS 
 
Defendant GOPAC was and is an avowedly partisan political 
organization that was considered, and has advertised itself as, the 
fourth national Republican committee, working alongside the 
Republican National Committee ("RNC"), National Republican 
Senatorial Committee ("NRSC") and National Republican 
Congressional Committee ("NRCC"). Exh. l; Facts 2, 3, 41-45. As 
clearly stated in its correspondence "GOPAC's mission ... since its 
inception, is to create and disseminate [a doctrine for the Republican 
Party] . . . to elect candidates, capture the U.S. House of 
Representatives and become a governing majority at every level of 
government." Exh. 31 at [2030](emphasis added); Exh. 66 at [5408].2  
 
In 1986, Congressman Gingrich became General Chairman of GOPAC 
and changed its projects to reflect his belief that the "primary problem 
of the Republican Party was ideas, not money." Exh. 23 at 
[Gingrich15]. "[Wle had not been able to win in the '80s despite a 
tremendous amount of resources and . . . we had to rethink where we 
were. We had to rethink what wasn't working." Exh. 23 at 
[Gingrich28]. Gingrich himself had "a lot of ideas" regarding 
campaigns and "wanted to begin to implement them in the field. " Exh. 
19 at [Morgan20] . These included ideas both on how to train 
candidates and on what they should say, specifically how "Republican 
beliefs could be best articulated . . . to be best received." Exh. 20 at 
[Callawayl6].  
 
Gingrich believed that GOPAC "should be the leading research and 
teaching institution for candidates and should try to move [the 
Republican Party] into a more aggressive, positive majority style 
politics." Exh. 23 at [Gingrichl6]. Unlike the RNC and the other two 
Republican Party committees where   Gingrich's ideas might be "too 
controversial," GOPAC could be "as bold as it wanted to, and its 
[only] restriction was whether or not its donors wanted to keep 
donating." Exh. 23 at [Gingrichl6]. It "could be much more focused, 
much more mobile, much more responsive." Exh. 21 at [Riddle104]. 
Gingrich proposed his ideas for re-shaping GOPAC to other 
Republican leaders "[a]nd they were pretty amenable to my idea of 
making it an idea-oriented institution." Exh. 23 at [Gingrich15]. From 
at least 1987 to 1990, GOPAC's sole purpose was to "elect~ 
Republicans at all levels of Government," to make the Republican 
Party the "governing majority at every level of government." Exh. 31 
at [2030]; Exh.19 at [Morgan 15, 165]; Exh. 66 at [5408].  
 
During the 1989-90 election cycle, GOPAC's second largest 
expenditure, $958,723 or 19% of the $5,016,303 in total expenses, was 
for mailings that urged the readers to throw the purportedly corrupt 
incumbent Democratic members of Congress out of office and 
solicited contributions to do so. Facts 285-291. Most of these letters, 
like the "Campaign For Fair Elections" letter attached to the 
Commission's complaint, stated that the nation's problems were caused 
by the Democratic incumbents in Congress and would not be solved 
until there was a majority of Republicans in the United States House of 
Representatives. The letters frequently discussed topical, politically 
charged issues and noted, almost in passing, the need to support 
Republican state legislative candidates to form a "farm team" as a step 
toward eliminating the Democratic majority in the House. Some of the 
mailings focused on specific federal candidates, e.g. the election of 
George Bush as President, the defeat of Speaker Wright, and the 
continuation of Congressman Newt Gingrich's tenure so that he could 
continue opposing the corrupt Democratic incumbents in the House. 
Exh. 30; Exh. 31; Facts 224-247. But almost all these letters, mailed 
into virtually all congressional districts, specifically advocated the 
defeat of the Democratic incumbents in the House and the election of a 
majority of Republicans. Id.  
 
Research and development projects, GOPAC's largest category of 
expenditures, after fundraising, at more than $ 1 million during the 
1989-90 election cycle, were designed to determine how Republican 
candidates could best win elections at all levels of government. Facts 
285-291. The results were distributed widely among Republican 
candidates and committees, with no attempt to restrict recipients to 
state candidates. For example, focus groups were used to determine the 
campaign effectiveness of various national topics and messages. Facts 
88-104. An experiment was conducted to broadcast a conservative 
Republican electoral message directly into hundreds of sites 
simultaneously by television satellite to encourage individuals to 
become conservative political activists. Facts 152- 173.  
 
GOPAC sponsored meetings among the ]Republican Party leadership 
and provided a forum for Republican federal candidates to meet large: 
contributors to Republican causes and candidates -- GOPAC's Charter 
Members -- to discuss national issues. Facts 54, 55, 64, 76-87.  
 
In contrast to GOPAC's protestations in its motion to dismiss that 
GOPAC's sole purpose was the election of a "farm team" consisting of 
state legislators, under Gingrich's leadership, GOPAC ceased making 
large contributions to state candidates and state parties. "In the days 
when Pete [duPont] ran the committee, GOPAC gave money 
wholesale. State Parties and candidates alike were the beneficiaries. 
When Newt came on board in 1986, the focus moved to a bilateral 
support of candidates and support for Newt's vision of the Republican 
Party and America." Exh. 66 at [3792]; Facts 19-23, 33-:37. In fact, 
state candidate contributions became one of GOPAC's lowest spending 
priorities -- behind direct mail, recruiting Charter members, research 
and development projects, and training. GOPAC's cash contributions 
during the 1989-90 election cycle to state candidates totaled only 
$350,975, or 7 percent of expenditures. Facts 285-291. Training costs 
for programs any Republican candidate or activist could attend only 
added another $379,295 or 7.6 percent of total expenditures. Id. To 
induce legislative candidates to attend the sessions and hear GOPAC's 
message, candidates were told they would not be eligible for a 
contribution from GOPAC unless they attended a GOPAC session 
(candidates were not informed about GOPAC's other candidate 
contribution criteria). As Gingrich testified, "[w]e saw our niche as a 
very unique research and development and training kind of 
institution." Exh. 23 at [Gingrich23].  
 
In sum, GOPAC expended funds and sought contributions for political 
projects that would elect Republican candidates to both state and 
federal office, with the primary purpose of electing a majority of 
Republican members of the United States House of Representatives.  
 
IV. ARGUMENT 
 
After this Court's earlier opinion, the D.C. Circuit decided Akins v. 
FEC, 66 F.3d 348 (D.C. Cir. 1995), pet. for rehearing filed, which 
provides additional guidance on construction of the term "political 
committee" and the application of the "major purpose" test under the 
Act. The court held that Congress intended the Act's definition of 
political committee to be read broadly and that the Commission's 
construction must be given deference. The facts in this case do not 
present a Constitutional question sufficient to require the Act to be 
construed more narrowly than the Commission has in its advisory 
opinions.  
 
Like the groups in the advisory opinions discussed below, GOPAC's 
primary, if not exclusive, purpose was admittedly partisan electoral 
politics, and therefore, this Court should find that GOPAC was 
required to register and file reports when it, like the groups in the 
advisory opinions, expended more than $ 1,000 to influence federal 
elections by advocating the election of a specified class of candidates, 
such as all Republicans. Moreover, GOPAC meets the Act's definition 
of political committee in that it both expended more than $ 1,000, and 
solicited more than $ 1,000 in contributions, to influence federal 
elections. This is evident in the "Campaign For Fair Elections" letter 
attached to the Commission's complaint. Accordingly, the Commission 
respectfully requests that this Court reconsider its preliminary ruling 
requiring the Commission to show that GOPAC's major purpose was 
to elect particular federal candidates.  
 
In any event, a review of all of GOPAC's activities during the 1989- 90 
election cycle snows that GOPAC's major purpose was the defeat of 
Democratic congressional candidates and the election of their 
Republican opponents, in particular Congressman Gingrich. Thus, 
even under the Court's unnecessarily narrow preliminary ruling, 
GOPAC was required to register with the Commission as a political 
committee in 1989.  
 
A. The Statutory, Judicial And Regulatory Definition Of The Federal 
Political Committee.  
 
1. The Federal Election Campaign Act's Definition of Political 
Committee.  
 
"Congress addressed broadly the problem of political campaign 
financing" in the Act and "wished to promote full disclosure of 
campaign-oriented spending to insure both the reality and the 
appearance of the purity and openness of the federal election process." 
Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 78 (1976). The Court found the burdens 
on First Amendment activities caused by the Act's disclosure 
requirements were justified by three compelling governmental 
interests:  
 
First, disclosure provides the electorate with information "as to where 
political campaign money comes from and how it is spent by the 
candidate" in order to aid the voters in evaluating those who see+ 
federal office.... Second, disclosure requirements deter actual 
corruption and avoid the appearance of corruption by exposing large 
contributions and expenditures to the light of publicity.... A public 
armed with information about a candidate's most generous supporters 
is better able to detect any post-election favors that may be given in 
return. . . Third, and not least significant, recordkeeping, reporting, and 
disclosure requirements are an essential means of gathering the data 
necessary to detect violations of the [Act.  
 
Id. at 66-68 (footnotes omitted). 
 
The Act defines "political committee" broadly to include "any 
committee, club, association, or other group of persons which receives 
contributions aggregating in excess of $1.000 during a calendar year or 
which makes expenditures aggregating in excess of $1,000 during a 
calendar year." 2 U.S.C. 431 (4)(A). "Contribution" is also defined 
broadly to include  
 
"any gift, subscription, loan, advance or deposit of money or anything 
of value made by any person for the purpose of influencing any 
election for Federal office." 2 U.S.C. 431 (8)(A)(i). Likewise, the term 
"expenditure" includes "an+ purchase, payment, distribution, loan, 
advance or deposit of money or anything of value made by any person 
for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office.'' 2 
U.S.C. 431 (9)(A)(i). The Act requires an organization to "file a 
statement of organization within 10 days after becoming a political 
committee within the meaning of section 431 (4)," 2 U.S.C. 433, and 
thereafter to file periodic reports of its receipts and disbursements with 
the Commission. 2 U.S.C. 434(a). The Act also limits contributions 
that can be made to a political committee. 2 U.S.C. 441a(a); 441b(a).  
 
The Court of Appeals for this Circuit recently held that "the Act has a 
broad definition of political committee; Congress intended to address 
broadly the problem of political campaign financing,' and wanted to 
'promote full disclosure of campaign- oriented spending."' Akins v. 
FEC, 66 F.3d 348, 353 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (citation omitted, emphasis 
added).3 In 1976, the Supreme Court decided that for issue advocacy 
groups the "general requirement that political committees' . . . disclose 
their expenditures could raise . . . vagueness problems, for 'political 
committee' is defined [in the Act] only in terms of amounts of annual 
contributions' and expenditures,' and could be interpreted to reach 
groups engaged in issue discussion." Buckley, 424 U.S. at 79 
(emphasis added). Construing the Act's definition of "political 
committee" to avoid chilling the speech of such issue advocacy 
groups, the Supreme Court concluded that " [t]o fulfill the purposes of 
the Act [political committee] need only encompasses organizations 
that are under the control of a candidate or the major purpose of which 
is the nomination or election of a candidate." Buckley, 424 U.S. at 79. 
See FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens For Life ("MCFL"), 479 U.S. 238, 
252 n.6 (1986); Akins, 66 F.3d at 353; FEC v. Machinists Non-
Partisan Political League ("Machinist Non-Partisan"), 655 F.2d 380, 
391-92 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 897 (1981). The Court 
concluded that "[e]xpenditures of . . . 'political committees' so 
construed can be assumed to fall within the core area sought to be 
addressed by Congress. They are, by definition, campaign related." 
Buckley, 424 U.S. at 79. Thus, an organization whose "major purpose" 
is the election of candidates, as opposed to issue advocacy, is a federal 
political committee under the Act, if it either makes more than $1,000 
in expenditures or receives more than $ 1,000 in contributions "for the 
purpose of influencing any election for Federal office.'' 2 U.S.C. 
431(8)(A)(i) and 431(9)(A)(i).  
 
Contrasting political committees with issue-oriented groups, Buckley 
and MCFL explicitly relied upon concerns about unnecessarily 
burdening the speech of issue advocacy groups in formulating the 
major purpose test. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 79; MCFL, 479 U.S. at 252 
n.6. The Court's test was designed to distinguish between 
organizations whose primary focus is electoral advocacy and 
organizations whose primary focus is on issues that occasionally 
become a point of contention in an electoral campaign. The Court held 
that requiring registration and the filing of financial reports by groups 
devoted to electoral politics was justified by the same compelling 
governmental interests that applied to the historical nomination and 
campaigning functions of traditional political committees and 
committees used by politicians for partisan electoral advantage. 
Applying the statute to groups whose major purpose is electoral 
activity and who spend or receive $1,000 for the purpose of 
influencing federal elections serves this compelling governmental 
interest. This construction of the Act also removes any vagueness 
issues by establishing a clear distinction from the issue, advocacy 
groups that were the object of the Court's vagueness concerns. Thus, 
neither the Supreme Court, the circuit courts, nor the state courts have 
expressed any constitutional vagueness or overbreath concerns about 
federal or state legislation requiring the registration of groups whose 
major purpose is electoral activity.  
 
With respect to the Act, the Court did not distinguish between federal 
and state candidates in formulating the major purpose test because it 
was giving effect to Congress' intent to enact a broad definition of 
"political committee" to the full extent permissible without 
unnecessarily burdening the First Amendment activities of issue-
oriented groups. The distinction between federal and non-federal 
committees is contained not in the "major purpose" test, but in the 
statutory threshold exempting political committees with little federal 
electoral activity. The Act's registration requirements only apply to 
groups meeting the "major purpose test" that also have expended or 
received at least $ 1,000 to influence a federal election. 2 U.S.C. 431 
(4).  
 
GOPAC does not deny that its sole purpose is electoral activity. 
Indeed, it advertises itself as the fourth national Republican Party 
committee; its purpose is not issue discussion but electing Republican 
candidates. Thus, under the Supreme Court's analysis, disclosure of its 
expenditures does not raise the same First Amendment concerns as 
issue-oriented groups "because '[t]hey are, by definition, campaign 
related."' Akins, 66 F.3d at 353 (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 79). 
Accordingly, GOPAC satisfies the definition of a political committee 
in the Act. As discussed below, it should have registered with the 
Commission because, through its "Campaign For Fair Elections" 
solicitation letter in 1989, GOPAC spent more than $1,000, and it 
accepted more than $ 1,000 in contributions, to influence the 1990 
Congressional elections.  
 
2. Requiring GOPAC to Register And File Financial Reports Serves A 
Compelling Governmental Interest.  
 
Considering the compelling governmental interests underlying the 
Act's disclosure requirements, GOPAC's failure to disclose its 
contributions and expenditures was particularly egregious because of 
the magnitude of its activity and the appearance of impropriety caused 
by its secrecy. During the 1989-90 election cycle, GOPAC raised and 
spent more than $5 million. Facts 282-291. In connection with the 
"Campaign For Fair Elections" letter alone, GOPAC expended 
$280,812 to produce and distribute that letter and received $275,710 in 
contributions in response to it. Facts 238-239. Neither the sources of 
those funds nor the use of the contributions has been disclosed to the 
electorate by GOPAC. In addition, GOPAC solicited large 
contributions, at least $ 10,000 a year, from more than 100 of its 
Charter Members. As a result of their contributions, these large 
contributors were able to meet with federal office holders and 
Republican party officials. 5 GOPAC's failure to disclose the use of 
these funds creates just the appearance of corruption the Act was 
designed to avoid and deprives "the electorate [of] information as to 
where political campaign money comes from . . . [required] to aid the 
voters in evaluating those who seek federal office ...." + Buckley, 424 
U.S. at 66-67 (internal citation omitted). "As the Court said of quid pro 
quos for campaign contributions in Buckley v. Valeo, 'the scope of 
such pernicious practices can never be reliably ascertained.' . . . 
Although the record contains only allegations, no smoking gun is 
needed where, as here, the conflict of interest is apparent, the 
likelihood of stealth great, and the legislative purpose prophylactic." 
Blount v. SEC, 61 F.3d 938, 945 (D.C. Cir. 1995).  
 
The appearance of impropriety was acknowledged by GOPAC in an 
internal analysis. "There is no hint of any contributor who gives money 
in return for influence.... Nevertheless, there is concern among some 
that we could be criticized by your friends in the [Democratic 
Congressional Campaign Committee] or in the press with the false 
allegation that those who give large sums of money (12 have given 
over $10,000 in the last year) are doing so to gain special treatment 
from you or the Whip office." Exh. l56 at [287]./6 This is just the sort 
of the appearance of corruption that Buckley and Machinists Non-
Partisan found the Act was properly designed to prevent.  
 
3. The Commission's Interpretation of "Political Committee" Is 
Entitled To Deference By This Court.  
 
The Commission, balancing the concern, identified by Congress and 
the Supreme Court, has interpreted the term "political committee" used 
in the Act in a series of advisory opinions. See 2 U.S.C. Section 437f. 
In Akins, a decision issued after this Court's initial ruling on the 
motion to dismiss, the D.C. Circuit held that the Commission's 
construction of this statutory definition, and in particular its 
application of the "major purpose" test, is entitled to substantial 
deference from the courts. Akins, 66 F.3d at 352. As the Supreme 
Court has stated, "if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to 
the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency's 
answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute." Chevron 
U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 83,', 843 
(1984). Moreover, the Supreme Court has recognized that the 
Commission "is precisely the type of agency to which deference 
should presumptively be afforded." FEC v. Democratic Senatorial 
Campaign Committee, 454 U.S. 27, 37 (1981); Akins, 66 F.3d at 352; 
FEC v. National Republican Senatorial Committee, 966 F.2d 1471, 
1476-78 (D.C. Cir. 1992); Common Cause v. FEC, 842 F.2d 436, 448 
(D.C. Cir. 1988).  
 
In particular, this Circuit has held recently that the Commission's 
construction of the words "political committee" as a "construction of 
its own statute cannot be disturbed if it is a permissible one." See, 66 
F.3d at 352 (citing, Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-45). Accordingly, it is 
now clear that the Commission's construction in its advisory opinions 
regarding organizations that qualify as a federal "political committee" 
is entitled to deference by this Court.  
 
In the advisory opinions described below the Commission has for 
more than a decade, consistently found that groups whose sole purpose 
is to support the election of a category of candidates for office -- such 
as all Republicans -- at any electoral level, becomes a federal political 
committee, and must register and report, if its expenditures to support 
the election of federal candidates exceed $1,000. These advisory 
opinions are, at least, a permissible construction of the definition of 
political committee under the Act, and are well within the 
Commission's area of expertise to determine when the major purpose 
of an organization is electoral politics. Akins, 66 F.3d at 352 ("The 
Commission determined that AIPAC's campaign-related expenditures, 
. . ., were not its major purpose . . .)." It was certainly reasonable, if not 
necessary, for the Commission to conclude that partisan political 
organizations that only exist to urge support for one political group, 
such as "all Republicans" or "conservatives," meet the "major purpose" 
test This specific application of the Act to admittedly partisan political 
groups is consistent with Akins and MCFL, which were concerned 
with a chilling effect on the speech of issue-oriented organizations. 
The Commission's construction of the Act resolves constitutional 
vagueness problems, gives effect to Congress's intent that the statute 
be read broadly, and does not infringe on or chill the speech of the 
issue advocacy groups that concerned the Court in Buckley, 424 U.S. 
at 79 or MCFL, 479 U.S. at 252 n.6. Thus, this Court, under Chevron, 
should not add any additional requirements of its own to the "major 
purpose test," such as requiring that a partisan political organization's 
major purpose be to elect a particular federal candidate, as opposed to 
electoral activity generally.  
 
The Commission's advisory opinions also resolve the issue of whether 
expenditures for a particular federal candidate are required or whether 
any categorical appeals to vote for all Republicans, all Democrats or 
all conservative, running for federal office are enough to satisfy the 
$1,000 expenditure test. The advisory opinions hold that such generic 
advertisements meet the expenditure test. Without referring to the 
advisory opinions, this Court has already held that an expenditure 
urging the election of all Republican candidates is "for the purpose of 
influencing" a federal election under the Act. (GOPAC I, 871 F. Supp. 
at 1470-71.  
 
a. AO 1980-126: Independent Voters For A Republican Victory 
Would Solicit Funds And Purchase Advertisements For All 
Republican Candidates.  
 
In 1980, the Commission found that an individual who established a 
bank account in the name of "Independent Voters for a Republican 
Victory," described "Independent Voters" as a "National Committee," 
solicited contributions by telephone and distributed letters that urged 
voters to "vot[e] for all Republican candidates in the 1980 general 
election" triggered the Act's registration and reporting requirements for 
political committees. + Exh. 44 AO 1980-126, Fed. Election Camp. 
Fin. Guide (CCH) 11 5577 at 10,713. The Commission concluded that 
"the operation of an organization which solicits funds from a broad 
range of persons across the country which funds were used to advocate 
the election of +11 Republican candidates in the 1980 election" made 
the organization a political committee within the meaning of the Act. 
Id. (emphasis added). The Commission found that the individual "held 
out the entity called Independent Voters for a Republican Victory' as 
an on-going organization engaged in the making of expenditures to 
advocate the election of Republican candidates." Id. Therefore, even 
though the individual did not identify particular Republican candidates 
to support, or focus specifically on candidates for federal office, but 
rather supported all Republican candidates as a group in the 1980 
election, which included federal candidates, the individual's 
organization was required to register. Id. at 10,714.  
 
The Commission also found that expending more than $1,000 and 
accepting more than $1,000 in contributions for generic "Republican 
candidates" in the next general election met both of the alternative $ I 
,000 federal political committee tests.  
 
b. AO 1986-38: Individual Would Purchase Advertisements For 
Conservative Candidates.  
 
In 1986, the Commission determined that a radio and television 
advertisement that "urg[ed] viewers and listeners to 'vote on No+u 
mber 4th[,]' and 'send the right people [conservatives] to Washington' 
[was] clearly designed to influence voting in elections for Federal 
office." Exh. 45 AO 1986-38, Fed. Election Camp. Fin. Guide (CCH) 
11 5876 at 11,330. The Commission concluded that payments for the 
proposed advertisements would constitute expenditures for the purpose 
of influencing a Federal election, even though the advertisements did 
not identify a particular candidate. L. The Commission found that the 
cost of these advertisements would count toward the $1,000 threshold 
for reporting expenditures if made by a group. However, because the 
expenditures in this case were made by one individual instead of a 
group, the Commission found that registration was not required. Id. at 
11,330-31.  
 
c. AO 1988-22: San Joaquin Valley Republican Associates Engaged in 
Electoral Activity For All Republicans.  
 
In 1988, the Commission considered whether the San Joaquin Valley 
Republican Associates ("Republican Associates") qualified as a federal 
political committee under the Act. See Exh. 46 AO 1988-22, Fed. 
Election Camp. Fin. Guide (CCH) 11 5932 at 11,465. The Articles of 
Incorporation of the Republican Associates described its "'specific 
purpose' as being 'to help elect more Republicans to office by 
enhancing significantly the visibility of the Republican Party, 
Republican ideas, Republican thought and Republican personalities 
within the San Joaquin Valley of California,"' L. at 11,466. The 
Commission examined whether the four activities proposed by 
Republican Associates (publication and distribution of a newsletter, 
sponsorship of luncheons, sponsorship of debates and operation of a 
"campaign library") constituted contributions or expenditures for the 
purpose of influencing federal elections that would trigger the Act's 
registration and reporting requirements. I+l. at 11,467-70. Given the 
exclusively electoral purpose of the Republican Associates as 
represented by the organization itself, its major purpose was never an 
issue, even though there was no indication the organization's electoral 
activities were primarily focused on federal, rather than state and local, 
elections.  
 
The Commission concluded that the activities described did constitute 
contributions and expenditures that counted against the $1,000 
threshold for qualifying as a political committee. Id. As three 
concurring Commissioners noted, "in determining whether a particular 
group or organization is engaging in activities 'for the purpose of 
influencing any election for Federal office' (2 U.S.C. 431(8)(A)(i), 
(9)(A)(i)),'the Commission relies heavily on the apparent nature and 
purposes of the group itself." Id. at 11,472./7  
 
4. This Court Should Follow Akins And Defer to The Commission's 
Construction Of "Political Committee."  
 
In denying GOPAC's motion to dismiss., this Court relied heavily on 
Machinists Non-Partisan, 655 F.2d at 391-92, to support its holding 
that "if the Commission were able to establish that, at a particular point 
in time before GOPAC registered and began reporting, its major 
objective was, in fact, to elect a particular candidate or particular 
federal candidates, then it should follow that GOPAC was, at that time, 
a political committee obligated to register and report." GOPAC I, 871 
F. Supp. at 1470 (emphasis in original). Citing Bucklev, 424 U.S. at 
79, this Court found that "any payment of $ 1,000 or more by an 
organization whose major purpose has been determined to be the 
nomination or election of an identified candidate for federal office (as 
distinguished from an organization which has some other major 
purpose) is, 'by definition, campaign related' and hence, constitutes an 
'expenditure' by a 'political committee."' GOPAC I, 871 F. Supp. at 14 
70-71 (emphasis in original). This Court concluded that "[h]ere, the 
controlling relevant question is not whether the [Campaign For Fair 
Elections] communication 'expressly advocates' the election or defeat 
of such candidates for federal office, but rather whether, at the times in 
question, the organization's 'major purpose . . . [was] the nomination or 
election' of an identified candidate or candidates for federal office." Id.  
at 1471 (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 79).  
 
In view of the D.C. Circuit's subsequent Akins decision holding that 
courts should give deference to the Commission's construction of the 
term "political committee" under the Act, the Commission respectfully 
requests that this Court reconsider its earlier view and give deference 
to the Commission's advisory opinions. The Commission has found 
that once an organization solely devoted to partisan electoral politics 
spends more than $1,000 for the purpose of influencing a federal 
election or receives contributions in excess of $ 1,000 for the purpose 
of influencing a federal election, the compelling governmental 
interests underlying the Act justify requiring that organization to 
register with the Commission as a federal political committee and file 
periodic reports of its financial activity. This Court should follow the 
Akins precedent by deferring to the Commission's construction of the 
definition of a federal political committee, as described in the advisory 
opinions.  
 
In addition to Chevron deference, this Court should reconsider its 
holding to take into consideration Congress' intent to protect these 
compelling interests by defining political committee as broadly as 
permitted by the First Amendment. As discussed above, the Supreme 
Court's concern was about a potential ambiguity that might burden the 
speech of groups primarily engaged in issue advocacy, rather than 
electoral politics. GOPAC is not one of those organizations; it is an 
avowedly partisan political organization. None of the constitutional 
issues that concerned the Supreme Court apply to purely partisan 
groups. In fact, the Court has held that there are compelling 
governmental interests, including the prevention of corruption and the 
appearance of corruption in the electoral process, that justify the Act's 
"broad definition of political committee," Akins, 66 F.3d at 353, and 
the requirement that such organizations file reports of their "campaign-
oriented spending" with the Commission, Buckley, 424 U.S. at 78, and 
these interests are fully applicable to organizations like GOPAC.  
 
This Court's decision prior to Akins relied heavily on Machinists Non-
Partisan, 655 F.2d at 391-396, but Machinists Non-Partisan was a very 
narrow holding about organizations that are very different in material 
ways from GOPAC. As Akins explained, "[t]his Circuit [in 
Machinists]... adopted a narrow construction to determine whether a 
'draft group,' that is, an organization that seeks to encourage a specific 
candidate to run for office, is a political committee under FECA." 
Akins, 66 F.3d at 354 (citing Machinists, 655 F.2d at 394-96.) That 
decision held that the Act's contribution limits did not apply to a "draft 
group" because such a group, by definition, was only trying to 
convince an individual to run for office. Machinist Non- partisan, 655 
F.2d at 391-92. This stands in contrast with groups like GOPAC, 
which spent large amounts to support and elect candidates of a 
particular party, working in close association with that party's officials 
and its campaign committees. Thus, Machinists Non-Partisan does not 
apply to a partisan organization, like GOPAC, whose activities were 
undertaken for the avowed purpose of supporting the election of the 
Republican Party's candidates.  
 
Moreover, when the Machinists Non-Partisan court examined the 1979 
Amendments to the Act, which "delete[d] any reference to 'supporting 
a candidate or candidates for election to federal office,"' it found that 
the amendment would require that even "'draft' groups file reports as 
political committees." Id. at 395. This disclosure requirement for 
"draft" groups, and more so for admittedly partisan groups like 
GOPAC, is justified by the need to inform the electorate "as to where 
political campaign money comes from" and to deter corruption by 
"exposing large contributions and expenditures to the light of 
publicity." Buckley, 424 U.S. at 66-67.  
 
B. GOPAC And Its "Campaign For Fair Elections" Letter Satisfied 
The Act's Definition Of Political Committee As Construed In The 
Advisory Opinions.  
 
1. GOPAC'S Major Purpose Was The Election Of Republican 
Candidates.  
 
The Act's disclosure requirements were designed to apply specifically 
to organizations like GOPAC whose mission was "to generally support 
Republican candidates and principles at all levels of government." 
GOPAC's Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of its 
Motion to Dismiss at 3. It was registered as a political committee in 
several states. In its "Campaign for Fair Elections" letter, GOPAC 
describes itself as "the Republican committee dedicated to building a 
Republican majority at all levels of government." Exh. 1 at 2. Thus, 
there should be no dispute that during the 1989-90 election cycle 
GOPAC's sole purpose was the election of Republican candidates.  
 
GOPAC's avowed purpose is comparable to the organizations in the 
previously described advisory opinions. GOPAC meets the major 
purpose test in AO 1980-126 where the sole purpose was the election 
of Republican candidates. Similarly, the San Joaquin Valley 
Republican Associates, like GOPAC, distributed literature, sponsored 
meetings and debates, and operated a campaign library -- GOPAC's 
campaign research and distribution of the results obviously was more 
sophisticated than Repub]ican Associates -- and, therefore, both were 
political committees. Exh. 46 AO 1988-22. There is no material 
distinction between the major purpose of GOPAC and the 
organizations in the advisory opinions whose purpose was the election 
of "Republican" candidates across the board To be sure, GOPAC far 
outstripped these groups in its size, sophistication and coordination 
with the Republican Party leadership. But, these factors only enhanced 
GOPAC's effectiveness in accomplishing the major purpose that was 
common to all of these organizations: to influence the election of a 
class of federal and state candidates, such as all "Republican" and/or 
"conservative" candidates in the advisory opinions.  
 
If this Court required GOPAC's major purpose to be "'the nomination 
or election' of an identified candidate or candidates for federal office,'' 
GOPAC I, 871 F. Supp. at 1471 (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 79), it 
would provide an easy avenue for GOPAC and other similar partisan 
political organizations to avoid the Act's disclosure requirements. 
Indeed, GOPAC demonstrated how millions of undisclosed dollars 
could be raised and spent by an organization closely associated with 
party committees and candidates to make valuable polling information 
and other campaign research available to the party's candidates. Such a 
group could even expend millions advocating the election of all 
Democrats or all Republicans and explain why the party's candidates 
should be elected and/or the opposing party's candidates defeated. As 
long as such groups are careful not to identify a particular candidate, 
they may not meet the GOPAC I test for political committee status 
under the Act. It is difficult to believe that this Court contemplated 
such a result in GOPAC I, which would confound Congress' purposes 
of preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption by requiring 
disclo ,ure of such use of campaign funds by political committees. 
Buckley has already held that this is a sufficiently compelling purpose 
to justify necessary First Amendment burdens on such organizations.  
 
2. GOPAC Made Expenditures For The Purpose Of Influencing 
Federal Elections.  
 
GOPAC admits that it was the fourth national Republican Party 
committee, and it spent millions during the 1989-90 election cycle to 
help elect Republicans at all levels of government, particularly to elect 
Republican candidates to the United States House of Representatives. 
A comparison of the expenditures by the political committees 
described in the above-described Commission advisory opinions with 
GOPAC's expenditures, particularly GOPAC's mass mailings, shows a 
remarkable similarity in everything except size and number of 
activities. The advisory opinions specifically relied on the expenditure 
of more than $ 1,000 for communications to vote for all "Republican" 
and all "conservative" ccmdidates to find that the organizations would 
be federal political committees under the Act. In 1989, GOPAC spent 
well in excess of $1,000 to produce and distribute its "Campaign For 
Fair Elections" mailings, which called for the defeat of all Democrats 
and the election of all Republican candidates to the United States 
House of Representatives during the 1990 and 1992 elections. This 
letter was plainly for the purpose of influencing those federal elections. 
Exh. 1.  From June 1989 through August 1990, prior to registering as a 
federal political committee with the Commission, GOPAC distributed 
its "Campaign For Fair Elections" solicitation to the general publiG. 
The "Campaign For Fair Elections" communication included a letter 
from Congressman Newt Gingrich, General Chairman of GOPAC, a 
"CITIZENS VETO" addressed to the "Members of the 101st 
Congress" opposing the ('ongressional mail franking privilege, and a 
separate solicitation for contributions. In the letter, GOPAC describes 
itself as "the Republican committee dedicated to building a Republican 
majority at all levels of government." Exh. 1 at 2.  
 
In relevant part, Congressman Gingrich's letter stated:  
 
"[T]he Democrats in Congress have set themselves up as the highest 
authority in the land -- above the will of the American people who 
elected Ronald Reagan and then George Bush to be their president.  
 
The only way to clean up the mess and restore honesty and decency to 
Congress is to break the Democrats stranglehold on power . . .  
 
* * * 
 
Your VETO is the first step in our two-step plan to gain a Republican 
majority in the House of Representatives by 1992.  
 
The Campaign for Fair Elections is a project of GOPAC, the 
Republican committee dedicated to building a Republican majority at 
all levels of government."  
 
Id. The letter claimed that "[w]ith your help, our Campaign for Fair 
Elections will defeat or seriously weaken a large number of Democrats 
in 1990. And that will give us the momentum we need to sweep in a 
majority of Republicans in 1992 .... Our plan is ambitious. We're 
aiming to overturn a Democrat reign that's lasted 35 years." Id. at 3. In 
conclusion, Congressman Gingrich stated "[w]ith your help, we can 
break the liberal Democrats' iron-grip on the House of Representatives 
and build a new Republican majority." Id. at 4. The solicitation reply 
form addressed to Congressman Gingrich accompanying the letter 
asked the addressee to check a box indicating: "YES! I want to help 
break the Democrats' iron grip on Congress by building a new 
Republican majority in the House of Representatives." Id. at 6 
(emphasis in original).  
 
In the same way that the organizations described in the Commission's 
advisory opinions were federal political committees as a result of 
expenditures on their electoral communications, GOPAC was a federal 
political committee because it expended more than $1,000 to produce 
and distribute its "Campaign for Fair Elections" letters for the purpose 
of influencing a federal election. In its letter, GOPAC held itself out to 
the general public as a national "Republican committee dedicated to 
building a Republican majority at all levels of government." FEC Exh. 
1 at 2. From June 1989 through August 1990, GOPAC distributed, 
through Stephen Winchell and Associates, a direct mail firm, 773,515 
"Campaign for Fair Elections" letters to the general public at a cost of 
$265,291. Facts 239. On June 27, 1990, GOPAC, using its own 
mailing list, distributed an additional 25,227 "Campaign for Fair 
Elections" letters to the general public at a cost of $15,521. Facts 238. 
As in AO 1980-126, where the organization, through its solicitations, 
advocated the election of all Republican candidates in the 1980 
election and in AO 1986-38, where the individual, through 
advertisements, urged voters to support conservative candidates in the 
1986 election, GOPAC, in its' solicitation, urged voters to contribute to 
its "Campaign for Fair Elections" to help "defeat . . . a large number of 
Democrats in [the] 1990" election and "to sweep in a majority of 
Republicans in the 1992" election. FEC Exh. 1 at 3.  
 
As discussed above, the Commission found that funds spent to 
advocate the election of "all Republicans" in the 1980 election, funds 
spent to advocate election of "the conservatives" in the 1986 election, 
and during the administrative proceeding in this case, funds spent 
urging voters to help "defeat . . . Democrats" in the 1990 election and 
elect a "majority of Republicans" in the 1990 and 1992 election 
qualified as expenditures for the purpose of influencing federal 
elections even though particular federal candidates were not identified 
by name.  
 
Therefore, because GOPAC produced and distributed its "Campaign 
for Fair Elections" solicitation at a total cost of $280,812 for the 
purpose of influencing federal elections, GOPAC was required to 
register with the Commission by June 1989. GOPAC, however, did 
not file a statement of organization with the Commission until May 8, 
1991. Accordingly, GOPAC violated 2 U.S.C. 433 by failing to 
register with the Commission in a timely manner. GOPAC also 
violated 2 U.S.C~ 434 by failing to file the required disclosure reports.  
 
3. GOPAC Received Contributions For The Purpose Of Influencing 
Federal Elections.  
 
As noted above, the Act defines a political committee as an 
organization that either makes expenditures or accepts contributions in 
excess of $1,000 for the purpose of influencing Federal elections. 
GOPAC accepted more than $1,000 in contributions: GOPAC's 
"Campaign for Fair Elections" letter solicited contributions for the 
political purpose of helping to elect Republican candidates and defeat 
Democratic incumbent candidates for the United States House of 
Representatives -- GOPAC's "two-step plan to build a Republican 
majority in 1992."  
 
"Our plan is ambitious. We're aiming to overturn a Democrat reign 
that's lasted 35 years.  
 
The time has never been better. The American people have never been 
more ready.  
 
But we're going to need your help to succeed. That's why I'm asking 
you to send in a generous contribution .... which must cover the cost 
of:  
 
-- raising . . . money . . . 
 
-- working to get a response . . . from Congress,  
 
-- conducting the massive publicity campaign . . .  
 
-- and building the cash reserve for our candidates.  
 
* * * 
 
With your help, we can break the liberal Democrats' iron grip on the 
House of Representatives and build a new Republican majority.  
 
Exh. 1 at 3-4. Enclosed with the letter was a "Reply Memorandum" 
addressed to Congressman Newt Gingrich, to be signed by the 
addressee and returned with the contribution. Exh. 1 at 5. The "Reply 
Memorandum" stated:  
 
YES! 
 
I want to help break the Democrat's iron grip on Congress by building 
a new Republican majority in the House of Representatives.  
 
* * * 
 
I am enclosing my contribution, made payable to GOPAC, for $25[,] 
$50[,] $100[,] $500 [,] $ Other[,]"  
 
Exh. 1 at 5 (emphasis in original). 
 
In response to this solicitation, GOPAC received $275,710 in 
contributions. Facts 238- 239. As the "Reply Memorandum" itself 
stated, addressees were asked to take two actions: 1) send 
contributions to GOPAC "to help break the Democrat's iron grip on 
Congress by building a new Republican majority in the House of 
Representatives," and 2) sign a "CITIZENS VETO" to be delivered to 
Congress. Exh. 1 at 5. GOPAC's self professed method for building a 
Republican majority in the House of Representatives included building 
cash reserves for Republican candidates. Money donated to GOPAC 
for the purpose of building a Republican majority in the House is 
plainly a contribution under the Act when it is received. United States 
v. Hankin, 607 F.2d 611, 613 (3d Cir. 1979), regardless of what 
GOPAC actually did with the money later. Contributions received by 
GOPAC in response to its "Campaign for Fair Elections" solicitation 
letter were for the purpose of influencing a federal election. 
Accordingly, because GOPAC received contributions totaling 
$275,710, well in excess of the $1,000 threshold, GOPAC was 
required to register as a federal political committee and report its 
receipts and disbursements to the Commission.  
 
Therefore, because GOPAC accepted contributions in response to its 
"Campaign For Fair Elections" solicitation totaling $275,710 for the 
purpose of influencing federal elections, GOPAC was required to 
register with the Commission by June 1989. Accordingly, GOPAC 
violated 2 U.S.C. 433 by failing to register with the Commission in a 
timely manner, and also violated 2 U.S.C. 434 by failing to file the 
required disclosure reports.  
 
C. Even If The "Major Purpose" Test Required More Than An 
Organization Devoted Solely To Partisan Politics, GOPAC's Actual 
Activities And Public Statements Demonstrate That Its Major Purpose 
Was to Influence Federal Elections.  
 
GOPAC was "one of the four major nationwide or national 
organizations in the Republican Party," Exh. 23 at [Gingrich51], and in 
its letters it called itself a National Republican Committee. See. +, 
Exh. 29 at [2749]. To +GOPAC the concepts of a "Republican 
majority" and recapture of the House of Representatives were 
synonymous: "capturing the House of Representatives" was a 
'+metaphor for a Republican majority . . .; one would know that the 
Republican Party had become a majority party when it controlled the 
majority in the House of Representatives." Exh. 22 at [Eisenach44-45] 
Thus, even if the "major purpose" test required more than an 
organization devoted solely to partisan politics, GOPAC's actual 
expenditures, its public statements, and the support it provided to the 
particularly identified class of Republican candidates for Congress in 
the 1990, all demonstrate that its major purpose was to influence 
federal elections. Even if the strictest construction of the term 
"political committee" were used, GOPAC's focus on named federal 
candidates -- George Bush, James Wright and Newt Gingrich -- clearly 
demonstrates GOPAC's major purpose was to influence federal 
elections.  
 
1. GOPAC's 1989-90 Election Cycle Expenditures.  
 
The vast majority, approximately 85 percent, of GOPAC's 1989-90 
expenditures were for the purpose of electing Republican candidates to 
the United States House of Representatives. Letters, such as the 
"Campaign For Fair Elections," were sent almost every month across 
the nation explaining why, in GOPAC's view, it was imperative to 
elect Republican candidates to the House. Research was conducted and 
the results disseminated to Republican candidates and activists about 
the best campaign themes and how to present those themes. 
Congressman Gingrich used this information himself; he signed most 
of the letters including the "Campaign For Fair Elections" letters; and 
he received more than $ 100,000 in contributions to his 1990 
congressional campaign committee from GOPAC's Large contributors. 
These activities to influence the elections of the particular Republican 
House candidates, and Congressman Gingrich in particular, 
demonstrate that GOPAC's major purpose was to influence particular 
federal elections.  
 
Admittedly, much of the research and some of the letters would benefit 
Republican candidates at every level. However, the research was based 
on national issues and concerns rather than those at issue in particular 
state legislative races, and one of the goals of GOPAC's training 
program (approximately 7.5% of expenditures) was to teach candidates 
how to modify their own campaign message to take advantage of the 
national research, and at the same time to campaign on GOPAC's 
national themes. In short, GOPAC's goal was to nationalize local 
campaigns. While it is not possible to allocate GOPAC's expenditures 
among specific election campaigns during the 1989-90 electoral cycle 
+with an accountant's certainty, the obvious purpose for GOPAC's 
development of an election agenda focusing on national concerns was 
the election of Republican congressional candidates. In fact, that is 
exactly what GOPAC told potential contributors in its "Campaign For 
Fair Elections" and other letters.  
 
a. Coordination With the Republican National Committee And The 
National Republican Congressional Committee.  
 
During 1989-90, General Chairman Gingrich was in the Republican 
House leadership, while Executive Director Riddle was the Vice Chair 
of the RNC executive committee. Fact 30. After consultation with the 
RNC and the National Republican Congressional Committee 
("NRCC"),/9 GOPAC expended funds to develop campaign messages 
that could be used by Republican candidates for the state legislative 
and for the Congress. Facts 59-66. The topics of the election messages 
were selected based on their usefulness and expected ability to attract 
voters to Republican candidates nationwide. Id. Once the wording was 
perfected to have the greatest impact on voters, Gingrich incorporated 
them into speeches which were taped and distributed to thousands of 
Republican incumbents, activists and anyone else who requested them. 
Fact 72. GOPAC regularly mailed thousands of audio tapes containing 
the same information and messages to everyone on its mailing list. 
Facts 134-147. In addition, GOPAC also produced videotapes of 
Gingrich and others, which were shown at GOPAC training sessions 
and provided to other candidates and to anyone else who requested 
them. Facts 125-133. After notification to the RNC and the NRCC, 
these messages were taught to national and state Republican 
candidates and activists at state party-sponsored and NRCC-sponsored 
classes. Id.  
 
Campaign research, development and dissemination of winning 
messages began as a "team effort" involving the Republican National 
Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee, "a lot 
of different people." Exh. 23 at [Gingrich34]. "[T]here were meetings 
where people would get together and say, 'All right, where are we 
going and what are we trying to do as a team?"' Exh. 23 at 
[Gingrich68]. In January 1989, Congressman Gingrich, GOPAC 
Chairman Callaway, Executive Director Riddle and GOPAC's 
consultants "had several discussions . . . actually to begin planning for 
the 1992 [congressional] elections." Exh. 22 at [Eisenach41]. 
GOPAC's senior officials had "conclude[d] that 1992 was an election 
in which there would be unique opportunities for Republicans . . . in 
the U.S. House of Representatives." Exh. 22 at [Eisenach1-10].  
 
On February 10-11, 1989, GOPAC sponsored a meeting in 
Washington, D.C. where a "number of conservative and Republican 
and intellectual leaders," essentially a "national leadership group," 
spent two days discussing "how to make the Republican Party a 
majority party." Exh. 22 at [Eisenach38, 43]. One of the topics 
discussed was Republican capture of the U.S. House of 
Representatives. Gingrich and the others wanted "to begin a 
'revolution' that will end in Republican control of the House." Exh. 66 
at [4369].  
 
In August 1989, GOPAC sponsored a two week meeting in a remote 
part of Colorado, the first North Pole Basin meeting. Facts 76-87. 
Attendees were the Republican Party leadership, including the NRCC 
leadership and the most active GOPAC Charter members. Id. The 
meeting was an "effort to go from the general to the specific." Exh. 22 
at [Eisenach91]. "It began with an effort to understand at the very 
broadest level +what the nature really of the world at that time was and 
then proceeded [to] become more specific to end up with the 
discussion of what GOPAC's role should be and what specific projects 
GOPAC should undertake." Exh. 22 at [Eisenach91].  
 
At the first of four parts of the meeting, [Gingrich and GOPAC senior 
staff, along with "big thinkers," "visionary Republican strategists," 
"[m]embers of Congress and political consultants," Exh. 22 at 
[Eisenach89-91], discussed the "structure of the Republican Party 
nationally" and GOPAC's plans. Exh. 19 at Morgan 134]. During the 
second session, attended by Co-Chair of the NRCC Ed Rollins, NRCC 
:Executive Director Marc Nuttle and NRCC Director of Finance and 
Administration Wyatt Stewart, as well as Joe Gaylord who represented 
NRCC's American Campaign Academy, Exh. 66 at [:3593, 3726, 
3728-3729], the participants "focused on the 1990 and 1992 
Congressional elections." Exh. 66 at [3838]. The participants 
"developed a set of campaign themes for 1990." Exh . 66 at [3579, 
3839]. The third session, entitled "Congressional Planning," in turn 
"concentrated on developing key platform planks for the 1990 and 
1992 elections," including a "100-Day Agenda." Exh. 66 at [3675; 
3839]. This session was attended by then Republican House Whip 
Gingrich, Deputy Whip Joe Barton and Republican Congressmen Jon 
Kyl and Bob Walker. Exh. 30 at [2737]. More than half of the 
participants were current or former members of Congress or their 
spouses. Exh. 66 at [3727].  
 
During the fourth session, the "majority of our discussion was focused 
on what specific things GOPAC can do to substantially speed up 
political realignment." Exh.66 at [3840]. Gingrich and the GOPAC 
Charter Members discussed focusing GOPAC's efforts on five areas: 
"research and development;" "product development;" "training;" 
consulting; and "legislative and local races." Exh. 35 at 14. According 
to Gingrich, the first four were "universal" in that they would be 
available to "any Republican or Republican group or Republican 
institution or Republican candidate who would like our help with the 
top four" and would "enhance their ability to do anything at whatever 
level they happen to be at from down to the President, down to the 
Federal Government to the State level to the local level." Exh. 35 at 
14-15. The fifth area of GOPAC activities, direct contributions to state 
parties and candidates (later described as "traditional GOPAC" or the 
"farm team"), now was of only secondary importance. Exh. 35 at 16. 
Because GOPAC believed it was important that all Republican 
candidates espouse the same message that GOPAC had researched and 
disseminated, as one Charter Member candidly put it, contributions to 
state candidates were "the tribute we pay to state parties to let us be 
friendly." Exh. 35 at 16 ("the money is only important because the 
state party likes it," Id.; it makes it easier to attract attendance to 
training sessions). Facts 113.  
 
As GOPAC later explained, "we rethought our mission and expanded 
it to meet the new challenges of the 1990 ' s . . . We are now the 
creator and disseminator of the new republican doctrine. Our extended 
mission will take GOPAC into the exciting new decade of the '90s." 
Exh. 66 at [3850]. GOPAC embarked on what Congressman Gingrich 
later described as "by far the largest and most encompassing recruiting, 
training and funding effort ever attempted by any group." Exh. 66 at 
[4796].  
 
It is noteworthy that these were national meetings involving national 
Republican party leaders discussing national issues to be used by 
Republican candidates for federal office.  
 
b. Research and Development Projects. 
 
During 1989 and 1990 GOPAC took the lead in planning, research and 
development for the entire Republican Party. As Callaway stated, "[i]t 
is my conviction that GOPAC continues to be the Bell Laboratories of 
the Republican Party." Exh. 66 at [4580, 4588, 4612]. GOPAC 
conducted "research and development" to choose and test "issues and 
strategies" to "help Republicans win in the coming election." Exh. 66 
at [4610]. "[W]e are doing issue research to help our candidates 
articulate a winning message for 1990." Exh. 66 at [4575]. Gingrich 
discussed these issues with many people, essentially "whoever's 
judgment I trusted that year." Exh. 23 at [Gingrich20]. By 1990, 
GOPAC was one of the Republican Party's leading planning, research 
and training entities. Exh. 31 at [2786]. Gingrich "believe[d] GOPAC 
is an extremely effective tool for advancing our cause. We not only 
train, fund, and recruit Republican candidates to run for Congress, we 
also shape and guide the language and the issues which the Republican 
Party should address [sic]." Exh 66 at [4278-4279; 4282]. In his view, 
GOPAC was "quite literally[] changing the face of American Politics." 
Exh. 66 at [6099-6102]. During the 1989-90 election cycle, GOPAC 
spent approximately $1 million on these projects to develop the 
winning message for Republican candidates for state and federal 
office.  
 
GOPAC's research revealed "[t]hat there was a natural cultural 
majority that we were failing to reach and that we had to redesign the 
campaigns to fit more accurately a broad cultural majority." Exh. 22 at 
[Gingrich38]. GOPAC therefore recommended that candidates use a 
"thematic approach which allows all of the campaigns to be able to 
subsume themselves into a larger pattern so that . . . you create an echo 
effect, a resonance, which fits about 88 percent of the country." Exh. 
23 at [Gingrich38]. "[I]f you get every straight Republican voter to 
show up, it helps everybody at every level vote and win." Exh. 23 at 
[Gingrich69]. Thus, GOPAC's research developed one of GOPAC's 
campaign tactics, to nationalize state and congressional elections. This 
campaign tactic is mirrored in GOPAC's own national mailings such as 
the "Campaign For Fair Elections" and others described below.  
 
GOPAC also sponsored research "to help our candidates articulate a 
winning message for 1990." Exh. 66 at [4610]. Like other results of 
GOPAC's research and development efforts, the development and 
dissemination of a common national "agenda," on which all 
Republican state and congressional candidates should run, became part 
of GOPAC's political activities. Congressman Gingrich gave speeches 
urging Republican candidates to run on a common agenda and "gave 
them some examples of things that we know are universal," such as a 
balanced budget and crime. Exh. 23 at [Gingrich48-49]. In fact, 
creation and dissemination of a "broad, national doctrine and an 
'Agenda Worth Voting For"' became one of the stated goals for 
GOPAC. "Our focus in 1990 will be to create the 'Agenda Worth 
Voting For' and to help candidates articulate this message." Exh. 66 at 
[4802-4803].  
 
"GOPAC conducted a wide variety of research activities . . ., all of 
them in order to gain a better understanding of public opinion, the 
history, contemporary history, the major forces that work on society 
and the opportunities and challenges that those things presented to the 
Republican Party, not as an institution but as a community." Exh. 22 at 
[Eisenach40]. All of this research into "political issues of the day" was 
"part of GOPAC's overall effort . . . to make the Republican Party a 
majority party." Exh. 22 at [Eisenach60]. GOPAC would know it had 
accomplished that goal when Republicans were in the majority in the 
House. Exh. 22 at [Eisenach40, 108].  
 
i. Expenditures For Campaign Consultants.  
 
GOPAC held many meetings in its own conference room with 
consultants who provided campaign research and theories about the 
best electoral message for Republican candidates for Congress. Paid 
political consultants and literally "hundreds" of volunteers provided 
input. "[I]t was like a revolving door." Exh. 21 at [Riddlel 8]. For 
example, at a June 1989 "long-range planning" meeting, Gingrich and 
other GOPAC officials and consultants discussed a "three-year plan 
designed to ensure that a governing center-right coalition [was] in 
control of Congress and the Executive Branch by 1992." Exh. 66 at 
[4007]. The group concluded that "Republicans [would] need to 
emerge from the 1992 elections with 56 Senate seats, 240 House seats, 
the Presidency, and victories in the corresponding state and local races. 
Newt must be reelected. A given measure of success in 1990 is a 
subgoal of this objective." Id.  
 
The results of GOPAC's planning and strategy sessions, shirt sleeve 
sessions where Charter Members were invited, and the political 
research and development reports from its consultants were widely 
distributed. Facts. 45-47, 59-67. Incumbent members of Congress who 
were running for re-election in 1990, including Gingrich, often 
attended GOPAC meetings where GOPAC's research results and 
future research projects were discussed. National Republican Party 
officials and consultants also were routinely informed of, and 
frequently participated in, GOPAC's activities. Id. In fact, during this 
time period "[i]t was almost standard operating procedure," Exh. 22 at 
[Eisenach34], to tape-record GOPAC meetings and written summaries 
often were prepared. "Whoever had been at the meetings would 
typically get a summary" and "[t]here were many cases in which 
people who did not attend meetings were provided copies of notes 
from those meetings." Exh. 22 at [Eisenach32].  
 
Input from these campaign consultants provided the steering 
mechanism for the rest of GOPAC's activities. Jeffrey Eisenach, Eddie 
Mahe, Steve Hanser, Ed Rollins, Joseph Gaylord and many others 
provided advice on national trends and how to bring about a 
Republican majority in the House.  
 
ii. Expenditures For Focus Groups. 
 
GOPAC paid for research using focus groups around the country to 
test topics and messages to be used by Republican candidates, 
including congressional candidates in the 1990 election. In 1989, 
GOPAC conducted eight focus groups in four cities in an attempt to 
"validat[e] the proposition that education choice was a potentially 
useful issue for Republican candidates. * * * Useful . . . in the course 
of explaining a set of views and building a political platform." Exh.22 
at [Eisenach59]. GOPAC was "trying to divine national implications, 
which is to say the ability to make statements about the issue which are 
applicable in various regions of the country." Exh. 22 at [Eisenach61]. 
A written "manual," Exh. 66 at [3849], and video tape excerpts, Exh. 
21 at [Riddle51-52,55], were distributed "very broadly, including to 
the press and the national media so it was made available to the 
world." Exh. 22 at [Eisenach62]. "It essentially was distributed to the 
general public, which includes Federal officeholders." Exh. 22 at 
[Eisenach63].  
 
Another GOPAC focus group project was the "most extensive focus 
group research project conducted by the Republican Party in recent 
years," Exh. 66 at [3885, 3935], to determine what people who had 
become "self-disenfranchized from the political process" -- "who had 
chosen not to register to vote or had registered to vote but had failed to 
vote in two or three preceding elections" -- thought and "what needed 
to be done to re-engage them in the political process." Exh. 19 at 
[Morgan128]. The purpose of the study was to "determin[e] ways to 
ensure that young adults (who associate strongly with the GOP) are 
motivated to vote for Republican candidates." Exh. 31 at [2784] 
(emphasis in original). Specifically, the focus groups sought to identify 
"specific proposals of change (our products)" and "specific examples 
of the obstacles to change from left-wing values and the bureaucratic 
welfare state . . . (their anger points)" which would motivate them to 
vote for the Republican Party, and " [h]ow can we package all this?" 
Exh. 66 at [401]. "The goal [wa]s to find the six best proposals, the six 
best critiques, and the best worked generic argument and package for 
an American Opportunities Agenda." Id. This included tests of specific 
slogans. Exh. 66 at [405]. Eighteen focus groups were conducted in 
nine cities throughout the country. Exh. 66 at [3935]. "We literally 
tested language and ideas that we believe[d] will help us better 
communicate with voters and will help candidates articulate the values 
of Americans who are neither Democrat nor Republican." Exh. 66 at 
[3792].  
 
An "extensive" 200 page report was produced on GOPAC's national 
focus groups, "including transcripts [and] verbatim quotations." Exh. 
22 at [Eisenach81]. The report "identified language and ideas that 
would motivate young people to become active in the political process 
and encourage them to vote Republican." Exh. 66 at [3885]. It was 
"widely disseminated to Republican Party and Congressional leaders, 
as well as key cabinet officials." Exh. 31 at [2784], Exh. 66 at [3930].  
 
In fact, GOPAC's Finance Director wrote that "[t]he focus group 
project is a difficult product to describe and/or defend. However, ] do 
think it is important to remember that Newt has used that research in 
countless speeches and we produced a series of training tapes for 
candidates using information gleaned from those groups. * * * I am 
told that the next generation of tapes and videos . . . also incorporate[s] 
this research." Exh. 66 at [3792] (ellipses in original).  
 
iii. Expenditures To Develop The "Agenda Worth Voting For".  
 
As described above, GOPAC's consultants and research projects 
indicated that there would be a campaign advantage if the Republican 
congressional candidates all campaigned on the same basic issues that 
could be reinforced in the voters' minds if the state legislative 
candidates echoed the same themes. Therefore, by at least 1989, 
GOPAC began developing a " 100-day agenda" of campaign proposals 
that would be used as the basis of congressional campaigns and 
enacted by a Republican controlled House. Exh. 66 at [3578]. This 
agenda was later described as "a series of sweeping legislative 
initiatives put forth as a gentleman's agreement between the 
Republican Party and the American people regarding how G.O.P. 
leaders propose to govern given the control of the House of 
Representatives and Administration ...." Exh. 66 at [3502]. This 
"agenda" later evolved into the "Contract With America." Fact 73.  
 
"GOPAC believes that these reforms are desirable but that their 
adoption depends on whether they can pass the test of American 
democracy -- i.e, whether they can win the support of the electorate at 
the local, state and Federal levels. Electoral support, in turn, depends 
on the ability to describe why reform is needed, what general 
principles should be followed and why specific proposals are desirable 
in a way that enlists support by average citizens, activists, opinion 
leaders and, ultimately, elected officials. Furthermore, GOPAC 
believes that the success of these particular ideas depends on whether 
they can attract support from outside the current set of political 
participants, i.e., whether they can be molded into an "agenda worth 
voting for" that would attract current non-voters to the polls."  
 
Exh. 66 at [393]. Of course, this "agenda" of legislative proposals was 
selected based on their national appeal and usefulness for Republican 
congressional candidates to be only enacted by a Congress controlled 
by Republicans. The primary purpose for the development was to 
influence the congressional races in 1990. It was refined. and used in 
the subsequent two federal elections.  
 
iv. Expenditures For A Satellite Broadcast Experiment.  
 
GOPAC also experimented with disseminating its political message 
directly to a national audience by interactive satellite television, testing 
its view "about how powerful it would be to be able to put interactive 
grassroots political training workshops on television accessible to 
anybody who could hook up to a satellite . . ., how much bigger we 
could make the political movement in the country and how many more 
citizens [we could] activate." Exh. 19 at [Morgan117]. Thus, GOPAC 
produced the "American Opportunities Workshop," Exh. 19 at 
[Morgan117-118]; Exh. 21 at [Riddle57,130], a May l9, 1990 
television program broadcast by satellite from Newman, Georgia to 
655 remote sites. Four of the remote sites were fully interactive; they 
could both send and receive a television signal. Altogether, more than 
40,000 people participated at the host and remote sites, and an 
estimated television audience of 250,000 watched the broadcast. Exh. 
66 at [3926]. GOPAC believed it was the "largest satellite network 
ever put together." Exh. 66 at [3885]./10 In addition, the program was 
broadcast to the general public on The Family Channel, "one of 
America's largest cable networks," Exh. 66 at [3931], which was 
received in more than half of the homes in America.  
 
According to Congressman Gingrich, it "literally [was] an experiment 
to see if we were at the state of the art where a nationwide delivery by 
downlink was competitive with tapes as a way of communicating ideas 
and generating interest." Exh. 23 at [Gingrich45]. "It was an unusual 
R&D project." Exh. 22 at [Eisenach46]. Thus, as GOPAC Chairman 
Callaway described the workshop, it was "in every way, consistent 
with all that GOPAC wishes to accomplish. The workshop will be a 
method through which we will be able to reach more candidates and 
incumbents than ever before and provide them with the same winning 
messages and themes that has [sic] proven successful for our present 
farm team members." Exh. 66 at [465, 3787, 3797]. "Our May 19 
project will go a long way toward helping Republicans set an agenda 
and persuading Americans to realign with us." Exh. 66 at [4561+462; 
4574]. As GOPAC Finance Director described it, " [w]e are launching 
the 'movement' a la Newt on May 19." Exh. 66 at [4633].  
 
The program provided both national and local exposure for Gingrich, 
who together with a professional broadcaster, was one of the two 
principal hosts. Gingrich was selected because of "his role as chairman 
of GOPAC and as someone who effectively portrays, arguably more 
effectively than any other national leader, a set of ideas and issues that 
we were attempting to convey." Exh. 22 at [Eisenach75]. Of course, 
this was the same agenda that GOPAC's research already had shown to 
be advantageous in Republican congressional campaigns.  
 
c. GOPAC Video And Audio Tape Program. 
 
During the 1989-90 election cycle, GOPAC mailed to potential federal 
and state Republican candidates tape recordings of speeches by Newt 
Gingrich and other national Republican leaders. Facts 125-151. The 
purpose of this tape program was to provide campaign topics and 
messages that all Republican candidates should use in their campaigns. 
Facts 148-149. During 1989 GOPAC adopted a formal "Mission 
Statement" reflecting its expanded objectives: "GOPAC's mission for 
the 1990s is to create and disseminate the doctrine which defines a 
caring, humanitarian reform Republican Party in such a way as to elect 
candidates, capture the U.S. House of Representatives and become a 
governing majority at every level of Government." Exh. 66 at [281-
282; 3847]. Contemporaneous documents describe as one of GOPAC's 
goals the creation and execution of "fundamentally and essentially a 
COMMUNICATIONS PLAN." Exh. 66 at [3.583] (emphasis in 
original). "Because we don't control the news media . . ., we must 
create our own propaganda machine for the widespread distribution of 
broadcast, print and computer communications to supply our activists 
and potential followers with ideas, information and rhetoric." Exh. 66 
at [3583]. As Gingrich explained, "[t]he Republican Party must 
become the vehicle for this reform movement. Training Republican 
activists in the new language and doctrine needed as the vehicle for 
reform must be one of our highest priorities." Exh. 66 at [383'3].  
 
Since GOPAC believed that "[o]nly a national mobilization of popular 
will [would] dislodge the Democratic machine in the House," GOPAC 
concluded that it was essential to create a sense of public "rage by 
proving there is a corrupt liberal welfare state sustained and protected 
by a selfish, entrenched Democratic machine." Exh. 66 at [4021-22]. 
As part of this effort, during 1989 GOPAC distributed video +apes of a 
speech by Congressman Gingrich entitled "Challenge to Reform." 
Exh. 66 at [3849]. This tape was "used in advance activist seminars 
and incumbency seminars to help frame thinking on creating a new 
doctrine for the 90s." Exh. 66 at [3849]. In addition, GOPAC initiated 
an "intensive national direct mail effort . . . pushing the agenda of 
congressional reform." Exh. 66 at [3850]. These letters accused 
incumbent Democratic Representatives of abuse of power and 
corruption, and specifically attacking the integrity of then-Speaker 
Wright. [Sic]  
 
Accordingly, GOPAC mailed video and audio tapes to incumbent state 
legislators, potential candidates who attended GOPAC seminars, and 
anyone else who requested them to provide common campaign themes 
and messages. Facts 138-147. This included the American Campaign 
Academy, a separate training organization whose sole source of 
funding was the National Congressional Campaign Trust, an affiliate 
of the NRCC. Facts 128. GOPAC also mailed audio tapes "on a more 
or less monthly basis . . ., typically less" to everyone in GOPAC's 
database, between 5,000 and 10,000 people at various times. Exh. 22 
at [Eisenach99]. During 1989, GOPAC mailed more than 45,000 
copies of nine new cassette tapes. Exh. 66 at [3848]. During 1990 
GOPAC mailed 36,000 copies of six new audio tapes to legislators, 
candidates, activists and others. Exh. 31 at [2031, 2784],1 Exh. 66 at 
[3885 3905-3906, 3919]. GOPAC's Political Director Thomas Morgan 
testified it was likely there were federal candidates on GOPAC's 
mailing list. Exh. 19 at [Morgan162-163]. In addition, copies of audio 
tapes were routinely mailed to all members of the RNC, and both the 
chairman and executive director of each Republican state party. Facts 
143.  
 
GOPAC's tapes provided candidates and activists with a "replacement 
language with which we will be able to more accurately describe our 
optimistic and hopeful outlook of the future." Exh. 31 at [2030]. By 
providing common campaign themes from the "Agenda Worth Voting 
For" (based on advice from GOPAC's consultants and its own research 
and development) to Republican candidates, GOPAC's tape programs 
created a unified "national agenda"; they "got Republicans . . . talking 
the same language nationwide." Exh. 19 at [Morgan76; 4802]. Many 
of these tapes were of Gingrich's speeches espousing the campaign 
themes from the "Agenda Worth Voting For." For example, "[i]f 
everyone in Alabama was using the same kind of language and talking 
at the same level and developing the same kind of concepts for 
governing, then that strengthened the whole Republican effort across 
the board and therefore created a synergistic output that helped our 
candidates." Id.  
 
Because the training and tapes were so effective, no other coordination 
with candidates was necessary. Exh. 21 at [Riddle47]. "Imagine 
thousands of Republican candidates and activists driving to work, to 
meetings, to campaign events, even on vacation, all listening to the 
most recent audio tape from GOPAC -- all of these people getting a 
personal lesson in the latest message or campaign technique from 
GOPAC." Exh. 66 at [3919]. As GOPAC stated in its 1989 annual 
report to its Charter Members, " [t]he impact of that broad 
dissemination of message cannot be measured!" Exh. 66 at [3848].  
 
d. GOPAC State Candidate Contributions and Training.  
 
As described above, GOPAC spent approximately 15 percent of its 
expenditures during the 1989-90 election cycle directly on state 
candidate cash contributions and training. It did so as an enticement to 
state candidates to use GOPAC's national campaign "agenda" in the 
hope that all Republican candidates would proclaim the same message. 
This, in GOPAC's theory, would increase the number of Republican 
state legislative and members of the United States House of 
Representatives.  
 
During 1989, "GOPAC began to include segments on creating an 
agenda worth voting for." Exh. 66 at [385-6]. "Our training filled a gap 
in the way Republicans trained candidates. * * * GOPAC training is 
now used as the foundation for most national level Republican 
political seminars." . Exh. 66 at [3856, 3857]. No steps were taken to 
limit attendance and GOPAC's political director, who conducted many 
of the sessions, is "sure" that occasionally some congressional 
candidates and/or some of their campaign managers attended. Exh. 19 
at [Morgan52]. In addition, GOPAC's Political Director Tom Morgan 
became a "regular teacher at the [NRCC's] American Campaign 
Academy[,] where the best and brightest campaign managers are 
trained." Exh. 66 at [3857].  
 
Even GOPAC's cash contributions to state candidates were part of 
GOPAC's goal to elect a majority of the House. GOPAC targeted 
particular congressional districts./11 During 1988, GOPAC had a 
"hard line rule" that it would only contribute to legislative candidates 
who "live[d] in a district represented by a Democrat in Congress." 
Exh. 66 at [3942]. Furthermore, during 1990 one of the written criteria 
GOPAC used to determine where it could "have an impact on 
elections," and thus where it should "target" its efforts, was whether 
there was "an important governor's race or a key U.S. Senate 
campaign." Exh. 66 at [3947-3948]. For example, during 1989 
GOPAC had solicited contributions for a Detroit city council 
candidate, in part to influence the upcoming U.S. Senate election in 
Michigan: "But the stakes are bigger than just the city of Detroit. 
There is the whole of Michigan, with a U.S. Senate election up this 
year. We win statewide when we get at least 23% in Wayne County. 
We lose the state when we get our usual ].9% in Wayne County. As a 
City Councilor, Dr. Butler will have a forum to help get at least the 
23% we need to win the Senate race. * * * I need your help. We are 
asking that our Charter Members take this extra chance to make a 
difference that will affect the entire national agenda." Exh. 66 at 
[3785-3786]. GOPAC Charter Members subsequently forwarded 
$17,000 in contributions to the Butler Campaign. Exh. 66 at [4414, 
4559]. In another example, GOPAC's political director wrote "there is 
a US Senate race [in Montana] that could benefit from significant 
legislative activity," Exh. 66 at [3945], see also Exh. 66 at [3898], and 
in Texas there is a "[s]trong Governor race and Gramm is up," Exh. 66 
at [3946], apparently a reference to Republican United States Senator 
Phil Gramm who was a candidate for re-election that year. Another 
document states that GOPAC targeted "three legislative seats in this 
area to help create ground swell" for 1990 Texas congressional 
candidate Dick Waterfield. Exh. 66 at [5519].  
 
e. Recruiting Congressional Candidates 
 
During 1989, GOPAC also began searching for and recruiting 
Republican candidates for Congress. GOPAC mailed a questionnaire, 
Exh. 66 at [5869-5870], to every Republican state legislator in 
America soliciting "demographic :information," including the 
recipient's congressional district and the name and party affiliation of 
the incumbent Representative and asking: "While we know that the 
political winds often change the best laid plans, at this time would you 
consider a campaign for Congress in your future? * * * If no, is there 
any particular reason." Exh. 66 at [5688; 5870]. By June 1990 
Gingrich was already discussing "recruiting 300 serious candidates" 
who could be competitive within a year. Exh. 66 at [4004]. At least 
thirty-four of the identified potential candidates actually ran for 
Congress in 1990 or 1992.  
 
In 1990, nine new members of Congress had "receiv[ed] training, tapes 
and/or cash, some beginning as far back as 1982" from GOPAC. Exh. 
66 at [3885]. In addition, Congressman Gingrich was re-elected to the 
House of Representatives from Georgia's 6th congressional district, 
winning by only 974 votes. In 1992 "41 of the 48 freshmen Republican 
members of the House were GOPAC 'alumni' -- they'd either 
participated in our live training sessions, received our direct financial 
support or used our audio and video training tapes." Exh. 57. In 
addition, both Congressman Gingrich and other incumbent Republican 
Representatives who were active in GOPAC, such as Joe Barton, were 
re-elected. Although Republicans gained ten congressional seats in 
1992, they failed to capture control of the U.S. House of 
Representatives. In the November 9, 1994 general election, 75 non-
incumbent Republican candidates were elected to Congress, thereby 
obtaining control of the U.S. House of Representatives for the first 
time since 1954. Twenty-five (or one-third) of the 75 freshman 
Republican members of Congress were GOPAC farm team members. 
Exh. 58.  
 
2. GOPAC's Public Statements Influenced Federal Elections.  
 
GOPAC's "Campaign For Fair Elections" letter, described extensively 
above, was typical of most of its other mass mailings. GOPAC sent 
"almost one letter a month." Exh. 21 at [Riddle33, 68]. Each letter 
contained a "bogeyman," some issue or threat that was in the national 
news at the time. One of the recurring themes was the alleged 
corruption of the Democratic majorities in Congress. Exh. 21 at 
[Riddle37]. "[F]or instance, when [Congressman Gingrich] was 
investigating [then-Speaker] Jim Wright, we used Jim Wright. During 
the years when we were preparing for the redistricting of congressional 
districts, we used redistricting. It just depended what was the issue that 
we thought would be of interest to our people." Exh. 21 at [Riddle27]. 
GOPAC used national mailing lists, and focused only on national 
political issues. Exh. 21 at [Riddle33, 36, 37].  
 
The letters contained the same basic message: defeat the Democratic 
incumbent Representatives and elect a Republican Majority, and 
contribute to GOPAC to help GOPAC continue its efforts to elect a 
majority in the House. During 1990, one of GOPAC's direct mail 
letters asked GOPAC contributors to "make a personal commitment 
right now to take advantage of our once-in-a-decade chance to 
translate our party's Presidential majority to the Congressional and 
state legislative level this November." Exh. 31 at [2792] (emphasis in 
original). That letter, inter alia, described GOPAC's activities as 
"laying the groundwork for a new generation of GOP Congressmen 
and Senators, men and women who can communicate our Party's 
message to the voters and work effectively in Washington to put that 
message into action." Exh. 31 at [2793] (emphasis in original).     
 
In 1989, GOPAC also began using telemarketing as a follow-up to its 
direct mail efforts. Exh. 66 at [2926]. This telemarketing was designed 
to increase its receipts, "to disseminate information about its programs 
and purpose, and to obtain valuable information about various 
segments of its constituency." Exh. 66 at [29:26]. GOPAC's 
telemarketers reiterated the themes reflected in GOPAC's direct mail 
solicitation letters, including GOPAC's assertion that "the only way 
we'll ever restore honesty to Congress is to end the Democrats' 33 year 
control of the House of Representatives," id. at [2919], and discussed 
GOPAC's plans to "groom candidates for the national level," including 
providing "in-depth issue reviews and seminars for candidates and 
incumbents." Id. at [2923]. Follow-up correspondence specifically 
stated that contributions to GOPAC would "allow us to help more 
Reagan-republican candidates at both the state and national level." Id. 
at [2916].  
 
Taken alone, these communications are admissions that GOPAC's 
purpose was the election of the particular Republican candidates who 
would be running for the United States House of Representatives in 
1990.  
 
3. GOPAC Advocated the Election Or Defeat Of Particular Federal 
Candidates.   
 
In addition to the campaign appeals to elect the particular Republican 
congressional candidates, GOPAC's mass mailings during 1989 and 
1990 also advocated the election or defeat of particular individual 
candidates for federal office. This further demonstrates that GOPAC's 
major purpose was influencing the election of federal candidates.  
 
a. Vice President George Bush  
 
For example, an August 12, 1988 GOPAC direct mail letter advocated 
the election of Republican presidential candidate George Bush, asking 
the recipient: "will you sign the personal message of support to Vice 
President Bush that I've enclosed with my letter?" Exh. 28 at [2686].  
 
"As he begins his general election campaign against the liberal/ 
Democratic Party coalition headed by Michael Dukakis, I know that 
the Vice President would deeply appreciate knowing of your personal 
support and commitment.  
 
More than any polls he may see, it's important for him to learn directly 
from individuals like you, the mainstays of our Party, that he can count 
on your vote and support in the months ahead."  
 
The enclosed note the recipient was to sign stated, in relevant part:  
 
"I want you to know that as you accept our Party's Presidential 
nomination and prepare to lead our Party against Michael Dukakis and 
the liberal/Democratic coalition, you have my full support. You can 
count on my vote [on] Election Day and my commitment to help you 
carry forward the Reagan agenda into the 1990s."  
 
Exh. 29 at [2689]. The accompanying reply form, which was to be 
returned to GOPAC, contained similar language: "I have signed and 
enclosed my message of support to Vice President Bush. He can count 
on my support and my vote this November." Exh. 28 at [2690]. This 
correspondence predated the June 1989 mailing which was the subject 
matter of the Commission's complaint in this litigation.  
 
b. Congressman Jim Wright  
 
Various GOPAC letters singled out then-Speaker Wright, who was a 
candidate for re-election in 1988 and 1990. For instance. in a 
December 1987 letter GOPAC wrote:  
 
"We put tremendous pressure on the Democratic leadership of the 
House to crack-down on the unprecedented corruption among 
Democratic congressmen.  The fact is the Democrats aren't used to the 
public spotlight being put on them. I promise you that in the months 
ahead, we will continue to expose the sleazy behavior of House 
Democrats. including Speaker Wright, as part of our campaign to elect 
a Republican House majority and clean up Congress."  
 
Exh. 28 at [2600] (emphasis in original).  
 
GOPAC's "Campaign for Fair Elections" mailings described the then-
pending allegations against Speaker Wright and other Democratic 
congressmen, stating "[w]orst of all, they've entrenched themselves 
into a permanent majority in Congress. It's now practically impossible 
to defeat a sitting member of Congress." Exh. 30 at [1729, 2709, 
2720], see id. at [2735].  
 
c. Congressman Gingrich 
 
The minutes from a June 1989 GOPAC "long-range planning" meeting 
stated that "Newt must be re-elected" to Congress. Exh. 66 at [4007]. 
During, at least 1989 and 1990. GOPAC routinely and continuously 
provided what was described as "Newt support" Exh. 66 at [288 
:3993]; Exh. 36 at 46, expenditures for projects "especially for Newt." 
Exh. 66 at [288]. For instance. GOPAC paid political consultants, 
including Jeff Eisenach, Joe Gaylord, Eddie Mahe and Steve Hanser, 
to advise Congressman Gingrich. "to help Newt think." Exh. 33 at 43; 
Exh. 36 at 49-50. Indeed, "help[ing] Newt" was described as "probably 
the most single high priority we've got in dollars ...." Exh. 33 at 43.  
 
By August 1990 Jeff Eisenach was spending approximately one-half to 
two-thirds of his time on "Newt support" projects. Exh. 36 at 46-47. 
Not only did GOPAC pay the salaries to provide these and other 
services -- between $80,000 to $96,000 per year for Eisenach alone, 
Exh. 36 at 47 -- but GOPAC also paid their travel expenses: "If Newt 
decides he's got a Saturday free in Georgia. he wants people a[r]ound 
him. And GOPAC pays those bills. I mean we pay for them to fly 
down there. We pay for them to stay at the Buckhead Ritz Carlton." 
Exh. 36 at 50. Expenditures for "Newt support" were estimated to 
exceed $250,000 in 1990. Exh. 36 at 90.  
 
At the 1990 North Pole Basin meeting there was a discussion of 
spending priorities, including whether and how much to spend on 
"Newt support." One Charter Member expressed the following 
concern: I'm not sure what kind of support we should be giving Newt. 
I agree  with the support, but I mean Jeff Eisenach is a political 
consultant. * * * [A]t least in theory [Bill] Rosing [a prior GOPAC 
consultant] was guiding the future politics of GOPAC. I don't sense 
that that's true of Jeff Eisenach." Exh. 36 at 47.  
 
However, most participants at this and other GOPAC meetings, 
concluded that it was very  important to provide these consulting 
services:   
 
"MALE VOICE: Newt needs interplay, Newt needs to talk with all of 
us, Newt needs people like Jeff [Eisenach] here, and Lutzback and 
Steve [Hanser] and others. GOPAC is able to provide all of that to 
Newt. It's able to provide it in a way that most of you understand. So 
we're able to provide that to Newt and that's happened." Exh. 33 at 42.   
 
One participant provided a specific example.   
 
"FEMALE VOICE: But he seems to need that. I mean . . . the other 
morning when they invaded Kuwait, he walked in the building. He 
found out on the way in the building for a 7 o'clock meeting. He had 
me place a call to Steve Handser [sic] right away. He talked to Steve 
Handser before he got on the phone with the White House and the 
national security people.  
 
He needs that . . . "  
 
"FEMALE VOICE: Well, and I absolutely agree that he needs it. 
Because I have always said -- (inaudible) -- political candidates don't 
do anything until you talk to somebody else about it. Because you can 
get blind-sided -- (inaudible). You can get blind-sided and do 
something that has a consequence that you hadn't thought of."  
 
* * *  
 
"FEMALE VOICE: So I think he -- there's no question he needs his 
people out there. (inaudible)"  
 
Exh. 36 at 49. Thus, during, at least. 1989 and 1990, GOPAC funded 
consultants to support Congressman Gingrich.  
 
The notes of a June 1989 meeting, the notes reflect a discussion of 
actions to be taken "to inoculate Newt Gingrich from Democrat 
attacks." Exh. 66 at 4023. These included "[p]roduction of a 30 minute 
video tape using excerpts from the RNC speech, the Firing Line debate 
and the National Press Club speech, etc. to get Newt's message into the 
mainstream" and "[w]ide distribution by GOPAC of [Congressman 
Gingrich's] National Press Club speech on audio tape." Exh. 66 at 
[4023]; see also Exh. 31 at [2033]; Exh. 66 at [3849, 3851].    
 
GOPAC's desire to support Gingrich also was an explicit factor in its 
deciding how to allot its resources during 1990. GOPAC Political 
Director Tom Morgan's June 1990 memorandum discussed the 
"reverse coat tails" effect of state candidates on federal elections and 
recommended Georgia as one of the states to target in 1990. Exh. 66 at 
3948. The recommendation referred to Congressman Gingrich, stating 
"[o]bviously, GOPAC has a deep interest in Georgia, but it goes 
beyond Newt." Exh, 66 at [394S]. GOPAC's 1990 Report to its Charter 
Members confirms that GOPAC targeted Georgia during that election 
cycle in part "to protect Congressman Newt Gingrich" during 
redistricting. Exh. 66 at [3896]. GOPAC recruited Georgia legislative 
candidates and conducted live and video training seminars there. Exh. 
66 at [3896] In fact. according to the l 990 Report, GOPAC conducted 
seven candidate training sessions in Georgia during 1990, more than in 
any other state. Exh. 66 at [3905] As the election approached, GOPAC 
"targeted 2 House seats and 6 Senate races for special assistance" and 
hired . . . as Southern Field coordinator to help candidates in Georgia 
and Tennessee. Exh. 66 at [3896]. GOPAC also contributed to the 
Republican candidates in the "targeted" districts. Exh. 66 at [2010-
2013; 3986]. Apparently, these were the first contributions GOPAC 
"ever made to candidates in Georgia." Exh. 66 a+ [2009].  
 
GOPAC also encouraged Charter Members to support incumbent 
Republicans financially by contributing to the~ National Republican 
Congressional Committee and to individual congressional campaigns. 
Gingrich testified he told Charter Members "if they truly wanted to 
have a Republican majority, they both had to give FEC money to the 
NRCC and to FEC campaigns to keep the current team ...." Exh. 23 at 
[Gingrich64]. "I would say routinely to successful people, you should 
be meeting your Federal Election Commission limit in campaigns you 
believe in that are Federal." Exh. 23 at [Gingrich64]. These requests 
for contributions apparently were successful, particularly for Gingrich. 
According to the campaign finance reports filed with the Commission, 
of the $539,328 that GOPAC Charter Members identified by the 
Commission contributed to all candidates for the U.S. House of 
Representatives during 1989- 1990, $124,503 (or 23%) was 
contributed to Congressman Gingrich's own authorized principal   
campaign committee. Exh.10 /12  
 
In sum, GOPAC's activities were not only devoted primarily to its 
overarching goal of capturing control of the United States House of 
Representatives, but also focused on the election or defeat of specific 
federal candidates. Thus, even under the strictest construction of the 
Act, GOPAC was a federal political committee.  
 
V. CONCLUSION 
 
GOPAC's activities fall within the historic area of federal partisan 
electoral expenditures and solicitations of contributions that Congress 
sought to encompass in the Act's definition of political committee. 
These activities demonstrate that GOPAC's major purpose was to 
influence the election of the members of the United States House of 
Representatives. Thus, GOPAC is far from the boundary the Supreme 
Court drew around issue-advocacy organizations to prevent the Act 
from chilling their discussion of issues. Moreover, if this Court defers 
to the Commission's construction of the Act's definition of "political 
committee" as it should, then there is no need to scrutinize the purpose 
of each of GOPAC's activities. As the Commission has consistently 
found, once a partisan group, like GOPAC, expends or accepts more 
that $1,000 to influence the election of a class of federal candidates+ 
as occurred in the "Campaign For Fair Elections" letters, the group was 
required to register and file reports as a federal political committee. 
Accordingly, the Federal Election Commission requests that this Court 
grant summary judgment on behalf of the Commission and set a 
briefing schedule for the appropriate sanction.

1 GOPAC has not contested that the Commission complied with the 
statutory pre-filing prerequisites with respect to Counts I and 2. The 
parties are engaged in settlement negotiations on the other issue --

H.R. No. 93-1438, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. at 83, reprinted +n FEC, 
Legislative Historv of the Federal Election Campaign Act 
Amendments of 1974 at 1027 (Every ' orgcmization which expends 
any funds or commits any act directed to the public for the purpose of 
influencing the outcome of an election, or which publishes or 
broadcasts to the public material intended to influence public opinion 
with respect to candidates for Federal office [is required] to register 
with the Commission as a political committee and report the source 
and amount oi its funds and of its expenditures. Since these 
organizations use their resources for political purposes, often having a 
direct and substantial effect on the outcome of Federal elections, it 
would be inappropriate to permit these organizations to conceal the 
interests they represent solely because the organizations are able to 
avoid reporting and disclosure under the technical deimitions of 
political committee, contribution, and expenditure").  
 
4 The Commission has promulgated regulations permitting federal 
political committees to establish a federal account and a non-federal 
account. Committees who comply with the regulation are required to 
report only the activity in the federal account. 11 C.F.R. 106.5 and 
106.6. GOPAC currently only reports 10% of its expenditures as 
allocated to its federal account. Exh. 7 at 117.  
 
5 Potential Charter Members were recruited with a brochure promising 
that "[a]s a Charter Member, you will have unique opportunities to 
plav an active role in shaping the political debate for the future." Exh. 
66 at [5726] (emphasis oriiginal). The brochure then describes 
opportunities for meetings with the President, the White House staff 
and the Republican leadership in Congress. This theme was repeated in 
personal recruiting letters. See, e.g., Exh. 66 at [4448] ("these meetings 
present a rare opportunity to meet and discuss with top political figures 
and strategists the current issues on the national agenda"); Exh. 66 at 
[4578, 4609] ("give you a chance to make recommendations to 
Newt"); Exh. 66 at [4597, 4616, 4655] ("One of the things that makes 
GOPAC so unique is the opportunity for our Charter members to work 
with Newt Gingrich and to influence his issues and direction"). 
Congressman Gingrich would routinely issue an open invitation to 
Charter Members to walk with him in the morning for an "hour of 
uninterrupted conversation." Exh. 66 at [4642, 4299, 4263]. 
Occasionally, a Charter Member appears to have written a letter 
requesting assistance while enclosing a check for Charter membership. 
See, e.g., Exh. 66 at [4854-56, 58] (effect of asbestos regulations on a 
Charter Member's company); Exh. 66 at [4807] (international trade 
dumping litigation involving a Charter member's company).  
 
6 See, e.g., Exh. 48 "In an Aug. 19 letter to Gingrich, some 125 House 
Democrats called on Gingrich to open GOPAC's books." [Roll Call 
9/l5/94]; Exh. 50 "The Speaker's Secret Money" "Federal law requires 
complete disclosure by groups like GOPAC [sic] that aid Federal 
candidates, without fine distinctions." [NY Times editorial 4/25/95.]  
 
7 These Commissioners observed that "Advisory Opinion 1988-22 
upholds a long-standing Commission approach: the purpose and 
functions of an organization are material and relevant to the 
Commission's characterization of the underlying plurpose of a specific 
activity or program of that entity. . . This approach is consistent with 
lthe Supreme Court's decision in [MCFL], where the Court indicated 
that if a major purpose of an orgarlization may be regarded as 
campaign activity, the organization would be subject to the 
oblig+ations and restrictions of a political committee.... Therefore, 
Republican Associates' status as a "political organization" for Federal 
income tax purposes under 26 U.S.C. 527(e'l, as well as its explicit 
corporate purpose to "elect more Republicans to office," support the 
inference that its proposed activities are for the purposes of influencing 
the 1988 elections. Exh. 46 AO 1982-22, Fed. Election Camp. Fin 
Guide (CCH) 11 5932 at 11,474 (citations omitted).  
 
8. Cf. FEC v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee, 59 
F. 3d 1015, 1021 (lOth Cir. 1995)(citing FEC v. DSCC, 454 U.S. at 29 
n.1), pet. for cert. filed, (Expenditures to influence a federal election by 
state party committees are contributions under the Act even before the 
Party has selected its candidate). A Republican Party advertisement 
giving "the impression that the Republic Party sought to 'diminish' 
public support for [the named expected Democratic candidate] and 
'garner support' for the unnamed Republican candidate" was a 
coordinated expenditure to influence the general election. Id. at 1023.  
 
9 The NRCC "is a non profit, political association that supports 
Republican Party candidates for election to the United States House of 
Representatives. NRCC's primary activity is fundraising." NRCC v. 
Legi-Tech Corp., 795 F.2d 190, 191 (D.C. Cir. 1986).  
 
10 At GOPAC's request, National Review magazine published a 
special issue for the workshop which was mailed to more than 140,000 
subscribers. Workshop attendees received copies ofthis special issue 
on May l9th. Exh. 66 at [4588].  
 
11 GOPAC initially targeted twenty-two congressional districts, and 
then eighty. Exh. 66 at [2991 ;4666]. By 1990, this had grown to 170 
districts -- just the number of congressional seats GOPAC believed 
necessary to win control of Congress. Facts 195.  
 
12 The next largest recipient was Congressman Joe Barton, himself a 
recruiter of many Charter members for GOPAC and a frequent 
attendee at GOPAC planning sessions. He received $ 19,050 (or 3.5% 
of the total). Exh. 10.

CASE NO. CV 94-0187 MRP   



Proposition 187 is an initiative measure which was submitted to the

voters of the State of California in the November 8, 1994 general

election. It was passed by a vote of 59% to 41% and became effective

the following day. The stated purpose of Proposition 187 is to

"provide for cooperation between [the] agencies of state and local

government with the federal government, and to establish a system of

required notification by and between such agencies to prevent illegal

aliens in the United States from receiving benefits or public services

in the State of California." Prop. 187, Section 1. The initiative's

provisions require law enforcement, social services, health care and

public education personnel to (i) verify the immigration status of

persons with whom they come in contact; (ii) notify certain defined

persons of their immigration status; (iii) report those persons to

state and federal officials; and (iv) deny those persons social

services, health care, and education.  



After the initiative was passed, several actions challenging the

constitutionality of Proposition 187 were commenced in state and

federal courts in California. Ultimately, five actions filed in the

United States District Court were consolidated in this Court for

purposes of motions, hearings, petitions and trial (collectively, the

"consolidated actions").[FN1] [FN2]  



The plaintiffs in the consolidated actions have brought suit for

declaratory and injunctive relief seeking to bar California Governor

Pete Wilson ("Wilson"), Attorney General Dan Lungren ("Lungren"), and

other state actors[FN3] (collectively, defendants) from enforcing the

provisions of Proposition 187.[FN4  



On November 16, 1994, the Court entered a temporary restraining order

enjoining the implementation of sections 4, 5, 6, 7 2nd 9 of the

initiative. On December 14, 1995, the Court granted plaintiffs'

motions for preliminary injunction, enjoining the implementation and

enforcement of those sections.  



On May 1, 1995, the League of United Latin American Citizens ("LULAC")

and Gregorio T. plaintiffs brought motions for 5ummary judgment in

which they contend that Proposition 187 is unconstitutional on the

sole ground that the initiative is preempted by the federal

government's exclusive constitutional authority over the regulation of

immigration, Congress' exercise of that power through the Immigration

and Nationality Act ("INA"), and other federal statutes.[FN5] [FN6]

Defendants[FN7] oppose the LULAC and Gregorio T. motions on the

grounds that Proposition 187 is not preempted and, alternatively, that

if any portion of the initiative is preempted, the remaining portions

are valid and must be upheld.  The Court grants in part and denies in

part the motions for summary judgment in accordance with the

conclusions reached below. Because the Court's ruling with respect to

these motions does not dispose of this case in its entirety, the

preliminary injunction shall remain in effect until further order of

the Court.  



I. Purpose and Effect of Proposition 187  



Proposition 187 consists of ten sections: a preamble (section 1), a

section pertaining to the amendment and severability of the initiative

(section 10) and eight substantive sections (sections 2-9).[FN8]

Within the eight substantive sections of the initiative, there are the

following five types of provisions:  



(1) provisions which require state officials to verify or determine

the immigration status of arrestees, applicants for social services

and health care, and public school students and their parents, by

either classifying persons based on state-created categories of

immigration status (the "classification" provisions) or verifying

immigration status by reference to federal immigration laws (the

"remaining verification" provisions) (Prop. 187 Sections 4(b);

5(b),(c); 6(b),(c); 7(a)-(e); 8(a)-(c) )[FN9];  



(2) provisions which require state officials to notify individuals

that they are apparently present in the United States unlawfully and

that they must "either obtain legal status or leave the United

States"(the "notification" provisions) (Prop. 187 Sections 4(b)(2); 5

(c)(2); 6(c)(2));  



(3) provisions which require "state agencies to report immigration

status information to state and federal authorities, and to cooperate

with the INS regarding persons whose immigration status is suspect

(contained in Sections 4-9) (the "cooperation/reporting" provisions)

(Prop. 187 Sections 4(b)(3); 5(c)(3); 6(c)(3); 7(e); 8(c); 9);  



(4) provisions which require facilities to deny social services,

health care services and public education to individuals based on

immigration status (the "benefit denial" provisions) (Prop. 187

Sections 5(b), (c)(1); 6(b), (c)(l); 7(a)(c); 8(a)-(b)); and  



(5) criminal penalties for falsifying immigration documents (Prop 187

Sections 2, 3).  



The full text of the initiative is set forth in Appendix A.  



The initiative has a dual purpose and effect. The classification,

notification and cooperation/reporting provisions taken together

constitute a regulatory scheme designed to deter illegal aliens from

entering or remaining in the United States by (1) detecting those

persons present in the United States in violation of either

state-created criteria for lawful immigration status or federal

immigration laws; (2) notifying those persons of their purported

unlawful status and ordering them to obtain legal status or leave the

country; and (3) maintaining a system of reporting and cooperation

between state and federal agencies to effect the removal of those

persons. These provisions cannot be read except" as a regulatory

scheme; and indeed, defendants have not seriously urged Any other

reading. While the benefits denial provisions also have the purpose of

deterring illegal aliens from entering or remaining in the United

States, and arguably may be viewed As part of the same regulatory

scheme, they have the additional purpose of forbidding the use of

public funds to provide social services, health care and education to

persons deemed to be present in the United States illegally.  



II. Severability of the Initiative 



In determining the validity of Proposition 187, the Court is mindful

of its obligation to uphold the initiative to the fullest extent

possible. California law holds that "all presumptions favor the

validity of initiative measures and mere doubts as to validity are

insufficient." Legislature v. Eu, 54 Cal. 3d 492, 501, 286 Cal. Rptr.

283, 287 (1991). Initiatives "must be upheld unless their

unconstitutionality clearly, positively, and unmistakably appears."

Id. A finding that a section, subsection or subpart of Proposition 187

is preempted by federal law does not end the Court's inquiry with

respect to the validity of the initiative. Rather, a finding that any

provision is preempted requires the Court to determine whether that

provision is severable from the balance of the initiative so that the

remainder may take effect. See Calfarm Ins. Co. v. Deukmejian, 48 Cal.

3d 805, 821, 258 Cal. Rptr. 161, 170 (1989) (a holding that a

subdivision of an initiative is invalid under the state and federal

Constitutions requires a determination as to whether the invalid

provision is severable from the initiative). Whether any preempted

provision of Proposition 187 is severable from the remainder of the

initiative is determined pursuant to California law. National Broiler

Council v. Voss, 44 F.3d 740, 748 n.l2 (9th Cir. 1994).  



Section 10 of Proposition 187 provides:  



In the event that any portion of this act or the application thereof

to any person or circumstance is held invalid, that invalidity shall

not affect any other provision or application of the act, which can be

given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to that

end the provisions of this act are severable.  



"Although not conclusive, a severability clause normally calls for

sustaining the valid part of the enactment, especially when the

invalid part is mechanically severable . . . [citation]'" Calfarm, 48

Cal. 3d at 821, 258 Cal. Rptr. at 170 (citation omitted). The

existence of a severability clause does not conclusively resolve the

severability inquiry, however. Rather, "[t]he final determination

depends on whether 'the remainder . . . is complete in itself and

would have been adopted by the legislative body had the latter

foreseen the partial invalidity of the statute . . .' and 'is not so

connected with the rest of the statute as to be inseparable.'" Santa

Barbara Sch. Dist. v. Superior Court, 13 Cal. 3d 315, 331, 118 Cal.

Rptr. 637, 650 (1975) (citations omitted).  



California courts have prescribed three criteria by which a reviewing

court must assess the severability of invalid provisions of statutes.

In order to be severable, "the invalid provision must be

grammatically, functionally, and volitionally separable." Calfarm, 48

Cal. 3d at 821, 258 Cal. Rptr. at 170. A provision is grammatically

severable if "it constitutes a distinct and separate provision . . .

which can be removed as a whole without affecting the wording of any

other provision," 48 Cal. 3d at 822, 2S8 Cal. Rptr. at 170, or "where

the valid and invalid parts can be separated by paragraph, sentence,

clause, phrase or even single words." Santa Barbara Sch. Dist., 13

Cal. 3d at 330, 118 Cal. Rptr. at 649. However, where "the defect

cannot be cured by excising any word or group of words, the problem is

quite different," and severance is inappropriate. Santa Barbara Sch.

Dist., 13 Cal. 3d at 331, 118 Cal. Rptr. at 649.  



A provision is functionally severable if the remaining provisions can

"stand on their own,- are capable of "separate enforcement, People's

Advocate. Inc. v. Superior Court, 181 Cal. App. 3d 316, 33132, 226

Cal. Rptr. 640, 649 (1986), can be "given effect," Raven v.

Deukmejian, S2 Cal. 3d 336, 355, 276 Cal. Rptr. 326, 338 (1990), or

can operate . . . independently" of the invalid provisions. EU, 54

Cal. 3d at 535, 286 Cal. Rptr. at 310. The remaining provisions must

neither be "rendered vague" by the absence of the invalid provisions

nor "inextricably connected to them by policy considerations.People's

Advocate, 181 Cal. App. 3d at 332, 226 Cal. Rptr. at 649.  



Finally, an invalid provision is volitionally severable if the

remaining provisions "would likely have been adopted by the people had

they foreseen the invalidity" of the challenged provision, or if the

provision was not "so critical to the enactment of [the initiative]

that the measure would not have been enacted in its absence.Calfarm,

48 Cal. 3d at 822, 258 Cal. Rptr. at 170. Stated differently, "[t]he

test [for volitional severability] is whether it ; can be said with

confidence that the electorate's attention was sufficiently focused

upon the parts to be severed so that it would have separately

considered and adopted them in the absence of the invalid portions."

People's Advocate, 181 Cal. App. 3d at 333, 226 Cal. Rptr. at 650.

Under the volitional severability test, even if the "'heart of [the]

[p]roposition'" is found invalid, if some "'substantive provisions

remain,'" the invalid part should be severed to enforce the valid

provisions and achieve at least "some substantial portion of [the

voters'] purpose." Gerken v. Fair Political Practices Co., 6 Cal. 4th

707, 714-15, 25 Cal. Rptr. 2d 449, 457 (1993) (quoting City of

Woodlake v. Logan, 230 Cal. App. 3d 1058, 1070, 282 Cal. Rptr. 27

(1991); Santa Barbara Sch. Dist., 13 Cal. 3d At 332, 118 Cal. Rptr. at

650).  



Plaintiffs contend that Proposition 187 is not severable because its

"pervasive unconstitutionality" leaves nothing to salvage. In

addition, they argue that the provisions of the initiative fail to

meet the three criteria for severability. They contend, for example,

that the classification provisions are not grammatically severable

because their absence would render the remaining verification

provisions unintelligible. They argue that none of the verification

provisions are functionally severable because their absence would

render the denial of benefits provisions inoperable. Finally, they

argue that the notification and reporting provisions are not

volitionally severable from the benefits denial provisions because the

intention of the electorate in passing the initiative was to enact a

comprehensive scheme to "stop illegal aliens," and severing the

notification and reporting provisions to salvage the benefits denial

provisions would frustrate the electorate's intent.  



Defendants counter that the initiative meets all three severability

tests. That is, defendants argue that the initiative is volitionally

severable because the severability clause reflects the electorate's

intent to accept the implementation of any valid provisions

notwithstanding the invalidation of others, grammatically severable

because each section, subsection and subpart of the initiative can be

severed from the others without rendering remaining sections

unintelligible and functionally severable because each section,

subsection and subpart is capable of operating independently from the

others.  



Before analyzing the severability of each of the challenged provisions

of Proposition 187, two general comments on the grammatical and

volitional severability of the initiative as a whole are warranted.

First, defendants are correct that each of Proposition 187's ten

sections, and their respective subsections, is a distinct grammatical

unit and thus is capable of being "severed from the other sections and

subsections without affecting the wording of any other section or

rendering what remains unintelligible. Accordingly, any section or

subsection within Proposition 187 which is found to be invalid is

grammatically severable from the remainder of the initiative.  



Second, defendants are also correct that the initiative is

volitionally severable. Plaintiffs' contention to the contrary --

that, for example, the denial of benefits or criminal penalties

provisions would not have been adopted had the people foreseen the

success of challenges to the reporting and notification provisions --

is unavailing. Proposition 187's declaration of intent explicitly

states that a substantial purpose of the initiative is to "prevent

illegal aliens in the United States from receiving benefit or public

services in the State of California. Section 1. Elsewhere in the

initiative it is stated that it is 'the intention of the People of

California that only citizens of the United States and aliens lawfully

admitted . . . may receive the benefits" of public social services,

health care, and education. Sections 5(a); 6(a); 7(a); 8(a). Further,

"[e]ven though ... the full purpose of [the initiative] cannot be

realized, it seems eminently reasonable to suppose that those who

favor the proposition would be happy to achieve at least some

substantial portion of their purpose." Santa Barbara Sch. Dist., 13

Cal. 3d at 331-32, 118 Cal. Rptr. at 650. It cannot be disputed that

the denial of benefits to "illegal aliens" (in sections 5 through 8)

and the criminalization of the manufacture and use of false

immigration documents (in sections 2 and 3) serve a significant part

of the initiative's purpose. The Court is therefore convinced that if

the voters had known that some of the initiative's provisions would be

held invalid, they would have preferred the implementation of the

remaining portions, rather than the invalidation of the entire

initiative. Any provisions of Proposition 187 found to be invalid are

volitionally severable from the remainder.  



Thus, the provisions of Proposition 187 which are preempted must be

severed from the initiative. A copy of the initiative as severed in

accordance with this Opinion follows in Appendix B. The Court's

preemption analysis follows.  



III. Whether Proposition 187 is Preempted Under Federal Law  



The question of whether provisions of Proposition 187 are preempted by

federal law is governed by the Supreme Court's decision in De Canas v.

Bica, 424 U.S. 351 (1976) (California statute prohibiting an employer

from knowingly employing an alien who is not entitled to lawful

residence in the United States held not preempted under federal law).

In De Canas, the Supreme Court set forth three tests to be used in

determining whether a state statute related to immigration is

preempted. Pursuant to De Canas, if a statute fails any one of the

three tests, it is preempted by federal law.  



Under the first test, the Court must determine whether a state statute

is a "regulation of immigration." Since the "[p]ower to regulate

immigration is unquestionably exclusively a federal power,id. at 354,

any state statute which regulates immigration is "constitutionally

proscribed." Id. at 356.  



Under the second test, even if the state law is not an impermissible

regulation of immigration, it may still be preempted if there is a

showing that it was the "clear and manifest purpose of Congress" to

effect a "complete ouster of state power -- including state power to

promulgate laws not in conflict with federal laws" with respect to the

subject matter which the statute attempts to regulate. Id. at 357. In

other words, under the second test, a statute is preempted where

Congress intended to "occupy the field" which the statute attempts to

regulate.  



Under the third test, a state law is preempted if it "stands as an

obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and

objectives of Congress." Id. at 363 (citing Hines v. Davidowitz, U.S.

52, 67 (1941)). Stated differently, a statute is preempted under the

third test if it conflicts with federal law making compliance with

both state and federal law impossible. Michigan Canners & Freezers v.

Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Board, 467 U.S. 461, 469 (1984);

Florida Lime & Avocado Growers v. Paul, 373 U.S. 132, 142-43 (1963).  



A. Whether Proposition 187 Constitutes an Impermissible Regulation of

Immigration.  



The federal government possesses the exclusive power to regulate

immigration. De Canas, 424 U.S. at 354-355 ("Power to regulate

immigration is unquestionably exclusively a federal power.") That

power derives from the Constitution's grant to the federal government

of the power to "establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization," U.S.

Const. art. I, Section 8, cl. 4., And to "regulate Commerce with

foreign Nations." Id., cl. 3. In addition, the Supreme Court has held

that the federal government's power to control immigration is inherent

in the nation's sovereignty. See, e.g., Nishimura Ekiu v. United

States, 142 U.S. 651, 659 (1892) (recognizing inherent power of

sovereign nation to control its borders); Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202,

225 (1982) ("Drawing upon [its Article I, section 8] power, upon its

plenary authority with respect to foreign relations and international

commerce, and upon the inherent power of a sovereign to close its

borders, Congress has developed a complex scheme governing admission

to our Nation and status within our borders"); Fiallo v. Bell, 430

U.S. 787, 792 (1977) ("Our cases 'have long recognized the power to

expel or exclude aliens as a fundamental sovereign attribute exercised

by the Government's political departments . . .'" (citation omitted)).

 



Congress has exercised its power over immigration in the Immigration

and Naturalization Act, 8 U.S.C. Section 1101 et seq. (the "INA"). The

INA is a comprehensive regulatory scheme which regulates the

authorized entry, length of stay, residence status and deportation of

aliens. See Gonzales v. City of Peoria, 722 F.2d 468, 474-75 (9th Cir.

1983) (recognizing that the regulatory scheme created by the INA is so

pervasive as to be consistent with the exclusive federal power over

immigration). The INA delegates enforcement duties to the Immigration

and Naturalization Service ("INS").  



Because the federal government bears the exclusive responsibility for

immigration matters, the states "can neither" add to nor take from the

conditions lawfully imposed by Congress upon admission, naturalization

and residence of aliens in the United States or the several states."

Takahashi v. Fish & Game Comm'n, 334 U.S. 410, 419 (1948). See also

Plyler v. Doe, 42S U.S. 202 at 225 (1982) ("The States enjoy no power

with respect to the classification of aliens.(citing Hines v.

Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52 (1941))).  



In De Canas, in reasserting the rule that "[p]ower to regulate

immigration is unquestionably exclusively a federal power," the

Supreme Court emphasized that the mere fact that a state statute

pertains to aliens does not require a finding that it is preempted:

"the Court has never held that every state enactment which in any way

deals with aliens is a regulation of immigration and thus per se

preempted by this constitutional power . . ." 424 U.S. at 355. The

Court stressed that "the fact that aliens are the subject of a state

statute does not render it a regulation of immigration, which is

essentially a determination of who should or should not be admitted

into the country, and the conditions under which a legal entrant may

remain." 424 U.S. at 355.  



In this case, plaintiffs urge that the entirety of Proposition 187

constitutes a scheme to regulate immigration and is therefore

preempted. They assert that the initiative as a whole is a regulation

of immigration because it forces state employees to make judgment as

to an individual's immigration status, gives them the power to

effectuate removal of immigrants from the country and thereby

establishes California's own INS. Defendants counter that pursuant to

De Canas, "regulation of immigration" has a "narrow, technical

meaning"; that a facial challenge to this statute requires a

"painstaking line-by-line analysis" of the statute; and that such

analysis reveals that, standing alone, none of Proposition 187's

individual sections or subsections is "essentially a determination of

who should or should not be admitted into the country and on what

terms those lawfully admitted can remain here." De Canas, 424 U.S. at

355.  



In De Canas, the statute at issue provided that "[n]o employer shall

knowingly employ an alien who is not entitled to lawful residence in

the United States if such employment would have an adverse effect on

lawful resident workers." Id. at 352 n. 1; Cal. Lab. Code Section

2805. Noting that in that case, California had "sought to strengthen

its economy by adopting federal standards in imposing criminal

sanctions against state employers who knowingly employ aliens who have

no federal right to employment within the country," the Supreme Court

found that the statute did not constitute an immigration regulation,

but rather, had only "some purely speculative and indirect impact on

immigration." Id. at 355.  



Unlike the statute at issue in De Canas, various of Proposition 187's

provisions have much more than a "purely speculative and indirect

impact on immigration." Indeed, Proposition 187's verification,

notification and cooperation/reporting requirements directly regulate

immigration by creating a comprehensive scheme to detect and report

the presence and effect the removal of illegal aliens. The scheme

requires state agents to question all arrestees, applicants for

medical and social services, students, and parents of students about

their immigration status; to obtain and examine documents relating to

the immigration status of such persons; to identify "suspected"

"illegal" immigrants present in California; to report suspected

"illegal" immigrants to state and federal authorities; and to instruct

people suspected of being in the United States illegally to obtain

"illegal status" or "leave the country." Thus, Proposition 187's

scheme has a direct and substantial impact on immigration.  



Further, certain of Proposition 187's provisions require state agents

to make independent determinations of who is subject to the

initiative's benefits denial, notification and cooperation/reporting

provisions and who may lawfully remain in the United States. Unlike

the statute at issue in De Canas, which adopted federal standards to

determine whether an individual's immigration status subjected an

employer to liability, Proposition 187's classification provisions

create an entirely independent set of criteria by which to classify

individuals based on immigration status. See, e.g., Prop. 187 Sections

5(b); 6(b); 7(d).  



On the other hand, the benefits denial provisions of sections 5

through 8 may be likened to the statute at issue in De Canas. While

the denial of benefits to persons not lawfully present in the United

States may indirectly or incidentally affect immigration by causing

such persons to leave the state or deterring them from entering

California in the first place, such a denial does not amount to a

"determination of who should or should not be admitted into the

country." De Canas, 424 U.S. at 355. Accordingly, the benefits denials

provisions are not impermissible regulations of immigration and thus

are not preempted under the first De Canas test.  



It is true, as plaintiffs argue, that benefits denial can only occur

after an applicant"s legal status has been "determined." That is,

absent some verification process, eligibility for benefits based on

immigration status would be impossible. Moreover, state agents are

unqualified -- and also unauthorized -- to make independent

determinations of immigration status. Congress has exclusively

reserved that power to the INS and to immigration judges pursuant to

the INA. See 8 U.S.C. Section 1252(b); 8 C.F.R. Section 242.1(a).

Indeed, determinations of immigration status by state agents amounts

to immigration regulation whether made for the purposes of notifying

aliens of their unlawful status and reporting their presence to the

INS or for the limited purpose of denying benefits.  



Defendants contend that because state agents are required to and do

make determinations of immigration status in administering benefits

under certain federal-state cooperative programs, eligibility for

which Congress has conditioned on lawful immigration status, such

determinations may also be made by state agents for purposes of

denying benefits under Proposition 187. Indeed, the Systematic Alien

Verification for Entitlements program ("SAVE"), 42 U.S.C. Section

1320b-7, is an existing federal eligibility system used to verify

status for various federal-state cooperative programs such as the Aid

to Families with Dependent Children ("AFDC"), Food Stamps, Medicaid

and Unemployment Compensation programs under which eligibility is

dependent on lawful immigration status. See 42 U.S.C. Section

1320b-7(b)(l) and 45 C.F.R. Section 233.50 (AFDC); 42 U.S.C. 55

1320b-7(b)(2) and 1356b(v)(1) (Medicaid); 7 U.S.C. Section 2015(f) and

42 U.S.C. Section 1320b7(b)(4) (Food Stamps). These benefits programs

require state agents to verify immigration status by accessing federal

immigration status information through SAVE. In administering

state-federal cooperative benefits programs, however, state agents

perform a ministerial rather than a discretionary function in

verifying immigration status. That is, state agents merely access INS

information to verify an applicant's immigration status -- no

independent determinations are made and no state-created criteria are

applied. A requirement that state agents merely verify immigration

status by referring to INS information is much different from a

requirement that state agents actually make determinations as to who

is, and who is not, deportable under federal law. Permitting state

agents, who are untrained -- and unauthorized -- under federal law to

make immigration status decisions, incurs the risk that inconsistent

and inaccurate judgments will be made. On the other hand, requiring

state agents simply to verify a person's status with the INS involves

no independent judgment on the part of state officials and ensures

uniform results consistent with federal determinations of immigration

status.  



The benefits denial provisions of Proposition 187 may therefore be

implemented without impermissibly regulating immigration if state

agencies, in verifying eligibility for services and benefits, rely on

federal determinations of status made by the INS and accessible

through SAVE. Because state regulations implementing Proposition 187

could require state agencies to verify immigration status through

reference to INS information and could deny state actors discretion to

apply non-federal criteria for benefits eligibility, Proposition 187"s

benefits denial provisions are not an impermissible regulation of

immigration and therefore withstand scrutiny under the first De Canas

test.  



Accordingly, the classification, notification and

cooperation/reporting provisions of the initiative, contained in

sections 4 through 9 and in the preamble, which are aimed solely at

regulating immigration, are preempted. The provisions which have the

permissible purpose and effect of denying state-funded benefits to

persons who are unlawfully present in the United States are not a

regulation of immigration and therefore survive the first De Canas

test.  



1. Section 4 



Section 4, entitled "Law Enforcement Cooperation with the INS,"

requires law enforcement agencies to verify the legal status of every

arrestee who is "suspected of being present in the United States in

violation of federal immigration laws" by "questioning the person" and

"demanding documentation." Section 4(b)(1). Section 4 requires law

enforcement agencies to "[n]otify the person of his or her apparent

status as an alien who is present in the United States in violation of

federal immigration laws and inform him or her that . . . he or she

must either obtain legal status or leave the United States. Section

4(b)(2). In addition, section 4 requires the agency to "[n]otify the

Attorney General . 4(b)(3). Finally, section 4 requires law

enforcement agencies to "fully cooperate with the [INS] regarding any

person who is arrested if he or she is suspected" of being in the

United States illegally and prohibits any local governmental agency

from limiting such cooperation in any way. Section 4(a), (c).  



Under the first De Canas test, a state may not require its agents to

(i) make independent determinations of who is and who is not in this

country "in violation of immigration laws;" (ii) report such

determinations to state and federal authorities; or (iii) "cooperate"

with the INS, solely for the purpose of ensuring that such persons

leave the-country. The sole stated purpose and the role effect of

section 4 is to impermissibly regulate immigration. Accordingly,

section 4 is entirely preempted by federal law under the first De

Canas test.  



2. Sections 5 and 6 



Section 5, entitled "Exclusion of Illegal Aliens from Public Social

Services," And section 6, entitled, "Exclusion of Illegal Aliens from

Publicly Funded Health Care," differ from section 4 in that their

stated purpose and effect is not solely to ensure the ouster of

persons suspected of being in this country unlawfully. Rather, they

have the additional purpose and effect of excluding persons from

obtaining public social and health care services. To the extent that

state actors deny benefits to persons based on determinations by

federal authorities that those individuals are deportable pursuant to

federal law, benefits denial is not a direct regulation of

immigration, but rather, has only the possible indirect effect of

deterring "illegal" aliens from coming to California or causing them

to leave.  



Sections 5 and 6 do not merely deny benefits, however. Both sections

contain classification, notification and cooperation/ reporting

provisions which are roughly parallel to those contained in section 4.

See Sections 5(b), (c)(l), (c)(2); 6(b), (c)(1), (c)(2). These

provisions are entirely unnecessary to the implementation of the

benefits denial provisions. That is, without those three sets of

provisions, both sections S and 6 still require public entities and

publicly-funded health care facilities to deny benefits to persons who

are determined to be in the United States in violation of federal law.

See Sections 5(c)(1), 6(c)(1).[FN10]  



The classification, notification and cooperation/reporting provisions

in Sections 5 and 6 add nothing to the statute except that they expand

Proposition 187's impermissible scheme of immigration regulation -- by

requiring agents of the state (i) to make independent determinations

of who is and who is not "lawfully admitted" in this country, based on

state-created criteria (subsection (b)); and (ii) to report such

determinations to state and federal authorities solely for the purpose

of ensuring that such persons leave the country (subsections (c)(l)

and (c)(2)).  



In addition, subsection (b) is an impermissible immigration regulation

because, unlike the statute at issue in De Canas, the classification

of persons as (1) citizens; (2) lawfully admitted as a permanent

resident or (3) lawfully admitted for a temporary period is not in any

way tied to federal standards. Thus, the state has created its own

scheme setting forth who is, and who is not, entitled to be in the

United States. As discussed below, the INS's standards for who is and

who is not deportable are entirely different from those set forth in

subsection (b). See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. Section 1251(a). As the Supreme

Court held in De Canas, a state cannot, on its own, determine who is

or is not entitled to be present in the United States. See De Canas,

424 U.S. at 355.  



Defendants contend that the Court should construe the term "lawfully

admitted" in subsections (b)(l) And (b)(2) as applying "to persons who

are present in the United States unlawfully, not to those who entered

unlawfully." They argue that such a construction avoids preemption,

because "lawfully present" is an immigration status standard applied

under the INA, and thus the classification of persons required under

subsection (b) of Sections 5 and 6 would be tied to federal standards,

rather than to state-created criteria. This argument is not

persuasive. As plaintiffs point out, the term "lawfully admitted" has

its own established meaning under the INA. See 8 U.S.C. Section

1182.[FN11] Thus, there is no basis for the Court to replace the word

"admitted," with the word "present." Moreover, even if the Court were

to do so, the statute still would not be tied to federal standards.  



The impermissible classification, notification, and

cooperation/reporting requirements of sections 5 and 6, subsections

(b), (c)(2), and (c)(3), are therefore preempted.  



In the absence of the scheme created by those sections, the remaining

substantive provisions of sections 5 and 6 are contained in

subsections 5(c)(1) and 6(c)(1). Those provisions, standing alone,

require that state agents deny benefits to persons who are determined

or suspected to be "in the United States in violation of federal law."

Defendants contend that (c)(l) is not an immigration regulation

because, absent the classification, notification, and reporting

provisions, (c)(1)'s effect is solely to deny benefits -- not to

determine who should or should not be permitted to remain in the

United States.  



Indeed, in the absence of subsections (b), (c)(2) and (c)(3),

subsection (c)'s verification component is utilized solely for the

purpose of denying benefits. Unlike subsection (b), subsection

(c)(1)'s verification component is tied to federal immigration

standards, so that under subsection (c)(1), benefits are denied based

on an individual's federally-determined immigration status and not on

any independent criteria developed by the state.  



Plaintiffs counter that (c)(1) is not tied to any federal or state

immigration standards and is therefore preempted because, on its face,

subsection (c)(1) would deny benefits not only to aliens who are

deportable under federal immigration law but also to aliens who have,

for example, failed to file their tax returns, because technically

such persons would be "alien[s] in the United States in violation of

federal law." This is a tortured reading of the provision. The Court

is obliged to uphold subsection (c)(1) if there is any construction of

the provision which is constitutional. Clearly (c)(1) can, and should,

be understood to require denial of benefits solely to deportable

aliens (i.e., those aliens whose presence in the United States is in

violation of federal immigration law). The Court must conclude that

subsection (c)(1) denies benefits based on federal determinations of

immigration status and is not an impermissible regulation of

immigration. Such benefits denial is not preempted under the first De

Canas test.   



One additional problem remains. Subsection (c)(1) requires state

agents to deny benefits to any individual who is "determine[d] or

"reasonably suspect[ed]" to be present in the United States in

violation of federal law. Thus, on its face, (c)(1) requires state

actors to make independent determinations as to whether a person is

deportable under federal law. As discussed above, under the first De

Canas test, state actors may not make independent determinations as to

persons' immigration status. Only the INS can make such

determinations, and so (c)(1) may survive only if benefits are denied

only to those persons determined to be deportable by the INS. This

problem is not irremediable, however. If the words "or reasonably

suspects, based on the information provided to it," are severed from

the subsection (c), sections 5 and 6 no longer would deny benefits to

persons who are merely suspected by a state agent, rather than

determined by the INS, to be deportable. And those words indeed are

grammatically, functionally, and volitionally severable. The language

"or reasonably suspects, based on the information provided to it," is

grammatically severable, since when it is omitted, the remaining

language makes sense. The offending language is also functionally

severable, because denial of benefits can be implemented in its

absence. That is, a person can be denied benefits if the

administrating agent "determines," rather than merely "reasonably

suspects . . ." that the person is present in the country in violation

of federal laws. Finally, the "reasonably suspects" language is

volitionally severable because the severability clause evidences the

intent of the electorate to permit the severance of offending

portions, and because it cannot be argued that the language was

crucial to the passage of the initiative  



Even in the absence of the "reasonably suspects" language, however, it

is still possible that under subsection (c)(l) state actors could be

required to deny benefits based on their own independent

determinations as to persons' immigration status. To avoid this

result, the state could implement n regulation requiring officials to

verify eligibility for services and benefits by accessing INS

determinations of individuals' immigration status through the SAVE

system. If the "reasonably suspects" language is omitted, And a

regulation implementing the benefits denial provisions required state

agencies to utilize INS determinations in denying benefits, subsection

(c)(1) would not impermissibly regulate immigration. It would then

withstand scrutiny under the first De Canas test.  



The question remains whether the invalid provisions of sections 5 and

6 are severable from the remainder of the initiative. Plaintiffs

contend that subsections (b), (c)(2) and (3) are not functionally

severable from the remaining provisions in sections 5 and 6 and that a

finding that subsections (b), (c)(2) and (c)(3) are preempted requires

a finding that all of sections 5 and 6 are preempted. However, as set

forth above, subsection (c)(l) can operate independently as a benefits

denial provision absent the impermissible immigration regulation

scheme. Therefore, subsections (b), (c)(2) and (c)(3) are functionally

severable from the initiative. Because it is reasonable to conclude

that the electorate would have preferred the implementation of the

benefits denial provisions rather than the invalidation of the entire

initiative had they foreseen the invalidity of the classification,

notification and cooperation/reporting provisions, subsections (b),

(c)(2) and (c)(3) are volitionally severable. Finally, subsection

(c)(1) makes grammatical sense absent the severed provisions.

Accordingly, subsections (b), (c)(2) and (c)(3) are severable.  



3. Section 7 



Section 7 is entitled "Exclusion of Illegal Aliens From Public

Elementary and Secondary Schools." Like sections 5 and 6, section 7

contains classification, notification and cooperation/reporting

requirements that, taken together, serve only to further the scheme to

regulate immigration and are unnecessary to the denial of public

education.  



In section 7, subsections (a) through (c) require schools to verify

the immigration status of children for the purposes of denying access

to public elementary and secondary education. Subsection (d) requires

verification of the immigration status of parents of school children.

Subsection (e) requires school districts to report the "illegal"

status of any parent, guardian, enrollee or pupil to state agencies

and the INS. Subsection (f) requires school districts to "fully

cooperate" in "accomplish[ing] an orderly transition to a school in

the child's country of origin."  



Subsections (a), (b) and (c), together, assure that undocumented

children will be denied access to public education. Subsection (d) is

wholly unnecessary to implementing the denial of education mandated by

section 7, because the state has no need to know the immigration

status of parents in order to deny benefits to children. Like

subsection (b) in sections 5 and 6, the only purpose and effect of

subsections (d), (e), and (f) is to ensure that persons determined by

the state to be in the United States unlawfully are "transitioned" to

the "country of their origin." Subsections (d), (e) and (f) are part

of an impermissible scheme to regulate immigration and are therefore

preempted under the first De Canas test.  



In any event, an analysis of section 7 under the rigors of the first

De Canas test is not necessary to sustain the Court's ruling on these

motions. In light of the United States Supreme Court's decision in

Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982), in which the Court held that the

Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states

from excluding undocumented alien children from public schools,

section 7 in its entirety conflicts with and is therefore preempted by

federal law.  



4. Section 8 



Subsection (a) of Section 8 prohibits public postsecondary educational

institutions from providing education to persons who are not

"authorized under federal law" to be in the United States. Subsection

(b) requires such institutions to verify the immigration status of

each person enrolled or attending to ensure that education is provided

only to persons who are "authorized under federal law" to be in the

United States. Subsection (c) requires admissions officers to report

any persons who are "determined to be, or . . . under reasonable

suspicion of being in the United States in violation of federal

immigration laws" to state and federal authorities.  



Subsection 8(c), like the reporting requirements in sections 5 and 6,

cannot survive because it has no purpose other than to regulate

immigration. On the other hand, subsections (a) and (b), like the

denial of benefits in sections 5 and 6, are not regulations of

immigration since they do not amount to determinations of who may and

may not remain in this country. In the absence of subsection (c)'s

reporting requirements, the verification components of subsections (a)

and (b) are permissible because their only purpose is to determine who

may and who may not receive postsecondary education. Also, the

verification components of subsections (a) and (b) are tied to federal

standards rather than to an impermissible state classification scheme.

Because subsections (a) and (b) may be implemented by requiring state

actors to rely on federal determinations rather than their own

independent determinations of immigration status to deny public

postsecondary education, subsections (a) and (b) are not preempted

under the first De Canas test.  



The final question is whether subsection (c) is functionally,

volitionally and grammatically severable from the remaining provisions

of section 8. Since the absence of the impermissible reporting

requirements does not impair the state's ability to deny public

postsecondary education, subsection (c) is functionally severable.

Subsection (c) is grammatically severable because the removal of

subsection (c) does not render the remaining provisions of section 8

unintelligible. Finally, because it is reasonable to conclude that the

electorate would have preferred the implementation of the remaining

provisions rather than the invalidation of the entire section had they

foreseen the invalidity of the cooperation/reporting provision,

subsection (c) is volitionally severable.  



5. Section 9 



Section 9, entitled, "Attorney General cooperation with the INS,"

requires the state attorney general to maintain records of, and to

transmit to the INS, all reports received from state agencies

pertaining to persons who are "suspected of being present in the

United States in violation of federal immigration laws." This section

is preempted under the first De Canas test because it has no purpose

or effect except to further Proposition 187's impermissible

immigration regulation scheme.  



Section 9 is a separate and distinct section of Proposition 187, the

severance of which does not impair the meaning of any remaining

sections. It is, therefore, grammatically severable from the remainder

of the initiative. Section 9 i5 functionally severable because it

merely imposes additional reporting and record-keeping requirements

beyond those required by the other sections of the initiative and

eliminating these additional requirements does not impair the

operation of the remaining sections. Finally, because the initiative's

remaining benefits denial and criminal penalty provisions serve a

substantial purpose of the electorate and would have been approved

even absent the invalid provisions, section 9 is volitionally

severable.[FN12]  



6. Sections 2 and 3 



Sections 2 and 3 criminalize making and using false documents "to

conceal" the "true citizenship or resident alien status" of a person.

These provisions, though they may indirectly affect immigration in

some way,[FN13] can hardly be said to be a "determination of who

should or should not be admitted in to the country. n Like the benefit

denial provisions, the criminal penalties, criminalizing conduct that

is dishonest and deceptive, are a legitimate exercise of the police

power of the state.  



Plaintiffs contend that criminal penalties are part of the overall

immigration regulation scheme. Absent the verification, notification

and cooperation/reporting elements of the initiative, however, the

criminal penalties do not serve the impermissible goal of ensuring

that "illegal" aliens leave the country. Accordingly, sections 2 and 3

are not preempted under the first De Canas test.  



B. Whether Proposition 187 Is Preempted Because Congress Intended to

Occupy the Field.  



Under the second De Canas test, even if a statute is not an

impermissible regulation of immigration, it may still be preempted if

there is a showing that Congress intended to "occupy the field" which

the statute attempts to regulate. De Canas, 424 U.S. at 357. 





As discussed above, the Constitution commits the power to regulate

immigration exclusively to the federal government. De Canas, 424 U.S.

at 354, 356. Congress has fully occupied the field of immigration

regulation through enactment and implementation of the INA. See, e.g.,

Gonzalez v. City of Peoria, 722 F.2d 468 (9th Cir. 1983) ("We assume

that the civil provisions of the [INA] regulating authorized entry,

length of stay, residence status, and deportation, constitute such a

pervasive regulatory scheme, as would be consistent with the exclusive

federal power over immigration."). Since the classification,

notification and cooperation/reporting requirements contained in

sections 1 and 4 through 9 constitute a scheme to regulate

immigration, those provisions are necessarily preempted under the

second De Canas test as well.  



Because the Court has determined that the benefits denial and criminal

provisions in sections 2 and 3 are not impermissible regulations of

immigration, the question remains whether these provisions are

nevertheless preempted because Congress has intended to occupy the

field on which they touch. Under the second De Canas test, the

benefits denial provisions of sections 5 through 8 are preempted only

if they regulate a field in which Congress intended a "complete

ouster" of state power, even if a state regulation in that field is

not in conflict with federal law. See De Canas, 424 U.S. at 356, 357.

In De Canas, the Supreme Court defined the field on which the statute

in question touched not as the broad field of immigration regulation,

but, rather, the more narrow field of employment of illegal aliens.

Id. Finding nothing in the INA which indicated Congressional intent to

preclude state regulation touching on the employment of illegal

aliens, the Court refused to "presume that Congress . . . intended to

oust state authority to regulate the employment relationship covered

by the [statute]," and held that the-statute was not preempted. Id. at

357.  



Similarly, the field on which Proposition 187's benefits denial

provisions touch is not the broad field of immigration regulation but,

rather, the public benefits field, specifically alien eligibility for

public benefits. Since nothing in the wording or legislative history

of the INA "unmistakably confirms" an intent to oust state authority

to regulate in the public benefits field, and because, As in De Canas,

such an intent cannot be "derived from the scope and detail of the INA

. . . governing entry and stay of aliens," id. at 359, Proposition

187's benefits denial provisions are not preempted under the second De

Canas test.[FN14] 





Likewise, the criminal provisions set forth in sections 2 and 3 are

not preempted under the second De Canas test. Plaintiffs have made no

showing whatsoever that Congress intended to effect a "complete ouster

of state power -- including state power to promulgate laws not in

conflict with federal laws" with respect to criminalizing the

falsification and use of forged identification documents. 424 U.S. at

357. -The field on which sections 2 and 3 touch is not the broad field

of immigration regulation but, rather, the field of the criminal law

as it relates to false documents. Since nothing in the legislative

history of the INA, or in the INA itself, reveals an intent to oust

state authority to criminalize the production or use of false

identification, sections 2 and 3 are not preempted under the second De

Canas test. 





C. Whether Proposition 187 Is Preempted Because It Directly Conflicts

With Federal Law  



The final inquiry under De Canas is whether, "although the INA

contemplates some room for state legislation" De Canas, 424 U.S. at

363, Proposition 187 is preempted in whole or in part because it

"stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full

purposes and objectives of Congress." Id. (citing Hines v. Davidowitz,

312 U.S. 52, 67 (1941)). Stated differently, the provisions of

Proposition 187 may be preempted because they conflict with federal

law making compliance with both state and federal law impossible.

Michigan Canners & Freezers, 467 U.S. at 469.  



1. Classification, Notification, and Reporting Provisions  



As set forth above, Proposition 187's classification, notification and

cooperation/reporting provisions are preempted under the first and

second De Canas tests because taken together, they constitute an

impermissible scheme for the regulation of immigration. Those same

provisions also violate the third De Canas test, because they are in

conflict with federal laws governing the deportation of aliens.  



The INA specifies an exclusive list of grounds for deportation, 8

U.S.C. 1251(a), and provides that that procedure shall be the "sole

and exclusive procedure for determining the deportability of an

alien." 8 U.S.C. Section 1252(b) (emphasis added). The procedure

requires, among other things, that only a "special inquiry officer"

(an immigration judge) may conduct deportation proceedings. Id. The

INA's accompanying regulations require "[e]very proceeding to

determine the deportability of an alien in the United States [to be]

commenced by the filing of an order to show cause with the Office of

the Immigration Judge." 8 C.F.R. Section 242.1(a); 8 U.S.C. 1252a. The

authority to issue such orders is delegated to a discrete list of

federal officers. Id. Only specified federal officials can commence

deportation proceedings, and only an immigration judge in deportation

proceedings can determine that an alien is deportable and order the

alien to leave the United States. Id.; 8 U.S.C. Sections 1252(a),

1252(b). Then, after a "final order" of deportation issues, only the

Attorney General may "effect the alien's departure from the United

States." 8 U.S.C. Section 1252(c).  



Proposition 187's classification, notification and

cooperation/reporting provisions directly contradict the INA's mandate

that the procedure outlined in the INA "shall be the sole and

exclusive procedure for determining the deportability of an alien."

These provisions create a new, wholly independent procedure, pursuant

to which state law enforcement, welfare, health care, and education

officials -- rather than federal officials and immigration judges --

are required to determine the deportability of aliens and effect their

deportation. The classification, notification and cooperation/

reporting provisions delegate to state agents tasks which federal law

delegates exclusively to federal agents. These provisions are in

direct conflict with and are preempted by federal law.  



2. Denial of Benefits Provisions 



a. Conflicts based on classification and remaining verification

provisions  



Proposition 187 requires, for the implementation of its benefits

denial provisions, that public social service agencies, public health

care facility personnel, public school districts and postsecondary

educational institutions classify or verify the immigration status of

applicants for benefits and services.  



Plaintiffs argue that because the classification provisions define

legal immigration status more narrowly than federal law, and because

the remaining verification provisions require state agents to classify

persons' immigration status based-on "suspicion," those provisions

will result in the denial of benefits to persons who fail to meet

state criteria but are nevertheless lawfully present in the United

States under federal law. The plaintiffs contend that both types of

verification provisions are preempted under the third De Canas test.  



Defendants argue that the initiative "does not set up a classification

system" at all and that the classification provisions, like the

remaining verification provisions which are tied to federal standards,

should be construed as applying only to persons who are present in the

United States in violation of federal immigration laws.  



(1) The classification provisions 



As discussed above, Proposition 187 establishes three state-created

categories of lawful immigration status on which the denial of

benefits is based. These categories define persons as "legal" and

entitled to receive benefits if they are citizens of the United

States, aliens lawfully admitted as permanent residents and aliens

lawfully admitted for a temporary period of time. See Section5

5(b)(1)-(3), 6(b)(1)-(3), 7(d)(1)-(3). These three categories,

however, fail to recognize several federal categories of persons who

are not citizens, not admitted as permanent residents and not admitted

for a temporary period of time but who are nevertheless present in the

United States, authorized to remain here and eligible for certain

benefits in accordance with federal law. For example, federal law

authorizes certain refugees,[FN15] asylees,[FN16] persons granted

withholding of deportation,[FN17] parolees,[FN18] persons protected by

"family unity" status,[FN19] persons present under temporary protected

status,[FN20] persons granted deferred enforced departure

("DED"),[FN21] persons eligible for suspension or stay of

deportation[FN22] and battered immigrant women and children[FN23] to

remain in the United States permanently, indefinitely or temporarily.

None of these categories of lawful immigration status is accounted for

by Proposition 187's classification scheme.  



Sections 5, 6 and 7 utilize this underinclusive classification scheme

to deny benefits and services to persons who fail to meet state

criteria for lawful immigration status but are lawfully present in the

United States and entitled to receive benefits and services under

federal law. Congress has conditioned eligibility for some

federal-state cooperative benefits programs covered by sections 5 and

6 on lawful immigration status under federal immigration laws. For

example, eligibility for the Medicaid, Aid to Families with Dependent

Children ("AFDC") and Food Stamps programs depends on verification of

immigration status through the SAVE system. In Administering these

programs, state agencies verify recipient immigration status by

accessing INS information. Since some persons otherwise eligible for

benefits under federal standards would be excluded by Proposition

187's underinclusive classification scheme, denying services based on

the classification scheme conflicts with the existing federal

eligibility system for programs administered under SAVE. This

classification scheme, preempted under the first and second De Canas

tests, is also preempted under the third De Canas test as used to deny

social and health services under sections 5 and 6 and education under

section 7.  



The question remains whether the impermissible classification scheme

in subsection (b) of sections 5 and 6 and subsection (d) of section 7

is severable from the remainder of the initiative. The subsections are

grammatically severable because their absence does not render the

remaining subsections unintelligible. The subsections are functionally

severable because the benefits denial provisions may be implemented by

utilizing the remaining verification provisions in subsection (c) of

sections 5 and 6 and subsections (b) and (c) of section 7 which bases

denial of benefits and services on federal immigration standards.

Finally, the subsections are volitionally severable because it cannot

be said that voter approval of the initiative was dependent on any

particular classification scheme as long as the effect was the denial

of benefits and services to illegal aliens. Thus; subsection (b) of

section 5 and 6 and subsection (d) of section 7 are preempted by

federal law but may be severed from the remainder of the initiative.  



(2) The remaining verification provisions  



Subsection (c) of sections 5 And 6 provides that if any public entity

"determines or reasonably suspects, based or the information provided

to it," that an applicant for benefits or services is an "alien in the

United States in violation of federal law," the entity shall deny the

benefits or services. Sections 5(c), 6(c). Subsection (b) of sections

7 and 8 likewise calls for verification of status based on federal

immigration standards by requiring school districts and postsecondary

educational institutions to verify that students and/or parents are

"authorized under federal law to be present in the United States."

5Section 7(b), 8(b). Because these provisions require verification by

reference to federal immigration standards, conflict with that law is

not readily apparent. Because Congress conditions eligibility for

benefits under the AFDC, Food Stamps and Medicaid programs on lawful

immigration status and requires state agents to verify applicant

eligibility by accessing INS information through the SAVE system,

section 5's denial of benefits to persons "in the United States in

violation of federal law" does not conflict with or impede the

objectives of federal law. Section 5 is not preempted to the extent

that it applies to federally funded programs for which Congress has

conditioned benefit eligibility on lawful immigration status.  



Plaintiffs contend, however, that the verification procedure required

by subsection (c) of sections 5 and 6, based on the reasonable

suspicion of state agents, cannot be constitutionally implemented

because denying benefits to those merely suspected of being present in

violation of federal laws conflicts with federal law which entitles

those lawfully present in the United States to the receipt of certain

benefits. In other words, because benefits may be denied under

Proposition 187 to individuals who are in fact lawfully present in the

United States if the administering agent merely reasonably suspects

they are present in violation of federal law, the verification

procedure conflicts with and impedes the objective of federal law with

respect to immigrant benefit eligibility.  



Plaintiffs are correct. Because the only constitutional implementation

of Proposition 187's benefits denial provisions would require state

agents to utilize federal determinations of immigration status, and

because a state agent's "reasonable suspicion" of unlawful immigrant

status is not the same as a federal determination of immigration

status, the "reasonably suspects" language conflicts with federal law.

It is therefore preempted under the third De Canas test The

"reasonably suspects" language in subsection (c) may be severed from

the remainder of subsection (c).  



The remaining verification provisions in sections 7 and 8 pertaining

to the denial of public education do not suffer from the same defect

as their counterparts in sections 5 and 6 because public school

authorities are merely-required to verify a student's immigration

status as lawful under federal law. No "reasonable suspicions" are

involved. Because verification of immigration status by reference to

INS information is permissible through programs such as SAVE, the

remaining verification provisions of sections 724 and 8 are not in

conflict with federal law and are not preempted under the third De

Canas test.  



b. Conflicts based on benefits denial provisions  



As applied to federally-funded programs and federally-funded health

care facilities, the benefits denial provisions of sections 5 and 6,

even if implemented to deny benefits and services only to persons

present in the United States in violation of federal immigration laws,

appear to conflict with various federal laws. It is unclear, however,

from the showing made here whether, under Ray v. Atlantic Richfield

Co.. 435 U.S. 151, 158-160 (1978), these apparent conflicts render the

denial of benefits provisions completely preempted or preempted only

to the extent that they apply to federally-funded benefits. Moreover,

even if the Court were to hold that the apparent conflicts with

federal laws do not completely defeat the denial of benefits

provisions, the defendants have made only a general representation to

the Court that there are purely state-funded benefits and services to

which the initiative could apply. Because the implications of Ray are

unclear and because the Court is not convinced that there actually are

any such wholly state-funded benefits programs and health care

facilities, the Court declines to rule on whether the denial of

benefits provisions are preempted. Nevertheless the Court sees several

apparent conflicts between the operation of the benefits denial

provisions and various federal laws.  



(1) Section 5 



The remaining benefits denial provision of section 5 provides that

"any public entity" shall not provide benefits or services to persons

determined to be "alien[s] in the United States in violation of

federal law." Section 5(c)(1). my its plain language, section 5

applies to "any public entity" in the state of California and covers

"public social services" or "benefits and services" administered by

those entities. Id. "Public social services" is broadly defined under

California law to include:  



those activities and functions of state and local government

administered or supervised by the department [of Social Services] or

the State Department of Health Services and involved in providing aid

or services or both . . . to those people of the state who, because of

their economic circumstances or social condition, are in need thereof

and may benefit thereby.  



Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code Section 10051. The Court concludes that

Section 5 broadly denies any and all aid, services And programs

administered or supervised by the state departments of social and

health services to persons without lawful immigration status under

federal law. Accordingly, to the extent that section 5 would deny

public social services to persons entitled to receive them under

federal law, section S conflicts with federal law. Plaintiffs argue

that section 5's denial of public social services conflicts with

federal law regardless of whether eligibility is based on the

impermissible underinclusive classification scheme in subsection (b),

or on federal immigration standards referenced in subsection (c),

because Proposition 187 conditions eligibility for some federal-state

cooperative programs on lawful immigration status where the federal

legislation authorizing such programs imposes no such requirements.

Specifically, plaintiffs contend that there is a conflict between

section 5 and the Women, Infants, and Children program[FN25] and child

welfare services[FN26] because benefits are available under these

federally-funded programs regardless of immigration status.  



The Women, Infants and Children program is a federally- funded program

administered by California through the Department of Health Services.

Welf. & Inst. Code Section 15500 et seq. The federal statutes

governing the program do not condition eligibility on lawful

immigration status. See 42 U.S.C. Section 1786. Defendants concede, as

they must, that if the Women, Infants And Children program is a

"public social service" within the meaning of section 5, conditioning

eligibility for benefits under the program on lawful immigration

status conflicts with the federal law which makes those benefits

available regardless of immigration status. Given California's broad

definition of "public social service," Section 5's denial of public

social services clearly applies to the Women, Infants and Children

program. Therefore, section 5's denial of social services as applied

to the program conflicts with federal law.  



Qualified child welfare services programs Administered by states

receive grants of federal funding under various federal laws.[FN27]

Defendants do not dispute that section 5 conflicts with these laws if

construed to apply to federally-funded child welfare programs for

which federal law does not condition eligibility on immigration

status. Rather, defendants argue that child welfare services are

entirely outside the scope of section 5 as a matter of statutory

construction. Defendants contend that subsection 5(C)(1) applies only

to public social service programs to which persons voluntarily and

affirmatively apply. They argue that because child welfare services

are generally extended to children who are involuntarily placed in the

protective custody of the state and are not benefits for which a

person voluntarily applies, section 5 is inapplicable to child welfare

services. This distinction is specious. Section 5 applies broadly to

deny "public social services" and "benefits and services" to persons

present in the United States in violation of federal law. Section

5(c)(1). Child welfare services fall squarely within California's

definition of public social services. See Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code

Section 16500.  



Moreover, some children do affirmatively seek state intervention

(either personally or through a representative). Thus, defendants'

construction of section 5 would deny benefits to children who actively

seek placement with child welfare services, while granting the same

services to children who wait for the state to intervene. Because this

absurd result could not have been contemplated by the voters and

because child welfare services full squarely within California's

definition of public social services, child welfare services are not

excluded from section 5's coverage. 





The question remains, however, whether the application of section 5 to

child welfare services conflicts with federal law. Plaintiffs identify

several federal provisions allocating money to and governing child

welfare services[FN28] that are available to children regardless of

immigration status. Section 5 conditions receipt of child welfare

services on lawful immigration status. Therefore, section 5, as

applied to child welfare services, conflicts with federal law.  



Finally, section 5 may serve to deny state-administered public social

services that are not part of any federal-state cooperative program

and do not receive any federal funding. As noted above, the Court is

unable to conclude that such wholly state-funded programs in fact

exist.[FN29] If such programs do exist, it does not Appear that

section 5's denial of wholly state-funded benefits would conflict with

and be preempted by federal law. That the state's denial of such

benefits may be unconstitutional on other grounds is not a question

before the Court at this time.  



In sum, section 5's benefits denial provisions conflict with federal

law as applied to public social services funded in any part by the

federal government and made available to persons under the authorizing

federal statutes regardless of immigration status. Section 5, to the

extent that it denies benefits under wholly state-funded programs and

under federal-state cooperative programs such as Medicaid, Food Stamps

and AFDC, eligibility for which Congress has already conditioned on

lawful immigration status, does not appear to conflict with federal

law. The Court makes no determination, however, as to whether section

5's benefits denial provision is wholly preempted. A further showing

would be required to reach this conclusion.  



(2) Section 6 



The remaining benefits denial provision of section 6 requires "any

publicly funded health care facility" in California to deny services

"other than emergency medical care as required by federal law" to

persons determined to be "alien[s] in the United States in violation

of federal law." Sections 6(c), 6(c)(1).  



Plaintiffs contend that subsection (c)(1) of section 6, as applied to

health care facilities which receive any federal funding, conflicts

with and is preempted by federal laws, specifically the Hill-Burton

Act,[FN30] the Public Health Services Act ("PHSA"),[FN31] and the

Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act ("EMTALA"),[FN32]

which require the provision of emergency and other health care

services regardless of immigration status.  



Defendants respond that because the goal of section 6 is to prevent

the use of public funds to provide health care services to persons not

lawfully in the country, Hill-Burton and PHSA facilities are not

prevented from providing all services to unlawful immigrants but,

rather, are merely denied public reimbursement for the services so

provided. Further, defendants contend that emergency medical care

required by EMTALA is explicitly excluded from the scope of section 6.

 



(a) The Hill-Burton Act 



The Hill-Burton Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 291 et seq., provides for

allocation of federal funds to states for the rehabilitation,

construction or modernization of public and nonprofit hospitals. See

42 U.S.C. Section 291c. In an application for funds under the Act, the

applicant state and institution must make assurances that:  



(1) the facility or portion thereof to be constructed or modernized

will be made available to all persons residing in the territorial area

of the applicant; and  



(2) there will be made available in the facility or portion thereof to

be constructed or modernized a reasonable volume of services to

persons unable to pay therefor . . . .  



42 U.S.C. Section 291c(e). The regulations promulgated pursuant to the

Act interpret the assurance that the facilities will be made available

to "all persons" to mean that services be provided  



to all persons residing . . . in the facility's service area, without

discrimination on the ground of race, color, national origin, creed or

any other around unrelated to an individual's need for the service or

the availability of the needed service in the facility.  



42 C.F.R. Section 124.603(a)(1) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs argue

that section 6 conflicts with federal law because it requires

Hill-Burton facilities to deny health services based on immigration

status, a ground unrelated to the individual's need or the

availability of needed services. Plaintiffs contend that section 6

must be read to prohibit the provision of all health services to

undocumented persons, even services to be self-paid by the patient or

funded by private charity, and therefore cannot be construed to avoid

conflict with the Hill-Burton Act.  



Defendants argue that Hill-Burton facilities are not prohibited from

providing all services to undocumented persons but, rather, are merely

prohibited from providing publicly-funded services to such persons. In

other words, relying on language in the preamble of section 6

evidencing an intent to deny publicly-funded health caret to persons

present in violation of federal immigration laws, defendants argue

that Hill-Burton facilities may provide self-paid or charitable

services to undocumented persons, and therefore no conflict with

federal law exists. See Section 6(a).  



The plain language of subsection 6(c)(1) broadly prohibits Zany

publicly-funded health care facility"[FN33] from providing "health

care services" or "services" other than emergency services required by

federal law. Section 6(c)(1). Despite the language in subsection 6(a)

evidencing an intent to deny undocumented persons "the benefits of

publicly-funded health care" and to "protect public funds from

misuse," subsection (c) contains no such limiting language, and

proscribes the provision of "services," generally, by publicly-funded

health care facilities to persons unlawfully present in the United

States. Sections 6(a), (c). Further, health care facilities do not, as

a practical matter, at the service provider level, make distinctions

between services that are "publicly-funded" and services that are

funded by other sources. It is difficult for the Court to conceive of

a manner in which section 6 could operate under the construction urged

by the defendants. The Court thus declines to eschew the plain

language of the statute in favor of defendant's interpretation.

Section 6 must be construed to require publicly-funded health care

facilities to deny all services other than emergency medical care

required by federal law. Because Hill-Burton facilities must make

their services available to all persons without regard to immigration

status, the operation of Section 6 conflicts with the requirements of

the Hill-Burton Act.  



Even if section 6's denial of health care services is construed to

apply only to publicly-funded services, denying "free" services based

on immigration status nevertheless conflicts with the Hill-Burton

Act's requirement that each recipient facility provide a "reasonable

volume of services to persons unable to pay therefor," 42 U.S.c.

Section 291c(e)(2), without discrimination based on any ground

"unrelated to an individual's need for the service or the availability

of the needed service in the facility Hill-Burton facility is required

to treat any person, regardless of his or her ability to pay, who

appears at the doors simply because the person resides in the facility

s area. Rather, Hill-Burton facilities are required to provide a

"reasonable volume of services" to persons unable to pay without

discriminating between these persons on any basis unrelated to patient

need or service availability. That is, Hill-Burton facilities may not

close the door on a person based merely on immigration status. Section

6's denial of health care services, to the extent it applies to

Hill-Burton facilities, conflicts with federal law.  



(b) Public Health Service Act 



Under the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.s.C. 5 201 et sea., grants

of federal funds are available to public and nonprofit private

entities for projects to plan and develop "community health centers"

to serve medically underserved populations. 42 U.S.C. Section 254c(c).

The Public Health Services Act defines "community health center" as an

entity which, "through its staff . private entities" provides health

and health-related information and referral services to residents of

the area it serves (the "catchment area"). 42 U.S.C. S 254c(a). The

Act provides for grants of federal funds to community health centers

serving areas designated as having a shortage of personal health

services. 42 U.S.C. Sections 254c(c); 254(b)(3). Any hospital or other

facility receiving grants under this section for the purpose of

serving a medically underserved population is a "community health

facility" within the meaning of the Public Health Services Act.

Community health centers funded under section 254c(c) must be

administered to ensure that services are made available and Accessible

in a manner "assuring continuity of service to the residents of the

center's catchment area." 42 C.F.R. 5 51c.303(a).  



Plaintiffs argue that section 6, which prohibits community health

centers from providing any services to catchment area residents in the

United States unlawfully, conflicts with and is preempted by the Act

which requires such facilities to make services available to catchment

area residents regardless of those persons' immigration status.

Defendants respond that facilities deemed "community health centers"

by virtue of their receipt of federal funding under the Act are only

prohibited from providing publicly-funded health services and may

provide self-raid or privately-funded services to undocumented

persons. However, because section 6 requires all "publicly-funded

health care facilities" to deny "health care services" and "services"

other than emergency medical services, and does not by its language

limit such denial to services for which reimbursements with public

money are made, section 6 conflicts with the Public Health Service Act

provisions pertaining to federally-funded community health centers.  



(c) Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act  



EMTALA, 42 U.S.C. Section 1395dd, requires hospitals under Medicare

provider agreements with the federal government to provide "an

appropriate medical screening examination" to "any individual"

requesting medical treatment from hospital emergency departments

regardless of the person's ability to pay. 42 U.S.C. Section

1395dd(a). The screening must include all routinely available

ancillary services, and, if the patient is found to have an "emergency

condition," the hospital is required to provide the care necessary to

stabilize the patient's condition. 42 U.S.C. S 1395dd(b). The hospital

may not delay in providing a screening or treatment required to

stabilize an emergency condition in order to inquire about an

individual's insurance or ability to pay for services. 42 U.S.C.

Section 1395dd(h).  



Plaintiffs contend that section 6 conflicts with EMTALA because it

precludes health care facilities from providing the required screening

to persons whose conditions do not appear to require "emergency

medical care," the only services exempted from section 6. Sections

6(a), 6(c) .[FN34] Defendants argue that subsections (a) and (c), by

creating an exception for "emergency medical care as required by

federal law," exempt all of EMTALA's screening, stabilization and

treatment requirements and therefore do not conflict with federal law.

Id. Because the clear intent of the enacting body was to exempt

"emergency medical care as required by federal law," and it is

reasonable to interpret this exemption to include all of EMTALA's

screening, stabilization and treatment requirements, the Court

concludes that Section 6's denial of health services does not conflict

with but, rather, is entirely consistent with, federal law pertaining

to emergency medical services.  



In sum, section 6 must be construed to require all publicly-funded

health care facilities to deny all medical services, except emergency

screening and treatment procedures required by federal law, to persons

not lawfully present in the United States under federal law. To the

extent that section 6 applies to facilities that receive federal

funding under programs such as the Hill-Burton and Public Health

Services Act and requires denial of non-emergency medical services to

persons unlawfully present where the federal legislation enabling the

programs is silent with respect to the immigration status of medical

care recipients, section 6 conflicts with federal law. However, to the

extent that section 6 applies to wholly state-funded health care

facilities, if in fact such facilities exist[FN35], the denial of

non-emergency health services to persons unlawfully present in the

United States does not appear to conflict with any federal law. While

recognizing these conflicts, the Court cannot determine on the record

before it whether section 6's denial of benefits provision is entirely

preempted or preempted only to the extent that it applies to federal

grant recipient health care facilities. 





(3) Section 7 



Section 7 denies public elementary and secondary education to (i)

children who are in the United States in violation of federal law, and

(ii) children who are citizens or otherwise legally present, but whose

parents or guardians are in the United States unlawfully. See Sections

7(a), 7(e), 7(f). This denial of public education directly conflicts

with federal law As announced in the Supreme Court's decision in

Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982).[FN36] In Plyler, the Supreme Court

held that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment

prohibits a state from denying "to undocumented school-age children

the free public education that it provides to children who are

citizens of the United States or legally admitted aliens." Plyler, 457

U.S. at 205. The Supreme Court rejected each of the state's proffered

justifications for denying education to undocumented children,

including the desire "to protect itself from an influx of illegal

immigrants," to "preserv[e] . . . the state's limited resources for

the education of its lawful residents," and to remove the alleged

"special burdens [undocumented children] impose on the State's ability

to provide high-quality public education -- as constitutionally

insufficient to deny children access to a basic education and noted

the conflict that would result if the state were to deny education to

"a child enjoying an inchoate federal permission to remain." Id. at

226-230. Clearly, then, section 7's denial of a public education based

on the immigration status of the child or the child's parent or

guardian conflicts with and is preempted by federal law as announced

by the Supreme Court in Plyler.[FN37]  



The remaining provisions of section 7, subsections (b), (c), (d) and

(e), require school districts to verify the immigration status of

prospective and current students and their parents or guardians, to

notify students and parents or guardians of their suspected unlawful

status and to report such information to state and federal officials.

These provisions, aimed at regulating immigration or effecting a

denial of public education that is prohibited by federal law, have no

permissible purpose. Section 7 is preempted in its entirety.[FN38]  



(4) Section 8 



Section 8 prohibits public postsecondary educational institutions from

admitting, enrolling or permitting the attendance of persons who are

not "authorized under federal law to be present in the United States."

Section 8(a).  



Plaintiffs do not identify any provision of federal law that conflicts

with section 8's denial of education. On its face, subsection (a) is

consistent with the INS statement permitting aliens "considered to be

residing permanently in the United States under color of law" to study

in the country. Section 8's denial of education to persons who are not

"authorized under federal law to be present in the United States,"

does not appear to conflict with any federal law. Subsection (a) of

section 8 is not preempted under the third De Canas test.  



3. Criminal Penalty Provisions 



Sections 2 and 3 of Proposition 187 make it a crime to manufacture,

distribute, sell or use false documents to conceal true citizenship or

immigration status. Violations of these statutes are punishable by

imprisonment for up to five years or, in the case of manufacturing,

distributing or selling false documents, a fine of up to $75,000 and

for use of such documents, a fine of up to $25,000. Sections 2, 3.

Plaintiffs argue that by imposing different penalties than those

already imposed under federal laws regulating the production or use of

false citizenship, naturalization and alien registration papers and

the misuse or forgery of passports and visas[FN39] sections 2 and 3

conflict with federal law. There has been no showing that the criminal

penalties contemplated by Sections 2 and 3 conflict with or impede the

objectives of federal law. Sections 2 and 3 Are not preempted under

the third De Canas test.  



IV. Conclusion 



The California voters' overwhelming approval of Proposition 187

reflects their justifiable frustration with the federal government's

inability to enforce the immigration laws effectively. No matter how

serious the problem may be, however, the authority to regulate

immigration belongs exclusively to the federal government and state

agencies are not permitted to assume that authority. The State is

powerless to enact its own scheme to regulate immigration or to devise

immigration regulations which run parallel to or purport to supplement

the federal immigration laws.  



The classification, notification and cooperation/reporting provisions

in sections 4 through 9 of the initiative, taken together, constitute

a regulatory scheme (l) to detect persons present in California in

violation of state-created categories of lawful immigration status;

(2) to notify state and federal officials of their purportedly

unlawful status; and (3) to effect their-removal from the United

States. These provisions create an impermissible state scheme to

regulate immigration and are preempted under she first and second De

Canas tests. Plaintiffs' motions for summary judgment are granted with

respect to these provisions.  



The benefits denial provisions of the initiative -- if implemented by

state regulations which would require verification of immigration

status by reference to federal determinations of status -- have only

an incidental impact on immigration and thus do not violate the first

De Canas test. Nor do those provisions violate the second De Canas

test. Plaintiffs have failed to direct the Court to any authority for

the proposition that Congress intended to completely oust state

authority to legislate in the area of benefits denial. Consequently,

the Court must conclude that those provisions are preempted only if

their operation conflicts with or impedes the objectives of federal

laws.  



Section 7's denial of primary and secondary education conflicts with

federal law as announced by the Supreme Court in Plyler v. Doe and is

therefore preempted. Section 8's denial of postsecondary education

does not appear to conflict with any federal law and thus is not

preempted. With respect to the benefits denial provisions in sections

5 and 6, to the extent that they deny federally-funded benefits and

services, those provisions conflict with federal laws authorizing such

benefits and services without reference to immigration status. It is

unclear from the showing made whether the existence of such conflicts

render sections 5 and 6 wholly preempted or preempted only to the

extent that they conflict with federal law. Moreover, the Court may

not need to reach that issue, for while it appears that the state

could permissibly deny wholly state-funded benefits and services

without impeding the objectives of federal law, it is unclear from the

record whether any such purely state-funded programs or health care

facilities in fact exist. The showing made on these motions is

inadequate to permit the Court to resolve the issue of whether the

provisions are wholly preempted or whether they are preempted only to

a limited extent. For these reasons, plaintiffs' motions with respect

to the denial of benefits provisions in sections 5 and 6 are denied.  



Finally, for the reasons set forth above, sections 2 and 3 are not

preempted. Plaintiffs motions with respect to those sections are

denied.  



The preliminary injunction entered by the Court on December 14, 1995,

shall remain in effect until further order of the Court.

Department of Social Services Eloise Anderson ("Anderson"); Director

of Department of Health Kimberly Belshe ("Belshe"); California State

Board of Education; Department of Education; Orange Unified School

District; Tustin Unified School District; and San Diego Unified School

District.  



Children plaintiffs also named Los Angeles Unified School District and

the State of California.  



Ayala plaintiffs also named Dawson; Alhambra Unified School District;

and Superintendent of the Alhambra Unified School District Heber

Meeks.  



Gregorio T. plaintiffs also named Dawson (who was replaced by Eastin);

Anderson; Belshe; individuals who are the members of the California

State Board of Education, in their official capacities; individuals

who are the Regents of the University of California, in their official

capacities; Jack Peltason, president of the University of California;

individuals who are the Trustees of the California State University,

in their official capacities; Barry Munitz, the Chancellor of the

California State University, individuals who are the members of the

Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, and David

Mertes, Chancellor of the California Community Colleges.  



Catholic Hospitals, Islamic Center, and CTA,

plaintiffs-in-intervention, each filed a complaint against the same

persons who were named as defendants by the Gregorio T. plaintiffs.  





(4) In February 1995, Defendants Wilson, Belshe and Anderson brought a

motion for abstention, or in the alternative, to dismiss for failure

to state a claim. Lungren joined in the motion for abstention and also

moved to dismiss. In March 1995 the Court denied these motions and set

this case for trial.  





(5) The following parties joined in LULAC's motion: Defendant San

Diego Unified School District; defendant and amicus curiae Los Angeles

Unified School District; and plaintiffs-intervenors Catholic Hospitals

and Islamic Center.  



The following parties joined in Gregorio T.'s motion: Carlos P. and

Ayala plaintiffs; plaintiffs-intervenors City of Los Angeles, CTA,

Catholic Hospitals, and Islamic Center; and defendant and amicus

curiae Los Angeles Unified School District.  





(6) Catholic Hospitals and Islamic Center brought independent motions

for summary judgment motions based on preemption as well, on May 12,

1995 and May 16, 1995, respectively. Catholic Hospitals and Islamic

Center each joined in the other's motion.  



To the extent that those motions are brought on grounds other than

those raised in the LULAC and Gregorio T. motions, they are denied. To

the extent that those motions rely on the same arguments raised in the

LULAC and Gregorio T. motions, those motions are granted in part and

denied in part in accordance with the ruling set forth in this

Opinion.  





(7) For the purposes of this Opinion, "defendants" means all named

defendants except for the following, who do not oppose the plaintiffs'

motions: (1) the defendants who joined in the motions for summary

judgment (listed in footnote 5); (2) the Regents of the University of

California, who filed a notice of nonopposition to all motions for

summary judgment filed herein; (3) Eastin, who stipulated to the entry

of summary judgment against her on July 28, 1995; and (4) the State

Board of Education, which adopted a resolution declaring neutrality in

this litigation on November 21, 1994.  





(8) The eight substantive sections of the statute are codified as

follows: Section 2 is codified at Cal. Penal Code Section 113. Section

3 is codified at Cal Penal. Code Section 114. Section 4 is codified at

Cal. Penal Code Section 834b. Section 5 is codified at Cal. Welf. &

Inst. Code Section 10001.5. Section 6 is codified at Cal. Health &

Safety Code Section 130. Section 7 is codified at Cal. Educ. Code

Section 48215. Section 8 is codified at Cal. Educ. Code Section

66010.8.  



For the purposes of this Opinion, the initiative's provisions are

referred to by their initiative section numbers rather than by their

California code section numbers (i.e., Cal. Penal Code Section 834b(a)

is referred to as "section 4(a)").  





(9) The verification provisions are of two types. The first type

requires state agents to classify persons based on three state-created

categories of "legal status" without any reference to federal

immigration laws. Specifically, state agents must determine who is a

"citizen" and who is "lawfully admitted" as a permanent resident or

for a temporary period of time. Sections 5(b); 6(b); 7(d). These

provisions are referred to collectively as "classification"

provisions. The remaining verification provisions contain a

"catch-all" category exempting from Proposition 187's denial of

benefits, notification and reporting provisions persons who are

otherwise lawfully present in the United States under federal law.

Sections 4(b)(1); 5(c); 6(c); 7(b), (c); 8(b). These provisions are

referred to collectively as the "remaining verification" provisions.  





(10) As explained above, the benefits denial provisions in subsection

(c) of sections 5 and 6 may be constitutionally implemented only

through a regulation whereby state agents do not themselves determine

a whether a person is lawfully present in the United States and only

verify a person's immigration status for benefits denial purposes by

relying on determinations made by the INS and accessible through SAVE.

 





(11) Those lawfully "admitted" under federal immigration law are those

who an immigration officer determines to satisfy admissibility

criteria at the time of entry. 8 U.S.C. Section 1182. Thus, it is

likely that there are aliens who are lawfully present in the United

States, but who were never lawfully "admitted" as federal law defines

that term. These include, for example, persons who entered illegally

but then were granted asylum under 8 U.s.C. Section 1158. Conversely,

some aliens who were lawfully "admitted" under the INA, but have

overstayed their visas, may no longer be lawfully present. The plain

language of subsection (b)(3) would include these aliens while the

construction urged by defendants would exclude them.  





(12) Section 1, entitled "Findings and Declaration," contains the

following conclusion:  



Therefore, the People of California declare their intention to provide

for cooperation between their agencies of state and local government

with the federal government, and to establish a system of required

notification by and between such agencies to prevent illegal aliens in

the United States from receiving benefits or public services in the

State of California.  



(emphasis added). Since Proposition 187's cooperation/reporting

requirements are preempted, the underlined portion of the preamble

states an impermissible purpose. However, because the preamble has no

practical effect absent the invalid substantive provisions, it is not

subject to the preemption inquiry.  





(13) Plaintiffs have not provided the Court with any example of how

such criminal penalties would even indirectly regulate immigration --

and the Court is hard pressed to come up with any such examples on its

own.  





(14) The Court in De Canas also recognized that because certain

federal legislation pertaining to farm labor contractor registration

explicitly contemplated supplementary and consistent "appropriate

State law and regulation," 7 U.S.C. Section 2051, the INA could "not

be taken as legislation by Congress expressing its judgment to have

uniform federal regulations in matters affecting employment of illegal

aliens, and therefore barring state legislation" such as the statute

at issue. De Canas, 424 U.S. at 361-62. Likewise in this case, the

public benefits scheme in this country is predominantly a cooperative

federal-state effort based on voluntary state participation in

federally-funded public benefits programs such as AFDC, Medicaid and

Food Stamps and the states optional provision of state funded public

benefits not within the federal scheme. Thus, it cannot be said that

the INA was unmistakably intended to preclude states from regulating,

to the extent consistent with federal law, the provision of public

benefits and services.  





(15) 8 U.S.C. Section5 1101(a)(42), 1157. Refugees are persons

determined by the INS to have been persecuted or to have a well

founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality,

membership in a particular social group of political opinion.  





(16) 8 U.S.C. Section 1101(a)(42)(A), 1158. Persons who meet the

statutory definition of refugee are eligible for asylum and may apply

for permanent residency after one year. Asylees are entitled to remain

in the United States on an indefinite basis unless asylee status is

revoked by the INS.  





(17) 8 U.S.C. Section 1253(h). A person is eligible for withholding of

deportation if her "life or freedom would be threatened in [the home]

country on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a

particular social group, or political opinion.  





(18) 8 U.S.C. Section 1182(d)(5). Persons paroled by the INS into the

United States based on humanitarian or public interest considerations

may be authorized for indefinite stays.  





(19) 8 C.F.R. Section 242.6. The spouses and children of aliens

legalized under the Immigration Reform and Control Act's ("IRCA")

amnesty provisions are protected from deportation by family unity

status.  





(20) 8 U.S.C. Section 12S4a. Aliens living in the United States may be

granted temporary protected status where unsafe conditions in their

countries of origin make it a hardship to return.  





(21) 57 Fed. Reg. 28700-28701 (1992). Salvadorans granted DED status

that officially expired at the end of 1994 remain in the United States

with the permission of the INS on the basis of family relationships,

continuing eligibility for work authorization and other grounds.  





(22) 8 V.S.C. Sections 1105a(a)(3) (stay), 1254(a) (suspension). An

alien found deportable and ordered deported by an immigration judge

may be eligible for suspension or stay of deportation for emergent or

humanitarian reasons.  





(23) 8 U.S.C. Section 1154. The Violence Against Women Act of 1994

(Title IV of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of

1994) provides that battered immigrant women and children may become

legalized by self-petition for immediate relative or second preference

status under the INA or by application for suspension of deportation

on the basis of abuse.  





(24) Because all of Section 7 is necessarily preempted by the Supreme

Court's decision in Plyler v. Doe as discussed below, that Section 7's

verification provision does not conflict with federal law cannot save

it from preemption on other grounds.  





(25) 42 U.S.C. Section 1786; 7 C.F.R. S 246 (providing supplemental

food, nutrition, counseling and health care referral for low-income

pregnant women, new mothers, infants and children who are at

"nutritional risk").  





(26) Child welfare services are defined under federal law as public

social services directed toward child well-being, including programs

to protect and promote child welfare generally, to prevent or remedy

neglect, abuse, exploitation and delinquency of children, to restore

children to their families after protective removals and to place

children and assure adequate care in suitable adoptive or other homes.

See 42 U.S.C Section 625. Federal grants are made to qualified state

child welfare service programs. See 42 U.S.C. Sections 601 et seq.; 42

U.S.C. Sections 620 et seq.; 42 U.S.C. Sections 670 et seq.; 42 U.S.C.

Section 5101 (providing emergency response, family reunification and

other benefits and services to children or needy families with

children regardless of immigration status).  





(27) See supra n.26. 





(28) See supra n.26. 





(29) Defendants assert generally that such programs exist. However,

they have not specifically identified any such program.  





(30) 42 U.S.C. Section 291c(e); 42 C.F.R. Section 124.603(a)(1)

(requiring Hill-Burton funding recipient facilities to make services

"available to all persons residing in the territorial area" of the

facilities regardless of immigration status).  





(31) 42 U.S.C. Section 254c; 42 C.F.R. Section 51c.303(v) (federal

grant recipient public and nonprofit private "community health

centers" serving "medically underserved populations" to provide health

care regardless of immigration status).  





(32) 42 U.S.C. Section 1395dd (requiring hospitals that receive

Medicare reimbursements to screen and stabilize emergency patient

regardless of patient's immigration status).  





(33) Subsection (d) of section 6 provides that the term

"publicly-funded health care facility" is to be defined as specified

in Sections 1200 and 1250 of the California Health and Safety Code.

Section 1250 defines "health facility" as:  



any facility, place or building which is organized, maintained, and

operated for the diagnosis, care, prevention, and treatment of human

illness, physical or mental, including convalescence and

rehabilitation and including care during and after pregnancy, or for

any one or more of these puroses, for one or more persons, to which

the persons are admitted for a 24-hour stay or longer . . .  



Cal. Health & Safety Code Section 1250. Section 1200 defines "clinic"

as follows:  



an organized outpatient health facility which provides direct medical,

surgical, dental, optometric, or podiatric advice, services or

treatment to patients who remain less than 24 hours, and which may

also provide diagnostic or therapeutic services to patients in the

home as an incident to care provided at the clinic facility.  



Cal. Health & Safety Code 5 1200. While these sections define "health

care facility," they fail to explain what is intended by the term

"publicly-funded." Under these broad definitions, section 6 must be

construed to apply to all hospitals that receive any "public" funding,

state or federal.  





(34) Plaintiffs also argue that subsection (b) of section 6 conflicts

with EMTALA by delaying the provision of care until the patient's

immigration status is determined. Since subsection (b) is preempted

under both the first and third De Canas tests, this argument merits no

further discussion here.  





(35) Defendants have not identified any wholly state-funded health

care facilities.  





(36) Although plaintiffs did not assert Plyler as a basis for conflict

preemption of-section 7 in their motions for summary judgment, the

Court is nevertheless constrained to consider the irreconcilable

conflict between section 7 And federal law as announced by the Supreme

Court in that case. The Ayala plaintiffs have also alleged that

section 7 directly conflicts with the Individuals With Disabilities

Education Act, 20 U.S.C. Section 1400 et seq. (the "IDEA"), because

the IDEA specifically guarantees a free appropriate public education

to all disabled children, regardless of immigration status. Since the

Court finds here that section 7 is preempted in its entirety as

applied to all children, this separate ground for summary judgment

need not be considered.  





(37) In finding the state's reasons for attempting to withhold public

education from undocumented children constitutionally "insubstantial,"

the Supreme Court in Plyler was particularly concerned with the state

statute because it was directed at children, persons the Court deemed

"special members" of the "underclass" of undocumented Aliens present

in this country. Plyler, 457 U.S. at 219. Distinguishing undocumented

children, who are capable of affecting "'neither their parents'

conduct nor their own status,'" from their adult parents, who are

willingly present in violation of federal immigration laws, the Court

concluded that it is "difficult to conceive of a rational

justification for penalizing these children for their presence within

the United States." Id. at 219-220 (citing Trimble v. Gordon, 430 U.S.

762, 770 (1977)). While "[p]ersuasive arguments support the view that

a State may withhold its beneficence from those whose very presence

within the United States is the product of their own unlawful

conduct," the "arguments do not apply with the same force to

classifications imposing disabilities on the minor children of such

illegal entrants." Id. Recognizing the costs the state statute imposed

on "the innocent children who [were] its victims, the Court concluded

that the statute failed equal protection scrutiny, despite the fact

that classifications based on undocumented alien status are not

suspect and education is not a fundamental right, because it failed to

further "some substantial goal of the State." Id. at 224. The Supreme

Court's reasoning and ruling in Plyler appears to compel a finding

that section 6's denial of health care services, as applied to

undocumented children, is equally without "rational justification" and

offensive to the principles of equal protection. Id. at 220. Although

the Court declines at this time to rule on this extension of Plyler,

it does note that section 6, to the extent it denies health care

services to undocumented children, appears to be in direct conflict

with federal law.  





(38) Because severing section 7 in its entirety does not impede the

functioning of the remainder of the initiative, does not render the

remainder unintelligible, and cannot be said to be so crucial to the

passage of the initiative that the initiative would have failed in its

absence, section 7 is functionally, grammatically, and volitionally

severable from the remaining sections.  





(39) See 8 U.S.C. Section 1306(d) (false alien registration cards); 18

U.S.C. Sections 1424, 1425 (false papers in naturalization

proceedings); 18 U.S.C. Section 1028 (production, possession or use of

false identification documents); 18 U.S.C. Section 1426 (false

naturalization, citizenship or alien registration papers); 18 U.S.C.

Sections 1542-1543 (forgery or false use of passport); 18 U.S.C.

Section 1544 (misuse of passport); 18 U.S.C. Section 1546 (fraud and

misuse of visas); 18 U.S.C. Section 911 (false claim to citizenship).

KAYE, CHIEF JUDGE:

Under the New York adoption statute, a single person can
adopt a child (Domestic Relations Law  110).  Equally clear is
the right of a single homosexual to adopt (see 18 NYCRR
421.16[h][2]  [qualified adoption agencies "shall not * * *
reject[]  [adoption petitions] solely on the basis of
homosexuality"]).  These appeals call upon us to decide if the
unmarried partner of a child's biological mother, whether
heterosexual or homosexual, who is raising the child together
with the biological parent, can become the child's second parent
by means of adoption.

Because the two adoptions sought--one by an unmarried
heterosexual couple, the other by the lesbian partner of the
child's mother--are fully consistent with the adoption statute,
we answer this question in the affirmative.  To rule otherwise
would mean that the thousands of New York children actually being
raised in homes headed by two unmarried persons could have only
one legal parent, not the two who want them.
The Adoptions Souqht

In Matter of Jacob, Roseanne M.A. and Jacob's biological
father (from whom she is divorced) separated prior to the child's
birth and Roseanne M.A. was awarded sole custody.  Jacob was a
year old when Stephen T.K. began living with him and his mother
in early 1991.  At the time of filing the joint petition for
adoption three years later, Stephen T.K. was employed as a
programmer/analyst with an annual income of $50,000, while
Roseanne M.A. was a student at SUNY Health Center.  Jacob's
biological father consented to the adoption.

Though acknowledging that "the granting of an adoption in
this matter may be beneficial to Jacob," Family Court dismissed
the petition for lack of standing on the ground that Domestic
Relations Law  110 does not authorize adoptions by an unmarried
couple.  The Appellate Division affirmed, two Justices dissenting
(210 AD2d 876), and an appeal to this Court was taken as of
right.

In Matter of Dana, appellants are G.M. and her lesbian
partner, P.I., who have lived together in what is described as a
long and close relationship for the past 19 years.  G.M. works as
a special education teacher in the public schools earning $38,000
annually and P.I., employed at an athletic club, has an annual
income of $48,000.  In 1989, the two women decided that P.I.
would have a child they would raise together.  P. I. was
artificially inseminated by an anonymous donor, and on June 6,
1990, she gave birth to Dana.  G.M. and P.I. have shared
parenting responsibilities since Dana's birth and have arranged
their separate work schedules around her needs.  With P.I.'s
consent, G.M. filed a petition to adopt Dana in April 1993.

In the court-ordered report recommending that G.M. be
permitted to adopt (see Domestic Relations Law  116), the
disinterested investigator described Dana as an attractive,
sturdy and articulate little girl with a "rich family life,"
which includes frequent visits with G.M.'s three grown children
from a previous marriage "who all love Dana and accept her as
their baby sister."  Noting that G.M. "only has the best interest
of Dana in mind," the report concluded that she "provides her
with a family structure in which to grow and flourish."

As in Matter of Jacob, Family Court, while conceding the
favorable results of the home study and "in no way disparaging
the ability of [G.M.] to be a good, nurturing and loving parent,"
denied the petition for lack of standing.  In addition, the court
held that the adoption was further prohibited by Domestic
Relations Law  117 which it interpreted to require the automatic
termination of P.I.'s relationship with Dana upon an adoption by
G.M.  Despite its conclusion that G.M. had standing to adopt, the
Appellate Division nevertheless affirmed on the ground that
Domestic Relations Law  117 prohibits the adoption (209 AD2d 8).
We granted leave to appeal.

Limiting our analysis, as did the courts below, to the
preserved statutory interpretation issues, we conclude that
appellants have standing to adopt under Domestic Relations Law
110 and are not foreclosed from doing so by Domestic Relations
Law  117.  There being no statutory preclusion, we now reverse
the order of the Appellate Division in each case and remit the
matter to Family Court for a factual evaluation and determination
as to whether these adoptions would be in the best interest of
the children.
The Context of our Statutory Analysis

 Two basic themes of overarching significance set the
context of our statutory analysis.
the creature of statute" (Matter of Eaton, 305 NY 162,
165), the adoption statute must be strictly construed.  What is
to be construed strictly and applied rigorously in this sensitive
area of the law, however, is legislative purpose as well as
legislative language.  Thus, the adoption statute must be applied
in harmony with the humanitarian principle that adoption is a
means of securing the best possible home for a child (see Matter
of Malpica-Orsini, 36 NY2d 568, 571-572).

Ten years ago, in Matter of Robert Paul P. (63 NY2d 233), we
refused to allow the adoption of a 50-year-old man by his 57-
year-old homosexual partner even though the statutory language
permitted the adoption.  Our refusal in Robert Paul P. rested
solely on the fact that the adult adoption sought in that case
would have been "wholly inconsistent with the underlying public
policy of providing a parent-child relationship for the welfare
of the child" (id. at 236).

The very next year, in Matter of Best (66 NY2d 151), we
again chose not to construe the words of the adoption statute
strictly, declining to permit an adopted child to inherit under
the will of his biological grandmother because "[p]owerful policy
considerations militate against construing a class gift to
include a child adopted out of the family" (id. at 155).  One
commentator has characterized our decision in Best as "in
defiance of * * * the text of the Domestic Relations Law
yet in accordance with current societal views of adoption and the
adoptive relationship" (Note, When Blood Isn't Thicker Than
Water: The Inheritance Rights of Adopted-Out Children in New
York, 53 Brooklyn L Rev 1007, 1007).

What Matter of Robert Paul P. and Matter of Best underscore
is that in strictly construing the adoption statute, our primary
loyalty must be to the statute's legislative purpose--the child's
best interest.  "The adoptive family arises out of the State's
concern for the best interests of the child" (People ex rel.
Sibley v Sheppard. 54 NY2d 320, 327).  This profound concern for
the child's welfare is reflected in the statutory language
itself:  when "satisfied that the best interests of the
child will be promoted thereby," a court "shall make an
order approving the adoption * * * " (Domestic Relations Law
Section 114 [emphasis added]).

This policy would certainly be advanced in situations like
those presented here by allowing the two adults who actually
function as a child's parents to become the child's legal
parents.  The advantages which would result from such an adoption
include social security and life insurance benefits in the event
of a parent's death or disability, the right to sue for the
wrongful death of a parent, the right to inherit under rules of
intestacy tsee In re TammY, 619 NE2d 315, 320) and eligibility
for coverage under both parents' health insurance policies.  In
addition, granting a second-parent adoption further ensures that
two adults are legally entitled to make medical decisions for the
child in case of emergency and are under a legal obligation for
the child's economic support (see Domestic Relations Law  32).

Even more important, however, is the emot onal security of
knowing that in the event of the biological parent's death or
disability, the other parent will have presumptive custody, and
the children's relationship with their parents, siblings and
other relatives will continue should the co-parents separate.
Indeed, viewed from the children's perspective, permitting the
adoptions allows the children to achieve a measure of permanency
with both parent figures and avoids the sort of disruptive
visitation battle we faced in Matter of Alison D. v. Virginia M.
(see 77 NY2d 651, 656 ["Petitioner concedes she is not the
child's 'parent'  * * * by virtue of an adoption."]).

A second, related point of overriding significance is that
the various sections comprising New York's adoption statute today
represent a complex and not entirely reconcilable patchwork.
Amended innumerable times since its passage in 1873, the adoption
statute was last consolidated nearly 60 years ago, in 1938 (L
1938, ch 606).  Thus, after decades of piecemeal amendment upon
amendment, the statute today contains language from the 1870's
alongside language from the 1990's.

  Though courts surely must, and do, strive to give effect to
every word of a statute, our analysis must recognize the
difficulty--perhaps unique difficulty--of such an endeavor here.
With its long, tortuous history, New York's adoption statute
today is a far cry from a "methodical[] and meticulous[]"
expression of legislative judgment (dissent, p. 23).  That the
questions posed by these appeals are not readily answerable by
reference to the words cf a particular section of the law, but
instead require the traditional and often close and difficult
task of statutory interpretation is evident even in the length of
today's Opinions--whichever result is reached.

  Against this backdrop, we turn to the particular provisions
at issue.[fn 1]
Domestic Relations Law Section 110

Despite ambiguity in other sections, one thing is clear:
section 110 allows appellants to become adoptive parents.
Domestic Relations Law  110, entitled "Who May Adopt," provides
that an "adult unmarried person or an adult husband and his adult
wife together may adopt another person" (Domestic Relations Law
 110).  Under this language, both appellant G.M. in Matter of
Dana and appellant Stephen T.K. in Matter of Jacob, as adult
unmarried persons, have standing to adopt and appellants are
correct that the Court's analysis of section 110 could
appropriately end here.[fn 2]

Endowing the word "together" as used in section 110 with the
overpowering significance of enforcing a policy in favor of
marriage (as the dissent does) would require us to rewrite the
statute.  The statute uses the word "together" only to describe
married persons and thus does not preclude an unmarried person in
a relationship with another unmarried person from adopting.
Rather, by insisting on the joint consent of the married persons,
the statutory term "together" simply insures that one spouse
cannot adopt a child without the other spouse's knowledge or over
the other's objection (see L 1984, ch 228, Memorandum of State
Department of Social Services at 3184).  Since each of the
biological mothers here is not only aware of these proceedings,
but has expressly consented to the adoptions, section 110 poses
no statutory impediment.[fn 3]

The conclusion that appellants have standing to adopt is
also supported by the history of section 110.  The pattern of
amendments since the end of World War II evidences a successive
expansion of the categories of persons entitled to adopt
regardless of their marital status or sexual orientation.  The
language in section 110 permitting adoptions by +an adult or
minor husband and his wife or minor wife together," for example,
is the result of 1951 legislation intended to enlarge the class
of potential adoptive parents to include minors (L 1951, ch 211,
Memorandum of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York,
Committee on State Legislation at 119; 1943 Op Atty Gen 260).
The sponsors of the bill, passed during the Korean War, were
concerned that the child of a young father drafted into the
military would be unable to take his father's surname (L 1951, ch
211, Memorandum of the Legal Aid Society at 9).

 Another illustration of such expansion is the 1984 amendment
increasing the number of potential adoptive parents by permitting
adoption by adults not yet divorced but living apart from their
spouses pursuant to separation agreements.  Supporting that
amendment was New York's "strong policy of assuring that as many
children as possible are adopted into suitable family situations+
(L 1984, ch 218, Memorandum of Department of Social Services,
June 18, 1984 at 2).  As explained, the amendment
would further this policy by requiring prospective
adoptive parents to be evaluated on the basis of their
ability to provide a permanent home and not on their
marital s1atus alone.   [T]he marital status of a person
should have no predetermined effect on the ability of
that person to provide appropriate care to an adopted
child
(id.).

 Consistent with this trend, the latest amendment to Domestic
Relations Law  110 further increased the number of potential
adoptive parents by permitting adoptions by non-divorced adults
who have lived apart from their spouses for eighteen months (L
1992, ch 254).

These amendments reflect some of the fundamental changes
that have taken place in the make-up of the family.  Today, for
example, at least 1.2 of the 3.5 million American households
which consist of an unmarried adult couple have children under 15
years old, more than a six-fold increase from 1970 (see Current
Population Reports, Population Characteristics, US Bur of Census,
Marital Status & Living Arrangements, P20-478 at IX [1993]).  Yet
further recognition of this transformation is evidenced by the
fact that unlike the states of New Hampshire and Florida (NH Rev
Stat Ann  170-B:4; Fla Stat Ann  63.042[3]), New York does not
prohibit adoption by homosexuals.  Indeed, as noted earlier, an
administrative regulation is in place in this State forbidding
the denial of an agency adoption based solely on the petitioner's
sexual orientation (18 NYCRR  421.16[h][2]).

A reading of section 110 granting appellants, as unmarried
second parents, standing to adopt is therefore consistent with
the words of the statute as well as the spirit behind the modern-
day amendments:  encouraging the adoption of as many children as
possible regardless of the sexual orientation or marital status
of the individuals seeking to adopt them.
Domestic Relations Law Section 117

Appellants having standing to adopt pursuant to Domestic
Relations Law  110, the other statutory obstacle relied upon by
the lower courts in denying the petitions is the provision that
"[a]fter the making of an order of adoption the natural parents
of the adoptive child shall be relieved of all parental duties
toward and of all responsibilities for and shall have no rights
over such adoptive child or to his property by descent or
succession * * * " (Domestic Relations Law  117[1][a]).  Literal
application of this language would effectively prevent these
adoptions since it would require the termination of the
biological mothers' rights upon adoption thereby placing
appellants in the "Catch-22" of having to choose one of two co-
parents as the child's only legal parent.

As outlined below, however, neither the language nor policy
underlying section 117 dictates that result.

The Language of Section 117.  Both the title of section 117
("Effect of Adoption") and its opening phrase ("After the making
of an order of adoption") suggest that the section has nothing to
do with the standing of an individual to adopt, an issue treated
exclusively in section 110 (see pp. 9-12, suPra).  Rather,
section 117 addresses the legal effect of an adoption on the
parties and their property.

Also plain on the face of section 117 is that it speaks
principally of estate law.  Words such as "succession,
"inheritance," "decedent," "instrument" and "will" permeate the
statute.  Read contextually, it is clear that the Legislature'S
chief concern in section 117 was the resolution of property
disputes upon the death of an adoptive parent or child.  As we
observed in People ex rel. Sibley v Sheppard (54 NY2d 320
supra), where we declined to read section 117's termination
language "overbroadly [to] interfere with the court's
ability to protect the best interest of the child" and thereby
prohibit visits with the child+s biological grandparents, the
"bulk of the statute refers to intestacy and succession" (54 NY2d
at 325).  Thus, from the very beginning of what is now section
117, both the scholarly commentary about the section and its
dozen or so amendments have centered on issues of property rights
and inheritance (see, e.q., L 1896, ch 272  64 [terminating
right of biological parents to inherit from child, while allowing
child to inherit from biological parents]; Intestate Succession
and the Adopted Child, 1963 NY Leg Doc No.1.2C; Judicial
Limitations on the Riqhts of Adopted Children to Inherit from
Their Natural Relatives as Issue, 60 St. John's L Rev 329
[1986]).

 It is of course true that this Court, in a 1937 case
rejecting claims for support brought by a destitute adopted adult
daughter against her biological father, interpreted the then-
applicable version of section 117 as "mak[ing] the adopted child
the natural child of the adoptive parent [and] reliev[ing] that
natural parent from any responsibility for his child's support"
(Betz v Horr, 276 NY 83, 88-89).  The version of section 117 in
effect at that time, however, did not contain current subsection
(l)(i), which, on its face, appears to limit the applicability of
the entire first half of section 117--including the language
concerning termination in subsection (l)(a)--"only to the
intestate descent and distribution of real and personal propertY"
(Domestic Relations Law  117[1][a]  [emphasis added]).

Obviously, one cannot invoke the termination language in
subparagraph (l)(a) in its most literal sense and at the same
time reject a literal application of the above-quoted language in
subparagraph (l)(i).  A strict construction of the entire section
would lead to the incongruous result that the termination
language of subparagraph (l)(a) is relevant only when there is a
dispute as to intestate succession.

Significantly, the language in subsection (l)(i) was added
only recently (L 1986, ch 407), after the promulgation of the
regulations providing that neither marital status nor sexual
orientation may alone be determinative in an adoption proceeding
(18 NYCRR 421.16[h][2]).  In recommending passage of the 1986
amendment, the Law Revision Commission warned that:
In distinguishing between various classes of adopted-out
children, the Commission must base different treatment of
some children on factors which do not result in
discrimination against certain classes of persons (e.g.,
nonmarital children, unwed parents, males, females) in a
manner impermissible under the Equal Protection Clause *
of the United States * * * or * * * New York State
Constitution
(L 1986, ch 408, Memorandum of Law Revision Commission at 2581-
2582).  This admonition indicates a concern that an unduly
restrictive reading of section 117 could have the discriminatory
and unintended effect of making unwarranted, detrimental
distinctions between "nonmarital children" like the two children
here and those children whose parents are married.
Given this warning, as well as the anomaly created by an
unnecessarily literal reading of the statute, we conclude that
neither subparagraph (l)(a) nor subparagraph (l)(i) was intended
to have universal application.
Recent Statutory Amendments.  Moving beyond the language and
history of section 117 itself, our reading of the statute is
further supported by recent amendments to other sections of the
adoption law which provide elaborate procedural mechanisms for
regulating the relationships between the child, the child's
(soon-to-be former) biological parents and the persons who will
become the child's parents upon adoption (see Social Services Law
Section 383-c; Domestic Relations Law  115-b).

In the context of agency adoptions, Social Services Law
 383-c, enacted in 1990 (L 1990, ch 479; L 1990, ch 480),
provides that biological parents willing to give their child up
for adoption must execute a written instrument, known as a
"surrender," stating "in conspicuous bold print on the first
page" that "the parent is giving up all rights to have custody,
visit with, write to or learn about the child, forever
(Social Services Law  383-c[5][b][ii]).

The second category of adoption--private placement--is also
regulated by a newly revised statute (L 1986, ch 817) requiring
the execution of a written "consent" stating that +no
action * * * may be maintained * * * for the custody of the
child" (Domestic Relations Law  115-b[1]).  In fact, the
procedure mandated by Domestic Relations Law  115-b closely
parallels that of Social Services Law  383-c.  Both statutes,
for example, require biological parents to execute a document
that effectively terminates parental rights.  Both provisions
require a Judge or Surrogate (if the document is executed in
court) to inform the biological parents of the consequences of
their act, and advise them of their right to be represented by
counsel (Social Services Law  383-c[5][b]; Domestic Relations
Law  115-b[2][b]).  More importantly, both statutes provide that
the biological parents' "surrender" or "consent" may be revoked
within 45 days, and that an adoption proceeding may not be
commenced until after the expiration of that period (Social
Services Law  383-c[8][b]; Domestic Relations Law  115-
b[4][c]).  Thus, by the time the adoptive parents become the
child's legal parents, the biological parents have already
formally agreed to relinquish their relationship with the child.
The procedural safeguards contained in Social Services Law
 383-c and Domestic Relations Law  115-b--safeguards that
reflect modern sensitivities as to the level of procedural
protection required for waiver of parental rights--further
indicate that section 117 does not invariably mandate termination
in all circumstances.  Under the language of section 117 alone, a
biological mother's rights could theoretically be severed
unilaterally, without notice as to the consequences or other
procedural protections.  Though arguably adequate in 1938 when
the statute was enacted (L 1938, ch 606,  1; cf. Matter of
Bistany, 239 NY 19 [Cardozo, J.]), such a summary procedure would
be unlikely to pass muster today (see, e.g., Santosky v. Kramer,
455 US 745, 768-770; Matter of Sarah K., 66 NY2d 223, 237).
The above-described amendments to  Social Services Law
 383-c and Domestic Relations Law  115-b suggest that the
Legislature in recent years has devised statutory vehicles other
than section 117 to carefully regulate and restrict parental
rights during the adoption process, again militating against a
rigid application of subparagraph (l)(a).

The Ambiquity Should Be Resolved in the Children's Favor.
Finally, even though the language of section 117 still has the
effect of terminating a biological parent's rights in the
majority of adoptions between strangers--where there is a need to
prevent unwanted intrusion by the child's former biological
relatives to promote the stability of the new adoptive family--
the cases before us are entirely different.  As we recognized in
Matter of Seaman (78 NY2d 451, 461), "complete severance of the
natural relationship [is] not necessary when the adopted person
remain[s] within the natural family unit as a result of an
intrafamily adoption."

One example of an adoption where the Legislature has
explicitly acknowledged that termination is unwarranted is when
the child, with the consent of the biological parent, is adopted
by a "stepparent" (Domestic Relations Law  117[1][d]).  A
second, implicit exception occurs in the adoptions by teenage
fathers authorized by the 1951 amendm,ent to section 110 (see pp.
10-11 supra).  Since minor fathers adopting their own biological
children are not "stepparents" under the language of Domestic
Relations Law  117(1)(d), they would be prohibited from adopting
were section 117's termination language to be mandatory in all
cases.  The seemingly automatic cut-off language of section 117
could not have been intended to bar these adoptions, however,
since they are precisely what the Legislature sought to encourage
in the first place.

Yet a third class of adoptions where complete termination of
parental rights appears to be contrary to legislative intent are
those adoptions contemplated by Socia] Services Law  383-c, a
completely new statute enacted five years ago.  Specifically, New
York law now allows the parties to an agency adoption to "agree
to different terms" as to the nature of the biological parents'
post-adoptive relationship with the child.  The statute thus
expressly permits parties to agree that the biological parent
will retain specified rights--such as visitation with the child--
after the adoption, t,-  eby authorizing "open adoptions" for the
first time in this State (see Carrieri, Supp Practice
Commentaries, McKinney's Cons Laws of NY, Book 52A, Social
Services Law  383-c, 1995 Pocket Part; at 69).

A year prior to the enactment of Social Services Law
 383-c, this Court declined to sanction the concept of "open
adoption'l because of our belief that it was inconsistent with
what we perceived to be section 117's requirement that
termination of parental rights was mandatory in all cases (Matter
of GreqorY B., 74 NY2d 77, 91 [citations omitted]).
Significantly, when enacting Social Services Law  383-c the very
next year, the Legislature saw no need to amend Domestic
Relations Law  117.  Again, if section 117 automatically
terminated parental rights in all circumstances, it would have
the practical effect of overriding the conditional
surrender/"open adoption" provisions of Social Services Law
 383-c.  By passing Social Services Law  383-c as it did, the
Legislature thus necessarily rejected the reading of section 117
articulated in Matter of GreqorY B.  (see People ex rel. SibleY v
Sheppard, 54 NY2d 320, 325).

Given the above, it is plain that an interpretation of
section 117 that would limit the number of beneficial intrafamily
adoptions cannot be reconciled with the legislative intent to
authorize open adoptions and adoptions by minors.  The co-
existence of the statute's seemingly automatic termination
language along with these more recent enactments creates a
statutory puzzle not susceptible of ready resolution.

One conclusion that can be drawn, however, is that section
117 does not invariably require termination in the situation
where the biological parent, having co -ented to the adoption,
has agreed to retain parental rights and to raise the child
together with the second parent.  Despite their varying factual
circumstances, each of the adoptions described above--stepparent
adoptions, adoptions by minor fathers and open adoptions--share
such an agreement as a common denominator.  Because the facts of
the cases before us are directly analogous to these three
situations, the half-century old termination language of section
117 should not be read to preclude the adoptions here.  Phrased
slightly differently, "the desire for consistency in the law
should not of itself sever the bonds between the child and the
n tural relativesll (People ex rel. SibleY v Sheppard, 54 NY2d
320, 326).[fn 4]

"When the language of a statute is susceptible of two
constructions, the courts will adopt that which avoids injustice,
hardship, constitutional doubts or other objectionable results"
(Kauffman & Sons Saddlery Co. v Miller, 298 NY 38, 44 [Fuld, J.];
see also McKinney's Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes  150).
Given that section 117 is open to two differing interpretations
as to whether it automatically terminates parental rights in all
cases, a construction of the section that would deny children
like Jacob and Dana the opportunity of having their two de facto
parents become their legal parents, based solely on their
biological mother's sexual orientation or marital status, would
not only be unjust under the circumstances, but also might rais_
constitutional concerns in light of the adoption statute's
historically consistent purpose--the best interests of the child.
(See, e.g., Gomez v Perez, 409 US 535, 538 [equal protection
clause prevents unequal treatment of children whose parents are
unmarried]; PlYler v Doe, 457 US 202, 220 [State may not direct
the onus of parent's perceived "misconduct against his (or her)
children"]; Matter of Burns v Miller Constr., 55 NY2d 501, 507-
510 [New York statute requiring child born out of wedlock to
prove ''acknowledgmentll by deceased parent did not further
legitimate State interest]; see also Matter of Best, 66 NY2d 151,
160 n4).[fn 5]

These concerns are particularly weighty in Matter of Dana.
Even if the Court were to rule against him on this appeal, the
male petitioner in Matter of Jacob could still adopt by marrying
Jacob's mother.  Dana, however, would be irrevocably deprived of
the benefits and entitlements of having as her legal parents the
two individuals who have already assumed that role in her life,
simply as a consequence of her mother's sexual orientation.

 Any proffered justification for rejecting these petitions
based on a governmental policy disapproving of homosexuality or
encouraging marriage would not apply.  As noted above, New York
has not adopted a policy disfavoring adoption by either single
persons or homosexuals.  In fact, the most recent legislative
document relating to the subject urges courts to construe section
117 in precisely the manner we have as it cautions against
discrimination against "nonmarital children" and "unwed parents"
(see p. 16 suPra).  An interpretation of the statute that avoids
such discrimination or hardship is all the more appropriate here
where a contrary ruling could jeopardize the legal status of the
many New York children whose adoptions by second parents have
already taken place (e.a., Matter of Camilla, 163 Misc 2d 272;
Matter of Evan, 153 Misc 2d 844; Matter of A.J.J., 108 Misc 2d
657).
Conclusion

To be sure, the Legislature that last codified section 117
in 1938 may never have envisioned families that "include[] two
adult lifetime partners whose relationship * * * is characterized
by an emotional and financial commitment and interdependence"
(Braschi v Stahl Assocs. Co., 74 NY2d 201, 210).  Nonetheless, it
is clear that section 117, designed as a shield to protect new
adoptive families, was never intended as a sword to prohibit
otherwise beneficial intrafamily adoptions by second parents.

Accordingly, in each proceeding, the order of the Appellate
Division should be reversed, without costs, the adoption petition
reinstated and the matter remitted to Family Court for further
proceedings consistent with this Opinion.
======================================
#195 - Matter or Jacob
#196 - Matter of Dana
BELLACOSA, J. (dissenting):


 Judges Simons, Titone and I respectfully dissent and vote
to affirm in each case.


 These appeals share a statutory construction issue under
New York's adoption laws.  While the results reached by the
Majority are intended to have a benevolent effect on the
individuals involved in these two cases, the means to those ends
transform the legislative adoption charter governing countless
other individuals.  Additionally, the dispositional methodology
transcends institutional limitations on this Court's proper
exercise of its authority, fixed by internal discipline and by the
external distribution of powers among the branches of government.


 The Majority minimizes the at-will relationships of the
appellants-couples who would be combined biological-adoptive
parents in each case, but the significant statutory and legally
central relevancy is inescapable.  Unlike married and single parent
households, each couple here cohabits only day-to-day, no matter
the depth or length of their voluntary arrangements.  Their
relationships lack legal permanency and the State has not endowed
them with the benefits and enforceable protections that flow from
relationships recognized under color of law.  Nowhere do statutes,
or any case law previously, recognize de facto, functional or
second parent adoptions in joint circumstances as presented here.


 Specifically, in the respective cases, the availability
of adoption is implicated because of the operation-of-law
consequences under Domestic Relations Law 117 based on: (l) the
relationship of the biological parent and the putative adoptive
child if a male and female unmarried cohabitinq couple, one of whom
is the biological mother of the child, jointly petitions to adopt
the five-year-old child; and (2) the relationship of the biological
parent and her child if the lesbian partner of the biological
mother petitions alone to adopt the five-year-old child.  Neither
case presents an issue of ineligibility because of sexual
orientation or of discrimination against adoption on that basis,
despite the Majority's evocations in that regard.


 The facts are uncontested and pertinently recited in the
Chief Judge's Opinion.  In Matter of Jacob, Family Court, Oneida
County, dismissed the petition on the ground that the petitioners
are an unmarried couple.  No best interests factual or evidentiary
evaluations were undertaken.  The court held that adoption
proceedings are creatures of statute and that Domestic Relations
Law 110 does not authorize adoption by an unmarried couple.  The
Appellate Division, Fourth Department, affirmed (210 AD2d 876),
concluding that the statute did not permit adoption by two
unmarried persons together.


 In Matter of Dana, Family Court, Putnam County, denied
the adoption petition.  The court held that (1) G.M. did not have
standing to adopt pursuant to Domestic Relations Law 110, since
she did "not fall within any of the classifications under Domestic


 The judicial role is most sensitive, but no case has ever
recognized a judicially created right of adoption.  This restraint
is especially pertinent when the Legislature has expressly enacted
a plenary, detailed legislative plan (see, Matter of Malpica-
Orsini, supra, at 570; Matter of Eaton, 305 NY 162, 165).  The
Majority acknowledges New York's unique legislative developments
and the several major cases in which adoptions have been disallowed
(see, e.q., Matter of Robert Paul P., supra) that together document
these juridically limiting principles, yet the Majority's ruling
and result paradoxically turn away from those consistent
guideposts.


 Pointedly, this Court's unqualified utterance is that
"[t]he Legislature has supreme control of the subiect" (Matter of
Robert Paul P., supra, at 237 [emphasis added]; see also, Matter of
Malpica-Orsini, supra).  A transcendent societal goal in the field
of domestic relations is to stabilize family relationships,
particularly parent-child bonds.  That State interest promotes
permanency planning and provides protection for an adopted child's
legally secure familial placement.  Therefore, statutory
authorizations should not be substantively transformed under the
guise of interpretation, and all facets of the adoption statutes
should be harmonized (see, Matter of Costello v Geiser, 85 NY2d
103, 109; Heard v Cuomo, 80 NY2d 684, 689; Matter of Long v
Adirondack Park Aqency, 76 NY2d 416, 420, 422-423).


 Notably, too, for contextual understanding of these
cases, New York State has long refused to recognize common law
Preclusion or prohibition, however, are not the point.
Petitioners' burden, ignored by the Majority, is to identify a
source of statutory authorization.



 Petitioners came to court in the Jacob case to adopt
"together," as two unmarried adults.  The court must deal with them
as they presented themselves and must also obey the statute that on
its face allows a joint petition by "married" spouses "together."
The statute unambiguously declares that "[a]n adult unmarried
person or an adult husband and his wife together may adopt another
person" (Domestic Relations Law 110 [emphasis added]; Scheinkman,
Practice Commentaries, McKinney's Cons Laws of NY, Book 14,
Domestic Relations Law 110, at 398, 402, 404).  Words of such
precise import and limitation are not merely talismanic and may not
be rendered superfluous, as the Majority has done here.  The
Legislature's chosen words must be given their substantive,
intended meaning, and interpretation is no substitute for its
failure to be more explicit or flexible.


 The statutory language and its history instructively
reveal no legislative intent or hint to extend the right and
responsibility of adoption to cohabiting unmarried adults (see,
Scheinkman, Supp Practice Commentaries, McKinney's Cons Laws of NY,
Book 14, Domestic Relations Law 110, 1995 Pocket Part, at 85).
The opposite obtains, notably in the Jacob case, in the direct
contraindication of Domestic Relations Law 11 expressing the
State's longstanding public policy refusal to recognize at-will
common law relationships as marriages.  Confusion is thus sown by
the holdings today by blurriny plain meaning words and clear lines
between relationships that are legally recognized and those that
are not.  Under the newly-fashioned theory rooted in ambiguity, any
number of people who choose to live together -- even those who may
not cohabit -- could be allowed to adopt a child together.  The
result in these cases and reductio ad absurdum illustrations
flowing from appellants+ theorem -- that sinyular may mean plural
and vice versa under a general axiom of statutory construction
inapplicable in the face of specificity -- are far beyond any
discernible legislative intent of New York lawmakers.  Marriages
and single parent households are not, after all, mere social
conventions generally or with respect to acception circumstances;
they enjoy legal recognition and special protections for
empirically proper social reasons and public policies.


 The legislative history of adoption laws over the last
century also reveals a dynamic process with an evolving set of
limitations.  The original version enacted in 1873 provided: "Any
minor child may be adopted by any adult" (L 1873, ch 830 [emphasis
added]).  In 1896, the Legislature cut back by stating that "[a]n
adult unmarried perso . or an adult husband or wife, or an adult
husband and his adult wife together, may adopt a minor" (L 1896, ch
272; see also, L 1915, ch 352; L 1917, ch 149).  This language was
further restricted, in 1920, when the Legislature omitted from the
statute the language "or an adult husband or wife" (see, L 1920, ch
433).  Since enactment of the 1920 amendment, the statute has
provided that "an adult unmarried person or an adult husband and
his wife toqether may adopt" (Domestic Relations Law 110 [emphasis
added]).  The words chosen by the Legislature demonstrate its
conclusion that a stable familial entity is provided by either a
one-parent family or a two-parent family when the concentric
interrelationships enjoy a legal bond.  The statute demonstrates
that the Legislature, by express will and words, concluded that
households that lack legally recognized bonds suffer a relatively
greater risk to the stability needed for adopted children and
families, because individuals can walk out of these relationships
with impunity and unknown legal consequences.


 Next, the Legislature specified the exceptions in section
110 permitting a married individual to petition for adoption
without consent of the other spouse (see, Domestic Relations Law
110; McKinney's Cons Laws of New York, Book 1, Statutes, 240
[expressio unius est exclusio alterius -- where a statute mentions
certain exceptions and omits others, the Legislature intends that
the omitted items should be excluded]; Matter of Alonzo M. v
New York City Dept. of Probation, 72 NY2d 662, 665; Patrolmen's
Benevolent Assn. of City of N.Y. v CitY of New York, 41 NY2d 205,
208-209).  The failure of the Legislature to provide for the
circumstances of these two cases examined in the light of
successive particularized legislative amendatory actions, is yet
another cogent refutation of the uniquely judicial authorization of
adoption, unfurled today under the twin banners of statutory
interpretation and ambiquity.

 Lastly in this connection, we derive a diametrically
different lesson from Matter of Alison D. v Virqinia M. (77 NY2nd
651), decided in 1991.  The Majority for that case held that a
lesbian partner is not a "parent" under Domestic Relations Law
70(a).  The Court expressly rejected an expansionist judicial
definition of "de facto parent" or "functional" family (id., at
656) and declined to enlarge legislatively limited delineations
(id., at 657).  Yet, today's Majority, only four years later,
revives and applies that rejected de facto methodology using
another nonstatutory, undelineated term, "second parent adoption"
(compare, Simpson v Loehmann, 21 NY2d 305, 314-316 [Breitel, J.,
concurring] ["Only a major reappraisal by the court, rather than
the accident of a change in its composition, would justify the
overruling of" precedent]).  The Majority now grants legal
recognition to what it refers to as functional parents in both
cases, the couples comprised of two individuals bound together
solely by personally elective affiliation, not by marriage as the
statute prescribes.  This turnabout should be contrasted again with
what the Court in Alison D. actually did:  it took a statute at its
precise words and gave them effect, because the legally recognized
stability of these most sacred human relationships were determined
to be paramount by the Legislature and, thus, by this Court.


 When the Majority augments extant legislation in these
cases because the corpus juris does not reflect modern arrangements
in which individuals nevertheless yearn to be accorded family
status under the law (compare, Matter of Alison D. v Virqinia M.
supra), it significantly dissolves the central rationale of Alison
D. (id.; see also, Simpson v Loehmann, 21 NY2d 305, 314-316, supra
[Breitel, J., ConCurring]).  AS former Chief Judge Breitel noted in
another connection, the "judicial process is not permitted to rove
generally over the scene of human affairs.  Instead, it must be
used, on pain of violating the proprieties, within the framework of
a highly disciplined special system of legal rules characteristic
of the legal order" (Breitel, The Lawmakers, 65 Colum L Rev 749,
772; see also, Benjamin N. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial
Process, reprinted in Selected Writinqs of Benjamin Nathan Cardozo,
110, 164 [Hall ed, 1947] [A judge "is not a knight-errant, roaming
at will in pursuit of his {or her} own ideal of beauty or of
goodness."]).  The rulings today constitute a rejection of such
wise admonitions about appropriate limitations on the judicial
process and power.


 The Per Curiam opinion of the Court in Matter of Alison
D. v Virqinia M. (77 NY2d 651, supra) also instructively refrained
from any reliance on or reference to Braschi v Stahl Assocs. Co.
(74 NY2d 201).  Thus, the incorporation of Braschi into the instant
cases is inapposite and should be unavailing, because these are
very different cases with very different issues and operative
policies.








II


 A key societal concern in adoption proceedings is, we all
agree, the best interests of children (see, Domestic Relations Law
114; Matter of Robert Paul P., 63 NY2d 233, 236, supra).  The
societal power to grant an adoption cannot be exercised, however,
by simply intoning the phrase "the best interests of the adoptive
child" as part of the analysis to determine qualification for
adoption.  That approach bypasses crucial, threshold steps and begs
inescapably interwoven questions that must be considered and
answered at the outset of the purely statutory construction issue
in these cases.  Before a court can arrive at the ultimate
conclusion that an adoption is in the best interests of a child
therefore, it is first obliged to discern whether the particular
application is legislatively authorized.  Reversing the analysis
erects the building before the foundation is in place.


 Best interests, in any event, is not an abstract concept
floating in a vacuum, but must be factually rooted, supported by
and applied to an evidentiary record.  With no findings or record
in any prior court in these cases on that issue, we fail to
understand how the Majority here makes first-instance assumptions
to assert and support its conclusions about the best interests of
Jacob and Dana as part of the statutory construction analysis.


 The dual, statutorily-interlocked inquiries of
qualifications and operation-of-law consequences of adoption cannot
be shunted aside in favor of an aspiration that a potential
adoptive person might provide a child with good, better or best
emotional or financial circumstances.  An intuitive preference that
a particular adoption might likely or generally serve some child's
beneficial interests should not suffice to solve the more
comprehensive puzzle of legislative intent that will evolve into a
ratio decidendi as the juridical adoption charter to govern the
whole of a society (see, Domestic Relations Law 114; compare,
Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys, 40 NY2d 543, 546, 552).  We note that
the disciplined approach we would use in deciding these appeals
does not implicate the bona fides or unchallenged loving and caring
motivations and feelings of any of the individuals involved in
these cases.  While promulgated and applied law may take cognizance
of those factors, however, it should not be subordinated to them.
Also, these children are not members of a suspect class (contrast,
Gomez v Perez, 409 US 535; Plyler v Doe, 457 US 202).  They are
members of stable homes, already presently in the permanent
placement and custody of their biological mothers.


 Courts are ultimately limited to viewing issues as
presented in litigated cases within the confines of their
evidentiary records.  Since the Majority agrees that the common
issue in these cases is purely statutory construction, its reliance
on generalized assumptions about life and health insurance, social
security and death benefits, constitutes a questionable policy
makeweight.  Those criteria offer scant guidance towards
discovering legislative intent behind Domestic Relations Law 110
and 117.  Moreover, they are incomplete policy factors,
inappropriate to statutory construction analysis, and their
imputation in these cases simultaneously eschews consideration of
any competing substantial State interest concerns.


 For the benefit of the two youngsters and the
preservation of some orderly procedural regularity, we draw
assurance from tne corrective action that at least remits each case
to Family Court, to undertake a first instance, best interests
hearing in the Jacob case, and an updated hearing in the Dana case,
now that three years have transpired since the court conducted its
original limited inquiry.
III.

  A principal factor in these cases must also ultimately
include consideration of the inexorable operation-of-law
consequences that flow from section 117, a distinctive feature of
New York's adoption laws. Specifically, courts are statutorily
mandated to apply Domestic Relations Law 110 together with the
interconnected features of Domestic Relations Law 117 (compare,
e.g., Matter of Royal Indem. Co. v Tax Appeals Tribunal, 75 NY2d
75, 79; McKinney's Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes 97).



  Domestic Relations Law 117 provides: "After the making
of an order of adoption the natural parents of the adoptive child
shall be relieved of all parental duties toward and of all
responsibilities for and shall have no rights over such adoptive
child or to his [or her] property by descent or succession"
(emphasis added). The plain and overarching language and
punctuation of section 117 cannot be judicially blinked, repealed
or rendered obsolete by interpretation.



  Section 117 says that it severs all facets of a
biolog1cal parent's conjunctively listed relationships upon
adoption of the child (compare, Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys, 40
NY2d 543, supra). This Court has recognized that "[t]he purpose of
the section [former 114, now 117] was to define the relation,
after adoption, of the child to its natural parents and to its
adopting parents, together in their reciprocal rights, duties and
privileges" (Betz v Horr, 276 NY 83, 87; see also, Matter of
Greqory B., 74 NY2d 77, 91).  That is a critically extant,
interpretive proposition from this Court and not some merely
atavistic utterance.


 In implementation of its prerogative to define family
relationships that are accorded legal status, the Legislature even
prescribed a stepparent departure from the otherwise automatic
section 117 consequence.  It thus sought to obviate the inevitable
result that an order of adoption might actually effectuate the
symbolic Solomonic threat by severing the rights of a consenting
biological parent in such specifically-excepted circumstances where
a biological parent is married to an adopting stepparent.  One
would have thought promulgation of such an exception unnecessary,
yet the Legislature chose certainty of statutory expression for
every eventuality as to the severance or non-severance operation-
of-law consequences of section 117.


 Appellants in both cases nevertheless propose the theory
that section 117 is meant to apply only to inheritance succession
of property rights after adoption and should have no effect on the
wider expanse and array of rights and responsibilities of a
biological parent with an adoptive child.  The language of section
117 reveals, however, that the biological parents' duties,
responsibilities and rights with respect to the adoptive child are
inheritance" (Majority opn, at 14).  This statement sidesteps and
subordinates the original and still operative language of section
117 itself:  "The parents of an adopted child are, from the time of
the adoption, relieved from all parental duties toward, and of all
responsibility for, the child so adopted, and have no rights over
it" (L 1873, ch 830, 12 [emphasis added]).  Inheritance was not
mentioned and the comprehensive sweep of the statute could not be
plainer.  Finally, the primacy of this Court's precedents and
legislatively-promulgated words as authority must be accorded
greater rank and respect than any secondary or tertiary materials
characterized as "scholarly commentary."


 Betz v Horr (276 NY 83, supra) is particularly poignant
and cogent.  There, a sick and destitute adopted adult sought
support from her biological father.  In rejecting the claim, the
Court recognized that the purpose of former section 114 (now 117)
was the complete termination of parental rights and
responsibilities of the biological parents following adoption.  The
Court stated that in order to impose upon the biological parent a
duty to support, "it would be necessary to read into section 114
[now 117] of the Domestic Relations Law an intent to preserve the
duty and responsibility of the natural parent to support the child
notwithstandinq the plain and unambiquous provision that, after
adoption, all responsibility of the natural parent for the child
ceases" (id., at 88 [emphasis added]; see also, Matter of Harvey-
Cook v Neill, 118 AD2d 109, 111).  That the biological mothers in
these cases may wish that their parental rights not be terminated
separate and distinct from, and more comprehensive than, a single,
narrow category of inheritance rights.  The use of the disjunctive
"or" before the phrase, "property by descent or succession," cannot
be discounted or avoided; it denotes the important and elemental
legislative demarcation.  These observations are not some
syntactical or grammatical exercise.  Indeed, syntax and grammar
are necessary tools of precise expression, acceptable norms of
interpretation and reasonably uniform understanding and, when
coupled with disciplined, thorough statutory construction
principles, they bear legitimately and cogently on sound and
supportable legal analysis (see, Matter of Brooklyn El. R.R. Co.
125 NY 434, 444-445).


 Besides, section 117(1)(i) merely defines a particular
class of restricted inheritance rights, namely, "intestate descent
and distribution" of property.  Thus, adopted children and their
biological parents may still inherit from one another by will or
acquire property by inter vivos instrument (see, Law Revision
Commission Report, reprinted in 1986 McKinney's Session Laws of NY,
at 2560).  This again demonstrates that the intestate devolution of
property aspect is only a particular species and recent
incorporation into this more sweeping, longstanding statute.  It
does not represent a displacement or total substitution for the
statute's predominant purport.


 The Majority states that "from the very beginning of what
is now section 117, both the scholarly commentary about the section
and its dozen or so amendments have centered on property rights and
separate and distinct from, and more comprehensive than, a single,
narrow category of inheritance rights. The use of the disjunctive
"or" before the phrase, "property by descent or succession," cannot
be discounted or avoided; it denotes the important and elemental
legislative demarcation.  These observations are not some
syntactical or grammatical exercise.  Indeed, syntax and grammar
are necessary tools of precise expression, acceptable norms of
interpretation and reasonably uniform understanding and, when
coupled with disciplined, thorough statutory construction
principles, they bear legitimately and cogently on sound and
supportable legal analysis (see, Matter of Brooklyn El. R.R. Co.
125 NY 434, 444-445).


 Besides, section 117(1)(i) merely defines a particular
class of restricted inheritance rights, namely, "intestate descent
and distribution" of property.  Thus, adopted children and their
biological parents may still inherit from one another by will or
acquire property by inter vivos instrument (see, Law Revision
Commission Report, rePrinted in 1986 McKinney's Session Laws of NY,
at 2560) . This again demonstrates that the intestate devolution of
property aspect is only a particular species and recent
incorporation into this more sweeping, longstanding statute.  It
does not represent a displacement or total substitution for the
statute's predominant purport.


 The Majority states that "from the very beginning of what
is now section 117, both the scholarly commentary about the section
and its dozen or so amendments have centered on property rights and


 Not surprisingly, we believe that the Majority's reliance
on Social Services Law 383-c and Domestic Relations Law 114 and
115-b are inapposite and unpersuasive.  The use of these attenuated
provisions involving entirely different situations to argue for
what amounts to a functional, partial repeal by implication of
section 117's unaltered breadth, is a disfavored approach to
resolving statutory analysis problems.
IV.


 The assembled and varied statutory construction arguments
are, in the end, held together by the Majority's tincture of
constitutional doubt.  A crucial utterance illustrates:  "[A]
construction of the section that would deny children like Jacob and
Dana the opportunity of having their two de facto parents become
their legal parents, based solely on their biological mother's
sexual orientation or marital status, would not only be unjust
but also miqht raise constitutional
under the circumstances
concerns in light of the adoption statute's historically consisten
purpose -- the best interests of the child" (Majority opn, at 22-23
[citations omitted] [emphasis added]).  This sweeping amalgam
allows questionable opportunity for appropriate statutory
amendments to deal with perceived ambiguities.  It also tolerates
no potential for showing in the future any State interest
supporting any enactment regulating this field that could survive
equal protection constitutional attack.


 This "equal protection" concern was not even raised in
either case before the lower courts, and the Majority's preemptive
cloud, coupled with a failure to deal with that issue's complexity,
and implicated jurisprudential nuances is perplexing (compare,
Campaiqn for Fiscal Equity v State of New York, 86 NY2d 307, 312,
324, 332, 344).  Further, the generalization of some hypothesized
result being "unjust under the circumstances" (Majority opn, at
23), while a matter of general concern to any judge, cannot
supplant specific analysis and avoid rational basis judicial
scrutiny within an appropriate and rigorous adjudicatory process
and developed record of pleadings and proof on an as-applied basis.
Whatever labels are used, no constitutional issue is squarely and
thoroughly presented in these cases anyway, nor is any appropriate
for speculation on these records.  Moreover, the vagueness as to
precisely which parties' -- the children or the adopting petitioner
or the biological parent -- constitutional rights are somehow at
risk adds bewilderment to the analysis and attempted, precise
rejoinder.


 Overlaying the entire problem about such projections of
facial or applied constitutional doubt, cast upon a complex set of
statutes, is the inattentiveness to the fundamental presumption of
constitutionality of duly enacted legislation and to the
appropriate deference, indeed "supremacy," of the legislative role
in this area (see, People v Thompson, 83 NY2d 477, 487-488; Matter
of Robert Paul P., 63 NY2d 233, 237, supra; People v Epton, 19 NY2d
496, 505).  These overridden precepts should be central in the
dispositional equation in these cases instead of a tenuous
statutory construction axiom insinuated on a problematical
constitutional premise.


 Significantly, this Court did not even have the benefit
in these cases of the customary adversarial advocacy dynamic.  No
briefs or oral arguments supportive of the results below or against
the arguments for adoptions were presented, though several amici
briefs in support of appellants' positions were accepted.  Thus,
one-sided constitutional claims raised for the first time on appeal
should especially be foreclosed from this Court's consideration
based on well-settled institutional and precedential principles
(see e.g, People v Gray, 86 NY2d 10, 20; Lichtman v Grossbard, 73
NY2d 792, 794; Melahn v Hearn, 60 NY2d 944, 945; Matter of Eaqle v
Paterson, 57 NY2d 831, 833; People v Martin, 50 NY2d 1029, 1031;
Wein v Levitt, 42 NY2d 300, 306; Cohen and Karger, Powers of the
New York Court of Appeals, 169, at 641; see also, Patchoque-
Medford Conqress of Teachers v Bd. of Education, 70 NY2d 57, 71
[Simons, J., concurring]).  We emphasize that it is the dubiety
cast over very significant constitutional propositions in this
fashion that is at least as disquieting as an unequivocal
constitutional declaration.  This is especially so since the
Attorney General of the State was given no notice or opportunity,
as required by Executive Law 71, to fulfill the obligation of the
Department of Law to defend the constitutionality -- or against the
inchoate unconstitutionality -- of the beclouded statutes.


 The instant two cases also take the constitutional hook
of Matter of Patchoque-Medford Conqress of Teachers v Bd. of
Education (70 NY2d 57, supra), where the assertion of a general
constitutional claim in a pleading was used by this Court to reach
a specific State constitutional basis for decision, two giant steps
beyond that significant jurisprudential outer limit.  Now, parties
may assert constitutional claims at the final appeal stage and
appellate courts may drive a debatable statutory construction
wedge -- a speculative, future constitutional concern -- into the
disposition of very significant statutes and cases.


 The Majority's constitutional prognostication is thus
linked to a statutory construction device that teaches courts to
avoid reaching constitutional issues when they need not.  The
rubric is dubiously applied here, however since it is designed
primarily to respect the presumption of constitutionality, not
becloud it.  The presumption is a reservoir of judicial power,
preserving judicial capital, resources and power for when they are
most and unavoidably needed.  The rubric has never been used, as
here, to anticipate amorphous doubt over statutes as applied to
real, future cases and controversies.  By employing a canon of
construction to, in effect, reach an unlitigated issue in order to
avoid potentially "embarrassing constitutional questions" in the
future, the Majority in the instant cases violates the very canon
it invokes.  It ultimately also transgresses another overriding
canon, that courts should not legislate under the guise of
interpretation (see, e.g., People v Finnegan, 85 NY2d 53, 58;
People v Heine, 9 NY2d 925, 929).


 The Majority concludes that "[g]iven that section 117 is
open to two differing interpretations" -- a conclusion with which
we have already noted our strong disagreement in any event -- the
Court must construe the statute to avoid constitutional doubt
(Majority opn, at 22, citinq principally Matter of Lorie C., 49
NY2d 161, 171).  That case dealt with the State constitutional
limits on the jurisdiction of the Family Court in placing juvenile
delinquents in foster homes.  Since the statutory construction
issue directly implicated Article VI, section 13 of the State
Constitution, it is arguably appropriate for the Court to have
added a dictum concerning the special court's jurisdictional limits
under the State Constitution.  As the Court noted, the statutory
question involved the "doctrine of distribution of powers 'that
each department should be free from interference, in the discharge
of its peculiar duties, by either of the others'" (Matter of Lorie
C., supra, at 171 [quotinq Sexton v. Carey, 44 NY2d 545, 549].
Here, the would-be constitutional question involves nothing of that
kind and does not implicate a powers section of the State
Constitution; rather, it forecasts an equal protection "concern."


 As the Court has elsewhere observed, failure to raise a
constitutional issue in nisi prius courts results in an inadequate
record, lack of joinder, and lack of development and testing of
adjudicative analysis to permit and justify the appellate court to
make its fair, reasonably-tested and long-lasting determination and
precedent on the merits (see, People v Gray, 86 NY2d 10, 20, supra;
People v Martin, 50 NY2d 1029, 1031, supra).  Furthermore, if a
litigant does not raise a particular legal argument before a court
of first instance, that effectively deprives the other party -- if
there is one, as there is not in these cases -- of a fair
opportunity to present and answer the proofs and deprives the
process of jurisprudence of the essential check-and-balance against
unilateral mistake or misapprehension.  This Court has also
repeatedly warned that "if any unsought consequences result, the
Legislature is best suited to evaluate and resolve them+ (Bender v
Jamaica Hosp., 40 NY2d 560, 562, _itinq Briqht Homes v Wright, 8
NY2d 157; see, Matter of Robert Paul P., 63 NY2d 233, 239, supra).
These cautions are uniquely appropriate with respect to the
Legislature's concededly "supreme" power and provenance concerning
its legal creature:  adoptions.


 In sum, the common issue here involves a subject on which
the Legislature has expressed itself.  These cases appear on a
screen on which the Legislature has delineated its will and
judgment methodically and meticulously to reflect its enactments.
Ambiguity cannot directly or indirectly create or substitute for
the lack of statutory authorization to adopt.  These adoption
statutes are luminously clear on one unassailable feature:  no
express legislative authorization is discernible for what is,
nevertheless, permitted by the holdings today.  Nor do the statutes
anywhere speak of de facto, functional or second parent adoptions.
Frankly, if the Legislature had intended to alter the definitions
and interplay of its plenary, detailed adoption blueprint to cover
the circumstances as presented here, it has had ample and repeated
opportunities, means and words to effectuate such purpose plainly
and definitively as a matter of notice, guidance, stability and
reliability.  It has done so before (see, e.q., L 1984, ch 218
[permitting adoption by adults not yet divorced]; L 1951, ch 211
[permitting adoption by a minor]).


 Because the Legislature did not do so here, neither
should this Court in this manner.  Cobbling law together out of
interpretative ambiguity that transforms fundamental, societally
recognized relationships and substantive principles is neither
sound statutory construction nor justifiable lawmaking.  Four prior
courts in these two cases correctly dismissed the respective
adoption petitions.  Since those appropriate judicial
determinations are based on what the Legislature actually enacted
and specifically authorized, the Appellate Division orders should
be affirmed.

Decided November 2, 1995
=========================================
Endnotes
1.  The dissent+s criticisms of our reasoning and methodology
are unfounded and undeserved.  A careful process of studying the
various statutes and their history, in an effort to resolve the
novel questions presented, has led us to different conclusions--
not unlike courts elsewhere that have confronted this issue and
in the main have resolved it as we have (see In re TammY, 619
NE2d 315 [Mass 1993]  [permitting second-parent adoption]; In re
B.L.V.B., 628 A2d 1271 [Vt 1993]  [permitting second-parent
adoption]; In re M.M.D., 662 A2d 837,  [DC 1995]  [permitting
second-parent adoption]; but see In re Anael Lace M., 516 NW2d
678 [Wis 1994]).
2.  Though the adoption petition in Matter of Jacob was filed
jointly on behalf of appellant Stephen T.K. and Jacob's
biological mother in "an understandable effort to cover all the
bases" (In re M.M.D., 662 A2d 837, 1995 D.C. App. LEXIS 141
at *10), the fact that appellants chose this procedural route
should not preclude Stephen T.K.--an adult unmarried person--from
adopting Jacob.
3.  By interpreting the language regarding married couples in
sectlon 110 as expansively as it does, the dissent would prohibit
adoptions in whole categories of cases not before us--for
example, when two unmarried adults seek to adopt a child who is
the biological child of neither of them (see, e.q., In re M.M.D.,
662 A2d 837)--thereby decreasing the number of persons eligible
to adopt children deemed +'hard-to-place+ due to circumstances
such as behavioral problems, birth defects or serious illnesses.
4.  The two appeals before us concern adoptions by second
parents, not adoptions "by any number of people who choose to
live together+ (dissent, p. 7).  Similarly, our decision today
does not mandate judicial approval of second-parent adoptions in
all situations, but simply permits them to take place when
appropriate (see Domestic Relations Law  114).
5. This longstanding and widely-recognized principle of
statutory construction is invoked merely as an additional
interpretive aid--a pathway of analysis--in the difficult task of
choosing among possible readings of a statute (see Matter of
Lorie C., 49 NY2d 161, 171; Inter. Fuel + Iron CorP. v Donner
Steel Co., 242 NY 224, 231).  In answering the question posed--
what does the statute mean?--we use all available and appropriate
analytical tools.

Despite the dissent's assertions to the contrary, we are not
declaring section 117 unconstitutional, but instead interpreting
it in a practical, common-sense manner which conserves judicial
resources and avoids the awkward alternative of "giving [it] an
interpretation which might precipitate embarrassing
constitutional questions" in the future (Hove+ v De Lona Hook h
Eve Co., 211 NY 420, 429; see also Matter of Ci+olla v Golisano,
84 NY2d 450. 455).

BRIEF OF AMICI CURIAE STATES OF 
ALABAMA, CALIFORNIA, IDAHO, NEBRASKA, 
SOUTH CAROLINA, SOUTH DAKOTA, AND 
VIRGINIA IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONER 
 
INTERESTS OF AMICI CURIAE 
 
Amici curiae -- states of Alabama, Idaho, California, Nebraska, 
South Carolina, South Dakota, and Virginia hold a common 
view that the ruling and rationale below pose a serious threat to 
state constitutional provisions and, more generally, to legislation 
enacted at any level other than local government. As detailed 
below, the Colorado Supreme Court has announced a 
fundamental constitutional right of equal group participation, in 
the political process that, if allowed to stand, necessarily 
disqualifies state constitutions as repositories of important 
public policies. Indeed, the logical force of the court's rationale 
even casts doubt upon the power of state legislatures to enact 
laws that remove issues favored by "identifiable groups" from 
local political processes. Further, the novel theory underlying 
the ruling conflicts with established principles of equal 
protection, -- thus under mining the stability necessary for states 
to conduct their public affairs with reasonable confidence.  
 
Amici curiae states join in this brief to focus attention on flaws 
in the analysis below and to illuminate their negative 
consequences for state governments. The effect of the decision 
below is to declare off limits to state governments an undefined 
body of policy choices. The prohibition is undefined because the 
court did not explain the term "independently identifiable 
groups," nor did it clarify how disagreeable state action must be 
to such groups before their rights of political participation are 
violated. Nor is it clear to what degree the new principle is 
prospective, or whether it might cause the undoing of numerous 
state policies thought to be well settled. Whatever the scope of 
identifiable groups, and their protected political interests, issues 
falling within the uncertain contours must be left to local 
political processes.  
 
This novel formulation of an asserted fundamental right does 
substantial violence to constitutional principles: It deprives 
states of their constitutional power to structure their political 
functions and allocate government power as they see fit; it 
distorts established doctrines of equal protection by imposing a 
hybrid right labeled "fundamental," but apparently available 
only to certain identifiable groups; and it conflicts with the right 
of the people to set public policies by enacting constitutional 
amendments to limit government actions.  
 
SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT 
 
This is a case in which the court below decided that the 
Constitution's protection of participatory democracy somehow 
required the results of a voter initiative to be set aside. In order 
to reach this remarkable result, the court was required not only 
to stretch beyond recognition an important line of equal 
protection cases decided by this Court, but also to renounce the 
foundational principle that "the people have an original right to 
establish, for their future government, such principles as, in their 
opinion, shall most conduce to their own happiness." Marbury 
v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 176 (1803).  
 
The decision below effectively prohibits states from addressing 
many substantive issues at the state level. It thus creates a right 
to have political issues decided finally -- at the local, rather than 
higher levels. This result conflicts with the general power of 
states to structure their political functions as they see fit, subject 
only to exceptions based on federally protected interests.  
 
This case does not involve suspect classifications. See, e.g., 
Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. 385 (1969). Nor is it about the 
right to cast a vote for the candidate of one's choice. See, e.g., 
Kramer v. Union Free Sch. Dist. No. 15, 395 U.S. 621 (1969); 
Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U.S. 23 (1968). Nor is it about the 
dilution of one's vote through the process of assigning voters to 
malapportioned districts. See, e.g., Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 
533 (1964). Respondents seek not the vote, but rather the right 
to enact laws which regulate the lives and property of others free 
of state constitutional limitations designed to protect the 
liberties of those whom they seek to restrict. In other words, 
Respondents claim (and the court below has recognized) the 
right, as an "independently identifiable" interest group, to have 
local regulatory measures insulated by the Equal Protection 
Clause from revision or repeal at the state level, whether by the 
state legislature or by the people themselves through the 
initiative process.  
 
According to the court below, Amendment 2 violates equal 
protection because it removes one issue important to an 
identifiable (but non-suspect) group from the ordinary political 
process by deciding the issue -- homosexual and bisexual rights- 
- as a matter of state constitutional law. Evans v. Romer, 854 
P.2d 1270 (Colo. 1993) ("Evans I"), Pet. App. D-25-26.[FN1] 
The Colorado court held that strict scrutiny is triggered under 
the Equal Protection Clause not because Amendment 2 employs 
a suspect classification, but because it "singles out and prohibits 
this [non-suspect] class of persons from seeking governmental 
action favorable to it and, thus, from participating equally in the 
political process." Id. at D-26.  
 
Not only is the court's holding not supported by Hunter, or any 
of this Court's other precedents, it directly conflicts with the 
holding and reasoning of James v. Valtierra, 402 U.S. 137 
(1971), which explicitly rejected a claim identical in all material 
respects to that upheld in this case. Hunter and its progeny are 
not about an Equal Protection Clause at war with popular 
democracy and state constitutional freedoms. Instead, this 
important line of cases is inextricably intertwined with the 
central meaning of equal protection -- the protection of racial 
minorities against laws which place unique burdens upon their 
ability to enact legislation prohibiting racial discrimination. 
Hunter, 393 U.S. at 391.  
 
The decision of the court below seriously threatens the right of 
all of the people to participate collectively and directly in the 
political process. It also threatens many civil liberties protected 
by state and federal law. This decision has already been 
followed by one federal district court to set aside a similar ballot 
initiative passed by voters in Cincinnati, Ohio. Equality Found. 
of Greater Cincinnati, Inc. v. City of Cincinnati, 860 F. Supp. 
417 (S.D. Ohio 1994). The decision also casts a long shadow 
over numerous provisions of state constitutions and statutes that 
remove issues favored by other "identifiable groups" from the 
local political process.  
 
ARGUMENT 
 
I. THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OF POLITICAL 
PARTICIPATION CREATED BY THE COURT BELOW IS 
INCONSISTENT WITH THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE 
PEOPLE AND THEIR RIGHT TO ALLOCATE 
GOVERNMENTAL POWER WITHIN THE STATE AS 
THEY SEE FIT.  
 
Although the court below acknowledged that the Colorado 
Constitution proclaims that "[a]ll political power is vested in 
and derived from the people," and that the people "have the sole 
and exclusive right of governing themselves . . and to alter and 
abolish their constitution," Evans I (Pet. App. D-2, quoting 
Colo. Const. art. 2, Sections 1 and 2), its decision in this case is 
based on a new and radical principle totally at odds with the 
sovereignty of the people. The "infringement" of the right of 
political participation which requires, according to the court, 
that Amendment 2 be set aside is nothing more than the 
necessary and normal result of a political disagreement between 
the sovereign people of Colorado and their elected 
representatives -- their employees -- in state and local 
government. The people have amended their constitution to 
forbid their employees from making homosexuality and 
bisexuality protected categories under anti-discrimination laws. 
The court below has determined that since this issue is 
important to certain identifiable interest groups, it may not be 
decided by the people through an initiative amending the state 
constitution.  
 
This is a revolutionary repudiation of the basic principle of self-
government on which our democratic institutions are based. As 
this Court said almost two centuries ago in Marbury v. Madison, 
5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 176 (1803), "the people have an original 
right to establish, for their future government, such principles 
as, in their opinion, shall most conduce to their own happiness." 
See also, The Federalist No. 39 (J. Madison). In furtherance of 
this political truth, this Court has recognized that citizen 
initiatives, such as Amendment 2, are an essential means of 
assuring popular sovereignty. For example, in City of Eastlake 
v. Forest City Enters., 426 U.S. 668, 673 (1976), this Court 
stated that "[t]he referendum . . . is a means for direct political 
participation, allowing the people the final decision, amounting 
to a veto power, over enactments of representative bodies." This 
Court also recognized that "[i]n establishing legislative bodies, 
the people can reserve to themselves power to deal directly with 
matters which might otherwise be assigned to the legislature." 
Id. at 672. The Colorado Supreme Court's unprecedented 
decision its a significant threat to the right of direct self 
government through citizen initiatives. It also threatens to 
invalidate many basic rights currently existing under state 
constitutions.  
 
Nor can the Colorado Supreme Court's decision be squared with 
the Constitutional principle of federalism. According to the 
court below, "any legislation or state constitutional amendment 
which infringes" the right of political participation must be 
subjected to strict scrutiny. Evans I (Pet. App. D-21) (emphasis 
added). In effect, the court held that all issues deemed important 
by identifiable groups must be decided by local elected 
representatives, not by state legislatures, direct democracy, or 
constitutional amendment.  
 
This Court has recognized, however, that local governments are 
instrumentalities of the state, and that the state can, with limited 
exceptions, grant and withdraw powers to such governments at 
its pleasure. The general rule concerning the power of states to 
structure internal political functions and to allocate government 
power was articulated well in Hunter v. City of Pittsburgh, 207 
U.S. 161, 165 (1907). There this Court wrote:  
 
municipal corporations are political subdivisions of the state, 
created as convenient agencies for exercising such of the 
governmental powers of the state as may be intrusted to them. 
The number, nature, and duration of the powers conferred upon 
these corporations, and the territory over which they shall be 
exercised rests in the absolute discretion of the state.... The state, 
therefore, at its pleasure may modify or withdraw such powers, 
may take without compensation such property, hold itself or 
vest it in other agencies, expand or contract the territorial area, 
unite the whole or another part of it with another municipality, 
repeal the charter and destroy the corporation. All this may be 
done, conditionally or unconditionally, with or without the 
consent of the citizens or even against their protest.  
 
Id. at 178-79 (emphasis added). Hunter v. City of Pittsburgh 
remains good law States generally have absolute power relative 
to local governments. As a consequence, identifiable groups 
have no constitutional claim to final and binding 
decisionmaking at the local level of government, and local 
governments have no inherent constitutional standing to 
challenge state action.[FN2]  
 
While Hunter v. City of Pittsburgh addressed state authority to 
distribute power vertically, i.e., between state and local 
governments, states also retain authority to allocate power 
horizontally, i.e., among the branches of government, and the 
people, as they see fit. A state's allocation of power among 
branches of government, standing alone, is not subject to federal 
constitutional restraint. "Whether the legislative, executive and 
judicial powers of a State shall be kept distinct and separate, or 
whether persons or collections of persons belonging to one 
department may, in some respects, exert powers which, strictly 
speaking, pertain to another department, is for the determination 
of the State." Dreyer v. Illinois, 187 U.S. 71, 84 (1902). See also 
Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 256 (1957) 
(Frankfurter, J., concurring) ("It would make the deepest of 
inroads upon our federal system for this court to hold that it can 
determine the appropriate distribution of powers and their 
delegation within the . . . states.") Sailors v. Board of Educ. of 
Kent County, 387 U.S. 105, 109 (1967) ("Save and unless the 
state, county or municipal government runs afoul of a federally 
protected right, it has vast leeway in the management of its 
internal affairs.").  
 
State discretion in structuring decisionmaking authority also 
includes the choice of the people to reserve certain powers to 
themselves. Pacific States Tel. and Tel. Co. v. Oregon, 223 U.S. 
118 (1912) (claim that initiative and referendum process 
violated guarantee clause held nonjusticiable). Just as Hunter v. 
Pittsburgh recognized state control ever vertical distributions of 
power, these cases expand the principle to horizontal 
allocations. There is no constitutional directive that states 
delegate any particular power or issue to any branch of 
government. Correspondingly, there is no right of identifiable 
groups to demand that any particular branch be empowered to 
act on a given matter. While the right to petition is fundamental, 
United Mine Workers of Am., Dist. 12 v. Illinois Bar Ass'n., 
389 U S.. 217, 222 (1967), it defies law and reason to claim the 
right requires that every government office retain the inviolate 
authority to grant every petition.  
 
To be sure, state action, concerning both substantive law as well 
as political process and structure, is subject to constitutional 
limits. States may not structure their functions in a way that 
damages federally protected rights or interests. Hunter v. 
Erickson 393 U.S. 385 (1969). To state that preposition, 
however, is to place claimed constitutional rights into a 
federalist context. Rights do not exist in a vacuum, and cannot 
be recognized without consequence to other constitutional 
values.  
 
In short, the Equal Protection Clause simply does not elevate 
local government over all competing governmental authorities, 
including the people themselves.  
 
II. AMENDMENT 2 DOES NOT IMPAIR ANY 
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT WITHIN THE MEANING OF 
THIS COURT'S EQUAL PROTECTION DECISIONS  
 
The trial court rejected Respondents' claim that homosexuals 
and bisexuals constitute a suspect or quasi suspect class. Pet. 
App. C-18-19. Respondents did not appeal that holding, and the 
court below did not base its decision on a suspect or quasi-
suspect class rationale. Evans I (Pet. App. D-7-8). Thus, in order 
to trigger strict scrutiny of Amendment 2, it was necessary for 
Respondents to establish that the amendment creates "inequal 
ities bearing on fundamental rights." See Laurence H. Tribe, 
American Constitutional Law Section 16-7, at 1454 (2d ed. 
1988).  
 
The court below stated that the "most explicit, and nuanced, 
articulation" of the fundamental right at issue was contained in a 
series of decisions, beginning with Hunter, in which this Court 
reviewed "legislation which prevented the normal political 
institutions and processes from enacting particular legislation 
desired by an identifiable group of voters." Evans I (Pet. App. 
D-14). The cases relied upon by the court, however, do not 
support the court's holding.  
 
In Hunter, this Court considered whether an amendment to the 
Akron, Ohio city charter violated the Equal Protection Clause. 
The amendment prohibited the city council from implementing 
any ordinance dealing with racial, religious, or ancestral 
discrimination in housing X without the approval of a majority 
of voters in a regular or general election. The racially 
discriminatory impact of this provision was crucial to the 
Court's rationale. In striking down the challenged charter 
amendment, this Court did not craft an amorphous new right of 
political participation for any and every identifiable group; 
rather, the Court invalidated the law because it constituted a 
"meaningful and unjustified official distinction [ ] based on 
race." Hunter, 393 U.S. at 391.[FN3] In other words, the central 
point in Hunter was that the charter amendment placed "special 
burdens on racial minorities" concerning their ability to enact 
legislation prohibiting racial discrimination in housing. Id. 
(emphasis added).  
 
Similarly, in Washington v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 458 U.S. 
457 (1982), this Court invalidated a voter initiative which 
stipulated that no local school board could require any student to 
attend a school other than the one located nearest or next nearest 
to the child's residence. The initiative was facially neutral 
regarding race, but included a large number of exceptions to the 
rule, which led this Court to conclude it was enacted "because 
of," not merely "in spite of," its adverse effects upon busing for 
racial integration. Id. at 471. The Court carefully discussed the 
meaning of Hunter and explained why legislation of the kind 
challenged in that case "falls into an inherently suspect 
category":  
 
[W]hen the political process or the decisionmaking mechanism 
used to address racially conscious legislation -- and only such 
legislation -- is singled out for peculiar and disadvantageous 
treatment, the governmental action plainly "rests on 'distinctions 
based on race.'"  
 
Id. at 485-86 (quoting James v. Valtierra, 402 U.S at 141, and 
Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. at 391) (emphasis added).  
 
Hunter and Seattle School District are not fundamental rights 
cases. They are suspect class cases which hold that "when 
government acts to single out a racial problem for special 
treatment, and when the special treatment operates to the 
peculiar disadvantage of racial minorities, there is reason for 
more than usual suspicion of the legislative judgment." 
Sunstein, supra, 1982 Sup. Ct. Rev at 165 (emphasis added). In 
other words, these cases hold that a classification is race- 
specific "if it singles out a racial problem for special and 
disadvantageous treatment." Id. at 149. There is no reasonable 
way to read Hunter and Seattle School District as supporting the 
far-reaching fundamental right applied by the court in this case. 
Both cases involved this Court's efforts to implement the 
principle lying at the core of equal protection -- the prevention 
of invidious discrimination on the basis of race.[FN4]  
 
As Justice Erickson's thoughtful dissent in Evans I makes clear, 
the Colorado Supreme Court's reading of Hunter as the source 
of a broad right of political participation for "identifiable 
groups" was explicitly discussed and rejected by this Court in 
James. See Evans I (Pet. App. D-49-52) (Erickson, J., 
dissenting). James upheld the constitutionality of a California 
constitutional amendment which provided that no "low rent 
housing project" could be undertaken by "any state public body" 
until the project was approved by a majority of the voters at a 
community election. James, 402 U.S. at 139 n.2. Thus, as in the 
case of Colorado Amendment 2, the California amendment 
made it more difficult for an identifiable group (the poor) to 
enact part of its legislative agenda through the normal political 
process. Appellees in James, a number of low-income residents 
of California, argued that the California amendment constituted 
"unconstitutional discrimination because it hampers persons 
desiring public housing from achieving their objective when no 
such roadblock faces other groups seeking to influence other 
public decisions to their advantage." 402 U.S. at 142. The Court 
clearly rejected this attack on California's "procedure for 
democratic decisionmaking." Id. at 143. Justice Black's majority 
opinion in James explained the Court's reasoning in terms that 
reject authoritatively the reasoning of the court below in this 
case:  
 
But of course a lawmaking procedure that "disadvantages" a 
particular group does not always deny equal protection. Under 
any such holding, presumably a State would not be able to 
require referendums on any subject unless referendums were 
required on all, because they would always disadvantage some 
group.  
 
Id. at 142. Since the Court in James read Hunter as a case 
involving political burdens on racial minorities (id. at 140- 41), 
and since the poor are not a suspect class under the Equal 
Protection Clause, the Court held that the California amendment 
could be invalidated "only by extending Hunter, and this we 
decline to do." Id. at 141.  
 
Likewise, the attempt by the court below to read Gordon v. 
Lance, 403 U.S. 1 (1971), as support for an extremely far- 
reaching right of political participation is misguided. See Evans 
I (Pet. App. D-19-20). In Gordon, this Court upheld a West 
Virginia law that proscribed the state's political subdivisions 
from incurring bonded indebtedness or raising taxes without the 
prior approval of 60% of the voters in a referendum. The Court 
held that, unlike the facts of Hunter, the West Virginia law did 
not single out any "discrete and insular minority" for special 
burdens. 403 U.S. at 5. Therefore, there was no equal protection 
violation. Id. at 7.  
 
Noting that the West Virginia laws upheld in Gordon "had 
nothing to do with racial minorities or any other traditionally 
suspect class, yet the Court felt compelled to discuss Hunter," 
the court below concluded that Hunter "applies to a broad 
spectrum of discriminatory legislation." Evans I (Pet. App. D-
19-20). The court attempted to bolster this specious reasoning 
by adding the following trivial insight: "If . . . Hunter is a 'race' 
case and nothing more, the Supreme Court could have 
summarily dismissed the notion that it was applicable in 
Gordon." Id. But, of course, this Court in Gordon did precisely 
what Evans I said it did not do-it discussed Hunter only to 
distinguish it as a case involving legislation that singled out 
racial minorities and other suspect classes for unfavorable 
treatment. Gordon, 403 U.S. at 5. Although the West Virginia 
laws made it more difficult for some political groups to enact 
their legislative agendas, these laws did not discriminate against 
any racial or other suspect class and, therefore, did not violate 
the Equal Protection Clause. Id. at 5-7. Thus, Gordon is an 
application -- not a repudiation -- of the "race only" reading of 
Hunter.  
 
Taken one by one or together, Hunter, Seattle School District, 
James, and Gordon do not support a broad right for any and 
every identifiable group to have its political agenda, as enacted 
by local governments, insulated against superseding state law. 
Rather, these cases recognize that the central purpose of the 
Equal Protection Clause is to protect racial and other suspect 
classes against discriminatory state action. Therefore, laws that 
single out racial problems for special and disadvantageous 
treatment are subject to strict scrutiny even if the laws are 
facially neutral. Laws that make it more difficult for non- 
suspect groups to enact their political agendas, such as the laws 
upheld in James and Gordon, do not conflict with equal 
protection. Since Amendment 2 falls into the latter category, the 
court below erred by subjecting the amendment to strict 
scrutiny.  
 
The Colorado Supreme Court also found support for the 
fundamental right of political participation in this Court's cases 
dealing with the right to an equally weighted vote in the 
electoral process. The court discovered what it referred to as a 
"common thread" between this case and three groups of this 
Court's voting rights cases -- the right to vote cases, the 
reapportionment cases, and the ballot access cases. See, e.g., 
Kramer v. Union Free School Dist., 395 U.S. 621 (1969); 
Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964); Williams v. Rhodes, 
393 U.S. 23 (1968). In each of these cases, however, the basis 
for this Court's decision was the fact that the challenged laws 
impinged directly on the established and fundamental right to 
vote for the candidates of one's choice. None of these cases even 
remotely invokes the principle which controlled the decision 
below -- a vague right of political participation that extends 
beyond the voting booth to invalidate state constitutional 
limitations on substantive legislative agendas. To be sure, these 
voting rights cases do demonstrate that this Court recognizes the 
importance of equality in assuring citizens an equally-weighted 
vote for the candidates of their choice. The court below ignored 
this context and improperly read these cases as supporting a 
seemingly unlimited right to have a political agenda, as 
expressed in local regulation, insulated against the 
countervailing interests of others, as expressed in the statewide 
initiative process.  
 
In this case, there is no state-created obstacle to voting or any 
other aspect of the electoral process. The voting rights cases are 
not applicable to Amendment 2, and the court below erred by 
relying upon them.  
 
III. THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OF POLITICAL 
PARTICIPATION CREATED BY THE COURT BELOW IS 
INCONSISTENT WITH THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO 
ENACT CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS TO PROTECT 
CIVIL LIBERTIES  
 
The potential scope of the right recognized by the court below is 
breathtaking. If the court means what it says, it has discovered a 
constitutional right of any "independently identifiable class of 
persons" to have its politi cal agenda insulated against normal 
democratic processes.  
 
The idea animating this remarkable new right appears to be the 
truism that constitutional law discourages political participation 
by groups who favor unconstitutional legislation. Thus, 
homosexuals and bisexuals were discouraged by Amendment 2 
because it made their desire to enact regulations on the lives, 
businesses, and property of others -- through enactment of "gay 
rights" legislation -- more difficult to accomplish. Similarly, the 
Establishment Clause of the First Amendment discourages 
political participation of some religious groups because it 
prohibits the enactment of many of their politi cal preferences, 
such as state financing of parochial schools. Pro-life groups, 
members of which often share an "independently identifiable" 
religious and cultural heritage, are discouraged by the 
unenumerated right of privacy, by state equal rights 
amendments, and by other provisions of state constitutions 
protecting reproductive rights, because these provisions prohibit 
their strong preferences for laws restricting access to abortion 
services. Organized groups of crime victims are discouraged 
from political participation by the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and 
Eighth Amendments, and by their counterparts in state 
constitutions, because these civil liberties invalidate laws that 
violate the rights of defendants in criminal cases.  
 
The list is endless. Constitutional law routinely discourages 
groups from seeking to legislate political agendas which the 
Constitution has taken out of the hands of legislators. Indeed, 
the central purpose of the Bill of Rights and similar protections 
in state constitutions is to shelter persons whose liberties are 
protected against political agendas designed to restrict those 
rights.  
 
The right of political participation created by the court below 
casts a long shadow over the right of the people to protect their 
freedom by adopting constitutional liberties. Although the court 
below did not define the concept of an "independently 
identifiable group," it did conclude that it was broad enough to 
cover non suspect classes such as homosexuals and bisexuals. 
Evans I (Pet. App. D-25-26). Moreover, while denying that it 
was opening the floodgates for other groups wishing to employ 
the right of political participation, the court sup plied no limiting 
principle to contain this new right. Id. at D-23-27.  
 
In Equality Found. of Greater Cincinnati, Inc. v. City of 
Cincinnati, 860 F. Supp. 417 (S.D. Ohio 1994), a federal district 
court followed Evans I and permanently enjoined a ballot 
initiative passed overwhelmingly by the voters of Cincinnati. 
The court attempted to limit the scope of the right of political 
participation by distinguishing between "independently 
identifiable groups" and mere "identifiable groups." 860 F. 
Supp. at 434 n.12. The court said that "the difference between 
an 'independently identifiable group' and an 'identifiable group' 
is that where the factor identifying the group transcends the 
mere support for any given issue, the group is 'independently 
identifiable.'" Id. "On the other hand, a group whose sole 
identifying characteristic is the group's support for a single issue 
is merely an identifiable group." Id. Under this definition, most 
identifiable groups -- such as the ones discussed in the examples 
above -- are also independently identifiable groups.[FN5]  
 
Indeed, any generally applicable definition of independently 
identifiable group that is broad enough to include homosexuals 
and bisexuals almost certainly will include many other groups 
whose policy preferences have been placed beyond the ordinary 
political process by the state constitutional rights of 
individuals.[FB6] Nor is the principle limited to constitutional 
provisions. According to the court below, "any legislation or 
state constitutional amendment which infringes" the right of 
political participation must be subjected to strict scrutiny. Evans 
I (Pet. App. D-21) (emphasis added). Although it is not clear 
from the opinion that the court understood the significance of 
this very broad statement, it appears to mean that all issues 
affecting identifiable interest groups must be decided by elected 
representatives at the level of local government. Assume, for 
example, the Colorado legislature had enacted statewide 
legislation containing the same substantive policy choice as that 
contained in Amendment 2. Under the decision below, the 
legislation is unconstitutional because it has removed the issue 
of homosexual rights from the normal political process of local 
government. This principle threatens most substantive 
legislation.  
 
For example, regulation of smoking obviously affects an 
"independently identifiable" group. Evans I calls into doubt 
tough statewide measures such as Maryland's Regulation 
Section 09.12.23 (barring smoking in most workplaces), 
promulgated under that state's Occupational Safety and Health 
Act, Md. Code Ann., Health Gen. Section 24-501, et seq (1990). 
As a result of the regulation, smokers are unable to seek more 
favorable treatment from local jurisdictions. Further, if smokers 
secured passage of a statewide measure opening the workplace 
to smoking, and preempting more restrictive local standards, 
then nonsmokers would have an Evans I claim that they had 
been fenced out of the process.  
 
As the Maryland example illustrates, Evans I not only 
encourages the factionalizing of the community into aggrieved 
groups, it also generates groups with mirror opposite claims, 
which, if the doctrine is applied consistently, will be locked in 
judicial stalemate. Such is the case in Oregon, where the state 
legislature recently enacted a measure that is the polar opposite 
of Amendment 2. Oregon's new law prohibits local governments 
from enacting measures that block protected status based on 
homosexuality. See O.R.S. 659.165 (1993). To the extent that 
identifiable cultural, religious, or political groups favor enacting 
such local measures, they have been locked out of the process, 
and have a claim under Evans I. Thus, presumably neither the 
proponents nor the opponents of statewide measures extending 
anti-discrimination protection to homosexuals would be 
permitted, under the Colorado Supreme Court's reasoning, to 
"enact legislation in their interest."  
 
The list of state constitutional or legislative provisions that 
might be challenged as interfering with the political 
participation of identifiable groups is long. Noted below are just 
a sampling of state measures that would appear vulnerable.  
 
State civil service and personnel systems. Most states have some 
form of civil service and personnel system governing conditions 
of state employment. It is common for such schemes to prohibit 
the state from contracting out work that will result in the 
displacement of classified employees. However, private 
contractors, reform groups, taxpayer advocate groups, and 
others may desire greater use of contracting to accomplish state 
objectives. Although such a policy clearly would be "in their 
interest," they cannot pursue it without mounting a 
constitutional campaign. See, e.g., Ca. Const. art. 7 Section 1; 
Co. Const. Art. 9, Section 1; N.Y. Const. art. 5, Section 6. And 
if the campaign succeeds, a class of independently identifiable 
state employees could challenge the action.  
 
Prohibitions on public expenditures to benefit any religious 
school. Such provisions are common among the states. Sees 
e.g., Ariz. Const. art. 2, Section 12; Ca. Const. art. 9, Section 8; 
Minn. Const. art. 1, Section 16; Wash. Const. art. 9, Section 4; 
Wis. Const. art. 1, Section 18; and others. As a result of such 
provisions, supporters of private religious schools may not 
petition local school districts, the state legislature, or any other 
democratic body for financial or material aid, even if such aid 
would be fully consistent with the First Amendment. Their only 
remedy is to seek a constitutional amendment.  
 
State public utility schemes. All states have some form of utility 
regulation. Such schemes not only regulate the rates and 
practices of utilities, but grant monopoly status to such utilities. 
In an era of deregulation, increasing competition, and 
technological advance, ratepayers, consumer groups, or 
competing providers are making proposals to open controlled 
markets to competition. In many cases a constitutional 
amendment would be necessary to authorize such reform. See, 
e.g., Ca. Const. art. 12, Section 6; Ga. Const. art. 4, Section 1, P 
1; Ok. Const. art. 9, Section 18.  
 
Bars on public funding for abortions. Several states bar public 
funding of abortions, either by constitutional pro vision, see, 
e.g., Ark. Const. amend. 68, Section 1; Colo. Const art. 5, 
Section 5X); or by statute. See, e.g., Wis. Stat. Ann. Section 
59.07 (West 1988 & 1994 Supp.) (prohibiting local 
governments from funding abortions); Mo. Ann. Stat. Section 
105.711 (Vernon 1995 Supp.). Several identifiable groups, such 
as women, the poor, or poor women, might feel it in their 
interest to petition for a different policy. But they cannot, unless 
they mount a statewide effort.  
 
The list could continue indefinitely, but the matters already 
addressed demonstrate the destabilizing nature of the "right" 
identified in Evans I. The Colorado Supreme Court's decision 
below should be reversed.  
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The court below has misinterpreted several of this Court's equal 
protection decisions to create an unprecedented and 
revolutionary fundamental right of any and every 
"independently identifiable" interest group to overturn statewide 
constitutional and/or statutory provisions that prevent them from 
enacting their regulatory agendas at the local level of 
government. This new equal protection doctrine has cast a long 
shadow of uncertainty not only over the traditional right of 
democratic self-government, but also over the concept of 
constitutionalism -- of representative government tempered by 
individual liberty. Clearly, the Equal Protection Clause does not 
provide protection for any and every special interest group 
against the political discouragement that necessarily arises when 
a political issue favored by the group is removed from the local 
political process by a constitutional amendment. As Justice 
Black stated in James, "[provisions for referendums demonstrate 
devotion to democracy, not to bias, discrimination, or 
prejudice." James, 402 U.S. at 141. "This procedure for 
democratic decisionmaking does not violate the constitutional 
command that no State shall deny to any person 'the equal 
protection of the laws.' " Id. at 143. The only interference with 
political participation in this case was the attempt by 
Respondents to set aside the results of an election they lost. The 
people of Colorado chose to enact Amendment 2. Their decision 
may have been wise or unwise. Regardless, nothing in the 
Constitution requires this substantive choice by the people to be 
nullified by judicial decree.  
 
For all of the foregoing reasons, amici urge the Court to reverse 
the decision below and restore to the people of Colorado the 
results of their democratic decisionmaking.

1 Evans I affirmed the trial court's issuance of a preliminary 
injunction against enforcement of Amendment 2. Subsequently, 
the Colorado Supreme Court reaffirmed the constitutional 
principles it had articulated in Evans I and entered final 
judgment permanently enjoining enforcement of Amendment 2. 
Evans v. Romer, 882 P.2d 1335 (Colo. 1994) ("Evans II") (Pet. 
App. B).  
 
2 Local governments may sue the state for withdrawing power 
from the local political process only when some intervening 
federal action vests power with the subdivision rather than the 
state. Ct. Lawrence County v. Lead-Deadwood Sch. Dist., No. 
40-1, 469 U.S. 256 (1985) (payments under federal statute to 
units of local government "for any governmental purpose" 
precludes states from controlling how local units spend money).  
 
3 Hunter was decided several years before this Court deter 
mined, in Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239 (1976), that a 
facially-neutral classification is not suspect absent proof of "a 
racially discriminatory purpose." Professor Cass Sunstein has 
commented that "the difficulty now of understanding the Court's 
opinion [in Hunter] stems largely from that subsequent 
development." Cass R. Sunstein, Public Values, Private 
Interests, and the Equal Protection Clause, 1982 Sup. Ct. Rev. 
127, 147. Perhaps this explains the misreading of Hunter by the 
court below.  
 
4 This also explains this Courts decision in Reitman v. Mulkey, 
387 U.S. 369 (1967). In Reitman, the Court invalidated an 
initiated measure that guaranteed private citizens absolute 
discretion to discriminate in the sale or rental of residential real 
property. This Court held that the law violated the Equal 
Protection Clause because it "was intended to authorize, and 
does authorize, racial discrimination in the housing market." Id. 
at 381 (emphasis added).  
 
5 For example, many groups which support state financing for 
parochial schools share a common religious tradition, dating 
back several thousand years, which transcends any particular 
issue. Similarly, many (perhaps most) pro-life groups are 
composed of individuals who share religious and cultural 
characteristics which transcend the politics of abortion.  
 
6 Logically, the right of political participation would extend to 
apply against the federal government by virtue of the equal 
protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process 
Clause. See Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S.497 (1954). Thus, 
identifiable groups could argue that many provisions in federal 
legislation restrict their political participation by removing their 
preferred issues from the political process. This application of 
the newly-minted equal protection principle would stand the 
Supremacy Clause on its head.

<P>In November 1992, Colorado passed by popular vote an amendment denying "protected status based on homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual orientation." In July 1993, the Colorado Supreme Court issued a preliminary injunction on the basis that the amendment violated the Fourteenth Amendment by denying homosexuals equal protection under the law. The injunction was upheld in October of 1994.</P>
<P>The Attorney General of Colorado filed this brief on behalf of Governor Roy Romer and state of Colorado, asking the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse the decision, stating that "the extension of minority status or preference laws to include sexual orientation would be tantamount to granting special rights, which are not enjoyed by the public at large."</P>

BRIEF FOR PETITIONERS 
 
 
The Governor of Colorado, and the State of Colorado, through 
Gale A. Norton, the Attorney General of Colorado, urge this 
Court to reverse the decision of the Colorado Supreme Court and 
hold that Colo. Const. art. II, Section 30b ("Amendment 2") does

OPINIONS BELOW 
 
The opinions of the Colorado Supreme Court (Pet. App. B and 
D) are reported at 882 P.2d 1335 (Colo. 1994) and 854 P.2d 1270 
(Colo. 1993), respectively. The opinions of the trial court (Pet. 
App. C and E) are not reported.  
 
JURISDICTION 
 
The jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 
Section 1257. The opinion of the Colorado Supreme Court was 
issued on October 11, 1994, and modified on November 7, 1994. 
The judgment of the Colorado Supreme Court (Pet. App. A) was 
entered on November 14, 1994. Petitioners filed the petition for 
certiorari on December 12, 1994. The petition was granted on 
February 21, 1995.  
 
CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS 
 
Article II,  30b of the Colorado Constitution provides:  
 
"NO PROTECTED STATUS BASED ON HOMOSEXUAL, 
LESBIAN, OR BISEXUAL ORIENTATION. Neither the State 
of Colorado, through any of its branches or departments, nor any 
of its agencies, political subdivisions, municipalities or school 
districts, shall enact, adopt or enforce any statute, regulation, 
ordinance or policy whereby homosexual, lesbian or bisexual 
orientation, conduct, practices or relationships shall constitute or 
otherwise be the basis of, or entitle any person or class of persons 
to have any claim of minority status, quota preferences, protected 
status or claim of discrimination. This Section of the Constitution 
shall be in all respects self-executing."  
 
The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United 
States provides, in pertinent part:  
 
"No State shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the 
equal protection of the laws."  
 
STATEMENT OF THE CASE 
 
This case involves the validity of a Colorado constitutional 
amendment, popularly known as "Amendment 2," which 
precludes any state or local governmental entity from adopting or 
enforcing any law or policy providing special protections for 
homosexuals and bisexuals. Pet. App. D-25.[fn 1] The Colorado 
Supreme Court conclusively determined that "the immediate 
objective" of Amendment 2 was "to repeal existing [laws] of 
state and local entities that barred discrimination based on sexual 
orientation." Pet. App. D-24. At bottom, Amendment 2 
constitutes a fundamental decision by the State's citizens 
concerning "a particular division of authority . . . between state 
and local governing bodies." Washington v. Seattle School Dist. 
No. 1, 458 U.S. 457, 493 (1982). The pivotal legal issue in this 
case is whether, as the Colorado Supreme Court held, the federal 
Constitution dictates a different division of authority among 
institutions of local government whenever the matter at issue 
implicates the interests of any "independently identifiable group. 
"  
 
A. Proceedings Below. 
 
Amendment 2 was adopted at the November 1992 general 
election, by a vote of 813,966 in favor and 710,151 against 
(53.4% to 46.6%). Respondents instituted this lawsuit in a 
Colorado state court under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983, claiming that 
Amendment 2 facially violates several provisions of the federal 
constitution. The trial court preliminarily enjoined Petitioners 
solely on legal grounds from enforcing Amendment 2 pending 
the outcome of a trial on the merits. Pet. App. E-18.[fn 2]  
 
On July 19, 1993, the Colorado Supreme Court affirmed the 
issuance of the preliminary injunction, albeit on different 
grounds. Pet. App. D. The court determined that Amendment 2 
presumptively violated a "fundamental right" protected by the 
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, of any 
identifiable group to have political issues addressed at all levels 
of government. Consequently, the Colorado Supreme Court 
affirmed and remanded the matter for a trial on whether 
Amendment 2.is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state 
interest.  
 
Trial was held October 12-22, 1993. In addition to whether 
Amendment 2 was supported by a compelling state interest, the 
parties also litigated whether homosexuals and bisexuals 
constituted a "suspect" or "quasi-suspect" class for equal 
protection purposes. The trial court ruled that homosexuals and 
bisexuals do not constitute a suspect or quasi-suspect class. Pet. 
App. C-18, C-19. With respect to the new "right," the court 
found that Amendment 2 promotes two compelling interests -- 
religious freedom and familial privacy. The court nonetheless 
held the provision unconstitutional because it is not narrowly 
drawn to achieve those purposes in the least restrictive manner 
possible. Pet. App. C-14.  
 
On October 11, 1994, the Colorado Supreme Court affirmed, 
restating its earlier holding that Amendment 2 infringes upon a 
fundamental right of an identifiable group to participate equally 
in the political process, and upholding the trial court's 
determination that Amendment 2 was not narrowly tailored to the 
State's compelling interests. Pet. App. B. The supreme court 
expressly noted, however, the trial court's findings and 
conclusions rejecting Respondents' suspect or quasi-suspect class 
claim. Pet. App. B-6 n.3. The court further noted that 
Respondents had not appealed that aspect of the case, and 
accordingly refused to consider the issue. Id.  
 
B.  Statement of Facts. 
 
At the time Amendment 2 was proposed, a number of 
governmental entities in Colorado had granted special legal 
protections to homosexuals and bisexuals: three cities (Denver, 
Boulder, and Aspen) had sexual orientation ordinances regulating 
employment, housing, and public accommodations; the Colorado 
Civil Rights Commission had voted to recommend that the 
Colorado General Assembly extend the State's civil rights act to 
ban discrimination based upon sexual orientation; the Governor 
had issued an executive order prohibiting job discrimination for 
state classified employees based on sexual orientation; at least 
two state colleges had policies prohibiting discrimination based 
on sexual orientation; and the General Assembly had enacted a 
statute prohibiting health insurance companies from determining 
insurability based on sexual orientation.[fn 3]  
 
Believing that the General Assembly and other governmental 
officials were not sufficiently responsive to the public on this 
particular issue, the sponsors of Amendment 2 decided to take 
the issue directly to the people. In the words of those sponsors, 
Amendment 2 was intended to prevent homosexuals and 
bisexuals from receiving a preferred status under state and local 
laws (v. 15, pp. 731-32).[fn 4] Individuals would retain precisely 
the same rights under state and federal law that they had prior to 
the enactment of the special protections repealed by Amendment 
2. Supporters of the Amendment claimed that the extension of 
minority status or preference laws to include sexual orientation 
would be tantamount to granting special rights, which are not 
enjoyed by the public at large. Indeed, as one of the civil rights 
experts observed,  
 
"every civil rights provision ends up awarding special privileges. 
And, it does that because the property right is vested in the 
owner. The right to rent or dispose is one of the great and 
honored roots in our society. So if you redefine a class that has a 
right to limit your discretion in disposal and use, you have 
transferred the property right from the prior title holder to this 
class. And, that constitutes a very large privilege."  
 
v. 17, p. 1194. 
 
Amendment 2 faced significant opposition, including many 
prominent figures and organizations, such as the Governor, the 
Colorado Civil Rights Commission, the American Civil Liberties 
Union, the League of Women Voters, at least 300 Denver area 
religious leaders, and most of the newspapers in the State (v. 15, 
pp. 740-43, 787; v. 16, pp. 1044, 1050). Amendment 2's 
opponents outspent its supporters by a nearly 2-1 margin (v. 15, 
pp. 747-48; v. 16, p. 1046; Df. Ex. S). Even so, the people 
approved Amendment 2 after a spirited campaign which the trial 
court found to be a classic example of democratic self-
government:  
 
"[W]hat I saw was a group of Colorado citizens who wanted to 
present an initiative to the voters. They said we would like the 
voters of Colorado to look at this. So they acquired signatures. 
They presented things to the state government. They followed the 
political process, and they got it on the ballot. And they lobbied 
for or were part of a lobbying effort for the passage of the 
Amendment, and that involved spending money and presenting 
their views.  
 
There was absolutely nothing wrong with that. As a matter of 
fact, this is exactly in keeping with the political process that this 
country is based on. And this Court, should there be an attack on 
that process, would vigorously defend those persons who have 
been involved with that process because they have followed 
exactly what democracy urges."  
 
Pet. App. E-10. 
 
C. Colorado Supreme Court Opinions. 
 
The cornerstone of the Colorado Supreme Court's first opinion in 
this case was its conclusion that "laws may not create unequal 
burdens on identifiable groups with respect to the right to 
participate in the political process absent a compelling state 
interest." Pet. App. D-14. According to the majority, this concept 
found its "most explicit, and nuanced, articulation" in Hunter v. 
Erickson, 393 U.S. 385 (1969), and its progeny. Pet. App. D-14. 
[fn 5] Interpreting Hunter as not limited to "special burdens on 
racial minorities within the governmental process," the court 
below found that Amendment 2 infringed upon a "fundamental 
right to participate equally in the political process" because 
homosexuals and bisexuals were no longer "free to appeal to 
state and local government for protection against discrimination 
based upon their sexual orientation ...." Pet. App. D-14, D-25 and 
D-27.  
 
In its second opinion, the Colorado Supreme Court reaffirmed its 
core holding, addressed the various governmental interests 
asserted by the State, and held that Amendment 2 is 
unconstitutional under strict judicial scrutiny. Pet. App. B-7 
through B-22.  
 
Justice William H. Erickson dissented in both appeals because 
the majority had blurred "fundamental rights" cases with "suspect 
class" cases, and selectively used language from each, to create a 
heretofore unknown federally-mandated group-based 
fundamental right. Pet. App. B-37; Pet. App. D-42 through D-43. 
Justice Erickson found that this Court's decisions, as well as the 
analysis of constitutional scholars, refute the existence of any. 
such fundamental right. Rather, he said, this Court's cases 
support strict-scrutiny review only where a suspect class is 
adversely affected by a restructuring of the political process. Pet. 
App. D-55. In Justice Erickson's view, the appropriate standard 
of review under the Equal Protection Clause is the rational basis 
test, and Amendment 2 easily satisfies this test. Pet. App. B-46 
through B-53.  
 
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT 
 
The question in this case is even more "extraordinary" than the 
one in Washington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 458 U.S. at 459. 
Here, local governments and individual citizens seek to use the 
Fourteenth Amendment not to protect a racial minority, but to 
immunize from preemption special protections that have been 
conferred upon homosexuals and bisexuals.  
 
The Colorado Supreme Court has created out of whole cloth a 
new fundamental "group right" not to be "fenced out" from 
unfettered political participation at all levels of government. This 
theory embodies a revolutionary change in the structure of state 
and local political authority, subverting the rule this Court has 
followed for almost 150 years that "the sovereignty in every 
State resides in the people of the State, and . . . they may alter 
and change their form of government at their own pleasure." 
Luther v. Borden, 48 U.S. (7 How.) 1, 47 (1849). See also 
Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 462 (1991). The reasoning of 
the court below does profound violence to settled understandings 
of the authority of, and respect for, popular government at the 
state level. It does so without the remotest support in any prior 
decision of this Court. Applying either general equal protection 
analysis or fundamental rights analysis, the decision below 
should be reversed.  
 
A. 
 
The intent and effect of Amendment 2 is to withdraw a deeply 
divisive social and political issue from elected representatives 
and place its resolution squarely in the hands of the people. Core 
principles of federalism have led this Court to grant States 
"extraordinarily wide latitude," Holt Civic Club v. City of 
Tuscaloosa, 439 U.S. 60, 71 (1978), in such internal allocations 
of authority among political institutions. Rare in any context, 
heightened scrutiny is almost never appropriate where, as here, 
the challenged state action goes to the heart of state sovereignty. 
Thus, on its face, Amendment 2 carries with it a strong 
presumption of constitutionality.  
 
B. 
 
This Court's decisions recognize one clear exception to the rule 
that state allocations of decisionmaking power are presumed 
constitutional, viz., when the state action constitutes a 
"meaningful and unjustified official distinction based on race." 
Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. 385, 391 (1969); Seattle School 
Dist., 458 U.S. at 470. However, any claim that Respondents 
should be accorded the same "suspect class" treatment as racial 
minorities has been strategically waived by Respondents both in 
the Colorado Supreme Court and in this Court.  
 
C. 
 
Because federal judicial interference with sensitive and core 
political choices involves an extraordinary departure from the 
traditional approach demanded by our federalist system, this 
Court has steadfastly refused to extend Hunter beyond the 
context of racial minorities. James v. Valtierra, 402 U.S. 137, 
141 (1971). This Court should follow that course in this case.  
 
The new fundamental "group right" recognized below finds no 
support in any previous decision of this Court, and certainly not 
in the voting cases relied upon by the lower court. -See Reynolds 
v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964); Kramer v. Union Free School 
Dist., 395 U.S. 621 (1969). Nothing in Amendment 2 deprives 
anyone of a right to vote, or to have access to the ballot, or to 
petition government or to exercise any other fundamental right. 
Amendment 2 merely reserves to the people the issue of special 
protections for homosexuals and bisexuals. Thus, the voting 
cases on which the court below relied support the 
constitutionality of Amendment 2, which is itself the product of a 
popular vote. Respondents retain complete freedom to employ 
the same democratic processes that led to Amendment 2, to 
reallocate power in the future in ways that they regard as~ more 
appropriate.  
 
Furthermore, it is simply impossible, under this Court's equal 
protection jurisprudence, to characterize an independently 
identifiable group's ability to define the agendas of all levels of 
government as a "fundamental right." In fact, this Nation's 
history and traditions authoritatively preclude any such 
conclusion. Seattle School Dist., 458 U.S. at 480 n.23. Finally, 
the "identifiable group-political participation" theory adopted by 
the Colorado Supreme Court, if upheld, would cast constitutional 
doubt on a wide range of state and federal legislation, because 
the definition embraces virtually every conceivable group. No 
persuasive rationale has been offered by the court below or 
Respondents to support this proposed sea change in the law.  
 
D. 
 
Amendment 2 is properly subject to rational basis scrutiny and 
readily satisfies that standard. This Court has held that it "will 
not overturn. . . a statute unless the varying treatment of different 
groups is so unrelated to the achievement of any combination of 
legitimate purposes that we can only conclude that the 
legislature's actions were irrational." Vance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. 
93, 97 (1979). Amendment 2 unquestionably is rationally related 
to a number of legitimate state interests, including three which 
the lower courts found so convincing as to be "compelling" 
(albeit, not narrowly tailored).  
 
The interests advanced by Amendment 2 fall into three general 
categories. First, given limited resources, the people of Colorado 
plainly could conclude that anti-discrimination protections 
should be reserved for those who are particularly deserving of 
special protection. Second, eliminating anti-discrimination 
provisions that compel landowners and religious institutions to 
open their facilities to homosexuals and bisexuals is a rational 
means of protecting the legitimate prevailing preferences of the 
State's population. Moreover, eliminating the regulatory burdens 
on privacy and associational interests embodied in the local laws 
that Amendment 2 preempted, furthers the rational basis which 
has variously been described as "that government is best which 
governs least." Finally, a single uniform rule has inherent 
advantages for efficient law enforcement. Eliminating divergent 
legal standards is certainly a legitimate choice that also 
eliminates the city-by-city and county-by-county political battles 
that prevailed prior to Amendment 2. In sum, Amendment 2 is a 
rational means of implementing legitimate governmental goals 
and as such it is plainly constitutional.  
 
ARGUMENT 
 
AMENDMENT 2 DOES NOT VIOLATE THE EQUAL 
PROTECTION CLAUSE OF THE FOURTEENTH 
AMENDMENT.  
 
Ike Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause is 
"essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated Center, 
473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985). The "general rule is that legislation is 
presumed to be valid and will be sustained if the classification 
drawn by the statute is rationally related to a legitimate state 
interest. " Id. at 440. This general rule of deference gives way 
only in those rare instances when statutes either utilize "suspect" 
or-"quasi-suspect" classifications, or infringe upon fundamental 
constitutional rights. Id. at 440-41. And where, as here, the 
challenged decision is a State allocation of authority among 
political subdivisions, this Court has recognized that intrusive 
heightened scrutiny is almost never appropriate.  
 
No suspect class, quasi-suspect class, or fundamental right is 
implicated here. Nor can the new "right" recognized by the court 
below be upheld under any accepted method of constitutional 
analysis. To the contrary, affirmance would work a revolution in 
this Court's equal protection jurisprudence, and would deeply 
undermine traditional self-government.  
 
A. A State's Allocation of Authority Between Political 
Subdivisions Should Not Be Disturbed Absent Exceptional 
Circumstances.  
 
Through Amendment 2, a majority of Colorado citizens 
rationally chose to withdraw consideration of the question of 
special legal protections for a concededly non-suspect class from 
their state and local governmental bodies. It placed this issue 
exclusively in the hands of the people, preserving Respondents' 
rights to employ the same electoral process to overturn 
Amendment 2, if they persuade their fellow citizens that such a 
course would be more appropriate. The decision below is nothing 
less than a direct attack on the way the people of Colorado have 
chosen to govern themselves, through allocating power between 
themselves and their elected representatives -- a matter that 
indisputably goes to the heart of state sovereignty. See, e.g., 
Luther v. Borden, 48 U.S. (7 How.) at 47 ("the sovereignty in 
every State resides in the people of the State, and . . . they may 
alter and change their form of government at their own 
pleasure").  
 
Of course, "[q]uestions of federalism are always inherent in the 
process of determining whether a State's laws are to be accorded 
the traditional presumption of constitutionality, or are to be 
subjected instead to rigorous judicial scrutiny. " San Antonio 
Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1 (1973). There 
is no area in which the presumption of constitutionality finds 
stronger support than a State's discharge of its "constitutional 
responsibility for the establishment and operation of its own 
government...." Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. at 462; cf. Coyle 
v. Oklahoma, 221 U.S. 559 (1911). Thus, this Court has 
consistently recognized that equal protection "scrutiny will not 
be so demanding where we deal with matters resting firmly 
within a State's constitutional prerogatives. " Gregory v. 
Ashcroft, 501 U.S. at 469 (quoting Sugarman v. Dougall, 413 
U.S. 634. 648 (1973)).[fn 6]  
 
These bedrock principles of federalism demand that this Court 
accord States "extraordinarily wide latitude. . . in creating various 
types of political subdivisions and conferring authority upon 
them " or in withdrawing authority from them. Holt Civic Club 
v. City of Tuscaloosa, 439 U.S. 60, 71 (1978). This is in accord 
with the long-standing rule observed by this Court that:  
 
"Municipal corporations are political subdivisions of the State, 
created as convenient agencies for exercising such of the 
governmental powers of the State as may be entrusted to them. 
The State, therefore, at its pleasure may modify or withdraw all 
such powers, . . . conditionally or unconditionally, with or 
without the consent of the citizens, or even against their protest. 
In all of these respects the State is supreme, and its legislative 
body conforming its action to the state constitution, may do as it 
will, unrestrained by any provision of the Constitution of the 
United States."  
 
Hunter v. City of Pittsburgh, 207 U.S. 161, 178-79 (1907).  
 
"Judicial incursions in this area may interfere with those aspects 
of democratic self-government that are most essential to it," 
Cabell v. Chavez-Salido, 454 U.S. 432, 440 (1982), and 
Respondents therefore bear an especially heavy burden in urging 
this Court to create new "fundamental rights" that would justify 
heightened scrutiny of a wide range of decisions at the heart of 
state sovereignty.  
 
B. There is No Suspect or Quasi-Suspect Class Issue in this Case.  
 
Both the Colorado Supreme Court and Respondents expressly 
recognize that this is not a "suspect" or "quasi-suspect" class 
case. This Court has held that only five classifications are 
entitled to heightened scrutiny,[fn 7] and has been reluctant to 
extend that scrutiny to additional classifications. See Cleburne, 
473 U.S. at 441. Indeed, despite numerous invitations, this Court 
has declined to do so-for over seventeen years. This Court has no 
occasion to consider that question here: as Respondents 
themselves admit, after an extensive trial, the trial court rejected 
their claim that they qualified for suspect or quasi-suspect class 
protection,[fn 8] and they did not appeal that ruling. Opp. at 14; 
see also Pet. App. B-6 n.3.  
 
Indeed, Respondents not only chose for strategic reasons not to 
preserve the issue in proceedings below, but also, in urging this 
Court to deny certiorari, they expressly relied upon that choice as 
a reason for denying the petition. Opp. at 14; see, e.g., City of 
Springfield v. Kibbe, 480 U.S. 257, 258-59 (1987) (dismissing 
writ as improvidently granted where argument was neither 
briefed nor argued to the court of appeals nor raised at the 
petition stage); Yee v. City of Escondido, 503 U.S. 519,___, 112 
S. Ct. 1522, 1533 (1992) (Court considers questions not raised at 
the petition stage only in "the most exceptional cases").  
 
Here, then, the issue is simply whether Amendment 2 infringes 
upon a heretofore unknown federally-guaranteed fundamental 
right. As the Colorado Supreme Court admitted, this "right" is 
not directly attributable to any case or set of cases decided by this 
Court, but rather to a "principle" intuited from four separate, 
distinct lines of authority. Pet. App. D-13 through D-14. For the 
reasons that follow, none of those lines of authority -- either 
separately or together -- supports the extraordinary group right 
utilized by the court below to strike down Amendment 2.  
 
C. There is No Fundamental "Right" for Every "Independently 
Identifiable Group" to Unfettered Participation at Every Level of 
Government.  
 
1. This Court's Decisions in Hunter v. Erickson and Its Progeny 
Do Not Support the Fundamental Right Identified by the 
Colorado Supreme Court.  
 
Our system of government presumes that "even improvident 
decisions will be rectified by the democratic process and that 
judicial intervention is generally unwarranted no matter how 
unwisely we may think a political branch has acted." Vance v. 
Bradley, 440 U.S. at 97.[fn 9] Except where otherwise required 
by the Constitution, "[i]t is not the province of this Court to 
create substantive constitutional rights in the name of 
guaranteeing equal protection of the laws." San Antonio 
Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. at 33 (public 
education not a fundamental right).  
 
The "right" of every independently identifiable group to 
participate fully in all phases of the political process identified by 
the Colorado Supreme Court has no basis in the text of the 
Constitution. Nor, as the court below acknowledged, has this 
Court ever recognized any such "right." Indeed, if anything, this 
Court has repeatedly rejected it, as evidenced by the line of cases 
commencing with Hunter v. Erickson, upon which the court 
below so heavily relied. Under Hunter and its progeny, the Equal 
Protection Clause only prohibits efforts to realign the political 
process in a manner designed to harm a racial minority. 
Inexplicably, the Colorado Supreme Court invoked this same line 
of cases to reach the exact opposite conclusion.  
 
In Hunter, this Court reviewed an amendment to a city charter 
that repealed a racial anti-discrimination ordinance, and required 
voter approval before such an ordinance could be put into effect. 
Characterizing the amendment as placing "special burdens on 
racial minorities within the governmental process," this Court 
observed:  
 
"Because the core of the Fourteenth Amendment is the 
prevention of meaningful and unjustified official distinctions 
based on race, racial classifications are "constitutionally suspect" 
and subject to the "most rigid scrutiny." They "bear a far heavier 
burden of justification" than other classification."  
 
393 U.S. at 391-92 (citations omitted). 
 
Notwithstanding the facial clarity of this Court's holding, the 
Colorado Supreme Court reasoned that the "complexity" of the 
Hunter opinion indicated that the decision could not be based 
solely on race. Thus, the court below concluded that a general 
right to participate politically must have been a central element 
of this Court's holding. The Colorado Supreme Court's 
interpretation turns the opinion in Hunter on its head.[fn 10] The 
difficult analysis in Hunter was not the concern for political 
participation, but instead was the problem of determining 
whether Hunter was a racial minority case. If political 
participation had been the linchpin of the analysis, it would have 
been wholly unnecessary to decide the much more difficult issue 
whether the facially neutral city ordinance constituted a 
"meaningful and unjustified official distinction based on race. " 
393 U.S. at 391. See Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239 
(1976). And this Court's comprehensive analysis of that issue 
demonstrates plainly that race was the determinative factor in the 
case.[fn 11]  
 
Two years later, this Court unequivocally refused to extend 
Hunter to non-suspect classes. James v. Valtierra, 402 U.S. 137 
(1971), concerned the validity of a California constitutional 
provision prohibiting state public bodies from developing, 
constructing, or acquiring low income housing projects without 
prior approval by a majority vote in a city, town, or county 
referendum. A lower court had ruled, based on its reading of 
Hunter, that the California measure unconstitutionally 
discriminated against poor people in the exercise of their right to 
seek redress from governmental authorities. This Court 
disagreed, finding that, unlike in Hunter,  
 
"it cannot be said that California's Article XXXIV rests on 
"distinctions based on race." . . . The present case could be 
affirmed only by extending Hunter, and this we decline to do. 
[Respondents] suggest that the mandatory nature of the Article 
XXXIV referendum constitutes unconstitutional discrimination 
because it hampers persons desiring public housing from 
achieving their objective, when no such roadblock faces other 
groups seeking to influence other public decisions to their 
advantage. But, of course, a law-making procedure that 
"disadvantages" a particular group does not always deny equal 
protection."  
 
Id. at 141-42 (emphasis supplied). 
 
In its initial opinion, the Colorado Supreme Court rewrote James 
by characterizing it as ''best understood as a case declining to 
apply suspect class status to the poor, and not as a limitation on 
Hunter." Pet. App. D-20 through D-21 n.21. That 
characterization is mystifying. Hunter did not apply to the poor, 
because poverty is not a suspect classification, much less a racial 
classification. That reasoning should control this case as well.  
 
In Seattle School Dist., this Court again reaffirmed race as the 
touchstone for the Hunter doctrine. There this Court invalidated a 
voter-initiated statute which removed the power of school boards 
to order busing to desegregate schools. This Court confirmed that 
"the political majority may generally restructure the political 
process to place obstacles in the path of everyone seeking to 
secure the benefits of governmental action." It is only "when the 
State allocates governmental power nonneutrally, by explicitly 
using the racial nature of a decision to determine the 
decisionmaking process" that a different analysis is required. 458 
U.S. at 470 (emphasis in original). Indeed, as the majority noted, 
the core rationale of this line of cases is:  
 
"when the State's allocation of power places unusual burdens on 
the ability of racial groups to enact legislation specifically 
designed to overcome the `special condition' of prejudice, the 
governmental action seriously `curtail[s] the operation of those 
political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect 
minorities.' In a most direct sense, this implicates the judiciary's 
special role in safeguarding the interests of those groups that are 
`relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to 
command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political 
process.'"  
 
Id. at 486 (emphasis supplied) (citations omitted).[fn 12]  
 
Thus, Hunter, James, and Seattle School Dist.[fn 13] call for 
strict scrutiny only when the political process has been 
restructured to place unusual burdens upon "those groups . . to 
command extraordinary protection from-the majoritarian 
political process." Seattle School Dist., 458 U.S. at 486; see also 
James, 402 U.S. at 141-42. The case is, therefore, this simple: the 
Hunter rule comes into play only to protect racial minorities -- or 
at its most expansive, members of a suspect class.[fn 14] Thus, 
Hunter provides no support for the holding below.[fn 15]  
 
2. Amendment 2 Does Not Infringe the Right to Vote or Any 
Other Recognized Right Relating -- to Political Participation.  
 
The Colorado Supreme Court also claimed support for its 
decision from cases such as Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 
(1964) and Kramer v. Union Free School Dist., 395 U.S. 621 
(1969). Those cases concern the fundamental right to vote, not 
the "identifiable group right to political participation" intuited by 
the court below. Reynolds v. Sims, for example, stands for the 
proposition that the right to vote, read together with the Equal 
Protection Clause, requires the representation of like numbers of 
people, rather than geographic areas. And Kramer v. Union Free 
School Dist. held only that the right to vote may not be voided on 
the basis of whether one is a property owner or a parent.  
 
At root, these voting cases involve the ~ process of electing 
representatives. They do not concern the range of issues that all 
voters may or may not vote upon. They certainly do not implicate 
a restructuring of the overall political process. See, e.g., Mrazek 
v. Suffolk County Bd. of Elections, 630 F.2d 890, 898 (2d Cir. 
1980) ("The one-person, one-vote doctrine requires no more, and 
does not create rights and privileges beyond the warranty of 
mathematical equivalency of votes"). And Amendment 2 does 
not present a case where homosexuals and bisexuals have been 
denied the right to vote in upcoming elections,[fn 16] or where 
reapportionment or other state action has diluted the value of 
their individual votes.[fn 17]  
 
The court below further attempted to justify its ruling on the 
basis of this Court's decisions in Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U.S. 
23 (1968), and Illinois.State Bd. of Elections v. Socialist 
Workers Party, 440 U.S. 1?3 (1.979). Those cases are likewise 
wholly inapposite. In Williams, this Court held that a complex 
state statutory scheme violated the rights to vote and to associate, 
because it had the effect of excluding from the ballot all but the 
candidates of the two major political parties. In Illinois State Bd. 
of Elections, this Court reviewed a scheme that placed higher 
burdens on new or third-party candidates for local offices than 
for statewide offices. As in Williams, this Court struck down the 
scheme because it placed an unacceptable burden upon the rights 
to vote and to associate. Neither case stands for anything more 
than that the Constitution will not permit burdens on access to 
the ballot which are designed to protect the established parties.  
 
Amendment 2, of course, presents no obstacles whatsoever to 
particular candidates or political parties. Indeed, homosexuals 
and bisexuals have the same access to the ballot -- including the 
initiative process through which Amendment 2 was adopted -- as 
all other Colorado citizens. Rather than burdening any person's 
rights to vote or associate, Amendment 2 simply raises a certain 
issue to a constitutional level. Neither the fundamental right to 
vote, nor the right to petition government, encompasses a right to 
require the state legislature or a local government to entertain 
matters that are beyond its authority to address. See Smith v. 
Arkansas State Highway Employees, Local 1315, 441 U.S. 463, 
464-65 (1979). See also Higginson, A Short History of the Right 
to Petition Government for the Redress of Grievances, 96 Yale 
L.J. 142, 142-43, 159-61, 165-66 (1986).[fn 18]  
 
Respondents continue to have precisely the same rights as 
anyone else who has lost an election. They may continue to 
participate fully in all of Colorado's political processes; what 
they do not have is a right to successful participation in those 
processes. Thus, to the extent they are relevant at all, the voting 
cases support the validity of Amendment 2,-which came about as 
the result of a statewide vote. The right to vote can be infringed 
just as effectively by nullifying votes as by preventing them from 
being cast in the first place;  
 
It is quite apparent, then, that the "'precondition,' 
'reapportionment,' and 'candidate eligibility' cases are not 
dispositive of, or directly controlling on," the case at bar. Pet. 
App. D-13. It is further apparent that the Hunter-doctrine is not 
the "principle [which] unifies these cases, despite the different 
factual and legal circumstances presented in each of them. " Id. at 
D-14. The cases that actually provide a unifying principle 
governing this case are those that hold that, absent a clearly 
applicable constitutional impediment, States are completely free 
to structure their governmental decisionmaking authority without 
judicial interference. Colorado's Amendment 2 fits squarely 
within that principle and therefore should be upheld because it 
rationally serves legitimate governmental purposes.  
 
3. The "Right" Recognized by the Court Below Cannot Be 
Upheld Under the Accepted Constitutional Analysis Embraced 
by this Court.  
 
The group "right" to political participation identified by the court 
below as fundamental is also wholly inconsistent with this 
Court's accepted methodology for identifying fundamental rights. 
At the outset, the decision below is fatally flawed because it blurs 
and attempts to fuse fundamental rights and equal protection 
jurisprudence into a new "substantive equal protection." The 
Equal Protection Clause serves as a mechanism for balancing 
competing constitutional interests. Where a suspect classification 
or fundamental right is present, the balance usually tips in favor 
of the individual. However, the Clause is not, itself, a source of 
fundamental rights; such rights must be found elsewhere in the 
Constitution.  
 
Fundamental rights are those "'implicit in the concept of ordered 
liberty,' such that 'neither liberty nor justice would exist if [they] 
were sacrificed."' Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186, 191-92 
(1986) (quoting Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325, 326 
(1937)). Such rights have also been characterized as "deeply 
rooted in this Nation's history and tradition." Id. (quoting Moore 
v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 503 (1977). The utility 
of these approaches  
 
"lies in their effort to identify some source of constitutional value 
that reflects not the philosophical predilections of individual 
judges, but basic choices made by the people themselves in 
constituting their system of government . . . and they seek to 
achieve this end through locating fundamental rights either in the 
traditions and consensus of our society as a whole or in the 
logical implications of a system that recognizes both individual 
liberty and democratic order."  
 
Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747, 747 (1986) (White, J., dissenting) 
(citation omitted). See Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. at 192-94 
(applying traditions and consensus tests).[fn 19]  
 
The "right" to demand preferential treatment from any level of 
state or local government is neither "deeply rooted in this 
Nation's history and tradition," nor "implicit in the concept of 
ordered liberty." Quite to the contrary~, this "right" represents a 
radical departure from our democratic traditions, and the 
resulting political chaos is the antithesis of any notion of ordered 
liberty. "The fabric of American empire ought to rest on the solid 
basis of the consent of the people. The streams of national power 
ought to-flow immediately from that pure, original fountain of all 
legitimate authority." The Federalist, No. 22 (A. Hamilton) 
(emphasis in original).  
 
The people may legitimately give their consent to their 
government either through elected representatives, or through 
direct participation. "The referendum. . . is a means for direct 
political participation, allowing the people the final decision, 
amounting to veto power, over enactments of representative 
bodies. This practice is designed to 'give citizens a voice on 
questions of public policy."' City of Eastlake v. Forest City 
Enterprises, Inc., 426 U.S. 668, 673 (1976) (quoting James v. 
Valtierra, 402 U.S. at 141). Indeed, in every State, the people 
themselves retain the power to approve or disapprove 
amendments to their respective constitutions,[fn 20] and 
"[p]rovisions for referendums demonstrate devotion to 
democracy, not to bias, discrimination, or prejudice." James v. 
Valtierra, 402 U.S. at 141.[fn 21]  
 
Even a referendum that "disadvantages"~a particular group is 
presumptively valid, unless it targets a suspect class. Id. at 141-
42. Indeed, as recently as 1991, this Court in Gregory v. Ashcroft 
evaluated a State's mandatory retirement scheme for judges under 
the rational basis test, despite the obvious fact the scheme 
discriminated against a group -- the elderly -- which has been, 
and still is, the subject of discrimination. See, e.g., Massachusetts 
Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 313 (1976).  
 
As was the case in Gregory, the people retain the right to decree 
that these decisions may be made only at the highest level: the 
state constitution. There simply is no "vested constitutional right 
to local decisionmaking, " Seattle School Dist., 458 U.S. at 480 
n.23; for this reason, Colorado, like other States,  
 
"permits persons who are dissatisfied at a local level to appeal to 
the state legislature or the people of the State for redress. It 
permits the people of a State to pre-empt local policies, and to 
formulate new programs and regulations. Such a process is 
inherent in the continued sovereignty of the States. This is our 
system. Anytime a State chooses to address a major issue some 
persons or groups may be disadvantaged. In a democratic system 
there are winners and losers. But there is no inherent unfairness 
in this and certainly no constitutional violation."  
 
Seattle School Dist., 458 U.S. at 496 (Powell, J., dissenting).[fn 
22]  
 
Rather than permitting the range of issues associated with 
homosexuality to be widely debated and determined through the 
political process, however, the Colorado Supreme Court has 
determined that the federal Constitution dictates the terms of 
political debate. Its decision slashes across core constitutional 
values of state sovereignty and self-government, making any 
distinction made by government in the establishment of its 
political structure vulnerable to constitutional attack. It is 
indisputable that under this Court's well-settled precedent the 
Colorado General Assembly was constitutionally free not to pass 
laws giving homosexuals and bisexuals protected status, to repeal 
any such previously enacted laws, and to refuse to pass any 
similar laws in the future. See Crawford v. Los Angeles Bd. of 
Educ., 458 U.S. 527 (1982).  
 
In Crawford, this Court upheld a California constitutional 
amendment prohibiting state courts from ordering race-based 
public school student assignments, unless required under the 
federal Constitution. "[H]aving gone beyond the requirements of 
the Federal Constitution, the State was free to return in part to the 
standard prevailing generally throughout the United States. " Id. 
at 542. However, under the reasoning of the Colorado Supreme 
Court, the California provision "fenced out" an "identifiable 
group" -- in that case, a suspect class -- from the ordinary 
political process. Nonetheless, this Court upheld the measure 8-1, 
noting that "We reject an interpretation of the Fourteenth 
Amendment so destructive of a State's democratic processes and 
its ability to experiment. This interpretation has no support in the 
decisions of this Court." Id. at 535. Cf. New State Ice Co. v. 
Liebmann, 285 U.S. 262, 311 (1932) Brandeis, J., dissenting).  
 
Crawford controls this case. Through Amendment 2, Colorado 
has simply defined the package of civil rights available to 
homosexuals and bisexuals under the Colorado Constitution as 
no larger than that provided by the Constitution and laws of the 
United States. The only difference between the two cases is that 
Crawford dealt with a suspect classification, and this case does 
not.  
 
Achieving this same result through the people themselves, rather 
than their representatives, can hardly be suspect; indeed, it cannot 
be seriously maintained that the people have less power than 
their elected representatives. Rather, the cornerstone of our 
constitutional system is that the people are the source of all 
governmental authority, and retain the power to control their 
representatives:  
 
"[T]he ultimate authority, wherever the derivative may be found, 
resides in the people alone, and that it will not depend merely on 
the comparative ambition or address of the different governments 
whether either, or which of them, will be able to enlarge its 
sphere over the other. Truth, no less than decency, requires that 
the event in every case should be supposed to depend on the 
sentiments and sanction of their common constituents."  
 
The Federalist, No. 46 (J. Madison). Surely, the traditions of this 
country, and concepts of ordered liberty do not mandate that 
representatives must be masters of their constituents.  
 
4. The Rationale of the Decision Below is Sweeping and its 
Consequences are Devastating.  
 
The "right" identified by the Colorado Supreme Court extends to 
all identifiable groups, and is effectively unqualified. If, as 
Respondents and the courts below concede, sexual orientation is 
not a suspect classification, there plainly is no principled way to 
limit the scope of the group "right" recognized by the Colorado 
Supreme Court. Accordingly, that "right" can be used to attack a 
wide range of routine federal and state legislation.[fn 23]  
 
What makes this result breathtaking is the impossibility of 
confining in any meaningful way the concept of "independently 
identifiable groups" which are entitled to heightened judicial 
scrutiny when they challenge adverse legislative action. Any 
conceivable group, from a boy scout troop to a group of tax 
protestors, fits the definition.  
 
Furthermore, the Hunter doctrine that Respondents seek to 
extend beyond the suspect class context, makes no distinction 
regarding constitutional provisions, and applies with equal vigor 
to statutes, ordinances, and any other governmental action. See 
Hunter v. Erickson (voter-initiated charter amendment); Equality 
Foundation of Greater Cincinnati, Inc. v. City of Cincinnan, 838 
F. Supp. 1235, 1241 (S.D. Ohio 1993), injunction made 
permanent, 860 F. Supp. 417 (S.D. Ohio 1994), appeal filed, 
Nos. 94-3855 and 94-3973 (6th Cir. 1994) (same); Seattle School 
Dist. (voter-initiated statute); and Lee v. Nyquist, 318 F. Supp. 
710 (W.D.N.Y. 1970), aff'd mem., 402 U.S. 935 (1971) (statute 
passed by state legislature).  
 
Consequently, extending the Hunter doctrine to non-racial 
classifications calls into question every federal and state measure 
that draws a distinction between different groups of people -- and 
there are few measures that do not draw such distinctions. 
Although superficially appealing, "identifiable group" analysis 
quickly becomes a morass, as beliefs and conduct become 
blurred with immutable characteristics. See, e.g., Davis v. 
Bandemer, 478 U.S. 109, 147 (1986) (O'Connor, J., concurring) 
("identifiable group" is one "that possesses distinctive interests 
and tends to vote on the basis of those interests," including 
"political, religious, ethnic, racial, occupational, and 
socioeconomic groups"); Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U.S. 725, 754 
n.12 (1983) (Stevens, J., concurring) ("Identifiable groups will 
generally be based on political affiliation, race, ethnic group, 
national origin, religion, or economic status, but other 
characteristics may become politically significant in a particular 
context.")  
 
A vast array of federal tax, regulatory, and social legislation 
affects groups that are "independently identifiable" based upon 
income, occupation, residence, health, age, or any number of 
other factors. State laws that might provide greater benefits or 
protections to any of these groups are preempted if they conflict 
with the purposes of federal legislation. U.S. Const. art. VI. 
Under the Colorado Supreme Court's reasoning, however, every 
such instance of preemption may violate the equal protection 
rights of the affected group to seek additional benefits at the state 
or local level  
 
Moreover, Colorado, like other States, through tax, safety, 
environmental, and other legislation, routinely makes distinctions 
between, and imposes burdens on, ''identifiable groups" on the 
basis of income, occupation, property ownership, residency -- 
even sexual orientation.[fn 24] The Colorado Constitution, 
likewise, burdens "identifiable groups" that desire public 
abortion funding, the re-election of incumbent officials, the 
reorganization of certain school districts, and certain municipal 
annexations. If homosexuals and bisexuals are "fenced out" by 
Amendment 2's prohibition of special protections, then surely 
those who favor public funding for the fundamental right to an 
abortion are "fenced out" by the restrictions of Colo. Const. art. 
V, Section 50; advocates for any other medical procedure must 
seek only a statute.[fn 25] Those who favor the reelection of 
incumbent state officials are "fenced out" by Colo. Const. art. IV, 
Section 1; Colo. Const. art. V, Section 3. Certainly, the many 
parents who do not want their children included in the Denver 
Public Schools would believe they are "fenced out" by Colo. 
Const. art. XX, Section 7; residents of any other school district 
may divide or reorganize their district by obtaining a statute. The 
citizens of the City and County of Denver are "fenced out" from 
annexing property in the same manner as citizens in other 
municipalities by Colo. Const. art. XX, Section 1 and art. XIV, 
Section 3.  
 
In truth, any distinction made by government in the 
establishment of its political structure would be vulnerable to 
constitutional attack under the lower court's theory. Under the 
Colorado Supreme Court's ruling, any individual voter whose 
cause is unsuccessful in a referendum would be entitled to 
overturn that referendum, simply because the majority imposed 
its will on a minority concern. Major public policy issues could 
never be decisively settled through the political process; 
government would be obliged continually to reconsider every 
policy choice. See Note, The Hunter Doctrine: An Equal 
Protection Theory That Threatens Democracy, 38 Vand. L. Rev. 
397, 428 (1985) ("Taken to its logical extreme, then, the equal 
protection clause could establish a tyranny of the minority, or, 
worse, the courts, over the will of the people.") (emphases in 
original).[fn 26]  
 
The principle adopted by the court below is also incoherent 
because it leads to equally valid constitutional claims on both 
sides of every political issue. For example, under the decision 
below, a state constitutional amendment preempting local 
ordinances that allow public cigarette smoking would violate the 
constitutional right of smokers, an independently identifiable 
group, to have their cause determined at the local level. The 
theory adopted below, however, would give rise to a competing 
and equally valid claim on the other side -- the right of non-
smokers to have their interests decided at the state level. Indeed, 
neither the court below nor Respondents have any principled 
explanation for why the supporters of Amendment 2 do not have 
an equally compelling right to have their interests determined at 
the state level.  
 
Only the clearest constitutional justification could support such 
revolutionizing of traditional methods of government. The desire 
of interest groups to be free of measures designed to place 
ultimate policy decisions in the hands of the people simply 
cannot justify shifting away from a presumption of 
constitutionality in favor of intrusive heightened judicial 
scrutiny.  
 
D. Amendment 2 is Subject to, and ~Readily Satisfies, Rational 
Basis Review.  
 
Because Amendment 2 does not infringe upon any fundamental 
right, its validity depends solely on whether "there is a rational 
relationship between the disparity of treatment and some 
legitimate governmental purpose. " Heller v. Doe, 113 S. Ct. 
2637, 2642 (1993). Under the rational basis test, this Court:  
 
"will not overturn . . . a statute unless the varying treatment of 
different groups is so unrelated to the achievement of any 
combination of legitimate purposes that we can only conclude 
that the legislature's actions were irrational."  
 
Vance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. at 97. Accord Gregory v. Ashcroft, 
501 U.S. at 470-71 (applying rational basis test to state 
constitutional provision). In applying this test, this Court asks 
only whether there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts 
that provide a rational basis for the classification. Heller, 113 S. 
Ct. at 2642. "A State . . rationality of a statutory classification." 
7d. at 2643. Rather, "'the burden is on the one attacking the 
legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis 
which might support it,' whether or not the basis has a foundation 
in the record." Id. Accord Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. at 470-
71; Pennell v. City of San Jose, 485 U.S. 1, 14 (1988).  
 
The rational basis inquiry in this case does not depend upon mere 
theory, however, because the State argued, and presented 
convincing evidence, that in removing or preventing 
governmental regulation in this area, Amendment 2 promotes 
freedom of choice (relating to matters of personal and familial 
privacy, religion, and association), furthers several legitimate 
societal concerns (relating to the integrity of civil rights laws and 
the contours of social and moral norms). and achieves statewide 
uniformity.  
 
Significantly, neither the trial court nor the Colorado Supreme 
Court found any of these purposes to be illegitimate or 
unreasonable. Indeed, between them, the two courts recognized 
that there are three "compelling" public purposes served -- albeit 
inexactly -- by Amendment 2. Those interests were the 
promotion of religious freedom, the promotion of familial 
privacy, and the preservation of associational privacy. Pet. App. 
B-11 and B-13; Pet. App. C-14. Because the means need not be 
narrowly tailored to achieve these ends under the rational basis 
test,[fn 27] these interests would, a fortiori, satisfy that test.  
 
Given the nature of the rational relationship standard, many other 
rational justifications undoubtedly could be established. No 
useful purpose would be served in attempting to canvass 
exhaustively the field of legitimate objectives. Instead, the State 
demonstrated below that the interests identified plainly satisfy 
the rational basis standard.  
 
1. Amendment 2 Maintains the Integrity of Civil Rights Laws.  
 
The supporters of Amendment 2 were acutely aware that laws 
and policies designed to benefit homosexuals and bisexuals could 
have an adverse effect on the ability of state and local 
governments to combat discrimination against suspect classes. 
See An Analysis of 1992 Ballot Proposals, Pet. App. F-8. Owing 
to the state constitutional fiscal constraints which are necessarily 
a part of public administration,[fn 28] unlimited resources are not 
available to combat discrimination. Therefore, it is incumbent 
upon the State to set priorities for its enforcement efforts. 
Amendment 2 is an appropriate means by which the people 
sought to focus government's limited resources upon those 
circumstances most warranting attention. Cf. Bob Jones Univ. v. 
United States, 461 U.S. 574, 604 (1983) (remedying specific 
instances of racial or sexual discrimination is a compelling 
interest); Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 623 
(1984) (same).  
 
When Amendment 2 was proposed, the Colorado Civil Rights 
Commission had voted to recommend to the General Assembly 
that it add sexual orientation protections to the State's civil rights 
statutes. This recommendation was made, despite the fact that the 
Commission's investigative arm, the Colorado Civil Rights 
Division, had experienced steadily increasing demands upon a 
shrinking budget, and the existence of substantial evidence that 
homosexuals and bisexuals were not, as a class, in need of such 
protections (v. 9, p. 19; v. 15, p. 866; v. 16, pp. 1085-91, 1096-
97; v. 17, pp. 1155, 1173).  
 
Here, the State -- like Congress (v. 17, p. 1186) -- could 
legitimately determine that special protections for suspect and 
other needy classes should not give way to demands for inclusion 
of a politically powerful[fn 29] and relatively privileged[fn 30] 
special interest group. Indeed, three former Chairmen of the 
Colorado Civil Rights Commission strenuously opposed the 
inclusion of homosexuals under the ambit of the civil rights 
statute (v. 15, p. 867); one said that such action represented "a 
drastic departure" from the historical aims of the civil rights laws 
(v. 17, p. 1156).[fn 31]  
 
2. Amendment 2 Enhances Individual Freedoms.  
 
Another obvious interest served by Amendment 2 is that it 
enhances individual freedom by eliminating governmental 
interference in the choices people make in religious, familial, 
personal, and associational matters. Both the United States 
Constitution and the Colorado Constitution explicitly recognize 
the importance of religious liberty, U.S. Const. amend. I, Colo. 
Const. art. II, Section 10, and this Court has recognized the 
importance of preserving spheres of personal liberty, e.g., Meyer 
v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923), including a right of intimate 
association. See Board of Directors of Rotary International v. 
Rotary Club of Duarte, 481-U.S. 537, 544 (1987). In truth, these 
interests are, cumulatively, nothing more than the individual 
liberty that this nation has cherished for over two centuries. At 
the heart of that individual liberty is the freedom to make 
personal choices regarding with whom one wishes to associate, 
and how one wishes to be governed.  
 
The concerns surrounding religious liberty are quite obvious and 
substantial. See R. Duncan, Who Wants to Stop the Church: 
Homosexual Rights Legislation, Public Policy, and Religious 
Freedom, 69 Notre Dame L. Rev. 393 (1994). Under the 
ordinances preempted by Amendment 2, individual landlords or 
employers who have sincere and profound religious objections to 
homosexuality would nonetheless be compelled to compromise 
those convictions under threat of government sanctions. See 
Donahue v. Fair Employment & Housing Comm'n, 2 Cal. 
Rptr.2d 32 (Cal App. 2d Dist. 1991), review dismissed, 23 Cal. 
Rptr.2d 591, 859 P.2d 671 (Cal. 1993). See also Df. Aff. 17 
(Artine Yapoujian) (v. 18, p. 1341; v. 19, pp. 1349-51) (employer 
sanctioned because his wife gave religious literature to 
homosexual employee). Thus, Amendment 2 accommodates 
significant and legitimate liberty interests.  
 
The ordinances do not merely restrain the choices available to 
individuals. In Aspen, for example,  13-98 of the sexual 
orientation ordinance required churches to make their facilities 
open to homosexual organizations if they were open to any 
community organization. Pl. Ex. 48 (v. 7, pp. 148-49). Moreover, 
churches apparently could not refuse to hire any employees, 
including clergy, on the basis of their sexual orientation; title 12 
of the Boulder municipal code did not allow a church or religious 
organization with deeply held moral views regarding 
homosexuality to refuse to hire someone based on his or her 
sexual orientation (v. 16, pp. 1068-75). To promote free exercise 
values by withdrawing the authority to adopt legislation in this 
area altogether may not be a tailored response, but it certainly is a 
rational means of ensuring that core religious values are 
protected from infringement.  
 
In addition to religious liberty, Amendment 2, protects notions of 
personal privacy and intimate association. For example, Ann 
Ready of Madison, Wisconsin, testified she shared a house with 
four other women, but refused to share it with a lesbian. She 
stated that she "had rejected several heterosexual males for the 
same reason, namely the potential for [unwanted] physical, 
sexual attraction." Df. Aff. 12 at 5 (v. 18, p. 1341; v. 19, pp. 
1349-51). Ms. Ready was subsequently found to have violated 
both municipal and Wisconsin state sexual orientation laws. Id. 
at 9-10. Preventing this sort of intrusion into personal matters of 
the utmost privacy is a legitimate interest.. "The choice of 
household companions -- of whether a person's 'intellectual or 
emotional needs' are best met by living with family, friends, 
professional associates, or others -- involves deeply personal 
considerations as to the kind and quality of intimate relationships 
within the home." Village of Belle Terre v. Boraas, 416 U.S. 1, 
15 (1974) (Marshall, J., dissenting).  
 
Ordinances of the type repealed by Amendment 2 also affect 
familial privacy and the ability of parents to convey values to 
their children. This Court has expressly acknowledged that:  
 
"the Constitution protects the sanctity of the family precisely 
because the institution of the family is deeply rooted in this 
Nation's history and tradition. It is through the family that we 
inculcate and pass down many of our most cherished values, 
moral and cultural."  
 
Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 503-04 
(1977).[fn 32] The implicit endorsement of homosexuality 
fostered by laws granting special protections could undermine 
the efforts of some parents to teach traditional moral values. It is 
certainly rational for the State to seek to prevent this kind of 
confusion.  
 
The decision of the people of Colorado both to restore and 
preserve these liberties -- as well as an even more general right of 
association or non-association which exists in the absence of 
special protection laws -- is reflective of the time-honored view 
that " [t]hat government is best which governs least."[fn 33] 
Clearly, Amendment 2's restoration and preservation of 
individual freedom, through removal or prevention of 
governmental regulation, is a legitimate public purpose. As this 
Court has recognized,  
 
"The makers of our Constitution undertook to secure conditions 
favorable to the pursuit of happiness. . . . They conferred, as 
against the Government, the right to be let alone -- the most 
comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized 
man.  
 
Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 478 (1928) (Brandeis, 
J., dissenting) (quoted with approval in Stanley v. Georgia, 394 
U.S. 557, 564 (1969), and Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 
453-54 n.10 (1972)).  
 
3. Amendment 2 Achieves Statewide Uniformity and Deters 
Factionalism.  
 
It is advantageous to the State to have uniform civil rights laws, 
both to promote efficient enforcement, and to maximize 
individual liberty, including the preservation of traditional social 
norms. The State also benefits from creating an environment 
where large employers and property owners may operate under 
uniform laws, thereby providing greater economic and legal 
predictability in their affairs. Equally important is the necessity 
of ensuring that the deeply divisive issue of homosexuality does 
not serve to seriously fragment Colorado's body politic. Df. Aff. 
9 (James Hunter) at 14 (v. 18, p. 1341; v. 19, 1349-51).[fn 34]  
 
Ensuring the stability of a State's political system through 
combatting "unrestrained factionalism," such as here, is certainly 
a legitimate, indeed compelling, interest. Storer v. Brown, 415 
U.S. 724, 736 (1974) (upholding statutory provisions barring 
independent candidates from the general election ballot if they 
had been defeated in a party primary that year, or had been 
registered with a political party within the past year); Anderson 
v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 (1983) (noting the importance of the 
State's interest in avoiding political fragmentation in the context 
of elections wholly within state boundaries). Amendment 2 
furthers this interest by eliminating city-by-city and county-by-
county battles over the political issue of homosexuality and 
bisexuality. (v. 17, p. 1196). Consequently, Amendment 2 serves 
an important state interest by promoting statewide uniformity on 
this issue.  
 
*  *  *  * 
 
Amendment 2 infringes upon no fundamental right and is amply 
supported by numerous rational bases. It does not encourage or 
authorize public or private discrimination in contravention of the 
Fourteenth Amendment. While a state or local government can 
grant more protection than that required by the United States 
Constitution, a state or local government can also rescind that 
additional protection -- and prohibit its subsequent reextension -- 
without committing a federal constitutional violation. Crawford 
v. Los Angeles Bd. of Educ., 458 U.S. at 538-39. Amendment 2 
does nothing more.  
 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Colorado 
Supreme Court should be reversed.

2.  Citing Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429 (1984), the trial court 
concluded Amendment 2 infringed upon a so-called fundamental 
"right not to have the State endorse and give effect to private 
biases" affecting "an identifiable class." Pet. App. D-5; Pet. App. 
E-15 through E-17. Respondents did not defend this "right" on 
appeal, characterizing the trial court's ruling as "best construed to 
mean that Amendment 2 violates the plaintiffs' fundamental right 
of political participation ... . " Pet. App. D-6. The Colorado 
Supreme Court accepted Respondents' concession, and in its two 
opinions, never referred to Palmore again.

5.  The Colorado Supreme Court found that this concept was also 
the "common thread which unites" this Court's cases concerning 
preconditions on the right to vote (e.g., Kramer v. Union Free 
School Dist., 395 U.S. 621 (1969)), reapportionment (e.g., 
Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964)), and candidate eligibility

6.  Indeed, the "unique nature of state decisions that go to the 
heart of representative government, " Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 
U.S. 452, 461 (1991), has led this Court to recognize that even 
suspect or quasi-suspect classifications may not trigger 
heightened scrutiny if those classifications are "closely bound up 
with the formulation and implementation of self-government." 
See, e.g., Bernal v. Fainter, 467 U.S . 216, 221 (1984) (upholding 
state provision denying top government posts to non-citizens and 
noting, " [t]he rationale behind the political-function exception is 
that within broad boundaries a State may establish its own form 
of government").

class); Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214, 216 (1944) 
(national ancestry and ethnic origin, suspect class); Graham v. 
Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, 372 (1971) (alienage, suspect class); 
Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 723-24 
(1982) (gender, quasi-suspect class); and Lalli v. Lalli, 439 U.S. 
259, 265 (1978) (illegitimacy, quasi-suspect class).  
 
8.  Every federal appellate court which has considered this 
question has similarly rejected this claim. See, e.g., Steffan v. 
Perry, 41 F.3d 677, 684 n.3 (D.C. Cir. 1994); High Tech Gays v. 
Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office, 895 F.2d 563, reh'g

9.  As Thomas Jefferson once noted: 
 
"[T]he will of the majority, the Natural law of every society, is 
the only sure guardian of the rights of man. Perhaps even this 
may sometimes err. But its errors are honest, solitary and short-
lived. -- Let us then, my dear friends, forever bow down to the 
general reason of the society. We are safe with that, even in its 
deviations, for it soon turns again to the right way."  
 
N.E. Cunningham, In Pursuit of Reason 133-34 (1987).  
 
10.  See R. Duncan & G. Young, Homosexual Rights and Citizen 
Initiatives: Is Constitutionalism Unconstitutional?, 9 Notre Dame 
J. of L., Ethics & Pub. Pol. 93, 119 (1995) (dismissing this 
argument as "uncommonly trivial" because it "overlooks the fact 
that Hunter does not cease to be a 'race' case simply because it is 
not an easy case.... Hunter is a complex and difficult racial 
classification case").  
 
11.  The only support in Hunter for the decision below is the 
isolated comment of this Court that a "State may [not] 
disadvantage any particular group by making it more difficult to 
enact legislation on its behalf ...." Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. 
385, 393 (1969). To be sure, this single reference does not 
explicitly mention race or any other suspect class, but it cannot 
be read outside of the Court's overall analysis of race in that 
opinion. Moreover, any doubt about the sweep of that statement 
should have been eliminated when it was not applied in James v. 
Valtierra. At the end of the day, this one line in Hunter simply 
cannot bear the weight the court below and respondents would 
place on it.  
 
12.  That race was the controlling factor in the decision is 
underscored by this Court's repeated emphasis on the racial 
nature of the classification at issue. E.g., Washington v. Seattle 
School Dist. No. 1, 458 U.S. 457, 470-71, 474, 485-86 (1982).  
 
13.  The Colorado Supreme Court also claimed support for its 
reading of Hunter in Gordon v. Lance, 403 U.S. 1 (1971). See 
Pet. App. D-19 through D-22. This heavy reliance upon Gordon 
is puzzling. There, this Court rejected both approaches employed 
by the court below -- extending the Hunter doctrine beyond racial 
classifications, and expanding the ballot access cases to state 
actions that merely make it more difficult for some kinds of 
governmental actions to be taken. Instead, this Court affirmed a 
single issue supermajoritarian vote requirement. That holding 
thus provides significant support for Amendment 2, not for the 
holding below.  
 
14.  See San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 
411 U.S. 1, 28 (1973) (cited in Seattle School Dist.; "political 
powerlessness" phrase used to describe suspect class); 
Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 313 
(1976) (same; also, correlating the "discrete and insular 
minorities" language of United States v. Carolene Products Co., 
304 U.S. 144, 152-53 n.4 (1938) to the concept of "suspect" 
class).  
 
15.  Professor Tribe's comprehensive analysis also recognizes 
that Hunter and Seattle School Dist. concern discrimination 
against "discrete and insular minorities," rather than "rights of 
political participation." Compare ch. 13 ("Rights of Political 
Participation"), with ch. 16 ("The Model of Equal Protection.") 
L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law (2d ed. 1988). Accord 
Tyler v. Vickery, 517 F.2d 1089, 1099 (5th Cir. 1975), cert. 
denied, 426 U.S. 940 (1976) (characterizing Hunter as striking 
"down a city charter amendment requiring voter approval of 
certain antidiscrimination ordinances on the ground that the 
amendment created a classification based on race"); Lee v. 
Nyquist, 318 F. Supp. 710, 718-20 (W.D.N.Y. 1970), aff'd mem., 
402 U.S. 935 (1971) ("The principle of Hunter is that the state 
creates an 'explicitly racial classification' whenever it 
differentiates between the treatment of problems involving racial 
matters and that afforded other problems in the same area."); 
Arthur v. City of Toledo, 782 F.2d 565, 571-74 (6th Cir. 1986) 
(Hunter, James, and Seattle School Dist. reflect prohibition of 
racial discrimination); Citizens for Responsible Behavior v. 
Superior Court, 2 Cal. Rptr. 2d 648, 655 (Cal. App. 4th Dist. 
1991) ("Hunter was a 'strict scrutiny' case in which the law 
invalidly classified the affected parties on the basis of 
traditionally suspect characteristics"). See also Note, The Hunter 
Doctrine: An Equal Protection Theory That Threatens 
Democracy, 38 Vand. L. Rev. 397, 421-26 (1985) (Hunter 
doctrine limited to state action embodying a racial classification).  
 
16.  Compare Hill v. Stone, 421 U.S. 289 (1975) (invalidating 
provision limiting voters in city bond elections to persons who 
have listed property for taxation); Kramer v. Union Free School 
Dist., 395 U.S. 621 (1969) (invalidating provision limiting voters 
in school district elections to persons owning or leasing taxable 
real property, or parents or custodians of children enrolled in 
schools).  
 
17.  Compare Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964).  
 
18.  If the Colorado Supreme Court is correct that Respondents 
have this broad right, then laws restricting marriage, certain tax 
benefits, and military service to heterosexuals are also 
constitutionally suspect on this ground.  
 
19.  "The danger of expanding rights is clear: expansions of 
'rights' essentially remove power from the democratic process 
and thereby limit the capacity of self-government. It would be 
possible to expand rights so far that self-government itself would 
become a meaningless concept. This danger is particularly acute

27.  Indeed, under that test, courts must "accept a legislature's 
generalization even when there is an imperfect fit between means 
and ends. A classification does not fail rational-basis review 
because it `is not made with mathematical nicety or because in 
practice it results in some inequality.' `The problems of 
government are practical ones and may justify, if they do not

28. Cf. Colo. Const. art. X, Section 20.  
 
29. The spending and voting patterns associated with 
Amendment 2 itself amply demonstrate that homosexuals are 
politically powerful. To date, activists have been successful not 
only in effecting the repeal of sodomy statutes in 27 States (v. 17, 
pp. 1254-55), but also in securing special protections in 
jurisdictions comprising over one quarter of our Nation's 
population. (v. 14, pp. 649, 652). And, among other things, 
through one of the country's largest political action committees, 
they have persuaded Congress to list sexual orientation in the 
federal hate crimes statute. (v. 16, pp. 907, 933; v. 17, pp. 1253-, 
1255, 1257).  
 
30.  Respondents' own witness conceded that "with respect to the 
people who are so identified, it looks like gays, lesbians, and 
bisexuals continue to be more affluent than the average" and 
"[t]end to have higher levels of education." (v. 19, pp. 1414-15). 
Indeed, as one pro-gay rights article put it "gay men and lesbians 
suffer no discernible communal economic deprivation and 
already operate at the highest levels of society: in the boardroom, 
the media, the military, the law, and industry." Df. Aff. 6 (Barry 
Gross) at 26 (v. 18, p. 1341; v. 19, pp. 1349-51). This was in 
accord with the extensive evidence presented by Petitioners. See, 
e.g., v. 16, pp. 920, 932; v. 17, p. 1155; Df. Aff. 9 (James 
Hunter) at 9-10 (v. 18, p. 1341; v. 19, pp. 1349-51); Df. Exs. V

(Overlooked Opinions, Inc. Survey) (v. 16, p. 924).  
 
31.  Indeed, part of the Amendment 2 debate was whether 
granting protected class status would lead to affirmative action 
for homosexuals and bisexuals. (v. 15, pp. 770-71; v. 16, pp. 982, 
1012, 1057-59). In San Francisco, for example, the mayor 
"promised to represent 20 percent of his administration in city 
government with homosexuals" (v. 16, p. 1057), and an 
affirmative action plan for homosexuals has since been 
considered in the City and County of Denver. See Denver Will 
Recruit Homosexual Cops, Rocky Mountain News, Mar. 24, 
1994, at 4A.  See also J.S. Byrne, Affirmative Action for

CHIEF JUSTICE ROVIRA delivered the Opinion of the Court.

JUSTICE SCOTT concurs. JUSTICE ERICKSON dissents.

 Defendants, Roy Romer, Governor of the State of Colorado,
Gale A. Norton, Attorney General of the State of Colorado, and
the State of Colorado (defendants) appeal the trial court's
entry of a permanent injunction enjoining them from enforcing a
voterinitiated amendment to the Colorado Constitution
("Amendment 2"). We affirm.

I In May 1992, petitions which would amend the Colorado
Constitution by adding a new section 30 to article II were filed
with the secretary of state. The proposed amendment was put to
the voters as Amendment 2 on November 3, 1992, and passed by a
vote of 813,966 to 710,151 (53.4% to 46.6%). The secretary of
state certified the results on December 16, 1992, as required by
article V, section 1, of the state constitution.

Amendment 2 provides:

No Protected Status Based on Homosexual, Lesbian, or Bisexual
Orientation. Neither the State of Colorado, through any of its
branches or departments, nor any of its agencies, political
subdivisions, municipalities or school districts, shall enact,
adopt or enforce any statute, regulation, ordinance or policy
whereby homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation, conduct,
practices or relationships shall constitute or otherwise be the
basis of or entitle any person or class of persons to have or
claim any minority status quota preferences, protected status or
claim of discrimination. This Section of the Constitution shall
be in all respects self-executing. On November 12, 1992, Richard
G. Evans, along with eight other persons, the Boulder Valley
School District RE-2, the City and County of Denver, the City of
Boulder, the City of Aspen, and the City Council of Aspen
(plaintiffs) filed suit in Denver District Court to enjoin the
enforcement of Amendment 2 claiming that the amendment was
unconstitutional.

The trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing to consider
plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. Subsequently,
the court granted the motion and prohibited the defendants from
enforcing Amendment 2 pending the outcome of a trial on the
merits.FN1 The defendants appealed pursuant to C.A.R. 1(a)(3),
and we granted review. See Evans v. Romer, 854 P.2d 1270 (Colo.
1993) (Evans I). In Evans I, we first addressed the question of
the legal standard to be applied in reviewing the trial court's
entry of the preliminary injunction. Following the precedent of
the United States Supreme Court, we held that "the Equal
Protection Clause of the United States Constitution protects the
fundamental right to participate equally in the political
process," and "that any legislation or state constitutional
amendment which infringes on this right by 'fencing out' an
independently identifiable class of persons must be subject to
strict judicial scrutiny." Id. at 1282.

After recognizing that "[t]he immediate objective of Amendment 2
is, at a minimum, to repeal existing statutes, regulations,
ordinances, and policies of state and local entities that barred
discrimination based on sexual orientation" and that the
"'ultimate effect' of Amendment 2 is to prohibit any
governmental entity from adopting similar, or more protective
statutes, regulations, ordinances, or policies in the future
unless the state constitution is first amended to permit such
measures," we held:

[T]he right to participate equally in the political process is
clearly affected by Amendment 2, because it bars gay men,
lesbians, and bisexuals from having an effective voice in
governmental affairs insofar as those persons deem it beneficial
to seek legislation that would protect them from discrimination
based on their sexual orientation. Amendment 2 alters the
political process so that a targeted class is prohibited from
obtaining legislative, executive, and judicial protection or
redress from discrimination absent the consent of a majority of
the electorate through the adoption of a constitutional
amendment. Rather than attempting to withdraw antidiscrimination
issues as a whole from state and local control, Amendment 2
singles out one form of discrimination and removes its redress
from consideration by the normal political processes.

Id. at 1285. We concluded that the trial court did not err in
granting the preliminary injunction enjoining defendants from
enforcing Amendment 2.

After our decision in Evans I, the case was remanded to the
trial court to determine whether Amendment 2 was supported by a
compelling state interest and narrowly tailored to serve that
interest. Id. at 1286. At trial the defendants offered six
"compelling" state interests: (1) deterring factionalism; (2)
preserving the integrity of the state's political functions; (3)
preserving the ability of the state to remedy discrimination
against suspect classes; (4) preventing the government from
interfering with personal, familial, and religious privacy; (5)
preventing government from subsidizing the political objectives
of a special interest group; and (6) promoting the physical and
psychological well-being of Colorado children.FN2 The trial
court concluded that the interest in deterring "factionalism"
was in truth, nothing more than an attempt to impede the
expression of "a difference of opinion on a controversial
political question . ..." It concluded that the first
governmental interest was not a compelling state interest but
rather, that "the opposite of defendants' claimed compelling
interest is most probably compelling," i.e., encouraging the
competition of ideas with uninhibited, robust, and wide-open
political debate.

The trial court found that the interest of preserving the
State's political functions, premised on the Tenth Amendment
right of the states to amend state constitutions, was not a
compelling interest since "[d]efendants' legal argument is not
supported by federal or state case law, nor is it supported by
the Colorado Constitution." With respect to the interest in
preserving the ability of the state to remedy discrimination
against groups which have been held to be suspect classes, the
trial court stated its doubt as to whether fiscal concerns of
the state rise to the level of a compelling state interest. The
court held that Amendment 2 could not be understood to further
this interest because, [d]efendants' evidence was principally in
the form of opinion and theory as to what would occur if a
Denver type ordinance were adopted as a state statute. There is
no such statute, nor is one proposed. Plaintiffs' evidence was
based on what has happened over the course of eleven years in
Wisconsin, and during the time in which the Denver ordinance has
included a sexual orientation provision. Those actual
experiences show that the presence of a sexual orientation
provision has not increased costs or impaired the enforcement of
other civil rights statutes or ordinances.

Thus, the trial court concluded that "defendants' offered
evidence of lack of fiscal ability [is] unpersuasive in all
respects." The trial court held that preventing the government
from interfering with personal, familial, and religious privacy
was, in part, a compelling state interest. Although the court
acknowledged promotion of family privacy is a compelling state
interest, it held that defendants never established what they
meant by the term "family." Moreover, defendants failed to

 "tiein . ..the interest of protecting the family and denying
gays and bisexuals the right to political participation . ..."
The trial court also found that preserving religious liberty was
a compelling state interest. However, it held that Amendment 2
was not narrowly tailored to serve this interest. "The narrowly
focused way of addressing [antidiscrimination protections for
gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals] is to add to it a religious
exemption such as is found in the Denver and Aspen ordinances,
not to deny gays and bisexuals their fundamental right of
participation in the political process." The trial court
rejected the personal privacy component of the argument on the
grounds that "[t]he general issue of whether personal privacy is
a compelling state interest was not adequately established. The
court can only speculate as to what defendants mean by personal
privacy and how Amendment 2 protects such a right." The interest
in preventing government from subsidizing the political
objectives of a special interest group was rejected on the
grounds that "[t]his claimed compelling interest was not
supported by any credible evidence or any cogent argument, and
the court concludes that it is not a compelling state interest."
Similarly, the trial court rejected the argument that the
protection of children is a compelling state interest served by
Amendment 2 because "[d]efendants have failed to present
sufficient evidence to support this claimed compelling
interest." Accordingly, because the trial court concluded that
Amendment 2 was not necessary to support any compelling state
interest and narrowly tailored to meet that interest, it
permanently enjoined the enforcement of Amendment 2.FN3 On
appeal the defendants argue that: (1) the legal standard set
forth by this Court in Evans I for assessing the
constitutionality of Amendment 2 should be reconsidered; (2)
Amendment 2 is supported by several compelling state interests
and is narrowly tailored to meet those interests; (3) that the
unconstitutional provisions of Amendment 2 are severable from
the remainder; and (4) Amendment 2 is a valid exercise of state
power under the Tenth Amendment to the United States
Constitution.

II Defendants first ask that we reconsider the constitutional
principles articulated in Evans I, but they offer no arguments
that were not then considered and rejected by this court. We see
no reason to revisit that decision. We reaffirm our holding that
the constitutionality of Amendment 2 must be determined with
reference to the strict scrutiny standard of review.FN4 III A
legislative enactment which infringes on a fundamental right or
which burdens a suspect class is constitutionally permissible
only if it is "necessary to promote a compelling state
interest," Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 342 (1972), and does
so in the least restrictive manner possible. Plyler v. Doe, 457
U.S. 202, 217 (1982). The question of what constitutes a
compelling state interest is one of law and thus, we review the
trial court's ruling de novo. League of United Latin Am.
Citizens, Council No. 4434 v. Clements, 986 F.2d 728, 772 n.30
(5th Cir. 1993); Scott v. Rosenberg, 702 F.2d 1263, 1274 (9th
Cir. 1983). Defendants argue that Amendment 2 is supported by a
number of compelling state interests and is narrowly tailored to
serve those interests.FN5 A Defendants' first asserted
governmental interest is in protecting the sanctity of
religious, familial, and personal privacy. Freedom of religion
is expressly guaranteed by both the First Amendment to the
United States Constitution and article II, section 4 of the
Colorado Constitution and stands at the core of our Nation's
history and tradition. It is among the highest values of our
society. See Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105, 115-17
(1943). There can be little doubt that ensuring religious
freedom is a compelling governmental interest.

Defendants argue that Amendment 2 is necessary to serve this
interest because "[u]nder the ordinances preempted by Amendment
2, individual landlords or employers who have deep-seated and
profound religious objections to homosexuality would nonetheless
be compelled to compromise those convictions, under threat of
government sanctions." In support of this proposition,
defendants rely on Smith v. Commission of Fair Employment &
Hous., 30 Cal. Rptr.2d 395 (Cal. App. 3 Dist. 1994).

In Smith, the plaintiff challenged the ruling of the California
Commission of Fair Employment and Housing which found that she
had impermissibly discriminated, based on their marital status,
against a couple who sought to rent housing. The couple was
unmarried and the plaintiff refused to rent to them on the
grounds that doing so would violate her deeply-held religious
beliefs. Plaintiff was ordered to cease and desist marital
discrimination; post a notice announcing her violation of
California law for ninety days; permanently post a notice to
rental applicants of their rights and remedies under California
antidiscrimination laws; and sign both notices and provide
copies to each person who subsequently expressed an interest in
renting her property. Id. at 397-98.

The California court of appeals concluded that the commission's
order substantially burdened plaintiff's free exercise rights
because she "cannot remain faithful to her religious convictions
and beliefs and yet rent to unmarried couples." Id. at 399.FN6
Assuming arguendo that ordinances such as that in effect in
Boulder, which prohibit discrimination against gay men,
lesbians, and bisexuals in housing and employment but which
contain no exception for religiously-based objections,
substantially burden the religious liberty of those who object
to renting or employing gay men, lesbians, or bisexuals on
religious grounds, the enactment of Amendment 2 clearly is not
narrowly tailored to serve the interest of ensuring religious
liberty. To the contrary, an equally effective, and
substantially less onerous way of accomplishing that purpose
simply would be to require that antidiscrimination laws which
include provisions for sexual orientation also include
exceptions for religiously-based objections. This is precisely
what the Denver antidiscrimination laws provide. Denver, Colo.,
Rev. Mun. Code art. IV, Sub Sect. 28-92, 28-93, 28-95 to 28-97 (1992
Supp.). Similar exemptions for religious organizations are found
in federal antidiscrimination statutes. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. Sect.
2000e-1 (1994 Supp.) (exempting religious organizations from the
prohibition against employment discrimination); 42 U.S.C. Sect. 3607
(1994 Supp.) (exemption for religious organizations in housing
and public accommodation).FN7 Defendants do not, and we doubt
that they could, argue that the Denver ordinance impairs
religious freedom. Indeed, Joseph Broadus, who testified as an
expert witness on behalf of the defendants, testified that
imposing a religiously-based exemption on antidiscrimination
laws intended to protect gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals would
be less restrictive than Amendment 2 and would adequately
address any concerns about religious liberty.

It is clear that Amendment 2, which affects the fundamental
right of gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals to participate equally
in the political process, is not the least restrictive means of
ensuring religious liberty, and is not narrowly tailored to
serve the compelling governmental interest in ensuring the free
exercise of religion.

Defendants also argue that Amendment 2 serves the compelling
interest of preserving "familial privacy." Family privacy is
characterized by defendants as the right "of some parents to
teach traditional moral values" to their children. As support,
defendants cite authority recognizing the sanctity of the family
and the central role the family plays in society. See, e.g.,
Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 503-04 (1977)
("the Constitution protects the sanctity of the family precisely
because the institution of the family is deeply rooted in this
Nation's history and tradition"); Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S.
629, 639 (1968) (parental role is "basic in the structure of our
society").

Defendants contend that the "right of familial privacy" is
"severely undermine[d]" by the enactment of antidiscrimination
laws protecting gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals because "[i]f a
child hears one thing from his parents and the exact opposite
message from the government, parental authority will inevitably
be undermined." This argument fails because it rests on the
assumption that the right of familial privacy engenders an
interest in having government endorse certain values as moral or
immoral. While it is true that parents have a constitutionally
protected interest in inculcating their children with their own
values, see Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166 (1944),
defendants point to no authority, and we are aware of none,
holding that parents have the corresponding right of insuring
that government endorse those values.

The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the
individual's right to profess or practice certain moral or
religious beliefs does not entail a right to have government
itself reinforce or follow those beliefs or practices. See,
e.g., Bowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. 693, 699 (1986) ("Never to our
knowledge has the Court . .. require[d] the Government itself to
behave in ways that the individual believes will further his or
her spiritual development or that of his or her family.").
Furthermore, it is clear that the government does not burden an
individual's constitutional rights merely because it endorses
views with which that individual may disagree. See Block v.
Meese, 793 F.2d 1303, 1312-14 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (then Judge
Scalia concluding that "[a] rule excluding official praise or
criticism of ideas would lead to the strange conclusion that it
is permissible for the government to prohibit racial
discrimination, but not to criticize racial bias; to criminalize
polygamy, but not to praise the monogamous family . .. ."). Id.
at 1313.

Consequently, fully recognizing that parents have a "privacy"
right to instruct their children that homosexuality is immoral,
we find that nothing in the laws or policies which Amendment 2
is intended to prohibit interferes with that right. With or
without Amendment 2, parents retain full authority to express
their views about homosexuality to their children. We believe
that Amendment 2 is neither necessary nor narrowly tailored to
preserve familial privacy because that right is not implicated
by the laws and policies which Amendment 2 proscribes.

Defendants also argue that Amendment 2 serves the compelling
state interest in preserving "personal privacy." While it is
not entirely clear what is meant by the phrase, it appears that
the defendants are referring to the right of "associational
privacy" which will be impaired in the absence of Amendment 2
because individuals may be forced to associate with gay men,
lesbians, and bisexuals in the rental of housing.FN8 As the
Supreme Court has explained, the right of associational privacy
protects associations involving, deep attachments and
commitments to the necessarily few other individuals with whom
one shares not only a special community of thoughts,
experiences, and beliefs but also distinctively personal aspects
of one's life. ...[T]hey are distinguished by such attributes as
relative smallness, a high degree of selectivity in the
decisions to begin and maintain the affiliation, and seclusion
from others in critical aspects of the relationship. As a
general matter, only relationships with these sorts of qualities
are likely to reflect the considerations that have led to an
understanding of freedom of association as an intrinsic element
of personal liberty.

Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 620 (1984).

While preserving associational privacy may rise to the level of
a compelling state interest, Amendment 2 is not narrowly
tailored to serve that interest. Amendment 2 would forbid
governmental entities from prohibiting discrimination against
gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals (because they are gay, lesbian,
or bisexual) in all aspects of commercial and public life, no
matter how impersonal. Amendment 2 affects a vast array of
affiliations which in no way implicate associational privacy.
None of the criteria needed to precipitate associational privacy
rights exists: there is no "special community" distinguished by
"selectivity," "relative smallness," or any concern with
"distinctively personal aspects of one's life." Id.

[A]n association lacking these qualities -- such as a large
business enterprise -- seems remote from the concerns giving
rise to this constitutional protection. Accordingly, the
Constitution undoubtedly imposes constraints on the State's
power to control the selection of one's spouse that would not
apply to regulations affecting the choice of one's fellow
employees.

Id. (citing Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967) and
Railway Mail Ass'n v. Corsi, 326 U.S. 88, 93-94 (1945)).

To the extent that antidiscrimination laws protecting gay men,
lesbians, and bisexuals have the potential to implicate
associational privacy rights, a narrower way of avoiding this
conflict would be to exempt the sort of intimate associations
identified in Roberts from the scope of such laws. For instance,
landlords could be allowed to discriminate against homosexuals
in the rental of owner-occupied housing -- the so-called "Mrs.
Murphy's Boarding House" exception. See, e.g., Fair Housing Act,
42 U.S.C. Sect. 3603(b) (1988 & 1994 Supp.) (exempting certain
owneroccupied housing from the Fair Housing Act); Statutory
History of the United States: Civil Rights, Part II 1741-52,
1805-06 (B. Schwartz ed. 1970) (detailing legislative history
and policies underlying "Mrs. Murphy's Boarding House" exemption
in Fair Housing Act). Similar exemptions already exist under
Colorado law. For instance, Denver's antidiscrimination
ordinance exempts from its housing and public accommodation
provisions multiple unit dwellings of not more than two units
where one of the units is owner occupied. Denver, Colo., Rev.
Mun. Code art. IV, Sub Sect. 2895(b)(2) & 28-96(b)(2) (1991).
Similarly, the Colorado Civil Rights statute exempts from the
definition of "housing" any room offered for rent or lease in a
single-family dwelling occupied in part by the owner. Sect. 24-34
-501(2), 10A C.R.S. (1988).

Amendment 2, however, does no such thing. Rather, it prohibits
governmental entities from enacting laws barring discrimination
against gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals in all contexts,
regardless of the nature of the relationship involved and the
extent of intimacy inherent in those relationships. Amendment 2
sweeps more broadly than necessary and is not narrowly tailored
to serve the governmental interest in preserving associational
privacy.

B Defendants next assert that because "laws and policies
designed to benefit homosexuals and bisexuals have an adverse
effect on the ability of state and local governments to combat
discrimination against suspect classes. ...Amendment 2 is an
appropriate means whereby the people sought to focus
government's limited resources upon those circumstances most
warranting attention." In short, defendants take the position
that Amendment 2 serves the compelling governmental interest in
seeing that limited resources are dedicated to the enforcement
of civil rights laws intended to protect suspect classes rather
than having a portion of those resources diverted to the
enforcement of laws intended to protect gay men, lesbians, and
bisexuals.

It is well-settled that the preservation of fiscal resources,
administrative convenience, and the reduction of the workload of
governmental bodies are not compelling state interests. See,
e.g., Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 76-77 (1971) (interest of
"reducing case-load of probate courts" is not weighty enough to
survive even heightened scrutiny); Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S.
618, 633 (1969); Vlandis v. Kline, 412 U.S. 441, 458-59 (1973)
(it is "obvious . .. that, as the Court's assessment of the
weight and value of the individual interest escalates, the less
likely it is that mere administrative convenience and avoidance
of hearings or investigations will be sufficient to justify what
otherwise would appear to be irrational discriminations.")
(White, J., concurring).

Consequently, we conclude that defendants' asserted interest in
preserving the fiscal resources of state and local governments
for the exclusive use of enforcing civil rights laws intended to
protect suspect classes does not constitute a compelling state
interest.

Assuming that the state has some legitimate interest in
preserving fiscal resources for the enforcement of civil rights
laws intended to protect suspect classes, and recognizing that
combating discrimination against racial minorities and women may
constitute a compelling governmental interest, see Roberts v.
United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 623 (1984), the evidence
presented indicates that Amendment 2 is not necessary to achieve
these goals.FN9 The chief enforcement officer for Denver's
antidiscrimination ordinance testified that Denver's protection
of gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals has not prevented Denver
from protecting other groups or had any significant fiscal
impact on Denver. The chief of Wisconsin's Civil Rights Bureau
testified, based on twelve years experience with Wisconsin's
enforcement of its antidiscrimination laws, that protection of
gay, lesbian, and bisexual persons has not limited enforcement
of other parts of the Wisconsin statutes. The trial court found
that protecting gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals from
discrimination "has not increased costs or impaired the
enforcement of other civil rights statues or ordinances."FN10
This finding is supported by the record and substantiates the
conclusion that Amendment 2 is not necessary to serve the
governmental interest asserted.

Even if protecting gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals from
discrimination has some fiscal impact on the state, Amendment 2
is not narrowly tailored to serve that interest. Ensuring that
certain racial, gender, or ethnic groups receive undiminished
funds for civil rights enforcement could easily be accomplished
by ear-marking funds to cover the costs of such enforcement.
Under such an arrangement, any protection for gay men, lesbians,
and bisexuals would have to be funded from sources other than
funds reserved for the protection of the specified suspect
classes. The governmental interest in insuring adequate
resources for the enforcement of civil rights laws designed to
protect suspect classes from discrimination need not be
accomplished by denying the right of gay men, lesbians, and
bisexuals from participating equally in the political process.
Rather, this interest can be served in such way that no persons'
fundamental rights need be denied.

The defendants' second asserted governmental interest in support
of Amendment 2 is neither necessary nor narrowly tailored to
serve that interest.

C Defendants next argue that Amendment 2 "promotes the
compelling governmental interest of allowing the people
themselves to establish public social and moral norms."FN11 In
support of this proposition, defendants define two related norms
which are promoted by Amendment 2: Amendment 2 preserves
heterosexual families and heterosexual marriage and, more
generally, it sends the societal message condemning gay men,
lesbians, and bisexuals as immoral.

The only authority relied on to support the view that the
protection of morality constitutes a compelling governmental
interest is Barnes v. Glen Theater, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991).
Defendants cite the plurality opinion in Barnes for the
proposition that "the State's interest in protecting order and
morality is compelling; substantial; subordinating; paramount;
cogent; strong." Barnes does not support defendants' contention
that protecting public morality constitutes a compelling
governmental interest.

In Barnes, four Justices held that "the public indecency statute
order and morality." Barnes, 501 U.S. at 567 (emphasis added).
Justice Souter provided the fifth vote in Barnes, however he did
not rely "on the possible sufficiency of society's moral views
to justify the limitations at issue." Id. at 582 (Souter, J.,
concurring). Rather, he was of the opinion that the Indiana law
at issue (which prohibited completely nude dancing) was
permissible due to the "State's substantial interest in
combating the secondary effects of adult entertainment
establishments . ..." Id. None of the justices in Barnes
concluded that furthering public morality constitutes a
compelling state interest.

Consequently, defendants have cited no authority to support the
proposition that the promotion of public morality constitutes a
compelling governmental interest, and we are aware of none. At
the most, this interest is substantial. However, a substantial
governmental interest is not sufficient to render constitutional
a law which infringes on a fundamental right -- the interest
must be compelling. See Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S 202, 217 (1982).

Furthermore, even recognizing the legitimacy of promoting public
morals as a governmental interest, it is clear to us that
Amendment 2 is not necessary to preserve heterosexual families,
marriage, or to express disapproval of gay men, lesbians, and
bisexuals. First, we reject defendants' suggestion that laws
prohibiting discrimination against gay men, lesbians, and
bisexuals will undermine marriages and heterosexual families
because married heterosexuals will "choose" to "become
homosexual" if discrimination against homosexuals is prohibited.
This assertion flies in the face of the empirical evidence
presented at trial on marriage and divorce rates. For example,
Wisconsin, the state with the oldest "gay rights" law in the
nation, enacted in 1982, reports that the divorce rate in
Wisconsin declined after the enactment of its antidiscrimination
statute. See Center for Health Statistics, Division of Health,
Wisconsin Dep't of Health & Social Services, 1990 Wisconsin
Vital Statistics Report, at p. 93, Figure 13 (divorce rates in
Wisconsin peak at 3.9 divorces per 1,000 population in 1981 and
decline thereafter to 3.6 divorces per 1,000 population in
1990).

Defendants also argue that the "endorsement" of homosexuality
undermines marriage and heterosexual families because
antidiscrimination laws implicitly endorse that conduct which is
deemed an improper basis for discrimination. We are of the opinion,
however, that antidiscrimination laws make no assumptions about the
morality of protected classes -- they simply recognize that certain
characteristics, be they moral or immoral -- have no relevance in
enumerated commercial contexts. For instance, it is difficult to
imagine how a law which prohibits employers from discriminating
against anyone engaged in off-duty, legal conduct such as smoking
tobacco, see Sect. 24-34402.5, 10A C.R.S. (1994 Supp.), constitutes an
endorsement of smoking.

In short, prohibitions on discrimination against gay men, lesbians,
and bisexuals do not imply an endorsement of any particular sexual
orientation or practices. To the contrary, prohibitions on
discrimination imply at most that termination of employment,
eviction or denial of rental opportunities, denial of insurance
coverage, and other sanctions in commercial contexts based on
sexual orientation are not appropriate ways of advancing even
valid moral beliefs.

Accordingly, we reject defendants' third asserted interest as a
basis for finding that Amendment 2 is constitutionally valid.

D Defendants contend that Amendment 2 "prevents government from
supporting the political objectives of a special interest group."
The only argument offered to substantiate the contention that this
is a compelling state interest is the following observation from
Lyng v. International Union, 485 U.S. 360, 369 (1988): "[A]t the
heart of the First Amendment is the notion that an individual
should be free to believe as he will, and that in a free society
one's beliefs should be shaped by his mind and his conscience
rather than coerced by the State." (quoting Abood v. Detroit Bd.
of Educ., 431 U.S. 209, 234-45 (1977)).

Defendants do not claim that the laws which Amendment 2 is intended
to prohibit constitute an infringement on the First Amendment
liberties identified in Lyng. Similarly, they do not take the
position that those laws amount to a "coerc[ion] by the State" to
believe anything. Rather, they assert that the laws which Amendment
2 is intended to prohibit constitute an implicit endorsement of
homosexuality and that this somehow vitiates the right of
individuals "to make their own judgments on this question . ..."
As explained above, however, we do not believe that
antidiscrimination laws constitute an endorsement of the
characteristics that are deemed an unlawful basis upon which to
discriminate against individuals. See infra pp. 25-26.

More significantly, defendants offer no authority to support the
rather remarkable proposition that the government has a compelling
interest in seeing that the state does not support the political
objectives of a "special interest group."  The state exists for the
very purpose of implementing the political objectives of the
governed so long as that can be done consistently with the
constitution. The fact that some political objectives are promoted
by "special interest groups" is utterly inconsequential. Indeed,
virtually any law could be regarded as a benefit to a "special
interest group."  If defendants' argument had any merit at all, the
compelling state interest defined would justify striking down almost
any legislative enactment imaginable. This is clearly not the law.
No citation of authority is needed to make the point.

We reject defendants' assertion that Amendment 2 is justified by
the compelling governmental interest in not having the state
endorse the political objectives of a special interest group.

E Defendants claim that Amendment 2 "serves to deter factionalism
through ensuring that decisions regarding special protections for
homosexuals and bisexuals are made at the highest level of
government."  More specifically, they argue that "Amendment 2 is
intended, not to restrain the competition of ideas," but "seeks to
ensure that the deeply divisive issue of homosexuality's place in
our society does not serve to fragment Colorado's body politic."
Amendment 2 accomplishes this end by eliminating "city-by-city and
county-by-county battles over this issue." We reject the argument
that the interest in deterring factionalism, as defined by
defendants, is compelling. Political debate, even if characterized
as "factionalism," is not an evil which the state has a legitimate
interest in deterring but rather, constitutes the foundation of
democracy. "[T]here is no significant state or public interest in
curtailing debate or discussion of a ballot measure."  Citizens
Against Rent Control v. City of Berkeley, 454 U.S. 290, 299 (1981).
See also Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U.S. 23, 32 (1968). We fail to see
how the state, which is charged with serving the will of the people,
can have any legitimate interest in preventing one side of a
controversial debate from pressing its case before governmental
bodies simply because it would prefer to avoid political controversy
or "factionalism."  See Police Dep't of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S.
92, 96 (1972) ("government may not grant the use of a forum to people
whose views it finds acceptable, but deny use to those wishing to
express less favored or more controversial views").

In support of the asserted compelling interest in deterring
factionalism, defendants rely on Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724
(1974). Storer involved a state requirement that proponents of any
viewpoint resign from political parties and not run in those
parties' primaries if the proponents intend to run as independent
candidates. The purpose of this neutral election procedure was to
insure that independent candidates were more than merely sore losers
who, having lost one primary, ran as "independents" to satisfy
"short-range political goals, pique, or personal quarrel."  Id. at
735.

Neither Storer, nor any other case we are aware of supports the
proposition that there is a compelling governmental interest in
preventing divisive issues from being debated at all levels of
government by prohibiting one side of the debate from seeking
desirable legislation in those fora. We conclude that the interest
in deterring "factionalism" is not a compelling state interest.

F Defendants argue that each of the governmental interests, while
individually adequate to validate Amendment 2, "are especially so
when considered in the aggregate."  None of the interests
identified by the state is a necessary, compelling governmental
interest which Amendment 2 is narrowly tailored to advance.
Lumping them together as one grandiose (and rather illdefined)
interest makes them no more necessary, compelling, or narrowly
tailored. In this context, the whole is equal, and is as equally
deficient as the sum of its parts.

IV Defendants next argue that the provisions of Amendment 2 are
severable and that only those provisions pertaining to "sexual
orientation" should be stricken as unconstitutional: "Plaintiffs
have only challenged . ..the question of sexual orientation. They
have not claimed or made any suggestion that Amendment 2's
restrictions concerning homosexual or bisexual conduct, practices,
and relationships are in any way constitutionally suspect." In so
arguing, defendants not only mischaracterize plaintiffs' position,
but fundamentally misconstrue the intent of Amendment 2. In
Evans I, we held that Amendment 2 had been shown to a reasonable
probability to be unconstitutional on the grounds that it affected
"the fundamental right to participate equally in the political
process . ...by 'fencing out' an independently identifiable class
of persons .

recognized in Evans I was not limited to sexual orientation as
opposed to restrictions concerning homosexual or bisexual conduct,
practices, and relationships. To the contrary, it was based on the
fact that Amendment 2 sought to deny an independently identifiable
group's right to participate equally in the political process.

"Whether unconstitutional provisions are excised from an otherwise
sound law depends on two factors: (1) the autonomy of the portions
remaining after the defective provisions have been deleted and (2)
the intent of the enacting legislative body." Robertson v. City and
County of Denver, 874 P.2d 325, 335 (Colo. 1994) (quoting City of
Lakewood v. Colfax Unlimited Ass'n, Inc., 634 P.2d 52, 70 (Colo.
1981)).

We hold that the portions of Amendment 2 that would remain if only
the provision concerning sexual orientation were stricken are not
autonomous and thus, not severable. In addition to denying the
right of equal participation in the political process to a group
based on sexual orientation, Amendment 2 also is intended to deny
that same right to persons based on "homosexual, lesbian or
bisexual . ..conduct, practices or relationships . . .." Amendment
2 targets this class of persons based on four characteristics:
sexual orientation; conduct; practices, and relationships. Each
characteristic provides a potentially different way of identifying
that class of persons who are gay, lesbian, or bisexual. These four
characteristics are not truly severable from one another because
each provides nothing more than a different way of identifying the
same class of persons.

The fact that there is no constitutionally recognized right to
engage in homosexual sodomy, see Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186
(1986), is irrelevant. Amendment 2 by no stretch of the imagination
seeks to criminalize homosexual sodomy. While it is true that such
a law could be passed and found constitutional under the United
States' constitution, it does not follow from that fact that
denying the right of an identifiable group (who may or may not
engage in homosexual sodomy) to participate equally in the
political process is also constitutionally permissible. The
government's ability to criminalize certain conduct does not
justify a corresponding abatement of an independent fundamental
right.

V Last, defendants argue that even if Amendment 2 is in conflict
with the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, it
is nevertheless a constitutionally valid exercise of the people's
reserved powers under the Tenth Amendment.FN12  In short, the
argument is that the power to amend the state constitution is
reserved to Colorado's voters under the Tenth Amendment, and even
if the voters amend the state constitution in such a way as to
violate the federal constitution, such an amendment is per se
valid.

In support of this argument, defendants rely on Gregory v.

Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452 (1991). In Gregory, the Supreme Court held
that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act does not apply to
state court judges. In reaching this conclusion, the Court noted
that decisions concerning the necessary qualification of state
court judges "is a decision of the most fundamental sort for a
sovereign entity. Through the structure of its government and the
character of those who exercise government authority, a state
defines itself as a sovereign."  Id. at 460. The court concluded
that "Congressional interference with this decision of the people
of Missouri, defining their constitutional officers, would upset
the usual constitutional balance of federal and state powers."  Id.
(emphasis added).

Gregory applies only to cases involving federal interference with
the qualification of constitutional officers. See, e.g., Equal
Employment Opportunity Comm'n v. Massachusetts, 987 F.2d 64, 68-69
(1st Cir. 1993) (Gregory applies only when federal law interferes
with state's definition of policy-making officials'qualifications);
Tranello v. Frey, 962 F.2d 244, 249 (2d Cir. 1992) (same); May v.
Arkansas Forestry Comm'n, 993 F.2d 632,  63536 (8th Cir. 1993)
(same); Associated Builders & Contractors v.
Perry, 817 F. Supp. 49, 53 n.3 (E.D. Mich. 1992) (same).

States have no compelling interest in amending their constitution
in ways that violate fundamental federal rights. Reitman v. Mulkey,
387 U.S. 369 (1967) (no reserved power to make right to
discriminate a part of the state's basic charter); Lucas v.
Colorado Gen.Assembly, 377 U.S. 713, 736-37 (1964) ("A citizen's
constitutional rights can hardly be infringed simply because a
majority of the people choose that it be.").

We reject defendants' argument that Amendment 2 is a
constitutionally valid exercise of state power under the Tenth
Amendment.

VI The state has failed to establish that Amendment 2 is necessary
to serve any compelling governmental interest in a narrowly
tailored way. Amendment 2 is not severable and not a valid exercise
of state power under the Tenth Amendment. Accordingly, we affirm
the trial court's entry of a permanent injunction barring its
enforcement.

JUSTICE SCOTT concurs. JUSTICE ERICKSON dissents.

JUSTICE SCOTT concurring:

I agree with the majority and join in its opinion and judgment.
Amendment 2 is unconstitutional because it offends the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States
Constitution. I write separately, nevertheless, to suggest that
Amendment 2 impermissibly burdens the right "peaceably to assemble
and petition the government for redress of grievances," a right
guaranteed to every citizen. Hence, the district court's permanent
injunction should be upheld under the Privileges or Immunities
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

I Citizenship, not the good graces of the electorate, is the
currency of our republican form of government. Over 130 years ago,
this nation was engaged in a great Civil War which tested our
constitutional form of government as has no other time in our
history. That great battle, joined to address issues of slavery and
race, actually resolved much more. History teaches us that, in
fact, our nation addressed a question of paramount importance:

whether any state may, by legislative enactment or popular
referendum, deny or refute the Union of the several states and
render asunder the bonds of our constitutional form of government.
Although answered at Appomatox, today we are called upon to answer,
if not resolve, that question once more.

The federal Constitution, as submitted to the various states,
created certain rights which the states cannot diminish. By joining
the Union, Colorado "cannot be viewed as a single, unconnected,
sovereign power, on [which] . ..no other restrictions are imposed
than may be found in its own Constitution."  Fletcher v. Peck, 10
U.S. (6 Cranch) 85, 135 (1810). Writing for the court in Fletcher,
Chief Justice Marshall opined that each state "is a part of a large
empire, . ..is a member of the American Union; and that Union has a
constitution, the supremacy of which all acknowledge, and which
imposes limits to . ..the several states, which none claim a right
to pass."  Id. Thus, within the limits of state sovreignty, most
important questions are decided by the electorate. However, those
matters in which the result intrudes upon a protected liberty or
fundamental right cannot be determined in the voting booth.

The framers originally recognized this potential for harm and
understood that not every issue can be resolved by the vote of a
majority. In The Federalist Papers, James Madison identified the
covenant of "a well constructed Union" as its promise to protect
and preserve inviolate certain rights of all citizens. The
Federalist No. 10, at 42 (J. Madison) (Wills 1982). Madison noted
that under other forms of government, "measures are too often
decided, not according to the rules of justice, and the rights of
the minor party; but by the superior force of an interested and
over-bearing majority."  Id. at 43. Madison further stated:

The interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional
rights of the place . ...If men were angels, no government would
be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor
internal controuls on government would be necessary. In framing a
government which is to be administered by men over men, the great
difficulty lies in this: You must first enable the government to
control the governed; and in the next place, oblige it to controul
itself.


It is of great importance in a republic, not only to guard the
society against the oppression of its rulers; but to guard one part
of the society against the injustice of the other part.

Id., No. 51, at 262 & 264. Appropriately, Madison suggested, the
"cure" rests in a republican form of government -- a Union in which
there is a "tendency to break and control the violence of faction."
Id., No. 10 at 42. The obligation to "guard one part of the society
against the injustice of the other part" exists whether the
oppressive act is the result of referendum or other state action.
Hence, every individual is promised full citizenship under a
written Constitution which, as Justice Harlan opined, "neither
knows nor tolerates classes among citizens." Plessy v. Ferguson,
163 U.S. 537, 559 (1895) (Harlan, J., dissenting).

Judge Robert Bork, addressing the same covenant, wrote of what he
referred to as the "Madisonian dilemma," stating:

The United States was founded as a Madisonian system, which means
that it contains two opposing principles that must be continually
reconciled. The first principle is  self government, which means
that in wide areas of life majorities
are entitled to rule, if they wish, simply because they are
majorities. The second is that there are nonetheless some things
majorities must not do to minorities, some areas of life in which
the individual must be free of majority rule. The dilemma is that
neither majorities nor minorities can be trusted to define the
proper spheres of democratic authority and individual liberty. To
place that power in one or the other would risk either tyranny by
the majority or tyranny by the minority.

Robert H. Bork, The Tempting of America: The Political Seduction of
the Law 139 (1990) (hereinafter "Bork"). Such a dilemma can only be
resolved by resort to a neutral written principal, the
Constitution. We should look first to the text and to the
understanding manifested in the words used by the framers.
McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 421 (1819) (let the
end be "within the scope of the constitution, and all means which
are appropriate . ..which are not prohibited, but consist with the
letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional");
Colorado Ass'n of Public Employees v. Lamm, 677 P.2d 1350, 1353
(Colo. 1984) ("Where the language of the constitution is plain and
its meaning clear, that language must be declared and enforced as
written."); see also Bork at 145 ("If the Constitution is law,
then presumably, like all other law, the meaning the lawmakers
intended is as binding upon judges as it is upon legislatures and
executives."). Where the words of the Constitution are
unambiguous, we need not look further.

II A Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States
Constitution declares: "All persons born or naturalized in the
United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens
of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State
shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or
immunities of citizens of the United States . ..."  U.S. Const.
amend XIV, section 1.FN13  The Fourteenth Amendment, in section 1,
made state citizenship derivative of national citizenship and
transferred to the federal government a portion of each state's
control over civil and political rights.FN14 By the force of an
unfortunate history and a refusal to rely upon the plain text of
the constitution, our Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence has
resulted in a Privileges or Immunities Clause that has been
eclipsed by the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses. As a
consequence, no important line of decision rests solely on the
Privileges or Immunities Clause. Early on, in fact, the original
understanding was virtually written out of the Constitution by the
United States Supreme Court in the  SlaughterHouse Cases, 83 U.S.
(16 Wall.) 36 (1873).

In the Slaughter-House Cases, decided in 1873, a majority of the
Court acknowledged the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment, but limited its effects to those rights
earlier existing under Article IV, without recognizing the
creation of a new national citizenship. In his opinion for the
Court in Slaughter-House Cases, Justice Miller declared that the
rights conferred by national citizenship were those "which owe
their existence to the Federal government, its National character,
its Constitution, or its laws."FN15  83 U.S. (16 Wall.) at 79. A
review of the legislative history, however, will not permit such
an ambivalent view.FN16  The statements of the framers of the
Fourteenth Amendment, Senator Howard and Representative Bingham,
confirm that the Privileges or Immunities Clause was originally
intended to confer and make inviolate certain minimal rights
embodied in national citizenship.FN17 B The Fourteenth Amendment
Privileges or Immunities Clause was patterned after a similar
clause in Article IV, Section 2.FN18 The Fourteenth Amendment
Clause was thought by its framers to be one of the central
elements of section 1. Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., part 3,
p. 2765 (1866) ("This is the first clause, and I regard it as very
important.") (statement of Senator Howard); see generally John H.
Ely, Democracy and Distrust 22 (1980) (hereinafter "Ely"); John
Harrison, Reconstructing the Privileges or Immunities Clause, 101
Yale L.J. 1385 (1992).

The Article IV Privileges and Immunities Clause imposes substantive
limits upon the states. Corfield v. Coryell, 6 F. Cas. 546 (No.
3230) (C.C.E.D.Pa. 1825). In Corfield, Justice Washington held that
this clause protected against state action the privileges "which
are, in their very nature, fundamental; which belong, of right, to
the citizens of all free governments."FN19  Corfield, 6 F. Cas. at
551. Washington went on to state:

What these fundamental privileges are, it would perhaps be more
tedious than difficult to enumerate. They may, however, be all
comprehended under the following general heads: Protection by the
government; the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the right to
acquire and possess property of every kind, and to pursue and
obtain happiness and safety; subject nevertheless to such
restraints as the government may justly prescribe for the general
good of the whole.

Id. at 551-52.

It was this opinion which became the pole star for Representative
Bingham and Senator Howard, the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Presenting the Fourteenth Amendment to the Senate, Senator Howard
disclosed "the views and the motives which influenced that
committee," stating:

To [the privileges and immunities listed in Corfield], whatever
they may be -- for they are not and cannot be fully defined in
their entire extent and precise nature -- to these should be added
the personal rights guarantied and secured by the first eight
amendments of the Constitution; such as the freedom of speech and
of the press; the right of the people peaceably to assemble and
petition the Government for a redress of grievances, a right
appertaining to each and all the people; the right to keep and to
bear arms; the right to be exempted from the quartering of
soldiers in a house without the consent of the owner; the right to
be exempt from unreasonable searches and seizures, and from any
search and seizure except by virtue of a warrant issued upon a
formal oath or affidavit; the right of an accused person to be
informed of the nature of the accusation against him, and his
right to be tried by an impartial jury of the vicinage; and also
the right to be secure against excessive bail and against cruel
and unusual punishments.

decision of our courts and the present settled doctrine is, that
all these immunities, privileges, rights, thus guarantied by the
Constitution or recognized by it, are secured to the citizen solely
as a citizen of the United States and as a party in their courts. ..
therefore, to restrain the power of the States and compel them at
all times to respect these great fundamental guarantees.

Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., part 3, pp. 2765-66 (1866)
(emphasis added).

Senator Howard's list of privileges or immunities, which
incorporated Corfield, was representative rather than exhaustive.
No case has ever attempted to identify the totality of implied
federal rights guaranteed by the Privileges or Immunities clause.
However, in Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U.S. 78 (1908), the Supreme
Court did provide a list of privileges or immunities which it
ecognized: (1) the right to pass freely from state to state;FN20
(2) the right to petition Congress for redress of grievances; (3)
the right to vote for national officers; (4) the right to enter
the public lands; (5) the right to be protected against violence
while in the lawful custody of a United States Marshal; and (6)
the right to inform United States authorities of violation of its
laws. Twining, 211 U.S. at 97. These rights of national
citizenship receive absolute protection in the sense that the
states never could have a legitimate interest in terminating
completely any of these rights. Rotunda & Nowac, Treatise on
Constitutional Law 351 (2d ed. 1992).

III The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the
right to vote is fundamental to the rights of citizenship and to
a free and democratic society. Burson v. Freeman, 112 S. Ct.
1846, 1859 (1992); Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 561-62
(1963); Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 371 (1886). In Evans
I, we held the right to participate equally in the political
process to be a fundamental right. Evans v. Romer, 854 P.2d
1270, 1282 (Colo. 1993).FN21 By "participate equally," although
not assuring any political result, we did contemplate the right
of the people peaceably to assemble andpetition the government
for a redress of grievances. This right to participate, an
attribute of the new national citizenship, was meant by the
framers of the Fourteenth Amendment to be a personal right
guaranteed and secured by the Privileges or Immunities Clause.
See Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., part 3, pp. 2765 -66
(1866).

It should be axiomatic that the right peaceably to assemble and
petition government implies the ability of the duly elected
representatives to respond, if so persuaded or predisposed. Yet,
if enforced, Amendment 2 provides that the state, acting
"through any of its branches or departments, or any of its
agencies, political subdivisions, municipalities or school
districts," shall not "enact, adopt or enforce any statute,
regulation, ordinance or policy" granting to citizens a "claim
of discrimination" based on homosexual or lesbian status or
sexual orientation. Because it would prevent the General
Assembly or other legislative bodies from enacting or adopting
certain new laws and bar the executive department and its
agencies from enforcing existing laws, Amendment 2 effectively
denies the right to petition or participate in the political
process by voiding, ab initio, redress from discrimination. Like
the right to vote which assumes the right to have one's vote
counted, the right peaceably to assemble and petition is
meaningless if by law government is powerless to act.

IV Courts have been reluctant to develop a working
constitutional analysis under the Privileges or Immunities
Clause since the Slaughter-House Cases, and, unfortunately, have
instead built upon the Equal Protection Clause and Due Process
Clause. The Equal Protection Clause, burdened by a history and
analysis beyond this context,FN22 is not the most appropriate of
the Fourteenth Amendment provisions for securing the right to
participate equally in the political process and yet it is the
primary mode of analysis relied upon by the majority in this
case.FN23 Certainly all must now agree that the Fourteenth
Amendment sought to protect citizens from oppression by state
government. The Equal Protection Clause of that amendment
mandates that rights afforded to some are granted equally to
all. See Steven J. Heyman, The First Duty of Government:
Protection, Liberty and the Fourteenth Amendment, 41 Duke L.J.
507 (1991). From time to time the acts of government intervene
in the lives of its citizens.FN24 Under the Equal Protection
Doctrine, such government intervention is subjected to review,
applying at least one of three standards: strict scrutiny,
intermediate review, or rational basis analysis. The applicable
standard of review to be applied depends upon the
characteristics or attributes of the citizens involved. Under
the Equal Protection Doctrine, when such governmental
intervention occurs, such as with the enactment of Amendment 2
in this case, regardless of the standard applied, it is
contemplated that certain abridgements of even fundamental
rights are acceptable. For example, under the strict scrutiny
test, the most exacting standard and that applied by the
majority, state action is "constitutionally permissible [] if it
is 'necessary to promote a compelling state interest,' and [the
state] does so in the least restrictive manner possible." Maj.
op. at 10 (citations omitted) (emphasis in original).

Unlike the Equal Protection Clause, the Privileges or Immunities
Clause guarantees citizens that certain fundamental rights of
national citizenship are inviolate, absent due process.FN25 The
syntax of the Fourteenth Amendment Clause seems inescapably that
of substantive entitlement. According to Ely, "the slightest
attention to language will indicate that it is the Equal
Protection Clause that follows the command of equality strategy,
while the Privileges or Immunities Clause proceeds by purporting
to extend to everyone a set of entitlements." Ely at 24. The
importance of the Privileges or Immunities Clause is that it
does not require varying standards of review and that its
protections are extended to every citizen.

V Under Amendment 2, the rights of citizens "peaceably to
assemble and petition the government for a redress of
grievances" so as to participate freely and equally in the
political process are compromised in a manner prohibited by the
Fourteenth Amendment. Because these political rights are
fundamental and inherent in national citizenship they are
protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause. Accordingly, I
concur.

JUSTICE ERICKSON dissenting:

I respectfully dissent. In Evans v. Romer, 854 P.2d 1270 (Colo.)
(Evans I), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 419 (1993), the majority
crafted a new fundamental right that had never been recognized
by the United States Supreme Court or by any court other than a
federal district court in Ohio that relied on Evans I.
Ironically, judicial review of Amendment 2 has accomplished
exactly what the voters who passed Amendment 2 sought to prevent
-- the majority has effectively created a heightened protection
for homosexuals, lesbians, and bisexuals.

In establishing what is essentially a new substantive due
process right disguised as a previously unrecognized
"fundamental right," the majority disregarded the warnings of
Chief Justice Burger, who stated in his dissent to Plyler v.
Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 244 (1982): "If ever a court was guilty of an
unabashedly result-oriented approach, this case is a prime
example." Chief Justice Burger stated:

Were it our business to set the Nation's social policy, I would
agree without hesitation that it is senseless for an enlightened
society to deprive any children -- including illegal aliens --
of an elementary education. ...However, the Constitution does
not constitute us as "Platonic Guardians" nor does it vest in
this Court the authority to strike down laws because they do not
meet our standards of desirable social policy, "wisdom," or
"common sense." We trespass on the assigned function of the
political branches under our structure of limited and separated
powers when we assume a policymaking role as the Court does
today.

Id. at 242 (citations omitted).

The majority opinion has overlooked a crucial aspect of the case
before us: we are not evaluating an act of the legislature or
pronouncement of the executive -- we are reviewing a
constitutional amendment adopted by the people of the State of
Colorado. While there are certainly some initiated
constitutional amendments that a majority of the electorate may
attempt to visit on a minority that will not pass constitutional
scrutiny, we must not ignore the fact that we are reviewing the
expressed will of the citizens of this state.

In Evans I, we remanded the case to the district court to
determine whether the preliminary injunction sustained by a
majority of this court should be made permanent. The district
court, following Evans I with great precision, made extensive
findings and made the preliminary injunction permanent.
Nevertheless, people of homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual
orientation have never been adjudicated to be a protected class
and the right to participate equally in the political process
has never been determined, apart from Evans I, to be a
fundamental right. Accordingly, I would employ a rational
relation standard to Amendment 2 and vacate the permanent
injunction. For the reasons set forth in my dissent to Evans I,
and for the reasons set forth below, I respectfully dissent.

I The majority relies on Evans I and applies the strict scrutiny
standard of review to Amendment 2 because it holds that the
Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution
guarantees the fundamental right to participate equally in the
political process. Maj. op. at 4; Evans I, 854 P.2d at 1276.
Evans I established this standard of review by assembling
several United States Supreme Court decisions and interpreting
their collective teachings as implying a new fundamental right.
See Evans I, 854 P.2d at 1276 (citing voting cases, ballot
access cases, and "cases involving attempts to limit the ability
of certain groups to have desired legislation implemented
through the normal political processes"). In my view, no
fundamental right or suspect class is implicated by Amendment 2,
and therefore the standard of judicial scrutiny applied by the
majority is erroneous.

A The majority in Evans I extensively reviewed many United
States Supreme Court decisions to reach its conclusion, and
emphasized a line of cases relating to citizen participation in
the political process. See Washington v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No.
1, 458 U.S. 457 (1982); Gordon v. Lance, 403 U.S. 1 (1971);
Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. 385 (1969). The majority in Evans I
interpreted these cases to create the fundamental right to
participate equally in the political process. Properly
understood, however, these cases involve suspect classifications
and not the alleged fundamental right to participate equally in
the political process.

In Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. 385 (1969), the United States
Supreme Court addressed a violation of the Equal Protection
Clause of the federal constitution. Hunter involved a city
charter amendment that repealed a racial anti-discrimination
ordinance and required voter action before such an ordinance
could be enacted. Id. at 387. Although Hunter involved the
political process, the Court invalidated the amendment because
it created an unjustified distinction based on race. The Court
held:

Because the core of the Fourteenth Amendment is the prevention
of meaningful and unjustified official distinctions based on
race, racial classifications are "constitutionally suspect," and
subject to the "most rigid scrutiny." They "bear a far heavier
burden of justification" than other classifications.

Id. at 391-92 (citations omitted). Courts and scholars reviewing
Hunter have recognized that the holding was predicated on an
unconstitutional racial classification. See Tyler v. Vickery,
517 F.2d 1089, 1099 (5th Cir. 1975) (stating that Hunter struck
down an amendment that was based on a racial classification),
cert. denied, 426 U.S. 940 (1976); Lee v. Nyquist, 318 F. Supp.
710, 718 (W.D.N.Y. 1970) ("The principle of Hunter is that the
state creates an `explicitly racial classification' whenever it
differentiates between the treatment of problems involving
racial matters and that afforded other problems in the same
area."), aff'd, 402 U.S. 935 (1971); Citizens for Responsible
Behavior v. Superior Court, 2 Cal. Rptr. 2d 648, 655 (Cal. App.
4 Dist. 1991) (stating that "Hunter was a `strict scrutiny' case
in which the law invalidly classified the affected parties on
the basis of traditionally suspect characteristics"); Michael
Klarman, An Interpretative History of Modern Equal Protection,
90 Mich. L. Rev. 213, 314 (1991) (noting that in place of a
political process theory of equal protection review, racial
classifications are and should be considered presumptively
unconstitutional because they should be irrelevant to decision
-making); Robert H. Beinfield, Note, The Hunter Doctrine: An
Equal Protection Theory that Threatens Democracy, 38 Vand. L.
Rev. 397, 405 (1985) (suggesting that the decision in Hunter is
based on racial classifications).

In Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1, 458 U.S. 457
(1982), the Court applied Hunter and struck down a state-wide
initiative to terminate the use of busing to achieve racial
integration in the public schools. In finding that the
initiative violated the Equal Protection Clause, the Supreme
Court held:

[T]he political majority may generally restructure the political
process to place obstacles in the path of everyone seeking to
secure the benefits of governmental action. But a different
analysis is required when the State allocates governmental power
nonneutrally, by explicitly using the racial nature of a
decision to determine the decisionmaking process. State action
of this kind, the Court said, "places special burdens on racial
minorities within the governmental process," thereby "making it
more difficult for certain racial and religious minorities than
for other members of the community to achieve legislation that
is in their interest." Id. at 470 (emphasis in original)
(citations omitted). The Court thus did not approve of
"distinctions based on race" and struck down the initiative
because it would have created additional burdens for a class of
citizens who have had historical difficulty in changing the
political process. Id. at 486. See Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v.
Federal Communications Comm'n, 497 U.S. 547, 563-65 (1990)
(holding that members of a traditionally suspect class merit
special protection); City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488
U.S. 469, 490-91 (1989) (same); United States v. Carolene
Products Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152-53 n.4 (1938) (noting that
special protection may be offered for "discrete and insular"
minority groups).

 A similar issue was addressed in Crawford v. Board of
Education, 458 U.S. 527 (1982), which was announced on the same
day as Washington. In Crawford, the Court upheld a state
constitutional amendment that prohibited state courts from
ordering mandatory student assignment or transportation. The
Court stated that if the constitutional amendment employed a
racial classification such as the classification in Hunter, the
Court would apply the strict scrutiny standard of review, but
found Hunter inapplicable because the amendment at issue did not
"embody a racial classification." Crawford, 458 U.S. at 536-37.

The fact that the fundamental right created by the majority in
Evans I has never been recognized by the Supreme Court is
evident in two cases, James v. Valtierra, 402 U.S. 137 (1971),
and Gordon v. Lance, 403 U.S. 1 (1971). In James and Gordon, the
Court could have used the fundamental right found in Evans I and
applied strict scrutiny review to strike down constitutional
measures. Instead, in both cases, the Court upheld the
provisions and refused to apply the strict scrutiny standard
enunciated in Hunter.

In James, the Supreme Court upheld the validity of a California
constitutional measure that prohibited state public bodies from
developing, constructing, or acquiring low-income housing
projects until voters approved of the project in a referendum.
Thus, the citizens singled out in James were low-income people
who would qualify for low-rent housing and therefore the Court
did not apply strict scrutiny. The Supreme Court said:

Unlike the case before us, Hunter rested on the conclusion that
Akron's referendum law denied equal protection by placing
"special burdens on racial minorities within the governmental
process." . .. Unlike the Akron referendum provision, it cannot
be said that California's Article XXXIV rests on "distinctions
based on race." . ..The present case could be affirmed only by
extending Hunter, and this we decline to do.

James, 402 U.S. at 140-41.

Similarly, in Gordon, the plaintiffs challenged West Virginia's
constitutional provision that required a sixty-percent approval
for any bonded indebtedness incurred by the political
subdivisions of the state. As in James, the Supreme Court did
not apply the strict scrutiny standard of review because:

Unlike the restrictions in our previous cases, the West Virginia
Constitution singles out no "discrete and insular minority" for
special treatment. ...We are not, therefore, presented with a
case like Hunter, . ..in which fair housing legislation alone
was subject to an automatic referendum requirement. The class
singled out in Hunter was clear -- "those who would benefit from
laws barring racial, religious, or ancestral discriminations."
Gordon, 403 U.S. at 5. James and Gordon demonstrate that strict
scrutiny should not be applied to review a restriction on the
political process unless the restriction singles out a discrete
and insular minority.FN26 The Supreme Court of the United States
has never held, however, that the right to participate equally
in the political process is a fundamental right.

B The development of fundamental rights in our jurisprudence has
never been a matter for ad hoc determination. See Palko v.
Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325 (1937) (stating that fundamental
rights are those that are "implicit in the concept of ordered
liberty," such that "neither liberty nor justice would exist if
[they] were sacrificed"); Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494,
503 (1977) (noting that fundamental rights are liberties that
are "deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition"); see
also Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S 186, 191-92 (1986); Griswold v.
Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 481-86 (1965). Fundamental rights
must be explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the United States
Constitution. San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411
U.S. 1, 33-34 (1973). Among the fundamental rights delineated by
the Supreme Court are the right to vote, the right to interstate
travel, the right to privacy, and the guarantees contained in
the First Amendment. See Police Dep't of Chicago v. Mosley, 408
U.S. 92, 101 (1972) (First Amendment); Shapiro v. Thompson, 394
U.S. 618, 634 (1969) (interstate travel); Harper v. Virginia
State Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 670 (1966) (voting);
Griswold, 381 U.S. at 484 (privacy).

The Court has been reluctant to recognize new rights as
fundamental. See Bowers, 478 U.S. at 195 ("There should be,
therefore, great resistance to expand the substantive reach of
[the Due Process Clauses], particularly if it requires
redefining the category of rights deemed to be fundamental.");
Geoffrey Stone, et al., Constitutional Law, at 831 (1986)
(stating that the Court "has essentially frozen the list of
`fundamental' interests"). The Court has refused to declare
education, housing, the right to refuse medical treatment,
welfare payments, or governmental employment to be fundamental
rights worthy of heightened constitutional protection. See
Cruzan by Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dep't of Health, 497 U.S.
261, 280 (1990) (right to refuse medical treatment);
Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 312
(1976) (employment); Rodriguez, 411 U.S. at 35 (education);
Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 485 (1970) (welfare). Never
before has any court recognized the right to participate equally
in the political process as a fundamental right, the curtailing
of which warrants strict judicial scrutiny.FN27 "It is not the
province of this Court to create substantive constitutional
rights in the name of guaranteeing equal protection of the
laws." Rodriguez, 397 U.S. at 33.

It is crucial to note, however, that even though equal
participation in the political process does not merit strict
scrutiny analysis, the United States Constitution offers
protection for those who may be adversely affected by
legislation. When individuals or groups are singled out, as they
have been here, they may still be protected by the Due Process
Clauses or the Equal Protection Clause.FN28 In this case, the
class of citizens is protected by the Equal Protection Clause.
Accordingly, Amendment 2 must be struck down only if its
challengers can demonstrate that the legislation is not
rationally related to a legitimate state interest.

II During oral argument before this court, counsel for the
plaintiffs-appellees asserted that even if strict scrutiny
review were inappropriate, we should analyze Amendment 2 under a
rational basis standard of review. Counsel noted that in Heller
v. Doe by Doe, 113 S. Ct. 2637, 2642 (1993), the Supreme Court
did not engage in strict scrutiny review because it was not
properly preserved at the lower levels and therefore urged this
court not to preclude rational basis review by ruling merely
under strict scrutiny standards. I find counsel's contention
persuasive and therefore address Amendment 2 under a rational
relation standard.

A In reviewing an act of the legislature or a voter-mandated
constitutional amendment that creates a classification involving
neither a fundamental right nor suspect classes, a court will
review the classification under the "rational basis" standard of
review. See Heller, 113 S. Ct. at 2642; Kadrmas v. Dickinson
Public Sch., 487 U.S. 450, 462 (1988). Under the rational basis
standard of review, the classification will be "upheld against
equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably
conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis
for the classification." Federal Communications Comm'n v. Beach
Communication, Inc., 113 S. Ct. 2096, 2101 (1993); see also
Sullivan v. Stroop, 496 U.S. 478, 485 (1990); Vance v. Bradley,
440 U.S. 93, 111 (1979); Dandridge, 397 U.S. at 484-85. "Such a
classification cannot run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause
if there is a rational relationship between the disparity of
treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose." Heller, 113
S. Ct. at 2642; see also Nordlinger v. Hahn, 112 S. Ct. 2326,
2331-32 (1992).

The inquiry into whether there is a rational basis for the
classification, however, does not authorize "the judiciary [to]
sit as a superlegislature to judge the wisdom or desirability of
legislative policy determinations." New Orleans v. Dukes, 427
U.S. 297, 303 (1976) (per curiam). Instead, a classification
that involves neither suspect classes nor fundamental rights is
accorded a strong presumption of validity. Beach Communication,
113 S. Ct. at 2098; Hodel v. Indiana, 452 U.S. 314, 331-332
(1981); Murgia, 427 U.S. at 314.

Because of the strong presumption of validity, the purpose or
rationale behind the legislation need not be articulated at any
time. Heller, 113 S. Ct. at 2642; Nordlinger, 112 S. Ct. at
2334; Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc. v. Bowers, 358 U.S. 522, 528
(1959). Additionally, the party challenging the classification
bears the burden of "negat[ing] every conceivable basis which
might support it" whether or not it is supported by the record.
Lehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., 410 U.S. 356, 364
(1973); see also Heller, 113 S. Ct. at 2643.

In an effort to ensure that rational basis review does not
become a "license for courts to judge the wisdom, fairness, or
logic of legislative choices," Beach Communication, 113 S. Ct.
at 2101, the reasons articulated are given great deference. See
Id. at 2098 ("[A] legislative choice is not subject to courtroom
factfinding and may be based on rational speculation unsupported
by evidence or empirical data."); Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S.
452, 470-71 (1991) ("In cases where a classification burdens
neither a suspect group nor a fundamental interest, `courts are
quite reluctant to overturn governmental action on the ground
that it denies equal protection of the laws.'") (citation
omitted); Paris Adult Theater I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 62
(1973) ("The fact that a congressional directive reflects
unprovable assumptions about what is good for the people,
including imponderable aesthetic assumptions, is not a
sufficient reason to find that statute unconstitutional.");
Dandridge, 397 U.S. at 485 (noting that a classification does
not fail because "in practice it results in some inequality")
(citation omitted); Metropolis Theatre Co. v. City of Chicago,
228 U.S. 61, 69-70 (1913) ("The problems of government are
practical ones and may justify, if they do not require, rough
accommodations -- illogical, it may be, and unscientific."); see
also Laurence Tribe, American Constitutional Law 1440 (2d ed.
1988) ("Within very broad limits, courts have traditionally
exhibited extreme deference to the legislative definition of
`the general good,' either out of judicial sympathy for the
difficulties of the legislative process, or out of a belief in
judicial restraint generally."); John Nowak, Ronald Rotunda,
Nelson Young, Constitutional Law 596 (2d ed. 1983) ("A majority
of the justices today will uphold governmental classifications
under this standard unless no reasonably conceivable set of
facts could establish a rational relationship between the
classification and an arguably legitimate end of government.");
Mark Strasser, Suspect Classes and Suspect Classifications: On
Discriminating, Unwittingly or Otherwise, 64 Temp. L. Rev. 937,
941 (1991) ("The rational basis test is notoriously weak. When
applied, there is `little doubt about the outcome; the
challenged legislation is always upheld.'") (quoting Murgia, 427
U.S. at 319 (Marshall, J. dissenting)); but see City of Cleburne
v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432, 447 (1985) (striking
down on rational basis review a zoning law that prohibited
mentally retarded individuals from residing in certain areas of
town because the law was based on the "bare . ..desire to harm a
politically unpopular group") (citation omitted). This is so
because:

The Constitution presumes that, absent some reason to infer
antipathy, even improvident decisions will eventually be rectified
by the democratic process and that judicial intervention is
generally unwarranted no matter how unwisely we may think a
political branch has acted. Thus, we will not overturn such a
statute unless the varying treatment of different groups or persons
is so unrelated to the achievement of any combination of legitimate
purposes that we can only conclude that the legislature's actions
were irrational.

Vance, 440 U.S. at 97 (footnote omitted). Although the purposes and
rationale of a voter initiative are even more difficult to assess
than legislative pronouncements, initiatives passed by the citizens
of the state which contain classifications not related to
fundamental rights or suspect classes are also given deference. See
Gregory, 501 U.S. at 470 (applying the rational basis standard to a
constitutional restriction enacted by the people); MSM Farms, Inc.
v. Spire, 927 F.2d 330, 333 (8th Cir. 1991) (applying a rational
basis test to measures adopted through a referendum).

It is the prerogative of the people of the State of Colorado, and
not this or any other court, to weigh the evidence and determine the
wisdom and utility of the purposes behind a measure adopted through
the initiative process. See Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co.,
449 U.S. 456, 469 (1981) (stating that the Minnesota Supreme Court
erred in substituting its judgment for that of the legislature).
Thus, whether in fact Amendment 2 will meet its objectives is not
the relevant question: the Equal Protection Clause is satisfied if
the people of Colorado could have rationally decided that
prohibiting homosexuals, lesbians, and bisexuals from enacting
certain legislation might further a legitimate interest. Hawaii
Housing Auth. v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229, 242 (1984); Clover Leaf
Creamery, 449 U.S. at 466.

Amendment 2 was put to a plebiscite by initiative petitions and
eventually won voter approval by 813,966 votes to 710,151 votes.
Because Amendment 2 was a product of a vote of the citizens of
Colorado, no purpose or rationale for Amendment 2 was explicitly set
forth. See MSM Farms, 927 F.2d at 332 ("Because the law was adopted
through the initiative and referendum process, there is little
traditional legislative history regarding its purpose."). However,
the state has articulated several rationale in this court and in the
district court to establish that the interest behind Amendment 2 is
not only a rational interest but also a compelling state
interest.FN29 III Although only one legitimate state interest
rationally related to the state's goals for a constitutional
amendment is necessary, the state has set forth several. The
district court found that two rationale -- the promotion of
religious freedom and the promotion of family privacy --
demonstrated compelling state interests, although it found that the
means for achieving the interests were not narrowly tailored to
achieve the objectives.FN30  In my view, there are at least three
interests that satisfy the constitutional standard and those
asserting the invalidity of Amendment 2 have not met their burden of
demonstrating that there is no rational basis for the constitutional
amendment.

A The state asserts that the rational basis of Amendment 2 is that
it prevents the government from interfering with religious privacy.
The root of the state's contention is that under ordinances
preempted by Amendment 2, individual landlords or employers,
including churches, who have profound religious objections to
homosexuality, would nonetheless be compelled to compromise those
convictions under threat of government sanctions. Thus, Amendment 2
prevents any political body from enacting legislation that would
hinder the right of individuals to choose who to rent to or who to
employ on religious grounds. The district court found that
"[p]reserving religious freedom is a compelling state interest" but
that Amendment 2 was "not narrowly drawn to achieve that purpose in
the least restrictive manner possible." Freedom of individuals to
practice and hold particular religious beliefs is among the highest
values in our society. See Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105,
115-17 (1943); Jones v. Opelika, 319 U.S. 103, 104 (1943); see also
Martin v Struthers, 319 U.S. 141, 149-50 (1943) (Murphy, J.,
concurring). It is not within the discretion of this or any court to
determine which beliefs are valid because "courts are not the
arbiters of scriptural interpretation."  United States v. Lee, 455
U.S. 252, 257 (1982). In fact, "religious beliefs need not be
acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to others in
order to merit [free exercise] protection."  Thomas v. Review Bd.,
450 U.S. 707, 714 (1981). Not only is it impermissible for courts to
determine the validity of religious practices and beliefs, but no
government official or body may delineate what is a "proper" form of
faith and require citizens to act in accordance with
government-mandated religious standards. See West Virginia State Bd.
of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943) ("If there is any
fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no
official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in
politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or
force citizens to confess by work or act their faith therein.").

Nevertheless, not all burdens on religion are unconstitutional. Lee,
455 U.S. at 257; Thomas, 450 U.S. at 718 (stating that "only those
interests of the highest order . .. can overbalance legitimate
claims to the free exercise of religion"). Even the highest values,
including religious freedom, must sometimes give way to the greater
public good. See Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 403 (1963). Thus,
governmental actions that substantially burden a religious practice
must be justified by a compelling governmental interest. Employment
Div. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 883 (1990).
In this case, the state asserts that Amendment 2 is an attempt to
protect religious freedom by precluding legislation that would
threaten sanctions against those who would refuse to employ or
rent to homosexuals, lesbians, and bisexuals. The state
indicates several examples of instances in which individuals or
groups were forced to set aside their religious beliefs based on
legislative enactments protecting homosexuals. In Aspen, for
example, section 13-98 of the sexual orientation ordinance
required churches to open their facilities to homosexual
organizations if the facilities were opened to any community
organization. Churches apparently could not refuse to hire
employees, including pastors or priests, on the basis of their
sexual orientation. Similarly, Title 12 of the Boulder Municipal
Code did not allow a church or religious organization with
deeply held moral and religious views on the subject of
homosexuality to refuse to hire someone based on his or her
sexual orientation.

In my view, the state has a legitimate interest in protecting
religious freedoms and Amendment 2 bears a rational relationship
to that interest.

B Although the district court found that the state did not have
a compelling interest in deterring "factionalism," or "political
fragmentation," the state does have a legitimate interest in
promoting state-wide uniformity and Amendment 2 is rationally
related to that interest.

Prohibiting local action on matters affecting the entire state
is advantageous inasmuch as the state has an interest in
uniformity of regulation:

The central inquiry implicit in the concept of pre-emption is
whether there should be statewide uniformity in the regulation
of specific conduct. If there is no need for statewide
uniformity, there is no need for state law to preempt local
power to regulate. . .This is the core of the preemption
question -- to consider, on the one hand, the need for statewide
uniformity of regulation of a specific type of conduct, and, on
the other hand, the need of local governments to be able to
respond to local, as distinguished from statewide problems.

Daniel R. Mandelker & Dawn C. Netsch, State and Local Government
in a Federal System 237 (1977); see also Osborne M. Reynolds,
Local Government Law 120 (1982) (stating that the critical
inquiry in the context of state preemption of local law is:

"[I]s this an area where it is desirable to have a single, all
-encompassing scheme of regulation, so that local laws -- not
just local laws that conflict with the state's, but any local
laws -- would unduly complicate the picture?"); Charles S.
Rhyne, The Law of Local Government Operations Sect. 19.11
(recognizing that preemption is rooted in the necessity of
statewide uniformity of regulation).

In determining what is a matter of statewide concern, this court
has not set forth a strict legal standard. Instead, we have
determined the nature of the concern on an ad hoc basis. See
Denver & Rio Grande Western R.R. Co. v. City & County of Denver,
673 P.2d 354, 358 (Colo. 1983). In City & County of Denver v.
State, 788 P.2d 764, 767 (Colo. 1990), we stated:

Although we have found it useful to employ the "local," "mixed,"
and "state-wide" categories in resolving conflicts between local
and state legislation, these legal categories should not be
mistaken for mutually exclusive or factually perfect
descriptions of the relevant interests of the state and local
governments. Those affairs which are municipal, mixed or of
statewide concern often imperceptibly merge.

State regulation is a matter of statewide concern in a broad
variety of contexts. See Robertson v. City & County of Denver,
874 P.2d 325, 350 (Colo. 1994) (Erickson, J., dissenting).

In this case, the state has a legitimate interest in promoting
Amendment 2 because it is a matter of statewide concern.
Amendment 2 involves a matter of statewide concern because the
public is deeply divided over the issue of homosexuality.FN31
In fact, civil rights has never been the type of concern
reserved exclusively for local governments.FN32 By adopting
Amendment 2, the people of the state have sought to ensure that
the government will act on a uniform basis. Several local
governments, such as Denver, Aspen, and Boulder enacted sexual
orientation laws, while others did not. By voting to approve
Amendment 2, the voters of Colorado indicated that they wanted a
statewide resolution of the issue that had formerly only been
locally regulated and subject to great debate. The citizens of
the state have a right to the initiative process which resolves
conflicts between municipal and local governments when the issue
is a matter of statewide concern and the process is not
repugnant to the constitution.FN33 The Supreme Court has noted
that "referendums demonstrate devotion to democracy, not to
bias, discrimination, or prejudice."FN34 James, 402 U.S. at
141.

In my view, the state has a legitimate interest in promoting
statewide uniformity in matters of statewide concern and
Amendment 2 bears a rational relationship to that interest.

C The state also contends that it has a legitimate interest in
allocating its resources. Specifically, the state suggests that
laws prohibited by Amendment 2 would drain the state's financial
and labor resources set aside and budgeted for the protection of
traditionally suspect classes and diminish respect for
traditional civil rights categories.

In this case, the testimony reflected that, although there was
no current statute that required the state to enforce civil
rights legislation on behalf of homosexuals, lesbians, and
bisexuals, any such statute would decrease the funding available
to enforce existing laws protecting traditionally suspect
classes.FN35 For example, the investigative arm of the Civil
Rights Commission has experienced steadily increasing demands
upon a shrinking budget. Two out of the last three years, the
Division has been unable to fulfill its part of a federally
funded work-share agreement.FN36 The Division received
complaints from the black community that claims were not being
thoroughly investigated and prosecuted. The state, therefore,
reasonably postulates that a law requiring the protection of an
additional group would further stretch scarce resources, and
Amendment 2 protects the civil rights enforcement for
traditionally suspect groups.FN37 Thus, the decision of the
people of the State of Colorado to allocate government resources
in a particular manner is a legitimate state interest in this
case. See Dukes, 427 U.S. at 303 (upholding a New Orleans
ordinance noting that states have wide latitude in regulating
their local economies); James, 402 U.S. at 143 (noting that a
referendum procedure "ensures that all the people of a community
will have a voice in a decision which may lead to large
expenditures of local governmental funds" and therefore found
that a referendum measure did not violate the Equal Protection
Clause).

Additionally, the state has a legitimate interest in ensuring
that the traditionally suspect classes remain respected. See
Crawford, 458 U.S. at 539 ("And certainly the purposes of the
Fourteenth Amendment would not be advanced by an interpretation
that discouraged the States from providing greater protection to
racial minorities."). Professor Joseph Broadus testified that
the addition of homosexuals to civil rights statutes or
ordinances would lessen the public's respect for historic civil
rights categories. Testimony also indicated that, unlike the
traditionally suspect classes, homosexuals, lesbians, and
bisexuals are a relatively politically powerful and privileged
special interest group. Indeed, former Civil Rights Commission
Chairman Ignacio Rodriguez testified that the inclusion of
homosexuals as a suspect class would represent a "drastic
departure" from the historical aims of the civil rights laws.

The State of Colorado, through entities such as the Colorado
Civil Rights Division, has attempted to further the interest in
remedying specific instances of sexual and racial discrimination
through existing civil rights laws and enforcement programs.
However, owing to the fiscal constraints which are inevitably a
part of public administration, unlimited funds are not available
for this purpose. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the state to
set priorities for its enforcement efforts. In this case, the
setting of priorities is a legitimate state interest and
Amendment 2 is rationally related to that interest.

IV In my view, the correct standard of judicial review of
Amendment 2 is a rational basis standard of review.
Additionally, the plaintiffs have not shown that Amendment 2 is
not rationally related to the state's legitimate interest in
protecting religious freedom, encouraging statewide uniformity
in the law, and allocating resources. Accordingly, I would
reverse the decision of the district court and vacate the
injunction. Therefore, I dissent.

FN1 The trial court concluded that plaintiffs had met the
threshold requirement of Rathke v. MacFarlane, 648 P.2d 648
(Colo. 1982), by demonstrating that enjoining the enforcement of
Amendment 2 was necessary to protect their right to equal
protection of the laws under the United States Constitution. The
trial court then determined that because Amendment 2 may burden
a fundamental constitutional right, its constitutionality must
be assessed by reference to the "strict scrutiny" standard of
review. The court concluded that under this standard, plaintiffs
had shown to a reasonable probability that Amendment 2 would be
demonstrated to be unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt at
a trial on the merits.

FN2 The state has not reasserted the sixth interest on appeal.

FN3 The court rejected plaintiffs' argument that gay men,
lesbians, and bisexuals should be found to be either a "suspect
class" or a "quasi-suspect class." The trial court rejected
this argument because it concluded that "[h]omosexuals fail to
meet the element of political powerlessness and therefore fail
to meet the elements [necessary] to be found a suspect class."
This ruling has not been appealed and thus, we do not address
it.

The trial court also declined plaintiffs' request to analyze the
constitutionality of Amendment 2 under the "rational basis
test." In so doing, it stated:

The Colorado Supreme Court has ruled that Amendment 2 invades a
fundamental right of an identifiable group and that the test to
be applied is the strict scrutiny test. The rational basis test
is to be used when there is no fundamental right or suspect
class involved. Therefore this court declines to apply a legally
inappropriate test to this case.

Plaintiffs have again argued to this court that Amendment 2 does
not pass constitutional muster under the less stringent rational
basis test. They argue that each of the state's purported
compelling interests are not rationally related to the enactment
of Amendment 2. Because we decline to revisit our holding in
Evans I, see infra Part II, and again conclude that Amendment 2
affects a fundamental right, its constitutionality must be
analyzed under the strict scrutiny standard of review. See
Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 217 (1982) ("laws that impinge upon
the exercise of a 'fundamental right' [require] the State to
demonstrate that its classification has been precisely tailored
to serve a compelling governmental interest").

FN4 After this court decided Evans I, a Federal District Court
enjoined the enforcement of a voter enacted amendment to the
Cincinnati, Ohio city charter almost identical to Amendment 2,
which prohibited the city from enacting any ordinance,
regulation, rule or policy which entitled gay men, lesbian or
bisexual individuals to minority or protected status. Equality
Foundation of Greater Cincinnati, Inc. v. City of Cincinnati,
838 F. Supp. 1235 (S.D. Ohio 1993) (Equality I). The court found
it highly likely that the right to participate equally in the
political process is a fundamental right, protected by the Equal
Protection Clause and requires strict judicial scrutiny on
review. The court concluded relevant Supreme Court precedent
supported the proposition that "[s]tates may not disadvantage
any identifiable group, whether a suspect category or not, by
making it more difficult to enact legislation on its behalf."
Id. at 1241 (citing Evans I, 854 P.2d 1270, 1281, 1283 (Colo.
1993); Gordon v. Lance, 403 U.S. 1, 7 (1971); Hunter v.
Erickson, 393 U.S. 385, 393 (1969)). After a trial on the
merits, the court made the injunction permanent holding inter
alia that the amendment violated the plaintiffs' fundamental
right to equal access to the political process. Equality
Foundation of Greater Cincinnati, Inc. v. City of Cincinnati,
Slip op. at 26, 1994 WL 442746 at *11 (S.D. Ohio 1994). The
court explained "any legislation that disadvantages an
independently identifiable group of people by making it more
difficult for that group to enact legislation in its behalf,
`fences' that group out of the political process, and thereby
violates their fundamental rights." Id. (citing Equality I, 838
F. Supp. at 1238-42; Evans I, 854 P.2d at 1282.).

FN5 We note at the outset that defendants argue that all of the
asserted compelling interests which support Amendment 2 are
narrowly tailored on the grounds that "there is absolutely no
other way that the people could further the common elements of
the various compelling interests but through the enactment of
Amendment 2." We do not specifically address this argument for
two reasons. First, as will be made clear below, none of the
interests identified by defendants are compelling. Second,
defendants never articulate what the "common elements of the
various compelling interests" are, and we are simply unable to
ascertain any specific "common elements" which all of those
interests share.

FN6 Nevertheless, the court held, "it is clear that free
exercise of religion as protected by the First Amendment is not
actionably infringed by applying to plaintiff a facially neutral
statute which merely proscribes marital status discrimination,
notwithstanding plaintiff's religious scruples against renting
to unmarried couples." Id. at 401. This conclusion was reached
based on the fact that "if prohibiting the exercise of religion
effect of a generally applicable and otherwise valid provision,
the First Amendment has not been offended." Id. at 400 (quoting
Employment Div., Ore. Dept. of Human Res. v. Smith, 494 U.S. at
878 (1990)).

FN7 We do not rule today on the adequacy of any religious
exemptions contained in existing antidiscrimination laws. The
question whether antidiscrimination laws violate the free
exercise clause of the First Amendment by prohibiting
discrimination based on marital status has recently been
addressed by two state supreme courts with mixed results. See
Attorney General v. Desilets, 636 N.E.2d 233 (Mass. 1994)
(Statutory mandate that landlords cannot discriminate against
cohabitating unmarried couples substantially burdened landlords'
sincerely held religious belief protected by the Massachusetts
state constitution. Case remanded to decide whether a compelling
governmental interest in eliminating such discrimination
justified the infringement); Swanner v. Anchorage Equal Rights
Comm'n, 874 P.2d 274 (Alaska 1994) (enforcement of facially
neutral fair housing laws did not violate a landlord's right to
free exercise of religion under either the state or federal
constitution).

FN8 The defendants' entire argument addressing the issue of
personal privacy constitutes a single paragraph. It reads:

The court below found that both religious liberty and familial
privacy are indeed compelling interests. However, the court
rejected the notion that personal privacy could be a compelling
interest, finding that the Defendants had addressed it only
"tangentially." This finding ignores testimony such as that
offered by Ann Ready of Madison, Wisconsin, who shared a house
with four other women, but refused to share it with a lesbian.
She stated that she "had rejected several heterosexual males for
the same reason, namely the potential for [unwanted] physical,
sexual attraction." Ms. Ready was subsequently found to have
violated both municipal and state sexual orientation laws. That
preventing this sort of intrusion into personal matters of the
utmost privacy is a compelling interest, should be obvious.

(citations to the record omitted).

FN9 In this regard, it is significant to note that Colorado law
currently proscribes discrimination against persons who are not
suspect classes, including discrimination based on age, Sect. 24
-34402(1)(a), 10A C.R.S. (1994 Supp.); marital or family status,
Sect. 24-34-502(1)(a), 10A C.R.S. (1994 Supp.); veterans' status,
Sect.
28-3-506, 11B C.R.S. (1989); and for any legal, off-duty conduct
such as smoking tobacco, Sect. 24-34-402.5, 10A C.R.S. (1994 Supp.).
Of course Amendment 2 is not intended to have any effect on this
legislation, but seeks only to prevent the adoption of anti
-discrimination laws intended to protect gays, lesbians, and
bisexuals.

FN10 The trial court rejected the testimony of the defendants'
witnesses who, while having no experience in the enforcement of
civil rights laws intended to protect gays, lesbians, and
bisexuals, speculated that doing so would create increased costs
and limit the ability to enforce laws intended to protect
suspect classes.

FN11 There is some dispute as to whether consideration of this
asserted interest is properly before this court. Plaintiffs
point out that in contrast to the six governmental interests
addressed by the trial court, morality was not listed in the
state's disclosure certificate or the state's opening statement
at trial as a separate interest supporting Amendment 2.

Defendants argue that it presented the interest in public
morality to the district court and as support, cites an
introductory paragraph contained in its brief to that court
which stated that "the issue of public morality . ..permeates
the discussion of compelling interests and indeed, can be
regarded as a compelling interest in its own right." In our
judgment, this is sufficient to conclude that the interest of
public morality was presented to the trial court as a rationale
for Amendment 2 and thus, this asserted interest is properly
before this court.

FN12 The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution
provides: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the
Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved
to the States respectively, or to the people."

FN13 The words "privileges" and "immunities" first appear in
the Constitution in article IV, Sect. 2 ("The Citizens of each State
shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens
in the several States."). By virtue of Article IV, state
citizenship carries with it the right to nondiscriminatory
treatment within each state of citizens of all the states.

Consistent with the text and for purposes of distinction, the
Article IV clause will be referred to as the "Privileges and
Immunities Clause," and the Fourteenth Amendment clause will be
referred to as the "Privileges or Immunities Clause."

FN14 It is widely agreed that section 1 of the Fourteenth
Amendment was intended at least to empower Congress to pass the
Civil Rights Act of 1866, ch. 31, 14 Stat. 27. William Nelson,
The Fourteenth Amendment: From Political Principle to Judicial
Doctrine 104 (1988) ("Section one was added to the amendment at
least in part to remove doubts about the constitutionality of
the 1866 act."); John Harrison, Reconstructing the Privileges or
Immunities Clause, 101 Yale L.J. 1385, 1389 (1992). Many
commentators have suggested that the amendment actually writes
the substance of the 1866 Act into the Constitution. See id.

FN15 Subsequent cases suggested an even narrower definition of
the rights of national citizenship, but in Twining v. New
Jersey, 211 U.S. 78 (1908), the Court in dictum finally settled
on the Slaughter-House definition as correct.

FN16 As Justice Field observed in dissent, and it is not really
possible to deny:

If this inhibition . ..only refers, as held by the majority of
the court in their opinion, to such privileges and immunities as
were before its adoption specially designated in the
Constitution or necessarily implied as belonging to citizens of
the United States, it was a vain and idle enactment, which
accomplished nothing, and most unnecessarily excited Congress
and the people on its passage."

FN22 Historically, the Equal Protection Clause was called upon
to protect insular minorities. Similarities undoubtedly exist
between unlawful discrimination based on sexual orientation and
that based on race or national origin. However, the record is
uncertain as to whether, as a general matter, victims of
discrimination based on sexual orientation share the same
history or are subjected to a similar experience or condition as
victims of racial or ethnic discrimination.

FN23 The defendants argue that the participation in the
political process plaintiffs seek is a particular end or the
successful adoption of plaintiffs' views. I note, however, that
the right to participate in the political process does not
guarantee plaintiffs or any other qualified electors the success
of any candidate or cause nor the state's embracement of
particular ideas. This right simply guarantees access to the
political process. Citizens may vote, petition or amend as a
matter of right, but they cannot necessarily win as a matter of
right.

Moreover, I am not unmindful that the state may deny the right
to vote or participate in the political process as an operation
of due process. See, e.g., Moran v. Carlstrom, 846 P.2d 862, 874
(Colo. 1989) (the General Assembly may place reasonable
restrictions on the right to vote); see also People v. Russo,
713 P.2d 356, 360 (Colo. 1986) (jurors disqualified if they do
not have the right to vote by reason of criminal conviction).

FN24 Government intervention may take the form of agency
action, legislation, constitutional amendment, or other conduct
which has the effect of law.

FN25 See supra, n.11.

FN26 Homosexuals, lesbians, and bisexuals have never been
adjudicated to be a discrete and insular minority by the Supreme
Court. See High Tech Gays v. Defense Indus. Sec. Clearance
Office, 895 F.2d 563, 571 (9th Cir. 1990); Dahl v. Secretary of
the United States Navy, 830 F. Supp 1319, 1323-25 (E.D. Cal.
1993).

FN27 Recently, however, a federal district judge, relying on
Evans I, struck down an anti-gay-rights measure approved by
Cincinnati voters. In Equality Foundation of Greater Cincinnati,
Inc. v. City of Cincinnati, slip op. at 26 (S.D. Ohio Aug. 9,
1994), the federal district court declared that a City Charter
Amendment was unconstitutionally vague and violated the First
Amendment right of homosexuals to participate in the political
process. See also Equality Found. v. City of Cincinnati, 838 F.
Supp. 1235 (S.D. Ohio 1993).

FN28 When fundamental rights are denied to everyone, it raises
due process concerns. When fundamental rights are denied to some
individuals only, it raises equal protection concerns. The
applicable standard in either case, however, is strict scrutiny.

FN29 The district court found that the state alleged six
compelling state interests: (1) deterring factionalism; (2)
preserving the integrity of the state's political functions; (3)
preserving the ability of the state to remedy discrimination
against suspect classes; (4) preventing the government from
interfering with personal, familial and religious privacy; (5)
preventing the government from subsidizing the political
objectives of a special interest group; and (6) promoting the
physical and psychological well-being of children.

FN30 The district court applied the strict scrutiny standard of
review which requires the state to prove that classifications
affecting fundamental rights were necessary to promote a
compelling or overriding interest which is narrowly tailored.
See Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 217 (1982) (noting that the
classification must be "precisely tailored"); Dunn v. Blumstein,
405 U.S. 330, 342 (1972) (stating a classification involving a
fundamental right must be a compelling state interest); Shapiro
v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 634 (1969) (noting that there needed
to be a compelling reason for the government to restrict
interstate travel).

FN31 The issue of homosexuality and bisexuality is deeply
controversial and divisive. Unlike race and sex, there is no
national consensus that sexual orientation is an inappropriate
basis for governmental, much less private, decisionmaking. A
series of constitutional amendments and acts of Congress have
authoritatively settled the place of race and sex in American
life. The same simply cannot be said of non-traditional sexual
orientation.

FN32 For example, in 1989, the General Assembly passed a law
prohibiting insurance companies from inquiring about or making
coverage decisions on the basis of sexual orientation. See Sect.
103-1104(1)(f), 4A C.R.S. (1993 Supp.). In 1992, the Colorado
Civil Rights Commission went on record recommending legislation
adding sexual orientation to the list of protected classes.

FN33 Testimony of Harvard Government Professor Harvey Mansfield
indicated that the use of the initiative process to enact
Amendment 2 supported stability and respect for the political
process, by giving "the people a sense that . ..government is
not alien to them, and that they can get together by their own
initiative . ..to produce a result that gives them a sense of
satisfaction and accomplishment."

FN34 The Court in James went on to cogently state:

But of course a lawmaking procedure that "disadvantages" a
particular group does not always deny equal protection. Under
any such holding, presumably a State would not be able to
require referendums on any subject unless referendums were
required on all, because they would always disadvantage some
group. And this Court would be required to analyze governmental
structures to determine whether a gubernatorial veto provision
or a filibuster rule is likely to "disadvantage" any of the
diverse and shifting groups that make up the American people.

James v. Valtierra, 402 U.S. 137, 142 (1971).

FN35 In United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144,
152 (1938), the Supreme Court announced its standard for
reviewing legislative enactments in the economic sphere:

[T]he existence of facts supporting the legislative judgment is
to be presumed, for regulatory legislation affecting ordinary
commercial transactions is not to be pronounced unconstitutional
unless in light of the facts made known or generally assumed it
is of such a character as to preclude the assumption that it
rests upon some rational basis within the knowledge and
experience of the legislators.

FN36 Under the agreement, the Division works on a certain
number of cases involving only federally-protected classes
which, of course, does not include sexual orientation. The
Division only met the goals last year because the Equal
Employment Opportunities Commission reduced the number of cases
necessary to satisfy the agreement.

FN37 The United States Supreme Court has addressed the issue of
fiscal concerns impacting certain rights. In Plyler, 457 U.S. at
222-24, the Court held that whatever savings might be achieved
by the state by denying public education to undocumented aliens
were insubstantial compared to the costs to the children, the
state, and the nation of not educating them. In Shapiro, 394
U.S. at 618, and in Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365 (1971),
the Court found fiscal integrity not to be a compelling interest
balanced against the right to interstate travel and the right to
welfare assistance to aliens. These cases are distinguishable as
either fundamental rights cases or cases in which the object was
saving money not a basic allocation of funds.

WEBSTER LEE HUBBELL

INFORMATION

THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL CHARGES:

COUNT ONE

INTRODUCTION

1. At all times material to this Information:

        (a) The Rose Law Firm (the ``FIRM'') was a law firm
located in downtown Little Rock, Arkansas. The Firm represented
a variety of clients, including agencies of the United States
Government such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and
the Resolution Trust Corporation.

        (b) The Firm, through its attorneys, entered into
agreements with its clients setting forth the conditions and
financial arrangements for the Firm's representation. In many
instances the Firm billed clients on a monthly basis for
attorneys' fees and expenses. The amount of attorneys' fees
normally would be computed on the basis of the number of hours
of work performed on the matter by each attorney, multiplied
by the agreed hourly rate for that attorney. It was the Firm's
usual practice that a client of the Firm normally would be
obligated to pay, and would be billed, for all expenses incurred
in the course of the Firm's representation of that client, such as:
photocopies, long distance telephone calls, court reporter fees,
expert witness fees, deposition transcript fees, and case-related
travel and lodging. Expenses unrelated to the Firm's
representation of a client would not be billed to a client.

        (c) In the course of representing a client, the Firm
often incurred expenses, like those described above, that had to
be paid to vendors and other third parties in advance of the
Firm's billing the client for such expenses, or receiving payment
from the client for such expenses. Thus, the Firm maintained Firm
bank accounts--referred to as ``client advance accounts''-- to
pay the client. Any member or associate of the Firm was
authorized to obtain a ``client advance check'' to pay for
legitimate case-related expenses that were incurred in the course
of the Firm's representation of the client. If the amount of the
check exceeded $1000, two members of the Firm had to sign the
client advance check. The amount of the expenses would be paid by
the Firm, in advance, on behalf of the client; the Firm
subsequently would include a charge for such expenses on the
client's statement of services; and the client would reimburse
the Firm for the Firm's having paid the expense in advance.

        (d) On occasion, members and associates of the Firm
incurred non-case related expenses in the course of conducting
and performing business for the Firm. Such expenses included
training, business development, and other costs associated with
operating and maintaining a law practice. These general business
expenses were not billable to clients. However, when members and
associates of the Firm incurred legitimate expenses for Firm
business, the Firm would pay for these legitimate business
expenses out of a Firm account. In the event such a non-billable
expense exceeded $1000, two Firm members had to sign the
reimbursement check.

        (e) The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was an
agency of the United States Government. The Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, among other things, regulated federally
insured state chartered banks which were not members of the
Federal Reserve System, and served as a receiver for all federally
insured insolvent banks.

        (f) The Resolution Trust Corporation was an agency of the
United States Government. The Resolution Trust Corporation,
among other things, acted as a receiver for savings and loan
associations which had become financially insolvent. The
Resolution Trust Corporation was appointed receiver or conservator
for a number of such associations in Arkansas.

        (g) Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan Association
(``Madison'') was a state chartered, federally insured savings
and loan association located in Little Rock, Arkansas.

        (h) Frost & Co. was a certified public accounting firm
doing business in Arkansas.

        (i) The Firm represented the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation between May 1994 and December 1992 and the
Resolution Trust Corporation between November 1990 and November
1994 and, pursuant to a fee agreement, billed the Federal
Deposit Insurance
Corporation and the Resolution Trust Corporation for attorneys'
fees and expenses.

        (j) From May 1973 through January 1993, defendant WEBSTER
LEE HUBBELL was a practicing attorney who was a member of the
Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas. As a member of the Firm,
he acted as the billing attorney on many legal matters handled
for clients, and accordingly, had responsibility for sending
statements of services to these clients for the legal work
rendered by the Firm on their behalf and any costs associated
with such work. In January 1993, defendant WEBSTER LEE HUBBELL
resigned from the Firm and became Associate Attorney General of
the United States. He held this position until March 14, 1994 when
he resigned.


        2. From in or about January 1989, and continuing to in or
about March 1994, in the Eastern District of Arkansas, and
elsewhere, WEBSTER LEE HUBBELL, defendant herein, devised, intended
to devise and knowingly participated in a scheme to defraud and to
obtain money and property from the Rose Law Firm and its members,
and from the Firm's clients, including the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation and the Resolution Trust Corporation, by means of
false and fraudulent pretenses and representations, well knowing
that the pretenses and representations would be and were false
and fraudulent when made, which scheme is further described in the
following paragraphs.

        3. In was part of the scheme that defendant WEBSTER LEE
HUBBELL fraudulently obtained funds from the Firm's bank
accounts in the form of client advance checks and other
instruments to pay for personal expenses and purchases. To
obtain these funds, defendant WEBSTER LEE HUBBELL fraudulently
created, submitted and signed documents falsely purporting to
represent legitimate Firm and client billable expenses, when in fact
the expenses were not properly billable to clients nor reimbursable
by the Firm. By operation of his scheme, defendant WEBSTER LEE
HUBBELL fraudulently obtained at least $394,000.00 through the
payment of personal expenses with Firm checks.

        4. It was a further part of the scheme that defendant
WEBSTER LEE HUBBELL indicated on copies of the checks or notes
attached thereto that a particular client advance check be
charged to a specific client of the Firm. Defendant WEBSTER LEE
HUBBELL willfully concealed that the client advance checks were
for personal expenses, and instead falsely represented on the
internal paperwork of the Firm that he was using the checks to
pay for legitimate business expenses or case-related expenses
associated with the representation of a particular client.

        5. It was further part of the scheme that, in order to
further conceal that he was paying for personal expenses with
Firm checks, and that certain of the expenses would be billed to
clients on statements of services, defendant WEBSTER LEE HUBBELL
altered various internal billing memoranda through several means,
including:


        (a) indicating that the amount on the client-advance
check was for a fictitious business expense;

        (b) causing the alleged ``business expense'' to be billed
to a client, even though the client was not responsible for that
expense, because it was not incurred on behalf of the client;

        (c) mischaracterizing the expense as something other than
that for which payment actually was made;

        (d) inflating the number of hours of attorney time for
which a client was billed, above the actual hours worked, in
order to obtain legal fees beyond those to which the Firm and
defendant WEBSTER LEE HUBBELL were entitled; and

        (e) ``writing off' or deleting certain of his personal
expenses from final client statements of services thereby
causing the Firm and its members to pay for such personal
expenses.

        6. It was further part of the scheme that defendant
WEBSTER LEE HUBBELL knowingly deprived certain clients of
property, that is money, by causing them to pay for certain of
his personal expenses.

        7. It was further part of the scheme to defraud that
defendant WEBSTER LEE HUBBELL would cause billing statements
which contained misrepresentations and false information to be
sent to the following clients: the Resolution Trust Corporation,
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Flintkote,
Environmental Systems Company, Money Mortgage Inc., Champion
Enterprises, American Cemetery Associates, Air Products, Universal
Underwriters, Worthen Bank, American Council of Life Insurance,
Tyson Foods Inc., Lovett & Foster Ltd., Sturgis Estate, Brickel
Financial Services and Central Texas Iron Works.

        8. Further defendant WEBSTER LEE HUBBELL knowingly
deprived the Firm and its members of property, that is money, by
causing them to pay for certain of his personal expenses and
defrauded the Firm of its right to defendant's honest services.

        9. It was a further part of the scheme that defendant
WEBSTER LEE HUBBELL would cause client advance checks drawn on
the Firm to be sent in payment of his and his family's personal
expenses for credit card purchases billed to the following credit
cards: American Express Centurion Bank, Associates National Bank
Execugold Visa, American Express Optima, MBNA Master Card,
Associates National Bank Amoco Master Card, Primerica Visa,
Associates National Bank Execugold Master Card, Primerica Master
Card, First USA Visa, and American Express Gold Card; and that
defendant would fraudulently represent to the Firm that all
these payments were legitimate client case-related expenses, or
legitimate non-case-related business expenses.

        10. It was further part of the scheme that defendant
WEBSTER LEE HUBBELL, between May 1994 and March 1994, made
repeated verbal misrepresentations to members of the Firm that
he would provide documentation to prove that the questioned
expenses were billed legitimately to the clients or passed on
to the Firm.

EXECUTION OF FRAUD


        11. It was further part of the scheme that on or about
March 7, 1990, at the direction of defendant WEBSTER LEE
HUBBELL, the Firm prepared a statement of services to be sent to
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for the Firm's
representation of the Government's suit against Frost & Co., a
local accounting firm, in connection with Frost & Co.'s allegedly
negligent auditing of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan. defendant
WEBSTER LEE HUBBELL fraudulently caused the statement of services to
reflect charges for personal expenses that were misrepresented as
charges for legitimate business expenses.

        12. On or about March 7, 1990, at Little Rock, Arkansas,
in the Eastern District of Arkansas, and elsewhere, defendant
WEBSTER LEE HUBBELL defendant herein, for the purpose of executing
the above-described scheme to defraud and to obtain money and
property by means of false and fraudulent pretenses,
representations and promises, and attempting to do so, knowingly
and willfully did cause to be placed in an authorized depository
for mail matter, to be sent and delivered by the United States
Postal Service, according to the directions thereon, an envelope
containing a statement of services to the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation.

        In violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 2
and 1341.

COUNT TWO


        On or about October 15, 1993, in the Eastern District of
Arkansas, defendant WEBSTER LEE HUBBELL, defendant herein, a
resident of Little Rock, Arkansas, who during the calendar year
1992 was married, did willfully and knowingly attempt to evade
and defeat a substantial part of the income tax due and owing
by him to the United States of America for the calendar year
1992, by filing and causing to be filed with the Director,
Internal Revenue Service Center, a false and fraudulent United
States Individual Income Tax Return, Form 1040, wherein he
stated that his total income for the calendar year 1992,
including his income from the Rose Law Firm, was $194,966, and
he stated that his taxable income for the calendar year 1992 was
the sum of $122,074, and that the amount of tax due and owing
thereon was the sum of $32,193, whereas, as he then and there well
knew and believed, his total income for the calendar year 1992,
including his income from the Rose Law Firm, was at least
$309,168, and his taxable income for the said calendar year was
the sum of at least $249,990, upon which said taxable income
there was due and owing to the United States of America an income
tax of $71,358.

        In violation of Title 26, United States Code, Section
7201.

KENNETH W. STARR
Independent Counsel







IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
EASTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS
WESTERN DIVISION

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

v.

WEBSTER LEE HUBBELL

NO. LR-CR-94-241

PLEA AGREEMENT


        This Plea Agreement between the Independent Counsel,
KENNETH W. STARR, and the defendant WEBSTER LEE HUBBELL, and his
attorney, John W. Nields, Jr., is made pursuant to Rule 11(e)(B)
of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

        This Plea Agreement is entirely voluntary and represents
the entire agreement between the Independent Counsel and the
Defendant regarding Defendant's criminal liability in case No.
LR-CR94-241.

        This Plea Agreement finally resolves all of Defendant's
criminal liability involving his billing and expense practices
while a member of the Rose Law Firm as set forth in the
Information, and nothing herein shall limit or in any way waive
or release any administrative or judicial civil claim, demand or
cause of action, whatsoever, of the United States or its agencies
relating to the conduct of the Defendant set forth in the
Information in this case. Moreover, this Agreement is limited to
the Independent Counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, and cannot bind other
federal, state, or local prosecuting, administrative, or
regulatory authorities except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement.

        By this Plea Agreement, KENNETH W. STARR, Independent
Counsel, and the Defendant, WEBSTER LEE HUBBELL, and his
attorney, John W. Nields, Jr., agree upon the following:

        1. Defendant WEBSTER LEE HUBBELL agrees to waive in open
court prosecution by Indictment and consents that the proceeding
may be by Information instead of by Indictment.

        Defendant acknowledges that he has been charged in the
Information in this case with Mail Fraud, in violation of Title
18, United States Code, Section 1341, and with Tax Evasion, in
violation of Title 26, United States Code, section 7201.

        2. Defendant has read the charges against him contained in
the Information and those charges have been fully explained to him
by his attorney.

        3. Defendant fully understands the nature and elements of
the crimes with which he has been charged.

        4. Defendant will enter voluntary pleas of guilty to
Counts One and Two of the Information in this case.

        5. Defendant will plead guilty because he is in fact
guilty of the charges contained in Counts One and Two of the
Information. In pleading guilty, defendant admits that he did,
in fact, devise a scheme to defraud as described in Count One of
the Information. Defendant admits that he did in fact, attempt to
evade and defeat his income tax as set forth in Count Two of the
Information.

        6. For purposes of applying the Guidelines promulgated by
the United States Sentencing Commission pursuant to Title 28,
United States Code, Section 994, the parties agree on the
propositions set forth in Paragraphs 7 through 11 below.

        7. (a) Pursuant to Sentencing Guideline 2F1.1(a) and
2F1.1(b)(1), and the fact that the amount of the fraud committed
by the Defendant between 1989 and 1992, as charged in Count One
of the Information, is at least $394,000.00, the base offense
level for the offense set forth in Count One is at least level 15.
The parties agree to present their final calculations as to the
exact dollar amount of the fraud prior to sentencing.

        (b) Pursuant to Sentencing Guideline 2F1.1(b)(2), and the
fact that the offense charged in Count One of the Information
involved (A) more than minimal planning, and (B) a scheme to
defraud more than one victim, an upward increase of 2 levels
is appropriate.

        (c) Pursuant to Sentencing Guideline 3B1.3, and the fact
that the Defendant abused a position of trust, and used a
special skill (he being a lawyer) in a manner that significantly
facilitated the commission and concealment of the offense, as
set forth in Count One of the Information, an additional upward
increase of 2 levels is appropriate.

        8. (a) Pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines 2T1.1(a) and
2T4.1, and the fact that the Defendant's unreported income for
the years 1989 through 1992 is at least $394,000.00, and the tax
loss pertaining to all of Defendant's relevant criminal
conduct in violation of the tax laws (for the years 1989 through
1992)
is more than $120,000.00, the base offense level for the tax
offense set forth in Count Two is level 15.

        (b) Pursuant to Sentencing Guideline 2T1.3(b)(1), and the
fact that the Defendant failed to report income exceeding
$10,000.00 from criminal activity in 1992, the base offense
level for the offense set forth in Count Two is to receive an
upward adjustment of 2 levels.

        9. Defendant has demonstrated a recognition of
affirmative acceptance of personal responsibility for his
criminal conduct. If the Independent Counsel does not receive
additional evidence in conflict with this provision, and if the
Defendant continues to accept full responsibility for his actions,
within the meaning of Sentencing Guideline 3E1.1, a three-level
reduction in the offense level is appropriate.

        10. Based on the facts known to the government as of the
date of this Agreement and stipulated in subparagraphs above,
the Defendant's criminal history points equal 0 and the
Defendant's criminal history category is 1; and

        11. Defendant and his attorney and the Independent
Counsel acknowledge that the above calculations are preliminary
in nature and based on facts known to the government as of the
time of this Agreement. In the case of the amount listed in
subparagraphs 7 and 8 above, the figure indicated is a minimum
figure, and is not intended to be a final calculation. The
Defendant understands that the Probation Office will conduct its
own investigation and that the Court ultimately determines the
facts and law relevant to sentencing, and that the Court's
determinations govern the final Sentencing Guidelines calculation.
Accordingly, the validity of this Agreement is not contingent upon
the Probation Office's or the Court's concurrence with the above
calculations.

        12. Errors in calculations or interpretation of any of
the guidelines may be corrected or amended by either party prior
to sentencing. The parties may correct these errors or
misinterpretations either by stipulation or by a statement to
the Probation Office and/or Court setting forth the disagreement as
to the correct guidelines and their application. The validity of this
Agreement will not be affected by such corrections or amendments,
and the Defendant shall not have a right to withdraw his plea on the
basis of such corrections or amendments.

        13. Defendant understands that Count One of the
Information to which he will plead guilty carries a maximum
penalty of five years imprisonment; a maximum fine of
$250,000.00 [18 USC 3571(b)(3)]; or an alternative fine based on
gain or loss [18 USC 3571(d)]; and any restitution ordered by the
Court.

        14. Defendant understands that Count Two of the
Information to which he will plead guilty carries a maximum
penalty of five years imprisonment, a maximum fine of
$250,000.00 [18 USC 3571(b)(3)], together with the costs of the
prosecution, and any restitution ordered by the Court.

        15. Defendant understands that in accordance with the
federal law, Title 18, United States Code, Section 3013, upon
entry of judgment of conviction, the Defendant will be assessed
$50.00 on each count to which he has pled guilty, in addition
to any other penalty imposed.

        16. Defendant agrees to cooperate by providing full,
complete, accurate and truthful information concerning matters
under investigation by the Office of the Independent Counsel.
If, in the judgment of the Independent Counsel, the Defendant
has provided substantial assistance in an investigation or
prosecution, within the meaning of Section 5K1.1 of the Sentencing
Guidelines, the Independent Counsel will move pursuant to
Section 5K1.1 for a downward departure.

        Defendant has the right to seek a downward departure on
grounds other than that set forth in paragraph 16 above, and the
Independent Counsel is free to take whatever position it deems
appropriate with respect thereto.

        17. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the Internal
Revenue Service in its collection of any taxes, interest or
penalties from the Defendant.

        18. Defendant agrees to fill accurate amended income tax
returns, Form 1040X, with the Internal Revenue Service for the
calendar years 1989 through 1992.

        19. Defendant understands that the Independent Counsel
will fully apprise the District Court and the United States
Probation Office of the nature, scope and extent of Defendant's
conduct regarding the charges against him, and related conduct
relevant to and including all matters in aggravation or mitigation
on the issue of sentencing.

        20. It is understood by the parties that the sentencing
Judge is neither a party to nor bound by this Agreement and is
free to impose the maximum penalties as set forth in paragraphs
13 and 14 above.

        21. The Independent Counsel agrees that the Defendant
should be released on his own recognizance pending sentence.

        22. Defendant may request designation to a particular
facility, and the Independent Counsel agrees to take no position
with respect to such designation.

        23. The Independent Counsel agrees that the Defendant
should be permitted to self-surrender to the facility to which
he is designated.

        24. Should the Judge refuse to accept the Defendant's
plea of guilty to Counts One and Two of the Information, this
Agreement shall become null and void and neither party will be
bound thereto.

        25. Defendant acknowledges that he has read this
Agreement and carefully reviewed each provision with his
attorney. Defendant further acknowledges that he understands and
voluntarily accepts each and every term and condition of this
Agreement.

<H3>THE TWO SIDES OF ORRIN HATCH<BR>
Strident Conservative or Thoughtful Moderate:<BR>
Which One Will Lead Senate Judiciary?</H3>

<H4>By Naftali Bendavid<BR>
Legal Times</H4>

<P>As the Senate clerk began the slow roll-call vote at 2:20 Thursday afternoon, Orrin Hatch thought he still had a minuscule chance to pull out a win on the balanced-budget amendment.</P>

<P>Sen. Mark Hatfield, the lone Republican opposing the amendment, might yet come around, Hatch thought, providing him the margin of victory. Just two hours earlier, Hatch and Sen. Paul Simon (D- Ill.) sat alone in the darkened Senate chamber, wondering if there was any way to swing Hatfield, and came up empty. But Hatch continued to hope.</P>

<P>Then the clerk called out "Mr. Hatfield." The Oregon senator responded "No" in a quiet, firm voice, and Hatch knew it was all over. He turned to staffers lined up against the back wall of the Senate chamber and shook their hands.</P>

<P>As he emerged into the elaborately tiled Capitol hallway, aide Sharon Prost startled the disconsolate Hatch with a hug. "Congratulations, boss," she said.</P>

<P>Others agreed. Sen. Larry Craig (R-Idaho) leaned through a cluster of reporters to shake Hatch's hand, saying, "You did a great job." Despite falling one vote short of the two-thirds majority needed, the countless hours of cajoling and speechifying only seemed to have increased Hatch's stature within GOP ranks.</P>

<P>Borrowing Vice President Albert Gore Jr.'s ornate Capitol office for an interview, the 6-foot-2, rod-thin Hatch looked uncharacteristically weary after 116 hours of floor debate.</P>

<P>"I've been through defeats before," he said resolutely. Then he confessed, "I'm absolutely exhausted." And, lowering his senatorial guard for a brief, plaintive moment, he added, "I just want to win."</P>

<P>The relentlessness that almost won Hatch a momentous victory last week has been a trademark during his 18-year Senate career. But it is all the more important now, because Hatch is suddenly a very powerful man.</P>

<P>In January, Hatch became chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. And no one really knows what to expect.</P>

<P>Hatch's career, after all, has generated some grisly moments: Orrin Hatch calling the Democrats "the party of homosexuals" in a 1988 speech. Orrin Hatch in 1990 comparing Oliver North to Jesus Christ. Orrin Hatch waving a copy of The Exorcist in 1991 as he accuses Anita Hill of fabricating sexual harassment claims. Orrin Hatch, in the tone of a Sunday school teacher, killing a civil-rights bill or helping to smother the Equal Rights Amendment.</P>

<P>But there's another Hatch, too. No one dismisses him any longer as just a scorched-earth ideologue like Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.). He helped push through a generous child-care bill in 1989, leading fellow conservatives to equate him with Karl Marx and Benedict Arnold. In 1990, he single-handedly saved a law forbidding discrimination against AIDS patients. An unusually considerate man, Hatch has forged a friendship with his political opposite, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), that has become legendary; Kennedy scrawled on a painting he gave Hatch in 1991, "We'll leave the light at the [Kennedy] compound on for you anytime."</P>

<P>A former trial lawyer now plying his advocacy skills in the Senate, Hatch, 60, has been mentioned as a potential Supreme Court justice in the past and doubtless will be mentioned again should President Clinton be ousted by a Republican in 1996. But in a sense, the Constitution is already on Hatch's desk. House Speaker Newt Gingrich is on a crusade to resurrect school prayer, weaken defendants' rights, limit politicians' terms, require a balanced budget. President Clinton is trying desperately to rebuff the onslaught. In many cases, the senator from Utah could tip the balance.</P>

<P>The question is: Which Orrin Hatch will it be?</P>

<P><B>Doing the Right Thing<B>
In a series of interviews in his elegant, slightly cluttered Senate office, Hatch struggles to describe himself, clearly uncomfortable with the attempt. His voice is low and controlled, as though to avoid expending any more energy than absolutely necessary.</P>

<P>"I'm motivated intensely to do what's right," Hatch says. "I really try hard. Sometimes, looking back on it, I didn't do what was right. Take Martin Luther King's holiday. I voted against that solely on the basis that I felt we didn't need another holiday. . . . And I was wrong. I was wrong. I didn't take into consideration how very important it was to a large segment of our population. If I had one vote I would cast again, it's that one."</P>

<P>The struggle embodied in that admission reflects a duality that has characterized Hatch's political life. In recent years, he has gained an increasing reputation for thoughtfulness, even moderation. But that only heightens the contrast with the harshness and stridency that have at times punctuated his career.</P>

<P>Spy magazine named Hatch to its list of the "100 Worst People and Events of 1992," tied for second with Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.) -- because, the magazine said, Hatch is an "evil GOP creep." In 1985, Eleanor Smeal, then president of the National Organization for Women, called Hatch a "fascist." In the early 1980s, Hatch's name was used in fund-raising letters -- by liberals counting on anti-Hatch sentiment.</P>

<P>There is something about Hatch that drives his opponents wild. "It's almost an aesthetic thing: He's prissy. He's too neat. He looks too much like a goody-two-shoes," says Eric Sterling, president of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation, a generally liberal think tank. "If you wear cords or jeans and you have a beard, and maybe you're three weeks overdue for a haircut, you look at Orrin Hatch and say, 'Who's he trying to impress? He looks like the guy on top of the wedding cake.' "</P>

<P>Hatch, to be sure, has given liberal adversaries reason to resent him. From the day he walked through the Capitol doors in January 1977, having never before held political office, Hatch has combined an in-your-face sharpness in debate with a relentless legislative skill.</P>

<P>In a May 1978 battle that would set the tone for his career, Hatch commanded a tightly organized filibuster against a bill that would have given unions numerous new organizing tools. A little-known rookie senator, Hatch shocked the Senate's old hands with his instinctive strategic abilities.</P>

<P>Hatch focused on seven swing Democrats, he recalls, carefully tailoring his tactics to suit each senator. With Sen. Edward Zorinsky of Nebraska, for example, Hatch agreed, in return for Zorinsky's vote, to tell Zorinsky if the fight became hopeless, so Zorinsky could switch his vote and avoid the labor movement's wrath. As for John Sparkman of Alabama -- who, Hatch says, was elderly and vulnerable to persuasion -- Hatch assigned a senator to rush to Sparkman's side whenever a Democratic leader approached him.</P>

<P>Hatch worked 18 hours a day. He introduced roughly 1,200 amendments. In the end, he managed to torpedo legislation wanted badly by the entire labor movement, the Senate's Democratic leadership, and most of Hatch's colleagues.</P>

<P>"They weren't used to having Republicans stand up, especially some young senator from Utah," Hatch says of his colleagues. "But I'm not apologizing for it, because I believed in what I was doing."</P>

<P>In 1978, Hatch also began waging a furious battle against the popular Equal Rights Amendment. "I believe in equal rights for women," Hatch explains. "[But] we have over 20 laws that guarantee them. I would prefer to work with those 20 laws than write a 53-word definition into the Constitution that could be vastly misconstrued."</P>

<P><B>A Question of Style</B><BR>
Just a few years into his first term, Hatch was earning a reputation as a rigid right-winger, like Helms, only smarter and more dangerous. In 1982, he fought attempts to extend and strengthen the Voting Rights Act, a bill originally inspired by Martin Luther King Jr., and other civil-rights leaders. He thwarted for four years the "Grove City" bill --popular even with some Republicans -- which bans discrimination in colleges and other institutions receiving federal funds. Displaying a mastery of Senate rules, Hatch introduced some 1,000 amendments to that bill.</P>

<P>Hatch argues that affirmative action is merely discrimination in another form. "I want civil rights bills to be written right," he says. "I don't want them to be written where one group is pitted against another."</P>

<P>But to some, Hatch was an enemy, albeit a skilled one, who seemed to be everywhere at once. "Hatch is always there, even when it's above and beyond the call of duty," says Nan Aron, executive director of the Washington, D.C. -- based Alliance for Justice, which fights to put liberal judges on the bench. "Hatch is smart. He goes for the jugular. He knows exactly where to draw the knife and how to put it in."</P>

<P>It has often been Hatch's style, as much as his views, that upsets his adversaries. "Part of it is self-righteousness: 'I'm moral and [anyone] who disagrees with me isn't,' " says Elliot Mincberg, legal director of the liberal People for the American Way. "And part of it is that when he says things that aren't true, you're pretty sure he knows better. It's almost Orwellian, in that he'll insist that war is peace and lies are truth, and it's as though if you say it loudly enough and self -righteously enough, then it's true. That's infuriating."</P>

<P>Hatch concedes that some consider him harsh. But he attributes that to his first big fight, over the labor bill. "Because I had to take a very strong position, I got branded by some -- only by some -- as strident," Hatch says. "And I think some of that was deserved. Part of it was youthful excess and lack of knowledge. Part of it was lack of experience. Part of it was not knowing my colleagues as well as I should. All of which I've tried to overcome."</P>

<P>But it was not just the battle over the labor bill that earned Hatch some unflattering labels from liberals. At an October 1982 campaign debate at Brigham Young University, Hatch's Democratic opponent Ted Wilson recalls, Hatch equated opposition to Reaganomics with "socialism." When the crowd groaned -- even at conservative BYU that was considered a low blow -- Hatch glibly retorted, "Sorry if I've offended some Democrats."</P>

<P>In an August 1988 speech at a Utah Republican fund-raiser, Hatch, according to the Los Angeles Times, said Democrats "are the party of homosexuals. They are the party of abortion. They are the party that has fought school prayer every step of the way. They are the party that has basically, I think, denigrated a lot of the values that have made this country the greatest country in the world."</P>

<P>As recently as last summer's congressional debate over the 1994 crime bill, Hatch lambasted those opposing harsh mandatory sentences for drug dealers who sell to minors.</P>

<P>"I will never understand the liberal mind," Hatch declared on the Senate floor. "Why are they not more concerned about these kids?" (Hatch himself, in an article in the Wake Forest Law Review a year earlier, had acknowledged that there are numerous problems with mandatory sentences, and that they are often applied in an unfair way.)</P>

<P>None of this would matter much if Hatch were not so effective. Jesse Helms' statements may be more outrageous, but liberals find it easy to portray him as a buffoon, with his heavy jowls and antebellum oratory. Helms often seems happy to go down in flames for some arch-conservative principle. Not Hatch; he wants to win. And that makes him far more dangerous to the left.</P>

<P>"Once you determine that he will be your opponent, you'd better damn well be ready for a bloody battle," says Laura Murphy Lee, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's D.C. office. "He's dedicated, and he's focused, and he's thorough."</P>

<P>Wilson, the former Democratic Salt Lake City mayor who unsuccessfully challenged Hatch in 1982, recalls Hatch's dogged determination all too well. After a long day of campaigning in the tiny Utah town of Midway, Wilson relaxed at a home he owned nearby. He was surprised to get a call from Hatch who began telling him, "I really need your vote." Mystified at first, Wilson suddenly realized Hatch was merely calling local residents at random, and was not aware that he was speaking to his election opponent.</P>

<P>Wilson identified himself, and the two laughed. "But then I thought, 'I'm here putting my feet up, and he's on the phone. He's working harder than I am,' " Wilson recalls.</P>

<P>Hatch is notoriously persuasive when he takes a colleague aside for a sales job. "He just keeps coming," Sen. Simpson says. "He will drive you crazy. You'll tell him no, and he'll say, 'Come on now, you just go home to bed and think about how you've got to do this for your friend Orrin.' "</P>

<P>And Hatch can be blunt. "He very often will just get on the phone and say, 'This is Orrin. We've got a hearing this afternoon. How are you thinking of voting?' " recounts Randall Rader, a former Hatch aide and now a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</P>

<P><B>The Scrapper</B><BR>
Nothing brings out Hatch's aggressiveness like fights over judicial nominees. One of the great Republican crusades of the 1980s was a campaign to elevate shock troops of young conservatives to the federal bench. Liberals fought back, and the Senate Judiciary Committee became an arena for impassioned struggles over the nation's direction.</P>

<P>Hatch conducted hand-to-hand combat in the smallest of fights. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan nominated Joseph Rodriguez, a New Jersey public defender and a Democrat, to the New Jersey federal District Court. Hatch, along with Republican Sens. Jeremiah Denton of Alabama and John East of North Carolina, asked Rodriguez to fill out a special questionnaire that featured such loaded questions as "Do you believe that a 'viable' fetus is a human being?" Widely seen as bullying, the questionnaire provoked an outcry; the senators backed off, and Rodriguez was confirmed.</P>

<P>That skirmish, though, turned out to be merely a warm-up. In 1986 President Reagan nominated then Associate Justice William Rehnquist to be chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. The fight was instantly nasty, each side accusing the other of trying to shove its agenda down America's throat. Hatch was the Republicans' general, grilling witnesses, attacking liberals' motives, even inventing a term --"the Rehnquisition" -- to describe opponents' tactics.</P>

<P>Summing up on the Senate floor, Hatch thundered, "The inquisitors have searched in vain for any inconsistency, crack, or break that they might use to justify their foreordained verdict -- guilty, guilty, guilty."</P>

<P>With Hatch's help, Rehnquist was confirmed. Liberals were determined to do better when Robert Bork was nominated in 1987. They organized quickly, taking out full-page ads charging that Bork would dismantle civil rights, demolish a woman's right to abortion, and generally resurrect the social attitudes of the last century. Public sentiment veered against the judge.</P>

<P>Hatch fought back tenaciously. He had his staff circle and underline "flaws" in each anti-Bork ad. Throughout the hearings, Hatch periodically held up an ad, loudly voicing disgust at its errors. Hatch aide Rader, who helped find the "flaws," acknowledges that some of them were more substantive than others, but says there was pressure to find ever-greater numbers of mistakes.</P>

<P>The liberal groups so feared Hatch that they made an uncharacteristic decision not to appear before the Judiciary Committee. "Because of Senator Hatch's ability to dismantle the credibility and integrity of groups and make his opponents the issue, I suggested that groups not testify," says Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. "I think that was one of the most strategically important decisions contributing to the defeat of Robert Bork."</P>

<P>After Bork's ultimate rejection, Hatch was all the more determined to ensure the confirmation of Clarence Thomas in 1991. So when University of Oklahoma law Professor Anita Hill exploded on the scene with allegations that Thomas had sexually harassed her, Hatch and other Republicans struck back hard.</P>

<P>During Thomas's electrifying confirmation hearings, Hatch painstakingly took Thomas through each of Hill's allegations -- that Thomas had made lewd comments about a pubic hair on a Coca-Cola can, for example. But nothing approached the climactic moment when Hatch brandished a copy of William Blatty's novel, The Exorcist, and triumphantly quoted a passage in which a character refers to "an alien pubic hair floating around in my gin."</P>

<P>Hatch was convinced he had proved that Hill had fabricated her accusations. Hill's defenders were convinced Hatch was persecuting her. And much of the country was simply nauseated by the specter of a senator waving a copy of The Exorcist in defense of a Supreme Court nominee. "It was sleazy and slimy," asserts Rutgers University law Professor Frank Askin, a liberal judicial selection expert. "He made up things out of whole cloth to try to impugn her character."</P>

<P>Hatch defends his histrionics. "I said, 'There's something wrong here,' " Hatch says. "Did I like Anita Hill? Yes. Did I think she was a wonderful witness? Yes. Do I wish her well? You bet. But I believe Clarence Thomas."</P>

<P><B>Long Way from Pittsburgh</B><BR>
The anteroom to Hatch's office bristles with mementos: A photo of Steve Young, quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, who, like Hatch, attended Brigham Young University. A medallion awarded by former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. A political cartoon showing Ted Kennedy saying, "Remember, Orrin, we liberals are for the poor -- and we intend to keep them that way!"</P>

<P>In the office itself, six paintings are clustered on the wall, mostly landscapes by his favorite Utah painter, Veloy Eaton. Jewish paraphernalia -- skullcap, menorah, shofar -- are arrayed on a table behind his desk, testimony to Hatch's fascination with religion. (Hatch is a devout Mormon.)</P>

<P>This is a long way from Pittsburgh, where Hatch grew up dirt poor. His childhood home was built by his father out of used lumber, he recalls, and his first residence after he married his wife, Elaine, was a former chicken coop behind his parents' home.</P>

<P>Hatch's father trained him to be a lather, a metalwork construction tradesman, and he started at age 16. Years later, shortly after arriving in the Senate, Hatch remembers, he had a run-in with Robert Georgine, president of the AFL-CIO Building and Construction Trades Department. Hatch was considered virulently anti-union, and Georgine told him at a hearing, "The problem with you, Senator Hatch, is you don't know what it's like to work with your hands."</P>

<P>Hatch recounts, "And I leaned over and said, 'Bobby, do you realize I was a member of the Wood, Wire and Metal Lathers Union while you were president of the union?' I said, 'I could tie more lath with one arm tied behind my back than you could with both hands on your best day.' " Hatch guffaws. "I'm not sure he's ever liked me since."</P>

<P>Some speculate that Hatch's poor childhood is responsible for his tireless drive. "Orrin has crossed the economic and cultural spectrum of the United States," says Kevin McGuiness, a former Hatch aide and now a partner at D.C.'s McGuiness & Holch. "David Letterman sometimes says he's afraid someone will tap him on the shoulder and say, 'We didn't know you were here. Now go back to Indiana.' I think there's a little bit of that in Hatch."</P>

<P>Hatch, who has six children, attended Brigham Young University and the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, moving to Salt Lake City in 1969. He practiced various kinds of law, from defending alleged tax cheats to suing railroads on behalf on injured workers. Hatch spent 14 years developing the tactics he now uses daily in the Senate: endless preparation, aggressive attack on all fronts, timely use of devastating quips, direct assaults on his opponents' motives.</P>

<P>Walter Plumb III, Hatch's partner from 1974 to 1976, remembers visiting the courthouse to watch Hatch argue a federal tax-fraud case. "It was incredible," says Plumb, who still practices law in Salt Lake City. "Orrin dominated everything. Three women on the jury had tears running down their face. And he was defending a guy who hadn't filed his tax returns in five years!"</P>

<P>Hatch won five tax-fraud cases in a row, Plumb recalls: "It got to the point where I'd call the IRS and say, 'Send your best team from Washington. We're going to kick your butt.' "</P>

<P>Hatch says his courtroom experience has served him well, although he acknowledges such tactics can be overdone. "Sometimes, if you get too fierce and you get too combative, it can be a detriment to you," Hatch explains. "So you have to be careful that the skills that you've refined in courts of law and arguments of law don't become the sole arena for all you do. You have to temper those things with a respect for other people."</P>

<P><B>Missionary Zeal</B><BR>
While an impoverished childhood and a career as an aggressive lawyer have shaped Hatch, nothing has been as important as religion. The two cities where Orrin Hatch works, Washington and Salt Lake City, are both defined by powerful institutions -- one by government, the other by church. As Washington radiates outward from the Capitol, so Salt Lake City is centered on the Mormon Temple. Both cities number their streets based on their distance from the source of power; both are defined by their central shrine. Hatch moves easily between the two cities.</P>

<P>It is a cottage industry among Hatch-watchers to try to figure out just how his Mormonism affects him as a politician. Hatch is clearly a deeply religious man, yet he rarely mentions his faith in public.</P>

<P>"I'm not fanatic about it," Hatch says. "But each senator's total makeup comes from a complex variety of experience, and religion is one of the more profound and worthwhile of those sets of experiences."</P>

<P>Mormons believe that a small band of Israelites left the Middle East 600 years before the birth of Jesus and became the true heirs to the Christian church. Mormon doctrine -- with its belief that Jesus visited this continent and that some Native Americans are descendants of Israelites --  is a striking mix of Americanism and Christianity.</P>

<P>"Mormonism is a fascinating religion," says McGuiness, the former Hatch aide and a non-Mormon. "It's very specific. Unlike most religions, which are at times murky, if you have a question, they have an answer. I think that would bring you a confidence and [assurance] you wouldn't otherwise have."</P>

<P>Hatch's religious fervor showed up early, his mother, Helen, recalls: "He could stand up and recite Scriptures at a young age. He sang from three-years-old on -- country songs, church songs. 'The Old Rugged Cross' -- he sang that over and over. He memorized it."</P>

<P>Like other Mormons, Hatch served on a two-year mission after high school. His older brother Jess had died in World War II, and Hatch was determined to fill two missions, one for himself and one for his brother.</P>

<P>It is easy to see a missionary's zeal and moralism in some of Hatch's Senate speeches. And his Mormon beliefs -- with their emphasis on thrift, family, traditionalism -- mesh tightly with today's conservative movement. "It's deeper than politics; it's part of the culture," says Wilson, the former Salt Lake City mayor. "Mormons don't vote conservative because of specific issues. Conservatism is closer to the church, or closer to God."</P>

<P>Mormonism in Utah has become so entwined with Republicanism, says Wilson, a rare Mormon Democrat, that once when he was in church, someone joked, "What are you doing here? I thought you were a Democrat."</P>

<P>Hatch embodies this culture perfectly; he won a fourth term last November with 69 percent of the vote. Says Wilson, who now heads the Hinckley Institute of Politics at the University of Utah: "Hatch doesn't run around posing as Mr. Mormon, but he's been skilled at keeping a close-knit relationship with the church."</P>

<P><B>Personal-Freedom Fighter</B><BR>
It is not unusual for politicians to make purist speeches one day and gritty compromises the next. But Hatch's duality is on an entirely different level. Sometimes his sharpness and tactics approach those of heavy-handed Newt Gingrich. At other times, his eloquence in defense of AIDS patients and his courage on behalf of single mothers are positively moving.</P>

<P>Some compare Hatch to Jack Kemp, suggesting he fits with a new breed of conservatives who meld fiscal toughness with occasional social softness. But in truth the national political scene holds no one else like him.</P>

<P>To begin with, some liberals say he is more approachable than other hard-line conservatives. "He can be very thoughtful," says the ACLU's Lee. "At least you have a chance with him. With some members you don't even dare request an appointment."</P>

<P>Anthony Podesta, then president of People for the American Way, signed a fund-raising letter in the early 1980s featuring Sens. Hatch, Helms, and East as a sinister trinity. "It was about the heathens at the gate," Podesta says. "It was about how they were about to start running your life and invading your home and personal life."</P>

<P>Hatch anguished over the letter; he invited Podesta to his office and made the case that he is not an irredeemable opponent of civil liberties. Podesta, persuaded, dropped Hatch from the broadside. "We've managed to work together since then," says Podesta, who now runs Podesta Associates, a D.C. lobbying firm. "Helms and East were proud to be in our fund-raising letter. Hatch is a man of intelligence and integrity and was offended by what we said about him."</P>

<P>One of Hatch's more notable forays over partisan lines was in 1989, when he took on virtually the entire Republican Party in co- sponsoring a major child-care bill with Sen. Christopher Dodd (D- Conn.). The backlash was fierce. "I have been personally likened to Karl Marx, Benedict Arnold, and even Brutus," Hatch complained on the Senate floor just before the bill passed.</P>

<P>The most recent example of Hatch's standing up for a cause precious to liberals is his rescue of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. To be sure, many conservative groups, including the Mormon Church, supported the bill. But when the legislation came under attack, it was from the right, and Hatch's response was critical.</P>

<P>The bill, overturning a recent Supreme Court decision, forbade the enforcement of state laws that interfere with religious practices unless the state has a compelling interest. But anti-abortion activists protested that it would allow women to claim a religious right to abortion. State attorneys general feared that prison inmates would demand steak-and-champagne dinners because some invented religion required it. Support grew for a series of exceptions to the bill.</P>

<P>Hatch insisted, publicly and vigorously, that if exemptions were allowed, the bill would unravel. That provided crucial cover for other conservatives, and the Senate passed the act unamended in October 1993.</P>

<P>Such defections have drawn criticism from Hatch's compatriots on the right. Thomas Jipping, who heads the Center for Law and Democracy at the conservative Free Congress Foundation, acknowledges that he does not always agree with Hatch's compromises. "He has a 'don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good' kind of legislative approach rather than a 'go for the gusto every time and let the chips fall where they may' style," Jipping says. "But as Senate Hatch likes to remind me, I wasn't elected to the Senate, he was."</P>

<P>The area where Hatch most consistently shows his gentler side is health. Hatch seems genuinely intrigued by medical issues. "He would borrow my medical textbooks," recalls F. Edwin Froelich, a physician and former aide to the Senate's Labor and Human Resources Committee, which Hatch chaired. "I know he read them, because he would call me with questions. I'd have to go and periodically clear my books off his bookshelves."</P>

<P>Hatch has been so approachable on health issues that some Democrats say they would rather work with him than someone like Sen. Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.). Kassebaum is more moderate but less flexible; Hatch is conservative, but willing to deal.</P>

<P>Take AIDS. The issue blew up in 1990 during debate on the Americans with Disabilities Act, a bill Hatch co-sponsored to guarantee equal rights for people with disabilities. With the ADA on the verge of passage, Helms proposed an explosive exception: Restaurants could remove food-handlers with AIDS. Helms apparently hoped this would split the ADA coalition. "The sole purpose of the amendment was to kill the ADA," asserts McGuiness, Hatch's former aide.</P>

<P>Pro-ADA activists asked Hatch to help fight the Helms proposal. After he determined that there was no public health justification for the Helms exception, Hatch quickly came up with a counterproposal that would allow restaurants to remove only food- handlers who develop diseases communicable through food; AIDS is not. Hatch's proposal would give cover to lawmakers skittish about openly supporting AIDS victims.</P>

<P>Tension built as the debate began. Clusters of lobbyists representing the disabled and restaurateurs huddled anxiously outside. After Hatch and others made a series of impassioned speeches, the Helms provision was defeated. The Senate then approved the ADA with a 91-6 vote. Outside the Senate cloakroom, an enraged Helms could be heard bellowing at Hatch, says Thomas Sheridan, a lobbyist for the ADA.</P>

<P>While Hatch says he does not condone homosexuality, he again locked horns with Helms when Helms repeatedly linked AIDS with homosexuality during discussion of a $600 million AIDS treatment bill Hatch co-sponsored in 1990. Hatch took the Senate floor for a breathtaking speech.</P>

<P>"I do not want to condemn to death any person who has AIDS in this country," Hatch told his colleagues. "I do not care, in all honesty, what it was that caused them to contract the disease. . . . I just want to help them. It is fair to say that AIDS is a flagrant, widespread epidemic of high-risk conduct in many of the people. But let me tell my colleagues, everybody in our society from time to time makes mistakes. Many people have emotional illnesses or mental diseases. Many people have not had the privileges that many of the rest of us have had. . . . Any of us who may stand by and criticize better look at ourselves. We better look into our own hearts and our own minds and our own lives and if anybody, even in this body, does that, they are going to have to conclude that there are a lot of things they can improve upon."</P>

<P>Hatch insists that his fight for causes like AIDS funding is in line with conservative ideology. "I think a true conservative has to be compassionate," he says. "Take somebody who is personally disabled and really can't help themselves. What kind of society would we have if it didn't lend a hand?"</P>

<P>Such views leave gay activists with mixed feelings about Hatch. "He's a cooperative conservative," concedes William Waybourn, executive director of the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund. "He will never be a champion of what most of us understand as civil rights, but he does understand personal freedom."</P>

<P><B>Opposites Attract</B><BR>
Perhaps the best symbol of the softer Hatch is his friendship with Ted Kennedy. It is hard to imagine two more different characters than the freewheeling, liberal Catholic and the straight-laced, conservative Mormon. Kennedy was born rich; Hatch worked his way up from poverty. Kennedy's drinking has brought him trouble; Hatch's religion forbids drinking.</P>

<P>The relationship did not start well. "I came here to fight Kennedy," Hatch says. "I just felt like he exemplified everything that was wrong with America." He chuckles. "And to a large degree, I found out that he did. But I also found that there is a very good person there . . . who really sincerely wants to do well for people."</P>

<P>The turning point was Hatch's ascension to the chairmanship of the Labor and Human Resources Committee in 1981. Because of the committee's GOP contingent included several liberal members, Kennedy controlled the votes while Hatch controlled the chairmanship. Hatch faced a choice: scream at Kennedy and get nothing done, or work with him to churn out legislation. "I went to Ted and said, 'I've got to have your help,' " Hatch says. "And to his credit, he did help. And we became friends."</P>

<P>Moreover, they have become one of the most effective lawmaking combinations in history. Together Hatch and Kennedy have hashed out laws that limit employers' use of polygraphs, encourage development of drugs for rare diseases, and provide funding for job training. They also have teamed up to help pass a fair-housing law, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, drug and alcohol treatment programs, a series of AIDS grants, and numerous other bills.</P>

<P>When they join forces, they rarely lose. Hatch brings along so many conservatives, and Kennedy so many liberals, that a Hatch-Kennedy bill is almost assured passage.</P>

<P>"One of the things you learn on the Hill is that the Senate has about ninety-five talkers and five doers," says former Labor committee aide Froelich, now an associate at D.C.'s Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge. "The vast majority of members haven't [pushed through] a single bill. They've just been there and cast votes. You learn at the staff level who the doers are. Orrin, everybody would agree, is among the small number of members who are doers. And Kennedy is, too."</P>

<P>They still disagree on most things, of course. While Hatch and Kennedy do not campaign against each other, in their own races each will pump up crowds by telling them he is needed in Washington to fight the other. Hatch and Kennedy will often bellow at each other, red-faced, at a Senate hearing, and soon afterward will be chuckling together -- like friends who go all-out in a football game, then share a beer.</P>

<P>Sometimes the two simultaneously agree on one issue and disagree on another. Two years ago, they differed sharply on the morality of fetal transplants -- Kennedy was for, Hatch against -- but were united passionately on the religious-freedom bill. "I remember Orrin and I were fighting hammer and tongs about fetal transplants, then we'd go and testify together on religious restoration," Kennedy says, laughing. "We would literally leave the floor together to testify, then come back again and go at it again."</P>

<P>The relationship goes beyond politics. In 1991, then Labor secretary Lynn Martin invited Hatch and Kennedy to her office, ostensibly to discuss policy. When Kennedy showed up with a huge valise, Hatch was mystified. It turned out the meeting was a setup for a surprise 57th birthday party for Hatch. Kennedy, an amateur artist, opened the valise and presented Hatch with a painting he had made of the Kennedy compound at Hyannisport, Massachusetts.</P>

<P>Kennedy is not the only opponent Hatch has charmed. Many of his political adversaries find that Hatch makes a point of being decent to them. "He's a very well-mannered, courteous, respectful gentleman whose every view I take the opposite side of," says former Rep. Don Edwards, a California Democrat.</P>

<P>Some, though, detect a whiff of unctuousness in Hatch's manner. Shaking hands with someone and telling them how much you respect them, then voting against everything they stand for may make you a decent person. It also may make you disingenuous, a good politician, or simply someone who wants to be liked.</P>

<P>Perhaps most startling, Hatch regularly tells his colleagues he loves them, according to his aides; that is not uncommon among Mormons, but few use the phrase so freely with outsiders. One aide recounts that the crusty Howard Metzenbaum, former Democratic senator from Ohio, once muttered after meeting with Hatch, "If Orrin tells me he loves me one more time, I'm going to kill him."</P>

<P>Wilson, Hatch's former election opponent, is struck by Hatch's desire to please. "My personal style is not to say to people, 'I'm voting against you, but I like you.' I'd feel like I was pandering. But [Hatch] does it naturally. He so wants to please people. He's the perfect politician."</P>

<P><B>Chairman Hatch</B><BR>
His skills as the perfect politician will, of course, be put to the test during his reign over the Judiciary Committee. The first session Hatch ran as chairman, a hearing on the balanced-budget amendment, began at 10 a.m. on Jan. 5. Kennedy, white hair falling over a red, rocky face, forced his bulk through the crowd and up to the dais. Sen. Simon stopped to chat with reporters in his familiar bass.</P>

<P>When Hatch arrived, he was clearly the star. Lobbyists and staffers, who had been milling in an indeterminate throng, jostled toward him. Impeccably dressed as always, with a swirling lava- red tie and a dark suit, he conferred briefly with Kennedy, dropped into his chair for the first time, he got the one in the middle and smacked his gavel down three times.</P>

<P>"I want to express my thanks to Senator Biden and his staff for all the help they've given us during this transition,'' Hatch said in his taut monotone, nodding toward former Chairman Joseph Biden Jr. (D-Del.) "I wish I could say it's my pleasure," Biden answered ruefully.</P>

<P>Still, the Hatch-run hearing proceeded amicably. The Democrats, after all, are used to dealing with Hatch. And despite Hatch's differing personas, certain distinct patterns underlie his approach, patterns that provide a hint as to what kind of chairman he will be.</P>

<P>Hatch compromises more easily in some areas than others, something that is likely to continue. While he and Kennedy have served together on both the Judiciary and Labor committees, virtually all their partnerships have come on labor-related subjects -- health, drug treatment, job training.</P>

<P>Hatch's background seems to push him toward a fierce, unyielding morality on questions of legality and wrongdoing; that, too, is unlikely to change. In Judiciary's realm of black and white, right and wrong, Hatch has typically found little room for compromise. He is inflexibly harsh on criminals. After all, you are either for the death penalty or against it. Social programs, however, permit more flexibility; if you want to spend $200 million on an inner-city program and your opponents want to spend $800 million, maybe something can be worked out.</P>

<P>"On social and people issues, I understand people have different points of view," says Hatch.</P>

<P>Hatch sees, and no doubt will continue to see, many issues as morality stories, with a victim and a villain. Clearly that is true of crime; he seems unwilling to concede that a defendant may have been victimized too. Affirmative action, he believes, oppresses non-minorities. He saw Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas -- but not Anita Hill -- as victims. On the other hand, when it comes to the disabled or AIDS sufferers, he sees that they are victims too. And when he has been persuaded that the poor are victims, he has supported programs like child care and job training.</P>

<P>Hatch dislikes being labeled anti-feminist, anti-civil rights, or even anti-government, in contrast to many conservatives who could not care less, or even wear those labels with pride. "There are some conservatives who think that government is totally bad," Hatch says. "Well, that's just not true. There is a need for government. There is a need to have rules and regulations. But they ought to be reasonable."</P>

<P>And Hatch says he has mellowed over the years. "I'm still the same person," he says. "I still believe very strongly in what I do. . . . But experience does teach you to be a little more sophisticated, a little more personable."</P>

<P>Even Metzenbaum, the old liberal warrior whose office was across from Hatch's in the Russell Senate Office Building, grudgingly concedes Hatch has changed. "Generally speaking, Orrin is an able senator," Metzenbaum says. "He has become just a wee bit more moderate as his tenure in the Senate has extended."</P>

<P>Hatch has developed cordial relations not only with congressional Democrats, but with the Clinton administration as well. "It's been terrific to work with him," says Assistant Attorney General Eleanor Acheson, who coordinates the administration's judge-picking. "He has been very direct and straightforward to deal with."</P>

<P>As Washington enters a contentious two years, those good relations are likely to thrust him often into a mediating role between Gingrich Republicans and Clinton Democrats. "I'm not nearly so partisan today as I was when I came here," Hatch says. "I came here thinking I'm going to stop these Democrats. Today, I decry the partisanship. I'd like to see us work better together."</P>

<P>Thus far into the Republican onslaught, Hatch has taken moderately conservative positions. He pushed hard for the balanced-budget amendment and a line-item veto, for example, but did not support a requirement that Congress approve tax increases with a three-fifths majority. Hatch favors a school-prayer amendment, but one that would allow only silent reflection, not vocal worship. He has spoken in favor of limiting -- but not capping -- punitive-damage awards in civil cases. And he flat-out opposes imposing term limits on members of Congress. On crime, though, Hatch has co-sponsored a bill to make last year's draconian crime law harsher still.</P>

<P>Hatch also faces a task less concrete than churning through legislation: restoring the reputation of a Judiciary Committee whose public image still has not recovered from the debacle of the Clarence Thomas hearings.</P>

<P>Whatever Hatch does, it will at least be interesting. Dozens of bland figures pass through the Senate. Hatch is not one of them. "You can't throw Orrin into one category," says former aide McGuiness. "If you wrote a political novel, you'd have to have a character like Orrin in it. Otherwise it would be too boring."</P>

NICKERSON, District Judge:

    Plaintiffs, six members of the United States Armed
Services (the Services) who have stated that they are
homosexual, brought this action for an order (1)
declaring invalid under the First and Fifth Amendments
Section 571 of the National Defense Authorization Act
for the Fiscal Year 1994, 10 U.S.C.  654 (the Act)
concerning a new policy as to homosexuals, and the
directives issued under the Act (the Directives) , and
(2) enjoining the government from enforcing the Act and
the Directives.

    This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1331
and 1346. Venue lies here under 28 U.S.C.  1391.

    On April 4 and May 9, 1994, this court on
plaintiffs' motions preliminarily enjoined defendants
from enforcing the Act and the Directives against
plaintiffs based on their statements of sexual
orientation. Able v. U.S., 847 F. Supp. 1038 (E.D.N.Y.
1994); Able v. U.5~, No. 94 CV 0974 (E.D.N.Y. May 9, 1994)

    On September 14, 1994, this court granted
defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint as to
plaintiffs' intimate association, vagueness and
overbreadth claims, but denied defendants' motion to
dismiss the first amendment and equal protection
claims. Able v. U.S., 863 F. Supp. 112 (E.D.N.Y.
1994)

    While the motion to dismiss was pending,
defendants appealed the court's preliminary injunction
orders pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1292 (a) (1). On January
3, 1995, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
remanded the case, holding that this court had not
applied the proper preliminary injunction standard and
ordering consolidation of a preliminary injunction
hearing with a trial on the merits of the permanent
injunction. The Court of Appeals directed that "[the
preliminary injunction orders shall remain in effect
until March 31, 1995 upon which date they shall expire
unless reentered by the district court following a
trial on the merits. . . ." Able v. U.S., 44 F.3d 128,
133 (2d Cir. 1995) (per curiam)

    On March 6, 1995, this court held that under the
pleadings plaintiffs lacked standing to claim that (1)
the Act violates their right to expressive association,
(2) subsection 654(b) (1) violates their rights to free
expression and equal protection, and (3) subsection
654(b) (3) violates their right to equal protection.
Able v. U.S., No. 94 CV 0974 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 6, 1995).

    From March 13 to March 16, 1995 the court tried
the merits of plaintiffs' remaining claims.

              THE GENESIS OF THE ACT

    On January 29, 1993 President Clinton directed
then Secretary of Defense Les Aspin to submit a draft
executive order "ending discrimination on the basis of
sexual orientation in determining who may serve" in the
Services, in a manner "consistent with the high
standards of combat effectiveness and unit cohesion our
Armed Forces must maintain." Memorandum from President
Clinton to the Secretary of Defense (Jan. 29, 1993),
Ex. PX-21.

    On July 19, 1993, Secretary Aspin announced a new
policy as to the service of gay men and lesbians in the
Services, stating that "sexual orientation is
considered a personal and private matter . . . and is
not a bar to service entry or continued service unless
manifested by homosexual conduct. " Memorandum from
Secretary Aspin to the Secretaries of the Army, Navy
and Air Force and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff (Jul. 19, 1993), Ex. PX-180

    From March through late July 1993 the Armed
Services Committees of the House and Senate held public
hearings on the matter. Secretary Aspin presented the
administration's new policy to the Senate Armed
Services Committee on July 20, 1993.

    Both Committees issued reports recommending
legislation practically identical to what is now the
Act, which became effective November 30, 1993. The
Directives became effective February 28, 1994. On
March 15, 1994, the United States Coast Guard announced
its policy on homosexual conduct "in lock step" with
that of the other military services. Memorandum from
Secretary Of Transportation Federico Pena to the
Commandant, United States Coast Guard (Mar. 15, 1593),
Ex. JX-13 at p. B301327.

           THE ACT AND THE DIRECTIVES

    Section 654, entitled Policy Concerning
Homosexuality in the Armed Forces, contains in
subsection (a) "fifteen findings" that say, among other
things:

    (6) Success in combat requires military units
    that are characterized by high morale, good order
    and discipline, and unit cohesion.
    (13) The prohibition against homosexual conduct is
    a long-standing element of military law that
    circumstances of military service.
    (14) The armed forces must maintain personnel
    policies that exclude persons whose presence in
    the armed forces would create an unacceptable risk
    to the armed forces' high standards of morale,
    good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that
    are the essence of military capability.
    (15) The presence in the armed forces of persons
    who demonstrate a propensity or intent to engage
    in homosexual acts would create an unacceptable
    risk to the high standards of morale, good order
    essence of military capability.

    Subsection (b), setting forth the Act's policy,
states, in substance, that a member "shall be
separated" from the Services if one or more of the
following three findings is made:

    (1) The member is found to have engaged,
attempted to engage, or solicited another to engage, in
homosexual acts, unless the member has demonstrated,
among other things, that "such conduct" departs from
the member's usual behavior and he or she "does not
have a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual
acts."

    (2) The member "has stated that he or she is a
homosexual or bisexual or words to that effect," unless
"there is a further finding" made in accordance with
regulations that "the member has demonstrated that he
or she is not a person who engages in, attempts to
engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to
engage in homosexual acts."

    (3) The member has married or attempted to marry
someone of the same sex.

    Subsection (f) contains definitions. "Homosexual"
includes "the terms `gay' and `lesbian'" and means a
person who engages, attempts to engage, has a
propensity" to engage, or "intends" to engage, in
homosexual acts. The term "homosexual act" means any
bodily contact between members of the same sex to
satisfy sexual desires or any such contact that a
reasonable person would understand to "demonstrate a
propensity" or "intent" to engage in such an act.
The Act does not define the word "propensity."

    On December 21, 1993 Secretary Aspin issued a
memorandum and Directives concerning the implementation
of the new policy. Memorandum from Secretary Aspin to
the Secretaries of the Military Departments et al.
(Dec. 21, 1993), Ex. JX-4. They provided that an
applicant to become a member will not be asked about
his or her sexual orientation, that "homosexual
orientation is not a bar" to "service entry or
continued service," but that "homosexual conduct" is.
Such "conduct" includes not only homosexual "acts" but
also a statement by a member or applicant that
"demonstrates a propensity or intent to engage" in such
acts. A statement that demonstrates the "propensity"
will thus require separation unless the member rebuts a
presumption that he or she engages or intends to engage
in "homosexual acts" or has a "propensity" to do so.
Directives 1332.14, 1332.30, & 1304.26, Exs. JX-6, JX-
7, & JX-9.

    As examples of statements giving rise to the
presumption the Directives include "I am a homosexual,
"I am gay, " "I am a lesbian, " and "I have a homosexual
orientation." Id. The Directives purport to
distinguish homosexual "orientation" from homosexual
"propensity, " defining homosexual "orientation" as "an
abstract sexual preference for persons of a particular
sex, " and homosexual "propensity" as evidencing "a
likelihood that a person engages in or will engage in"
homosexual acts. Id.

     The Directives go on to say that "a statement
in homosexual acts is grounds for separation not
because it reflects the member's sexual orientation,
but because the statement indicates a likelihood that
the member engages in or will engage in homosexual
acts." Id.

     The Directives do not explain how an "orientation"
means an "abstract preference" if not revealed but if
admitted becomes evidence of a "likelihood" to commit
acts, a likelihood that requires discharge.]


     THE ISSUE BEFORE THE COURT

     The six plaintiffs have "stated" in their
complaint that they are "homosexuals." That is the
`only thing that they have done that is now before the
court. Under the state of the pleadings the court thus
does not consider the case to draw into question the
validity of any subsection of the Act other than
(b)(2).

    Subsection (b) (2) has two aspects pertinent to
this case. It provides for the discharge of a member
because he or she (1) has made a "statement" and (2)
the statement is of his or her status, that is, his or
her "propensity."

    Plaintiffs urge that subsection (b) (2) is invalid
both under the First Amendment and the equal protection
component of the due process clause of the Fifth
Amendment.

              THE LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE

   Before addressing the constitutional validity of
subsection (b) (2) the court looks to the text of the
entire Act to determine the end to which the Act is
directed.

    The Act says that its objective is to reach
"homosexual conduct, " that is, "homosexual acts" as
they are defined in the Act. Thus finding (13) in
subsection (a) says that the "prohibition against
homosexual conduct" in the military is "necessary."
Finding (15) indicates that the prohibition against
such conduct is so necessary that even those who have a
mere "propensity" to engage in that conduct must be
discharged from the military because their status as
homosexuals makes it likely that they will commit
homosexual acts.

    The statement "I am a homosexual" or "I have a
homosexual propensity" is thus prohibited by the terms
of the Act not because the statement itself causes harm
but because one can infer from it that the speaker will
do harmful things, namely, commit "homosexual acts"
injurious to "morale, good order and discipline, and
unit cohesion."

              THE FIRST AMENDMENT

   The free speech clause of the First Amendment
reads: "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the
freedom of speech."

    The first question for the court is whether the
government may under the First Amendment prohibit a
member of the Services from stating that he or she is a
homosexual, that is, that he or she has an innate
feeling within that indicates the status of a
homosexual.

    Plaintiffs' statements that they are homosexual
constitute "speech," and important, not trivial,
speech. The First Amendment recognizes the value of
speech not only as an instrument, that is, a mechanism
by which ideas may be exchanged, but also as an
expression of personal dignity and integrity. Speech
is worthy of First Amendment protection not only when
it contributes to the "marketplace of ideas" or assists
in the search for "truth, " but also when it articulates
"the premise of individual dignity and choice upon
which our political system rests." Cohen v.
California, 403 U.S. 15, 24, 91 S. Ct. 1780, 1788
(1971) . "Those who won our independence believed that
the final end of the State was to make men free to
develop their faculties. . . . They valued liberty
both as an end and as a means." Whitney v. California,
274 U.S. 357, 375, 47 S. Ct. 641, 648 (1927) (Brandeis,
J., joined by Holmes, J., concurring)

    Plaintiffs have done no more than acknowledge who
they are, that is, their status. The speech at issue
in this case implicates the First Amendment value of
promoting individual dignity and integrity, and thus is
protected by the First Amendment from efforts to
prohibit it because of its content.

    Regulation of the content of speech that involves
First Amendment concerns is presumed invalid. See
R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, --- U.S. ---, ---, 112 S.
Ct. 2538, 2542 (1992) ; Simon & Schuster. Inc. v. New
York Crime Victims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 116, 112 S. Ct.
501, 508 (1991) . The government may regulate its
content only upon a showing that such regulation
promotes a "compelling interest" and that the
government has chosen "the least restrictive means" to
further the interest. Sable Communications of
California. Inc. v. F.C.C., 492 U.S. 115, 126, 109 S.
Ct. 2829, 2836 (1989)

    The court recognizes that the judgments of
Congress and the military with regard to military
affairs are entitled to substantial deference, and that
courts "lack the competence" to make policy decisions
in the military context. See Goldman v. Weinberger,
475 U.S. 503, 507, 106 S. Ct. 1310, 1313 (1986)
Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57, 65, 101 S. Ct. 2646,
2652 (1981). But that does not mean that courts are
not competent or should abdicate their responsibility
to review the constitutionality of military decisions.
"When Congress' exercise of one of its enumerated
powers clashes with those individual liberties
protected by the Bill of Rights, it is [the courts']
`delicate and difficult task' to determine whether the
resulting restriction on freedom can be tolerated.
United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258, 264, 88 S. Ct.
419, 424 (1967) (citations omitted).

    A court need not determine the wisdom of a
particular military policy in order to determine
whether that policy conflicts with the Constitution.
Even in the military context, regulation of speech
based on content survives constitutional scrutiny only
if it is "no more than [what is] reasonably necessary
to protect [a] substantial government interest." Brown
v. Glines, 444 U.S. 348, 355, 100 S. Ct. 594, 600
(1980)

   A

    Defendants argue that subsection (b) (2) does not
offend the First Amendment because the subsection is
ultimately directed solely at the prohibition of acts
and gives members who reveal their homosexual
orientation" an opportunity to rebut the presumption
that a member with such an "orientation" will either
commit undesirable acts or has a "propensity" to commit
such acts.

    In advancing this argument, defendants reject old
myths previously offered to justify a ban on service by
homosexuals.

    From the early 1920's through the 1970's,
homosexuals were deemed unfit for service because
homosexuality was considered a "mental illness" or a
"personality disorder." See Prepared Statement of Dr.
David F. Burrelli, S. Hrg. 103-845, Ex. JX-1 at pp. 13-
14. In 1982, the Department of Defense issued a policy
mandating dismissal of homosexuals in part "to prevent
breaches of security" that presumably would arise if a
closeted homosexual were blackmailed. See id. at p.
15. Even as recently as 1993, some proponents of
retaining the complete ban testified that such a policy
was necessary because homosexuals are more likely, as a
group, "to spread infectious diseases such as hepatitis
and syphilis." See Statement of Col. John Ripley,
H.A.S.C. Hrg. 103-18, Ex. JX-2 at pp. 89-90.

    The legislative record shows that the Act and the
Directives are not premised on these beliefs.
Defendants do not contend that the new policy was
enacted in response to a finding that gay men and
lesbians have physical or psychological defects
rendering them unfit to serve, pose security risks, or
are more likely than heterosexuals to violate a code of
conduct or other rules generally. See Defendants'
Responses to Plaintiffs' Requests for Admission, Ex.
PX-13 at pp. 5-8. Indeed, defendants admit that
Congress "clarified that the proscription on service
has nothing to do with unjustified assumptions that
homosexuals are not just as capable physically,
mentally and psychologically to serve in the United
States military as heterosexuals." Transcript of
Defendants' Closing Statement at p. 256.

    High-ranking administration officials and military
officers certified the demonstrated ability of
homosexuals to serve competently and conscientiously.
Secretary Aspin, in presenting the administration's new
policy, testified to the Department of Defense's
recognition "that homosexuals have served with
distinction in the Armed Forces." S. Hrg. 103-845, Ex.
JX-1 at p. 702. General Norman Schwartzkopf noted that
"homosexuals have served in the past and have done a
great job serving their country." S. Hrg. 103-845, Ex.
JX-1 at p. 612. Major Kathleen Bergeron affirmed that
in her experience, homosexuals who eventually had been
separated "had an honorable record and served with
distinction." S. Hrg. 103-845, Ex. JX-1 at p. 612.
General Colin Powell, discussing the arguments of those
who believe that homosexuals should be allowed openly
to serve, stated that "[t]hey note correctly that
homosexuals have privately served well in the past and
are continuing to serve well today." S. Hrg. 103-845,
Ex. JX-1 at p. 707.

    Thus, the government, including Congress, believed
that the admission of homosexuals into the Services did
not pose an uncontrollable risk that they would commit
acts inherently dangerous to morale, good order and
discipline, and unit cohesion, and manifested that
belief by allowing homosexuals to enter the Services.

    The government's confidence was justified by the
fact that over the years thousands of homosexuals have
served in the Services ably and honorably before the
Act became law. By the time the Act was passed, the
old myths had finally been abandoned.

    But despite its recognition that homosexuals do
not by their nature pose a risk to the military mission
or lack competence as soldiers, the government elected
to allow them to join and remain in the Services only
on the condition that they remain silent regarding
their status. The government justified this condition
by saying that it needed to use a statement of
orientation as evidence of a likelihood to engage in
prohibited acts in order to forestall the commission of
such acts.

    To presume from a person's status that he or she
will commit undesirable acts is an extreme measure.
Hitler taught the world what could happen when the
government began to target people not for what they had
done but because of their status.

    Thirty three years ago the Supreme Court held it
was cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the
Eighth Amendment to subject an admitted narcotics
addict to a misdemeanor prosecution on the theory that
his addiction justified an inference that he had
possessed or in the future would possess drugs.
Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660, 82 S. Ct. 1417
(1962) . See also Powell v. Texas, 392 U.S. 514, 543,
88 S. Ct. 2145, 2159 (1968) (Black, J., concurring)
("Punishment for a status is particularly obnoxious,
and in many instances can reasonably be called cruel
and unusual, because it involves punishment for a mere
propensity, a desire to commit an offense; the mental
element is not simply one part of the crime but may
constitute all of it.")

    Robinson's status as a narcotics addict was self-
acquired. How much worse it is to infer the commission
of acts from one's homosexual status, which may well be
acquired at birth or in early childhood. See John C.
Gonsiorek and James D. Weinrich, eds., Homosexuality:
Research Implications for Public Policy 2 (1991)

    Defendants recognized that a policy mandating
discharge of homosexuals merely because they have a
homosexual orientation or status could not withstand
judicial scrutiny. As Jamie Gorelick, Counsel to the
Department of Defense, stated at the Senate hearing:
"The reason we do not discharge people because we
believe them to have a homosexual orientation is
because in 1981 it was recognized that if we did have a
status-based as opposed to a conduct-based rule, that
it would be vulnerable to the courts." S. Hrg. 103-
845, Ex. JX-1 at p. 777.

    Defendants therefore designed a policy that
purportedly directs discharge based on "conduct," and
craftily sought to avoid the First Amendment by
defining "conduct" to include statements revealing
one's homosexual status. To say "I have a homosexual
orientation, " a mere acknowledgment of status, is thus
transmogrified into an admission of misconduct, and
misconduct that the speaker has the practically
insurmountable burden of disproving.

    As noted above, the Directives purport to
distinguish between homosexual "orientation" and
homosexual "propensity," defining the former as the
quality of having an "abstract sexual preference for
members of the same sex" and the latter as the quality
of having such a preference that presumably is
sufficiently concrete to indicate a "likelihood" that
the preference will be acted upon.

    The court regards the definition and treatment of
these terms to be nothing less than Orwellian.
Although the Act and the Directives are written in such
a manner as to give the impression that there is a
principled distinction between the two characteristics,
only a brief critique will demonstrate that in practice
no such distinction exists.

    Neither the Act nor the Directives explain how to
differentiate an orientation'' from a ``propensity,
although the Act's avowed policy to insure that
"homosexual orientation" not be treated as a "bar" to
service would seem to make such differentiation
crucial. Those who formulated the policy testified
that any distinction between the two is merely
"hypothetical," Testimony of Counsel Gorelick, S. Hrg.
103-845,Ex. JX-1 at p. 800, and the Directives, as
decreed by Congress, equate a statement of
"orientation" with an admission of at least a
"propensity." See Directives 1332.14 & 1332.30, Exs.
JX-6 & JX-7, and S. Rep. 103-112, Ex. JX-15 at p- 294.

    These facts seem to the court to be powerful
evidence that despite their semantic gymnastics,
defendants themselves did not perceive a difference
between the two. Plainly they intended that the
articulation of a mere "orientation" be sufficient to
initiate a discharge proceeding. Thus, one who does no
more than express an "orientation" is faced with the
prospect of somehow showing that he or she does not
have a "propensity" to engage in prohibited acts in
order to avoid discharge.

    The word "propensity" is generally understood and
defined to mean a "natural inclination" or an "innate
or inherent tendency." Webster's Third New
International Dictionary 1817 (1986); see also Random
House Dictionary of the English Language 1152 (1966)
"Innate means "existing in one from birth" or
"inborn." Random House at 733; see also Webster's at
1165.

    Defendants make much of the opportunity to rebut
the presumption of propensity. But that opportunity is
an ignis fatuus. Neither the Act nor the Directives
suggest how one who is born with fro innate tendency, an
"orientation" or a "propensity," to commit a homosexual
act can prove that he or she does not have such an
orientation or propensity. Furthermore, the testimony
at the Senate hearing shows that a member who admits to
a homosexual orientation has only a "hypothetical"
chance to escape discharge.

    As stated by Ms. Gorelick, the rebuttable
presumption places a "very high burden" on the member,
and in a situation where "someone made the statement
[of homosexuality] knowingly and was not drunk or had
not lost his or her mind," it would be "very unlikely"
that the burden could be overcome by the member's
assertion that he or she does not engage or have a
propensity to engage in prohibited acts. S. Hrg. 103-
945, Ex. JX-l at p. 772. Indeed, Ms. Gorelick
testified that even if the speaker completely
disclaimed his or her acknowledgement of his or her
sexual orientation, asserting that "I was
misunderstood, I did not mean it, it was a joke," that
disclaimer would only "hypothetically suffice" to rebut
the presumption. Id.

    Thus, the policy treats a statement of homosexual
orientation as proof of the case. Once such a
statement is made, the speaker is judged guilty until
proven innocent of committing misconduct the government
considers so threatening to the military mission that a
member may be discharged for it. This seems to the
court a rather draconian consequence of merely
admitting to an orientation that Congress has
determined to be innocuous.

   Defendants point to three isolated instances where
Navy members have been able to escape discharge despite
having stated that they were homosexual as evidence
that the Act does not punish expressions of homosexual
orientation but merely uses them as evidence in an
effort to preclude the commission of prohibited acts.
See Administrative Ed. Records Nos. 13, 15, & 16, Exs.
DX-l, DX-2, & DX-3.

   An examination of the records (such as they are)
of these proceedings shows that the results were
aberrations stemming from a dysfunctional application
of the policy. In one, the member had said "she
thought she might be gay." In another, the member had
stated "I'm kind of confused about my sexual
preference." And in the third the member had said he
was homosexual only in what he thought was a
confidential session with a Navy counselor who tried to
make him "comfortable" and "as free as possible" so as
to get to the "root" of the member's problems.

    In each of these cases, the member stated at the
discharge hearing that he or she was gay, but was
apparently able to escape discharge by stating that he
or she had not engaged and did not intend to engage in
"homosexual acts." But Congress' specific intent was
that "a member cannot rebut the presumption simply
through a promise to adhere to military standards of
conduct in the future, nor can the member rebut the
presumption by a statement to the effect that he or she
has a propensity towards homosexuality but has not
acted on it." S. Rep. 103-112, Ex. JX-15 at p. 294.

    These three atypical results are obviously
aberrations that cannot be taken to show that the Act
holds out any realistic opportunity to rebut the
presumption.

    The plain fact is that subsection (b) (2) burdens
speech based solely on its content by subjecting the
member to a discharge process in which the member has
only at best a hypothetical chance to escape
separation. The Act works to discharge or subject to
discharge proceedings members who possess no more than
an "orientation" regardless of whether they have
engaged in or demonstrated a likelihood of engaging in
prohibited acts, and thus reaches speech that does not
indicate acts.

    This court concludes that under the First
Amendment a mere statement of homosexual orientation is
not sufficient proof of intent to commit acts as to
justify the initiation of discharge proceedings.

    In this court defendants argued something not even -
mentioned in the fifteen findings of the Act. In
substance, they contended that a majority of the
heterosexuals in the Services would not, for a variety
of reasons, like to know that there were homosexuals
serving with them and that this would result in a
serious detriment to "unit cohesion." Defendants now
say that the Services are justified in deferring to
this feeling of heterosexuals by imposing silence on
homosexuals.

    Defendants' advancement of this alternative theory
to justify the Act indicates that, once Congress
decided to try to get all known homosexuals out of the
Services, the chief concern was to draft legislation to
insure that the enactment would survive judicial
review. See also Testimony of Counsel Gorelick and
Gen. John p. Otjen, S. Hrg. 103-845, Ex. JX-l at pp.
775-78,812-21, 829-30. The Committee hearings show
that legal counsel thought the best way to do this was
to pretend that the concern was over, not the mere
presence of homosexuals in the Services, but their
potential acts. According to counsel, if the Act
provided forthrightly that open homosexuals shall be
banned because heterosexuals will not stand for them,
it would be vulnerable under the Constitution of the
United States. See Testimony of Counsel Gorelick, S.
Hrg. 103-845, Ex. JX-l at p. 777.

    So the lawyers evolved the Byzantine and complex
provisions described above. The Act was designed to
say nothing about heterosexual animosity towards
homosexuals. The Act's fifteen findings avoid using a
single word about heterosexuals, and fail to say what,
if any, effect the reactions of heterosexuals may have
on unit cohesion.

    Those who opposed the removal of the total ban on
homosexuals and testified at the hearings were more
candid. They said that the concern was with the
potential reaction of heterosexuals if they knew who
were the homosexuals serving with them.

    Although the Act's findings are silent as to the
response of heterosexuals to the presence of known
homosexuals in the Services, the court will analyze the
Act as if it said that a statement of homosexual status
was in itself an evil because heterosexuals would not
like to hear it and would react so as to damage unit
cohesion. See Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636,
648 n.16, 95 S. Ct. 1225, 1233 n.16 (1975) (courts need
not "accept at face value assertions of legislative
purposes, when an examination of the legislative scheme
and its history demonstrates that the asserted purpose
could not have been a goal of the legislation")

    There certainly was much testimony at the
Committee bearings, particularly from generals and
other high-ranking officers, opposing any lifting of
the ban on homosexuals because of the expected
reactions of heterosexuals. It is fair to say that the
bulk of the anecdotal testimony described how
heterosexuals would be prejudiced against homosexuals
because their "lifestyles" or "values" differed from
the "traditional" moral or religious "values" of
heterosexuals. See, e.g., Testimony of Maj. Bergeron,
S. Hrg. 103-845, Ex. JX-1 at pp. 630-31 (expressing
concern that members' children "be exposed to that
lifestyle"), Testimony of Capt. Gordon Holder, S. Hrg.
103-845, Ex. JX-1 at p. 544 (questioning ability to
lead subordinates "in an area . . . basically against
[his] moral standards) ; Testimony of Comm. James
Pledger, S. Hrg. 103-845, Ex. JX-1 at pp. 541-42
(reporting that significant number of his crew "took
exception" to lifting ban "based on moral
convictions")

    General John P. Otjen, a staunch opponent of any
lifting of the ban and the chairman of the Military
Working Group that recommended the policy that
eventually became the Act, sounded a theme repeatedly
stated by high-ranking officers that "when somebody
identifies themselves as homosexual" "that is
disruptive to unit cohesion. . . ." S. Hrg. 103-845,
Ex. JX-1 at p. 780. See also id. at p. 821 ("[B]ased
on my experience, [a] statement [of homosexual
orientation] alone will cause disruption within the
unit.").

    General Schwartzkopf testified that "[t]he
introduction of an open homosexual into a small unit
immediately polarizes that unit." S. Hrg. 103-845, Ex.
JX-1 at pp. 595-96. See also S. Rep. 103-112, Ex. JX-
15 at pp. 279-80. General Powell said that
"[h]omosexuals over history who have been willing to
keep their orientation private have been successful
members. . . ," S. Hrg. 103-845, Ex. JX-1 at p. 708,
but that "the presence of open homosexuality would have
an unacceptable detrimental and disruptive impact on
the cohesion, morale and esprit of the Armed Forces."
Id. See also Sen. Rep. 103-112, Ex. JX-15 at p. 278.
The Report of the Association of the United States Army
stated: "Heterosexual animosity toward known
homosexuals can cause latent or even overt hostility,
resulting in degradation of team or unit esprit."
H.A.S.C. Hrg. 103-18, Ex. JX-2 at p. 337.

    This heterosexual animosity towards homosexuals is
by its terms based on irrational prejudices. But the
government advances two arguments to attempt to refute
the fact that the policy of requiring secrecy was based
on irrational stereotypes.

    First, they say that the policy "seeks to
accommodate the privacy interests of servicemembers.

    This seems to the court the most incongruous of
arguments. After passage of the Act the showers, the
latrines and the barracks became no more private than
they were before. As defendants say, "Privacy is
extremely limited in the military."

    To "accommodate" the privacy of heterosexuals
presumably means, for example, to keep their naked
bodies safe in the showers from the stares of
homosexuals. But if indeed there are homosexuals who
wish to peek at naked bodies, they might do so quite as
readily when their orientation is a secret as when it
is open. The only difference will be that
heterosexuals will not know which of their servicemates
are homosexuals, and heterosexuals will have reason to
have a generalized suspicion of everyone in the
showers, hardly a circumstance likely to increase
"cohesion."

    To suggest to heterosexuals that the secrecy
policy will "accommodate" their privacy interests is to
attempt to mislead them. They are not dunces or
ostriches. They can hardly be unaware that because of
the passage of the Act homosexuals are serving with
them.

    Second, defendants contend that the policy somehow
addresses the concern about "sexual tension" in the
unit. The argument is based on the proposition that
homosexuals, following their "tendencies," will behave
in improper ways that will give rise to such tension.

    This was an argument advanced before the Senate
Committee in support of the total ban on homosexuals.
See. e.g., S. Hrg. 103-845, Ex. JX-1 at pp. 535-36
(testimony of Fleet Master Chief Ronald Carter), pp.
763-64 (statement of Gen. Gordon Sullivan), pp. 604-05
(testimony of Maj. Bergeron). It can hardly have force
now when homosexuals are not banned and will be serving
in units. There is no reason to believe that such
improper behavior, if it occurs, would be more likely
to occur because a homosexual had admitted his
orientation rather than kept it a secret.

    Moreover, inappropriate behavior by a homosexual,
whether in the closet or not, is susceptible of control
by the general regulations. The Uniform Code of
Military Justice, 10 U.S.C.  801 et seq., contains
numerous provisions that target such misconduct,
prohibiting rape, 10 U.S.C.  920, sexual harassment,
10 U.S.C.  893, and fraternization, 10 U.S.C.  934.

    There was, of course, evidence presented to
Congress to the effect that the presence of individuals
who acknowledged their homosexual orientation would
cause no significant breakdown in cohesion. In a
report commissioned by Secretary Aspin, an
interdisciplinary team of researchers from the National
Defense Research Institute of the RAND Corporation (the
RAND Group) concluded that "although some disruptions
might result from having acknowledged homosexuals
serving in the military," "the experience of analogous
organizations . . . suggests that any increase is
likely to be quite small," RAND National Defense\
Research Institute, Sexual Orientation and U.S.
Military Personnel Policy: Options and Assessment
(1993) (the Rand Report), Ex. PX-1 at p. xxiv. The
RAND Group noted that in Canada, Israel, the
Netherlands, and Norway, "countries that have policies
of complete nondiscrimination," "no serious problems
were reported concerning the presence of homosexuals in
the force." Rand Report, Ex. PX-l at p. 14.

    A report by the United States General Accounting
Office (the GAO) in 1992 also recounted that analogous
organizations that have "accepted homosexuals into
their ranks . . . have generally not reported adverse
impacts." GAO, Report to Congressional Requesters,
Defense Force Management: DoD's Policy on Homosexuality
(Jun. 1992), Ex. PX-5 at p. 43.

    Furthermore, the RAND Group noted that although
the military had expressed in the 1940's similar,
indeed almost identical, fears about the reactions of
white members if there was racial integration of the
Services, in fact integration "did not `destroy' unit
cohesion and military effectiveness." Rand Report, Ex.
PX-1 at p. 189.

    While the empirical evidence developed by neutral
and objective organizations such as the RAND Group
supports the conclusion that any disruption would
probably be quite small, the court will assume arguendo
that Congress could have made a finding in the Act that
the reactions of heterosexuals would have a larger
impact. But even if the Act had included such a
finding, there are factors other than those mentioned
in the hearings that cast doubt on any such conclusion.

    What the court deems extraordinary is the almost
total lack of concern evidenced in the Congressional
hearings and the Committee reports as to the impact on
unit cohesion of the attempt to enforce secrecy on
homosexuals and to enlist them in the perpetration of a
hoax on heterosexuals. Common sense suggests that a
policy of secrecy, indeed what might be called a policy
of deception or dishonesty, will call unit cohesion
into question.

    If there is one thing that is undisputed and seems
self-evident, it is that cohesion depends on mutual
trust within the unit. The honor code for
servicemembers provides that they will not lie or
cheat, and for good reason. Honesty is a quality that
attracts respect. Secrecy and deception invite
suspicion, which in turn erodes trust, the rock on
which cohesion is built.

    The policy of the Act is not only inherently
deceptive. It also offers powerful inducements to
homosexuals to lie. An enlisted member may ask another
enlisted member his or her sexual orientation.
Testimony of Counsel Gorelick and Gen. Otjen, S. Hrg.
103-845,Ex. JX-1 at pp. 810-11. It is true that a
homosexual may answer "no comment." But a homosexual
who answers truthfully is subject to discharge
proceedings. A heterosexual is not. The pressure to
lie is obvious.

    There are no findings, even in the Committee
reports, assessing whether a policy of secrecy and
deception is more or less deleterious to unit cohesion
than would be a policy of openness and honesty. The
court has no findings before it calculating the net
effect of the policy on unit cohesion.

    The task of this court is to determine the
constitutionality of the policy adopted by Congress,
not its morality. But heterosexuals and homosexuals
alike would be entitled to think it demeaning and
unworthy of a great nation to base a policy on pretense
rather than on truth. To invite someone with a
homosexual orientation to join the Services, then to
throw that person out solely because that orientation
is revealed from something he or she said, and finally
to pretend that the discharge was not because of the
person's orientation, might appear to all members,
heterosexual and homosexual, less than honorable, with
incalculable effect on "high morale, good order and
discipline, and unit cohesion."

    Even if the First Amendment were to tolerate the
prohibition of a truthful self-identification by
homosexual because it offends the sensibilities of some
heterosexuals it surely would require a legislative
finding that the consequences of disclosure would be
infinitely more serious than anything revealed in the
record before Congress. Even General Otjen conceded
that the Services would fulfill their mission if
homosexuals were permitted to reveal their orientation.
See Deposition of General Otjen, Ex. PX-19 at p. 139
(confirming that subordinate members of the Services
follow their orders whether or not they like them).
See also Testimony of Gen. Calvin Wailer, S. Hrg. 103-
845, Ex. JX-l at p. 401 ("If the ultimate decision is
to allow openly declared homosexuals to serve in the
Armed Forces, I am confident that the military
leadership, as well as the military personnel, will
salute and make the best of that situation.")

    In any event the Supreme Court has held that the
First Amendment will not countenance the proscription
of the expression of an idea because others find that
idea repugnant.

    "If there is a bedrock principle underlying the
First Amendment, it is that the government may not
prohibit the expression of an idea simply because
society finds the idea itself offensive or
disagreeable." Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 414,
109 S. Ct. 2533, 2545 (1989) . See also Terminiello v.
Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 4, 69 S. Ct. 894, 896 (1949)
Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 187-88, 92 S. Ct. 2338,
2349 (1972); Simon & Schuster, supra, 502 U.S. at 118,
112 S. Ct. at 509.

    This principle applies with particular force
where, as here, heterosexuals find the mere idea of
homosexual orientation disagreeable based largely on
irrational stereotypes.

    The court holds that subsection (b) (2) of the Act
and its accompanying Directives are invalid under the
First Amendment.

              EQUAL PROTECTION


    The due process clause of the Fifth Amendment
makes binding upon the federal government the
Fourteenth Amendment's command that no state shall
"deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal
protection of the laws." See Bolling v. Sharpe, 347
U.S. 497, 498-99, 74 S. Ct. 693, 694 (1954).

    The court analyzes Fifth Amendment equal
protection challenges by the same standards as those
applicable to claims of violation of the equal
protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See
Weinberger, supra, 420 U.S. at 638 n.2, 95 S. Ct. at
1228 n.2.

    Because the Act gives to persons of one status,
heterosexual, the chance to exercise the fundamental
right of free speech and prohibits it to those of
another status, homosexual, defendants must at least
show that the policy is "tailored to serve a
substantial governmental interest." Police Department
of the City of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 99, 92
S.Ct. 2286, 2292 (1972)

    For the reasons discussed above, whether the
government intended that subsection (b) (2) prevent the
commission of prohibited "acts" or appease heterosexual
prejudices, defendants fail to make the required
showing.

    Even if defendants do believe that heterosexual
servicemembers will be so upset by a coworker's mere
statement of homosexuality as not to work cooperatively
in the unit, such a belief does not justify a
discriminatory policy.

    "Public officials sworn to uphold the Constitution
may not avoid a constitutional duty by bowing to the
hypothetical effects of private [] prejudice that they
assume to be both widely and deeply held." Palmore v.
Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 433, 104 S. Ct. 1879, 1882
(1984), quoting Palmer v. Thompson, 403 U.S. 217, 260-
61, 91 S. Ct. 1940, 1962-63 (1971) (White, J.,
dissenting). Congress may not enact discriminatory
legislation because it desires to insulate heterosexual
servicemembers from statements that might excite their
prejudices.

    The court holds that subsection (b) (2) of the Act
and its accompanying Directives violate the equal
protection component of the Fifth Amendment.

               CONCLUSION

    The court declares subsection (b) (2) of the Act,
10 U.S.C.  654(b) (2), and the Directives implementing
that subsection invalid under the First and Fifth
Amendments and enjoins defendants from enforcing them
against plaintiffs.

    So ordered.

OPENING STATEMENT OF LOUIS J. FREEH,
DIRECTOR, FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY
SUBCOMMITTEE ON CRIME
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
WASHINGTON, D.C.
MAY 3, 1995

MR. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE.

I APPEAR TODAY SHARING THE GRIEF AND IMMENSE SADNESS THAT ALL
AMERICANS FEEL IN THE WAKE OF THE BOMBING OF THE MURRRAH FEDERAL
BUILDING IN OKLAHOMA CITY TWO WEEKS AGO TODAY -- A HORRIBLE EVENT THAT
TOOK THE LIVES OF INNOCENT MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN.

MY HEART GOES OUT TO THE FAMILIES AND FRIENDS WHO LOST LOVED ONES IN
THE BOMBING AND ITS DEVASTATION. I PRAY TO GOD THAT THE SURVIVORS HAVE
A SPEEDY RECOVERY. SINCE THE BOMBING, MY FOCUS AND THAT OF COUNTLESS
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ACROSS THE NATION HAVE BEEN ON FINDING THE
EVIDENCE THAT WILL IDENTIFY THOSE RESPONSIBLE AND LEAD TO THEIR
CONVICTION.

MY SINCERE THANKS AND APPRECIATION GO TO EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THIS
MATTER -- ALL OF THE RESCUERS, LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL, AND THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

I AM PROUD TO BE THE DIRECTOR OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION.
I HAVE SEEN FIRSTHAND -- AT FBI HEADQUARTERS, IN OKLAHOMA, AND KANSAS
-- THE TIRELESS EFFORTS THAT ARE BEING MADE TO RESOLVE THIS CASE AND
BRING THE PERPETRATORS OF THIS HORROR TO JUSTICE. AT A TIME OF SUCH
ADVERSITY, I AM PLEASED TO ASSURE CONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS INVESTIGATING THIS CASE IN A MOST ADMIRABLE AN
COOPERATIVE FASHION. YOU CAN BE VERY PROUD OF YOUR FBI.

I HAVE SPOKEN WITH PRESIDENT CLINTON DURING THIS CRISIS. THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL AND I HAVE BEEN IN VIRTUALLY CONSTANT COMMUNICATION. YOU
SHOULD KNOW THAT BOTH OF THEM HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY SUPPORTIVE OF OUR
EFFORTS AND I THANK THEM BOTH. I WISH TO ALSO THANK THE PRESIDENT OR
THE QUICK AN DECISIVE ACTION WHICH HE HAS TAKEN DURING THE PAST
SEVERAL DAYS ABOUT TERRORIST INVESTIGATIONS AND FOR HIS STRONG SUPPORT
FOR FULL FUNDING FOR DIGITAL TELEPHONY.

THE ASSISTANCE OF LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL
TO OUR INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS. MANY OF THEM HAVE PROVIDED INFORMATION
BY WAY OF THE TOLL-FREE NUMBER THE FBI ESTABLISHED: 1-800-905-1514. AS
OF YESTERDAY, WE HAVE RECEIVED OVER 14,000 CALLS TO THIS TELEPHONE
NUMBER FROM ALL 50 STATES, PUERTO RICO, AND EVERY PROVINCE OF CANADA.

WHEN I TESTIFIED ABOUT TERRORISM LAST MONTH BEFORE THE FULL HOUSE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, I STATED THAT THE THREAT OF TERRORISM IS VERY
REAL, IS A DEADLY MENACE THAT SEEMS ABLE TO STRIKE EARLY ANYWHERE IN
THE WORLD, AND THAT IT KNOWS NO BOUNDARIES .

AS AMERICA IS COVERED IN BLOOD IN OKLAHOMA CITY, IT IS APPROPRIATE TO
PAUSE A MOMENT AND RECALL SOME OF THE IMMENSE SUFFERING WHICH
AMERICANS HAVE ENDURED AT THE HANDS OF TERRORISTS:

* IN APRIL, 1983, THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY IN BEIRUT, LEBANON WAS
BOMBED, RESULTING IN 16 DEATHS AND OVER 100 INJURED.

* A SUICIDE TRUCK-DRIVER BOMBED THE UNITED STATES MARINES BARRACKS IN
BEIRUT IN OCTOBER, 1983, RESULTING IN 241 DEATHS.

* IN JUNE, 1985, TWA FLIGHT 847 WAS HIJACKED. U.S. NAVY DIVER ROBERT
STETHEM WAS BRUTALLY MURDERED BY THE HIJACKER AND HIS BOY WAS DUMPED
ON THE AIRPORT TARMAC IN BEIRUT.

* MARINE LIEUTENANT COLONEL WILLIAM HIGGINS, PART OF THE UNITED
NATIONS PEACEKEEPING FORCE IN LEBANON, WAS KIDNAPPED IN FEBRUARY,
1988. HE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY MURDERED.

* PAN AM FLIGHT 103 WAS BLOWN UP OVER LOCKERBIE, SCOTLAND IN DECEMBER,
1988. AS A RESULT, 270 PEOPLE WERE KILLED.

* IN FEBRUARY, 1993, TERRORISTS EXPLODED A BOMB BENEATH NEW YORK
CITY'S WORLD TRADE CENTER, RESULTING IN SIX DEATHS AND HUNDREDS
INJURED.

* JUST LAST MONTH WE WITNESSED THE KILLING OF AMERICAN DIPLOMATIC
PERSONNEL IN KARACHI, PAKISTAN.

* TERRORISM HAS NOW EXPLODED INTO MIDDLE AMERICA.

OTHER TERRORIST INCIDENTS SHOULD ALSO BE RECALLED. THE HORROR AT THE
1972 SUMMER OLYMPICS IN MUNICH. THE TERROR PLOTTED IN THE PHILIPPINES
IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR AGAINST U.S. AIR CARRIERS SERVICING THE FAR
EAST REGION. WE MUST BE MINDFUL THAT ONE OF THOSE CHARGED IN THAT PLOT
-- RAMZI AHMED YOUSEF -- WAS ALSO CHARGED WITH THE BOMBING OF THE
WORLD TRADE CENTER. LAST MONTH, THE WORLD WITNESSED A TERRORIST ATTACK
IN TOKYO'S SUBWAY SYSTEM.

IN MY TESTIMONY LAST NOT, I STATED THAT "THE FACE AND THE HAD OF
TERRORISM ARE HANGING DRAMATICALLY..." THE MOST PROMINENT
INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST THREAT HAS BEEN THE EMERGENCE OF INTERNATIONAL
EXTREMIST GROUPS THAT USE CRIME AND VIOLENCE TO FURTHER THEIR
POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC OBJECTIVES.

AS THE BOMBING IN OKLAHOMA CITY MAKES CLEAR, HOWEVER, AMERICANS WITH
SUCH AIMS MUST ALSO BE CONSIDERED IN OUR PROFILE OF A TERRORIST. WE
CANNOT PROTECT OUR COUNTRY, OUR WAY OF LIFE, OUR GOVERNMENT AND THE
DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES THAT ENSURE OUR FREEDOMS AND LIBERTIES IF WE FAIL
TO TAKE SERIOUSLY THE THREAT OF TERRORISM FROM ALL SOURCES -- FOREIGN
AND DOMESTIC. THERE IS NO REAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ATTACKS PLANNED OR
PERPETRATED AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS HERE OR ABROAD. OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT
RESPONSE MUST BE THE SAME, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PLAN OR ATTACK IS
ORGANIZED AND DEPLOYED BY AN AMERICAN OR A CITIZEN OF ANOTHER COUNTRY,
WHETHER THE FUNDS SUPPORTING THE ATTACK ARE RAISED LOCALLY OR PROVIDED
BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS.

HOWEVER, THE CURRENT SCOPE OF FEDERAL CRIMINAL LAWS DOES NOT REACH
SOME VERY POSSIBLE AND TRULY FRIGHTING TERRORIST ACTIVITY. SUCH
ACTIVITY COULD EASILY BE THE BASIS OF CAMPAIGN TO AFFECT THE OPERATION
OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND DESTROY THE SAFETY AND CONFIDENCE
OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.

FOR EXAMPLE, IF, ACTING WITHIN A SINGLE STATE, A TERRORIST
ORGANIZATION ENTERED INTO A CAMPAIGN OF ASSASSINATION, KILLING
NON-FEDERAL OFFICIALS, LEADERS OF PRIVATE INTEREST GROUPS AND MEMBERS
OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC, THIS ACTIVITY COULD FALL ENTIRELY OUTSIDE OF
FEDERAL CRIMINAL JURISDICTION.

SIMILARLY IF A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION PUT UP POSTERS THREATENING TO
KILL OR INJURE NON-FEDERAL OFFICIALS, LEADERS OF PRIVATE INTEREST
GROUPS AND MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC, THE FBI WOULD BE HARD
PRESSED TO ARTICULATE A LEGAL BASIS FOR INVESTIGATING THIS ACTIVITY.

PERHAPS MOST FRIGHTENINGLY, IF A TERRORIST OR TERRORIST ORGANIZATION
ACTING WITHIN A SINGLE STATE CONSTRUCTED BOMBS OF INCENDIARY DEVICES
WITH INGREDIENTS THAT DID NOT CROSS STATE LINES AND PROCEED TO BOMB OR
BURN NON-GOVERNMENT OWNED ABANDONED BUILDINGS, OR MANY PRIVATE
RESIDENCES, THE FBI PROBABLY COULD NOT INVESTIGATE.

FEDERAL JURISDICTION FOR THE TERRORIST ATTACK IN OKLAHOMA CITY IS
PLAINLY BASED ON TITLE 18, UNITED STATES CODE, SECTION 844(F). THAT
LAW PROHIBITS THE DESTRUCTION, BY MEANS OF FIRE OR AN EXPLOSION, OF
ANY BUILDING IN WHOLE OR IN PART OWNED, POSSESSED, OR USED BY THE
UNITED STATES OR ANY DETENT OR AGENCY THEREOF. BECAUSE DEATH RESULTED,
THE DEATH PENALTY APPLIES.

THE EXAMPLES I MENTIONED BEFORE, HOWEVER, ILLUSTRATE THE SERIOUS GAPS
IN THE FEDERAL CRIMINAL LAWS PRESENTLY USED TO COMBAT TERRORISM. THERE
IS A NEED, THEREFORE, FOR A COMPREHENSIVE FEDERAL LAW AGAINST ACTS OF
TERRORISM COMMITTED IN THE UNITED STATES.

WITH THE TRAGEDY IN OKLAHOMA CITY, WE MUST INTENSIFY OUR FOCUS ON THE
THREAT TO AMERICA FROM WITHIN -- BY INDIVIDUALS A DOMESTIC GROUPS
WHICH MAY HAVE NO FOREIGN CONNECTIONS.

TERRORISM IS BEST PREVENTED BY ACQUIRING, THROUGH LEGAL AND
CONSTITUTIONAL MEANS, INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION RELATING TO GROUPS AND
INDIVIDUALS WHOSE VIOLENT INTENTIONS THREATEN THE PUBLIC OR OUR
NATION'S INTERESTS.

SINCE THE 1970'S, THE FBI HAS OPERATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
GUIDELINES ISSUED BY ATTORNEYS GENERAL. THOSE GUIDELINES WERE ISSUED
IN RESPONSE TO PRIOR PERFORMANCE BY THE FBI. SINCE THEN, INTELLIGENCE
GATHERING AND INVESTIGATIVE AUTHORITIES HAVE DEPENDED, IN LARGE PART,
ON WHETHER THOSE WHO ENGAGE IN TERRORISM ARE IDENTIFIED AS A DOMESTIC
GROUP OR AN INTERNATIONAL GROUP.

A DOMESTIC TERRORISM INVESTIGATION MAY BE INITIATED ONLY WHEN THE
"FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES REASONABLY INDICATE THAT TWO OR MORE PERSONS
ARE ENGAGED IN AN ENTERPRISE FOR THE PURPOSE OF FURTHERING POLITICAL
OR SOCIAL GOAL, WHOLLY OR IN PART, THROUGH ACTIVITIES THAT INVOKE
FORCE OR VIOLENCE AND A VIOLATION OF THE CRIMINAL LAWS OF THE UNITED
STATES." AS YOU KNOW, THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERNATIONAL
TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS ARE CLASSIFIED.

THERE IS A BROAD RANGE OF THREATS CONFRONTING THE UNITED STATES. MANY
ARE EXTERNAL. SOME, AS WE HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN, ARE INTERNAL. WE MUST BE
AS CONCERNED ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL OR A GROUP OF AMERICANS PLANING TO
BOMB AN OFFICE BUILDING AS WE ARE OF AN INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP OF
FOREIGNERS PLANNING TO DO THE SAME THING.

UNFORTUNATELY, THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS AND SEVERAL GROUPS IN THE UNITED
STATES THAT ARE ARMING THEMSELVES FOR POLITICAL CONFLICT WITH LAW
ENFORCEMENT OR GATHERING WEAPONS TO FURTHER A SOCIAL OR POLITICAL
CAUSE. I AM GREATLY CONCERNED ABOUT TERRORIST ATTACKS HERE ON AMERICAN
SOIL. THE ATTACKS ARE NOT ONLY AGAINST ONE OR TWO INDIVIDUALS -- THE
EFFORT, AS IN OKLAHOMA CITY, WILL BE TO MURDER AS MANY AS POSSIBLE
THROUGH A SINGLE BLOW.

I DO NOT SUPPORT BROAD AND UNDEFINED INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION EFFORTS
-- BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THOSE INDIVIDUALS
AND GROUPS ADVOCATING DEADLY VIOLENCE IN THE FURTHERANCE OF THEIR
CAUSES. THE FIRST RULE OF SELF-DEFENSE IS TO KNOW THE ENEMY WHO
INTENDS TO DESTROY YOU.

INTELLIGENCE SERVES A VERY USEFUL PURPOSE AND HELPS TO PROTECT THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A "DIRTY WORD."

I DO NOT WANT MY REMARKS TO BE INTERPRETED AS ADVOCATING INVESTIGATIVE
ACTIVITY AGAINST GROUPS EXERCISING THEIR LEGITIMATE CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHTS OR TARGETING PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH OUR GOVERNMENT. THE FBI
IS ENTIRELY COMFORTABLE WITH THE CONSTITUTION, DUE PROCESS RIGHTS,
CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT, LEGAL PROCESS, AND THE AMERICAN JURY SYSTEM.
THEY EACH PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE FBI.

LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT INTERESTED IN INVESTIGATING LAWFUL ACTIVITY.
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT CONCERNED WITH A GROUP SIMPLY BECAUSE OF ITS
IDEOLOGY OR POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY. THE FACT IS -- WE DO NOT NEED THE
BUSINESS. THE FBI HAS LOTS OF IMPORTANT WORK TO DO IN PROTECTING
PEOPLE AND THE UNITED STATES.

THE FBI CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT, HOWEVER, TOLERATE AND IGNORE ANY
INDIVIDUALS OR GROUPS WHICH ADVOCATE VIOLENCE -- WHICH WOULD KILL
INNOCENT AMERICANS, WHICH WOULD KILL "AMERICA'S KIDS." THEY ARE NOT
JUST ENEMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, THEY ARE ENEMIES OF MANKIND.

I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEAR TODAY. I WELCOME AN HONEST AN
DECISIVE DISCUSSION OF THE PROBLEMS AND THE SOLUTIONS. I STRESS THAT I
AM APPEARING TODAY IN ORDER TO DESCRIBE THE TERRORISM PROBLEM THE FBI
FACES AND WHAT WE NEED TO FIGHT IT. IF THE THREATS TO US AND OUR
CHILDREN ARE SUCH THAT CONGRESS WANTS NOW TO REQUIRE THAT CHANGES BE
MADE, THEN THE CONGRESS -- ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE --
SHOULD NOT HESITATE TO DO SO.

I CAN ASSURE YOU, HOWEVER, THAT IF CONGRESS CONFERS ADDITIONAL
AUTHORITIES UPON THE FBI, THEY WILL BE APPLIED SCRUPULOUSLY. MOST
IMPORTANTLY, THEY WILL BE APPLIED CONSTITUTIONALLY, IN THE BROAD
DAYLIGHT OF THE PEOPLES' OVERSIGHT.

THE FBI NEEDS TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF TERRORISM. FOR EXAMPLE:

* AS I TESTIFIED BEFORE, THERE IS NO COMPREHENSIVE FEDERAL
ANTI-TERRORISM LAW.

* THERE IS A NEED FOR A SINGLE COUNTER TERRORISM CENTER TO BE RUN BY
THE FBI AN SUPPORTED BY OTHER AGENCIES. TO DATE THE UNITED STATES
GOVERNMENT HAS NEVER HAD SUCH A CONCENTRATED ABILITY AND FOCUS.

* THERE IS NO PROHIBITION ON TERRORIST FUND-RAISING -- THE LIFEBLOOD
OF ANY TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.

* LAW ENFORCEMENT MUST BE ABLE TO TRACE MONEY, EXPLOSIVES, NUCLEAR
MATERIALS, AND TERRORISTS.

* THE USE OF PEN REGISTERS AND TRAP AND TRACE DEVICES IN
COUNTERTERRORISM AD COUNTERINTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS MUST BE EASED.

* IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL FOR INVESTIGATORS TO HAVE INCREASED ACCESS
-- SHORT OF A FULL-BLOWN GRAND JURY INVESTIGATION -- TO HOTEL, MOTEL,
AND COMMON CARRIER RECORDS FOR COUNTERTERRORISM AND
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS.

* THE FBI STRICTLY OBEYS THE LAW. AS WE HEARD THE CONGRESS AND
SUCCESSIVE PRESIDENTS AND ATTORNEYS GENERAL TELL US, IT IS CLEAR THAT
WE WERE TOLD TO INVESTIGATE DOMESTIC TERRORISTS DIFFERENTLY FROM
FOREIGN TERRORISTS. IF THAT IS NOT WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SPEAKING
THROUGH ITS CONGRESS AND PRESIDENT NOW WANT, THEN TELL US AND THE FBI
WILL OBEY.

* IN ORDER TO CONDUCT EFFECTIVE COUNTERTERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS, THERE
IS A CONTINUING NEED TO RECRUIT SOURCES, INFORMANTS, AGENTS, AND
SUPPORT EMPLOYEES FROM A BROAD CROSS- SECTION OF SOCIETY -- HERE AND
ABROAD. THAT TYPE OF RECRUITMENT EFFORT, HOWEVER, COSTS MONEY.

* AS WE ENTER THE 21ST CENTURY, THE FBI MUST HAVE FORENSIC
CAPABILITIES ON THE STREET AND IN THE LABORATORY THAT ARE ON THE
"CUTTING EDGE" OF TECHNOLOGY.

* LAW ENFORCEMENT MUST HAVE THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE RAPIDLY BY
RADIO AND OTHER FORMS OF WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS. LOCAL, STATE, AND
FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND AGENCIES MUST BE ABLE TO TALK
AMONG THEMSELVES, SO THAT A STATE TROOPER ON AMERICA'S HIGHWAYS --
LIKE OKLAHOMA -- HAS THE FULL BENEFIT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT'S KNOWLEDGE
AS HE APPROACHES CAR WITH A SUSPECT IN IT.

* THERE MUST BE FUNDING FOR LOGISTICAL SUPPORT IN COUNTERTERRORISM
OPERATIONS AND ACTIVITIES. THE FBI CURRENTLY RELIES ON THE DEPARTMENT
OF DEFENSE FOR THIS SUPPORT. ALTHOUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE HAS
BEEN EXTREMELY COOPERATIVE, THE FBI HAS BEEN REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE IT
FOR SUPPORT.

* ENCRYPTION CAPABILITIES AVAILABLE TO CRIMINALS AND TERRORISTS
ENDANGER THE FUTURE USEFULNESS OF COURT-AUTHORIZED WIRETAPS. WE MUST
CONTINUE WORKING TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM.

* THERE ARE NO LEGALLY AVAILABLE MEANS TO EXCLUDE AND REMOVE ALIEN
TERRORISTS WITHOUT COMPROMISING VITAL NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION.

* REWARDS SHOULD BE INCREASED FOR THOSE WHO PROVIDE INFORMATION
LEADING TO THE ARREST AND CONVICTION OF PERSONS WHO COMMIT ACTS OF
TERRORISM.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE BOMBING OF THE FEDERAL BUILDING IN OKLAHOMA
CITY, WE HAVE THUS FAR HAD SOME EXCELLENT INVESTIGATIVE RESULTS. I
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MUCH INFORMATION TO THE COMMITTEE ABOUT
THIS INVESTIGATION, BECAUSE IT IS ONGOING AND I DO NOT WISH TO
JEOPARDIZE THE INVESTIGATION OR THE PROSECUTIVE EFFORTS THAT WILL
ENSUE.

I URGE ANYONE WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THIS TRAGEDY TO COME FORWARD. OUR
SUCCESS DEPENDS, IN LARGE PART, ON YOUR HELP.

TO EVERYONE, I PROMISE TO PURSUE THIS MATTER WITH ALL AVAILABLE
RESOURCES.

RESOLUTION FOR INVESTIGATION

Whereas, the Select Committee on Ethics on December 1, 1992,
initiated a Preliminary Inquiry (hereafter "Inquiry") into
allegations of sexual misconduct by Senator Bob Packwood, and
subsequently, on February 4, 1993, expanded the scope of its
Inquiry to include allegations of attempts to intimidate and
discredit the alleged victims, and misuse of official staff in
attempts to intimidate and discredit, and notified Senator
Packwood of such actions; and

Whereas, on December 15, 1993, in light of sworn testimony
that Senator Packwood may have altered evidence relevant to the
Committee's Inquiry, the Chairman and Vice-Chairman determined as
an inherent part of its Inquiry to inquire into the integrity of
evidence sought by the Committee and into any information that
anyone may have endeavored to obstruct its Inquiry, and notified
Senator Packwood of such action: and

Whereas, on May 11, 1994, upon completion of the Committee
staff's review of Senator Packwood's typewritten diaries, the
Committee expanded its Inquiry again to include additional areas
of potential misconduct by Senator Packwood, including
solicitation of financial support for his spouse from persons
with an interest in legislation, in exchange, gratitude, or
recognition for his official acts;

Whereas, the Committee staff has conducted the Inquiry under
the direction of the Members of the Committee; and

Whereas, the Committee has received the Report of its staff
relating to its Inquiry concerning Senator Packwood; and

Whereas, on the basis of evidence received during the
Inquiry, there are possible violations within the Committee's
jurisdiction as contemplated in Section 2(a)(1) of S. Res. 338,
88th Congress, as amended:

It is therefore Resolved:

I. That the Committee makes the following determinations
regarding the matters set forth above:

(a) With respect to sexual misconduct, the Committee has
carefully considered evidence, including sworn testimony, witness
interviews, and documentary evidence, relating to the following
allegations:

(1) That in 1990, in his Senate office in Washington,
D.C., Senator Packwood grabbed a staff member by the shoulders
and kissed her on the lips;

(2) That in 1985, at a function in Bend, Oregon,
Senator Packwood fondled a campaign worker as they danced. Later
that year, in Eugene, Oregon, in saying goodnight and thank you
to her, Senator Packwood grabbed the campaign worker's face with
his hands, pulled her towards him, and kissed her on the mouth,
forcing his tongue into her mouth;

(3) That in 1981 or 1982, in his Senate office in
Washington, D.C., Senator Packwood squeezed the arms of a
lobbyist, leaned over and kissed her on the mouth;

(4) That in 1981, in the basement of the Capitol,
Senator Packwood walked a former staff assistant into a room,
where he grabbed her with both hands in her hair and kissed her,
forcing his tongue into her mouth;

(5) That in 1980, in a parking lot in Eugene, Oregon,
Senator Packwood pulled a campaign worker toward him, put his
arms around her, and kissed her, forcing his tongue in her mouth;
he also invited her to his motel room;

(6) That in 1980 or early 1981, at a hotel in
Portland, Oregon, on two separate occasions, Senator Packwood
kissed a desk clerk who worked for the hotel;

(7) That in 1980, in his Senate office in Washington,
D.C., Senator Packwood grabbed a staff member by the shoulders,
pushed her down on a couch, and kissed her on the lips; the staff
member tried several times to get up, but Senator Packwood
repeatedly pushed her back on the couch;

(8) That in 1979, Senator Packwood walked into the
office of another Senator in Washington, D.C., started talking
with a staff member, and suddenly leaned down and kissed the
staff member on the lips;

(9) That in 1977, in an elevator in the Capitol, and
on numerous occasions, Senator Packwood grabbed the elevator
operator by the shoulders, pushed her to the wall of the elevator
and kissed her on the lips. Senator Packwood also came to this
person's home, kissed her, and asked her to make love with him;

(10) That in 1977, in a motel room while attending the
Dorchester Conference in coastal Oregon, Senator Packwood grabbed
a prospective employee by her shoulders, pulled her to him, and
kissed her:

(11) That in 1975, in his Senate office in Washington,
D.C., Senator Packwood grabbed the staff assistant referred to in
(4), pinned her against a wall or desk, held her hair with one
hand, bending her head backwards, fondling her with his other
hand, and kissed her, forcing his tongue into her mouth;

(12) That in 1975, in his Senate office in Washington,
D.C., Senator Packwood grabbed a staff assistant around her
shoulders, held her tightly while pressing his body into hers,
and kissed her on the mouth;

(13) That in the early 1970's, in his Senate office in
Portland, Oregon, Senator Packwood chased a staff assistant
around a desk;

(14) That in 1970, in a hotel restaurant in Portland,
Oregon, Senator Packwood ran his hand up the leg of a dining room
hostess, and touched her crotch area;

(15) That in 1970, in his Senate office in Washington,
D.C., Senator Packwood grabbed a staff member by the shoulders
and kissed her on the mouth;

(16) That in 1969, in his Senate office in Washington,
D.C., Senator Packwood made suggestive comments to a prospective
employee;

(17) That in 1969, at his home, Senator Packwood
grabbed an employee of another Senator who was babysitting for
him, rubbed her shoulders and back, and kissed her on the mouth.
He also put his arm around her and touched her leg as he drove
her home;

(18) That in 1969, in his Senate office in Portland,
Oregon, Senator Packwood grabbed a staff worker, stood on her
feet, grabbed her hair, forcibly pulled her head back, and kissed
her on the mouth, forcing his tongue into her mouth. Senator
Packwood also reached under her skirt and grabbed at her
undergarments.

Based upon the Committee's consideration of evidence related
to each of these allegations, the Committee finds that there is
substantial credible evidence that provides substantial cause for
the Committee to conclude that violations within the Committee's
jurisdiction as contemplated in Section 2(a)(1) of S. Res. 338,
88th Congress, as amended, may have occurred; to wit, that
Senator Packwood may have abused his United States Senate Office
by improper conduct which has brought discredit upon the United
States Senate, by engaging in a pattern of sexual misconduct
between 1969 and 1990.

Notwithstanding this conclusion, for purposes of making a
determination at the end of its Investigation with regard to a
possible pattern of conduct involving sexual misconduct, some
Members of the Committee have serious concerns about the weight,
if any, that should be accorded to evidence of conduct alleged to
have occurred prior to 1976, the year in which the federal court
recognized quid pro quo sexual harassment as discrimination under
the Civil Rights Act, and the Senate passed a resolution
prohibiting sex discrimination in the United States Senate, and
taking into account the age of the allegations.

(b) With respect to the Committee's inherent responsibility
to inquire into the integrity of the evidence sought by the
Committee as part of its Inquiry, the Committee finds, within the
meaning of Section 2(a)(1) of S. Res. 338, 88th Congress, as
amended, that there is substantial credible evidence that
provides substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that
improper conduct reflecting upon the Senate, and/or possible
violations of federal law, i.e., Title 18, United States Code,
Section 1505, may have occurred. To wit:

Between some time in December 1992 and some time in November
1993, Senator Packwood intentionally altered diary materials that
he knew or should have known the Committee had sought or would
likely seek as part of its Preliminary Inquiry begun on December
1, 1992.

(c) With respect to possible solicitation of financial
support for his spouse from persons with an interest in
legislation, the Committee has carefully considered evidence,
including sworn testimony and documentary evidence, relating to
Senator Packwood's contacts with the following persons:

(1) A registered foreign agent representing a client
who had particular interests before the Committee on Finance and
the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation;

(2) A businessman who had particular interests before
the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation;

(3) A businessman who had particular interests before
the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Commerce, Science
and Transportation;

(4) A registered lobbyist representing clients who had
particular interests before the Committee on Finance and the
Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation;

(5) A registered lobbyist representing a client who
had particular interests before the Committee on Finance.

Based upon the Committee's consideration of this evidence,
the Committee finds that there is substantial credible evidence
that provides substantial cause for the Committee to conclude
that violations within the Committee's jurisdiction as
contemplated in Section 2(a)(1) of S. Res. 338, 88th Congress, as
amended, may have occurred, to wit: Senator Packwood may have
abused his United States Senate Office through improper conduct
which has brought discredit upon the United States Senate by
inappropriately linking personal financial gain to his official
position in that he solicited or otherwise encouraged offers of
financial assistance from persons who had a particular interest
in legislation or issues that Senator Packwood could influence.

II. That the Committee, pursuant to Committee Supplementary
Procedural Rules 3(d)(5) and 4(f)(4), shall proceed to an
Investigation under Committee Supplementary Procedural Rule 5;
and

III. That Senator Packwood shall be given timely written
notice of this Resolution and the evidence supporting it, and
informed of a respondent's rights pursuant to the Rules of the
Committee.

Statement bv Ambassador Kantor

Today I am announcing our proposed sanctions list in the section
301 case regarding barriers in the Japanese "aftermarket" for
replacement auto parts and automotive accessories. This follows
the May 10 unfairness determination that covers acts, practices,
and policies of the Government of Japan with respect to the
aftermarket that are unreasonable and burden and restrict United
States commerce.

The list consists of imports of Japanese luxury cars, which
would be subject to duties of 100 percent ad valorem. Imports of
vehicles on the list in 1994 were valued at approximately $5.9
billion. The models on the list are:

Manufacturer       Model

Honda         Acura Legend
              Acura 3.2 TL

Toyota        Lexus LS 400
              Lexus SC 400
              Lexus SC 300
              Lexus GS 300
              Lexus ES 300

Nissan        Infiniti Q 45
              Infiniti J 30
              Infiniti I 30

Mazda         929
              Millenia

Mitsubishi    Diamante (4 door sedan)

None of these cars is made in the United States.

In accordance with the requirements of section 301, we are
requesting public comment on this proposed action. Written
comments must be submitted by Monday June 19, 1995. There will
be a public hearing on June 8, 1995, to be continued on June 9,
1995 if necessary. The final determination will be made on June
28, 1995.

Because the list contains a narrow range of products, we do not
expect at this juncture that the final list would be altered
significantly. However, we will carefully consider, and fairly
evaluate, any and all information provided in this process in
reaching a final determination

This list is the work of an interagency team that made
recommendations to me. In compiling the list, we took into
account a number of factors. We sought to include a Japanese
industrial sector that would have an interest in having this
issue resolved and that was important to Japan. On the other
hand, we sought to minimize the adverse impact on the U.S.
economy. In particular, we wanted to minimize the impact on U.S.
workers, U.S. businesses, and U.S. consumers -- especially low
and moderate income consumers. - We also sought to include goods
for which there are alternative souces of supply.

I have asked the United States Customs Service to withhold
liquidation of entries of the vehicles on the list as of 12:01
am Saturday, May 20. If the increased tariffs go into effect, we
intend for them to go into effect as of May 20.

We welcome the statements of the U.S. auto companies that they
intend not to take advantage of this situation at the expense of
American consumers. - However, we need to ensure that we work
together to protect American consumers as we address the issue
of U.S. competitiveness in this automotive market and creating
high-wage, high-skill jobs.

STATEMENT BY AMBASSADOR MICKEY KANTOR

This morning I am announcing the President's decision on actions
to respond to the continuing discrimination against U.S. and
foreign competitive autos and auto parts in Japan.

Today we have delivered a pre-filing notification to WTO
Director General Ruggiero indicating our intent to invoke the
dispute settlement mechanism of the World Trade Organization to
challenge the continuing discrimination against United States
products in the market for automobiles and automotive parts in
Japan.

We believe the Government of Japan has failed to carry out its
obligations under the WTO, and continues to thwart open and
equitable trade, which is the objective of the WTO. Japanese
government actions have nullified and impaired benefits accruing
to the United States and other member countries under the WTO.

At the same time, pursuant to sections 301 and 304 of the Trade
Act, USTR has made a determination that certain acts, policies
and practices of Japan restrict or deny U.S. auto parts
suppliers access to the auto parts replacement and accessories
market in Japan, and are unreasonable and discriminatory and
burden or restrict U.S. commerce.

In the next several days, USTR will publish a proposed
retaliation list under section 301(b) and will seek public
comment.

In taking these steps, we are acting on behalf of U.S. companies
and U.S. workers in the automotive sector. They have put in
extraordinary efforts over the past decade to establish
themselves as world-class competitors.

But I believe that we are also seeking objectives that are in
the interest of Japan and Japanese consumers, who will benefit
from open markets, greater choice, and lower prices And we are
building support for the international trading system Because if

inequities of the sort that exist in this sector are allowed to
continue, the public will understandably come to doubt the
fairness of the system and lose faith in it.

Japan is more than a major trading partner of the United States.
It is a valued friend and ally, and a bulwark of peace,
stability and democracy. Our political and strategic relations
are very strong. In the trade area, the United States and Japan
have worked together successfully to help complete the Uruguay
Round and to strengthen the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
Forum (APEC).

But there is no denying that we have difficult bilateral trade
issues between our countries. This Administration came to
office---and remains---determined to open Japan's market. In the
past twenty seven months, the United States and Japan have
reached 14 trade agreements, in important sectors ranging from
medical technology and telecommunications to construction and
apples.

We have negotiated strong and fair agreements, we have made
progress, and we are seeing markets beginning to open. Last
month, for the first time ever, U.S. exports to Japan exceeded
$5 billion.

Unfortunately, however, in the most critical sector for our
economy, the automotive sector, despite thousands of hours of
hard work during efforts spanning 20 months, the United States
and Japan have been unable to reach an agreement.

Japan remains unwilling to take the steps necessary to bring
genuine market access and concrete results in a sector in which
Japan has a $37 billion dollar trade surplus with the United
States, accounting for nearly 60 percent of the overall
bilateral trade imbalance and nearly 25 percent of the U.S.
global trade deficit.

The Nature and Historv of the Problem: A Recap

". . . the one thorny problem that never seems to get solved is
the inaccessibility of the Japanese markets, not only to autos,
but also to auto parts." President Clinton in an interview with
the Detroit Free Press, May 4, 1995

This Administration has focussed intently on the challenge of
building an equitable trading relationship with Japan. Since
1971, in good times and bad, the United States has run a
merchandise trade deficit with Japan. Since 1980, these deficits
have stood at exorbitantly high levels, and reached a record
high of $63 billion last year. The composition of this deficit
disproportionately represents imbalances in trade of high value
-added manufactured goods, most particularly motor vehicles and
parts -- important sectors for high-wage high-skill jobs.

This Administration sought to lay the foundation for a new, more
balanced and cooperative economic relationship with Japan
through the "United States-Japan Framework for a New Economic
Partnership". In the auto and auto parts sector, Japan committed
in the Framework to:

the objective of achieving significantly expanded sales
opportunities to result in a significant expansion of purchases
of foreign parts by Japanese firms in Japan and through their
transplants, as well as removing problems which affect market
access and encouraging imports of foreign autos and auto parts
in Japan.

Japan and the United States reaffirmed these objectives in a
statement on May 23rd last year.

The automotive sector is important to achieving the Framework's
objectives precisely because it is so large and integral to bo+h
country's economies. Motor vehicle and equipment manufacturing
is the largest of all our manufacturing industries, and is the
cornerstone of our nation's industrial base. No other industry
has a bigger impact on America's economy -- 5% of our nation's
Gross Domestic Product over the past three decades.

The Big Three -- Chrysler, Ford and General Motors -- employ
over 690,000 workers on a payroll of $31 billion. They also have
a huge multiplier effect on employment throughout the auto
-supply industly. Together with suppliers and dealers, they
employ more than 2.5 million Amencans in literally thousands of
facilities and dealerships across the country.

The Big Three are among the largest purchasers in the U.S. of
natural and synthetic rubber, machine tools, glass,
semiconductors, aluminum, iron and steel. Since 1990, they have
invested more than $117 billion in plants, equipment, research
and development and workforce training.

We are trying to erase decades of market restrictions in Japan
which has resulted in substantial loss of jobs and business
opportunities in the U.S. and other countries. In 1953, the Big
Three U.S. auto makers had 57 percent of the Japanese market. At
that time, the Government of Japan decided that it was going to
protect the domestic automobile industry. Through high tariffs,
allocations of capital, and a range of other measures, the
Government of Japan in essence kicked foreign producers out of
the market. By 1960, the U.S. share was less than 1 percent.
When tariffs came down over the next decades, the range of
formal and informal barriers continued to lock U.S. and other
foreign competitors out of the Japanese market, nullifying and
impairing the benefits of tariff reductions.

The U.S. car market is wide open. Japanese companies enjoy a 24%
market share in the United States. We have a meager 1.5% share
in Japan. Overall in 1994 foreign vehicles constituted 4.6
percent of the Japanese market. In other G-7 countries foreign
share of the automobile market ranges from 33-57 percent.

We are absolutely committed to letting Japanese consumers decide
whether they find U.S. products attractive. What we insist on is
the opportunity for those products to be offered to Japanese
consumers.

The market access problems in the auto parts sectors are equally
severe. Foreign auto parts, from all countries, take only 2.6%
of the Japanese market. In the U.S. the market share for foreign
parts is 32.5%; elsewhere among the G-7 countries foreign parts
range from 16-60% of the market.

The American people, labor, industry, and Congressional leaders
and over 150 senators and Representatives from both parties are
united in their support for taking a firm position with respect
to Japan+s closed market. More than 15 major industry groups
recently called upon Japan to open its market.

The Negotiations Focussed on Three Areas

The negotiations focused on: automobiles themselves, original
equipment or original parts installed at the factory, and the
aftermarket, or secondary market, for replacement parts.

First, automobiles and dealerships.

Today, most U.S. auto dealers sell imported cars alongside
American label vehicles. The ability to sell through an existing
dealership network, rather than establishing all new dealers
from scratch, has been critical to the ability of foreign auto
companies, including Japanese companies, to enter and expand in
the United States. In Japan, only 20% percent of Japanese
dealers sell foreign and Japanese cars, and only 7 percent sell
American and Japanese cars.

Obtaining greater access to existing dealerships is key to
increasing foreign auto sales in Japan, because of the near
-prohibitive expense of starting a new network of dealers from
scratch. At the time in the past when it would have been much
more possible to do so, other barriers essentially shut foreign
companies out of the Japanese market.

The problem is one for all foreign manufacturers, not just the
U.S. Big Three. Just last week, the director of the newly-opened
Tokyo office of the European Automobile Manufacturing
Association, Anthony Millington, stated:

The European motor vehicle manufacturers are convinced that with
further deregulation of the market, and improved access to
dealer networks, it will be possible to achieve much greater
market penetration for the Europeans.

The Japanese Government is fond of stating how many models the
European manufacturers are offering in Japan as evidence of
their "greater efforts" than the U.S. Big Three. Yet with all
their models and supposed greater efforts, their market share is
2.8 percent. The European Business Council has said that if the
Japanese market were open, Europe would have a 10 percent share.

The U.S. Government proposed several reasonable measures
designed to improve the confidence of Japanese dealers that they
are free to carry foreign vehicles without fear of retribution.
On one key measure, the U.S. and Japan were able to agree in
principle: The Japanese Government would send a letter to each
vehicle dealer reassuring them that they are free to deal in
competing vehicles, and explaining to them their rights under
Japan's Anti-Monopoly Act.

On another key point, however, the two Governments could reach
no agreement. The U.S. position was that Japanese vehicle
dealers will not feel free to deal in foreign vehicles unless
they hear "an ok" directly from their current supplier. We
therefore asked for a proactive role for Japanese manufacturers
to make sure there was no intimidation of dealers. Given the
very real restrictions that Japanese manufacturers have placed
on their dealers in the past, it was perfectly reasonable, and
consistent with Japanese competition law and policy, to ask for
this involvement of Japanese manufacturers.

Second, the aftermarket/replacement parts.

The Japanese market for replacement auto parts is restricted by
a complex system of regulations that go well beyond what is
needed for safety or environmental protection. Instead, these
regulations accomplish three purposes: keeping out foreign
parts, raising prices for Japanese consumers, and providing big
profit margins for Japanese parts makers, who can therefore
charge less for the parts they sell to Japanese vehicle
manufacturers as original equipment.

In Japan, 40 percent of all automotive repair and maintenance
business is done in connection with regularly scheduled motor
vehicle inspections required under Japanese law. Most of the
inspections, and most of the repair work in connection with the
inspections, are performed at a select group of garages that
have received special designation from the Government of Japan.
These "designated" garages are either auto dealerships or other
large garages closely tied in with Japanese auto manufacturers
and their original equipment parts suppliers. They use virtually
no foreign parts.

The U.S. asked Japan for deregulatory measures to allow more
garages to get into the repair business associated with the
regular inspections. Japan refused to offer any deregulation in
this area whatsoever. It would neither allow for the inspections
and repairs to be separated -- so that a vehicle could be
inspected at a designated garage and repaired at another site --
nor was Japan willing simply to lower the barriers to becoming a
designated garage so that other garages, which may be less tied
in to Japanese manufacturers and more willing to use foreign
parts, could get into the business.

Japan also was unwilling to offer any meaningful deregulation of
its so-called "critical parts list". This list -- the exact
contents of which is known only to Japanese regulators --
includes most essential vehicle parts. The parts may only be
replaced by heavily- regulated certified garages which use few
foreign parts.

Japan was willing to offer some deregulation in other areas But
without any access to the core market associated with regular
inspections and repair, it was not possible to reach a
meaningful agreement.

Third, original equipment parts.

In the area of original equipment parts sales to Japanese
manufacturers in Japan as well as the U.S., the U.S. was
attempting to address a very real problem: the closed "keiretsu"
purchasing relationships between Japanese manufacturers and
their key suppliers. Despite the world class competitiveness and
strong price advantages of U.S. parts suppliers, Japanese
manufacturers simply are not responding to market forces. They
are continuing to exclude U.S. and other non-Japanese companies
from supplying high value- added, integral and designed-in
parts, and are relying on their keiretsu suppliers.

This fact poses a serious dilemma: we can never address the
tremendous trade imbalance between our countries and its
economic side effects unless we overcome the imbalances in this
sector. We cannot overcome the imbalances in this sector unless
the Japanese auto manufacturers take responsibility to do their
part, and to do what would appear very much in the interest of
their bottom lines in any case.

In the Framework, Japan specifically committed to addressing
original equipment parts purchases by the Japanese
manufacturers. Accordingly, it would have been entirely
appropriate for us to insist on addressing this issue in the
Framework context, including with the goals and objective
criteria of the Framework. However, in an effort to be flexible
and to respond to Japanese concerns, the U.S. agreed to address
this issue outside the Framework, through voluntary plans by the
Japanese manufacturers.

Because there was a history of voluntary plans by the Japanese
manufacturers -- which were welcomed by the two Governments and
which had achieved some progress -- we believed that the least
intrusive and most acceptable approach would be to pursue this
previously used avenue.

To address any concerns that the manufacturers might have, we
offered to agree to a "joint announcement" with the Government
of Japan that would make clear that any voluntary plans would
not be treated as commitments but as business forecasts.
Moreover, in specific response to Japanese Governments demands,
we asked the U.S. Big Three to commit to making statements of
their future intentions for the Japanese market with respect to
product introduction, marketing, and other factors. The Big
Three stood ready to do so.

However, the Japanese Government refused any consideration of
this idea, and refused to allow for any possibility of voluntary
plans. The Japanese Government adopted a rigid ideological
stance that appeared bent on failure, while we attempted to seek
practical solutions to real problems.

In short, the Government of Japan has refused to address our
most fundamental concerns in all areas. Discrimination against
foreign manufacturers of autos and auto parts continues.

THE UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE
Executive Office of the President
Washington, D.C. 20506

Mr. Renato Ruggiero
Director-General, World Trade Organization
154, Rue de Lausanne
1221 Geneva 21
Switzerland

Dear Mr. Director-General:

I am writing you today to give pre-filing notification of the
intention of the United States to invoke the dispute settlement
mechanism of the WTO to challenge the discrimination against
United States and other competitive foreign products in the
market for automobiles and automotive parts in Japan. It is our
intention to officially file a case with the World Trade
Organization (WTO) in approximately 45 days.

Through its actions and inactions with respect to the automotive
sector, Japan has failed to carry out its obligations under the
WTO, has nullified and impaired benefits accruing to the United
States under the WTO, and has fostered a situation in the
automotive sector that nullifies and impairs such benefits, and
impedes the attainment of important objectives of the GATT and
the WTO.

The market access problems in the automotive sector reflect
problems endemic in many sectors in Japan. Relative to gross
domestic product, Japan imports far fewer manufactured goods
than any other G-7 country and maintains a persistent surplus in
its global trade and current accounts. Japan's imports of
manufactured goods are one-fifth to one-tenth the level of
European countries and nearly one-third the level of the United
States, relative to GDP. Overregulation, toleration of market
restrictive practices and market structures, and pervasive and
unwarranted intervention in the Japanese economy all work
together to systematically discriminate against foreign
competitive imports.

The United States has focussed on the automotive sector because
of its central importance to the United States and other
economies, and its huge contribution to the U.S.-Japan trade
imbalance. This sector accounts for almost 5 percent of the U.S.
GDP, and it directly provides jobs for 2.5 million Americans.
The 1994 U.S.-Japan trade imbalance in the automotive sector was
$37 billion, nearly 60 percent of the total U.S. trade deficit
with Japan and nearly a quarter of the entire U.S. global trade
deficit.

This trade imbalance reflects a lack of access for foreign autos
and auto parts to the Japanese market for the past 35 years. In
Japan today, foreigr automobiles have a 4.6 percent share of the
market. In the United States, foreign autos occupy a 32.5
percent share of the market. Throughout the rest of the G-7,
foreign cars range from 33 to 55 percent of the market. In
Japan, foreign auto parts account for only 2.6 percent of the
market. In the United States, foreign parts make up 37 percent
of the market. Throughout the rest of the G-7, the market share
of foreign parts ranges from 16 to 60 percent.

While we are first and foremost concerned about the impact of
Japan's automotive barriers and restrictive practices on the
interests of U.S. companies and workers, this is a general
international economic problem, adversely affecting the
interests of many trading nations. Japan's huge trade imbalances
in the automotive sector contribute substantially to unstable
international economic conditions which undermine global
economic recovery and growth, and the health of the
international trading system.

The Government of Japan in the past implemented measures to
protect the domestic automobile industry, such as discriminatory
allocation of capital, foreign investment restrictions, high
tariffs, and a range of other measures. As these barriers were
removed and as tariffs were reduced through multilateral tariff
negotiations, the Government-of Japan developed other measures
to protect domestic producers from foreign competition. Such
measures included, among others, excessively burdensome
inspection requirements for imported vehicles, discriminatory
access to vehicle registration data, and maintaining an
unreasonably complex system of motor vehicle inspection and
repair re+ulations.

At the same time, the Japanese automotive sector as it has
developed has been pervasively characterized by close
interlocking relationships between auto manufacturers,
suppliers, distributors, dealers, and those who repair and
inspect cars. The Government of Japan has guided or tolerated
the creation by industry of informal market restrictive measures
and market structures, which have played a critical role in
excluding foreign competitive suppliers of autos and auto parts
from the market.

Foreign motor vehicle manufacturers now face a situation in
which limited access to auto dealerships -- which until recently
were prohibited from carrying products from competing suppliers
and which still fear that carrying a competitor's products will
damage their relationship with their current supplier --
seriously impedes market access. In addition, foreign auto parts
suppliers find it virtually impossible to sell high value-added
parts to Japanese manufacturers.

In the auto parts aftermarket, excessive and complex regulations
channel most repairs to garages tied closely to Japanese parts
manufacturers, which results in market discrimina+ion. While we
are very conscious of the need for any country to establish
regulatior.s pertaining to safety and the environment, the
Japanese regulations in the aftermarket go far beyond what is
necessary to protect those interests, and are applied with the
effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade.
Japan has chosen to create and maintain a regulatory system
which effectively locks out foreign competitors and imposes
extraordinary additional costs on Japanese consumers. According
to our estimates, Japan's 34 million households would save $24
billion annually from deregulation of the auto parts
aftermarket.

As you are aware, the United States and Japan have been
discussing measures to substantially increase access and sales
of foreign competitive autos and auto parts in the Japanese
market. After long negotiations, the United States and Japan
have been unable to reach agreement regarding any of the three
principal areas -- access and sales of motor vehicles, original
equipment parts, and replacement parts -- that are crucial to a
meaningful solution.

I have directed a task force of lawyers and economists to ready
our case for submission to the WTO. I must underline the
seriousness of our intentions in this matter.

Yours sincerely,

/ s /

HISTORY OF U.S. AUTO COMPANIES IN JAPAN

Prior to World War II, U.S. auto companies were the major force
in Japan's auto industry. The U.S. presence in Japan started in
1909, when Ford first established an agent to handle its imports
into Japan. General Motors followed in 1915, when it established
Yanase as its agent, a relationship which continues today after
a hiatus during World War II. Dodge and Chrysler started Japan
operations in the 1920s.

After the Great Kanto Earthquake (1923) destroyed much of Tokyo,
the Japanese government stepped up imports and encouraged
foreign companies to build cars in Japan. Ford began assembly
operations in Yokohama in 1925, General Motors established an
assembly plant in Osaka in 1927, and Chrysler in Yokohama in
1930 Ford became Japan's leading auto producer upon adding
Asia's first automatic conveyor assembly line to their Yokohama
plant in 1927, allowing them to produce 10,000 vehicles per
year. Domestic production by Japanese manufacturers did not
reach a level of 1,000 units per year until 1930 Nissan did not
establish production until 1933 and Toyota, not until 1937.

The Japanese Government began to restrict activities of foreign
automakers in Japan in the mid-1930s. In 1935, Ford was
prevented from carrying out a planned expansion. Shortly after
that, the Automotive Manufacturing Industries Law was passed,
which protected the domestic industry and limited production by
foreign-owned plants. +issan and Toyota became the only
authorized domestic manufacturers. By 1939, foreign-owned
production had stopped in Japan, and remaining U.S. assets were
expropriated by the Japanese Government in December 1941

After World War II, occupation forces concentrated on getting
domestic vehicle production re-established. They began by
authorizing domestic truck production and by banning sales of
imported vehicles to the general public. Car production in Japan
was resumed in 1947 on a limited basis. In 1949, occupation
forces lifted remaining limits on car production, but the
Japanese Government enacted the Foreign Exchange and Foreign
Trade Control Law, which gave MITI effective control over
allocation of foreign exchange. The import ban was partially
lifted in 1950, and lifted-entirely by the end of the Occupation
in 1952. By 1953, imports accounted for 60% of all registrations
in Japan.

After the war, Chrysler, Ford and GM all re-established
representation in Japan, but activities were severely limited by
Japanese Government policies which protected and fostered their
domestic auto industry The Japanese Government protected Japan's
automakers through preferential allocation of foreign currency,
providing technical assistance for auto parts makers,
restricting foreign investment, restricting vehicle imports,
putting protective tariffs on imports, leveling high commodity
taxes on large cars, establishing complex type-approval
procedures, and by banning use of imported vehicles by
government offices. The cumulative effect of these restrictions
resulted in a drop in foreign share of Japan's market, from 60%
in 1953 to around 1% in 1960.

Although economic conditions in Japan have changed significantly
over the past 40 years, import share did not reach 2% until the
late 1980s, and stands at 4.6% today.

It is clear that at a time when foreign manufacturers were in a
position to develop operations in Japan, either by direct
investment or by establishing sales networks, the Japanese
Government actively prevented entry. U S. companies were
effectively thrown out of Japan in the early 1950s, just as thev
had been prior to World War II and kept out until the domestic
companies had established dominant positions in Japanese export
markets.

Current Restrictions

Besides the difficulty of trying to overcome 50 years of
protectionism, seven major problem areas remain for sales of
U.S. vehicles in Japan:

* Dealer Access

* Regulatory and Certification Issues

* Vehicle Registration System

* Access to Vehicle Owner Data

* Purchase of U.S.-made Components

Dealer Access. In Spite of the limited number of break through
franchise agreements which have been completed, it is apparent
that the Japanese manufacturers intend to continue maintaining
control over their dealer bodies. Most Japanese manufacturers
continue to make it clear informally that consideration of
foreign franchises by their dealers is unacceptable -- even when
dealers have publicly stated their desire to have such
franchises.

In the U.S. market, Japanese auto manufacturers enjoy complete
freedom to make any dealer arrangements they wish, and Japanese
companies have benefitted greatly by having access to strong,
experienced dealers of the U.S manufacturers for market entry.

It is widely recognized that Japanese dealers have over-capacity
in the retail distribution system. Thus, the diversification
represented by franchises for foreign products is mutually
attractive, since Japanese dealers will be provided an
alternative source of revenue, domestic manufacturers will more
readily be able to sustain a distribution system that exceeds
market demand, and foreign manufacturers will gain improved
market representation of their products.

Regulatory and Certification Issues. Through the public
statements of many high- ranking officials, it is clear that the
Japanese Government now recognizes that over- regulation is
inhibiting the growth of the Japanese economy It has taken
widely publicized actions to make meaningful reductions in the
regulatory burden

The auto industry sector has been hampered by many regulations
which require extensive documentation and inspection, and yet,
after foreign-manufactured autos are brought into Japan, MOT
still requires additional inspection of every single vehicle at
the time of registration under the Type-Notification method of
certification A lower level method of certification known as the
Preferential Handling Procedure, although procedurally less
complex, also requires inspection of every single vehicle at the
time of registration

Only when high-volume sales are achieved can a manufacturer
justify a process used by the Japanese manufacturers that does
not require inspection of every vehicle. These procedures
clearly are inhibiting to new entrants, and a great deal of
simplification is required if low-volume market entry is to be
achieved successfully

In addition to certification issues, certain regulatory
requirements are unnecessarily burdensome. One example is a
catalytic converter overheat warning system that is required
only in Japan. This system is of marginal value and is redundant
with a broadly-based diagnostic system (OBD II) required in the
U S. Continuation of this requirement adds unnecessary burden
for both the manufacturers and Japanese consumers and ACCJ
recommends it be dropped.

Further, the unwillingness of MOT to accept U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) certification of emissions of U S.
vehicles, which are known to be within technical compliance,
adds unnecessary administrative burdens, costs and delays to
market entry for new products.

Deregulation of the Vehicle Registration System. Automobile
dealers in Japan are required to undertake a detailed
registration procedure at their local land offices for each
automobile they sell, whether it is a domestically-produced or a
foreign- manufactured model. The documents which need to be
obtained or prepared include the registration certificate of the
purchaser's seal, a garage certificate, the customer's residence
card, the mandatory insurance certificate, title transfer
documents, certificate that the vehicle has been inspected, a
power of attorney, a statement showing the vehicle
tax/acquisition tax has been paid, a similar statement showing
the weight tax has been paid, a document showing the
registration commission has been paid, and so on.

Access to Vehicle Owner Data. While MOT has expressed a
willingness to make certain vehicle owner information available
to foreign manufacturers through the Japan Automobile Importers
Association (JAIA), foreign manufacturers cannot conduct
meaningful market research unless they have open and timely
access to such information, not bound by arbitrary rules
regarding frequency and coordination with other manufacturers.

The willingness of foreign manufacturers to invest in the
development of products for the Japan market -- and their
ability to meet market requirements -- depends heavily on the
results of meaningful market research. What is now restricted
because of many arbitrary rules is the ability of foreign
manufacturers to develop competitive products, which in itself
restricts market access.

Purchase of U.S.-made Parts. The export of component parts from
Japan to support the rapid growth of vehicle assembly by
Japanese transplants in the U S. is a key factor in the
continuing automotive trade imbalance. Even when such parts are
purchased in the U.S., they often are from Japanese transplant
suppliers. This is reflected in the low U.S - Canada parts
content numbers reported under requirements of the U.S.
Automotive Labeling Act. Vehicles produced by transplants
average only 40-50% U S -Canada parts content. In contrast,
Chrysler, Ford and General Motors vehicles average 90%, 86% and
92% U.S.-Canada parts content respectively

The Japanese auto companies have shown great reluctance to
purchase component parts from traditional U S suppliers for
their transplant operations, and even more so for export to
Japan.

CHRONOLOGY x U.S. AUTO INDUSTRY IN JAPAN

1902 - 1920: Japanese entrepreneurs build prototypes, but no
vehicle production facilities established.

1905: Ford exports its first vehicles to Japan in a private
sale

1909: Ford begins selling imported cars in Japan.

1915: Yanase begins sale of Buick and Cadillac models in Japan
for General Motors.

1920: First Japanese company sets up production - Hakuyoosha
manufactures "Automo" car, producing only 250 units up to the
time of the Great Kanto Earthquake.

1923: Great Kanto Earthquake destroys most of Tokyo. After the
earthquake, the Japanese Government imports a large number of
vehicles and encourages foreign manufacturers to build cars in
Japan.

1925: Ford Motor Company of Japan established Ford acquires 9
acres at Koyasu, Yokohama and sets up a KD assembly operation.

1926: General Motors (Japan) Ltd. is established.

1927: Dodge Brothers begins sales of cars in Japan.

General Motors begins assembly of cars and light trucks in
Osaka.

Ford installs Asia's first automatic conveyor assembly line at
Koyasu, which allows car and truck production of 10,000 units
per year, making Ford the top auto producer in Japan.

1930: Chrysler cars assembled in Yokohama

Domestic production by Japanese manufacturers reaches 1,000
units per year, primarily trucks for military purposes

1933: Nissan starts production

Toyota begins as the Automobile Department of Toyoda Automatic
Loom Works

1935: Ford purchases 91 acres of reclaimed land at Tsurumi,
Yokohama, in order to develop a steel mill and fabricate
components for vehicles assembled at the Koyasu plant. However,
plans do not proceed because the Japanese Government does not
approve the permits needed.

After the Ford expansion is prevented, the Japanese Government
passes the Automotive Manufacturing Industries Law. The purpose
of the law is to protect the domestic auto industry, provide
favorable tax treatment and incentives for Japanese
manufacturers, and to impose restrictions on foreign
manufacturers. Besides prohibiting Ford's expansion, the law
also limited GM-Japan production to less than 10,000 units per
year. Nissan and Toyota are the only Japanese manufacturers
authorized to build vehicles.

1949: GHQ lifts restrictions on passenger car production

Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law enacted This law
required any citizen who acquired foreign exchange through trade
to relinquish it to a government account. MITI administered the
law, so it was possible for the agency to allocate capital to
industries it considered to be most important to Japan's economy
The system was removed in 1964, but then replaced by a quota
system which lasted into the late 1970s.

Chrysler re-enters Japan, represented by independent
importers/dealers.

GM establishes a local sales office in Japan.

1950: Limited sales of imports allowed for specific
applications (taxis, etc.)

1951: Japanese Government regains sovereignty and states that
no foreign assemblers may enter Japan without six-year
manufactunng plans. Lack of clear policy on the treatment of
royalties and lack of guarantee beyond six years discourages
Ford from rene+ving activities in Japan

1952: G H Q lifts its import restrictions.

Occupation officially ends on April 28.

Japan announces first round of capital liberalization measures
as a result of accession to the OECD. Auto industry is not
included. Government of Japan announces regulations that limit
foreign ownership to no more than 7% of the stock of any
existing Japanese company, among other restrictions.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Trowbridge calls for specific, high
level negotiations to liberalize import and investment
restrictions in the automotive sector, in light of Japan's
emergence as the world's second largest producer of vehicles.
Although Japan agrees to talks in December after much
negotiation, at the last minute they announce that the head of
JAMA will lead the talks, with Japanese Government officials
acting only as observers, thus removing the Japanese Government
from being in a position to directly answer U S Government
demands. No substantive action results from the talks

1968: Japan refuses Borg Warner entry to Japan as a major
investor Borg Warner is only allowed minority investor access
and forced to release its patents to Japanese competitors

changes in automotive import and investment policies,
effective October 1971 Policy changed to increase engine
imports on a limited basis and to allow up to 50 percent
ownership bv foreign investors, but investment applications
must be approved by MITI MlTI lets it be known that, in
reality, it could accept foreign interest of only up to 35
percent, on the condition that remaining shares be held by
"stable stockholders." Chrysler joins with Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries to form Mitsubishi Motors Corporation. MITI accepts
35 percent ownership by Chrysler, but only after a 3-year
phase-in period beginning in 1971 with 15% allowed in the
first year, an additional 10% the second year, and the final
10% in the third year. Toyota advises the government that
acceptance of foreign capital within the Japanese auto
industry must be stopped

1971: GM adds dealers in Japan.

U.S.-JAPAN AUTOMOTIVE FACT SHEET

Bilateral Automotive Trade Results

The 1994 U.S.-Japan automotive (motor vehicles and parts) trade
deficit hit a record high $36.8 billion, up 10.2 percent from
1993 (See Chart 1) The primary reasons for this deterioration
are:

* Automotive imports from Japan jumped 13 percent from 1993,
reaching an all-time high of $40.3 billion.

* Despite growing 54 percent from 1993 to 1994 U.S. exports
of motor vehicles and parts to Japan still totaled an
insignificant $3.5 billion.

The 1994 bilateral automotive trade deficit accounted for 56
percent of the $66 billion total U.S.-Japan merchandise trade
deficit. (See Chart 2)

Motor Vehicle Trade Results

The 1994 bilateral motor vehicle deficit grew to $23.9 billion,
its highest level since 1987.

(See Chart 3)

* 1994 U.S. motor vehicle imports jumped 11.3 percent from
1993 to total $26 billion, the highest level since 1987's $26.1
billion. New passenger vehicle imports from Japan increased by
11 percent in 1994 to a record $24.3 billion. New truck imports
also increased by 16 percent to $1.7 billion.

* Total motor vehicle exports to Japan in 1994 equaled just
over $2 billion, up 75 percent from 1993. New passenger vehicle
exports to Japan jumped by 76 percent in 1994 to $1.8 billion,
compared to $1 billion in 1993 and $675 million in 1990. New
truck exports jumped 1,000 percent in 1994 to $33 million.

In unit terms, total motor vehicle imports climbed slightly to
1.8 million units, while exports reached a record 119,000 units.

* Imports of new passenger vehicles from Japan totaled 1.6
million.

* New truck imports from Japan were up 10.4 percent in 1994,
at 170,000 units.

* Of the 119,000 U.S. vehicles exported to Japan, 103,000
were cars and 2000 were trucks.

The motor vehicle deficit represented nearly 37 percent of the
total bilateral deficit.

Automotive Parts Trade: Results

The U.S.- Japan automotive parts trade deficit reached a record
S12 8 billion. deteriorating 15 percent from 1993's $11.2
billion imbalance (See Chart 4)

* U.S. automotive parts imports from Japan reached a record $14
3 billion. rising 16 percent from 1993's $12.3 billion and
accounting for almost one third of total 1994 U S automotive
parts imports

* 1994, U.S. automotive parts exports to Japan jumped 31
percent from 1993, but still totaled a relatively mea+,er $1.5
billion and accounted for only 1.4 percent of the $106.6 billion
Japanese automotive parts market.

* In 1994, U.S.- Japan automotive parts trade accounted for
about 20 percent of the estimated $66 billion total U.S - Japan
merchandise trade deficit, up from 19 percent in 1993.

* Excluding the $12.8 billion deficit with Japan, the United
States would register a $5.1 billion surplus in automotive parts
with the rest of the world.

Comparative Market Sizes and Import Penetration Levels

Motor Vehicles

The U.S. motor vehicle market comprises slightly over 15 million
units, of which 14 percent is supplied by imports. In
comparison, foreign imports account for just 4 percent of
Japarl's 6.5 million unit motor vehicle market. (See Chart 5)

* The United States has a 1.5 percent import share of the
Japanese motor vehicle market, while Japan has a 24 percent
share of the U.S. market (including imported and transplant
-built vehicles).

Automotive Parts The U.S. automotive parts market -- the world's
largest -- totals an estimated $122 billion, with imports
accounting for 37 percent. However, the import share of the $107
billion Japanese automotive parts market -- the world's second
largest -- totals a relatively meager 2.4 percent (See Chart 6)

* The United States has less than a 2 percent share of the
Japanese automotive parts market. The Japanese have an estimated
18 percent of the U.S. market, of which 12 percent is supplied
by imports and 6 percent by U.S.-based Japanese parts
manufacturers.

* At 2.4 percent, total foreign import penetration of the
Japanese automotive parts market is by far the lowest of the
major automotive parts market, whose import penetration levels
range from 16 to 60 percent.

The U.S. automotive parts afterrnarket totals approximately $49
billion, of which roughlv 18 percent was supplied by imports. In
comparison imports comprised only 3 percent of the estimated $27
billion Japanese automotive parts aftermarket.

* Total foreign import penetration of the Japanese parts
afterrnarket also lags far behind that of the other major
automotive afterrnarkets.

Japanese Purchases of U.S. Automotive Parts

Japanese purchases of U.S. automotive parts have grown from $2.5
billion in JFY 1986 to $15.5 billion in JFY 1993. For the first
half of JFY 1994, purchases were $9.5 billion. Full-year J+;Y
1994 purchases are expected to reach $20 billion, exceeding
Japan's 1992 pledge of $19 billion in parts purchases in FY 94.
(See Chart 7)

The majority of these parts purchases have supplied the
burgeoning production of Japanese vehicles in the United States.

NUTSHELL FACT SHEET U.S. - Japan Negotiations on Autos and Auto
Parts April 14, 1995

What are the talks about?

The talks currently undelway involve three areas -- automobiles
themselves, original equipment or original parts installed at
the factory, and the aftermarket, or secondary market, for
replacement parts. The United States is seeking fair access to
the Japanese market for its products in these three areas. We'll
explain more about our concerns in each area below

We are also asking Japanese companies in the United States and
Japan to renew their voluntaIy plans for expanding the use of
U.S. auto parts.

In general, can you explain the problem?

For many years the automotive sector has accounted for the
largest share of the trade imbalance between the U.S. and Japan.
In 1994 this imbalance was nearly $37 billion, or 56+o, of our
total trade deficit with Japan.

Several factors are at work here. First, Japan has increased its
exports of component parts to support its growing transplant
assembly operations in the U.S., and U.S.-based automotive
suppliers have been excluded from fair competition with
entrenched Japanese suppliers, even though the U.S. suppliers
of+er high quality and very competitive pricing.

Second, higher-value vehicles have been imported from Japan to
the United States.

Third, and in marked contrast, while the share of the U.S.
market held by Japanese auto makers is 22.5%, the share of the
Japanese market held by the Big Three is less than 1%.

An independent study released about a year ago, known as the
MOSS Motor Vehicle Study, reaffirmed that access to the Japanese
market was highly restricted. It also identified a level of
demand among the Japanese public for imported vehicles
significantly higher than present sales levels.

And Fourth, Japanese government regulations prevent foreign
firms from developing any significant business in the auto parts
replacement market in Japan.

Why is this so important to the United States? We have many
competitive industries.

Motor vehicle and equipment manufacturing is the largest of all
our manufacturing industries, and a the comerstone of our
nation's industrial base. No other industry has a bigger impact
on America's economy. Car and truck sales have averaged 4.4% of
our nation's Gross Domestic Product over the past three decades.

The Big Three -- Chrysler, Ford and General Motors -- with total
U.S. employment of 696,000 and a payroll of $31 billion, are the
nation's largest manufacturing industry.

With about 90% of the content of our vehicles obtained from the
U.S. and Canada, America's car companies also have a very large
multiplier effect on employment throughout the auto-supply
industry. Together with suppliers and dealers, they employ more
than 2.3 million Americans in more than 4,000 facilities and
18,000 dealerships across the countrv

Our auto companies are essential to the nation's manufacturing
infrastructure and many of its most basic and strategic
industrial sectors. The Big Three purchase large proportions of
our total output of natural and synthetic rubber, machine tools,
glass, semiconductors, aluminum, iron and steel. Over the past
five years, they have invested more than $73 billion in plants,
equipment and workforce training. Since l990, they have spent
more than $44 billion on research and development, and are among
the largest employers of research engineers and scientists.

Going back to the talks. Let's start with vehicles. How do we
see the problem and what are we asking the Japanese to do about
it?

The global auto industry has experienced revolutionary change
over the past decade - all the world's major auto makers are now
in tight competition: in offering new products, in quality,
performance, price, and so on.

Our market is the most open in the world. The European auto
market is beginning to open also, and the same holds true of the
Eastern bloc, Mexico, and Latin America.

While Japanese companies have gained the most from the opening
of the world's markets over past decade, the Japanese market
remains closed. Compare Japan to the rest of the industrial
world: imports into the US market are over 30%, and that number
reaches the 35%-59% range in the other G-7 countries. But
vehicle imports into Japan from every country in the world
lastyear totaled only 4.6%.

If a meaningful agreement can be achieved, and access to high
quality dealer outlets is significantly increased, Chrysler,
Ford, and GM expect to sell a minimum 200,000 autos and trucks
in Japan by 1998 -- compared to about 40,000 in 1994. And, the
overal+ import share could rise to 10+G of Japan's market over
the medium term

What about the second area of concern -- original equipment, or
parts installed at the factory?

The quality of Japanese vehicles made in the U.S. is a testament
to the quality and competitiveness of U.S. parts -- many of
which are contained in these vehicles.

But the export of component parts from Japan to support the
rapid growth of vehicle assembly by these transplants in the
U.S. remains a key factor in the continuing automotive trade
imbalance.

Japanese companies' longstanding reluctance to deal with foreign
suppliers of original parts at home or in their U.S. operations
has made progress very slow -- access to Japanese auto makers
remains exceedingly restricted for many foreign companies.

Voluntary purchasing plans have provided a valuable tool, and
have demonstrated that bringing US-made parts into the Japanese
auto manufacturing system can be accomplished while maintaining
the highest quality and tight cost standards.

The Japanese have inaccurately interpreted voluntary plans as
"obligations" or "commitments" by Japan's automakers. This does
not serve a constructive purpose. In fact, the Japanese
companies have agreed to such arrangements at their European
transplants.

And the third area, the aftermarket for parts?

The Japanese government heavily regulates the market for
automotive service and repair. Repair regulations in Japan
combine to extend the Ministry of Transportation's reach well
beyond ensuring compliance with safety and environmental
standards.

Many governments maintain vehicle inspection systems, including
our states, to ensure safety standards are met. However, the
government of Japan has taken its vehicle inspection and quality
assurance system -- the "shaken" -- to lengths that result not
only in excessively high costs to consumers, but in impenetrable
barriers to foreign exports and a virtual "authorized monopoly"
for certain dealers and garages in Japan. Ties to Japanese auto
manufacturers ensure that these repairs do not use parts made by
their competitors.

At 2.6%, foreign import penetration of the Japanese aftermarket
lags far behind that of the other major autornotive
aftermarkets. Imports represent 21.8% and 17.5% of the EU and
U.S. aftermarkets, respectively.

A final note.

Innovation and competitiveness do not belong to any one nation,
as the recovery of the U.S. auto industry and the rapid
appreciation of the yen amply demonstrate. Japan's long-term
competitiveness and economic success, and incidentally, relief
from constant disputes with its trading partners, lies in the
further internationalization of its domestic economy.

IMPACT OF AMERICA'S CAR COMPANIES ON THE U.S. ECONOMY

The resurgence of America's car companies is good economic news
for the nation. Motor vehicle and equipment manufacturing is the
largest of all manufacturing industries, and is the cornerstone
of our nation's industrial base. No other industry has a bigger
impact on America's economy. Car and truck sales have averaged
4.4% of our nation's Gross Domestic Product over the past three
decades.

Chrysler, Ford and General Motors, with total U.S. employment of
696,000 and a total payroll of $31 billion, are the nation's
largest manufacturing employer. With about 90% of the content of
our vehicles obtained from the U.S. and Canada, America's car
companies also have a very large multiplier effect on employment
throughout the auto-supply industry. In fact, Chrysler, Ford and
General Motors support 19 out of every 20 jobs related to the
production of cars and trucks in the United States. Together
with suppliers and dealers, they employ more than 2.3 million
Americans in more than 4,000 facilities and 18,000 dealerships
across the country.

America's car companies are also essential to the nation's
manufacturing infrastructure and many of its most basic and
strategic industrial sectors. Chrysler, Ford and General Motors
purchase large proportions of the nation's total output of
natural and synthetic rubber, machine tools, glass,
semiconductors, aluminum, iron and steel. Over the past five
years, they have invested more than $73 million in plants,
equipment and workforce training. Since 1990, they have spent
more than $44 billion on research and development, and are among
the largest employers of research engineers and scientists.

America's car companies are rapidly expanding exports to help
America compete in the global marketplace and to restore a
favorable trade balance. In just the last three years, our
exports increased by 40%, and we expect continued rapid growth
in exports of both vehicles and components as we introduce an
impressive line-up of right-hand-drive vehicles, and the
technical, marketing and service support needed to penetrate
foreign markets.

America's car companies are the nation's number one customer of
small business and have contributed significantly to the growth
and rising employment in this important sector of the economy.
They are also one of the nation's leading employers of
minorities and one of the largest customers for minority-owned
small businesses throughout America. The hundreds of millions of
dollars they pay in local, state and federal taxes and make in
philanthropic contributions help meet our nation's educational,
social and cultural need+

EXAMPLES OF PROBLEMS IN JAPAN'S AUTO MARKET AND AUTO PARTS
AFTERMARKET

Japan's motor vehicle inspection and repair requirements
restrict foreign access to the Japanese market by excessively
regulating well beyond any reasonable safety needs.

Simply by purchasing front brush guards and adding them to an RV
vehicle (adding considerable safety by providing stronger
resistance on impact) requires complete reinspection that may
cost up to $3000.

Potential aftermarket auto parts customers call U.S. suppliers
and ask if desired modifications require inspection. If they do,
60-70% of the customers immediately lose interest. Because of
this, in some cases, vehicle owners will have illegal
modifications done sometimes leading to unsafe conditions.

Following are additional problems as reported by U.S.
businesses:

* Replacing springs and shocks requires reinspection when it
lowers or raises the vehicle by more than 1 centimeter. In order
to pass annual inspection without this change being noticed,
vehicle owners will add roof racks so that the overall height is
not changed and then remove the racks after inspection.

* The MOT restrictions on replacing critical parts severely
limit the sale of brake pads, brake rotors, bearings, bushings,
rubber parts, shock absorbers, etc. According to one U.S.
businessman, certified shops "look on non-Original Equipment
(OE) parts as outcasts and won't even talk to potential
suppliers". Typically, these cerfi+ed garages are controlled by
Japanese auto companies and stock only Japanese auto par+s. The
U.S. has been accused by the Japanese Government of trying to
weaken Japanese vehicle safety regulations by requesting that
certified garages no longer be required. At no time has the U.S.
requested changes from the Japanese that would make their
vehicles less safe.

* Even adding specially illuminated license plates, which are
popular in Japan, can make the plates as much as 4 centimeters
thicker. In many models of vehicles, this will extend the length
of the vehicle past the 1 centimeter change limit that requires
inspection. This kind of inspection can cost between $500-$600 -
just to add license plate lighting!

* Adding special wider wheels to a vehicle requires reinspection
because it changes the +,vidth of the car by more than one
centimeter.

* When adding a trailer hitch to a car, MOT requires that both
the hitch and the trailer be brought in for inspection. This is
extremely inconvenient and costly. Hitches must pass a series of
requirements for strength and pull weight. The rapid growth in
the leisure market including jet skiing+ camping, and a variety
of new sports has created great potential demand for these hitches,
but MOT regulations have constrained the market. As a result,
many users are attaching special hitches that swing into place
and get around the regulations because they do not change the
dimensions of the vehicle. However, the hitches are considerably
less secure than normal hitches.

* MOT does not recognize US vehicle identification numbers.
Instead it requires a new number, with the date of import, be
added to all vehicles upon entry to the country. MOT also
verifies, during regular inspection that certain critical parts
are the correct model year for the car. Here, imports face a
special problem because the inspectors go by the year of the
import vehicle identification number - which may be a different
year than the actual model of the car. In these cases, US cars
have faced rejection during inspection.

* Some parts require highly stringent inspection tests. US
mufflers have encountered problems passing the series of five
tests that are required under MOT regulations. Part of this is
because inspection stations can be very inconsistent and will
end up passing vehicles with parts from garages with which they
already have a "cozy" established relationship. This adds up to
discrimination against imports.

undertake immediate efforts to develop effective multilateral
responses to international terrorism as a complement to
national counterterrorist efforts;

covert action and military force, to disrupt, dismantle, and
destroy international infrastructure used by international

international sanctions on state sponsors of terrorism,

Committee to allow airline flights to and from Libya despite

  `(2) an alien terrorist is physically present in the United
States; and
  `(3) removal of such alien terrorist by deportation
proceedings described in sections 242, 242A, or 242B would pose
a risk to the national security of the United States because
such proceedings would disclose classified information.
   `(b) Custody and Release Pending Hearing: (1) The Attorney
 General may take into custody any alien with respect to whom a
 certification has been made under subsection (a), and
 notwithstanding any other provision of law, may retain such alien

 in custody in accordance with this subsection.

 the special court designated pursuant to subsection (c).

United
 States judicial districts to hear and decide cases arising under

 Surveillance Act (50 U.S.C. 1803(a)).

Attorney
 General makes the application described in subsection (a), a
single
 judge of the special court shall consider the application in

 the judge determines that there is probable cause to believe
that--
  `(A) the alien who is the subject of the application has been
correctly identified and is an alien as described in section
241(a)(4)(B); and
  `(B) a deportation proceeding described in section 242, 242A,
or 242B would pose a risk to the national security of the
United States because such proceedings would disclose
classified information.
   `(e) Special Removal Hearing: (1) Except as provided in
paragraph
 (5), the special removal hearing authorized by a showing of
 probable cause described in subsection (d)(2) shall be open to
the
 public.

 witness or request that the judge issue a subpoena for the
presence
 of a named witness.
   `(4)(A) An alien subject to removal under this section shall
have
 no right--
  `(i) of discovery of information derived from electronic
surveillance authorized under the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 801 et seq.) or otherwise
for national security purposes if disclosure would present a
risk to the national security; or

to
 subsections 106 (c), (e), (f), (g), and (h) of such Act.
   `(C) Section 3504 of title 18, United States Code, shall not
 apply to procedures under this section if the Attorney General
 determines that public disclosure would pose a risk to the
national
 security of the United States because it would disclose
classified
 information.
   `(5) The judge shall authorize the introduction in camera and
ex
 parte of any evidence for which the Attorney General determines
 that public disclosure would pose a risk to the national security

 of the United States because it would disclose classified
 information. With respect to such evidence, the Attorney General
 shall submit to the court an unclassified summary of the specific
 evidence prepared in accordance with paragraph (6).
   `(6)(A) The information submitted under paragraph (5)(B) shall
 contain an unclassified summary of the classified information
that
 does not pose a risk to national security.
   `(B) The judge shall approve the summary within 15 days of
 submission if the judge finds that it is sufficient to inform the
 alien of the nature of the evidence that such person is an alien
as
 described in section 241(a), and to provide the alien with
 substantially the same ability to make his defense as would
 disclosure of the classified information.
   `(C) The Attorney General shall cause to be delivered to the
 alien a copy of the unclassified summary approved under
 subparagraph (B).
   `(D) If the written unclassified summary is not approved by the
 court pursuant to subparagraph (B), the Department of Justice
shall
 be afforded 15 days to correct the deficiencies identified by the
 court and submit a revised unclassified summary.
   `(E) If the revised unclassified summary is not approved by the
 court within 15 days of its submission pursuant to subparagraph
 (B), the special removal hearing shall be terminated unless the
 court, within that time, after reviewing the classified
information
 in camera and ex parte, issues written findings that--
  `(i) the alien's continued presence in the United States
would likely cause--
  `(I) serious and irreparable harm to the national
security; or
  `(II) death or serious bodily injury to any person; and
  `(ii) provision of either the classified information or an
unclassified summary that meets the standard set forth in
subparagraph (B) would likely cause--
  `(I) serious and irreparable harm to the national
security; or
  `(II) death or serious bodily injury to any person; and
  `(iii) the unclassified summary prepared by the Justice
Department is adequate to allow the alien to prepare a defense.
   `(F) If the court issues such findings, the special removal
 proceeding shall continue, and the Attorney General shall cause
to
 be delivered to the alien within 15 days of the issuance of such
 findings a copy of the unclassified summary together with a
 statement that it meets the standard set forth in subparagraph
 (E)(iii).
   `(G)(i) Within 10 days of filing of the appealable order the
 Department of Justice may take an interlocutory appeal to the
 United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit
 of--
  `(I) any determination made by the judge concerning the
requirements set forth in subparagraph (B).
  `(II) any determination made by the judge concerning the
requirements set forth in subparagraph (E).
   `(ii) In an interlocutory appeal taken under this paragraph,
the
 entire record, including any proposed order of the judge or
summary
 of evidence, shall be transmitted to the Court of Appeals under
 seal, and the matter shall be heard ex parte. The Court of
Appeals
 shall consider the appeal as expeditiously as possible, but no
 later than 30 days after filing of the appeal.
   `(f) Determination of Deportation: The judge shall, considering
 the evidence on the record as a whole (in camera and otherwise),
 require that the alien be deported if the Attorney General
proves,
 by clear and convincing evidence, that the alien is subject to
 deportation because such alien is an alien as described in
section
 241(a)(4)(B). If the judge finds that the Department of Justice
has
 met this burden, the judge shall order the alien removed and, if
 the alien was released pending the special removal proceeding,
 order the Attorney General to take the alien into custody.
   `(g) Appeals: (1) The alien may appeal a final determination
 under subsection (f) to the United States Court of Appeals for
the
 District of Columbia Circuit, by filing a notice of appeal with
 such court not later than 30 days after the determination is
made.
 An appeal under this section shall be heard by the Court of
Appeals
 sitting en banc.
   `(2) The Attorney General may appeal a determination under
 subsection (d), (e), or (f) to the Court of Appeals for the
 District of Columbia Circuit, by filing a notice of appeal with
 such court not later than 20 days after the determination is made
 under any one of such subsections.
   `(3) If the Department of Justice does not seek review, the
alien
 shall be released from custody, unless such alien may be arrested
 and taken into custody pursuant to title II as an alien subject
to
 deportation, in which case such alien shall be treated in
 accordance with the provisions of this Act concerning the
 deportation of aliens.
   `(4) If the application for the order is denied because the
judge
 has not found probable cause to believe that the alien who is the
 subject of the application has been correctly identified or is an
 alien as described in paragraph 4(B) of section 241(a), and the
 Department of Justice seeks review, the alien shall be released
 from custody unless such alien may be arrested and taken into
 custody pursuant to title II as an alien subject to deportation,
in
 which case such alien shall be treated in accordance with the
 provisions of this Act concerning the deportation of aliens
 simultaneously with the application of this title.
   `(5)(A) If the application for the order is denied based on a
 finding that no probable cause exists to find that adherence to
the
 provisions of title II regarding the deportation of the
identified
 alien would pose a risk of irreparable harm to the national
 security of the United States, or death or serious bodily injury
to
 any person, the judge shall release the alien from custody
subject
 to the least restrictive condition or combination of conditions
of
 release described in section 3142(b) and (c)(1)(B) (i) through
 (xiv) of title 18, United States Code, that will reasonably
ensure
 the appearance of the alien at any future proceeding pursuant to
 this title and will not endanger the safety of any other person
or
 the Community.
   `(B) The alien shall remain in custody if the court fails to
make
 a finding under subparagraph (A), until the completion of any
 appeal authorized by this title. Sections 3145 through 3148 of
 title 18, United States Code, pertaining to review and appeal of
a
 release or detention order, penalties for failure to appear,
 penalties for an offense committed while on release, and
sanctions
 for violation of a release condition, shall apply to an alien to
 whom the previous sentence applies and--
  `(i) for purposes of section 3145 of such title, an appeal
shall be taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit; and
  `(ii) for purposes of section 3146 of such title the alien
shall be considered released in connection with a charge of an
offense punishable by life imprisonment.
   `(6) When requested by the Attorney General, the entire record
of
 the proceeding under this section shall be transmitted to the
court
 of appeals or the Supreme Court under seal. The court of appeals
or
 Supreme Court may consider such appeal in camera.'.

  TITLE IV--CONTROL OF FUNDRAISING FOR TERRORISM ACTIVITIES
 SEC. 401. PROHIBITION ON TERRORIST FUNDRAISING.
   (a) In General: Chapter 113B of title 18, United States Code,
is
 amended by adding at the end the following new section:
 `Sec. 2339B. Fundraising for terrorist organizations
   `(a) Findings and Purpose:
  `(1) The Congress finds that--
  `(A) terrorism is a serious and deadly problem which
threatens the interests of the United States overseas and
within our territory;
  `(B) the Nation's security interests are gravely affected
by the terrorist attacks carried out overseas against
United States Government facilities and officials, and
against American citizens present in foreign countries;
  `(C) United States foreign policy and economic interests
are profoundly affected by terrorist acts overseas directed
against foreign governments and their people;
  `(D) international cooperation is required for an
effective response to terrorism, as demonstrated by the
numerous multilateral conventions in force providing
universal prosecutive jurisdiction over persons involved in
a variety of terrorist acts, including hostage taking,
murder of an internationally protected person, and aircraft
piracy and sabotage;
  `(E) some foreign terrorist organizations, acting through
affiliated groups or individuals, raise significant funds
within the United States or use the United States as a
conduit for the receipt of funds raised in other nations; and
  `(F) the provision of funds to organizations that engage
in terrorism serves to facilitate their terrorist
endeavors, regardless of whether the funds, in whole or in
part, are intended or claimed to be used for nonviolent
purposes.
  `(2) The purpose of this section is to provide the Federal
Government the fullest possible basis, consistent with the
Constitution, to prevent persons within the United States or
subject to the jurisdiction of the United States from providing
funds, directly or indirectly, to foreign organizations,
including subordinate or affiliated persons, that engage in
terrorism activities.
   `(b) Designation:
  `(1) The Secretary of State, after consultation with the
Secretary of the Treasury, is authorized to designate under
this section any foreign organization based on finding that--
  `(A) the organization engages in terrorism activity as
defined in section 212(a)(3)(B) of the Immigration and
Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)); and
  `(B) the organization's terrorism activities threaten the
security of United States citizens, national security,
foreign policy, or the economy of the United States.
  `(2) Not later than 7 days after making a designation under
paragraph (1), the Secretary of State shall prepare and
transmit to Congress a report containing a list of the
designated organizations and a summary of the facts underlying
the designation. The designation shall take effect 30 days
after the receipt of actual notice under subsection (b)(6),
unless otherwise provided by law.
  `(3) A designation or redesignation under this subsection
shall be in effect for 1 year following its effective date,
unless revoked under paragraph (4).
  `(4)(A) If the Secretary of State, after consultation with
the Secretary of the Treasury, finds that the conditions that
were the basis for any designation issued under this subsection
have changed in such a manner as to warrant revocation of such
designation, or that the national security, foreign relations,
or economic interests of the United States so warrant, the
Secretary of State may revoke such designation in whole or in
part.
  `(B) Not later than 7 calendar days after the Secretary of
State finds that an organization no longer engages in, or
supports, terrorism activity, the Secretary of State shall
prepare and transmit to Congress a supplemental report stating
the reasons for the finding.
  `(5) Any designation, or revocation of a designation, issued
under this subsection shall be published in the Federal
Register not later than 7 calendar days after the Secretary of
State makes the designation.
  `(6) Not later than 7 calendar days after making a
designation under this subsection, the Secretary of State shall
give the organization actual notice of--
  `(A) the designation;
  `(B) the consequences of the designation for the
organization's ability to raise funds in the United States;
and
  `(C) the availability of judicial review.
  `(7) Any revocation or lapsing of a designation shall not
affect any action or proceeding based on any conduct committed
prior to the effective date of such revocation or lapsing.
  `(8) Classified information may be used in making a
designation under this subsection. Such information shall not
be disclosed to the public or to any party, but may be
disclosed to a court ex parte and in camera.
  `(9) No question concerning the validity of the issuance of a
designation issued under this subsection may be raised by a
defendant in a criminal prosecution as a defense in or as an
objection to any trial or hearing if such designation was
issued and published in the Federal Register.
   `(c) Judicial Review:
  `(1) Organizations designated by the Secretary of State as
engaging in, or supporting, terrorism activities under this
section may seek review of the designation in the District
Court for the District of Columbia not later than 30 days after
receipt of actual notice under subsection (b)(6).
  `(2) In reviewing a designation under this subsection, the
court shall receive relevant oral or documentary evidence,
unless the court finds that the probative value is
substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,
confusion of the issues, or considerations of undue delay,
waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence,
or unless its introduction or consideration is prohibited by a
common law privilege or by the Constitution or laws of the
United States. A party shall be entitled to present its case or
defense by oral or documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal
evidence, and to conduct such cross-examination as may be
required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.
  `(3) The judge shall authorize the introduction in camera and
ex parte of any item of evidence containing classified
information for which the Attorney General determines that
public disclosure would pose a risk to the national security of
the United States. With respect to such evidence, the Attorney
General shall submit to the court either--
  `(A) a statement identifying relevant facts that the
specific evidence would tend to prove; or
  `(B) an unclassified summary of the specific evidence
prepared in accordance with paragraph (5).
  `(4)(A)(i) The Secretary of State shall have the burden of
demonstrating that there are specific and articulable facts
giving reason to believe that the organization engages in or
supports terrorism activity (as that term is defined in section
212(a)(3)(B)).
  `(ii) The organization shall have the burden of proving that
its purpose is to engage in religious, charitable, literary,
educational, or nonterrorism activities and that it engages in
such activities.
  `(iii) The Secretary shall have the burden of proving that
the control group of the organization has actual knowledge that
the organization or its resources are being used for terrorism
activities.
  `(iv) If any portion of the Secretary's evidence consists of
classified information that cannot be revealed to the
organization for national security reasons, the Secretary must
prove these elements by clear and convincing evidence.
  `(B) If the court finds, under the standards stated in
subparagraph (A) that the control group of the organization has
actual knowledge that the organization or its resources are
being used for terrorism activities, the court shall affirm the
designation of the Secretary.
  `(C)(i) If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence
that the organization or its resources have been used for
terrorism activities without the knowledge of the control
group, but that the control group is now aware of these facts,
the court may condition revocation of the designation on the
control group's undertaking or completing all steps within its
power to prevent the organization or its resources from being
used for terrorism activities. Such steps may include--
  `(I) maintaining financial records adequate to document
the use of the organization's resources; and
  `(II) making records available to the Secretary for
inspection.
  `(ii) If a designation is revoked under subsection (B)(4) and
the organization fails to comply with any condition imposed,
the designation may be reinstated by the Secretary of State
upon a showing that the organization failed to comply with the
condition.
   `(5)(A) The information submitted under paragraph (3)(B) shall
 contain an unclassified summary of the classified information
that
 does not pose a risk to national security.
   `(B) The judge shall approve the unclassified summary if the
 judge finds that the summary is sufficient to inform the
 organization of the activities described in section 212(a)(3)(B)
in
 which the organization is alleged to engage, and to permit the
 organization to defend against the designation.
   `(C) The Attorney General shall cause to be delivered to the
 organization a copy of the unclassified summary approved under
 subparagraph (B).
   `(6) The court shall decide the case on the basis of the
evidence
 on the record as a whole, in camera or otherwise.
   `(d) Prohibited Activities: It shall be unlawful for any person
 within the United States, or any person subject to the
jurisdiction
 of the United States anywhere, to directly or indirectly, raise,
 receive, or collect on behalf of, or furnish, give, transmit,
 transfer, or provide funds to or for an organization or person
 designated by the Secretary of State under subsection (b), or to
 attempt to do any of the foregoing.
   `(e) Special Requirements for Financial Institutions:
  `(1) Except as authorized by the Secretary of State, after
consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, by means of
directives, regulations, or licenses, any financial institution
that becomes aware that it has possession of or control over
any funds in which an organization or person designated under
subsection (b) has an interest, shall--
  `(A) retain possession of or maintain control over such
funds; and
  `(B) report to the Secretary the existence of such funds
in accordance with the regulations prescribed by the
Secretary.
  `(2) Any financial institution that knowingly fails to report
to the Secretary the existence of such funds shall be subject
to a civil penalty of $250 per day for each day that it fails
to report to the Secretary--
  `(A) in the case of funds being possessed or controlled
at the time of the designation of the organization or
person, within 10 days after the designation; and
  `(B) in the case of funds whose possession of or control
over arose after the designation of the organization or
person, within 10 days after the financial institution
obtained possession of or control over the funds.
   `(f) Investigations: Any investigation emanating from a
possible
 violation of this section shall be conducted by the Attorney
 General, except that investigations relating to--
  `(1) a financial institution's compliance with the
requirements of subsection (e); and
  `(2) civil penalty proceedings authorized pursuant to
subsection (g)(2),
 shall be conducted in coordination with the Attorney General by
the
 office within the Department of the Treasury responsible for
civil
 penalty proceedings authorized by this section. Any evidence of a
 criminal violation of this section arising in the course of an
 investigation by the Secretary or any other Federal agency shall
be
 referred immediately to the Attorney General for further
 investigation. The Attorney General shall timely notify the
 Secretary of any action taken on referrals from the Secretary,
and
 may refer investigations to the Secretary for remedial licensing
or
 civil penalty action.
   `(g) Penalties:
  `(1) Any person who, with knowledge that the donee is a
designated entity, violates subsection (d) shall be fined under
this title, or imprisoned for up to ten years, or both.
  `(2) Any financial institution that knowingly fails to comply
with subsection (e), or by regulations promulgated thereunder,
shall be subject to a civil penalty of $50,000 per violation,
or twice the amount of money of which the financial institution
was required to retain possession or control, whichever is
greater.
   `(h) Injunction:
  `(1) Whenever it appears to the Secretary or the Attorney
General that any person is engaged in, or is about to engage
in, any act which constitutes, or would constitute, a violation
of this section, the Attorney General may initiate civil action
in a district court of the United States to enjoin such
violation.
  `(2) A proceeding under this subsection is governed by the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, except that, if an indictment
has been returned against the respondent, discovery is governed
by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
   `(i) Extraterritorial Jurisdiction: There is extraterritorial
 Federal jurisdiction over an offense under this section.
   `(j) Classified Information in Civil Proceedings Brought by the
 United States:
  `(1) Discovery of classified information by defendants: A
court, upon a sufficient showing, may authorize the United
States to delete specified items of classified information from
documents to be introduced into evidence or made available to
the defendant through discovery under the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure, to substitute an unclassified summary of the
information for such classified documents, or to substitute a
statement admitting relevant facts that the classified
information would tend to prove. The court shall permit the
United States to make a request for such authorization in the
form of a written statement to be inspected by the court alone.
If the court enters an order granting relief following such an
ex parte showing, the entire text of the statement of the
United States shall be sealed and preserved in the records of
the court to be made available to the appellate court in the
event of an appeal. If the court enters an order denying relief
to the United States under this paragraph, the United States
may take an immediate, interlocutory appeal in accordance with
the provisions of paragraph (3). For purposes of such an
appeal, the entire text of the underlying written statement of
the United States, together with any transcripts of arguments
made ex parte to the court in connection therewith, shall be
maintained under seal and delivered to the appellate court.
  `(2) Introduction of classified information; precautions by
court:
  `(A) Exhibits: The United States, to prevent unnecessaryor
inadvertent disclosure of classified information in a
civil trial or other proceeding brought by the United
States under this section, may petition the court ex parte
to admit, in lieu of classified writings, recordings or
photographs, one or more of the following:
 `(i) copies of those items from which classified
information has been deleted;
 `(ii) stipulations admitting relevant facts that
specific classified information would tend to prove; or
 `(iii) an unclassified summary of the specific
classified information.
The court shall grant such a motion of the United States if
the court finds that the redacted item, stipulation, or
unclassified summary will provide the defendant with
substantially the same ability to make his defense as would
disclosure of the specific classified information.
  `(B) Taking of trial testimony: During the examination of
a witness in any civil proceeding brought by the United
States under this section, the United States may object to
any question or line of inquiry that may require the
witness to disclose classified information not previously
found to be admissible. Following such an objection, the
court shall take suitable action to determine whether the
response is admissible and, in doing so, shall take
precautions to guard against the compromise of any
classified information. Such action may include permitting
the United States to provide the court, ex parte, with a
proffer of the witness's response to the question or line
of inquiry, and requiring the defendant to provide the
court with a proffer of the nature of the information the
defendant seeks to elicit.
  `(C) Appeal: If the court enters an order denying relief
to the United States under this subsection, the United
States may take an immediate interlocutory appeal in
accordance with paragraph (3).
  `(3) Interlocutory appeal:
  `(A) An interlocutory appeal by the United States shall
lie to a court of appeals from a decision or order of a
district court--
 `(i) authorizing the disclosure of classified
information;
 `(ii) imposing sanctions for nondisclosure of
classified information; or
 `(iii) refusing a protective order sought by the
United States to prevent the disclosure of classified
information.
  `(B) An appeal taken pursuant to this paragraph either
before or during trial shall be expedited by the court of
appeals. Prior to trial, an appeal shall be taken not later
than 10 days after the decision or order appealed from, and
the trial shall not commence until the appeal is resolved.
If an appeal is taken during trial, the trial court shall
adjourn the trial until the appeal is resolved. The court
of appeals--
 `(i) shall hear argument on such appeal not later
than 4 days after the adjournment of the trial;
 `(ii) may dispense with written briefs other than the
supporting materials previously submitted to the trial
court;
 `(iii) shall render its decision not later than 4
days after argument on appeal; and
 `(iv) may dispense with the issuance of a written
opinion in rendering its decision.
  `(C) An interlocutory appeal and decision under this
paragraph shall not affect the right of the defendant, in a
subsequent appeal from a final judgment, to claim as error,
reversal by the trial court on remand of a ruling appealed
from during trial.
  `(4) Construction: Nothing in this subsection shall prevent
the United States from seeking protective orders or asserting
privileges ordinarily available to the United States to protect
against the disclosure of classified information, including the
invocation of the military and State secrets privilege.

 `Sec. 2261. Prisoners in State custody subject to capital
sentence;
 appointment of counsel; requirement of rule of court or statute;
 procedures for appointment
   `(a) This chapter shall apply to cases arising under section
2254
 brought by prisoners in State custody who are subject to a
capital
 sentence. It shall apply only if the provisions of subsections
(b)
 and (c) are satisfied.
   `(b) This chapter is applicable if a State establishes by
 statute, rule of its court of last resort, or by another agency
 authorized by State law, a mechanism for the appointment,
 compensation, and payment of reasonable litigation expenses of
 competent counsel in State post-conviction proceedings brought by
 indigent prisoners whose capital convictions and sentences have
 been upheld on direct appeal to the court of last resort in the
 State or have otherwise become final for State law purposes. The
 rule of court or statute must provide standards of competency for
 the appointment of such counsel.
   `(c) Any mechanism for the appointment, compensation, and
 reimbursement of counsel as provided in subsection (b) must offer
 counsel to all State prisoners under capital sentence and must
 provide for the entry of an order by a court of record--
  `(1) appointing one or more counsels to represent the
prisoner upon a finding that the prisoner is indigent and
accepted the offer or is unable competently to decide whether
to accept or reject the offer;
  `(2) finding, after a hearing if necessary, that the prisoner
rejected the offer of counsel and made the decision with an
understanding of its legal consequences; or
  `(3) denying the appointment of counsel upon a finding that
the prisoner is not indigent.
   `(d) No counsel appointed pursuant to subsections (b) and (c)
to
 represent a State prisoner under capital sentence shall have
 previously represented the prisoner at trial or on direct appeal
in
 the case for which the appointment is made unless the prisoner
and
 counsel expressly request continued representation.
   `(e) The ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during
State
 or Federal post-conviction proceedings in a capital case shall
not
 be a ground for relief in a proceeding arising under section
2254.
 This limitation shall not preclude the appointment of different
 counsel, on the court's own motion or at the request of the
 prisoner, at any phase of State or Federal post-conviction
 proceedings on the basis of the ineffectiveness or incompetence
of
 counsel in such proceedings.
 `Sec. 2262. Mandatory stay of execution; duration; limits on
stays
 of execution; successive petitions
   `(a) Upon the entry in the appropriate State court of record of

 an order under section 2261(c), a warrant or order setting an
 execution date for a State prisoner shall be stayed upon
 application to any court that would have jurisdiction over any
 proceedings filed under section 2254. The application shall
recite
 that the State has invoked the post-conviction review procedures
of
 this chapter and that the scheduled execution is subject to stay.
   `(b) A stay of execution granted pursuant to subsection (a)
shall
 expire if--
  `(1) a State prisoner fails to file a habeas corpus
application under section 2254 within the time required in
section 2263;
  `(2) before a court of competent jurisdiction, in the
presence of counsel, unless the prisoner has competently and
knowingly waived such counsel, and after having been advised of
the consequences, a State prisoner under capital sentence
waives the right to pursue habeas corpus review under section
2254; or
  `(3) a State prisoner files a habeas corpus petition under
section 2254 within the time required by section 2263 and fails
to make a substantial showing of the denial of a Federal right
or is denied relief in the district court or at any subsequent
stage of review.
   `(c) If one of the conditions in subsection (b) has occurred,
no
 Federal court thereafter shall have the authority to enter a stay

 of execution in the case, unless the court of appeals approves
the
 filing of a second or  successive application under section
2244(b).
 `Sec. 2263. Filing of habeas corpus application; time
requirements;
 tolling rules
   `(a) Any application under this chapter for habeas corpus
relief
 under section 2254 must be filed in the appropriate district
court
 not later than 180 days after final State court affirmance of the
 conviction and sentence on direct review or the expiration of the
 time for seeking such review.
   `(b) The time requirements established by subsection (a) shall
be
 tolled--
  `(1) from the date that a petition for certiorari is filed in
the Supreme Court until the date of final disposition of the
petition if a State prisoner files the petition to secure
review by the Supreme Court of the affirmance of a capital
sentence on direct review by the court of last resort of the
State or other final State court decision on direct review;
  `(2) from the date on which the first petition for
post-conviction review or other collateral relief is filed
until the final State court disposition of such petition; and
  `(3) during an additional period not to exceed 30 days, if--
  `(A) a motion for an extension of time is filed in the
Federal district court that would have jurisdiction over
the case upon the filing of a habeas corpus application
under section 2254; and
  `(B) a showing of good cause is made for the failure to
file the habeas corpus application within the time period
established by this section.
 `Sec. 2264. Scope of Federal review; district court adjudications
   `(a) Whenever a State prisoner under capital sentence files a
 petition for habeas corpus relief to which this chapter applies,
 the district court shall only consider a claim or claims that
have
 been raised and decided on the merits in the State courts, unless
 the failure to raise the claim properly is--
  `(1) the result of State action in violation of the
Constitution or laws of the United States;
  `(2) the result of the Supreme Court recognition of a new
Federal right that is made retroactively applicable; or
  `(3) based on a factual predicate that could not have been
discovered through the exercise of due diligence in time to
present the claim for State or Federal post-conviction review.
   `(b) Following review subject to subsections (a), (d), and (e)
of
 section 2254, the court shall rule on the claims properly before
it.
 `Sec. 2265. Application to State unitary review procedure
   `(a) For purposes of this section, a `unitary review' procedure
 means a State procedure that authorizes a person under sentence
of
 death to raise, in the course of direct review of the judgment,
 such claims as could be raised on collateral attack. This chapter
 shall apply, as provided in this section, in relation to a State
 unitary review procedure if the State establishes by rule of its
 court of last resort or by statute a mechanism for the
appointment,
 compensation, and payment of reasonable litigation expenses of
 competent counsel in the unitary review proceedings, including
 expenses relating to the litigation of collateral claims in the
 proceedings. The rule of court or statute must provide standards
of
 competency for the appointment of such counsel.
   `(b) To qualify under this section, a unitary review procedure
 must include an offer of counsel following trial for the purpose
of
 representation on unitary review, and entry of an order, as
 provided in section 2261(c), concerning appointment of counsel or
 waiver or denial of appointment of counsel for that purpose. No
 counsel appointed to represent the prisoner in the unitary review
 proceedings shall have previously represented the prisoner at
trial
 in the case for which the appointment is made unless the prisoner
 and counsel expressly request continued representation.
   `(c) Sections 2262, 2263, 2264, and 2266 shall apply in
relation
 to cases involving a sentence of death from any State having a
 unitary review procedure that qualifies under this section.
 References to State `post-conviction review' and `direct review'
in
 such sections shall be understood as referring to unitary review
 under the State procedure. The reference in section 2262(a) to
`an
 order under section 2261(c)' shall be understood as referring to
 the post-trial order under subsection (b) concerning
representation
 in the unitary review proceedings, but if a transcript of the
trial
 proceedings is unavailable at the time of the filing of such an
 order in the appropriate State court, then the start of the
180-day
 limitation period under section 2263 shall be deferred until a
 transcript is made available to the prisoner or counsel of the
 prisoner.
 `Sec. 2266. Limitation periods for determining applications and
 motions
   `(a) The adjudication of any application under section 2254
that
 is subject to this chapter, and the adjudication of any motion
 under section 2255 by a person under sentence of death, shall be
 given priority by the district court and by the court of appeals
 over all noncapital matters.
   `(b)(1)(A) A district court shall render a final determination
 and enter a final judgment on any application for a writ of
habeas
 corpus brought under this chapter in a capital case not later
than
 180 days after the date on which the application is filed.

days
 in which to complete all actions, including the preparation of
all
 pleadings and briefs, and if necessary, a hearing, prior to the
 submission of the case for decision.
   `(C)(i) A district court may delay for not more than one
 additional 30-day period beyond the period specified in
 subparagraph (A), the rendering of a determination of an
 application for a writ of habeas corpus if the court issues a
 written order making a finding, and stating the reasons for the
 finding, that the ends of justice that would be served by
allowing
 the delay outweigh the best interests of the public and the
 applicant in a speedy disposition of the application.
   `(ii) The factors, among others, that a court shall consider in
 determining whether a delay in the disposition of an application
is
 warranted are as follows:
  `(I) Whether the failure to allow the delay would be likely
to result in a miscarriage of justice.
  `(II) Whether the case is so unusual or so complex, due to
the number of defendants, the nature of the prosecution, or the
existence of novel questions of fact or law, that it is
unreasonable to expect adequate briefing within the time
limitations established by subparagraph (A).
  `(III) Whether the failure to allow a delay in a case, that,
taken as a whole, is not so unusual or so complex as described
in subclause (II), but would otherwise deny the applicant
reasonable time to obtain counsel, would unreasonably deny the
applicant or the government continuity of counsel, or would
deny counsel for the applicant or the government the reasonable
time necessary for effective preparation, taking into account
the exercise of due diligence.
   `(iii) No delay in disposition shall be permissible because of
 general congestion of the court's calendar.
   `(iv) The court shall transmit a copy of any order issued under
 clause (i) to the Director of the Administrative Office of the
 United States Courts for inclusion in the report under paragraph
(5).

habeas corpus; and

habeas corpus following a remand by the court of appeals or the
Supreme Court for further proceedings, in which case the
limitation period shall run from the date the remand is ordered.
   `(3)(A) The time limitations under this section shall not be
 construed to entitle an applicant to a stay of execution, to
which
 the applicant would otherwise not be entitled, for the purpose of
 litigating any application or appeal.
   `(B) No amendment to an application for a writ of habeas corpus
 under this chapter shall be permitted after the filing of the
 answer to the application, except on the grounds specified in
 section 2244(b).
   `(4)(A) The failure of a court to meet or comply with a time
 limitation under this section shall not be a ground for granting
 relief from a judgment of conviction or sentence.
   `(B) The State may enforce a time limitation under this section

 by petitioning for a writ of mandamus to the court of appeals.
The
 court of appeals shall act on the petition for a writ or mandamus
 not later than 30 days after the filing of the petition.
   `(5)(A) The Administrative Office of United States Courts shall
 submit to Congress an annual report on the compliance by the
 district courts with the time limitations under this section.

 determination of any appeal of an order granting or denying, in
 whole or in part, an application brought under this chapter in a
 capital case not later than 120 days after the date on which the
 reply brief is filed, or if no reply brief is filed, not later
than
 120 days after the date on which the answering brief is filed.
   `(B)(i) A court of appeals shall decide whether to grant a
 petition for rehearing or other request for rehearing en banc not
 later than 30 days after the date on which the petition for
 rehearing is filed unless a responsive pleading is required, in
 which case the court shall decide whether to grant the petition
not
 later than 30 days after the date on which the responsive
pleading
 is filed.
   `(ii) If a petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc is
 granted, the court of appeals shall hear and render a final
 determination of the appeal not later than 120 days after the
date
 on which the order granting rehearing or rehearing en banc is
 entered.
   `(2) The time limitations under paragraph (1) shall apply to--
  `(A) an initial application for a writ of habeas corpus;

habeas corpus; and

habeas corpus or related appeal following a remand by the court
of appeals en banc or the Supreme Court for further
proceedings, in which case the limitation period shall run from
the date the remand is ordered.
   `(3) The time limitations under this section shall not be
 construed to entitle an applicant to a stay of execution, to
which
 the applicant would otherwise not be entitled, for the purpose of
 litigating any application or appeal.
   `(4)(A) The failure of a court to meet or comply with a time
 limitation under this section shall not be a ground for granting

detection would contribute significantly to the prevention and
punishment of such unlawful acts; and
  (5) for the purpose of deterring and detecting such unlawful
acts, the Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for
the Purpose of Detection, Done at Montreal on 1 March 1991,
requires each contracting State to adopt appropriate measures
to ensure that plastic explosives are duly marked and controlled.

   TITLE VIII--NUCLEAR MATERIALS
 SEC. 801. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   (a) Findings: The Congress finds that--
  (1) nuclear materials, including byproduct materials, can be
used to create radioactive dispersal devices that are capable
of causing serious bodily injury as well as substantial damage
to property and the environment;
  (2) the potential use of nuclear materials, including
byproduct materials, enhances the threat posed by terrorist
activities and thereby has a greater effect on the security
interests of the United States;
  (3) due to the widespread hazards presented by the threat of
nuclear contamination, as well as nuclear bombs, the United
States has a strong interest in ensuring that persons who are
engaged in the illegal acquisition and use of nuclear
materials, including byproduct materials, are prosecuted for
their offenses;
  (4) the threat that nuclear materials will be obtained and
used by terrorist and other criminal organizations has
increased substantially since the enactment in 1982 of the
legislation that implemented the Convention on the Physical
Protection of Nuclear Material, codified at section 831 of
title 18, United States Code;
  (5) the successful efforts to obtain agreements from other
countries to dismantle nuclear weapons have resulted in
increased packaging and transportation of nuclear materials,
thereby decreasing the security of such materials by increasing
the opportunity for unlawful diversion and theft;
  (6) the illicit trafficking in the relatively more common,
commercially available and usable nuclear and byproduct
materials poses a potential to cause significant loss of life
and environmental damage;
  (7) reported trafficking incidents in the early 1990's
suggest that the individuals involved in trafficking these
materials from Eurasia and Eastern Europe frequently conducted
their black market sales of these materials within the Federal
Republic of Germany, the Baltic States, the former Soviet
Union, Central Europe, and to a lesser extent in the Middle
European countries;
  (8) the international community has become increasingly
concerned over the illegal possession of nuclear and nuclear
byproduct materials;
  (9) the potentially disastrous ramifications of increased
access to nuclear and nuclear byproduct materials pose such a
significant future threat that the United States must use all
lawful methods available to combat the illegal use of such
materials;
  (10) the United States has an interest in encouraging United
States corporations to do business in the countries that
comprised the former Soviet Union, and in other developing
democracies;
  (11) protection of such United States corporations from
threats created by the unlawful use of nuclear materials is
important to the success of the effort to encourage such
business ventures, and to further the foreign relations and
commerce of the United States;
  (12) the nature of nuclear contamination is such that it may
affect the health, environment, and property of United States
nationals even if the acts that constitute the illegal activity
occur outside the territory of the United States, and are
primarily directed toward foreign nationals; and
  (13) there is presently no Federal criminal statute that
provides adequate protection to United States interests from
nonweapons grade, yet hazardous radioactive material, and from
the illegal diversion of nuclear materials that are held for
other than peaceful purposes.
   (b) Purpose: The purpose of this title is to provide Federal
law
 enforcement agencies the necessary tools and fullest possible
basis
 allowed under the Constitution to combat the threat of nuclear
 contamination and proliferation that may result from illegal
 possession and use of radioactive materials.

               STATEMENT OF INTEREST OF AMICI

 The amici submitting this brief, who are described in greater
detail in the accompanying motion for leave to file, consist of
eight national law enforcement organizations together with
Handgun Control Inc. and the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence,
sister organizations chaired by Sarah Brady. The law
enforcement amici, taken together, represent hundreds of
thousands of law enforcement officers who face the daily threat
of handgun violence and who rely upon the Brady Act in the
ongoing war against violent crime. The membership of several of
the law enforcement amici, moreover, include police executives
who are subject to the Brady Act requirement that they conduct
"reasonable" background checks on handgun buyers. All of the
amici are committed to preventing handgun violence and to
keeping violent criminals, drug abusers, and other prohibited
persons from purchasing handguns. The Brady Act provides law
enforcement with a valuable tool in this effort. Indeed,
background checks conducted during just the first one hundred
days that the Act was in effect prevented an estimated 50,000
felons and other prohibited persons from purchasing handguns
from federally licensed dealers, including, for example, 1,220
denials in Houston, Texas, 624 denials in Louisville, Kentucky,
and 533 denials in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. [FN1]

 INTRODUCTION

 Congress enacted the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, Pub.
L. 103- 159, 107 Stat. 1536 (1993) [hereinafter "Brady Act" or
"the Act"], in the wake of "an epidemic of gun violence." See
H.R. Rep. No. 103-344, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. 8 (1993), reprinted
in 1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1984, 1985. The statistics behind this
epidemic are chilling: the Act's legislative history reports
that 15,377 Americans were murdered with firearms in 1992; that
12,489 of these murders were committed with handguns; and that
gun murders in the United States increased by 41 percent between
1988 and 1992. Id.

 The Brady Act "give[s] the law enforcement community a very
valuable and effective tool" to prevent convicted felons and
other persons barred by law from purchasing handguns. [FN2] To
serve this important goal, the Act contains two provisions.
First, the Act's "interim provision" requires that dealers,
importers and manufacturers of handguns obtain a statement from
prospective purchasers, which includes, among other things, the
name, address, and date of birth of the purchaser and a
representation that the purchaser is not under indictment, has
not been convicted of a felony, and is not a fugitive from
justice. 18 U.S.C. 922(s)(3). They must then verify the
identity of the purchaser and must provide the Chief Law
Enforcement Officer ("CLEO") of the purchaser's place of
residence with a copy of the purchaser's statement. Id.
922(s)(1)(A)(i)(I). Upon receiving notice of a proposed sale,
the CLEO is required to:

 make a reasonable effort to ascertain within 5 business days
whether [the proposed] receipt or possession [of the handgun]
would be in violation of the law, including research in whatever
State and local recordkeeping systems are available and in a
national system designated by the Attorney General.

 Id. 922(s)(2). If the CLEO determines that the proposed
transfer would not violate federal, state, or local law, the
CLEO must within twenty days destroy any documents or records
received or generated as a result of the CLEO's search. Id.
922(s)(6)(B)(i). If the CLEO determines that the proposed
transfer would violate federal, state, or local law, the CLEO
must, upon request of the transferee, provide a written
statement explaining the reasons for the determination. Id.
922(s)(6)(C).

 Second, the Act's "permanent provision" directs the Attorney
General to establish within five years "a national instant
criminal background check system" that any licensee can contact
to determine whether receipt of a firearm by a particular
purchaser would violate federal, state, or local law. See Brady
Act, 103(b). The Attorney General is required to have this
computerized federal database in place no later than February
28, 1999, at which time the "interim provision" automatically
expires. See 18 U.S.C. 922(s)(1).

 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

 Appellants' principal argument in this case is that the
straightforward, ministerial duties required of local law
enforcement officers under the Act's "interim provision" violate
the Tenth Amendment. [FN3] Appellants' understanding of the
Tenth Amendment is wrong. The Tenth Amendment does not protect
local officials from federal responsibilities, but rather
protects the constitutionally defined allocation of power
between the Federal Government and the States. Under that
allocation of power, Congress is afforded broad authority to
regulate interstate commerce and is afforded latitude to
"'employ the arm of the ordinary magistrate to execute its own
resolutions." [FN4] As we demonstrate below, courts have
repeatedly recognized that the Federal Government may require
that state or local officials apply (but not make) federal law,
and Congress has done so on numerous occasions. We further
demonstrate that the Framers of the Constitution clearly
envisioned that Congress would look to state and local officials
to apply (but not make) the law of the land, and early
Congresses enacted legislation implementing this understanding.
Finally, we demonstrate that Appellants' reliance on New York v.
United States, 112 S. Ct. 2408 (1992) (which involved a
congressional command to make law), is misplaced. Because the
Brady Act is fully consistent with the congressional power to
regulate interstate commerce and does not interfere with any
core, sovereign function of the States, this Court should
sustain the constitutionality of the Act.

 I. THE BRADY ACT IS FULLY CONSISTENT WITH THE TENTH AMENDMENT
AND CORRESPONDING PRINCIPLES OF FEDERALISM.

 "[T]he grave power of annulling an Act of Congress," United
States v. Gainey, 380 U.S. 63, 65 (1965), should be taken in
only the clearest and most extraordinary of circumstances. [FN5]
Where the elected representatives of the people act pursuant to
some constitutionally delegated power, the courts may not
second-guess the wisdom or propriety of their decision. [FN6]
Moreover, because the political process acts as a check on any
encroachment by the Federal Government on the sovereignty of the
States, federal statutes are entitled to great deference in the
face of Tenth Amendment challenge. [FN7] Presumably for these
reasons, the Supreme Court has sustained a Tenth Amendment
challenge to a congressional exercise of the power to regulate
interstate commerce only twice since the demise of the Lochner
era -- and the Court subsequently overruled one of those two
cases. [FN8]

 A. In Enacting the Brady Act, Congress Acted Well Within its
Constitutionally Defined Authority and Did Not Infringe Upon Any
Power Reserved to the States

 Appellants' contention that the Tenth Amendment prohibits the
Federal Government from requiring that state or local officials
perform even minimal, ministerial duties fundamentally
misconstrues the meaning and purpose of the Tenth Amendment.
"The Constitution does not protect the sovereignty of States for
the benefit of [state and local] public officials," but rather
preserves a separate role for the States to "'secure[ ] to
citizens the liberties that derive from the diffusion of
sovereign power."' New York, 112 S. Ct. at 2431 (citation
omitted). A federal statute, accordingly, is subject to valid
Tenth Amendment attack only if Congress has legislated in an
area beyond its delegated power, [FN9] or has employed some
method of regulating that threatens the status of the States "as
separate and meaningful decisionmaking, functioning governmental
entities." [FN10] The Brady Act does not implicate either
concern.

 1. Congress Has Ample Authority Under the Commerce Clause to
Enact Legislation, Like the Brady Act, Regulating the
Acquisition of Firearms.

 Legislation designed to prevent felons and other unauthorized
persons from acquiring handguns falls well within the broad
confines of the commerce power. As this Court held in United
States v. Nelson, 458 F.2d 556, 559 (5th Cir. 1972) -- and
recently reaffirmed in United States v. Lopez, 2 F.3d 1342, 1354
(5th Cir. 1993), cert. granted, 114 S. Ct. 1536 (1994) -- "the
acquisition of firearms by convicted felons and persons under
indictment for felonies . . . imposes a sufficient burden upon
interstate commerce to be a proper subject of federal
regulation." See also Huddleston v. United States, 415 U.S. 814,
833 (1974). The Brady Act is indisputably such a statute, and
thus falls easily within the scope of the commerce power. [FN11]

 2. The Method of Regulation Adopted in the Brady Act Does Not
Improperly Intrude on Any Core, Sovereign Function of the
States.

 Similarly, the method of regulation adopted in the Brady Act
does not threaten the status of the States "as separate and
meaningful decisionmaking, functioning governmental entities."
Texas v. United States, 730 F.2d at 355. While ordering that a
state legislature enact particular legislation strikes at the
core of state sovereignty, and thus crosses this line, see New
York, 112 S. Ct. 2408 (discussed infra at 16-18), imposing
limited, clerical duties for an "interim" period of time on
certain local officials does not.

 The power of the national government to "impose its will on the
States" is well established. Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452,
460 (1991) (O'Connor, J.). As the Supreme Court observed in FERC
v. Mississippi, 456 U.S. 742, 762 (1982), courts have repeatedly
"upheld statutory structures that in effect directed state
decisionmakers to take or refrain from taking certain actions."
In the FERC case, the Supreme Court upheld a provision of the
Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 ("PURPA") that
required state regulatory authorities, among other things, to
"consider" adopting specific "rate design" and regulatory
standards; to follow defined procedures when doing so; and to
make publicly available a written statement of reasons if the
proposed standards were rejected. [FN12]

 The Supreme Court has sustained a broad array of other federal
directives requiring that state or local officials "take or
refrain from taking certain actions." Thus, the federal
government may require that state or local officials: issue
bonds in registered, as opposed to bearer, form, see Baker, 485
U.S. at 514; adjudicate disputes arising under federal law, see,
e.g., Testa v. Katt, 330 U.S. 386 (1947); Mondou v. New York.
New Haven & Hartford R.R., 223 U.S. 1 (1912); regulate according
to federal instruction as a condition of receipt of federal
funds, see, e.g., South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203 (1987);
regulate according to federal instruction or face total
preemption of state law in the field, see, e.g., Hodel v.
Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Ass'n, 452 U.S. 264
(1981); comply with federal employment standards or guidelines,
see, e.g., Garcia, 469 U.S. 528; EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U.S. 226
(1983); Fry v. United States, 421 U.S. 542 (1975); and prepare
rules to enforce a treaty, and thereby implement a federal
court's interpretation of the rights of the parties, even though
"state law withholds from [the state officials] the power to do
so," see Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger
Fishing Vessel Ass'n, 443 U.S. 658, 695 (1979).

 For a number of important reasons, the duties imposed on local
law enforcement officials under the Brady Act are less intrusive
on state sovereignty than those upheld in these and other cases:

 First, unlike in New York, 112 S. Ct. at 2427-29, the Brady Act
does not set a political or legislative agenda for the States.
Rather, the Act merely requires that local officials perform
certain ministerial duties. It is the setting of policy that
"gives the State[s] [their] sovereign nature," FERC, 456 U.S. at
761, and not the performance or nonperformance of clerical
tasks.

 Second, also unlike in New York, 112 S. Ct. at 2424, this is not
a case in which the Federal Government is avoiding political
accountability by shifting to the States some function that the
Federal Government might equally well perform. To the contrary,
the Brady Act enlists the assistance of local officials because-
- at least in the near term -- background checks are most
effectively performed by local officials. [FN13] Moreover, there
is no ambiguity that the regulatory requirements of the Brady
Act are imposed as a matter of federal policy. Indeed, the form
used to conduct the background check, which is completed by the
prospective purchaser and forwarded by the gun dealer to local
law enforcement, is unmistakably a federal form. See Koog Record
Excerpts, Ex. 5, tab 8 at 2-3.

 Third, the duties imposed on local law enforcement officials are
not onerous. [FN14] The Act makes clear that local law
enforcement personnel must make only "a reasonable effort" to
determine whether the proposed transfer is lawful. 18 U.S.C.
922(s)(2). This obligation -- which will lapse as soon as the
federal instant check system is in place -- simply requires that
law enforcement engage in "the very type of activity" in which
law enforcement officials "customarily engage." [FN15] Cf. FERC,
456 U.S. at 760. The obligation that law enforcement officials
perform "reasonable" background checks before individuals are
allowed to purchase handguns pales in comparison with the
obligations upheld in cases such as Testa and FERC.

 Fourth, there is no reason to believe that any increased costs
that the States may bear as an indirect result of the Brady Act
even approach those imposed by the requirement, for example,
that state courts adjudicate certain federal causes of action.
[FN16]

 The Brady Act, moreover, authorized the appropriation of $200
million to the States, among other things, to improve their
computerized criminal history records, see Brady Act 106, and
Congress more recently authorized the appropriation of billions
of dollars to the States for law enforcement, see Violent Crime
Control And Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-322,
31001, 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. (108 Stat.) 1796, 1861 (to be codified
at 31 U.S.C. 6702). These appropriations plainly outweigh any
cost that the Brady Act may impose on the States. They also
demonstrate that "the national political process systematically
protects the States from the risk of having their functions in
th[is] area handicapped by Commerce Clause regulation." Garcia,
469 U.S. at 555.

 Fifth, the Brady Act imposes no direct obligation on the States,
see 18 U.S.C. 922(s), but rather imposes the obligation to
conduct background checks on local officials. In the past,
courts have declined to extend the protective cloak of
sovereignty to local entities or officials. See, e.g., Mt.
Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274,
279-81 (1977); Familias Unidas v. Briscoe, 619 F.2d 391, 404
n.13 (5th Cir. 1980). Any concern for state sovereignty is
minimized by the fact that the Act does not operate directly on
the States.

 In short, the obligations imposed on local officials under the
Brady Act are not the sort of obligations that are likely to
undermine the ability of the States to govern as distinct,
sovereign entities. Appellants' contention that the Brady Act's
imposition of limited, ministerial, and interim duties on local
officials violates the Tenth Amendment would require the
invalidation of a host of other federal laws, from a statute
that requires state law enforcement agencies to report cases of
missing children to the Department of Justice, 42 U.S.C.
5779(a), to a statute that requires states to keep records on
asbestos in schools, 20 U.S.C. 4013. [FN17] Such a result is
not supported by Tenth Amendment Jurisprudence, would serve no
useful purpose, and would undermine the effective application of
local knowledge and skill to the resolution of national
problems.

 B. The Framers Envisioned that Congress Could and Would Look
to State and Local Officials to Assist in Enforcing and Applying
the Law of the Land.

 Any possible doubt regarding the power of Congress to enlist
state and local officials in the application of federal law is
put soundly to rest by the historical record. That record
unequivocally demonstrates that the Framers intended that
Congress have the power to "commandeer state executives and
state courts, but not state legislatures, to help implement its
constitutional powers." [FN18] The Framers indicated on numerous
occasions that the State magistracy" -- that is, those state
officials who put the law into effect, as opposed to those who
create it -- might be called upon to apply federal law. [FN19]
Indeed, although the Framers recognized that "the power of
making rules or laws to govern or protect the society is the
essence of sovereignty," 3 The Complete Anti-Federalist 14.4
(Herbert J. Storing ed., 1981) (emphasis added), they showed no
reluctance to look to state and local officials to assist in
applying federal law. See infra nn. 21-24 and accompanying text.

 The federal power to require the aid of state and local
officials in applying federal law was widely recognized by both
those who favored a strong national government and those who did
not: Thus, Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist No. 27
that the Constitution "will enable the government to employ the
ordinary magistracy of each [of the states] in the execution of
its laws," The Federalist, at 221; in Federalist No. 16 that the
federal government "must stand in need of no intermediate
legislations; but must itself be empowered to employ the arm of
the ordinary magistrate to execute its own resolutions," id. at
165; and in Federalist No. 36 that "the probability is, that the
United States . . . will make use of State officers and State
regulations, for collecting" federal taxes, id. at 263, and that
"[t]he national Legislature can make use of the system of each
State within that State," id. at 261 (emphasis in original).

 James Madison similarly observed in Federalist No. 45 that "it
is extremely probable that [state officials] will be clothed
with the correspondent authority of the Union," id. at 328; and
that "the eventual collection [of internal taxes] under the
immediate authority of the Union, will generally be made by the
officers, and according to the rules, appointed by the several
States." Id. And perhaps putting the issue most clearly, William
McClaine stated: "The laws can, in general, be executed by the
officers of the states. State courts and state officers will,
for the most part, probably answer the purpose of Congress as
any other. [FN20]

 Although opposing ratification of the Constitution, Patrick
Henry similarly observed that "[t]he sheriff comes to-day as a
state collector" and the next day as a "federal" collector. 3
Debates at 167-68. Likewise, in a rejoinder to the Federalists,
Agrippa conceded that "[a]ll the state officers are . . . bound
by oath to support this constitution," and, by operation of the
Supremacy Clause, are bound "to execute the continental laws in
their own proper departments within the state." 4 The Complete
Anti-Federalist 6.19.

 This expectation that the national government would look to
state officials to perform ministerial tasks was not a novel
proposition, but rather emerged from -- and mirrored -- the
state practice of looking to local officials. As historian
Samuel Beer has observed:

 In America, state government has often relied upon local
governments to carry out its laws. At the time the Constitution
was being framed, for instance, Massachusetts had virtually no
administrative apparatus of its own but used the towns for such
purposes as tax gathering. In the 1830s Tocqueville observed
this feature of government in New England and praised it for its
ideal combination of centralized legislation and decentralized
administration. In Massachusetts, which he chose for the purpose
of illustrating the system, the towns were charged with
appointing assessors who would levy the tax specified by the
state legislature.

 Madison himself expected the new federal government to govern
through the state governments, rather in the manner of the New
England states in relation to their local governments.

 Beer at 252. Given this history, and the absence of a
substantial federal administrative apparatus, it would have been
surprising if the Framers had not expected state officials to
assist in the application of federal law. Early Congresses,
moreover, did in fact look to state and local officials to
assist in the application of federal law. Thus, in enacting the
Naturalization Act of 1790, the very same Congress that passed
the Tenth Amendment imposed certain ministerial duties on state
court clerks. [FN21] Shortly thereafter, Congress enacted
statutes requiring: that "the executive authority of any . . .
state or territory to which a [fugitive from justice] shall have
fled" return the fugitive from the state from which he fled upon
demand from the executive of that state or territory; [FN22]that
state courts "cause" the apprehension of certain persons --
presumably through the local sheriffs; [FN23] and that the local
justices of the peace, upon application by a ship's captain,
gather local citizens skilled in maritime affairs and decide,
with the citizens' assistance, whether and how a ship of
uncertain seaworthiness might be repaired before continuing its
voyage. [FN24] Appellants' broad argument that the Federal
Government may never look to state or local officials to apply
federal law cannot be reconciled with these early enactments.

 C. The Supreme Court's Decision in New York v. United States is
Not Controlling Here.

 In the face of substantial authority supporting the power of
Congress to enlist the aid of local officials in applying
federal law, and the overwhelming historical support for this
power, appellants rely solely on the Supreme Court's decision in
New York v. United States, 112 S. Ct. 2408 (1992). The New York
decision, however, dealt with a statute that, unlike the Brady
Act, "'commandeer[ed] the legislative processes of the States by
directly compelling them to enact and enforce a federal
regulatory program."' Id. at 2428 (quoting Hodel, 452 U.S. at
288) (emphasis added). It was on this basis that the Supreme
Court declared the statute unconstitutional. Appellants' attempt
to read New York so broadly as to render unconstitutional any
federal law requiring that local officials perform limited,
ministerial duties -- as opposed to requiring that the States
make law -- cannot withstand scrutiny.

 Appellants do not, and cannot, contend that the "take title"
provision at issue in New York even remotely resembles the
"interim provision" of the Brady Act. As the Court repeatedly
stated in New York, the question there was whether any
"constitutional provision authorizes Congress to command state
legislatures to legislate," id. at 2430, or put slightly
differently, to compel the States "to regulate in a particular
field" in Congress' stead, see id. at 2420. In concluding that
Congress lacks this power, the New York Court stressed that the
Framers expressly rejected a system -- embodied in the Articles
of Confederation -- that required "'intermediate legislation,"'
id. at 2422 (citation omitted), and noted that the statute at
issue in the FERC case was upheld because it did not "'directly
compe[l]' the States to enact a legislative program," id. at
2421.

 Unlike the statute at issue in New York, the Brady Act does not
require that the States make law, through either an
administrative or legislative process. [FN25] The Act,
accordingly, does not infringe on the "power of making rules or
laws to govern," which is "the essence of sovereignty." [FN26]
It does not "infringe any sovereign authority to set an agenda."
FERC, 456 U.S. at 785 (O'Connor, J. dissenting in part). It does
not implicate the host of difficult problems relating to the
enforceability of commands directed at legislative bodies, see
Prakash at 1977-80, and it does not diminish political
accountability, see New York, 112 S. Ct. at 2424. In short, the
Brady Act is an example of precisely the sort of federalist
legislation that the Framers envisioned, see supra at 12-16, and
does not interfere with the core sovereign function of making
law that was at issue in New York.

 II. THE CHALLENGED PROVISIONS OF THE BRADY ACT ARE SEVERABLE
FROM THE REMAINDER OF THE ACT.

 Although appellants' constitutional challenge is limited to
three of the requirements of the Brady Act, appellants insist
that the Act's entire "interim provision" must fall. As shown in
the brief of the United States, appellants' position on
severability cannot withstand serious scrutiny. It bears
emphasis, however, that even without the mandatory background
check provision, the Act will serve the end that Congress
intended -- and that amici firmly support -- of preventing
prohibited persons from obtaining handguns from federally-
licensed dealers. Before the Brady Act was enacted, police
departments in many states, as a practical matter, did not have
the opportunity to perform background checks on prospective gun
purchasers. The Brady Act's five-day waiting period, coupled
with the requirement that local law enforcement be given the
sworn statements of proposed purchasers, affords police that
opportunity. Even if not required to perform background checks,
many police departments will take advantage of the opportunity
the Act gives them to do so. [FN27] There is overwhelming
evidence that the Brady Act has provided law enforcement with an
effective and valuable tool. See generally BATF Report. There is
no reason to believe that police departments across the country
would not continue to use this important tool, even if not
statutorily required to do so.

 CONCLUSION

 For all of the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district
court in Koog v. United States, No. 94-60518, should be
affirmed, and the judgment of the district court in McGee v.
United States, No. 94-50562, should be reversed.

 11 In enacting the Gun Control Act of 1968, which the Brady Act
amended, Congress sought to "strengthen Federal controls over
interstate and foreign commerce in firearms.'' See H.R. Rep. No.
1577, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. (1968), reprinted in 1968
U.S.C.C.A.N. 4410, 4411 (emphasis added). At the time Congress
enacted the Brady Act, firearm-related injuries drained the
national economy of approximately $20 billion annually through
increased medical costs and diminished productivity. See H.R.
Rep. No. 103-344.

 12 See FERC, 456 U.S. at 758-771. The Court premised its
decision, in part, on the tact that Congress could have pre-
empted the field." Id. at 742. The same can be said here:
Congress could have, but did not, preempt the field. The FERC
Court also observed that, as a theoretical matter, states could
have avoided the federal requirements imposed by PURPA by
ceasing regulation of public utilities altogether, but conceded
that this was not a real "choice," particularly since Congress
had failed to provide any "alternative regulatory mechanism to
police the area in the event of state default." FERC, 456 U.S.
at 766. See also id. at 781 (O'Connor, J., dissenting in part).

 13 Many state criminal history records are either
insufficiently computerized or otherwise unavailable to the
federal government. "[O]nly 21 States now share their [criminal
history] data with the FBI," and "several States do not even
have their records on computer." 137 Cong. Rec. S8945-46 (daily
ed. June 27, 1991) (statement of Sen. Mitchell). As Attorney
General Reno commented during consideration of the Act:
"Background checks performed by local police remain the most
effective means of screening out ineligible gun buyers. It is
local law enforcement who best know the residents and
residencies within their communities. Local law enforcement can
check to see if a prospective purchaser resides at the given
address, and can access local, county, state and national
records ...." Letter from Attorney General Reno to Rep. Charles
Schumer (Nov. 9, 1993).

 14 The requirements that CLEOs destroy documents or records
received or generated as a result of the search, 18 U.S.C.
922(s)(6)(B)(i), and provide those precluded from purchasing a
handgun with a written statement of explanation, id.
922(s)(6)(c), are de minimis. Indeed, the written explanation is
required only when the CLEO determines that a handgun purchase
would violate the law and the would-be purchaser requests an
explanation. Of those whose purchases are blocked, few are
likely to request a letter of explanation, since people who are
attempting to circumvent the law do not generally go to law
enforcement to seek an explanation when they are caught doing
so.

 15 18 U.S.C. 922(s)(1). See National League of Cities, 426 U.S.
at 853 (noting that the Tenth Amendment is "not so inflexible as
to preclude temporary enactments tailored to combat a national
emergency").

 16 See Testa, 330 U.S. 386. Of course the "mere fact that a
federal statute requires a state to expend resources in
compliance therewith, by itself, is not fatal for Tenth
Amendment purposes." Ponca Tribe v. Oklahoma, 37 F.3d 1422 (10th
Cir. 1994). See also Hodel, 452 U.S. at 292 n.33; FERC, 456 U.S.

 19 See Prakash at 1990-2032; Powell at 659-64. The term
"magistracy" included both executive and judicial officers. See

796 (C.C.D. Me. 1836) (No. 5609) (Story, J.) ("I know of no
other definition of the term 'magistrate' than that he is a
person clothed with power as a public civil officer.").

 20 4 The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the
Adoption of the Federal Constitution 140 (Jonathan Elliot ed.
1827) [hereinafter "Debates"].

 21 Naturalization Act, ch. 3, 1, 1 Stat. 103 (1790). The Act
provided that an alien eligible for citizenship may apply to
"any common law court of record" in a state where he has lived
for one year, must take an oath, "and the clerk of such court
shall record such application, and the proceedings thereon." Id.
at 103-04 (emphasis added).

 22 Act of Feb. 12, 1793, ch. 7, 1, 1 Stat. 302. The obligation
imposed on state executives under this legislation exceeded the
similar obligation established in Art. II, 2 of the
Constitution, which does not extend to demands made by
territories. See also Puerto Rico v. Branstad, 483 U.S. 219
(1987).

 23 Alien and Sedition Act, ch. 66, 2, 1 Stat. 577 (1798) ("it
shall be the duty of the several courts of the United States,
and of each state, having criminal jurisdiction . . . to cause
[aliens targeted by the statute] to be duly apprehended")
(emphasis added).

 24 Act of July 20, 1790, ch. 29, 3, 1 Stat. 131, 132. The
duties imposed on the justices of the peace under this statute,
as with the other statutes discussed above, were more executive
than judicial in nature. In fact, Section 7 of this statute was
affirmed, against a challenge that it unconstitutionally
delegated "the judicial power of the United States" to a state
officer, precisely because the duties assumed by the State
justices of the peace were not those traditionally performed by
"courts of record." See Robertson v. Baldwin, 165 U.S. 275, 279
(1897).

 25 Appellants argue at length that the Tenth Amendment, as
interpreted in New York, not only precludes the federal
government from directing states to make law, but also prevents
the federal government from looking to the states to apply the
law. In support of this proposition, appellants point to the
Court's assertion that "[t]he federal government may not compel
the States to enact or administer a federal regulatory program."
Brief at 27 (quoting 112 S. Ct. at 2435) (emphasis added). But
this argument misses the point. The dicta upon which appellants
rely merely recognized that the federal government can no more
direct states to make law through administrative action than it
can direct states to do so through legislative action. As the
Supreme Court stated in FERC: "[T]he ability of a state
legislative (or, as here, administrative) body . . . to consider
and promulgate regulations of its choosing must be central to a
State's role in the federal system." 456 U.S. at 761. See also
Board of Natural Resources v. Brown, 992 F.2d 937, 949 (9th Cir.
1993) (holding unconstitutional a federal statute directing
state governors to "issue regulations"); Texas v. United States,
730 F.2d at 354 ("when state agencies are compelled to regulate
in accordance with federal law, it is inappropriate for courts
simply to rely on the political process, in effect abdicating
their powers to Congress"). Here, there is no contention that
the Brady Act requires that the States make regulations of any
sort.

 26 3 The Complete Anti-Federalist 14.4. Courts have
traditionally shown great deference to state law-making
processes. See, e.g., Supreme Court of Virginia v. Consumers
Union of the United States! Inc., 446 U.S. 719, 731-34 (1980)
(holding members of state legislative bodies absolutely immune
from suits for damages or injunctive relief); Murdock v.
Memphis, 87 U.S. (20 Wall.) 590 (1874) (federal courts cannot
tell state courts how to decide issues of state law). See also
Spallone v. United States, 493 U.S. 265, 279 (1990) (restricting
freedom of legislators "undermines the 'public good' by
interfering with the rights of the people to representation in
the democratic process").

 27 This is reflected not only by the participation of the
national police groups in this brief, but also by the
congressional testimony of police groups in favor of the Brady
legislation, which frequently noted the public safety importance
of screening handgun buyers. See, e.g., Brady Handgun Violence
Prevention Act: Hearings on H.R. 7 Before the Subcomm. on Crime
and Criminal Justice of the House Comm. on the Judiciary, 102d
Cong., 1st Sess. 78-81 (1991) (statement of Lee Brown, Comm'r,
New York City Police Department); id. at 109-11 (statement of
Hubert Williams, President, Police Found. & Chairman, Law
Enforcement Steering Comm.); id. at 112-14 (statement of Kenneth
Collins, Chief of Police, Maplewood, Minn. and President,
Minnesota Ass'n of Chiefs of Police); The Brady Handgun Violence
Prevention Act: Hearings on S. 1236 Before the Subcomm. on the
Constitution of the Senate Comm. on the Judiciary, 101st Cong.,
1st Sess. 65-72 (1989) (testimony of John Dineen, President,
Fraternal Order of Police, representing over 203,000
professional police officers nationwide); id. at 73-80
(testimony of Ralph Porter, Chief of Police, Florence, South
Carolina).

<P>A recent Department of Justice report analyzed 12,000 civil jury cases over a period in 1992 in 75 large counties. Among the report's findings: only 6% of successful suits result in punitive damages. Here's the press release announcing the report's findings.</P>

<P><B>BJS 202-307-0784</B></P>

<P><B>Civil Juries Award Punitive Damages In 6 Percent Of Successful Suits</B></P>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- A 12-month study shows that only 2 percent of some 762,000 state court civil cases decided in the nation's 75 most populous counties were decided by juries, the Department of Justice announced today.</P>

<P>The plaintiffs won 52 percent of the 12,000 jury trials, of which 6 percent of the successful suits resulted in punitive damage awards--half of which were for $50,000 or less.</P>

<P>Juries awarded about $2.7 billion in compensatory and punitive damages in the 6,200 successful cases, with a median award of $52,000 and an average award of $455,000. Twenty-two percent of the awards exceeded $250,000, while 8 percent topped $1 million.</P>

<P>Juries disposed of about 360 product liability cases during the study period. Plaintiffs won 41 percent of them. Of the 142 winning cases, three resulted in punitive damage awards.</P>

<P>Punitive damages are awarded when a defendant is found to have been grossly negligent. The study found that punitive damages were awarded in 30 percent of the successful cases involving slander and libel, 27 percent involving employment matters, 21 percent for fraud, 19 percent for intentional tort claims and 2 percent of motor vehicle suits.</P>

<P>Punitive damages were awarded in 6 percent of the cases involving toxic substances and in 13 of the 403 successful medical malpractice cases. In four of the 13 cases the award exceeded $250,000.</P>

<P>The study estimated that 79.3 percent of the 12,000 civil jury trials were tort actions, 18.4 percent were contract cases and 2.3 percent were real property matters. A tort case is one that alleges personal injury or property damage caused by a defendant's negligence or intentional misconduct.</P>

<P>Thirty-three percent of the jury trials involved motor vehicle torts, 17 percent were property liability matters, 11 percent involved medical malpractice claims, 5 percent were product liability or toxic substance cases and the balance concerned other issues, such as contract suits, slander or libel and business fraud.</P>

<P>The average time from the filing of a civil complaint to the jury's verdict was 2 and one-half years.</P>

<P>An estimated 87.5 percent of the plaintiffs in the civil jury cases were individuals, 10.7 percent were business firms, 1.8 percent were government agencies and 0.1 percent were hospitals.</P>

<P>Almost 53 percent of the civil jury trial defendants were businesses--including 100 percent of the toxic substance cases, 99 percent of the product liability allegations, 88 percent of the buyer plaintiff matters and 80 percent of the employment lawsuits.</P>

<P>The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) special report, "Civil Jury Cases and Verdicts in Large Counties" (NCJ-154346), was written by Carol J. DeFrances, Steven K. Smith and Patrick A. Langan, BJS statisticians, and Brian J. Ostrom, David B. Rottman and John A. Goerdt, of the National Center for State Courts.

<P>In what was viewed as a victory for former Chicago Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, the Court of Appeals for the D.C.

United States Court of Appeals
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
Argued March 17, 1995
Decided July 18, 1995
Nos. 94-3158 and 94-3160

United States of America,
Appellee

v.

Daniel D. Rostenkowski,
Appellant

Appeals from the United States District Court
for the District of Columbia
(No. 94cr00226)

Dan K. Webb and Howard M. Pearl argued the cause for appellant.
With them on the briefs were Thomas M. Buchanan and R. Kenneth
Mundy.

John R. Fisher, Assistant United States Attorney, argued the
cause for appellee. With him on the briefs were Eric H. Holder,
Jr., United States Attorney, Roy W. McLeese, III, Larry R.
Parkinson, Wendy L. Wysong, Randall D. Eliason, and Leslie A.
Blackmon, Assistant United States Attorneys.

Before Edwards, Chief Judge, Buckley, and Ginsburg, Circuit
Judges.

 Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Ginsburg.

 Ginsburg, Circuit Judge: Daniel D. Rostenkowski, a former
United States Congressman from Illinois, brings this
interlocutory appeal of two district court orders that in effect
allow the Government to proceed with his prosecution for
misappropriation of congressional funds. In the first order,
the district court held that Rostenkowski's indictment on its
face violates neither the Speech or Debate Clause nor the
Rulemaking Clause of the Constitution nor the doctrine of the
separation of powers. In the second order, the court denied
Rostenkowski's motions for in camera review of grand jury
materials and for a review of the evidence to be presented
against him at trial, both of which he argues are necessary to
the full development of the constitutional issues he raises.

 As to the first order: (1) in light of the Supreme Court's
recent decision in Hubbard v. United States, 115 S. Ct. 1754
(1995), we decline to determine at this time the
constitutionality of those counts of the indictment alleging
violations of 18 U.S.C. Section 1001, which counts we remand to
the district court for the purpose of entertaining such motions
as the parties may wish to make; (2) we hold that the remaining
counts present no problem under the Speech or Debate Clause;
but (3) we conclude that certain portions of those counts are
non- justiciable under the doctrine of the separation of powers
and the Rulemaking Clause. As to the second order: (1) we
affirm the court's denial of Rostenkowski's motion for in camera
review of the grand jury materials; but (2) we hold that we do
not have jurisdiction at this juncture to review the district
court's denial of Rostenkowski's evidentiary motion.

 I. Background

 On May 31, 1994 the grand jury returned an indictment alleging
generally that Rostenkowski and others had "devised ... a
scheme" to defraud the United States of its money, its property,
and its right to Rostenkowski's "fair and honest services."
Specifically, the indictment charges Rostenkowski with seventeen
separate violations of six federal statutessix of which are
associated with the general scheme to defraud and eleven of
which are each associated with one of four subsidiary "schemes"
to misappropriate funds, as follows.

 The General Scheme to Defraud: Counts 1-6. Counts One through
Six of the indictment focus upon certain communications that
Rostenkowski allegedly made in furtherance of the general scheme
to defraud the United States and the United States House of
Representatives. Counts One, Two, Three, and Five charge
Rostenkowski with mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sections
1341, 1346, & 2. Count Four charges Rostenkowski with wire
fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sections 1343, 1346, & 2.
Count Six charges that Rostenkowski tampered with a government
witness, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sections 1512(b)(1) and
(b)(2)(A). Specifically, Count Six alleges that Rostenkowski
attempted to persuade an employee of the House of
Representatives not to tell the grand jury that he had been paid
as a member of Rostenkowski's congressional office staff for
performing personal services for the Congressman.

 The Congressional Payroll Scheme: Counts 7 and 8.
Rostenkowski, like every Member of the House, authorized payment
of his staff out of his "Clerk Hire Allowance" by submitting the
appropriate forms to the House Finance Office. The indictment
alleges generally that Rostenkowski instructed certain members
of his staff to cash their paychecks and to deposit the proceeds
with Rostenkowski's office manager, who then "paid these
individuals later, in cash and in substantially smaller dollar
amounts than the checks themselves, as they performed services
for ... Rostenkowski." Count Seven charges specifically that by
submitting Payroll Certification Forms stating that certain
employees did official work when in fact they performed services
for Rostenkowski, his family, or his campaign, the Congressman
concealed a material fact from the House Finance Office, in
violation of 18 U.S.C. Sections 1001 & 2. Count Eight charges
that by improperly using his Clerk Hire Allowance to pay
employees for personal services rather than official work,
Rostenkowski stole, embezzled, and converted funds of the United
States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sections 641 & 2.

 The House Stationery Store Scheme: Counts 9 and 10. As a
Congressman, Rostenkowski could purchase office supplies for
official use from the Office Supply Service of the House,
commonly called the House Stationery Store, by charging those
supplies to his "Official Expenses Allowance." If a particular
item was not in stock, Rostenkowski could cause the Store to
order that item by completing a "Special Order Request" form
stating that the item was necessary for the conduct of official
business. Although a Member of Congress could also purchase
items for personal use from the Store, he was required to pay
for such items (plus a 10% service charge) himself.

 Count Nine alleges that by purchasing for personal use from the
House Stationery Store more than $40,000 of goodsincluding
crystal sculptures, wooden armchairs, and fine chinaand
representing that those goods were for official business,
Rostenkowski concealed a material fact from the House Finance
Office, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sections 1001 & 2. Count Ten
alleges that by using his Official Expenses Allowance to
purchase items that were used by him, his family, or his
friends, Rostenkowski embezzled and converted funds of the
United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sections 641 & 2.

 The House Post Office Scheme: Counts 11-14. As a Member of
Congress, Rostenkowski could use government funds to purchase
postage stamps for use on official mail. He needed only to
submit to the Office of the Postmaster of the U.S. House of
Representatives a signed voucher representing that the stamps
would be used for an official purpose. The amount of postage
purchased would then be charged by the House Finance Office to
Rostenkowski's Official Expenses Allowance. The indictment
alleges generally that Rostenkowski submitted vouchers (or
stamps that he had purchased with vouchers) to the House Post
Office and received cash in return.

 Count Eleven alleges that by covering up the fact that he
received cash rather than postage stamps in exchange for the
vouchers that he had submitted, Rostenkowski concealed a
material fact, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sections 1001 & 2.
Count Twelve alleges that by submitting fraudulent vouchers in
exchange for cash, Rostenkowski embezzled and converted funds of
the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sections 641 & 2.
Count Thirteen alleges that Rostenkowski conspired with then-
House Postmaster Robert V. Rota to exchange vouchers for cash,
in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 371. Count Fourteen alleges
that Rostenkowski exchanged funds from both his campaign
committee and his political action committee for cash from the
House Post Office and then concealed this fact from the Federal
Election Commission, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1001 & 2.
More specifically, Count Fourteen alleges that Rostenkowski
exchanged checks drawn upon the accounts of those committees for
over $28,000 in cash; that those checks bore his notation
indicating that they had been used to purchase postage stamps;
and that this notation caused those committees to submit
inaccurate campaign expenditure reports to the FEC.

 The Vehicle Purchase Scheme: Counts 15-17. A member of the
House of Representatives may, by submitting a valid lease
agreement to the House Finance Office, use funds from his
Official Expenses Allowance to lease a motor vehicle to be used
as a "mobile district office" for the conduct of official
business. The indictment alleges generally that Rostenkowski
bought vehicles for his personal use and, by submitting
fraudulent lease agreements to the House Finance Office, caused
$73,500 in funds of the United States to be paid to an auto
dealership for their purchase.

 Count Fifteen alleges that Rostenkowski made false statements,
in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sections 1001 & 2, based upon the
lease agreements that he submitted to the House Finance Office.
Count Sixteen alleges that by using his Official Expenses
Allowance both to purchase motor vehicles that he and his family
used and to rent garage space for a van that he owned,
Rostenkowski embezzled and converted funds of the United States,
in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sections 641 & 2. Count Seventeen
alleges that Rostenkowski spent $28,267 in funds from his
campaign committee to purchase vehicles for his personal use;
that he caused his campaign committee to represent to the FEC
that those campaign funds had been used to rent vehicles for
campaign purposes; and that he thereby concealed a material
fact from the FEC, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sections 1001 & 2.

 * * *

 At issue in this appeal are three motions Rostenkowski filed in
the district court. In the first, he moved to dismiss the
indictment upon two independent grounds. He argued first that
the indictment is, in its entirety and on its face, invalid
under the Speech or Debate Clause of Article I, Section 6 of the
United States Constitution; that clause provides that "for any
Speech or Debate in either House, [a Member of Congress] shall
not be questioned in any other place," and thus protects the
Member from prosecution for his legislative acts. Rostenkowski
also argued that the prosecution of all of the counts of the
indictment other than Count Six will depend upon judicial
interpretation of the Rules and Regulations of the House of
Representatives, and that those Rules and Regulations are non-
justiciable under the doctrine of the separation of powers and
the Rulemaking Clause of Article I, Section 5 of the
Constitution, which provides that "Each House may determine the
Rules of its Proceedings."

 In the second motion, Rostenkowski sought in camera review of
"all evidence presented to the grand jury." In the third
motion, he requested a bill of particulars, the production of
"constitutionally exculpatory information," and a pretrial
hearing. He argued that those procedures are necessary to his
ability fully to develop the constitutional arguments set out in
his first motion.

 The district court denied Rostenkowski's motion to dismiss in
one order and his other two motions in a separate order.
Rostenkowski appeals those decisions pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
Section 1291.

 II. Jurisdiction

 We first examine the basis for our jurisdiction over this
interlocutory appeal. Generally, the court of appeal has
jurisdiction to review only a final judgment of the district
court. See 28 U.S.C. Section 1291. In Cohen v. Beneficial
Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541 (1949), however, the Supreme
Court "carved out a narrow exception to the normal application
of the final judgment rule, which has come to be known as the
collateral order doctrine." Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United
States, 489 U.S. 794, 798 (1989). Under that doctrine, an
interlocutory order of the district court may be appealed
immediately if it: (1) "conclusively determine[s] the disputed
question"; (2) "resolve[s] an important issue completely
separate from the merits of the action"; and (3) would be
"effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment."
Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 468 (1978); see
Cohen, 337 U.S. at 546-47; cf. In re Continental Inv. Corp.,
637 F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1980) ("the possibility of irreparable
harm resulting from a delay in appellate review is the
dispositive criterion of interlocutory appealability"). We now
consider whether the orders appealed by Rostenkowski satisfy
that three-part test for review pursuant to Cohen.

 A. The Order Denying the Motion to Dismiss

 We clearly have jurisdiction to review the order of the district
court denying Rostenkowski's motion to dismiss. Because the
Speech or Debate Clause protects a Member of Congress "not only
from the consequences of litigation's results but also from the
burden of defending [himself]," Dombrowski v. Eastland, 387 U.S.
82, 85 (1967), post-trial review of an order denying a claim of
immunity under that Clause is insufficient to vindicate the
rights that the Clause is meant to protect, see Midland Asphalt
Corp., 489 U.S. at 800-01 ("deprivation of the right not to be
tried satisfies the ... requirement of being effectively
unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment"). For that
reason, and because the order in question self-evidently
satisfies the first two requirements of Cohen, it is subject to
immediate appeal under the collateral order doctrine.
Helstoski v. Meanor, 442 U.S. 500, 506-08 (1979) (Helstoski I);
see United States v. Durenberger, 48 F.3d 1239, 1241-42 (D.C.
Cir. 1995). For similar reasons, an order denying a claim of
immunity based upon the separation of powers doctrine is
appealable as a collateral order. See United States v. Rose, 28
F.3d 181, 185 (D.C. Cir. 1994) ("Like speech or debate immunity,
separation of powers immunity should protect legislators from
the burden of litigation and diversion from congressional
duties"); Durenberger, 48 F.3d at 1242; see also United States
v. Myers, 635 F.2d 932, 935-36 (2d Cir. 1980).

 B. The Order Denying the Supplemental Motions

 Our jurisdiction over Rostenkowski's challenge to the trial
court's second order is not as clear. In that order the
district court denied both Rostenkowski's motion for in camera
review of the grand jury materials and his compound motion for a
bill of particulars, the production of "constitutionally
exculpatory information," and a pretrial hearing to review the
evidence to be presented at trial. Rostenkowski now appeals the
denial only of his requests for in camera review of the grand
jury materials and for an evidentiary hearing. We address our
jurisdiction over each of those two decisions separately,
bearing in mind that the collateral order doctrine is to be
applied "with the utmost strictness" in a criminal case.
Flanagan v. United States, 465 U.S. 259, 265 (1984).

 1. Review of the grand jury materials

 The order denying Rostenkowski's motion to review the grand jury
materials clearly satisfies the first two elements of the Cohen
test: the decision "conclusively determines the disputed
issue," which is collateral to the merits of the case, i.e., to
guilt or innocence. See United States v. Deffenbaugh
Industries, Inc., 957 F.2d 749, 754 (10th Cir. 1992) (first two
Cohen elements met where district court denied defendant access
to certain grand jury materials). Whether that decision is also
effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment depends
upon whether an indictment would be deemed invalid solely
because it was procured by the use of material protected by the
Speech or Debate Clause. If so, then to delay review until
after trial would be to deny the Congressman the protection from
"the cost and inconvenience of litigation" to which he is
entitled under that Clause. Rose, 28 F.3d at 185. We turn,
therefore, to the question whether the protection of the Speech
or Debate Clause extends beyond the face of the indictment to
limit the materials that may lawfully be presented to a grand
jury.

 To repeat, Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution provides
that "for any Speech or Debate in either House, [a Member of
Congress] shall not be questioned in any other Place." The
Speech or Debate Clause is designed to "prevent intimidation by
the executive and accountability before a possibly hostile
judiciary," United States v. Johnson, 383 U.S. 169, 181 (1974),
and to ensure "that legislators are not distracted from or
hindered in the performance of their legislative tasks by being
called into court to defend their actions." Powell v.
McCormick, 395 U.S. 486, 505 (1969). In order fully to secure
those purposes, it seems that a court may find it necessary, at
least under some circumstances, to look beyond the face of an
indictment and to examine the evidence presented to the grand
jury. See United States v. Dowdy, 479 F.2d 213, 223 (4th Cir.
1973) ("If the speech or debate clause ... is to be given
meaning, the validity of an indictment must be determined in the
context of the proof which is offered to sustain it, or in the
context of facts adduced on a motion to dismiss it").
Otherwise, a prosecutor could with impunity procure an
indictment by inflaming the grand jury against a Member upon the
basis of his Speech or Debate, subject only to the necessity of
avoiding any reference to the privileged material on the face of
the indictment.

 The suggestion that the protection of the Speech or Debate
Clause extends to grand jury materials finds strong support in
the decisions of several other circuits and less directly in one
of our own precedents. In Rose we stated broadly that the use
of protected testimony "as background material for a [civil]
complaint would clearly violate the Speech or Debate Clause," 28
F.3d at 186; a fortiori it would violate the Clause to use such
material in order to procure a criminal indictment. Meanwhile,
the circuits that have focused their attention more precisely
upon the use of Speech or Debate material before a grand jury
are unanimous in their condemnation of the practice. See United
States v. Swindall, 971 F.2d 1531, 1543 (11th Cir. 1992)
(indictment must be dismissed where decision to indict based
upon submission of Speech or Debate material to grand jury);
United States v. Helstoski (Helstoski II), 635 F.2d 200, 204-06
(3d Cir. 1980) (dismissing indictment based upon wholesale
violation of Speech or Debate Clause before grand jury); Dowdy,
479 F.2d at 223 (4th Cir. 1973) ("it may be necessary to go
beyond the indictment [in looking for Speech or Debate material]
in order to obtain the full meaning of what appear facially to
be perfectly proper allegations"); see also United States v.
Durenberger, Crim. No. 3-93-65, 1993 WL 738477 at * 3-4 (D.
Minn. 1993) (submission of any Speech or Debate material to
grand jury requires dismissal of indictment). Both the purpose
of the Speech or Debate Clause and all the most relevant
decisions of the other circuits point forcefully to the
conclusion that the Clause protects not only against the
reference to Speech or Debate material on the face of the
indictment but also against its use before the grand jury, at
least under some circumstances.

 As compelled as that conclusion may seem, the Government
understandably contests it upon three separate grounds. First,
the Government contends generally that "an indictment returned
by a legally constituted and unbiased grand jury, ... if valid
on its face, is enough to call for trial of the charge on the
merits" and that the "validity of an indictment is not affected
by the character of the evidence considered" by the grand jury,
quoting respectively Costello v. United States, 350 U.S. 359,
363 (1956), and United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 344-45
(1974). While we accept the validity of those propositions in
general, of course, we do not think that they are applicable
where they would undermine the important purposes served by the
Speech or Debate Clause. Moreover, as one court has noted, it
is significant that Calandra involved the use of evidence seized
in violation of the Fourth Amendment rather than the use of
Speech or Debate material:

 Under the Speech or Debate Clause ... the constitutional
violation is the use of legislative acts against a legislator.
Unlike a violation of the Fourth Amendment, which the Calandra
court held to be a past abuse and thus the lawful basis for
subsequent grand jury questioning, it is the very act of
questioning that triggers the protections of the Speech or
Debate Clause.

 In re Grand Jury Investigation, 587 F.2d 589, 598 (3d Cir.
1978). For the moment, we express no view upon the question of
when the presentation of Speech or Debate Clause material to a
grand jury invalidates a facially valid indictment; we conclude
only that at some point the presentation of such material
requires the court to dismiss the resulting bill. Even the
Government seems willing to concede that pervasive violations of
the Speech or Debate Clause before the grand jury would
invalidate the indictment; that said, we do not see how it can
also maintain that we lack the jurisdiction necessary to protect
a Member of Congress from having to stand trial because of
something said or done in the course of speech or debate in the
national legislature. Nor does our decision significantly
threaten the "historical independence" of the grand jury. See
United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 47-50 (1992). Cases
that implicate the Speech or Debate Clause are thankfully rare;
to the extent that our decision will have any impact upon grand
jury proceedings, it will be limited to those few proceedings in
which grand jury secrecy must be reconciled with Speech or
Debate immunity, which is, after all, also a value of
constitutional dimension.

 Next, the Government contends that the possibility that the
submission of Speech or Debate material to a grand jury could
invalidate an otherwise valid indictment is precluded by United
States v. Johnson, 383 U.S. 169, 185 (1969). In that case the
Supreme Court, having determined that Speech or Debate material
had been presented to the grand jury and introduced at trial,
nonetheless merely reversed the appellant's conviction and
remanded the matter for retrial with the privileged material
expunged from the indictment. The Government argues from the
terms of the remand in Johnson that the Court did not consider
the grand jury proceedings relevant to its analysis under the
Speech or Debate Clause. We disagree.

 Johnson speaks only to the question of when a facially valid
indictment must be set aside because Speech or Debate materials
were put before the grand jury. The Court did not consider the
violations that took place in that case sufficient to invalidate
the entire indictment; rather the Court was confident that its
modification of the indictment cured any problem created by the
use of Speech or Debate materials before the grand jury. See
id. at 185 ("With all references to [Speech or Debate material]
eliminated, we think the Government should not be precluded from
a new trial on this count, thus wholly purged of elements
offensive to the Speech or Debate Clause"); see also Helstoski
II, 635 F.2d at 204-05 (Johnson does not always limit court
review to face of indictment). The Court in Johnson did not
address the anterior question relevant to our jurisdictional
analysis. Indeed, the Government admits as much when it allows
as how the Supreme Court "has never squarely addressed the
argument that ... presentation of Speech or Debate material to
the grand jury invalidates the indictment."

 Finally, the Government points to United States v. Carney, 665
F.2d 1064 (D.C. Cir. 1981), a two-page per curiam opinion, in
which this court said that "only those parts of an indictment
which are facially invalid should be dismissed on Speech or
Debate Clause grounds," and held that a "ruling denying ... a
motion to inspect grand jury minutes [for Speech and Debate
material] is unappealable" prior to trial. Id. at 1065. We
must agree with the Government that a decision here that grand
jury materials are subject to the limitations of the Speech or
Debate Clause would be inconsistent with Carney. We note also
the conflict between Carney and our more recent decision in
Rose, in which we undertook a close review of the testimony used
in the preparation of a civil complaint. In order to resolve
these conflicts, however, we think the better choice is to
overrule Carney. The simple fact is that the court in Carney
announced its conclusion without offering a reason, and we are
unable to imagine any consideration, other than those that the
Government advances and we find wanting above, for adhering to
that opinion. As we have seen, Carney failed adequately to
secure for Members of Congress the full protection of the Speech
or Debate Clause; accordingly, it has not been regarded either
by this circuit or by any other as an absolute bar to a court
reviewing grand jury records for material protected by the
Speech or Debate Clause.

 In summary, for the purpose of our jurisdictional analysis, we
conclude that at least under some circumstances the Speech or
Debate Clause prohibits not only reference to protected material
on the face of an indictment but also the use of that material
before the grand jury. Because delaying until after trial the
appeal of an order refusing to review grand jury materials for
Speech or Debate material could expose a legislator to a
prosecution based upon his legislative acts, we hold that the
district court order denying Rostenkowski's motion satisfies the
third requirement of Cohen. Accordingly, we have jurisdiction
to hear Rostenkowski's interlocutory appeal of that order.

 2. Evidentiary hearing

 We turn now to the district court's denial of Rostenkowski's
discovery motion. Rostenkowski argues that, insofar as the
Government may present Speech or Debate material at trial, the
district court's denial of his evidentiary motion fails fully to
protect his rights under the Speech or Debate Clause in the same
way as does the denial of his motion to review the grand jury
materials.

 The analogy is not convincing, however. Assuming that the
indictment is untainted by the submission of Speech or Debate
material to the grand jury, but that a preview of the evidence
that the Government proposes to present at trial would reveal
some Speech or Debate material, it would still not be
appropriate for the district court to dismiss the indictment;
rather, the court would merely prohibit the Government from
presenting that evidence at trial. Rostenkowski can obtain the
same relief by objecting to the introduction of Speech or Debate
material at such point(s) in the trial as the Government may
propose to put protected material into evidence. See United
States v. Tom, 787 F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir. 1986) (defendant is "not
entitled to an interlocutory appeal to avoid ... having to
defend against allegations made or evidence presented in
connection with a count on which trial will in any event
occur"). Because the district court can adequately protect
thedefendant against the admission of Speech or Debate material as
the need arises in the course of trial, Rostenkowski's motion to
review the Government's evidence prior to trial is not properly
subject to interlocutory appeal. Hence, we reject his claim
that "the government must specifically show before a trial its
ability to omit all danger of implicating Speech or Debate
materials"; prior to trial, the Government need show only that
the indictment is valid under the Speech or Debate Clauseboth
on its face and, as we have held, in its provenance.

 Rostenkowski also suggests an analogy to Kastigar v. United
States, 406 U.S. 441, 460 (1972), which provides that immunized
testimony may not be used to support an indictment. Under
Kastigar the Government must show that it has an independent
(i.e., non-immunized) source for all of the evidence that it
plans to present at trial; in that legal setting, the need for
a pre-trial hearing is quite compelling. Here, however, the
Government does not have to establish an independent source for
the information upon which it would prosecute a Member of
Congress. Rather, the burden of proof is the other way round:
the Member must show that the Government has relied upon
privileged material. See Government of the Virgin Islands v.
Lee, 775 F.2d 514, 524 (3d Cir. 1985) ("burden of establishing
the applicability of legislative immunity, by a preponderance of
the evidence, rests with [legislator]").

 Rostenkowski points out that some courts have indeed ordered a
pre-trial evidentiary hearing in order to determine whether
dismissal of a particular charge is required by the Speech or
Debate Clause. See McDade, 28 F.3d at 298; Lee, 775 F.2d at
524-25. In those cases, however, a hearing was necessary only
because the face of the indictment was insufficiently specific
for the court to determine whether "any charge in the indictment
Debate Clause." McDade, 28 F.3d at 298; Lee, 775 F.2d at 524-
25 (ordering hearing because court could not determine from face
of indictment whether alleged acts are legislative). Therefore,
the pre-trial hearings held in those cases are best understood
as being in aid of a challenge to the facial validity of the
indictment, and we will consider Rostenkowski's reliance upon
those cases in the context of his motion to dismiss.

 Finally, we decline to assert jurisdiction over the denial of
Rostenkowski's motion for a pre-trial hearing upon the ground
that it is pendant to the collateral orders over which we do
have jurisdiction. In Myers, 635 F.2d at 936, the Second
Circuit accepted pre-trial appellate jurisdiction of the
defendant's claim that the indictment failed to state an
offense, apparently upon the ground that the claim was pendant
to an interlocutory appeal under the Speech or Debate Clause.
As even the Myers court recognized, however, pendant appellate
jurisdiction is generally unavailable, see Abney v. United
States, 431 U.S. 651, 657 (1977); McDade, 28 F.3d at 288-89;
indeed, it is particularly disfavored in the context of a
criminal prosecution. See Abney, 431 U.S. at 657 ("the delays
and disruptions attendant upon intermediate appeal ... are
especially inimical to the effective and fair administration of
the criminal law"). The Myers court may be correct that because
of the "small class of criminal cases brought against Members of
Congress"most of which involve pre- trial appeals under the
Speech or Debate Clausethere would be "little [to] be lost in
the way of judicial efficiency" if pendant jurisdiction were to
be entertained, Myers, 635 F.2d at 936; but we do not see in
that consoling thought any affirmative reason why a Member of
Congress should be exempt from the rule against pendant
appellate jurisdiction. As we have already explained, the
district court is fully capable of protecting the Congressman
against the admission into evidence of Speech or Debate
material; to allow the appeal of an order denying wholesale
review of the evidence in limine would needlessly delay the
start of the trial with no discernable benefit.

 In sum, we agree with the district court that, assuming that the
indictment is valid on its face, the Speech or Debate Clause
does not require pre-trial review of the evidence to be
presented at trial. See United States v. Rostenkowski, Crim.
No. 94-0226 (D.D.C. Oct. 14, 1994). The Government's use of
Speech or Debate material in the course of a prosecution based
upon a valid indictment implicates only the substantive
protection of the Speech or Debate Clause against conviction,
not its procedural protection against prosecution. Therefore,
we hold that the district court's order denying Rostenkowski's
discovery motion is not a collateral order subject to appellate
review at this time.

 III. The Merits

 Before addressing the merits of Rostenkowski's appeal, we note
that since oral argument was had in this case the Supreme Court,
in Hubbard v. United States, 115 S. Ct. 1754 (1995), has held
that a false statement made to the Congress is not within the
ambit of the statute prohibiting false statements to "any
department or agency of the United States." 18 U.S.C. Section
1001. See Hubbard, 115 S. Ct. at 1764 (overruling United States
v. Bramblett, 348 U.S. 503 (1955)); see also United States v.
Dean, No. 94-3021, slip op. at 30-31 (D.C. Cir. May 26, 1995)
(Hubbard "narrowed the reach of Section 1001 to matters within
the executive branch"). Four counts of the present indictment
(Seven, Nine, Eleven, and Fifteen) allege that Rostenkowski
violated Section 1001 when he made certain statements to the
Congress; two other counts (Fourteen and Seventeen) allege
violations of Section 1001 that are predicated upon statements
he allegedly made to the FEC. It appears that Hubbard may
affect the status of all of the Section 1001 counts, both those
involving the Congress and, because of the uncertain status of
the FEC at the time the statements were allegedly made, perhaps
even the counts involving that body. See Federal Election
Commission v. NRA political Victory Fund, 6 F.3d 821, 823 (D.C.
Cir. 1993) ("composition of the Commission" with both executive
and legislative members "violates separation of powers").
Therefore, and because a "fundamental and longstanding principle
of judicial restraint requires that courts avoid reaching
constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding
them," Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Prot. Assn., 485 U.S.
439, 445 (1988), we do not now review the district court's
orders as they relate to those counts. Instead, we remand them
to the district court to entertain such motions as the parties
may make in light of Hubbard and to consider the relevance of
that case in the first instance. Of course, if the district
court determines that any of the Section 1001 counts survives
Hubbard , then Rostenkowski may file a new interlocutory appeal
in order to determine whether the prosecution of those counts
would violate the Speech or Debate Clause, the Rulemaking
Clause, or the doctrine of the separation of powers.

 A. The Motion to Dismiss

 Rostenkowski argues that his prosecution violates the Speech or
Debate Clause, and that the indictment (other than Count Six,
tampering with a witness) violates the doctrine of the
separation of powers and the Rulemaking Clause. In this
section, we consider those arguments only insofar as they are
based upon the face of the indictment, and, of course, we do not
consider the Section 1001 counts at this time. Although we find
no merit to Rostenkowski's claim under the Speech or Debate
Clause, we hold that certain portions of his indictment are non-
justiciable under the doctrine of the separation of powers and
the Rulemaking Clause.

 1. The Speech or Debate Clause

 The Speech or Debate Clause, which is a Member of Congress's
primary source of constitutional protection from criminal
prosecution, protects the legislator from executive and judicial
recrimination for his "legislative acts." See, e.g., Johnson,
383 U.S. at 185. The Speech or Debate Clause protects more than
just words spoken on the floor of the House, however; it
extends to all matters that are "an integral part of the
deliberative and communicative processes by which Members
participate" in their constitutional duties. Gravel v. United
States, 408 U.S. 606, 625 (1972) (committee reports protected);
see Doe v. McMillan, 412 U.S. 306 (1973) (committee hearings
protected). Nevertheless, "the Court has been careful not to
extend the scope of [the Speech or Debate Clause] further than
its purposes require," Forrester v. White, 484 U.S. 219, 224
(1988). Hence, its "shield does not extend beyond what is
necessary to preserve the integrity of the legislative process,"
United States v. Brewster, 408 U.S. 501, 517 (1972), and it does
not protect extra-legislative communications, such as
newsletters or press releases. Hutchison v. Proxmire, 443 U.S.
111 (1979).

 First, Rostenkowski argues that Count Eight, which charges that
he used funds from his Clerk Hire Allowance to pay for personal
services, runs afoul of the Speech or Debate Clause because it
intrudes into his constitutionally protected discretion over
staffing decisions and because its prosecution would "impede his
ability to deliberate and communicate, and will thus impair the
legislative process." The Government disputes those claims and
also makes the broader argument that "in light of recent Supreme
Court precedent ... personnel decisions are never protected by
the Speech or Debate Clause."

 This court has held that a staffing decision of a Member of
Congress is protected by the Speech or Debate Clause only
insofar as the employee's duties are "directly related to the
due functioning of the legislative process." Browning v.
Clerk, House of Representatives, 789 F.2d 923, 929 (1986)
(discharge of Official Reporter protected under Speech or Debate
Clause). Browning built upon our earlier decision in Walker v.
Jones, 733 F.2d 923, 931 (1984), where we held that the Speech
or Debate Clause did not protect the decision to discharge the
general manager of the House of Representatives restaurant
system, stating that:

 Auxiliary services attending to human needs or interests not
peculiar to a Congress member's work qua legislator may advance
a member's general welfare. To characterize personnel actions
relating to such services as "legislative" in character,
however, is to stretch the meaning of that word beyond sensible
proportion.

 The Government contends that we must narrow the Browning/Walker
standard for reviewing congressional staffing decisions in light
of the Supreme Court's subsequent decision in Forrester v.
White, 484 U.S. 219 (1988), which holds that a judge's discharge
of a probation officer is not a "judicial act" immune from suit
under the common law. We decline the Government's invitation,
however, because Rostenkowski's argument is unpersuasive even
under the Browning /Walker standard.

 The indictment specifically identifies several members of
Rostenkowski's staff who allegedly performed personal services
for him. There is no suggestion on the face of the indictment
that any of those persons had any, even the most tangential,
relationship to the "legislative process." Indeed, it would
appear that their placement on his staff was a mere pretext for
their payment out of congressional funds. At most, one might
infer that some of them performed some "[a]uxiliary services ...
not peculiar to [Rostenkowski's] work qua legislator." Walker,
733 F.2d at 931. In any event, Rostenkowski neither claims that
he cannot determine who the employees are from the details to be
found in the indictment nor argues that any of those employees
was in fact involved in the legislative process. The Speech or
Debate Clause presents no bar to the prosecution of Count Eight,
therefore.

 Second, Rostenkowski argues that the indictment improperly
relies upon his status as a Member of Congress in order to prove
his knowledge of House Rules, and thereby to establish that he
knew that his use of congressional funds was unauthorized. He
builds that claim upon a dictum in United States v. Swindall ,
971 F.2d at 1543, that the Speech or Debate Clause "protects
legislative status as well as legislative acts."

 The Swindall court, however, considered only whether the
Government may prove that a Member of Congress knew about a
certain law by demonstrating his membership on a particular
congressional committee. (The court ruled against the
Government). We do not understand that case to prohibit any and
all mention of a Member's status as a legislator. See McDade,
28 F.3d at 291-94. It was well-settled before Swindall was
decided that the Speech or Debate Clause does not prohibit proof
of a defendant's status as a legislator, see Brewster, 408 U.S.
501, and it has since been held that proof of a congressman's
status as a member of a particular committee does not violate
the Speech and Debate Clause. See McDade, 28 F.3d at 289-94.

 Next, Rostenkowski argues that the indictment must be dismissed
because his prosecution would require him "to offer proof of his
legislative acts to defend himself." Rostenkowski points to
nothing on the face of the indictment, however, to show that
such a defense is necessary or that his legislative acts will
ever be at issue in the trial. Moreover, to the extent that
Rostenkowski himself chooses to present evidence of his status
or activities as a legislator, we agree with the Second and
Third Circuits that the constitutional protection against his
being "questioned" for his legislative acts "does not prevent [a
Member of Congress] from offering such acts in his own defense,
even though he thereby subjects himself to cross-examination."
McDade, 28 F.3d at 295; see Myers, 635 F.2d at 942.

 Finally, Rostenkowski argues that the indictment is
impermissibly vague, and "does not contain sufficient factual
information for the court to determine whether dismissal of all
or part of it is required under the Speech or Debate Clause."
In this regard, he notes that the indictment does not define the
type of "official" work performed by his staff and that it does
not name the participants in the phone call alleged in Count
Four. But this is hardly the type of vagueness that makes it
impossible for us to determine whether "any charge in the
indictment ... [was] based on conduct that is protected by the
Speech or Debate Clause." See McDade, 28 F.3d at 298
(indictment not vague); compare Lee, 775 F.2d at 524-25
(indictment vague where it alleged that legislator went on
"legislative fact-finding" trip without identifying which acts
were not "legislative"). Moreover, the information Rostenkowski
seeks should be well-known to him, yet he makes no specific
claim that either omission implicates a "legislative act." Nor
does our independent review of the indictment reveal any other
instance of vagueness suggesting a violation of the Speech or
Debate Clause. Therefore, we find no merit in Rostenkowski's
claim that the indictment is vague in any way that might raise a
concern under the Speech or Debate Clause.

 2. The separation of powers and the Rulemaking Clause

 Rostenkowski next contends that the indictment is non-
justiciable under the doctrine of the separation of powers and
the Rulemaking Clause. His argument proceeds from Baker v.
Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962), in which the Supreme Court considered
the justiciability of claims potentially implicating the
political question doctrine. After noting that the various
formulations of the political question doctrine were
"essentially a function of the separation of powers," the Court
held that an issue is non-justiciable if "prominent on the
surface" of that issue one finds:

 [1] a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the
issue to a coordinate political department; or [2] a lack of
judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving
it; or [3] the impossibility of deciding without an initial
policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial
discretion; or [4] the impossibility of a court's undertaking
independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect
due coordinate branches of the government; or [5] an unusual
need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already
made; or [6] the potentiality of embarrassment from
multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one
question.

 Id. at 217. Contending that all six of these factors are
present in this case, cf. Nixon v. United States, 113 S. Ct.
732, 735 (1993) (different factors not "completely separate"
from one another), Rostenkowski makes alternative arguments for
dismissing the indictment under the doctrine of the separation
of powers and the Rulemaking Clause: (1) that the Rulemaking
Clause is an absolute bar to judicial interpretation of the
House Rules; and (2) that the particular Rules at issue in this
case are ambiguous and, because there are "no judicially
discoverable and manageable standards for resolving" those
ambiguities, not subject to judicial interpretation.

 a. The Rulemaking Clause as an absolute bar to judicial
interpretation of the House Rules.

 Rostenkowski argues that the Rulemaking Clause, which provides
that "each House may determine the Rules of its proceedings," is
a "textually demonstrable constitutional commitment" to the
House of the power to interpret House Rules. Therefore, he
contends, "absent a narrowly tailored statute empowering the
executive branch to act, the Rulemaking Clause of the
Constitution commits solely to the House the interpretation of
its Rules and the decision whether to discipline a member for
their violation." Pointing to laws that provide criminal
sanctions applicable specifically to Members of Congress, see,
e.g., 2 U.S.C. Section 437g (campaign financing requirements);
18 U.S.C. Section 203 (bribery); 18 U.S.C. Section 602
(solicitation of political contributions), Rostenkowski argues
that in the absence of such a law, the executive and judicial
branches may not "interfer[e] with the discretionary decisions
of Congress," such as how to interpret House Rules.

 Rostenkowski relies for this proposition principally upon United
States v. Eilberg, 507 F. Supp. 267 (E.D. Penn. 1980), in which
the Government brought a civil action against a congressman for
misrepresenting as "official" a number of toll telephone calls.
The court noted that the Government had conceded in that case
that "[e]nforcement of a purely internal House Rule by the
executive and courts would be an encroachment on the powers of
the House, a violation of the separation of powers, and a
violation of the textual commitment [presumably the Rulemaking]
clause." Id. at 276.

 The Government's concession in the earlier case notwithstanding,
see United States v. Durenberger, 48 F.3d 1239, 1245 n.5 (D.C.
Cir. 1995) (Eilberg is inconsistent with law of this circuit),
it is perfectly clear that the Rulemaking Clause is not an
absolute bar to judicial interpretation of the House Rules. See
Yellin v. United States, 374 U.S. 109, 114 (1963) ("It has long
been settled ... that rules of Congress and its committees are
judicially cognizable"). Rostenkowski's argument seems also to
rest upon the mistaken premise that the Government seeks to
impose criminal liability upon him for violating the House Rules
themselves. That is not the case, however. The indictment
alleges that he violated various federal laws of general
application; in no count does it predicate criminal liability
upon a nonstatutory violation. Therefore, Rostenkowski's
reliance upon Brown v. Hansen, 973 F.2d 1118, 1122 (3d Cir.
1992) (claim that Virgin Islands legislators violated internal
rules of legislature, based solely upon those rules, held non-
justiciable), is irrelevant, as is his observation that there is
no federal common law of crimes, see United States v. Hudson &
Goodwin, 11 U.S. 32 (7 Cranch 32) (1812).

 At trial, the Government will almost certainly rely upon the
House Rules in its effort to prove the statutory violations it
has alleged. Often, in a prosecution for fraud or embezzlement,
the Government must show that the defendant diverted the funds
of an institutionsuch as his employerfrom an authorized to an
unauthorized purpose. In order to make that showing it is
typically necessary to enter into evidence the institution's
internal rules governing the expenditure of funds. See, e.g.,
Carpenter v. United States, 484 U.S. 19, 23-24, 27 (1987)
(official policy and practice at newspaper used to prove
misappropriation of prepublication information); United States
v. DeFries, 43 F.3d 707, 708-09 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (mail fraud may
be determined from use of union ballots in violation of union
by-laws). A congressman's prosecution for fraud and
embezzlement of official funds is no different: in order to
prove several of the counts against Rostenkowski, the Government
must show that he diverted congressional funds from authorized
to unauthorized purposes. As the regulations governing the use
of official funds by a congressman, the House Rules are
necessary and proper evidence to make that showing. Indeed, if
Rostenkowski's argument were accepted it would effectively
insulate every Member of Congress from liability under certain
criminal laws. Neither the Rulemaking Clause nor the doctrine
of the separation of powers requires that result.

 This conclusion is well-grounded in the case law of this
circuit. In United States v. Diggs, 613 F.2d 988 (1981), a
Congressman who greatly increased the salaries nominally paid to
his staff out of the Clerk Hire Allowance and used the increases
himself for personal expenses, and also paid members of his
staff for performing personal services rather than official
work, was convicted of mail fraud and of making false statements
to the Congress. This court saw no problem in referring to the
House Rules in order to determine whether Diggs's use of
congressional funds was authorized. See id. at 994-96. Indeed,
after finding that "no House regulation or order authorized"
Diggs's use of the Clerk Hire Allowance, the court held that
"[t]he legal standard is the law and rules Congress has passed."
Id. at 996 n.41. The court also rejected Diggs's argument that
he had effectively been convicted for violating the House Rules:
"The defendant clearly was tried not for violating the internal
rules of the House of Representatives but for violating the mail
fraud and false statements statutes." Id. at 1001.

 We very recently revisited the question resolved in Diggs and
confirmed the conclusion first reached there. Specifically, we
rejected former Senator Durenberger's claim that his indictment
for violating the general conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. Section
371, should be dismissed because his prosecution would require
reference to the Senate Rules. See Durenberger, 48 F.3d 1239.
Any reference at trial to the Senate Rules would not change the
fact that "Durenberger's prosecution is grounded in a
substantive federal statute." Id. at 1245. We also interpreted
the Senate Rules to "impose a duty of honesty and ... [to]
operate on the assumption that [Senators] will not lie." Id. at
1244.

 Rostenkowski would distinguish Durenberger on the ground that
the standard stated in the Senate Rules implicated by that case
could also be found in a statute, see 2 U.S.C. Section 58(e),
whereas the House Rules at issue here have no statutory
counterpart. The purported distinction is surely irrelevant,
however; in Durenberger the court did not find reference to the
Senate Rules unobjectionable even in part because those Rules
were mirrored in a federal statute. Moreover, Rostenkowski's
distinction does not apply to Diggs, a case upon which the court
expressly relied in Durenberger. See id. at 1245 & n.5; see
also United States ex rel. Joseph v. Cannon, 642 F.2d 1373
(D.C.Cir. 1981) (canvassing House Rules for standard by which to
measure Member's allegedly illegal conduct).

 Finally, we reject as overbroad Rostenkowski's contention that
if a prosecution may in any way depend upon reference to the
content of the House Rules then congressmen will "forego
legitimate legislative action out of fear that judicial or
executive interpretation of [the House] Rules will subject them
to criminal liability." The Rules at issue in this trial have
no direct connection to the legislative processthey govern only
the internal payment of staff salaries and office expenses.
Moreover, the Speech or Debate Clause adequately protects a
legislator's "legitimate legislative action[s]." Our conclusion
here merely requires Members of Congress to abide by certain
laws (e.g., against fraud and embezzlement) of general
application.

 b. Are the House Rules involved in this case too vague for
judicial interpretation?

 Rostenkowski's second argument under the doctrine of the
separation of powers is significantly less ambitious (and
somewhat more successful) than his first. Here he contends not
that the House Rules are completely off-limits to the judiciary,
but instead that the Rules involved in this case do not provide
a "judicially discoverable and manageable standard for"
determining whether his use of congressional funds was
unauthorized, so that the interpretation of those Rules at his
trial would require a policy determination unfit for judicial
discretion. The Government's response is two-fold. First, it
argues that the Speech or Debate Clause is the only
constitutional protection provided to a Member of Congress;
hence, the doctrine of the separation of powers cannot bar the
prosecution of a Congressman. Alternatively, the Government
contends that the Rules at issue in this case are clear, or at
least clear enough to allow the court to interpret and apply
them without invading the province of the House.

 We note first that we agree with the intuition behind
Rostenkowski's argument: a sufficiently ambiguous House Rule is
non-justiciable. Of course, under Article III of the
Constitution the courts are the final arbiters of the law and
may not shirk their duty to interpret the law merely because it
is ambiguous. Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1 Cranch) (1803).
At the same time, however, the Rulemaking Clause of Article I
clearly reserves to each House of the Congress the authority to
make its own rules, and judicial interpretation of an ambiguous
House Rule runs the risk of the court intruding into the sphere
of influence reserved to the legislative branch under the
Constitution. See Cannon, 642 F.2d at 1385 ("In the absence of
any discernible legal standardor even of a congressional policy
determinationthat would aid consideration and decision of the
question ... we are loathe to give the [statute] an
interpretation that would require the judiciary to develop rules
of behavior for the Legislative Branch"). If a particular House
Rule is sufficiently clear that we can be confident of our
interpretation, however, then that risk is acceptably low and
preferable to the alternative risk that an ordinary crime will
escape the reach of the law merely because the malefactor holds
legislative office. See Durenberger, 48 F.3d at 1244 (court may
interpret Senate's internal rules where it "requires no
resolution of ambiguities"). Where, however, a court cannot be
confident that its interpretation is correct, there is too great
a chance that it will interpret the Rule differently than would
the Congress itself; in that circumstance, the court would
effectively be making the Rulesa power that the Rulemaking
Clause reserves to each House alone.

 Therefore, we reject the Government's argument that the Speech
or Debate Clause stands as the only protection from prosecution
that the Constitution provides to a Member of Congress. Though
that Clause may be most directly concerned with the question, it
does not supplant the doctrine of the separation of powers nor
authorize a court to set to naught the allocation of authority
in the Rulemaking Clause. Because we agree with Rostenkowski
that for a court to interpret a House Rule in the absence of
"judicially discoverable and manageable standards" would require
the court to make "an initial policy determination of a kind
clearly for nonjudicial discretion," and would run the risk of
intrusion into the legislative sphere, we must review the
individual counts charged in the indictment in order to
determine whether the trial court will be required to interpret
ambiguous House Rules.

 Counts One through Five. These counts are associated with the
broad scheme to defraud the United States, which overarches the
four specific schemes involving the Clerk Hire Allowance, the
House Stationery Store, the House Post Office, and the vehicle
leases. In order to prove that Rostenkowski participated in the
broad scheme, the Government must show that he participated in
at least one of the four component schemes. Therefore, we shall
delay our consideration of Counts One through Five until we have
considered the other counts and thereby determined whether (or
to what extent) any House Rule may be used to prove Counts One
through Five.

 Count Eight. Because Rostenkowski does not challenge Count Six
as a violation of the separation of powers, we turn next to
Count Eight. There it is alleged that Rostenkowski embezzled
funds from the Clerk Hire Allowance and converted them to his
own use, viz., to pay members of his staff for the performance
of personal services and not for the performance of official
work. See 18 U.S.C. Section 641.

 Rostenkowski argues that in order to prove Count Eight, the
Government must draw a line between "official work" and
"personal services," and that this line can be drawn only by
reference to ambiguous House Rules. He invokes two earlier
decisions of this circuit in support. In United States ex rel.
Joseph v. Cannon, 642 F.2d 1373 (1981), the plaintiff brought a
qui tam action under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. Section 231
(1976), alleging that Senator Cannon had paid a staff member for
the performance of purportedly "official legislative and
representational duties" when in fact the assistant was working
"extensively and exclusively for the Senator's reelection." Id.
at 1375. The court first noted that there was "no judicial
decision or administrative ruling" to guide its inquiry into
whether Cannon's use of congressional funds was authorized.
After conducting a review of the relevant rules, regulations,
and internal policies of the Senate, the court found that

 [T]here were ... no "manageable standards" for a court to apply
when viewing staff participation in a Senate reelection
campaign. Moreover, the inability of the Senatea body
constitutionally authorized and institutionally equipped to
formulate national policies and internal rules of conductto
solve the problem demonstrates "the impossibility of deciding"
the issue appellant poses "without an initial policy
determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion.

 Id. at 1383-84. Concluding that the adjudication of the
plaintiff's claim would require "the courts to monitor every
action taken by a Senator and his aide in an effort to determine
whether it is sufficiently "official' or too "political,' " the
court dismissed the case. Id. at 1384.

 In Winpisinger v. Watson, 628 F.2d 133 (1980), the plaintiffs
argued that members of President Carter's cabinet were
improperly "using the resources of the federal government [to]
provide the Carter-Mondale Committee with federal support." Id.
at 136. The court dismissed the plaintiffs' claim, holding that
its resolution would require the court to determine whether
executive actions were motivated by a genuine concern for the
public interest or by "political expediency," and that this
determination would impermissibly intrude the judiciary into the
affairs of a coordinate branch of government.

 The Government essentially concedes the first part of
Rostenkowski's argument, admitting in its brief that the
"difference ... between official work and personal services ...
is ... the key distinction in this prosecution." In the
Government's view, however, the court is well-equipped to apply
this distinction. Count Eight, we are told, is less like the
claim in Cannon or Winpisinger than it is the claim in Diggs
that the congressman had unlawfully used his Clerk Hire
Allowance. Diggs argued that he had lawful authority to
increase the salaries of his staff and to use that increase to
pay official expenses. The court disagreed:

 The defendant's argument erroneously equates a congressman's
discretion to define the duties of an employee with the
unfettered power to divert monies intended for one purpose to
another completely unauthorized purpose. ... [T]he allowance
for clerk-hire and the allowance for district office expenses
were separate and distinct. No House regulation or ordinance
authorized the commingling of these funds, either directly, or
as in this case, indirectly. Had Congress intended that the
clerk-hire funds be used to pay expenses of the district office
it could have so provided.

 Diggs, 613 F.2d at 995-96 (emphases omitted). Diggs also argued
that he had the discretion to employ staff members to render
"concededly ... personal services," and therefore that his
"failure to reveal the exact nature of [those] employees'
responsibilities" to the House did not amount to the concealment
of a material fact. Id. at 1002. The court rejected this
argument as well: "The defendant's representations that ...
[the employees] were bona fide congressional employees ... were
fraudulent and material in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1001".
Id. at 1002.

 The Government distinguishes Cannon on the ground that there was
in that case a "complete absence" of standards to determine the
key issue, namely whether campaign activity could be considered
"official." Cannon, 642 F.2d at 1379. According to the
Government, the court in Cannon was being asked to draw a line
between "official" work and "campaign-related" work although it
was not clear that the Congress itself had recognized such a
distinction. Here, in contrast, the House Rules assertedly make
it clear that the House recognizes a line between "official" and
"personal" work.

 The Government documents its point as follows. First, 31 U.S.C.
Section 1301(a) requires generally that "[a]ppropriations shall
be applied only to the objects for which the appropriations were
made except as otherwise provided by law." Next, the annual
Legislative Branch Appropriations Acts authorize a specific
level of funding "[f]or staff employed by each Member in the
discharge of his official and representational duties." See,
e.g., 1991 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, Public Law
101-520, 104 Stat. 2254 (1990). Finally, the law provides that
"the Committee on House Administration may ... fix and adjust
terms, conditions, and other provisions pertaining to those
allowances)," 2 U.S.C. Section 57, which the Committee on House
Administration did when it prohibited the personal use of funds
from that allowance in the Congressional Handbook. The Handbook
"provides in a single source the Regulations and Procedures for
Allowances and Expenses for Members, Committees, and Employees
of the House," U.S. House of Representatives, Comm. on House
Administration, Congressional Handbook, at III (1985). The
Government argues that the House Rules contained therein draw a
clear line between "personal services" and "official work":

 The Clerk Hire Allowance is provided for the employment of staff
in the Member's Washington D.C. congressional office and
district office(s). ... [It] may not be used to defray any
personal, political or campaign related expenses, nor expenses
related to the conduct of committee business.

 Id. at 2.1.

 Thus, while Rostenkowski and the Government agree that the
resolution of Count Eight requires the Court to draw a line
between "official work" and "personal services," they disagree
about whether we can draw that line without interpreting
ambiguous House Rules. Let us see.

 First, although Diggs, Cannon, and Winpisinger are all relevant
to our analysis of the question, we think that none of them is
controlling. In Diggs, the court never had to determine whether
the work performed by the employees was "official." Diggs's
first argument was rejected because the phony salary increases
were used to pay for office expenses, not because they were used
to pay for services that were not "official." Nor did the court
need to distinguish personal services from official work in
order to reject his second argument: Diggs conceded that the
services performed by the members of his staff were "personal"
and therefore not "official"; hence, the only question before
the court was the materiality of that fact.

 Similarly, Cannon is not controlling because the court did not
need to determine whether the particular activities alleged were
"official" or "campaign-related" but only whether any
congressional rule distinguished between "official work" and
concededly "campaign-related" work. In Rostenkowski's case, we
know from the Rule cited by the Government that the Congress has
distinguished "personal" from "official" expenses; the harder
question before us is whether those terms are sufficiently
clear, either inherently or as interpreted by the House itself,
that we may proceed to apply them to the facts alleged in the
indictment. Winpisinger is unhelpful because there the court
had no standard at all by which to decide whether the
defendants' conduct was "official." Here, as the Government has
shown, both the Appropriations Acts and the Handbook provide us
with at least some guidance.

 Whether we can discern a line between "official work" and
"personal services" that is sufficiently clear to allow us to
classify the activities of a congressman's staff is a question
of first impression. The Government contends that the
Appropriations Acts and the Handbook provide a "judicially
discoverable and manageable standard[ ]" for resolving that
question. We are not so sure. It is clear enough that the
Congress has drawn a line between use of the Clerk Hire
Allowance to employ staff assisting "in the discharge of
official and representative duties" (permissible under the
Annual Appropriations Acts) and use of that allowance "to defray
personal, political or campaign related allowances" (prohibited
by 2 U.S.C. Section 57; 31 U.S.C. Section 1301; and the
Handbook ). Precisely where the Congress drew that
lineessentially the line between "official work" and "personal
services"is not so clear, however. The Government has pointed
us to very little in the Handbook or elsewhere that would help
us to determine whether the activities allegedly performed by
Rostenkowski's staff were "official work" or "personal
services." Moreover, as Rostenkowski notes, the House has not
attempted to define a Member's "official and representative
duties," and has in large measure vested Members with
"discretion to fix the terms and conditions of employment" of
staff members. Handbook at 2.3, 2.14. Without more guidance
from the House, there may well be allegations as to which the
court may not venture to interpret the terms "official" and
"personal" without making an "initial policy determination of a
kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion" or inviting the
"embarrassment [of] multifarious pronouncements by various
departments." Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. at 217; see also United
States v. Eilberg, 553 F.Supp. 1, 5 (D.D.C. 1981) ("strictly
official" standard clearly applicable to some congressional
phone calls but not so clearly applicable to others).

 We turn now to consider whether the activities allegedly
performed by the staff members identified in Count Eight can
clearly be classified as "personal services." (Although Count
Eight does not itself detail the specific activities in
question, the allegations of Count Eight relate back to the
activities of the fourteen employees identified in Count Seven,
the other Congressional Payroll Count). Because eight of those
fourteen employees were no longer allegedly on the Congressional
Payroll during the period covered by Count Eight (beginning "on
or about December 1, 1988") we presume that the Government does
not plan to prove Count Eight by proffering evidence relating to
any but the six other identified employees; therefore, we limit
the scope of our analysis to the activities that they allegedly
performed.

 Where, after reviewing the alleged activity of a particular
employee, we find that the Rules provide a "judicially
discoverable and manageable" standard clearly indicating that
the activity was a "personal service" (or was not "official
work"), the allegation may stand and the Government may attempt
to prove its case. Where, however, we conclude that the Rules
do not provide a standard that is justiciable or the indictment
is too vague to enable us to determine whether the alleged
activity may clearly be labeled as a "personal service" under
the Rules, the allegation is non-justiciable and Rostenkowski
may not be tried upon that basis. In sum, unless we can
determine that the facts set out in a particular allegation
could not be authorized under any reasonable interpretation of
the House Rules, we must find that allegation non-justiciable.

 (1) Employee Two is alleged to have performed "personal
services" for Rostenkowski, "such as engraving gift items and
mounting souvenirs on plaques." For our resolution of the
latter allegation, the Government refers us only to Section
2.I.A, the General Introduction to the Handbook, in which the
distinction between "personal" and "official" is reflected but
not explained. For all we can tell, "mounting souvenirs" might
well be considered "official work"much like decorating the
officein the context of an institution to which tens of
thousands of visitors come every year, many of them stopping
specifically to see their congressman's office.

 For our resolution of the allegation that Employee Two
"engrav[ed] gift items," however, the Handbook offers greater
guidance, for it clearly prohibits (at Section 2.III.F.10) the
use of the Official Expenses Allowance to purchase gifts (except
under certain circumstances). Insofar as the "gift items"
allegedly engraved by Employee Two were (or were to be) given
away by Rostenkowski as gifts (and do not come under the
exceptions listed in Section 2.III.F.10), we can be certain that
the gifts themselves were personal rather than official, and
that Employee Two's engraving of those items constituted
"personal services." Therefore, only the allegation that
Employee Two performed "personal services" such as "engraving
gift items" is justiciable.

 (2) Employees Eight, Ten, and Twelve are alleged to have
performed "little or no official work in the congressional
office." From this allegation it is not clear whether the
Government means to show that these employees performed work but
that the work they performed was not "official." Because the
Government has not shown us that what "little" work they may
have done was not "official," we must hold that the allegations
relating to Employees Eight, Ten, and Twelve are non-justiciable
except to the extent that the Government may prove that they did
"no ... work at all."

 (3) Employee Eleven is alleged to have done "little or no
official work" and to have "performed regular bookkeeping
duties" for a private insurance company that Rostenkowski owned.
No reasonable interpretation of "official work" performed by a
congressional staffer could include the performance of
bookkeeping work for a private company owned by a Congressman.
Therefore, insofar as the Government seeks to show that Employee
Eleven was paid from the Clerk Hire Allowance for the
performance of such work, the House Rules are clear and no
barrier to prosecution.

 (4) Employee Thirteen is alleged to have done "little or no
official work" and to have performed "personal services for ...
Rostenkowski, such as picking up his laundry, driving his family
members around Washington, and working at campaign events."
Because the performance of those activities might, in some
circumstances, directlyeven vitallyaid a Congressman in the
performance of his official duties, we cannot say that the
services allegedly performed by Employee Thirteen could not be
considered "official" rather than "personal" under any
reasonable interpretation of the House Rules. In addition, we
cannot be confident, without more information, that the
allegedly "campaign-related" activities were in fact "campaign-
related" under the Rules. For these reasons, we hold that the
allegations relating to Employee Thirteen are non-justiciable.

 Count Ten. Rostenkowski is charged with having embezzled and
converted funds from the Official Expenses Allowance by:

 causing a variety of valuable consumer goods and gift
merchandise obtained by him from the House Stationery Store,
including armchairs, luggage, sets of china, and crystal
sculptures of the U.S. Capitol ... to be paid for as supplies
necessary for the official use, when in fact the goods he
obtained were for the personal use of himself, his family, or
his friends.

 More specifically, the indictment alleges that Rostenkowski
either kept these items for his personal use or "gave [them] as
personal gifts to friends and associates." Like Count Eight,
Count Ten requires the court to draw a line between "official"
and "personal"here, the line lies between "official use" and
"personal use" rather than between "official work" and "personal
services." Again, the Government contends that the House Rules
provide a manageable standard.

 The Government begins with an annual Legislative Appropriations
Act, such as Public Law 101-520, 104 Stat. 2254 (1990), which
provides funds "[f]or allowances and expenses as authorized by
House resolution or law," and with three sections of the
Handbook. First, the Government points us to Section 2.I.A. of
the Handbook, which states both that "[t]he Official Expenses
Allowance is provided to pay ordinary and necessary business
expenses incurred by the Member (and/or the Member's employees)
duties to the district from which he/she was elected," and that
the allowance "may not be used to defray any personal political
or campaign related expenses." Second, the Government refers us
to Section 2.III.C.5.a(6) of the Handbook, which provides that
items ordered from the House Store "not for official use" should
be identified and paid for (along with a service charge of 10%)
from the Member's personal funds.

 Once again it seems that while the House Rules certainly
contemplate a line between the "official" and the "personal,"
they do little to indicate where that boundary lies. The third
Regulation to which the Government points provides some
guidance, however. Under the heading of "General Expenses and
Procedures," Section 2.III.F.10, the Handbook states:

 Expenses for gifts or donations of any type, except U.S. flags
flown over the Capitol and items purchased for presentation when
on official travel for the House of Representatives outside the
U.S., its territories and possessions, are not payable from the
Official Expenses Allowance.

 (Emphasis in original). This statement could hardly be clearer:
funds from the Official Expenses Allowance may not be used to
purchase gifts except under certain clear and limited
circumstances. Hence, the Government may prove Count Ten by
showing that Rostenkowski purchased gifts outside the exception
in the above-quoted provision with funds from his Official
Expenses Allowance. To the extent, if any, that the
Government's case depends upon showing that Rostenkowski
purchased items for his "personal" use, however, Count Ten is
non-justiciable; as we have already seen in our consideration
of Count Eight, without explanation in the Rules that term is
too ambiguous to support the prosecution of a Member of
Congress.

 Counts Twelve and Thirteen. The House Post Office Counts allege
that Rostenkowski violated 18 U.S.C. Sections 641 & 2
("willfully stole, embezzled, and converted to his own use ...
funds of the United States") by submitting postage stamp
vouchers to get cash. Essentially, the Government must show
that the House Rules did not authorize the disbursement of cash
from the Official Expenses Allowance in exchange for those
vouchers. Cf. United States v. Faust, 850 F.2d 575, 580 (9th
Cir. 1988) (affirming conviction for embezzlement under Section
641 where defendant, although ultimately entitled to the funds,
"intentionally deprived the government of the rights of
supervision and control upon which the government insisted").
That showing requires no interpretation of ambiguous House
Rules: Section 2.III.F.16.d of the Handbook provides that a
congressman may submit a voucher and receive "postage or postage
stamps for the mailing costs of official mail." Under no
reasonable interpretation of that Rule (or of any other of which
we are aware) would a congressman be authorized to submit a
voucher for postage stamps and get cash in exchange.

 Count Sixteen. In this count the Government alleges that
Rostenkowski, through two schemes related to the leasing of
vehicles for official use, embezzled congressional funds and
converted them to his own use. In the first scheme alleged,
Rostenkowski submitted fraudulent lease agreements, thereby
causing the House Finance Office to make monthly payments from
the Official Expenses Allowance to lease a mobile district
office for Rostenkowski's official use when in fact "no vehicles
were being leased at all, and the payments were being used to
cover the cost of purchasing vehicles that were titled to, and
owned by, Rostenkowski." In the second scheme alleged,
Rostenkowski caused the House Finance Office to pay for garaging
a vehicle he owned by representing that the vehicle was "leased
by Congress" as a mobile district office for his use.

 Adjudication of Count Sixteen requires no judicial
interpretation of any House Rule at all. In order to prove
Count Sixteen, the Government needs to show only that
Rostenkowski purchased a vehicle (titled in his name) with funds
authorized for leasing a vehicle; and that the garaged vehicle
was owned by Rostenkowski rather than leased. A court is well
able to discern the difference between "leasing" a vehicle and
"purchasing" (or "owning") a vehicle, and there is no need to
determine whether Rostenkowski used the purchased vehicles for
"official" or for "personal" purposes. Rostenkowski has pointed
us to no section of the House Rules that could be interpreted to
authorize a Congressman to cause the Government to pay for his
purchase of a vehicle (by falsely representing that he is
leasing the vehicle, no less) for use as a mobile district
office. So long as the Government does not try to show that the
vehicles in question were used for "personal" rather than
"official" purposes, the House Rules are no bar to the
justiciability of Count Sixteen.

 We recur now to Counts One through Five. Those counts are
justiciable to the extent that they are consistent with the
conclusions above: the Government may not prove those counts at
trial by reference to any House Rule that we have determined is
not subject to judicial interpretation. Otherwise, Counts One
through Five are justiciable.

 If we seem to have been overly cautious in our analysis or to
have allowed that some activities that were most likely
"personal" might have been "official" depending upon the
circumstances, we have good reason. First, because the doctrine
of the separation of powers lies at the very heart of our
constitutional system, we must avoid interpreting the term
"personal" any more broadly than necessary. If there can be a
reasonable doubt about whether, assuming that the allegations of
the indictment are true, a Member used congressional resources
for his own benefit in violation of a House Rule, then the court
cannot presume to interpret the rule.

 Second, the life of a congressmanas incumbent legislator and
perpetual candidate for office, whose official day ends only
after a round of nominally "social" events at which he is
obliged to appear, and his weekends and holidays are only an
opportunity to reconnect with his constituentsmakes the line
between "official work" and "personal services" particularly
difficult to draw. Anticipating the point, the Government makes
a rhetorical feint: "Ordinary people understand the difference
between official duties and personal services...." That is,
however, an invitation to "mobocracy," and after-the-fact
mobocracy at that. For the "ordinary person," unlike a
legislator, the distinction between work and life may be
relatively clear. For a Congressman, it is not so clear;
service in the United States Congress is not a job like any
other, it is a constitutional role to be played upon a
constitutional stage. Therefore, the Executive may not expect
the Judiciary to resolve against a Member of Congress an
ambiguity in the Rules by which the Legislature governs itself,
if reason allows otherwise.

 B. In Camera Review of Grand Jury Materials

 We determined above (in Part II.B.) that we have jurisdiction to
hear Rostenkowski's interlocutory appeal of the district court's
order denying his motion for in camera review of grand jury
materials. We now consider the merits of that appeal, i.e.,
whether the district court should have reviewed those materials.

 As a threshold matter, we reject Rostenkowski's argument that
the district court must review the grand jury materials solely
because he is a Member of Congress. Rostenkowski asserts that
"when a defendant moves to dismiss an indictment on Speech or
Debate grounds, a court must look beyond the face of the
indictment to determine whether protected materials were used in
the preparation of the indictment"; indeed, he contends that we
so held in Rose. But that is not correct. (Or as better put by
Robert Herrick in "The Rose" (1647), "Ne'er the rose without the
thorn"). In that case we considered only whether the use of
Speech or Debate material in the preparation of a civil
complaint would invalidate the complaint. We did not consider,
much less determine the question with which we are concerned
herewhether or when the district court must grant a motion for
in camera review, made by a defendant searching for Speech or
Debate materials. Nor need we answer that question today in
order to conclude that the district court did not err by denying
Rostenkowski's motion for in camera review. For regardless of
the precise showing that a defendant must make in order to
compel in camera review of grand jury material, we are confident
that Rostenkowski has not made it.

 As we have already seen, there is no reason on the face of the
indictment to suggest that any Speech or Debate material was
presented to the grand jury. Moreover, Rostenkowski offers
virtually no specific reason to believe that such material was
presented to the grand jury. Instead, he gives us only the
general warning that "courts should be wary of accepting
prosecutorial assurances that constitutional violations have not
occurred" before the grand jury. Although Rostenkowski
obviously cannot be expected to know exactly what transpired
before the grand jury or what was presented to that body, he
must be able to provide, either from the allegations of the
indictment or from some other source, at least some reason to
believe that protected information was used to procure his
indictment. To give him a right to in camera review without any
particular reason apart from his status as a Member of Congress
and therefore a person protected by the Speech or Debate Clause
would completely disregard the "long-established policy" in
favor of grand jury secrecy, see Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v.
United States, 360 U.S. 395, 399 (1959), and would fail to
strike an appropriate (indeed any) balance between the grand
jury's "functional independence from the Judicial Branch,"
United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 48 (1992), and a
Congressman's right to be free from prosecution for his
legislative acts. Lacking any reason to think that prohibited
material was submitted to the grand jury, we have no reason to
believe that the district court's denial of his motion was in
error, and we affirm that decision.

 IV. Conclusion

 We remand this case to the district court with instructions to
consider in the first instance the impact of Hubbard upon Counts
Seven, Nine, Eleven, Fourteen, Fifteen, and Seventeen of the
indictment; and in further proceedings to disregard the
allegations of the indictment that we have determined are non-
justiciable under the doctrine of the separation of powers and
the Rulemaking Clause. In all other respects, we affirm the
orders of the district court.

 So ordered.

<P><B>LEGAL TIMES SEPTEMBER 4, 1995</B></P>

<P><B>INTERVIEW</B> </P>

<P><B>Reed Hundt Picks His Battles</B> </P>

<P>Juggling the deregulatory zeal of the Republican-dominated 104th Congress and the ongoing, massive convergence of telecommunications technologies and companies, Reed Hundt, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, faces an unusual balancing act. </P>

<P>With influential Washington think tanks such as the Progress & Freedom Foundation clamoring for the agency's abolition, Hundt has the unenviable task of explaining why federal regulation of the industry is still necessary. </P>

<P>At the same time, he and his agency stand as referee in a clash of the telecom titans, a clash that has already begun but will undoubtedly accelerate if and when far-reaching telecommunications reform legislation, passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives, gets the final nod from Congress and President Bill Clinton. </P>

<P>In an interview with Legal Times, Hundt, a boyhood friend of Vice President Albert Gore Jr. and a former partner in the D.C. office of Los Angeles' Latham & Watkins, spoke out about the continued need for the FCC as a guardian of the public interest and a champion of competition in the communications sector. Critical both of traditional regulatory models and of conservative plans to wipe out or radically scale back the FCC, Hundt bemoaned the years of neglect that have left the agency's public interest mandate badly in need of resuscitation. And he proposed making the public interest a central organizing principle of a new, more streamlined commission. </P>

<P>From his spacious but modestly decorated eighth floor offices at the FCC's M Street headquarters in Northwest Washington, Hundt also described the FCC's unfortunate history of being held captive to the businesses it regulates. He decried 10 years of delays in telecommunications reform legislation. He trumpeted commission plans to force broadcasters to increase educational programming and ensure that the new generation of digital television includes educational broadcasting. And he came down against the proposal by Sen. J. James Exon (D-Neb.) to restrict obscenity on the Internet, endorsing instead a House -passed amendment, sponsored by Reps. Christopher Cox (R-Calif.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.)_that explicitly denies the FCC any jurisdiction over online content. </P>

<P>But on one of the most pressing topics of the day, giant media mergers and the FCC's role in policing them, Hundt was conspicuously silent. A spokesman responding to a follow-up request to discuss the subject said Hundt would not comment on the recent spate of mergers because even a general statement could be seen to "prejudge any of the matters that might be submitted for approval." </P>

<P>What follows are excerpts from the Aug. 29 interview, which was conducted by Reporter Benjamin Wittes. </P>

<P>Legal Times: If you had to identify the things that you've done here that you're most proud of and the things that are most urgent that you would like to do, what would they be? </P>

<P>Hundt: There's three things. First of all, we need to clarify what it means to talk about the public interest in telecommunications. We need to define it with specificity, meaning that we have to make sure that advocating the public interest is not some grand hoax that we perpetrate on the American public or a kind of secret do-si-do dance that we do with business. We need to make sure that it generates deliverables_real services and products that serve the public. </P>

<P>The second thing is that we need to not only talk the competition talk but we need to walk the competition walk_meaning that we need to apply sound antitrust principles to all of our analysis, use economics, and come up with policy conclusions that further a real competition model. That's why we needed to kill prime-time access rules [under which network affiliates had to carry minimum quantities of nonnetwork programming during prime time]. That was totally inconsistent with any concept of fair, evenhanded competition. </P>

<P>That's why we needed to auction [off spectrum for] PCS [personal communications systems] . . . so that we would have at least five or seven different competitors in global communications. </P>

<P>Historically, the commission would have just picked one or two winners. . . . It would have tilted in favor of one business at the expense of another. It would have done this at the behest of well-heeled lawyers and lobbyists who are constantly packing our hallways here. It's time to get rid of the old regime of picking winners and playing favorites and rewarding friends, and get to the pure competition model. </P>

<P>And the third thing we have to do is trim down the agency. We have to get smarter with communications technology. We have to be open to the public, such as on the Internet. We have to reallocate our resources in an era of shrinking resources. We have to close offices where automation can replace people. We need to take the pain that goes with that. We need to beef up our economists and lawyers and accountants and statisticians and industry analysis, so that we understand what we're doing on our policy issues. That requires a lot of change in the organization. It's long overdue. It's very painful. It's not enjoyable to have [reductions in force], but it's past time to do this. </P>

<P>Legal Times: [I]n the past six months, it has repeatedly come up in public policy forums whether there should even be an FCC. A number of public policy organizations and congressional conservatives have suggested either eliminating the agency or radically scaling it back. At a time when everybody accepts the premise of increased competition, what is the role of a federal regulatory agency in the telecommunications field? </P>

<P>Hundt: Our No. 1 role is that we are the principal advocate of the public interest in the communications sector. If you think that the public property of the airwaves should be used for any public purpose, you need to have a public agency and an advocate of the public press for that purpose. That's the FCC. </P>

<P>If you believe, as the inaptly named Progress & Freedom Foundation believes, that there is no public use that's appropriate for the airwaves, that you ought to totally privatize the airwaves, then it follows that you don't need any FCC to be dedicated to that mission. If that's your philosophy, you probably believe we ought to privatize the Grand Canyon; you probably believe that we ought to have no government whatsoever; you probably think that we ought to get rid of the Department of Education and give everybody a voucher so that they can create home schools or charter schools. That's a philosophy, but it's not what most Americans want, and it's not what Congress has asked us to do. </P>

<P>Number two, only complete ignorance of the history of business and antitrust law could cause anyone to believe that simply stating that you want competition is the way you get competition. Saying that you're for competition means that you then have to commit an agency of the communications sector_or some other agency of some other sector_to actually drafting and implementing the blueprint for how you get to competition. </P>

<P>Because we don't have a lot of competition in communications right now. We're not writing on a blank slate. We're talking about introducing competition in markets that are dominated by well-muscled, heavily larded monopolies. They need to be subjected to fair rules of competition so that new entries have a chance. </P>

<P>Now let me just say, there are people who fool themselves into believing that the communications sector is so inherently dynamic that no rules whatsoever will give you fair competition. But nobody in the business thinks that. I do think that legislative and administrative delays in progress to competition are inexcusable. </P>

<P>Legal Times: Are you referring now to the telecommunications bill? </P>

<P>Hundt: I'm referring to the last 10 years of efforts in Congress to try to get a law . . . [and] efforts at the FCC to try to promote competition. We have to recognize that we need no-excuses regulation, meaning that the regulators should provide no excuses for the business people. What we should provide are a set of fair rules of competition. </P>

<P>Legal Times: I want to go back to your point about the public interest. One of the comments that [former FCC official] Peter Pitsch [who helped prepare the Progress & Freedom Foundation's report] made was that he really didn't believe in the public interest. . . . He thought that the term was so vague as to be meaningless. </P>

<P>Hundt: Peter Pitsch helped make it vague. Peter Pitsch was here at the FCC when the public interest was gutted of all meaning and the law was distorted into a play on words, in which my friend and former colleague, [former FCC Chairman] Mark Fowler said, "The public interest isn't anything other than whatever interests the public." And then he went on to suggest that if the public watches what's on TV, then that demonstrates that what's on TV is in the public interest. It's a circularity that was elevated by the FCC to a principle of law and regulatory philosophy. But I don't agree with that, and I don't think that's the law. </P>

<P>This is a principal difference between me and those administrations. My view is that the problem with the phrase, public interest, convenience, and necessity, [from] the 1934 Communications Act is not that it inevitably has no meaning, but rather that for 60 years, the commission has done everything it can to strip that phrase of all the potential meaning that it could have. </P>

<P>Legal Times: In a concrete way, what is the potential meaning that it could have? What are some real-world examples of the FCC protecting the public interest? </P>

<P>Hundt: A real-world example could be that we would say to all people who hold on a temporary basis_for free_broadcast TV licenses the following: In order to keep this license, you must deliver five hours of children's educational TV in each market per week. You don't have to show all of it yourself; you can find someone else who will carry some of it_make some of it tradable. That way [for-profit broadcasters] would help fund [the Public Broadcasting Service]. We don't want to worry about the definition [of educational programming]. We're willing to accept the industry's suggested definition, which happens to be extant right now. . . . </P>

<P>It's very workable. We're willing to have you be held accountable by your local communities as to your performance toward that definition, and let the complaint process generate whatever objections there are. We're willing to let you teach on educational TV anything you want_creationism or evolution_the government won't get involved. We won't say anything about the substance; you'll have complete First Amendment rights as to what you utter. But you will deliver this product in concrete, specific, real amounts to parents and children in your market. And furthermore, we could tell them quite reasonably to tell parents when the shows are, so you can find it in the TV guide, which you cannot do now in the avalanche of entertainment and infotainment that you receive over the air. </P>

<P>Now if we did this, it is just a plain fact that millions of American homes and tens of millions of American children would get something they don't now get. I'm not saying it necessarily would be as popular as "Seinfeld." That's not the point. The point is not that broadcasters should get as rich as they possibly can on each and every half hour, but rather that if you believe in the public interest, in fair, concrete, manageable obligations, it's a perfectly reasonable way to go for the country. </P>

<P>Legal Times: Where are the children's television_the educational television_rules now? </P>

<P>Hundt: Comments are going to be due in the middle of October, reply comments in the middle of November. . . . Congress underscored the importance of children's educational and informational programming by passing a whole separate law in 1990. . . . </P>

<P>It's right and proper to continue to examine here at the FCC what should constitute a public interest obligation. It could and should be an evolving concept. </P>

<P>Instead, it has devolved into absolute meaninglessness in two respects: First, the FCC has presided, over the last 15 to 20 years, in gutting any sense of obligation. So the broadcasters out there feel_with some justice_that the FCC will never ask them, as the rules now stand, to deliver any public interest programming_or at least [will] not care if they fail to do it. The proof of that is that in the last 15 years, the total number of TV licenses that have been lost in proceedings at the FCC because of a failure to meet the public interest obligation is zero. </P>

<P>Legal Times: Should that number go up? </P>

<P>Hundt: Well, let me put it this way: Intuitively, it's pretty hard for anyone to believe that the reason it's zero is because TV has gotten better at delivering public interest programming over the last 15 years. The reason it has gone to zero is because the FCC adopted the philosophy that I earlier talked about that basically said in transparent terms_and I think in terms inconsistent with the 1934 Communications Act and the Children's Television Act_the FCC basically said, "Do anything you like, and we'll bless it." Well, that's the first reason that the public interest obligation has become, in effect, in legal terms, a sad joke. </P>

<P>The second reason why this obligation has failed to develop as it should have into concrete, real, specific deliverables to the American people, is that before an era of gutting the standard of any possibility of enforcement, the FCC was too content with a broad, vague, ambiguous standard. </P>

<P>This takes you back to a different philosophy . . . or the notion that the FCC chairman would be the national nanny or the occupant of a bully pulpit. That's the notion that there's some vague public interest standard, and the chairman of the FCC or the commission as a whole will let you know what it is from time to time. And you better watch out because if they raise their eyebrows or if they're a little unhappy, you better mend your ways_mend your programming and mend your ways. </P>

<P>Well, that concept, number one, was doomed not to work because it fundamentally rested on a concept of bluffing_as in poker_where the FCC would never, in fact, deal itself any cards. Because you never would, in fact, enforce anything. Secondly, that concept, that philosophy, I think we can now see in retrospect, was antithetical to any notion of First Amendment values. Nothing could be more chilling for freedom of speech for broadcasters than having an FCC that threatened to punish them by the death penalty of taking away their licenses but without saying how, when, or why the death penalty would ever be meted out. </P>

<P>Legal Times: At the same time as there have been calls for radical reform of the agency, the House and Senate have both passed bills that seem to invest a lot of authority in the agency in terms of managing the transition to competition. It seems to me like there's a bit of doubletalk there. On the one hand they say this is an overzealous regulatory agency, on the other hand [they say] let's give it the following new responsibilities. I'm wondering whether that has caused problems for you guys in terms of planning and trying to figure out what you're going to look like in the next few years. </P>

<P>Hundt: I think it's important to pick out from the not always harmonious voices of congressional views a couple of main themes and listen to them. </P>

<P>First, Congress is saying, in a variety of different ways, "FCC, we want you to really commit to competition from here on out. We don't want you to just talk about it but to cut special deals for favorite parties and delay proceedings that would permit people to enter markets. We want you to be real about it." </P>

<P>I think we should listen to that; I think we should adhere to that. That's why I believe so strongly that we should simplify licenses_the process of getting licenses to use the spectrum_by going to auctions wherever and whenever possible. </P>

<P>Now, I have been arguing with a couple of my colleagues here, who have opposed me on a couple of auction proceedings. But I think that auctions are in sync with what Congress is telling us to do generally about aggressively moving to competition. And I'm going to keep arguing for auctions. </P>

<P>Second, Congress is saying to us, "We want you to be as lean, efficient, and open to the American public as you possibly can be." I'm totally in agreement with that. I'm the first chairman to have a computer; I'm the first to send an e-mail. One of the happiest moments of my life was when I was able to announce that we'd gotten everybody at the FCC on the information highway. Instead of being shamefully out of touch with the very technologies that we're supposed to be talking about, working on, we at last are using them. </P>

<P>That's why we have to continue to close offices. And a couple of my colleagues disagree with me on this, but they're entitled to disagree. . . . </P>

<P>The third thing that Congress is saying to us is "Trust in markets; use economics. Trust in markets; they're going to work out." I'm totally in agreement. That is one of the reasons I've doubled the number of economists here. Not because I want them to spend their time counting beans and pushing columns of numbers left and right, but because I want them to advocate internally on each and every policy issue the view that economics is a sound discipline, that if you trust in markets, you're going to maximize consumer welfare, and efficiency gains are going to be tremendous. And on that subject, little by little, I think we're seeing a sea change in the agency's approach. </P>

<P>So I think a lot of the things_maybe the bulk of the things_that are being said in Congress today, I'm happy to be implementing. </P>

<P>There is one point of difference. There are people in Congress . . . who assert that there simply isn't any public interest in the communications sector. There we differ. . . . </P>

<P>Legal Times: I understand that the House bill and Senate bill are very different. But by and large, are you comfortable with the direction that the bills are going? </P>

<P>Hundt: Well, I think everyone on both sides of the aisle and people in the White House are very comfortable with the fundamental precept of the Senate bill and the House bill in this Congress_and with the Senate bill and the House bill in the previous Congress_which is that we should lower the barriers that prohibit entry of firms into other markets. There's really no question about that. </P>

<P>Second, there are a number of ways in which the Senate and House bills today do memorialize a commitment to the public interest, and I think everyone's comfortable with that. But there are also a number of major issues on which there is major disagreement_and on those issues, I think it's right for the FCC to not take sides but to wait and to commit to perform faithfully all the duties that Congress decides to give us, assuming that a bill does become law. </P>

<P>Legal Times: Have you made your views known on those specific issues to the administration? </P>

<P>Hundt: Let me put it this way: We have offered, in most cases quietly, our technical expertise to anybody_Republican or Democrat_who wants it. And we're still doing that. But nobody wants us to enlist on one side or the other of the partisan fights. We're not doing that. </P>

<P>Legal Times: On one specific matter, though, the two bills have a profoundly different view of the FCC's jurisdiction over content on the Internet. From the Exon bill in the Senate to the Cox/Wyden bill in the House, it runs, I think, about the gamut. </P>

<P>Hundt: Right. Well, on that one I have violated the self -imposed rule that I mentioned to you. And I have said that I personally_speaking very personally_I favor the Cox/Wyden approach. </P>

<P>Legal Times: You don't think that the FCC should have any jurisdiction over content, which is really what it says, right? </P>

<P>Hundt: No, I think that the Internet is a curious, strange, and incredibly important phenomenon. It does have dangerous implications. It also has numerous positive implications. But the Cox/Wyden approach would permit the country to cope with the downside. </P>

<P>Legal Times: [But] a lot of the things you said previously about the public interest with respect to educational television imply that in the broadcast media, the FCC ought to have a role in talking about content. . . . But why the discrepancy: no content regulation on the Internet but a role for the FCC in broadcasting? </P>

<P>Hundt: It's not about content; it's about the public interest. It's in the public interest to have a free over-the -air medium that delivers children educational TV, that provides a forum for political debate. We would be much healthier as a country . . . if political debates directed toward electing candidates could be conducted via broadcast and if candidates didn't have to pay for the time. We'd be much healthier as a country. </P>

<P>But when you turn to the Internet, I think the public interest goal is a different one. I think it is that there ought to be Internet access for every kid in every classroom and for every teacher in the country. And I think that the FCC ought to have that as a chief mission. I think we ought to accomplish that. I think as long as we're not focused on that, we're running the danger that the Internet will become the dividing line between the haves and the have-nots in our country. </P>

<P>Legal Times: What's the regulatory vehicle for ensuring access? </P>

<P>Hundt: Basically, I think we ought to use each and every tool we can find. For example, I think that telephone companies ought to be given incentives to provide Internet access. Cable companies ought to be given incentives to provide Internet access. I think that any tool we can find to get this done is a good one. Obviously, I prefer efficient market-based techniques. I prefer technology-neutral techniques. . . . </P>

<P>I think [universal Internet access] would revolutionize education. It could not possibly fail to achieve numerous successes, and the examples are already starting to pop up_test models that have already been run. Santa Clara, in California, has done this in a couple of schools; test scores go through the roof. Union City, New Jersey-Bell Atlantic test, scores are going through the roof. . . . There's only a handful of tests all over the country. But scores go right through the roof, class participation goes up, attendance goes up, dropout rate goes down. . . . </P>

<P>Legal Times: When you say incentives to provide access, are you talking about spectrum allocation? </P>

<P>Hundt: Well, we just signed Time Warner in something called the social contract (Legal Times is a Time Warner affiliate). The deal had many parts, but they lowered the price of basic cable; they agreed to provide connections to classrooms at cost; and they, in turn, are getting greater flexibility on price for enhanced basic. They're happy with the deal; we're happy with the deal. . . . We are working on similar ideas with other cable companies. That's an example, and there are other examples that you will see over the next three months. </P>

<P>Legal Times: I always hear about [high-definition television] and video dial tone, and sometimes I hear about them as examples of great opportunity for the FCC, and frequently I hear about them as FCC foul-ups over the last few years. I'm wondering if you can address them specifically. Was it a mistake to give away all the spectrum on HDTV? </P>

<P>Hundt: Well, we haven't given away any of the spectrum yet. The digital TV spectrum is the spectrum that lies in the gaps right now. In Washington, D.C., you have Channel 4, Channel 5, and Channel 7. The digital spectrum is in what would be Channel 6. It lies in the gaps; it can't be used now by analog broadcasters because of interference, but if they used digital technology, they could use it. By November of this year, the digital technology will be fully tested, complete, ready to roll after about a seven-year process conducted by a consortium of industries called the Grand Alliance. It's a fantastic technology. It can take one TV channel_6 megahertz_and get four or five signals out of it or one high-definition signal and maybe one other signal. </P>

<P>In other words, there's all kinds of flexibility available in terms of what can be transmitted digitally. </P>

<P>In the middle of October, we are expecting comments on our proposal, which is: Given the law the way it is written, shouldn't we give the digital spectrum to broadcasters for free, and shouldn't they, in return, make two promises to the American people? First, that they will, over time, return the analog spectrum and shut down the analog system, and second, that they will perform a variety of public interest obligations. </P>

<P>That's our proposal, given that the law precludes us from auctioning the spectrum. </P>

<P>Legal Times: And the law precludes that because . . . ? </P>

<P>Hundt: Because we're not permitted by law to auction any spectrum that's used for broadcast_free over-the-air broadcast. So Congress could change that law as part of the budget process, but that's not our issue. We'll do what Congress tells us. If they don't want it auctioned, we won't auction it. </P>

<P>But the important thing here is whether digital TV is going to be as good and bad as analog TV is_that is, as positive a force and also as mixed a blessing as analog TV is. Or do we have a chance to set up a system that is likely to maximize public interest benefits of free over-the-air television? And the fact is that we have a second chance to get this right, and the FCC is building on a history of failure and playing favorites and being overwhelmed by special pleading and intimidated by political pressure. </P>

<P>So we don't have a very good track record to suggest that we can get this right. But I believe that this commission has in it commissioners and able people on the staff who will get this right. And furthermore, we are very much more likely to get this right if the American people know what's going on, and there's an alertness to the fact that we're going to be defining in the next year the history of TV in the 21st century. </P>

<P>Legal Times: If one of the premises of all of this is that you're having a convergence of technology because all digital media is essentially the same, the FCC is still divided into six bureaus that are organized along traditional broadcast lines, I'm wondering, can we expect an internal reform of the bureau system to parallel . . . the convergence of the technologies? </P>

<P>Hundt: Well, in some out year, it's probably right for the FCC to be organized by functions instead of by industry, namely enforcement, licensing, and policy. However, that kind of organization, that kind of change in an organization is incredibly disruptive and incredibly time-consuming. And that is just going to have to wait for an out year. I don't know when because, frankly, we don't have the time to spare to make that kind of massive change. </P>

UNITED STATES SENATE
SELECT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS
      
HART SENATE OFFICE BUILDING, ROOM 270
SECOND AND CONSTITUTION AVENUE, NE.
WASHINGTON, DC 20510 6425
TELEPHONE (202) 224-2981


RESOLUTION FOR INVESTIGATION

     Whereas, the Select Committee on Ethics on December 1,
1992, initiated a Preliminary Inquiry (hereafter "Inquiry")
into allegations of sexual misconduct by Senator Bob
Packwood, and subsequently, on February 4, 1993, expanded
the scope of its Inquiry to include allegations of attempts
to intimidate and discredit the alleged victims, and misuse
of official staff in attempts to intimidate and discredit,
and notified Senator Packwood of such actions; and

   Whereas, on December 15, 1993, in light of sworn
testimony that Senator Packwood may have altered evidence
relevant to the Committee's Inquiry, the Chairman and
Vice-Chairman determined as an inherent part of its Inquiry
to inquire into the integrity of evidence sought by the
Committee and into any information that anyone may have
endeavored to obstruct its Inquiry, and notified Senator
Packwood of such action; and

   Whereas, on May 11, 1994, upon completion of the
Committee staff's review of Senator Packwood's typewritten
diaries, the Committee expanded its Inquiry again to include
additional areas of potential misconduct by Senator
Packwood, including solicitation of financial support for
his spouse from persons with an interest in legislation, in
exchange, gratitude, or recognition for his official acts;

   Whereas, the Committee staff has conducted the Inquiry
under the direction of the Members of the Committee; and

   Whereas, the Committee has received the Report of its
staff relating to its Inquiry concerning Senator Packwood;
and

   Whereas, on the basis of evidence received during the
Inquiry, there are possible violations within the
Committee's jurisdiction as contemplated in Section 2(a)(1)
of S. Res. 338, 88th Congress, as amended:

   It is therefore Resolved:

   I.  That the Committee makes the following determinations
regarding the matters set forth above:

        (a)  With respect to sexual misconduct, the
Committee has carefully considered evidence, including sworn
testimony, witness interviews, and documentary evidence,
relating to the following allegations:

        (1)  That in 1990, in his Senate office in
Washington, D.C., Senator Packwood grabbed a staff member
by the shoulders and kissed her on the lips;

        (2)  That in 1985, at a function in Bend, Oregon,
Senator Packwood fondled a campaign worker as they danced.
Later that year, in Eugene, Oregon, in saying goodnight and
thank you to her, Senator Packwood grabbed the campaign
worker's face with his hands, pulled her towards him, and
kissed her on the mouth, forcing his tongue into her mouth;

        (3)  That in 1981 or 1982, in his Senate office in
Washington, D.C., Senator Packwood squeezed the arms of a
lobbyist, leaned over and kissed her on the mouth;

        (4)  That in 1981, in the basement of the Capitol,
Senator Packwood walked a former staff assistant into a
room, where he grabbed her with both hands in her hair and
kissed her, forcing his tongue into her mouth;

        (5)  That in 1980, in a parking lot in Eugene,
Oregon, Senator Packwood pulled a campaign worker toward
him, put his arms around her, and kissed her, forcing his
tongue in her mouth; he also invited her to his motel room;

        (6)  That in 1980 or early 1981, at a hotel in
Portland, Oregon, on two separate occasions, Senator
Packwood kissed a desk clerk who worked for the hotel;

        (7)  That in 1980, in his Senate office in
Washington, D.C., Senator Packwood grabbed a staff member by
the shoulders, pushed her down on a couch, and kissed her on
the lips; the staff member tried several times to get up,
but Senator Packwood repeatedly pushed her back on the
couch;

        (8)  That in 1979, Senator Packwood walked into the
office of another Senator in Washington, D.C., started
talking with a staff member, and suddenly leaned down and
kissed the staff member on the lips;

        (9)  That in 1977, in an elevator in the Capitol,
and on numerous occasions, Senator Packwood grabbed the
elevator operator by the shoulders, pushed her to the wall
of the elevator and kissed her on the lips.  Senator
Packwood also came to this person's home, kissed her, and
asked her to make love with him;

        (10)  That in 1977, in a motel room while attending
the Dorchester Conference in coastal Oregon, Senator
Packwood grabbed a prospective employee by her shoulders,
pulled her to him, and kissed her;

        (11)  That in 1975, in his Senate office in
Washington, D.C., Senator Packwood grabbed the staff
assistant referred to in (4), pinned her against a wall or
desk, held her hair with one hand, bending her head
backwards, fondling her with his other hand, and kissed her,
forcing his tongue into her mouth;

        (12)  That in 1975, in his Senate office in
Washington, D.C., Senator Packwood grabbed a staff assistant
around her shoulders, held her tightly while pressing his
body into hers, and kissed her on the mouth;

        (13)  That in the early 1970's, in his Senate office
in Portland, Oregon, Senator Packwood chased a staff
assistant around a desk;

        (14)  That in 1970, in a hotel restaurant in
Portland, Oregon, Senator Packwood ran his hand up the leg
of a dining room hostess, and touched her crotch area;

        (15)  That in 1970, in his Senate office in
Washington, D.C., Senator Packwood grabbed a staff member by
the shoulders and kissed her on the mouth;

        (16)  That in 1969, in his Senate office in
Washington, D.C., Senator Packwood made suggestive comments
to a prospective employee;

        (17)  That in 1969, at his home, Senator Packwood
grabbed an employee of another Senator who was babysitting
for him, rubbed her shoulders and back, and kissed her on
the mouth. He also put his arm around her and touched her
leg as he drove her home;

        (18)  That in 1969, in his Senate office in
Portland, Oregon, Senator Packwood grabbed a staff worker,
stood on her feet, grabbed her hair, forcibly pulled her
head back, and kissed her on the mouth, forcing his tongue
into her mouth.  Senator Packwood also reached under her
skirt and grabbed at her undergarments. Based upon the
Committee's consideration of evidence related to each of
these allegations, the Committee finds that there is
substantial credible evidence that provides substantial
cause for the Committee to conclude that violations within
the Committee's jurisdiction as contemplated in Section
2(a)(1) of S. Res. 338, 88th Congress, as amended, may have
occurred; to wit, that Senator Packwood may have abused his
United States Senate Office by improper conduct which has
brought discredit upon the United States Senate, by engaging
in a pattern of sexual misconduct between 1969 and 1990.

   Notwithstanding this conclusion, for purposes of making a
determination at the end of its Investigation with regard to
a possible pattern of conduct involving sexual misconduct,
some Members of the Committee have serious concerns about
the weight, if any, that should be accorded to evidence of
conduct alleged to have occurred prior to 1976, the year in
which the federal court recognized quid pro quo sexual
harassment as discrimination under the Civil Rights Act, and
the Senate passed a resolution prohibiting sex
discrimination in the United States Senate, and taking into
account the age of the allegations.

   (b)  With respect to the Committee's inherent
responsibility to inquire into the integrity of the evidence
sought by the Committee as part of its Inquiry, the
Committee finds, within the meaning of Section 2(a)(1) of S.
Res. 338, 88th Congress, as amended, that there is
substantial credible evidence that provides substantial
cause for the Committee to conclude that improper conduct
reflecting upon the Senate, and/or possible violations of
federal law, i.e., Title 18, United States Code, Section
1505, may have occurred.  To wit:

   Between some time in December 1992 and some time in
November 1993, Senator Packwood intentionally altered diary
materials that he knew or should have known the Committee
had sought or would likely seek as part of its Preliminary
Inquiry begun on December 1, 1992.

   (c)  With respect to possible solicitation of financial
support for his spouse from persons with an interest in
legislation, the Committee has carefully considered
evidence, including sworn testimony and documentary
evidence, relating to Senator Packwood's contacts with the
following persons:

        (1)  A registered foreign agent representing a
client who had particular interests before the Committee on
Finance and the Committee on Commerce, Science and
Transportation;

        (2)  A businessman who had. particular interests
before the Committee on Commerce, Science and
Transportation;

        (3)  A businessman who had particular interests
before the Committee on Finance and the Committee on
Commerce, Science and Transportation;

        (4)  A registered lobbyist: representing clients who
had particular interests before the Committee on Finance and
the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation;

        (5)  A registered lobbyist representing a client who
had particular interests before the Committee on Finance.

   Based upon the Committee's consideration of this
evidence, the Committee finds that there is substantial
credible evidence that provides substantial cause for the
Committee to conclude that violations within the Committee's
jurisdiction as contemplated in Section 2(a)(1) of S. Res.
338, 88th Congress, as amended, may have occurred, to wit:
Senator Packwood may have abused his United States Senate
Office through improper conduct which has brought discredit
upon the United States Senate by inappropriately linking
personal financial gain to his official position in that he
solicited or otherwise encouraged offers of financial
assistance from persons who had a particular interest in
legislation or issues that Senator Packwood could influence.

   II.  That the Committee, pursuant to Committee
Supplementary Procedural Rules 3(d)(5) and 4(f)(4), shall
proceed to an Investigation under Committee Supplementary
Procedural Rule 5; and

   III.  That Senator Packwood shall be given timely written
notice of this Resolution and the evidence supporting it,
and informed of a respondent's rights pursuant to the Rules
of the Committee.

COMMITTEE'S RESOLUTION


REPORT OF SENATE ETHICS COUNSEL


I.   INTRODUCTION

     Senate Ethics Counsel submits this Report in the matter
of Senator Bob Packwood pursuant to Rule 5(f)(1) of the
Supplementary Procedural Rules of the United States Senate
Select Committee on Ethics (the Committee).  This Report
contains findings based upon the evidence gathered during
the course of the Committee's proceedings in this matter.

   Initially, the Report reviews the procedural background
of the matters which are the subject of the Committee's
Investigation.  The Report then addresses the scope of the
Committee's authority to investigate and sanction misconduct
of Members, and discusses Senate precedents.

   The Report then discusses in detail the evidence gathered
by the Committee with respect to each of the matters under
Investigation.  Based upon this evidence, Counsel makes
findings of improper conduct with respect to each of the
three charges contained in the Committee's Resolution of May
16, 1995.


II.  PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

   A.   Sexual Misconduct

         1.   Origin of Allegations

   On November 22, 1992, the Washington Post published a
story detailing allegations against Senator Packwood of
sexual harassment and misconduct by Senator Packwood by
seven women, five of whom were named in the article, and two
of whom were anonymous .

   By a letter received at the Committee November 30, 1992,
the Women's Equal Rights Legal Defense and Education Fund
(WERLDEF), filed a complaint against Senator Packwood, and
requested an investigation of the sexual harassment and
misconduct allegations that had been made against him.  By
letter dated December 1, 1992, the Committee notified
Senator Packwood of the complaint, and that the Committee
had decided to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the
allegations.

   On December 10, 1992, Senator Packwood held a press
conference, in which he read a statement saying, inter alia,
that he took full responsibility for his conduct, that all
of his past record was clouded because of incidents in which
his actions were unwelcomed and offensive to the women
involved, and justifiably so; that his past actions were not
just inappropriate, that what he had done was not just
stupid or boorish, but his actions were just plain wrong.
He stated that he "didn't get it", but that he did now.
Without getting into specific allegations, he admitted his
mistake, and apologized to the women involved. [fn 1]

   On December 21, 1992, the Committee received a sworn
complaint, in which a woman alleged that Senator Packwood
had made an improper advance toward her, and asked that the
Committee investigate his behavior.  Her attorney also
requested the Committee to conduct an inquiry into the
pattern of Senator Packwood's conduct over a period of years
with regard to other women he Committee received numerous
letters from other groups and private citizens urging that
the Committee investigate the allegations of sexual
harassment and misconduct. 

        On February 4, 1993, the Committee announced that it
was expanding the scope of its inquiry to include
allegations of attempts to intimidate and discredit the
alleged victims, and misuse of official staff in attempts to
intimidate and discredit

         2.   How the Investigation was Conducted

   The staff took sworn depositions or statements from
twenty- two women who made allegations of sexual harassment
or misconduct against Senator Packwood.  The staff also
interviewed or deposed witnesses who corroborated the
allegations made by some of the women accusers, by virtue of
the fact that the women had told them about the incident,
although not always in great detail, either shortly after it
occurred, or well before the allegations were published by
the Post.

   The staff also mailed a letter and questionnaire to 293
female former Packwood staff members, asking if they had
information relevant to the Committee's inquiry.  194
questionnaires were returned. [fn 2] 39 signed returned
receipt cards were returned, but no corresponding
questionnaires were returned.[fn 3]  47 of the
questionnaires were returned as undeliverable.[fn 4]  Thus,
out of the 293 questionnaires originally sent, 280 have been
accounted for, either by the questionnaire being returned,
by the return receipt card being returned, indicating that
the questionnaire was delivered but the addressee did not
wish to respond, or by the questionnaire being returned as
undeliverable.

   The bulk of the persons responding to the questionnaire
(approximately 122) had no relevant information [fn 5];
approximately 34 did not wish to become involved in the
Committee's inquiry. [fn 6]  Approximately 35 women
responded that they had relevant information; most of these
women provided (by a written statement accompanying their
questionnaire, by a telephone interview, or both) statements
of support for the Senator, generally stating that they had
a wonderful experience working for him, that they had
neither experienced nor heard of any type of sexual
misconduct by the Senator, and that they viewed the Senator
as a gentleman who was genuinely interested in advancing
women and women's causes.  A few of these women provided
information about misconduct involving women who have not
chosen to come forward, some of which corroborated
information the staff had already uncovered.  Two persons
who responded to the Committee's questionnaire have come
forward with allegations of sexual misconduct.

   The staff also attempted to contact and interview or
depose every person who the staff had reason to believe, by
virtue of other testimony or information, might have
knowledge either implicating Senator Packwood in unwanted
sexual behavior toward his staff, or tending to exonerate
him of such accusations.

        The staff also took the depositions of Jack Faust,
Senator Packwood's longtime friend, campaign adviser, and
attorney, and Elaine Franklin, Senator Packwood's chief of
staff.

   Senator Packwood was served with two separate document
requests, on March 29 and July 16, 1993, asking for
virtually every document that dealt with the allegations of
sexual misconduct, or the women who were making the
allegations.  His chief of staff, Elaine Franklin, was also
served with a document request, and Jack Faust was served
with a subpoena for documents.

   Senator Packwood appeared for his deposition by the
Committee staff on Tuesday, October 5, 1993.  During
questioning by the staff, Senator Packwood testified that he
had kept detailed diaries from the time he had taken office,
which he dictated and then had transcribed by a staff
member.  Senator Packwood testified that he had reviewed
some portions of the diaries and scanned others, and that
the diaries contained some entries that were relevant to the
complaints that had been made against him. [fn 7]

   At that point, the deposition was halted.  An agreement
was reached for review of the diaries by Committee counsel
and counsel immediately began that review.  After counsel
discovered entries in the diaries that appeared to implicate
Senator Packwood in other conduct that was arguably
improper, Senator Packwood refused to allow further review
of his diaries.  The Committee voted unanimously to subpoena
Senator Packwood for production of his diaries.  When he did
not comply, the Committee introduced a resolution on the
floor of the Senate to authorize the Senate legal counsel to
file suit in Federal District Court to enforce the subpoena.
The resolution was approved by a vote of 94 to 6.

   The Committee's application to enforce the subpoena was
filed on November 22, 1993, and was heard by the Hon. Thomas
Penfield Jackson on December 16, 1993.  On January 24, 1994,
Judge Jackson granted the Committee's application, and after
consulting with the parties, on February 4, 1994,
established guidelines for the Committee's review of the
diaries.  The Committee received Senator Packwood's diary
transcripts from March 1994 through April 1994, and the
diary tapes from October 1994 through February 1995.
Senator Packwood's deposition was concluded in January 1995.

   B.   Alteration of Evidence

     1.   The Committee's Pursuit of the Diaries

         a.   The Committee's Document Requests

      The two document requests issued to Senator Packwood
by the Committee in March and July 1993 required him to
produce all documents of any kind, including personal
records, regarding, related to, communicating with, or
memorializing communications with a wide range of identified
individuals, or referring or relating to a set of identified
events, within the scope of the Committee's inquiry.  The
second request specifically stated that [t]he Committee
expects that you will conduct a reasonable and thorough
search of your Senate office files, your personal files,
campaign committee files, and other files that are within
your possession, custody, and control, or otherwise would be
available to you, in order . . . to ensure full compliance"
with the Committee's document requests.

   As defined in the requests, the word "document" included
any information stored on audio or videotape, or by any
other electromagnetic or electronic means.

   The existence of diaries kept by Senator Packwood was
known to the staff, through a press report and a reference
to them in another document produced by Senator Packwood.
Although Senator Packwood produced a number of documents
pursuant to these requests, he produced no portions of his
diaries.  Further, although the Senator informed the
Committee that he was asserting the attorney-client or
work-product privilege with respect to the production of
more than 100 documents and disclosed the existence of the
documents that he was withholding on that ground, the
Senator never disclosed that he was withholding, or
asserting a privilege from producing, diaries responsive to
the Committee's document requests. [fn 8]

   The staff assumed in good faith that Senator Packwood had
complied with the two document requests, and had identified
all material that was responsive to the Committee's
requests, either by turning it over to the Committee, or
disclosing its existence but withholding it on grounds of
privilege.  Because no entries from Senator Packwood's
diaries were ever produced, nor was the Committee advised
that Senator Packwood was withholding them on the basis of
any privilege, the staff assumed that the diaries contained
no material responsive to the Committee's document requests.

         b.   The Committee Learns of the Existence of
Relevant Diary Entries

   At his first deposition in October 1993, Senator Packwood
testified under oath that he had scanned more than ten years
of his diaries in connection with the Committee's inquiry,
and that his diaries contained materials concerning persons
and events that were the subject of the Committee's inquiry.
He gave no explanation for his failure to produce these
materials in response to the Committee's request, despite
the fact that he testified that they included relevant
information. [fn 9]

   At that point, the staff requested that Senator Packwood
provide his diaries to the Committee 80 that the staff could
examine them before completing his deposition.  The staff
began negotiations with Senator Packwood's attorneys for
access to the diaries.  The Committee agreed to allow
Senator Packwood to produce diaries covering specific years
(the last period of which terminated with the then-present
date, October 6, 1993), and to mask with opaque tape
passages covered by the attorney-client privilege, the
physician-patient privilege, or that referred solely to
personal, private family matters.  The Committee permitted
Senator Packwood to mask entries dealing with personal,
private family matters, despite the fact that such entries
were not protected by any recognized evidentiary privilege,
to accommodate Senator Packwood's concerns about the private
nature of diary entries about his family.  However, the
Committee did not accede to Senator Packwood's request that
he be allowed to mask entries dealing with consensual sexual
relationships, because such matters would likely bear on the
potential bias of witnesses before the Committee, and
because consent was at the heart of the issues before the
Committee.  Senator Packwood's attorney specifically advised
the staff that the Senator had agreed to produce his diaries
under these conditions.

   Before the staff began reviewing the diaries, Senator
Packwood's attorneys asked whether the staff would agree
that if, while reviewing the diaries, the staff identified
passages raising issues within the Committee's jurisdiction,
but beyond the scope of its inquiry into alleged sexual
misconduct and witness intimidation, the staff would not
require copies of those entries, but would set aside those
additional issues for later consideration.  The staff
refused to make such a commitment.

   On October 12, 1993, Senator Packwood began providing his
masked diaries for review.[fn 10]  Over the next four days,
four Committee counsel reviewed an estimated 3,000 to 4,000
pages spanning 1969 through 1983, and identified 115 pages
or portions of pages that contained relevant material.
Senator Packwood provided photocopies of those pages to the
Committee.

   As agreed, the diaries were reviewed by the staff only in
the presence of Senator Packwood's attorneys.  Staff did not
take any notes, make any copies, or take custody of any of
the diaries.  Staff marked for photocopying those entries it
determined had some relevance to the Committee's inquiry,
with the understanding that Senator Packwood's attorneys
would provide copies of these passages.  As agreed, if there
were disputes about the relevance of any particular passages
that the staff requested be photocopied, which could not be
resolved at the staff level, Senator Packwood had the right
to press his objection before the Committee leadership, and
ultimately before the full Committee, for a ruling.

   On October 14, while the staff continued to review the
diaries, Senator Packwood requested, by way of a letter
addressed to the Committee, that he be allowed to mask
entries relating to his consensual intimate activities
during the years since 1989. He suggested that Kenneth Starr
be retained to review any such masking to ensure that it
dealt only with consensual activity. The Committee rejected
Senator Packwood's request, because such material could be
probative of potential witness bias and could bear directly
on one of the key factual issues that the Committee would
ultimately need to resolve, namely, whether particular
conduct was or was not consensual.  Senator Packwood
continued to produce his diaries in accordance with the
previous agreement.

   Committee counsel continued to review Senator Packwood's
diaries over the weekend of October 16 and 17, examining an
additional estimated 1,000 to 2,000 pages, and marking
approximately 170 pages or portions of pages for
photocopying. [fn 11]


    c.   The Committee's Review of the Diaries Comes to a
Halt

    On Sunday, October 17, Committee counsel came across two
passages from 1989 that indicated possible misconduct in
areas unrelated to the Committee's pending inquiry into
sexual misconduct and witness intimidation.

   These entries raised questions whether Senator Packwood
may have improperly solicited financial support for his wife
from individuals with interests in legislation and whether
such solicitations may have been linked to his performance
of official acts.  The entries implicated possible
violations of federal laws, as well as rules and standards
of the Senate.

   These entries appeared in the diaries on November 3 and
November 6, 1989.  At that time, as reflected in the
diaries, Senator Packwood was contemplating divorce from his
wife, and was worried about the amount of support that he
would have to pay as part of the divorce settlement.  The
November 3 entry stated that Senator Packwood had met with
Steve Saunders, and had asked him to put the Senator's wife
on "retainer" for $7500 per year; the individual agreed,
expressing relief that the figure was an annual, and not a
monthly, amount.  The entry also reflects that Senator
Packwood had approached two other individuals with similar
requests.

   A diary entry on November 6, 1989, three days after the
meeting with Steve Saunders, reflected that Senator Packwood
attended a meeting or hearing of the Senate Committee on
Finance, of which Senator Packwood was the ranking
Republican member. Senator Packwood recorded that he had
raised questions or suggested legislative language of some
sort for Mr. Saunders.

   Senator Packwood's handwritten calendars, which he turned
over to the Committee after their existence was discovered
during his deposition, also confirm the November 3 meeting
with Mr. Saunders, and that on November 6, Senator Packwood
went to "Finance for Saunders."

   Committee counsel marked these entries in the diary for
photocopying, and on October 18, Victor Baird, Chief Counsel
for the Committee, advised the Committee leadership of the
discovery of the entries

    On Monday, October 18, Senator Packwood's attorney
failed to deliver the next series of diaries for review [fn
12] under the agreement.  When Victor Baird inquired of
Senator Packwood's attorney when the diaries would arrive,
Senator Packwood's attorney expressed concern over one of
the two passages that had been marked for photocopying,
claiming that it was not relevant to the Committee's
inquiry, and asking why it had been marked. He was advised
that the entry raised new issues of potential misconduct,
and was cited to specific laws, Senate rules, and standards
that might apply.  The Senator's attorney asked if these new
issues could be treated as a separate matter, and not acted
upon until the Committee's current preliminary inquiry was
concluded.  Mr. Baird informed him that he could not agree
to that, and that it was the Committee's decision as to
whether any new issues would be treated separately.  Mr.
Baird reminded the Senator's attorney that he had earlier
raised this question, and that Mr. Baird had made it clear
that the Committee was obligated to follow up on any
information of potential misconduct within its jurisdiction
that came to its attention.   Later that day, one diary
volume was produced for review by the-staff counsel.  When
Mr. Baird telephoned Senator Packwood's attorneys to ask
when additional diaries would be produced, he was told that
the next diaries in sequence for review were in the process
of undergoing additional masking in light of the Committee's
discovery of the new materials.  Senator Packwood's attorney
explicitly confirmed that not only was he now masking
additional material based upon the Committee's discovery of
information relating to potential misconduct in new areas,
but that additional material had been masked in the single
diary volume that had been delivered for review by the
Committee earlier that afternoon.  Senator Packwood's
attorney was told that additional masking was unacceptable,
and if the Senator was not willing to produce his diaries
pursuant to the original agreement, the Committee would need
to consider subpoenaing them. At that point, Senator
Packwood broke off all further cooperation under the
agreement, refusing to provide copies of any of the
approximately 170 pages or portions of pages from 1984
through early 1990 that Committee counsel had already
reviewed and determined to be relevant.

   d.   The Committee Insists on Completing its Review of
the Diaries

   The Committee requested that Senator Packwood immediately
complete his production of the remaining diaries.  The
Committee proposed that the Senator deliver them, after
masking them in the three categories previously agreed upon,
to Kenneth Starr, who would review the masked material to
ensure that it complied with the agreement, and then forward
the masked diaries to the Committee counsel for review.
Counsel would review only the unmasked material, identify
entries relevant to matters within the Committee's
jurisdiction for copying, and return the originals to Mr.
Starr for safekeeping.

   Senator Packwood refused to accept this proposal, or to
resume abiding by his original agreement with the Committee.
Instead, he insisted on masking additional materials,
including all entries which relate to political, campaign,
staff or similar activities and are wholly unrelated to the
sexual misconduct/intimidation issues. [fn 13]  He further
demanded that the Committee agree not to pursue at that time
either the new matters its counsel had discovered, or any
other matters outside the scope of the preliminary inquiry.
The Committee rejected the Senator's proposal.

   e.   The Committee Votes to Issue a Subpoena

   On October 20, after advising the Senator's attorneys
that continued recalcitrance would lead to a subpoena, the
Committee voted unanimously to issue a subpoena to Senator
Packwood, requiring him to produce his diaries from January
1, 1989 to the present, by delivering them to Mr. Starr.
The subpoena required production forthwith of:  "All
diaries, journals, or other documents, including tape
recordings and materials stored by computer or electronic
means, in his possession, custody, or control, which were
prepared by him or at his direction, recording or describing
his daily activities for January 1, 1989 through the
present."     Senator Packwood's attorneys were informed
that he would still be permitted to mask attorney-client and
physician-patient material, and information relating to
personal, private family matters, subject to Mr. Starr's
review.  The subpoena was served on Senator Packwood on the
morning of October 21.  The Committee informed Senator
Packwood that, unless he complied with the subpoena, the
Committee intended to meet later that day to consider
reporting a resolution to the full Senate seeking authority
to initiate a civil action to enforce the subpoena. Senator
Packwood sought additional time to respond, and repeated his
attorneys' earlier proposal that the Committee defer
attempting to obtain information related to newly discovered
matters and limit its request to the sexual misconduct and
witness intimidation issues.
   The Committee unanimously voted to report a resolution to
the Senate to seek civil enforcement of its subpoena unless
Senator Packwood produced the diaries immediately.  upon
receiving no response from Senator Packwood, on the evening
of October 21, the Committee reported the enforcement
resolution to the Senate.

       f.   The Senate Debates Enforcement of the Subpoena

   The Senate took up consideration of the resolution on
November 1.  The Senate debated the resolution for
approximately fifteen hours on November 1 and 2.

   At the request of Senator Packwood and his attorneys, the
Committee leadership and Committee counsel met with Senator
Packwood and his attorneys on the evening of November 1.  In
response to Senator Packwood's claim that he did not know
what new matters in the diaries had drawn the Committee's
attention, Victor Baird again set forth, as he had done
earlier to Senator Packwood's attorneys, the precise
provisions of federal law, Senate rules, and standards that
were potentially implicated by particular entries in the
diaries.

   Senator Packwood then offered to produce all diary
entries that he judged to be relevant to either the initial
matters under Committee inquiry, or the new matters that had
come to the Committee's attention regarding solicitation of
income for his wife.  He proposed that Mr. Starr (who was
not aware of this proposal) review the completeness of his
production, but on the  condition that he not divulge any
evidence he found of potential new violations.  The
Committee met and unanimously rejected Senator Packwood's
proposal, and informed him that it had the duty to
investigate all credible information relating to  potential
misconduct of a Senator, and could not erect a barrier
deliberately to screen itself from potential evidence of
wrongdoing.

   After extensive debate, the Senate voted 94 to 6 to adopt
the Committee's proposed resolution to authorize the Senate
Legal Counsel to enforce the Committee's subpoena.

   g.   The Committee Proposes a Process for Review of the
Diaries

   The Committee then wrote to Senator Packwood, to clarify
the procedures for complying with the subpoena and to
respond to questions that Senator Packwood had raised.[fn
14]  The Committee made it clear that the subpoena required
production of only Senator Packwood's diaries and no other
documents, and that the Committee would cut off production
under the subpoena at July 16, 1993, the date of its second
document request to him.  The Committee also reemphasized
that Senator Packwood could continue to mask the three
categories agreed upon earlier.  The Committee repeated that
Mr. Starr would verify the appropriateness of all masking,
and that the Senator would still have the opportunity to
object to the Committee on the relevance of any materials
selected and copied from his diaries by Committee counsel.

 h.   Senator Packwood Offers to Resign     

      On November 17, 1993, Senator Packwood wrote to
Senators Bryan and McConnell, stating that he did not choose
to fight on, and that he was "emotionally, physically, and
financially exhausted."  He asked that the Committee accept
his plea of nolo contendere to the charges involving sexual
misconduct and intimidation.  The Committee met on November
18, and discussed the letter over several hours.  It was
unclear from the letter, for example, what Senator Packwood
meant by his wish to "put this matter behind me, without
further proceedings," or what would be encompassed in a plea
of nolo contendere; it was decided that staff would meet
with Senator Packwood's attorneys to discuss these issues.
[fn 15]

   By the time of this Committee meeting on November 18, the
Justice Department had already notified the Committee that
it intended to open an inquiry into possible solicitation of
employment by Senator Packwood for his spouse, and had asked
about the possibility of Committee staff meeting with the
Department to discuss coordination of the separate
inquiries, as the Department did not wish to interfere with
the Committee's inquiry.

   At some time during November 18, Senator Packwood
contacted Senator McConnell and during the course of their
conversation indicated that he wanted a "window of
opportunity" between the termination of the Committee's
proceeding and Justice Department action 80 that he could
destroy his diaries.  Senator McConnell immediately conveyed
this information to the Chairman and the Committee staff.

   During the evening and early morning hours of November 18
and 19, an agreement was reached that Senators Bryan and
McConnell would meet with Senator Packwood in the presence
of staff counsel and attorneys for Senator Packwood.  At
around 11:00 a.m. on November 19 the meeting took place,
with Senators Bryan, McConnell, Packwood, staff counsel, Jim
Fitzpatrick, and Bill Diefenderfer, as a "friend" of Senator
Packwood.  It became clear early on in the meeting that it
would likely be impossible for a resolution of the case to
be agreed upon in the absence of delivery of the diaries.
Senator Packwood asked that he and his attorney be excused,
and Mr. Diefenderfer presented a proposal on behalf of the
Senator: Senator Packwood would resign, the Committee would
terminate the preliminary inquiry and cease all discovery
and subpoena enforcement activity, and the subpoena would be
withdrawn. [fn 16] During this discussion with Mr.
Diefenderfer, Senator Bryan specifically mentioned the
Committee's concern about document preservation; Mr.
Diefenderfer stated that he did not believe that the Senator
had any intention of destroying the diaries.  Mr.
Diefenderfer agreed to give the Committee an hour to respond
to this proposal.

   In view of the earlier notification from the Department
of Justice of their interest in the matter, and the concerns
raised by Senator Packwood's comments to Senator McConnell
about a "window of opportunity" to destroy the diaries, it
was agreed that communication with the Justice Department
was required, in order to preserve the Department's
opportunity for access to the diaries.  Michael Davidson,
Senate Legal Counsel, joined the discussion, and agreed that
it was appropriate to contact the Department of Justice.
Mr. Davidson contacted Jack Keeney, Deputy Assistant
Attorney General of the Criminal Division, Department of
Justice, and inquired about the Department's intentions with
respect to the diaries in the event that the Committee
withdrew its subpoena.  Mr. Keeney informed Mr. Davidson
that the Department would immediately subpoena the diaries
from Senator Packwood.

   The Committee met again at about 1:30 p.m. and agreed to
Senator Packwood's proposal to resign.  Mr. Diefenderfer was
notified, and the proposal was reduced to writing in the
form of a letter which was signed by Senators Bryan and
McConnell. Before this letter could be delivered to Senator
Packwood for his signature, Mr. Diefenderfer contacted
Senator McConnell and told him that Senator Packwood had
been served with a subpoena for his diaries by the
Department of Justice, and that he no longer intended to
resign.  The Committee met later that afternoon, and was so
informed.

     i.   The Committee Goes to Court to Enforce the
Subpoena

    On November 22, 1993, Senate Legal Counsel filed an
application to Enforce the Subpoena in the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia.  Senator
Packwood's attorneys responded, claiming that the diaries
were protected from production by the Fourth and Fifth
Amendments to the Constitution.  A hearing was held on
December 16, 1993, and argument was presented by both
sides.[fn 17] On January 24, 1994, Judge Jackson issued his
ruling, finding that the Committee was entitled to
production of the diaries.  On February 7, 1994, Judge
Jackson issued a further ruling, setting out the procedures
for review by Kenneth Starr, and incorporating the
categories for masking of material that had been suggested
by the Committee in its November 19, 1993 letter to Senator
Packwood.

    2.   Evidence of Possible Alteration

       During the time that the Committee was seeking access
to Senator Packwood's diaries, news accounts and public
statements by Senator Packwood raised questions about how
his former secretary, Cathy Wagner Cormack, had been paid to
transcribe his diaries.  The staff took Ms. Cormack's
deposition in order to determine whether she was paid from
Senate or campaign funds, as opposed to Senator Packwood's
personal funds, for transcription of the diaries.

   After her deposition was transcribed and she had an
opportunity to review it, Ms. Cormack provided a sworn
affidavit to the Committee, indicating that after the
initiation of the Ethics Committee investigation, Senator
Packwood had taken back from her some tapes that he already
had given her to transcribe, and that at a later time it
appeared to her that he may have made some revisions to
those tapes.  She also stated that Senator Packwood
confirmed to her that he had made changes to the tapes.
Based on this information, Ms. Cormack's deposition was
taken a second time, on December 15, 1993, and she confirmed
the information she had included in her affidavit.

   That Senator Packwood's diaries may have been altered was
set forth in a December 7, 1993 letter provided to the
Chairman of the Committee by Senator Packwood's attorney,
which stated, inter alia, that:

"With what may be a few or possibly no exceptions, the
originals of these tapes (the diaries) are among the
materials now held by Arnold & Porter. . . . In discrete
instances, the transcripts depart from the original tapes.
Based on a recounting of events, it is unlikely such
transcripts were among the transcripts examined by the
Senate ethics Committee staff. [fn 18]

   The information indicating possible alteration of the
diaries was provided to Judge Jackson, who, at the hearing
on December 16, 1993, ordered that all diaries, including
transcripts and audiotapes, be immediately deposited with
the Court for safekeeping pending the Court's decision on
the Committee's application to enforce the subpoena.


   3.   Procedure for Production of Diaries to the
Committee, and the Committee's Review of the Diaries

    a.   The Court's Order

   On February 7, 1994, after conducting a status conference
with the parties to discuss procedures to implement the
Court's January 24, 1994 Order granting the Committee's
application to enforce its subpoena, the Court issued an
Order setting out procedures under which the Committee would
obtain Senator Packwood's diaries. [fn 19]

    Kenneth Starr was appointed Special Master[fn 20], and
the tapes and transcripts that had been turned over to the
Court as a result of the December 16, 1993 hearing were
transferred to him. Mr. Starr was instructed to provide the
transcripts and tapes to the Federal Bureau of Investigation
for duplication, with copies to be provided to Mr. Starr,
Senator Packwood, and the Clerk of the Court.  The original
transcripts and tapes were returned to Mr. Starr for
possible later forensic examination to determine the nature
and extent of any alterations, if requested by the
Committee.

   The Court's Order provided that Senator Packwood would
have a reasonable opportunity to mask portions of the
transcripts and audiotapes  according to the criteria for
masking allowed by the Committee. [fn 21] Mr. Starr would
then review the masking to determine if it met these
criteria, unmasking any portions that did not, and provide a
copy to the Committee.

     b.   Production of the Diaries to the Committee

       1.   Diary Transcripts

   The Committee began receiving copies of diary transcripts
[fn 22] that had been masked by Senator Packwood on March
30, 1994. Although these copies had not yet been reviewed by
Mr. Starr to determine if they had been properly masked,
they were provided to the Committee in an attempt to avoid
unnecessary delay in the Committee's review of the diaries.
The Cormack transcripts were designated as "Q 1 through Q
10," with each "Q" representing six months of entries.  As
Mr. Starr reviewed the Cormack transcripts, he provided the
Committee with entries that he had determined did not meet
the criteria for masking.  This process continued through
April 29, 1994, when the Committee received the last of the
Cormack transcripts.

       2.   Diary Tapes

    The Court's Order of February 7, 1994, contemplated that
Senator Packwood would have the right to mask the audiotapes
that corresponded to the Cormack transcripts.  It also
provided that Mr. Starr could reassess his judgment about
the propriety of any masking, if he discovered alterations
in the Cormack transcript or the audiotape.

   Shortly after Senator Packwood began designating portions
of the audiotapes that should be masked, Mr. Starr informed
the parties that the audiotapes and the Cormack transcripts
were different in several respects.  There were portions of
the audiotapes that did not appear on the Cormack
transcript, and portions of the Cormack transcript that did
not appear on the audiotapes.  There were also entries on
the audiotape that were captured on the Cormack transcript,
but in a different, or paraphrased, form.  Senator Packwood
maintained that he had a right to mask portions of the
audiotape that fit the criteria allowed for masking by the
Committee, even if those portions did not correspond to the
Cormack transcript.  The Committee made clear its position
that any entries on the audiotape that did not match entries
on the Cormack transcript, or vice versa, constituted
possible evidence of alteration, and could not be masked by
Senator Packwood.  It appears that Mr. Starr permitted
further masking where he deemed it appropriate.

   The Committee began receiving audiotapes that had been
masked and reviewed by Mr. Starr in October 1994.  Because
the testimony from Ms. Cormack indicated that changes to the
diary were most likely made in 1992 and 1993, the Committee
had requested that it be provided with the tapes for these
years first.  As the Committee received the tapes for 1992
and 1993, it had them transcribed by a reporting service.
The diaries thus transcribed were compared to the Cormack
transcripts.  For the years 1989 through 1991, the staff
listened and compared the audiotapes themselves to the
Cormack transcript.

   The last of the audiotapes corresponding to Q 1 through Q
10 were received by the Committee on January 13, 1995.  A
final delivery of ten tapes occurred on February 27, 1995.

   C.   Employment Opportunities for Mrs. Packwood

    1.  Origin of Allegations

   The allegations involving inappropriate linkage of
personal financial gain to Senator Packwood's official
position by soliciting or otherwise encouraging offers of
financial assistance from persons having a particular
interest in legislation or issues that Senator Packwood
could influence are based on a number of the Senator's diary
entries from the years 1989 through 1991.

     2.  How the Investigation was Conducted

   Committee staff took sworn depositions from ten persons
referenced in the diary as possibly having some involvement
in extending employment opportunities to Mrs. Packwood.  The
Committee also took the sworn deposition of Senator
Packwood's former wife and received sworn testimony from
Senator Packwood. In total, thirteen persons were deposed on
this subject.

   In addition, the Committee subpoenaed documents from each
of the individuals mentioned above.  The subpoena called for
all documents referring or relating to either Senator or
Mrs. Packwood.  The Committee also subpoenaed documents from
Mrs. Packwood and from Senator Packwood.  In response to
these subpoenas, the Committee received in excess of four
thousand pages of documents.


III. THE COMMITTEE'S AUTHORITY TO INVESTIGATE AND SANCTION
MISCONDUCT OF MEMBERS

  A.   Authority of the Congress to Discipline Its Members

   The United States Constitution confers on each House of
Congress the power to punish and expel its Members.  Article
I provides:

   "Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings,
punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and, with the
Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member." [fn 23]

   Pursuant to this authority, in 1964, the Senate adopted
Senate Resolution 338, which created the Select Committee on
Standards and Conduct, and delegated to it the authority to
receive complaints and investigate allegations of improper
conduct which may reflect upon the Senate, violations of
law, and violations of rules and regulations of the Senate,
relating to the conduct of individuals in the performance of
their duties as Members of the Senate."[fn 24]

   In those situations where the violations are sufficiently
serious to warrant sanctions, the Committee is authorized to
recommend to the Senate by report or resolution appropriate
disciplinary action.[fn 25]

   The Senate has disciplined Members for conduct that it
has deemed unethical or improper, regardless of whether it
violated any law or Senate rule or regulation.[fn 26]  As it
adopted new rules governing Members' conduct, the Senate has
recognized that the rules did not "replace that great body
of unwritten but generally accepted standards that will, of
course, continue in effect. [fn 27]

   B.   Private Versus Official Conduct

   The Senate or House may discipline a Member for any
misconduct, including conduct or activity which does not
directly relate to official duties, when such conduct
unfavorably reflects on the institution as a whole. [fn 28]
In his historic work on the Constitution, Justice Joseph
Story noted in 1833 that Congress' disciplinary authority
for "expulsion and any other punishment" is apparently
unqualified as to "the time, place or nature of the
offense." [fn 29]  Moreover, the Supreme Court has
consistently declared that the Senate has far-reaching
discretion in disciplinary matters. [fn 30]  Precedent
within both the House and Senate has reaffirmed this broad
authority. In the censure of Senator Joseph McCarthy, the
Select Committee to Study the Censure Charges in the 83rd
Congress reported:

   "It seems clear that if a Senator should be guilty of
reprehensible conduct unconnected with his official duties
and position, but which conduct brings the Senate into
disrepute, the Senate has the power to censure." [fn 31]

Additionally, in the report on Representative Adam Clayton
Powell from the House Judiciary Committee, which recommended
that Powell be censured for misconduct, the Committee noted
that the conduct for which punishment may be imposed is not
limited to acts relating to the Member's official duties.
[fn 32]

     In proposing a permanent standing committee on ethics
in the Senate, Senator John Sherman Cooper expressly
referred to the select committee that investigated the
censure charges of Senator Joseph McCarthy as a model -- a
committee that had unambiguously asserted its authority to
investigate conduct "unconnected with [a Member's] official
duties and position." Senator Cooper and supporters of the
resolution emphasized that the Select Committee was intended
to be free to investigate anything which, in its judgment,
seemed worthy, deserving, and requiring investigation" [fn
33] and "would not be limited to alleged violations of
Senate rules, but it would take into account all improper
conduct of any kind whatever." [fn 34]

     It appears that the intent of the Senate in adopting S.
Res. 338 was to convey to the Ethics Committee the authority
to investigate and make recommendations to the full Senate
on misconduct of Members over which the institution has
jurisdiction. Nowhere in the legislative history of this
resolution was there language which expressed or implied any
intent to reserve some authority only in the full Senate, or
to limit the authority of the Committee to investigate and
report to the full Senate concerning any misconduct of a
Member within the jurisdiction of the institution.

   C. Improper Conduct Reflecting Upon the Senate

      The Senate did not attempt to delineate all the types
of conduct or the guidelines which the Committee should
follow in determining which actions by a Member would
constitute "improper conduct" reflecting on the Senate. [fn
35] It appears that the standards and guidelines of what
would be deemed proper or improper conduct for a Member
would change and evolve, both as to the perception of the
general public as well as for those within the legislature
itself. [fn 36]  The drafters of the resolution in 1964
intended that "improper conduct" would be cognizable by the
Senate when it was so notorious or reprehensible that it
could discredit the institution as a whole, not just the
individual, thereby invoking the Senate's inherent and
constitutional right to protect its own integrity and
reputation. [fn 37]

   Senate Resolution 338, as amended, which establishes and
sets forth the responsibilities of the Select Committee on
Ethics, provides, in part:

"Sec. 2(a) It should be the duty of the Select Committee
to-- 

(1) 'receive complaints and investigate allegations of
improper conduct which may reflect upon the Senate,
violations of law, violations of the Senate Code of Official
Conduct, and violations of rules and regulations of the
Senate, relating to the conduct of individuals in the
performance of their duties as Members of the Senate, or as
officers or employees of the Senate, and to make appropriate
findings of fact and conclusions with respect thereto ..."
[fn 38] (emphasis added)

   S. Res. 338 gives the Committee the authority to
investigate Members who engage in "improper conduct which
may reflect upon the Senate, regardless of whether such
conduct violates a specific statute, Senate Rule, or
regulation.  Indeed, the original Rules Committee proposal,
rejected by the Senate, would have given the Committee the
authority to investigate only alleged violations of the
rules of the Senate. [fn 39]  In offering the amendment
containing the language adopted by the Senate [fn 40],
Senator Cooper described his amendment as authorizing the
new committee "to receive complaints of unethical, improper,
illegal conduct of members. [fn 41] Senator Case, in
discussing this amendment, noted that the Committee "would
not be limited to alleged violations of Senate rules, but it
would take into account all improper conduct of any kind
whatsoever." [fn 42]

  1. Historical Context of Improper Conduct and Committee
Precedent

     The phrase "improper conduct" as used by S. Res. 338
can be given meaning by reference to generally accepted
standards of conduct, the letter and spirit of laws and
Rules [fn 43], and by reference to past cases where the
Senate has disciplined its Members for conduct that was
deemed improper, regardless of whether it violated any law
or Senate rule or regulation.

     As early as 1797, Senator William Blount was expelled
from the Senate for inciting Native Americans against the
government, despite the fact that he had committed no crime,
and neither acted in his official capacity nor during a
session of Congress. [fn 44] In 1811, the Senate censured
Senator Thomas Pickering for reading a confidential
communication on the Senate floor, despite the fact that
there was no written rule prohibiting such conduct. [fn 45]
In 1873, a Senate Committee also recommended the expulsion
of Senator James Patterson, for accepting stock at a reduced
price knowing that the offeror intended to influence him in
his official duties, for giving a false account of the
transaction, suppressing material facts, and denying the
existence of material facts which must have been known to
him. [fn 46]

     In 1929, the Senate condemned Senator Hiram Bingham for
placing an employee of a trade association with a direct
interest in tariff legislation then pending on the Senate
payroll. In 1954, the Senate condemned Senator Joseph
McCarthy for his lack of cooperation with and abuse of two
Senate committees that investigated his conduct.

     None of these cases involved conduct that was found to
violate any law, rule, or regulation, but in each case, the
conduct was deemed to violate accepted standards and values
controlling Senators' conduct.

   After the passage of S. Res. 338 establishing the Select
Committee on Standards and Conduct, the next case involving
a finding of improper conduct was the investigation of
Senator Thomas Dodd.  The Committee investigated allegations
of unethical conduct concerning the Senator's relationship
with a private businessman with overseas interests; the
conversion of campaign contributions to personal use; the
free use of loaned automobiles; and the acceptance of
reimbursements from both the Senate and private sources.
Although no Senate rule or law prohibited the use of
campaign funds for personal use at that time, the Committee
found that the testimonial dinners investigated were
political in character, and thus the proceeds should not
have been used for personal use. [fn 47]

   The Committee recommended, and the Senate adopted, a
resolution censuring Senator Dodd for having engaged in a
course of conduct

"exercising the influence and power of his office as a
United States Senator ... to obtain, and use for his
personal benefit, funds from the public through political
testimonials and a political campaign."

Such conduct, although not violative of any specific law or
Senate rule in force at that time, was found to be "contrary
to accepted morals, derogates from the public trust expected
of a Senator, and tends to bring the Senate into dishonor
and disrepute." [fn 48]

   In 1966, pursuant to S. Res. 338, the Select Committee on
Standards and Conduct began to develop recommendations for
rules and regulations regarding Senators' conduct.  The
Committee ultimately proposed S. Res. 266, the Senate Code
of Official Conduct, which addressed outside employment,
disclosure of financial interests, and campaign
contributions.  The floor debate on this resolution
demonstrates that the Rules were not intended to be a
comprehensive code of conduct for Senators, but were
targeted at a limited area of activity, and more
importantly, that they were not intended to displace
generally accepted norms of conduct.  During that debate,
the Committee's Chairman, Senator John Stennis, stated:

"We do not try to write a full code of regulations . . . .
[O]ur effort is merely to add rules and not to replace that
great body of unwritten but generally accepted standards
that will, of course, continue in effect." [fn 49]

In addition, the Committee's Vice Chairman, Senator Wallace
Bennett, stated that it was impossible to develop written
rules that address every possible area of misconduct. [fn
50]

   In 1990, upon the recommendation of the Committee, the
Senate denounced Senator David Durenberger, in part based on
his financial arrangements in connection with a condominium
in Minneapolis, finding that his conduct was deemed to have
"brought discredit upon the United States Senate" by a
"pattern of improper conduct," although the Committee did
not find -that any law or rule had been violated in
connection with the condominium. [fn 51]  However, the
Committee Chairman noted that the Senator's conduct violated
the spirit of 18 U.S.C. Section 431, which generally
prohibits a Member from benefitting from a contract with the
federal government. [fn 52]

   Most recently, in 1991 the Committee concluded that
Senator Alan Cranston engaged in improper conduct which
reflected on the Senate by engaging in an impermissible
pattern of conduct in which fund raising and official
activities were substantially linked.  The Committee found
that for about two years, Senator Cranston had personally or
through his staff contacted the Federal Home Loan Bank Board
on behalf of Lincoln Savings and Loan during a period when
he was soliciting and accepting substantial contributions
from Mr. Keating or his affiliates, and that Senator
Cranston's office practices further evidenced an
impermissible pattern of conduct in which fund raising and
official activities were substantially linked.  The
Committee specifically found that none of the activities of
Senator Cranston violated any law or Senate rule.
Nonetheless, the Committee found that his impermissible
pattern of conduct

"violated established norms of behavior in the Senate, and
was improper conduct that reflects upon the Senate, as
contemplated in Section 2(a)(1) of S. Res. 338, 88th
Congress, as amended." [fn 53]

The Committee found that Senator Cranston's conduct was
improper and repugnant, and that it deserved the "fullest,
strongest, and most severe sanction which the Committee has
the authority to impose."  The Committee issued a strong and
severe reprimand of Senator Cranston. [fn 54]

   2.   S. Res. 266 and the Code of Ethics for Government
Service

   Part III of the Select Committee's Rules of Procedure
sets out the sources of the Committee's subject matter
jurisdiction, which include, in addition to those set out in
S. Res. 338, the Preamble to S. Res. 266, and the Code of
Ethics for Government Service.  The Preamble to S. Res. 266,
by which the Senate Code of Official Conduct was first
adopted, provides that

  "(a) The ideal concept of public office, expressed by the
words, "A public office is a public trust", signifies that
the officer has been entrusted with public power by the
people; that the officer holds this power in trust to be
used only for their benefit and never for the benefit of
himself or of a few; and that the officer must never conduct
his own affairs so as to infringe on the public interest.
All official conduct of Members of the Senate should be
guided by this paramount concept of public office.

   (b)  These rules, as the written expression of certain
standards of conduct  complement the body of unwritten but
generally accepted standards that continue to apply to the
Senate." [fn 55]

      Thus, in this Preamble, specifically set out as a
source of jurisdiction for the Committee under S. Res. 338,
the Senate has recognized that it has the authority to
discipline its Members for conduct that may not necessarily
violate a law, or Senate rule or regulation, but that is
unethical, improper, or violates unwritten but generally
accepted standards of conduct that apply to the Senate. [fn
56]

   The Code of Ethics for Government Service, passed by
House Resolution on July 11, 1958, with the Senate
concurring, is also specifically listed in the Committee's
Rules as a source of jurisdiction for the Committee under S.
Res. 338.  It sets out ten broadly-worded standards of
conduct that should be adhered to by all government
employees, including office-holders.  The first and last of
these standards state that any person in government service
should:

"Put loyalty to the highest moral principles and to country
above loyalty to persons, party, or Government department.

Uphold these principles, ever conscious that public office
is a public trust." [fn 57]

    Again, these standards of conduct generally encompass
conduct that may not violate a specific law, rule, or
regulation, but that is not consistent with "loyalty to the
highest moral principles. [fn 58]

      D.   Time Limitations

          1.   Historical Context

    The United States Constitution which grants the Senate
the express authority to discipline its own Members contains
no apparent time limitation on this authority. [fn 59]
Thus, the Supreme Court, in 1897, implied an unqualified
authority of each House of Congress to discipline a Member
for misconduct, regardless of the specific timing of the
offense. [fn 60] The Court cited the case of the expulsion
of Senator Blount by the Senate as support for the
constitutional authority of either House of Congress to
punish a Member for conduct which, in the judgment of the
House or Senate, "is inconsistent with the trust and duty of
a member" even if such conduct was "not a statutable offense
nor was it committed during the session of Congress, nor at
the seat of government." [fn 61]

    The Senate Select Committee on Standards of Conduct,
predecessor of the current Committee, noted in a matter
before it in 1967, that the procedural rules for
disciplining a Member is a matter within the Senate's
discretion, as long as the institution abides by the basic
guarantees of due process within the Constitution. [fn 62]
Since discipline of its own Members is a power and authority
expressedly committed to the Senate in the Constitution, the
Senate may establish or choose its own time limitations for
investigations and disciplinary proceedings, or may choose
not to attach any specific limitations on such actions.  The
specific procedure adopted and followed by the Senate for
its own internal disciplinary actions would most likely not
be subject to judicial review because of the
non-justiciability of the issue. [fn 63]

    Historically, neither House of Congress has abdicated
its ability to punish a Member in the form of censure for
conduct which occurred in a Congress prior to a Member's
re-election to the current Congress.  In the censure of
Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, the Select Committee
to Study the Censure Charges in the 83rd Congress, after
consideration of the fact that the Senate is a continuing
body, reported:

   "It seems clear that if a Senator should be guilty of
reprehensible conduct unconnected with his official duties
and position, but which conduct brings the Senate into
disrepute, the Senate has the power to censure.  The power
to censure must be independent, therefore, of the power to
punish for contempt.  A Member may be censured even after he
has resigned (2 Hinds' Precedents 1239,1273, 1275 (1907)).
the Senate may not be punished for contempt of the Senate at
a preceding session, this is not a basis for declaring that
the Senate may not censure one of its own Members for
conduct antedating that session, and no controlling
authority or precedent has been cited for such a position.
[fn 64]

There have been indications that the Senate, in an expulsion
case, might not exercise its disciplinary discretion with
regard to conduct in which an individual had engaged before
the time he or she had been a Member. [fn 65]

     2.   Limitations Applicable to S. Res. 338 and the
Senate Code of Conduct

   The Senate does not have a rule which would limit an
inquiry into, or disciplinary action taken, within the
jurisdiction of the Select Committee on Ethics.  However,
the Senate may not conduct an initial review or
investigation of any alleged violation of law, the Senate
Code of Official Conduct, or rule or regulation that was not
in effect at the time of the alleged violation. 66 It should
be noted that the House of Representatives recently amended
its own internal rules of discipline to institute a "statue
of limitations" on internal disciplinary matters which would
restrict inquiries into conduct which occurred before the
three previous Congresses. 67

   Finally, the Senate Ethics Study Commission of the 103rd
Congress (which included the members of this Committee)
recommended in its Report to the Senate that:

"The Senate should not adopt a fixed statute of limitations,
but should continue its practice of balancing on a
case-by-case basis potentially relevant considerations, such
as fairness, staleness, integrity of evidence, reasons for
delay, and seriousness of alleged misconduct, in evaluating
the timeliness of allegations of misconduct.  High ethical
standards should be maintained throughout the period of
service within the Senate, and technical rules should not be
used to avoid the Senate's responsibility to redress serious
misconduct."

The Report further stated, in part:

"Under current practice, in determining what action to take
in response to an allegation of potential misconduct, the
Ethics Committee has discretion to take into consideration
the interval of time since the conduct allegedly occurred. A
number of factors may play a role in the Committee's
determination of its course of action, including the
fairness in investigating the allegations, the staleness of
the charges, the availability and integrity of relevant
evidence, the reasons the allegations were not presented
earlier, the seriousness of the alleged behavior, and
whether continuing effects from the alleged misconduct
persisted well after the conduct, among others."


-----------------------------------

Endnotes

1.   At his deposition in January 1995, Senator Packwood
disavowed any intent by this statement to admit to any
specific conduct; he only meant to say that if the conduct
had occurred, he was sorry.

2.  Three of the persons to whom the questionnaire was
directed were deceased.

3.  Some of the return receipts were not signed by the
addressee.  The staff interviewed three of these persons
independently of the questionnaire.

4.  The staff interviewed two of these persons independently
of the questionnaire.

5.  Two of these persons were interviewed by the staff
independently of the questionnaire.

6.  One of these persons was interviewed by the staff
independently of the Committee's questionnaire.

7.  Senator Packwood stated that he had reviewed his
diaries, but that on the advice of his counsel, he had not
reviewed them for the purposes of preparing for his
deposition.  Senator Packwood's counsel was under the
mistaken impression that if Senator Packwood reviewed the
diaries in preparation for his deposition, Committee counsel
would demand to see the diaries pursuant to the Federal
Rules of Evidence, which provide that the opposing party may
review any documents that a witness has used to refresh his
recollection in preparation for testimony.

8.  The privilege log provided to the Committee by Senator
Packwood's attorneys listed 112 memoranda that were being
withheld on the grounds of either attorney-client or
work-product privilege, and identified them by date, author,
recipient(s), and the name of the complainant or potential
complainant who was discussed in the memorandum.  The
privilege log did not disclose that attached to many of the
memoranda were excerpts from Senator Packwood's diary pages,
some of which referred to women who had made claims of
misconduct against Senator Packwood.  At his deposition, Jim
Fitzpatrick, one of Senator Packwood's attorneys at the law
firm of Arnold & Porter, testified that they viewed some of
the diary entries as falling outside the scope of the
Committee's request, and some of them as falling within the
scope; to the extent that they fell within the scope of the
request, he stated that they were adequately identified on
the privilege log.  Six of the memoranda identified on the
privilege log pre-dated the November 1992 election.  Mr.
Fitzpatrick testified that their representation of Senator
Packwood began just after that election.

9.  Also for the first time, Senator Packwood disclosed the
existence of daily records of events, which he had kept for
over twenty years, and travel records, neither of which had
been provided to the Committee in response to its requests.
Senator Packwood provided those records to the Committee
within a few days after his deposition.

10.  The diaries requested by the Committee on October 6,
1993, which were to be reviewed under the agreement were for
the following periods: January 1969 through December 1972;
January 1975 through December 1977; September 1978 through
December 1986; and August 1989 through October 6, 1993.

11.   On at least two occasions during the Committee's
review of the diaries, the Senator's attorneys informed
staff that particular passages had been masked that did not
fall within the agreed-upon categories, but which related to
extremely personal information about third parties, and were
in no way relevant to matters under inquiry.  Staff declined
an offer to examine this material, and consented to its
masking.

12.  Senator Packwood also refused to provide the Committee
with copies of these November 3 and November 6 entries, or
of any of the entries designated for copying over the
weekend of October 16 and 17.

13.   Letter from James Fitzpatrick and Daniel Rezneck to
Senators Richard H. Bryan and Mitch McConnell, October 20,
1993.

14.  Letter from Senators Richard H. Bryan and Mitch
McConnell to Senator Bob Packwood, November 9, 1993.

15.  The attorneys met with the staff, but there was a very
brief discussion with little or no elaboration on the
proposal being advanced by Senator Packwood.

16.  Informally, the Committee would not seek to curtail the
Senator's pension, an action which was not within the
Committee's power in any event.

17.  By this time, Senator Packwood had retained different
attorneys, the firm of Stein, Mitchell & Mezines, who
continue to represent him in this matter.

18.  On December 10, 1993, Michael Davidson, Senate Legal
Counsel, wrote to Senator Packwood's attorneys, stating,
inter alia:

"[i]t would be helpful and appreciated if you could advise
us of the dates of the transcripts that depart from the
original tapes, and also provide us with any other specific
information that could shed light on the integrity of the
tapes and transcripts."

Senator Packwood's attorney responded that his letter of

IV.  EVIDENCE REGARDING THE ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT


    The following is a discussion of the evidence regarding
the eighteen incidents outlined in the Committee's
Resolution of May 16, 1995.  Senate Ethics Counsel finds
that these incidents, taken collectively, reflect an abuse
of his United States Senate Office by Senator Packwood, and
that this conduct is of such a nature as to bring discredit
upon the United States Senate.

A.   Packwood Staff Member[fn 68]

     1.   Testimony by Staff Member

    This staff member was hired in March 1990 by Senator
Packwood as the press secretary for the Senate Finance
Committee minority staff.  In August 1991, she was hired as
Senator Packwood's personal press secretary; she left that
job on July 26, 1992 to take a job in Oregon.

    Around July of 1990, the Senator learned that the
staffer loved old music, movies, and books, which were also
interests of Senator Packwood.  Senator Packwood and the
staffer frequently exchanged music tapes, and Senator
Packwood occasionally invited her to his office to listen to
music with other staff members, or to look at his antique
book collection.  They also had long discussions about
politics and history.  According to the staffer, it was
typical for Senator Packwood to have wine available when she
and others were in his office.  Senator Packwood and the
staffer exchanged notes, usually accompanying the tapes.
Senator Packwood often let the staffer know that he thought
she was talented and creative, and he singled her out in
staff meetings for compliments.

   In the early fall of 1990, perhaps in September, about
5:00 p.m., Senator Packwood called the staffer at the
Finance Committee offices and asked her to come to his
office to listen to a tape of songs by Erroll Garner and
George Shearing.  When she arrived, Senator Packwood had a
box of wine on his desk and was getting out two glasses.
This was the first time that the staffer had been alone with
Senator Packwood in his office. Within moments of the
staffer's arrival, Senator Packwood was called to a vote; he
told her to stay until he returned.  As the staffer waited
in Senator Packwood's office, his secretary, Pam Fulton,
told her that she (the staffer) was new in the office, and
Ms. Fulton wanted to warn her that she should not be there
when the Senator returned.[fn 69]  The staffer left the
office before Senator Packwood returned.

   About this same time, the tone of the notes that Senator
Packwood sent her with the tapes changed, and seemed to the
staffer to become more "sentimental."  She began to feel
that Senator Packwood wanted an "emotional" type of
friendship with her, of the type that she was not used to
having with a supervisor.

   Toward the end of October 1990, possibly October 30,
Senator Packwood invited several staff members from the
Finance Committee, including the staffer, to join him at the
Irish Times bar to celebrate approval of the 1990 budget
agreement.  He wanted to buy drinks to thank the staff for
the long hours they had put in during the preceding weeks.
Senator Packwood sat next to the staffer at the bar.  Toward
the end of the evening, Senator Packwood yelled to her, over
the music, that they needed to find some way to "do this"
without letting Elaine Franklin, his chief of staff, know.
He kept staring at her, and repeated that they needed to
pursue this, but that Ms. Franklin could not come after her.
The staffer finally realized that Senator Packwood seemed to
think that they were about to start a relationship, and she
began to feel very nervous.  She excused herself to go to
the ladies room, and tried to telephone her boyfriend (now
her husband).

   After the group had been at the bar for several hours,
Senator Packwood asked another staffer, Lindy Paull, and her
husband to drive him and the staffer back to his office.  He
told them that he had something he wanted to show the
staffer.

   When they got to the office, Senator Packwood asked the
Ms. Paull and her husband to go to one of the adjoining
suites down the hall, because he had something he wanted to
show the staffer. Senator Packwood then started showing the
staffer cards in a card file that detailed the long
relationships he had with national labor leaders.  Each time
he showed her a card, he asked her, "Does Peter DeFazio know
about this friendship?"  The staffer's boyfriend was the
legislative director for Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, who
was considering running against Senator Packwood in the next
election.

   The staffer asked the Senator why he was doing this, and
told him that she was loyal, that she was not going to go to
Rep. DeFazio and tell him things about Senator Packwood.

   Senator Packwood then grabbed the staffer by the
shoulders with both hands, exclaimed "God, you're great!"
and kissed her fully on the lips.  The staffer was stunned.
She did not want the Senator to go any further, but at the
same time, she did not want to anger him.  She made an
excuse that she had to go to the bathroom, and ran down the
hall to another office.  She called her boyfriend and asked
him to pick her up right away, left the building, and waited
for him to arrive.

   The staffer avoided the Senator for a month or so.  She
made sure that she was always the first one to leave a
meeting, and that she left in a crowd.  She did not tape any
more music for Senator Packwood.  Senator Packwood no longer
singled her out or paid her special compliments in staff
meetings.

   In August 1991, the staffer was promoted to press
secretary for Senator Packwood's personal staff, with a
salary increase.

   Near the end of April 1992, the staffer learned from her
former roommate that a free-lance reporter was working on a
story about sexual harassment in the Senate.  The staffer
felt that it was her duty as Senator Packwood's press
secretary to share that information with him.  She did not
have any intention of telling the reporter about her
incident with Senator Packwood.

   When the staffer told Senator Packwood about the
reporter, he seemed frightened, and perplexed or confused
about whether he had harassed anyone, and about what exactly
constituted sexual harassment.  The staffer pointed out to
Senator Packwood that if she did not respect him so much,
she could claim that he had harassed her 18 months earlier.
Elaine Franklin was called in, and she quizzed the staffer
about how she knew about the story, and which friend had
told her about the story.  The staffer refused to say who
had told her about the story, but gave Senator Packwood and
Ms. Franklin the name and phone number of the reporter.

   After the staffer told Senator Packwood and Ms. Franklin
about the story that was being written, the staffer was left
out of campaign meetings and strategy sessions.  She felt
that there was a lack of trust in her, either because of the
story or because she had married her boyfriend, who worked
for Rep. DeFazio.  Eventually, she decided to leave the
office.  When she did so, in July 1992, Senator Packwood and
Elaine Franklin provided excellent recommendations to her
current employer.

     After the staffer told Senator Packwood and Elaine
Franklin about the story, Ms. Franklin pressed her
repeatedly for the names of others whom she told about the
incident between herself and Senator Packwood.  The staffer
told Ms. Franklin that she had told no one, although she had
told her husband and her roommate; she was afraid that Ms.
Franklin would hound them if she knew that the staffer had
told them about the incident.  Before the staffer left for
her new job, Ms. Franklin warned her not to say anything
about the incident to her new employers, or to any women's
groups.  Ms. Franklin continued to call the staffer through
the fall, pressing her for information about whom she had
told about the incident, and accusing her of lying when she
denied telling anyone.

  2.   Corroborating Witnesses

   Committee counsel deposed or interviewed four witnesses,
including the staffer's husband and her roommate at the time
of the incident, who recall the staffer telling them that
Senator Packwood had kissed her in his office one evening
after hours. The staffer's husband and her roommate recall
that she told them about the incident almost immediately
after it happened.[fn 70] Her husband testified that the
staffer was so hysterical when he picked her up that evening
that he thought at first that she might have been raped.

   Another witness stated that the staffer told her in the
summer of 1991 that Senator Packwood had tried to kiss her
several times. once in his office after hours.

   In addition, nine members of Senator Packwood's staff,
including his chief of staff, have testified that the
staffer told them that Senator Packwood had "crossed the
line," or made an inappropriate advance, or kissed her,
before word began spreading about the anticipated Washington
Post article.  Several of these persons indicated that the
staffer did not seem to take the incident all that
seriously.  Elaine Franklin testified that when she heard
from another staffer about the incident, she spoke with the
staffer, and the staffer indicated that she was not
concerned about it

   Several members of Senator Packwood's staff have stated
in depositions or interviews that when the rumors first
started surfacing about the proposed story on Senator
Packwood, there was much speculation in the office about
whether the staffer would be one of the accusers, since she
had told people about an incident before the possibility of
an article came up.

  3.   Senator Packwood's Response

   Senator Packwood testified at his deposition that he
recalled the staffer very well.  He claimed that the staff,
both from the Finance Committee and his personal office,
almost to a person intensely disliked and distrusted her,
and advised him that she was unreliable and should be
excluded from meetings.[fn 71]

    However, he could not remember the name of any person
who had so advised him.  He described it as the "collective
wisdom" of the office, and as the staffer's "general
reputation" in the office.

   Nor could Senator Packwood recall when he had first heard
complaints about the staffer, or even who had made the first
complaint.  He described the complaints as rather serious:
that she lied, fantasized, and leaked information to the
Democrats.[fn 72]  He did not know if any of these
complaints had ever been documented in writing, nor did he
produce anything to indicate that they had been.  He himself
did not instruct anyone to do so. During an interview with
Washington Post reporters in October 1992 about the
allegation, Elaine Franklin had told the reporters that she
would look for office records that reflected the staffer's
poor performance.  Senator Packwood did not know if there
were any such records, or if Ms. Franklin had found any, or
even if they kept such records.  He stated that he did not
know what Ms. Franklin was talking about, but that as far as
he knew, there were no such files.

   Senator Packwood disclaimed responsibility for making the
decision to bring the staffer from the Finance Committee
staff to his personal staff, although he did concede that he
was aware of the decision, and that he had the power to veto
it.  He stated that even if he were aware of the problems
she had on the Finance Committee staff at the time, he would
have approved her move to the personal staff, because he
would assume that whoever made that decision knew about the
problems too, and he did not feel strongly enough to veto
that decision.

   Senator Packwood's records indicate that the staffer
received raises while on the Finance Committee, and that she
received a small raise while she worked on his personal
staff. Senator Packwood would not concede that he approved
this raise, or even knew about it, saying that it could have
been done without his knowledge, if someone just gave him a
list of proposed raises which he signed without
reviewing.[fn 73]

   Senator Packwood claimed that once she was on the
personal staff, the staffer caused problems with everyone
who came in contact with her.  He stated that she was a
topic of common complaint - that she was indiscreet, that
she fantasized, that she lied, and that she was not to be
trusted - but again, he could not remember any specific
staff members who told him of these complaints.

   Senator Packwood was referred to three entries in his
diary where he reviewed the performance of his staff,
something he did periodically throughout his diaries.
Senator Packwood stated that these reviews reflected his
judgments about his staff members at the time. although he
was sometimes wrong in those judgments.[fn 74] His staff
reviews dated August 3 and November 5, 1990, do not mention
the staffer, although he did not hesitate to make
unfavorable comments about several other staffers.  His
staff review dated March 16, 1992 indicates that the Senator
viewed the staffer as "okay," but immature; he testified
that by "immature," he meant that she was a "torrent of
indiscretion."[fn 75] However, Senator Packwood did not
mince words when describing the performance of other
staffers in this entry.

   In fact, there are a number of references to the staffer
in Senator Packwood's diary during the time she worked for
the Finance Committee and on his personal staff.  There is
no indication that she was causing any problems, or that her
conduct was as described by Senator Packwood in his
deposition.  In fact, various entries indicate that it was
good to have the staffer taking control of the press (May
10, 1991); that she continued to be the bright light - bold,
imaginative, forward, and sassy (July 29, 1991); that the
staffer made Senator Packwood believe (July 31, 1991); and
that now that he was not thinking of running for President,
Senator Packwood would bring her down as his press secretary
once the election was over (July 31, 1991).[fn 76]

   Senator Packwood testified that he liked the staffer, and
tried to ignore the complaints for a long time.  They
exchanged friendly notes, and tapes of music they both
enjoyed.  The staffer invited him to attend a Mel Torme
concert, he assumed as part of a group.  He testified that
he later heard from another staffer (he did not recall who)
that the staffer had intended to go to the concert alone
with him, but that the other staffer had reprimanded her.
Senator Packwood did attend the concert, with a group that
included the staffer's boyfriend, a reporter for the
Oregonian and her companion, Senator Packwood's companion,
and perhaps a fourth couple.[fn 77]

    Senator Packwood stated that the staffer often hung
around his office after work until he invited her in for a
glass of wine; she had wine with him more frequently than
any other staffer.

   Senator Packwood testified that he has had to piece
together the events of the evening at the Irish Times.[fn
78] He had a dim recollection that a number of the staff
went to the Irish Times one evening, where they drank
heavily.  He recalled that he and the staffer did some heavy
drinking; another staffer who was present told him later
that they shared three large pitchers of beer; others who
were present told him that after this other staffer left,
the Senator and the staffer continued drinking.  He
testified that he talked with the staffer about labor
leaders, and which ones would be supportive of him in the
campaign; he may have intended for her to pass the
information on to the Democrats through her boyfriend.

   Senator Packwood recalled "next to nothing" about what
happened after he left the Irish Times.  He has pieced
together that he and the staffer were going to go back to
the office to look-at cards.  Lindy Paull and her husband
gave the staffer a ride, and offered to wait for her; she
declined.  He did not recall how he got back to the office.
He stated that once at the office, he and the staffer began
going through his card file, and he pointed out the names of
some labor leaders.  He did not recall kissing the staffer
that evening, and has no idea what happened after he left
the office.

   Senator Packwood testified that about a year later,
around October 1991, he and the staffer invited a reporter
to come by for a glass of wine.  The reporter left about
7:00 or 7:15, and the staffer stayed, and they continued
drinking.  Later, the Senator got up to change a tape or to
go to the bathroom.  When he came back, the staffer wrapped
her arms around his neck, and gave him a big romantic kiss,
telling him that he was "wonderful," "warts and all."[fn 79]

   In February or March of 1992, Elaine Franklin told the
Senator that she had heard from others that the staffer
claimed that the Senator had kissed her after the Irish
Times party.  Ms. Franklin claimed that she had sat the
staffer down and asked her about it; the staffer told her
that it was nothing, they were both drunk, that it was a
harmless kiss, and that she was flattered.  Ms. Franklin
also told him that the staffer drank a lot and could not
hold her liquor well.

   Senator Packwood did not recall that the staffer had
talked to him about the incident at any time, or more
specifically in the spring of 1992, when she met with him
and Elaine Franklin to tell them about the Vanity Fair
article.[fn 80] He assumed that the staffer was trying to
help them, but that he and Ms. Franklin just did not trust
the staffer, as far as what she said her sources were for
the rumors about the story.

   The staffer left Senator Packwood's office in 1992.  He
recalled a brief conversation with her current supervisor,
asking if the Senator would mind if they hired the staffer.
Senator Packwood told him that he would not mind.  He
testified that he was happy to have her go.

   Senator Packwood was shown a press release from his
office, noting that the the[sic] staffer's new employer was
getting an experienced press person in the staffer, and
quoting Senator Packwood:

"[The staffer] has spent years working on issues related to
the [new employer].  She will serve them well.  This is
really a golden opportunity for her."[fn 81]

   Senator Packwood testified that he could not recall when
he first saw this press release, or if anyone else in his
office saw it before it went out.  He did not know if it was
customary for his office to issue a press release when a
staffer took another job, or whether this was the first time
such a press release had been issued.

   Senator Packwood testified that the staffer was overtly
friendly to him, hung around and drank with him, flirted
with him, and sought his attention and approval.  He thought
that she wanted to be close to him, to be his "number one."
But he stated that it would be too strong a characterization
to say that she wanted a romantic or sexual relationship
with him.  He never had the sense that she wanted to have an
affair with him, or to go to bed with him.

   Senator Packwood recalled that the staffer wore short
skirts and low-cut blouses to work, but he never said
anything about it. He learned from Lindy Paull, after the
Post interview, that she had talked to the staffer about
inappropriate and unprofessional dress.

   In response to the Committee's document requests, Senator
Packwood provided "Ramspeck" application forms that had been
filled out for the staffer, dated April 29, 1992, in
connection with her application to her new employer.  One of
these forms was signed by Senator Packwood's office manager,
Jackie Wilcox, and one purported to be signed by Senator
Packwood.  The forms indicated that the staffer's
performance as an employee had been "extraordinarily
effective and efficient."  Senator Packwood testified that
the signature was not his.  He could not say who in his
office had the authority to sign his name to official
documents, but only that his office had a sort of "rule of
reason" approach to the subject.  Senator Packwood's
attorneys later provided a statement to the Committee from
Ms. Wilcox, stating that the staffer had asked her to fill
out the form, and that when she learned that she needed the
Senator's signature, she had asked Ms. Wilcox to sign it.

     In his appearance before the Committee, Senator
Packwood repeated his claim that there had been many
problems with this employee. He also emphasized that other
witnesses had claimed that this staffer acted in such a way
to suggest that she wanted a sexual relationship with him,
and that on the evening of the incident, she was all over
him. He told the Committee that it was understandable that
he might have perceived that she wanted him to kiss her, and
that he was only human.

       4. Findings

     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incident as
alleged by the staff member did in fact occur. Counsel notes
that the staff member's account of the incident has been
corroborated,~in whole or part, by numerous persons,
including Elaine Franklin, Senator Packwood's chief of staff
and several staff members. Senator Packwood himself has not
denied that the incident occurred; he has testified that he
was too drunk to remember the details of the evening.

     Counsel notes that Senator Packwood has gone to great
lengths to portray this staff member as untrustworthy. This
claim, even if proven, has no relevance to a determination
as to whether the incident as alleged actually occurred. The
fact that this staff member may have lied on other
occasions, or that she may have been untrustworthy because
her boyfriend worked for one of Senator Packwood's
opponents, sheds absolutely no light on whether she
fabricated the incident in question. Moreover, the accounts
of the numerous persons whom she told about this incident,
including Ms. Franklin, his chief of staff, overwhelmingly
confirm that it did in fact happen.

     Even if Senator Packwood's claims that this staff
member was untrustworthy were relevant to a determination of
whether this incident in fact occurred, these claims are
belied by the lack of any contemporaneous documentation from
Senator Packwood's files indicating that this staff member
was indeed the terrible employee that he portrays. In fact,
she moved from the Finance Committee staff to his personal
staff, and received several salary raises. A glowing press
release was issued on her departure. And although Senator
Packwood made it a practice to critique his employees
frequently in his diary, and did not hesitate to make fairly
scathing comments about them, there is not one mention in
his diaries while this staff member worked for him that
indicates she was a problem employee. To the contrary, there
are several complimentary references to her.

     Senator Packwood himself has as much as admitted that
this incident took place: he told the Committee during his
appearance before it that several of his staff members have
said that this staff member acted in a way to suggest that
she was interested in a sexual relationship with him, that
it was understandable why he might conclude that she wanted
him to kiss her, and that he only acted in a human fashion.
In short, he had suggested that the staffer enticed him into
an overture that he perceived as welcome. In fact, however,
at his deposition, when asked whether he concluded from
anything that the staffer did that she wanted a romantic or
sexual relationship with him, Senator Packwood responded
that although she wanted a close relationship with him, and
her nature was "obviously flirtatious" with him, "romantic
or "sexual - would be too strong a word, and he never had
the sense that the staffer was saying "let's have an
affair," or "let's go to bed together.' In other words, this
staff member never said or did anything that led him to
conclude that she was interested in a romantic or sexual
relationship with him.

     Senator Packwood proffers the fact that this staff
member continued to work for him, that she continued to send
him warm notes, and that she kissed him about a year later.
Of course, these facts, even if true, do not prove that the
incident did not take place.  They may indicate that the
staff member did not take the incident seriously, as some of
Senator Packwood's staff members have testified.  Or they
may indicate that the staff member did not feel that she had
the power to do anything about the incident, and chose to
maintain a good relationship with the Senator for the sake
of her job and her career.

   Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's
conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that
reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of
conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon
the Senate.

   B.   Judy Foster-Filppi

         1.   Testimony of Ms. Foster-Filppi

   In the early 1980's, Ms. Foster-Filppi was a Packwood
supporter who frequently hosted get-togethers for Senator
Packwood and his wife and supporters at her home.  She was
an important contact for Senator Packwood's campaign in the
Lane County and Eugene area, and by 1985 was discussing with
a Packwood staffer the possibility of heading up the
re-election campaign in Lane County.

   On a weekday in early 1985, perhaps March or April, when
she had known Senator Packwood for about four years, Ms.
Foster- Filppi went to Bend, Oregon, with Senator Packwood
and Elaine Franklin, for a campaign appearance at a
supporter get-together. Senator Packwood and Ms. Franklin
picked Ms. Foster-Filppi up at her home in a motor coach,
and they travelled about three hours to reach Bend.  The
motor coach was driven by another staff member, and they
were also accompanied by another woman staff member.  That
evening, there was dinner and wine and dancing for thirty or
forty business supporters at the River House, which is where
the group spent the night.

   After dinner, when the group had moved into another room
for dancing, Senator Packwood asked Ms. Foster-Filppi to
dance. While they were dancing, Senator Packwood pulled her
close, put his hands on her back, and rubbed her back,
buttocks and sides. At least twice, she pushed him away, and
tried to distract him with conversation.  She specifically
remembers discussing briefly whether Senator Packwood was
going to run for the presidency. Bach time, Senator Packwood
pulled her back, and again rubbed her back, buttocks, and
sides.  He nuzzled her neck several times, and several times
pushed his hips and pelvic area into her body as he held his
hand on her lower back.  When the dance ended, she moved
away.  She knew that he had been drinking that evening,
although she did not think that he was drunk.  She kept her
distance after that, and left the gathering a short time
later to return to her room.  The next morning, the Senator
and his staff dropped her off in Eugene, and traveled on to
Portland in the van.

   Later in 1985, possibly in the summer, Ms. Foster-Filppi
attended a small dinner party in Eugene, Oregon, along with
Senator Packwood and Elaine Franklin.  When the party was
over, at Ms. Franklin's request, Ms. Foster-Filppi drove her
and the Senator back to the New Oregon Motel, where they
were staying. Senator Packwood sat in the front passenger
bucket seat, and Ms. Franklin sat in the rear behind the
campaign worker.  When Ms. Foster-Filppi pulled into the
motel parking lot, Ms. Franklin gave her a hug, said
goodnight, and got out of the van.  Senator Packwood told
Ms. Franklin that he was just going to say goodnight to Ms.
Foster-Filppi and he would be right in.  After Ms. Franklin
left, Senator Packwood moved towards Ms. Foster- Filppi with
his hands out.  Ms. Foster-Filppi assumed that he was about
to give her a hug, just as Ms. Franklin had done, and she
moved towards him with her arms out.  He grabbed her face
with his hands, pulled her towards him, and kissed her on
the mouth, forcing his tongue into her mouth.  She put her
arms on his shoulders and pushed him away, and said
goodnight.  The Senator said goodnight and got out, and 6he
drove away.

   The next day, Ms. Foster-Filppi called Elaine Franklin
and told her what had happened.  She told Ms. Franklin that
she was upset, that she felt deceived, and she was not sure
if she could trust the Senator anymore.  She asked Ms.
Franklin if this was the kind of behavior that she could
expect if she became involved in the Senator's campaign.
Ms. Franklin apologized and told Ms. Foster-Filppi not to
worry, that she could not imagine what had gotten into
Senator Packwood; she said that it would never happen again,
and that she would talk to the Senator.  Several days later,
Senator Packwood called Ms. Foster-Filppi at her home; she
judged from the stern and forceful tone of his voice that he
was upset.  He told her that he knew she was upset with him,
and that she had talked with Ms. Franklin about something he
had done.  He told her that she should never talk to someone
else if she had a problem with his behavior, but that she
should talk with him and he would handle it.  He told her
that there was no reason to talk to anybody else about his
behavior.

   After this incident and the telephone call, Ms. Foster-
Filppi felt that she could no longer trust Senator Packwood.
She did not want to put herself in a position where she
would be physically close to him, and she questioned whether
she could even continue to support him for re-election.  In
October or November of 1985, she told Elaine Franklin that
she was too busy to manage the campaign in Lane County.  Ms.
Franklin was very upset, and told her that they had been
counting on her.

     2.   Corroborating Witnesses

   Ms. Foster-Filppi testified that other than Ms. Franklin,
she did not tell anyone about the incidents with Senator
Packwood.  Ms. Franklin confirmed that the campaign worker,
who was being considered to be co-chair of the Lane County
campaign, had told her, in 1985, that the Senator had hugged
her and kissed her, and that Ms. Foster-Filppi was
"surprised" by his actions; she passed this information on
to the Senator.

     3.   Senator Packwood's Response

   Senator Packwood met Ms. Foster-Filppi in 1981, when
Eugenia Hutton, another campaign worker, had her arrange a
coffee for the Senator at her house.  From that time until
1986, she and Ms. Hutton were his two principal contacts in
Lane County, and Ms. Foster-Filppi ended up taking over from
Ms. Hutton.

   Senator Packwood claimed that he had checked hi6 travel
records, and that he was not in Bend at all in 1985, when
Ms. Foster-Filppi claimed the incident occurred at the River
House.  He stated that it would be unusual to go over the
mountains and back, from Eugene to Bend, over so short a
time in the winter.  He had no recollection of ever driving
from Eugene to Bend with Ms. Foster-Filppi in the motor
coach, nor did he recall ever being at the River House with
Ms. Foster-Filppi   He did not recall the incident that Ms.
Foster-Filppi described, whether it occurred at the River
House or elsewhere.

   Senator Packwood did not recall a specific dinner party
that he attended with Ms. Foster-Filppi in Eugene in 1985,
but he did recall that Ms. Foster-Filppi drove him and
Elaine Franklin back from a function in Eugene, presumably
to their motel.  He stated that Ms. Foster-Filppi got out of
the van to say good night to them, and gave Ms. Franklin a
hug.  She then put her arms out toward him, and he gave her
a warm kiss on the lips; he did not recall if it was a
french kiss.  He did not recall kissing Ms. Foster-Filppi at
any time before that.

   Sometime later, perhaps the next time they were in
Eugene, Elaine Franklin told him that she had had drinks
with Ms. Foster- Filppi, who had told her that Senator
Packwood had kissed her. Ms. Franklin told the Senator that
he should not be so enthusiastic with volunteers.  Senator
Packwood thought that he had called Ms. Foster-Filppi and
said something to the effect of, "for gosh sakes, Judy, if
you've got any problems, call me directly."  He claimed that
she continued to work actively in his 1986 campaign, and
through the election.  They had considered her in 1985 for
the county chair position, but she declined.  Senator
Packwood stated that at this point, the county chair
position was being phased out anyway.

   Senator Packwood was questioned about an entry in his
diary for August 5, 1993:[fn 82]

"... if they're not going to take hearsay, then they've got
to take only complaining witnesses.  And if they don't have
Judy Foster, and whatever that woman's name is, the intern -
- I mean, ex-intern, she wasn't an intern - - as complaining
witnesses, then I think there is nothing in this decade of
any consequence to be afraid of."

   Senator Packwood testified that they had figured out that
Ms. Foster-Filppi was making a claim, based on the
descriptions in the media accounts.  He testified that
"they" in the entry referred to the Ethics Committee, and
that they believed that if the Committee were to judge
conduct that occurred a long time ago differently than
conduct that occurred in the last ten years, the only
allegation they knew of other than one other staffer's (C-1)
was the claim that Senator Packwood tried to kiss Ms.
Foster- Filppi.  Senator Packwood would not say whether he
thought it would be more damaging if incidents occurred in
the past decade, as opposed to earlier.

   In his appearance before the Committee, Senator Packwood
stated that he had searched his records, and that he had
concluded that the incident described by Ms. Foster-Filppi
as occurring after a dinner party in Eugene had actually
happened in 1981, and not in 1985, as she alleges.  He
claimed that in reviewing her description of the dinner
party, he had deduced where it had taken place, and had
talked to the persons he concluded gave the dinner party,
who confirmed that the dinner party took place in 1981.
Senator Packwood offered this conclusion to bolster his
claim that all of the incidents, save the incident alleged
to have occurred in 1990, had happened more than ten years
earlier.

   However, Ms. Foster-Filppi specifically recalls that this
incident occurred when she had known Senator Packwood for
about four years, and close to the 1986 election, and that
when she declined the position of County Chair, Senator
Packwood's staffer was upset because they had counted on
her.  The timing is corroborated by the testimony of Elaine
Franklin, who recalls that Ms. Foster-Filppi told her of the
incident in 1985, at a time when they were considering her
to be a co-County chair.

   Senator Packwood also claimed that Ms. Foster-Filppi had
maintained friendly relations with him, and that she had
returned a postcard indicating that she would be happy to
allow her name to be used on a list of persons who supported
him for reelection in 1992.  Senator Packwood has not
provided the Committee with this postcard.

   4.   Findings

   Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incidents as alleged
by Ms. Foster-Filppi in fact occurred.  The first incident
described by Ms. Foster-Filppi, which occurred during a
function in Bend, Oregon, has not been contested by Senator
Packwood, except to offer that his travel and other records
did not reflect that he went from Eugene to Bend and back in
1985.  Otherwise, he has testified that he does not recall
the incident.

   Although his recollection of the details differs from
that of Ms. Foster-Filppi, Senator Packwood has admitted
that he kissed her after she drove him and Ms. Franklin to
their hotel after a dinner party in Eugene.  He does not
deny, but simply does not recall, certain details of the
incident, such as whether he gave Ms. Foster-Filppi a french
kiss.  Ms. Foster-Filppi's claim is corroborated, at least
to the extent that Senator Packwood kissed her, and with
respect to the timing of the incident, by the testimony of
Elaine Franklin, to whom Ms. Foster-Filppi complained after
the incident.

   Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's
conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that
reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of
conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon
the Senate.

   C.   Mary Heffernan

     1.   Testimony of Mary Heffernan

   In 1981 and 1982, Mary Heffernan was employed by the
National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL).  As part of
her job, she communicated with Senator Packwood, who was a
powerful NARAL ally, on issues affecting reproductive
choice.  In connection with her job, she spoke with Senator
Packwood six to twelve times a year, mostly by telephone.
Senator Packwood frequently wrote Ms. Heffernan notes that
were supportive and encouraging, and also sometimes very
flattering, telling her what a good job she was doing for
the abortion rights movement.  He also wrote to her parents
praising her work and abilities. Because of the warm and
personal nature of the notes, Ms. Heffernan felt that
Senator Packwood was singling her out for special attention,
possibly grooming her to work for him in the future.

   During that time period, Ms. Heffernan set up an
appointment with Senator Packwood's staff to meet him at his
office in Washington, D.C. to discuss issues relating to
abortion legislation.  When she arrived at the office, Ms.
Heffernan was escorted into Senator Packwood's private
office; the Senator sat behind his desk, and she sat in
front of the desk.  The door to the outer office was closed.
They talked for about thirty minutes about abortion
legislation issues.  Toward the end of the meeting, when Ms.
Heffernan got up from her chair and started to move away,
Senator Packwood came around his desk, put his hands on her
upper arms and squeezed them, and leaned over and gave her a
sensual, sexual kiss on the mouth.  She stepped back, got
her coat, opened the door, and quickly left the room.

   After this incident, Ms. Heffernan was careful to avoid
being alone with the Senator.  She did not complain to
anyone about the incident, out of concern that that might
adversely affect the abortion rights cause for which she was
working so hard.  Her contacts with Senator Packwood were
less frequent, and the correspondence from Senator Packwood
slowed.

       Ms. Heffernan left NARAL in March of 1983.  Two or
three times after that, she heard from Senator Packwood, who
called her to ask what she was doing.  Although nothing
specific was ever said, her impression was that Senator
Packwood might be considering asking her to come work on his
staff.

    2.   Corroborating Witnesses

   Ms. Heffernan testified that she told no one about this
incident.  Her former husband contacted the Committee, and
stated that while he did not think that she would lie about
the actual incident that occurred, he would not believe her
if she claimed that the incident had a negative effect on
her.  He indicated that in the fall of 1983, when she was
living with him, Senator Packwood had called her; after the
call, she told him that she thought the Senator was
interested in hiring her.  Although she did not tell him so,
her ex-husband had the impression that she might be
interested in taking the job.  He indicated that he and Ms.
Heffernan had had an unpleasant divorce.

    3.   Senator Packwood's Response

   Senator Packwood recalled meeting Ms. Heffernan in 1977,
when she visited his office with a friend.  She was very
active in his 1980 campaign, and he continued to see her in
1981 and 1982 when she was active in NARAL.  In February
1984, he talked with her on the phone about working for him.
About a month later, he and Elaine Franklin took Ms.
Heffernan to lunch in the Senate dining room, and Ms.
Heffernan asked if there would be a spot for her in the 1986
campaign.[fn 83]  Later, she also asked one of his friends
the same thing; he talked with Senator Packwood about it.
Senator Packwood did not offer Ms. Heffernan a job, because
she wanted a job as a volunteer coordinator, and he did not
think that was the job for her:  she was a good worker, but
not very good at producing volunteers.

   Senator Packwood did not recall the incident described by
Ms. Heffernan, or that he ever kissed her at any time.

   In his appearance before the Committee, Senator Packwood
emphasized that Ms. Heffernan had maintained a warm, close
relationship with him after the incident, that she had
sought a job with him, and that she had in fact kissed him
on a subsequent occasion.[fn 84]

     4.   Findings

   Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incident as alleged
by Ms. Heffernan in fact occurred.  Although there are no
corroborating witnesses, Senator Packwood has offered no
evidence to refute Ms. Heffernan's testimony about the
incident; he has testified only that he does not recall the
incident.  Senator Packwood has proferred evidence that Ms.
Heffernan maintained a warm and close relationship with him
after the incident, and even sought a job with him,
presumably either to show that the incident did not occur,
or that if it did, Ms. Heffernan could not have been
offended.  However, even if true, the fact that Ms.
Heffernan maintained a close relationship with the Senator,
and sought a job with him, does not prove that the incident
did not happen.  It could indicate that Ms. Heffernan did
not take offense at the incident, or it could indicate that
she recognized the need to maintain a good relationship with
a powerful person who was very important to her career.

   Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's
conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that
reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of
conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon
the Senate.

   D.   Paige Wagers

         1.   Testimony by Paige Wagers

   Paige Wagers worked for Senator Packwood as a mail clerk
from the summer of 1975 until the summer of 1976.  Sometime
in late 1975, she was sitting at her desk in the mail room
when her intercom buzzed.  When the she picked up her phone,
Senator Packwood asked her to come to his office.  She was
nervous, because she had never been called into the
Senator's office before.  Up to that point, she had seen
Senator Packwood at staff meetings, or in passing in the
hall; it was not customary for her to have contact with him.
She walked towards the Senator's office, and noticed that
there was no one in the reception area outside the Senator's
office, where the secretary and appointment secretary
usually sat.  Senator Packwood was standing just inside the
door of his office, waiting for her.  He told her to come
in, and she went into his office.

   Senator Packwood immediately closed the door, and without
saying anything to Ms. Wagers, grabbed her and pinned her
with her back up against a wall or a small desk.  He held
her hair with one hand, bending her head backwards.  His
other hand stroked her hair and arm and chest.  He pressed
his face against hers so hard that she could not move him
away, and kissed her, sticking his tongue in her mouth.  Ms.
Wagers tried to get her hands up to push Senator Packwood
away, and to keep his hand away from her breasts.  Senator
Packwood's body was pressed so closely against Ms. Wagers'
that she could not move.  When the kiss was over, Ms. Wagers
turned her head and started talking; Senator Packwood tried
to kiss her again, but she kept turning her head from side
to side.  She told Senator Packwood that she wanted their
relationship to be professional, that she liked him very
much, and liked her job very much, but she did not think
this was the right thing to do.  She told him that she
respected him, that he was married, and that it was not
proper for them to be in his office alone, or for him to be
kissing her.  She told Senator Packwood that she did not
want this kind of a relationship with him, that it was not
right for her, that she respected him and really wanted to
keep on working there.  Senator Packwood told her that he
liked her hair, he thought she was young and beautiful and
innocent and wholesome, and he liked her wholesomeness and
everything about her.  He told her that he just wanted to
touch her, and repeated many times that she was so
wholesome.  He continued trying to kiss her, with one hand
holding her head back by her hair, and the other hand
touching her arm and chest.  Finally he let her go  she told
him she had to go back to work, and left his office.

   Ms. Wagers returned to her desk, shaking and crying.  She
told friends about the incident, and was advised to say
nothing. This was her first job, and she had been advised
that she should stay in a job for at least a year before
moving on to another one.  She waited until the summer of
1976, and left Senator Packwood's office.

   Ms. Wagers continued to see Senator Packwood
occasionally, when she attended staff reunions, or functions
with Tim Lee, a Packwood staff member whom she dated for a
time after she left Senator Packwood's office.

   In the spring of 1981, Ms. Wagers was working as a
special assistant for legislative affairs at the Department
of Labor. One day, as she got off the elevator on her way
down to the basement of the Capitol, she ran into Senator
Packwood, who was coming up the escalator from the trolley
that runs from the Senate office buildings.  There were many
people around, and she and Senator Packwood ended up by
chance right next to each other, between the escalators from
the trolley and the elevator. Senator Packwood said hello to
her, very politely touched her lightly on both arms and
asked how she was, and said that it was nice to see her.  He
engaged her in conversation.

   Although her initial reaction was to experience a jolt of
fear, Senator Packwood's conversation made her feel
comfortable and secure that nothing would happen.  Indeed,
nothing had occurred on the few occasions she had seen him
since the previous incident which led her to think anything
would happen again.  She also thought that she had made it
very clear to Senator Packwood how she felt, that he was not
supposed to touch her or try to kiss her.  By his
conversation during this chance meeting, Senator Packwood
made her feel that he was interested in her as , person - he
asked her about her job, told her that he was proud of her
for getting her job, and that if he or his office could help
her, she should let him know.  As they talked, and she told
Senator Packwood about her job, he told her that he had to
walk down to his office for a minute; he asked her to come
with him and tell him what she was working on.  Senator
Packwood ushered her down a hallway in the Capitol basement
that ran from the Senate side to the House side, toward the
barber shop.

   As they walked, she talked about her job.  She felt very
good about herself, that she finally had a job with
responsibility, and knew a Senator who was willing to help
her if she needed help.  She felt that Senator Packwood was
taking her seriously, as a business person with legitimate
business to conduct.  Senator Packwood then opened a door,
ushered her into a room, and immediately closed the door.
The room was a small cubbyhole with a desk, a couch, and
some books, and possibly a chair.  Without warning, Senator
Packwood grabbed her by putting both hands in her hair, and
he pressed his body and face against her, pushing her up
against the desk.  He ran his hands through her hair, and
kissed her, sticking his tongue in her mouth.  Ms. Wagers
struggled to pull back, and to push him away with her hands.
Again, she started talking, saying that she thought she had
made it clear that she did not appreciate this type of
attention, that she would like to think that he would help
her if she needed help in her job, that she liked and
respected him very much, but she did not want this kind of
relationship.  She told him that she thought he understood
that, that she knew he was married, and she was now married,
and this was not what she wanted.  Senator Packwood again
told her that he loved her wholesomeness and her hair, that
he thought she was young and innocent, that he liked her
very much, and was very attracted to her.  He told her that
he could really help her with her job, he liked her so much,
and he did not want her to go.  He continued to try to kiss
her, but she kept turning her head and pushing him away.
She was anxious to make it clear that she did not want to do
anything, but at the same time, she did not want to offend
Senator Packwood.  When Senator Packwood reached toward a
pillow on the couch behind her, she was able to get away;
she stepped around him and left the office.

   This second incident had a devastating effect on her.  As
she had walked down the Capitol hallway with Senator
Packwood, she had felt very good, as if she had finally made
something of herself, and shed the blond stereotype.  She
had gotten a serious job, her first job with responsibility.
She was pleased that she had a formal relationship with a
Senator, that if she needed help, he would help her, and
that she could be taken seriously. When Senator Packwood
grabbed her, all of her confidence in herself died.  She
felt betrayed.  She felt that she had not done anything to
encourage Senator Packwood, and yet he still touched her
without her consent.  She did not feel that she would be
able to work effectively after that with members of
Congress, or that she could be anywhere where she would see
Senator Packwood.  She eventually resigned from the
Department of Labor.  She believes that this second assault
was a contributing factor to her decision to resign, that
part of the reason she stopped working was because she was
afraid to be around men, and she was specifically afraid of
Senator Packwood.  Since then, she has not had any kind of
business career; she has done menial work for a few months
for an agency that was going out of business, and she has
taught dance, which is what she does now.

   She believes that she has been hurt in every possible way
by the incidents with Senator Packwood - that emotionally,
financially, and intellectually she has remained frozen in
time. She is now divorced, and needs to go back to work, but
since she has-not worked since the early 1980's, she does
not have the background or credentials she needs to get a
good job.  Her only experience has been on Capitol Hill, and
she cannot get a job there now because of her fear, her lack
of working experience, and the media coverage of the
incidents.

       2.   Corroborating Witnesses

   The staff has interviewed two persons who recall that Ms.
Wagers told them, in the 1970's, that Senator Packwood
called her into his office, where he grabbed her and kissed
her, and stuck his tongue in her mouth.  One of these
witnesses was a co-worker with Ms. Wagers, in whom she
confided almost immediately after the incident.  He stated
that Ms. Wagers asked him to take a walk, and she related
the incident.  She was shocked, disgusted, and very upset.

   Four other former coworkers recalled that Ms. Wagers had
told them about the incident in varying degrees of vague
detail: one recalls that Ms. Wagers said she had had a
"contact" with Senator Packwood, which the witness had the
impression was a kiss; one recalls that Ms. Wagers said
Senator Packwood had made an unwanted advance; one recalls
that Ms. Wagers said that Senator Packwood had "hit on her ,
which he interpreted as a verbal come-on; one recalls that
Ms. Wagers vaguely indicated that "something happened" with
Senator Packwood.  One additional former coworker recalled
hearing from others that Senator Packwood had made a pass at
Ms. Wagers, although she had not heard about any aspect of
forcefulness.

   An additional witness, who worked with Ms. Wagers at the
Council on Wage and Price Stability, has a vivid
recollection of attending a "welcome home" ceremony for the
Iran hostages on the South Lawn of the White House.[fn 85]
The whole Council had been invited, and he walked over to
the ceremony with Ms. Wagers. When they arrived, he saw
Senator Packwood, and pointed him out to Ms. Wagers.
According to him, Ms. Wagers had a visible, physical
negative reaction; he believes that she recoiled, and
changed the direction that she was walking.  She indicated
to him that she did not want Senator Packwood to see her.
When he inquired what had happened, she told him that she
used to work for Senator Packwood, and that he had attacked
her.  He does not recall that Ms. Wagers gave him any more
specific details of the incident.  A year or so later, Ms.
Wagers told this same witness that she had run into Senator
Packwood in the Capitol, and that he had pushed her into a
room in the "catacombs" where he pushed her on a couch and
tried to have his way with her.

   The staff has also interviewed another friend of Ms.
Wagers, whom she met in 1988 or 1989.  During the course of
talking about their job histories and career experiences,
she told him that she had worked for Senator Packwood and
that he had called her into her office and tried to kiss her
on the neck; she tried to resist, and made it clear that she
was not interested.  Ms. Wagers also told him that a few
years later, she ran into Senator Packwood in the basement
of the Capitol building; that they engaged in conversation,
and Ms. Wagers was pleased that he took an interest in her.
He then led her into an unmarked office, closed the door,
tried to push her against furniture or a wall, and tried to
fondle her.  Ms. Wagers told him that she had been extremely
upset by the incident.

   The staff also took the deposition of another former
staffer, a friend of Ms. Wagers, who testified that in 1975
or 1976, Ms. Wagers told him that Senator Packwood had
called her into his office late in the work day, and had
embraced and kissed her.  She seemed upset and distressed
about the incident.  Later, in 1980 or 1981, Ms. Wagers, who
was working for the Labor Department at the time, told him
that she had seen Senator Packwood on the Hill, and that
they had been walking down a hallway when he ushered her
into a room off the hall[fn 86], and embraced her and kissed
her.  She appeared upset and distressed about this incident.

   In addition, Tim Lee, a former staffer, testified that
she told him when they were dating that Senator Packwood had
kissed her.  Another former staffer testified that she had
also told him, when he worked for Senator Packwood, that
Senator Packwood had called her into his office and kissed
her, and that she had left in tears.

    3.   Senator Packwood's Response     

      Senator Packwood recalled that Ms. Wagers worked in
his office in the mid-1970's.  He remembered her as young,
blond, and personable; he did not recall her duties in the
office.  He did not recall ever being alone with her when
she worked for him.  He did not recall the first incident as
described by Ms. Wagers, nor did he recall ever kissing her
while she worked for him.

   Senator Packwood did not recall the incident that Ms.
Wagers claims occurred in 1981 in the basement of the
Capitol.  He stated that he did have a Capitol office, that
he did not recall where it was, but it was not in the
basement.  He recalled that she came back to an office party
after she left his office, with Mr. Lee, a staffer whom she
was dating at the time.  He recalled that she was friends
with people in the office, and that she dated another
staffer when she worked in the office.

   Senator Packwood testified that Mimi Dawson, his former
administrative assistant, told him that Ms. Wagers had come
to her and told her that she thought Senator Packwood wanted
to have an affair with her, and that she was considering
whether she should do so.  In fact, Ms. Dawson testified
that Ms. Wagers had approached her and told her that she
thought the Senator wanted to have an affair with her, and
that she got the impression that Ms. Wagers was asking her
whether she thought she should have the affair.  She
testified:

"A:   I got the impression she was asking me whether I
thought she should have the affair or not.

Q:  And what was there that gave you that impression?

A:  Just I didn't get a sense that she was complaining
about, but trying to work through something, what should she
do.  I kind of had the feeling that it was more like this
big, important person wants to have an affair with her. Will
I offend him if I don't have this affair with him, or do I
want to have this affair with him.  I don't think she knew.
And I got the impression she was asking me for my
counsel."[fn 87]

   Senator Packwood's diary for December 14, 1992, contains
the following entry, recounting his conversation with Ms.
Dawson:

"Then there was the Paige Wagers incident.  It happened in
'76.  Mimi was press secretary.[fn 88]  Alan was AA.  Paige,
and Mimi sort of remembers this pretty specifically, Paige
came to Mimi and said something like "I think the Senator
wants to have an affair with me and what do you think I
should do about it." Mimi got the very definite impression
that Paige wanted to have the affair with me.  Mimi says she
remembers telling Paige, "Well, you're both consenting
adults.  Do what you want but I would suggest you go off and
get married."

   Senator Packwood did not recall that Ms. Wagers ever said
or did anything to suggest to him that she was interested in
any type of romantic or sexual relationship with him.

         4.   Findings

   Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incidents as alleged
by Ms. Wagers in fact occurred.  Her account of both
incidents has been corroborated by numerous witnesses who
recall that she told them about one or both incidents, in
varying amounts of detail, shortly after they occurred.
Senator Packwood has not denied the incidents, but has
stated that he simply does not have any recollection of
them.

   Senator Packwood has attempted to suggest that Ms.
Wagers, after the first incident, was entertaining the
possibility of an affair with him, based upon her
conversation with Ms. Dawson, possibly indicating that his
advances, if they occurred, were not unwelcome.  Counsel,
however, views this conversation as an attempt by a very
junior staff member to discreetly and circumspectly seek the
advice of a woman supervisor.  Senator Packwood himself has
testified that Ms. Wagers never said or did anything that
led him to conclude that she was interested in a sexual
relationship with him.

   Moreover, the tone of Ms. Wagers's comments when she
related these incidents to others clearly indicated that she
was upset by them, not that she was considering whether to
have an affair with the Senator.

   Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's
conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that
reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of
conduct that constitutes improper c~onduct reflecting upon
the Senate.

   E.   Eugenia Hutton

     1.   Testimony of Eugenia Hutton

   In November of 1979, Eugenia Hutton responded to a fund-
raising letter written by Gloria Steinem by contributing
money to Senator Packwood's campaign.  A few weeks later,
Brad Stocks, a Packwood staff member contacted her and asked
if she would be willing to be involved in the campaign,
clipping newspapers or something of that nature.  Ms. Hutton
indicated that she would be interested, and Mr. Stocks met
with her for coffee when he came to Eugene.  Later, Mr.
Stocks called her and asked if she would be interested in
being the chairperson for Lane County.  Ms. Hutton responded
that she had no experience in that sort of thing, but Mr.
Stocks indicated that they could teach her what she needed
to know.  She told Mr. Stocks that she was interested in the
opportunity.  Senator Packwood then called her on the
telephone to congratulate her for being on his campaign, to
tell her that he knew she could handle the job and would do
a great job, and that they could teach her everything she
needed to know.

   Subsequently, Ms. Hutton hosted coffees and volunteer
functions at her house, which were attended by Senator
Packwood as well as his wife, Georgie.  As the campaign
intensified, Ms. Hutton travelled to volunteer functions and
appearances with the Senator.

   In about March, 1980, Ms. Hutton went to the restaurant
at the Red Lion Inn on Coburg Road in Eugene, Oregon, to
meet with Senator Packwood and Mimi Dawson, his chief of
staff.  Senator Packwood was going to Coos Bay the next day,
and wanted to prepare for that, and he also wanted Ms.
Hutton to meet his chief of staff.  Ms. Hutton arrived at
the restaurant in the early evening, about 5:30 or 6:00, and
sat in a booth with Senator Packwood and two staff members,
Mr. Stocks and Bob Witeck.  Ms. Dawson arrived and sat down
at the booth, where she was introduced to Ms. Hutton.  They
chatted for a while, and Ms. Dawson left.

   After a while, Senator Packwood asked the other staff
members at the table to leave.  There was teasing from the
staff members, who told Senator Packwood that they were
going to stay and hang around with him.  Ms. Hutton had the
impression that the staff members were staying at the table
on purpose.  Senator Packwood became more firm in his
suggestions that the staff members leave.  Finally, Senator
Packwood made it clear that he wanted himself and Ms. Hutton
to be left alone, and everyone left.  Ms. Hutton recalls
that the Senator may have been drinking, although she does
not recall that he had any difficulty in walking.  She does
not remember if she had anything to drink, although she
could have.

   As they sat in the booth, the Senator asked her questions
about herself.  Ms. Hutton, assuming that Senator Packwood
wanted to get to know her, as his Lane County chairperson,
talked about herself, and showed him photographs of her
children and cats; when she showed him the pictures, he
moved closer to her in the booth, shoulder to shoulder.  Ms.
Hutton felt a little uncomfortable, but assumed that he had
moved over to look at the pictures.  She felt special,
because she thought that the Senator was truly interested in
getting to know her, as his Lane County chairperson, without
everyone else around.

   After about twenty minutes to half an hour, it was time
to leave, and Senator Packwood offered to walk Ms. Hutton to
her car.  When they got to her car, Ms. Hutton unlocked it.
Senator Packwood pulled her toward him, put his arms around
her back and kissed her, putting his tongue in her mouth.
Ms. Hutton pushed away from him, and acted as if she were
trying to protect him: she told him that it was too
dangerous to do that in public, that the press could be
anywhere.  She told him to get in her car, and she would
drive him to his room, which was at the Red Lion Inn.
Senator Packwood got in the car.

   As Ms. Hutton drove the Senator to his room, which was
across the parking lot and around the corner, he asked her
to come to his room with him.  She remembers that he said
things to the effect of, "Come into the room with me; do you
have to go home so soon; couldn't you come on in; couldn't
you just sit and be with me for a while; it won't hurt
anything."  She told Senator Packwood that it would look
very bad if someone were to see them, that they had a busy
day ahead, and that he had been drinking.  Senator Packwood
tried a few more times to convince her to come in.  He told
her that it was okay, it would be fine. She told him that
she thought he was a wonderful man, but that it was wrong
for her to come into his room.  Finally, he nodded, said
okay, and got out of her car, and she drove away.

   Ms. Hutton started to cry as she reached the street.  She
felt humiliated, confused, and angry.  She was angry at
Senator Packwood for being offensive and inappropriate, and
angry at herself for trying to save his feelings at the
expense of her own.

   Ms. Hutton saw Senator Packwood the next day, when she
went to the campaign trailer in the parking lot.  Although
no words were spoken about the night before, she and the
Senator exchanged a long look when she walked in.

   Ms. Hutton continued to work as the Lane County campaign
chairperson, and Senator Packwood was friendly and
respectful towards her; the incident was never mentioned.
Ms. Hutton describes their relationship as being a little
more businesslike after that incident.

   Ms. Hutton continued to work for Senator Packwood's
campaign through November of 1980.  In 1981, Ms. Hutton
asked Senator Packwood to write a letter of recommendation
for her, which he did.  When Ms. Hutton was starting a
business that did artwork on T-shirts, she sent Senator
Packwood a T-shirt, and he wrote her a thank you note.

      2.   Corroborating Witnesses

   The staff interviewed Ms. Hutton's sister and a close
personal friend who related that Ms. Hutton told them about
the incident in 1980 and 1989, respectively.

      3.   Senator Packwood's Response

   Senator Packwood recalled that Ms. Hutton was his Lane
County Campaign Chair in 1980, and one of his two principal
campaign workers for the next six years.  She had made a
contribution to his campaign in response to a direct mail
piece, and someone on his staff interviewed her to see if
she would be interested in working on his campaign.  She
attended a campaign volunteer kickoff, a two-day seminar, in
January, 1980 in Portland, where Senator Packwood first met
her.

   Senator Packwood also recalled a meeting that took place
at the Roadway hotel in Eugene, Oregon in March, 1980.[fn
89]  Ms. Hutton, a staffer, his administrative assistant,
possibly another staffer, and himself, had drinks and
dinner.  He did not recall what the group discussed during
the several hours they were there, or that Ms. Hutton showed
him any photographs.  He did not recall how the group broke
up.  He did recall that afterwards, he walked Ms. Hutton to
her car and kissed her.  He did not recall what time that
was, whether he was drunk at the time, how it was that he
came to walk her to her car, or what everyone else did when
he left.

   He did recall that when they got to Ms. Hutton's car, she
got her keys out, turned around, and he kissed her
goodnight.  He did not recall if it was a french kiss, or
whether he put his arms around her.  Although he did not
recall what Ms. Hutton did, he stated that she was "not
unreceptive," meaning that she did not push him away and
tell him to quit; she did not kiss him back.  He recalled
that she got in her car and left, and he walked back to his
room.

   Senator Packwood stated that the next day was very full.
Ms. Hutton was very excited and enthusiastic, and had the
crew to lunch at her house.  About 4:00 or 5:00 that
afternoon, when it was-time to go on to the next town, they
dropped Ms. Hutton off in a parking lot, or somewhere where
she had her car.  As Ms. Hutton got out of the van, and they
all said goodbye, she kissed the Senator on the lips as he
stood in the van by the door.  It was not a french kiss, or
a passionate kiss, or the kind of a kiss you would have if
you were dating someone, but not a peck on the cheek kiss
either.[fn 90]

   Ms. Hutton was very active in Senator Packwood's 1980
campaign.  He related a specific instance where Ms. Hutton
met the traveling crew one evening in Eugene, and they had
wine and pizza, and played charades until about 11:00 p.m.
He recalled that in 1983 or 1984, Ms. Hutton sent him a
T-shirt from her new business; she wanted Elaine Franklin to
loan or invest some money in the business.  They kept up a
close relationship for six years, and she was active in his
1986 campaign.  Senator Packwood could not recall any other
instances where he kissed Ms. Hutton, or she kissed him; he
could not recall anything Ms. Hutton ever said or did to
lead him to believe that she was interested in a romantic or
sexual relationship with him.[fn 91]

   Senator Packwood was asked about his statements to the
media in January, 1992, where he reportedly acknowledged
that he had french kissed Ms. Hutton, and propositioned her
or asked her to go to bed.  He stated that he had not said
that, that he had only said that he would not challenge her
word.  He stated that he wanted the press to accept her
claims as true for the sake of argument, but to also
consider Ms. Hutton's conduct toward him after the alleged
incident.

     Senator Packwood was asked about his reported comments
to the Albany Rotary Club, that Ms. Hutton had kissed him
many times after the alleged incident.  He stated that he
only recalled Ms. Hutton kissing him one time, and that he
may have overstated this to the Rotary Club.

     4.   Findings

   Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incident as alleged
by Ms. Hutton in fact occurred.  Ms. Hutton's account has
been corroborated by two persons to whom she related the
incident, albeit several years later.  Senator Packwood has
also admitted the incident, although his recollection of
some details differs from that of Ms. Hutton, and he cannot
recall some details, for example, whether he gave her a
french kiss.

   Senator Packwood has emphasized to the Committee that Ms.
Hutton continued to work for his campaign, and kept up a
warm and close relationship with him for many years after
the incident. He also claimed that after the incident, as
Ms. Hutton prepared to part company with the group, she gave
him a kiss.  His diary entry for that day also reflects that
she hugged and kissed each of the group.  As Senator
Packwood appears to admit that the incident took place, it
appears that he intends to suggest by this information that
Ms. Hutton could not have been offended by his behavior.
Again, the fact that Ms. Hutton continued to work on Senator
Packwood's campaigns, and that she kept up a relationship
with him, a fact confirmed by Ms. Hutton herself, does not
necessarily indicate that Ms. Hutton was not offended by
Senator Packwood's conduct.  It just as easily may reflect
Ms. Hutton' 8 inability to do anything about the incident,
and her recognition of Senator Packwood's position as a
United States Senator.

   Senator Packwood has also proffered a statement from one
John Morrison, indicating that Ms. Hutton acted in such a
fashion as to suggest that she was interested in a sexual
relationship with the Senator.  However, Senator Packwood
himself has testified that Ms. Hutton never did or said
anything to suggest that she was interested in a sexual
relationship with him. Moreover, such information, even if
true, does not establish that the incident did not occur,
although it would tend to indicate that she was not offended
by his earlier conduct.

   Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's
conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that
reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of
conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon
the Senate.

   F.   Gillian Butler

     1.   Testimony of Gillian Butler

   In January, 1979, Gillian Butler began working as a desk
clerk at the Red Lion Inn at 310 Southwest Lincoln Street,
Portland, Oregon.  She worked there, either full-time or
part- time, until May of 1983.  During those years, Senator
Packwood stayed at the Red Lion Inn for several days every
few months, with more frequent visits in 1980 during his
re-election campaign .

    In early 1980, Ms. Butler wrote letters to various
Congress persons to protest the reinstatement of the
registration for the draft.  She received a response from
Senator Packwood's office, addressed to "Mr. Butler."  Not
long afterwards, on a Saturday in February, Ms. Butler was
working at the front desk when she noticed that Senator
Packwood was checking out.  She commented to him to the
effect that the next time his office sent her a letter, it
should not be addressed to Mr. Butler.  When Senator
Packwood asked what she meant, she explained about the
response to her letter.  They discussed the draft for about
ten minutes, and Senator Packwood left for the airport.
Senator Packwood called her from the airport and told her to
write another letter, and he gave her the name of a person
to whom the letter should be addressed so that it would get
to him personally.  He told her that they would talk about
it the next time he visited Portland.

   Ms. Butler wrote a second letter to Senator Packwood
regarding her concerns about the draft, and left a copy for
him at the Red Lion Inn in case he came to Portland before
he got the letter in the mail in Washington.  She put her
home telephone number in the letter.

   About the end of February, 1980, Senator Packwood called
Ms. Butler at home about 7:30 a.m.  He told her that he was
flying into Portland that night, and he asked her to meet
him at 10:00 that evening at the Red Lion Inn, so that they
could go to a bar called the Prima Donna across the street,
to talk about her letter.  Ms. Butler agreed, although she
felt a bit uncomfortable about going to a bar with the
Senator that late at night.  She arranged for her boyfriend
to show up at the bar about 11:00 so that she would have a
ride home.

   That evening, Ms. Butler met Senator Packwood as planned,
and they went to the Prima Donna.  Ms. Butler and Senator
Packwood sat and talked about some of the issues set out in
her letter, mostly about international affairs and
international aggression.  She recalls that the Senator
asked her to dance, and although she thinks that she
refused, she may have danced briefly with him.  About 11:00,
Ms. Butler's boyfriend showed up, and the three of them
talked for another 45 minutes.  Ms. Butler's boyfriend and
Senator Packwood got into a heated political discussion
about international aggression.  Senator Packwood then got
up and left.

   Sometime later in 1980, Senator Packwood came in one day,
she believes on a Sunday, when Ms. Butler was working at the
Red Lion Inn.  The Senator asked Ms. Butler to join him in
the hotel lounge after she got off work.  She told him that
she had plans to meet her boyfriend, but the Senator told
her that her boyfriend was also invited.  When Ms. Butler
got off work at 11:00, she and her boyfriend went to the
lounge, where they saw Senator Packwood sitting at a table
with a woman; both of them appeared to be drunk.  Ms. Butler
and her boyfriend stood by the table and talked to the
couple for about five minutes, and then left.

   Later in 1980 or early in 1981, Ms. Butler was working at
the Red Lion Inn one morning when Senator Packwood came to
the front desk.  She was leaning over some paperwork,
checking Senator Packwood out of the hotel.  She looked up,
and Senator Packwood suddenly leaned across the desk and
kissed her on the mouth.  She was surprised, uncomfortable,
and embarrassed, and backed away.

   Later in 1980 or early in 1981, Senator Packwood came to
the front desk one morning at the Red Lion Inn when Ms.
Butler was working.  He was leaving and wanted his luggage,
which was stored in the closet behind the desk.  Ms. Butler
told him that she would get his luggage, and turned around
and went to the closet. Senator Packwood walked around the
desk and into the closet behind her.  When she turned
around, he leaned over and kissed her, got his luggage, and
left.

   After these incidents, Ms. Butler was careful not to be
alone behind the desk when the Senator was there; she made
sure that there was another clerk behind the desk when she
knew the Senator was coming down.

     2.   Corroborating Witnesses

      The staff interviewed four persons - Ms. Butler's
parents, her sister, and her boyfriend at the time - who
confirm that Ms. Butler told them about the incidents, in
varying degrees of detail, shortly after they occurred.  Her
boyfriend at the time recalls accompanying Ms. Butler to the
hotel bar to meet Senator Packwood, where they found him in
a booth, intoxicated, with a woman.  They stayed for a few
minutes to talk, and left.

    Another friend of Ms. Butler's, who ran as a Socialist
Workers Party write-in candidate against Senator Packwood in
1980, stated that, shortly after the incidents happened, Ms.
Butler told him about two occasions when Senator Packwood
kissed her while she was working at the Red Lion Inn.  She
also told him that Senator Packwood had asked her out for
drinks several times. On one occasion, Ms. Butler called him
to tell him that she was going to meet Senator Packwood at a
bar, and that unbeknownst to Senator Packwood, she was
bringing her boyfriend along; he learned from Ms. Butler
later that they had talked about military spending and
policy.

3.   Senator Packwood's Response

    Senator Packwood recalled Ms. Butler as a desk clerk at
the Red Lion Inn, where he stayed in Portland.  They chatted
when he checked in and out; she was anti-war, anti-draft,
and anti-military.  He recalled discussing a letter with
her, in which she said that he should feel free to call her
at home, which he did. He suggested that Ms. Butler meet
with him to talk about the letter.  He recalled that he met
with her only once, at the bar in the motel.  The Senator
was with someone, and Ms. Butler came with her boyfriend.
They chatted awhile; he believed that Ms. Butler and her
boyfriend remained standing.

    Senator Packwood did not recall any other meetings or
contacts with Ms. Butler.  He stated that it would have been
difficult for him to lean over the counter and kiss her,
because the counter is about four feet high and three feet
wide.

4.   Findings

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incidents as
alleged by Ms. Butler in fact occurred.  Senator Packwood
recalled Ms. Butler, but he did not recall the incidents
themselves.  Senator Packwood has offered no evidence, other
than his claim that it would be difficult to lean over the
counter as described by Ms. Butler, to refute these
allegations, nor has the Committee uncovered any such
evidence.  The claims are corroborated by the persons to
whom Ms. Butler spoke at the time of or shortly after the
incidents, and who, in the case of her then-boyfriend,
participated in some of the events leading up to the
incidents.

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's
conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that
reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of
conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon
the Senate.

    G.   Packwood Staff Member[fn 92]

          1.   Testimony of Staff Member

    This individual worked on Senator Packwood's personal
staff from September of 1978 through August of 1979, when
she returned to school.  She then worked for the Senate
Commerce Committee, where Senator Packwood was the ranking
minority member, from June, 1980 through August, 1980.

     One day in May of 1979, when the staffer was in Senator
Packwood's office with a number of other staffers, he leaned
over and told her in effect that he would like to see her
playing softball in the dress she was wearing, bending over,
or moving in certain positions, so that he could see her
figure.  He made comments about how the dress fit her, and
how she would look playing softball or pitching if she were
wearing the dress, and said that he would like to be there
to watch her move.

    Sometime later, when the staffer was on the Committee
staff, one evening six or seven of the staff, and Senator
Packwood, went to a restaurant for pizza and beer.  While
they all sat around a table, Senator Packwood put his arm
around the staffer, drew her very close, and told her he
knew that he could persuade her to be a Republican.  He kept
his arm around her most of the evening.

    These instances with the Senator made the staffer very
uncomfortable about being in a position where something
similar might happen again.  She wanted to avoid Senator
Packwood, but at the same time, she wanted to have her work
recognized by him.

    One evening in the early summer of 1980, the staffer was
working in the Senator's office, and she realized she would
be the last staff member working in the office.[fn 93] She
was apprehensive about what might happen, given the other
instances that had occurred, and she wanted an excuse to
leave the office. About 7:00 or 7:30, she called a friend
and asked him to drive over and come upstairs to the offices
to get her.  After making the phone call, the staffer walked
back into the Senator's office.  He came around his desk,
and either rubbed her back or put his arm around her.  He
then grabbed her shoulders, and tried to push her down on
the couch.  He kissed her on the lips.  She tried to get up,
and he pushed her down again; this happened three times,
maybe more.  She tried to push him away, and told him to
leave her alone, not to touch her, and that she had a friend
coming to pick her up.

    As the staffer struggled with Senator Packwood, her
friend arrived at the office and began calling her name.
The staffer was able to get away from the Senator, and
locate her friend, whom she introduced to the Senator as her
boyfriend.[fn 94] The staffer and her friend then left the
office.  The staffer was upset and crying, and spent some
time walking around the Capitol with her friend, whom she
told what had happened before he took her home.

    After that, the staffer avoided the Senator  like the
plague."  She left the office at the end of August.

          2.   Corroborating Witnesses

    In his deposition, the friend whom the staffer called
the evening of the incident in Senator Packwood's office
confirms that she called him to pick her up from work one
evening, that she was upset and crying, and that she told
him that Senator Packwood had been making advances or passes
at her, and that it was not the first time it had
happened.[fn 95]

   3.   Senator Packwood's Response

    Senator Packwood did not recall the staffer, or the
incidents that she alleges occurred.

    4.   Findings

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incident as alleged
by the staff member in fact occurred.  Senator Packwood has
testified that he does not recall the incident.  The staff
member's allegations have been corroborated by the friend
whom she called to pick her up on the evening that the
incident occurred.  Senator Packwood has offered no
evidence, nor has the Committee found any, that would tend
to refute the allegation by the staff member.

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's
conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that
reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of
conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon
the Senate.

    H.   Senate Staff Member[fn 96]

      1.   Testimony of Staff Member

    In 1979, this individual worked for another Senator, in
an office on the first floor of the Dirksen Building, Room
1200. The office was only one room, in which six to seven
persons worked.  A corner of the room, in the front to the
right of the door, was partitioned by a cubicle; the staff
member sat at a desk in this cubicle.  The office was
located around the corner from the Senate elevators, and at
the corner of the building, near an outside entrance.  It
was an interior office with no windows, and the door was
customarily kept open.  Senators often passed by on their
way to the subway or across the street to vote.

    Senator Packwood passed by frequently, and at some point
got in the habit of stopping in the office to chat with the
staff member.  She was friendly to Senator Packwood when he
dropped in their conversation was superficial, in the nature
of  Hello, how are you, are you having a good day,- etc.
The staff member cannot remember Senator Packwood talking
with anyone else in the office other than her when he came
in.

    It was not uncommon for the staff member to be in her
office alone after the rest of the staff had gone home for
the evening. She was often at the office until 6:00 or 7:00
p.m., alone, catching up on the mail.  One evening, as best
as she can recall, in 1979, possibly in the spring, the
staff member was working late, alone in the office.  She was
sitting at her desk proofing mail, with mail in her lap and
her feet up on the feet of the swivel chair, leaning back
comfortably.  Senator Packwood came in the office, and stood
three or four feet away, chatting.  All of a sudden, he
lunged down, kissed her on the lips, and turned around and
left without saying a word.  She stated that the kiss was
not a french kiss. but it was a full kiss on the mouth. It
was not like a kiss from a grandfather, nor was it a
romantic kiss.  The staff member described the kiss as
unwanted, and stated that she felt violated by Senator
Packwood approaching her in that manner.

    The staff member did not notice any odor of alcohol
about Senator Packwood.  She does not have a specific
recollection of Senator Packwood placing his hands on her
shoulders or on the chair, but she states that he would have
had to brace his arms either on her shoulders or on the
chair in order to be able to push himself away from her.

    After that, the staff member started closing the office
door.  Senator Packwood did not stop by the office anymore,
nor did he speak to her.

    2.   Corroborating Witnesses

    Two witnesses, the staff member's boyfriend and a friend
from the Senate, both recalled that, sometime after the
allegations became public, the staff member told them that
Senator Packwood had come into her office and kissed her.

    3.   Senator Packwood's Response

    Senator Packwood could not recall the staff member, or
the incident that she alleges occurred.

   4.   Findings

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incident as alleged
by the staff member in fact occurred.  Senator Packwood did
not recall the incident; he has not offered, nor has the
Committee uncovered, any evidence tending to refute the
staff member's allegation.

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's
conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that
reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of
conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon
the Senate.

    I.   Kerry Whitney

        1.   Testimony of Kerry Whitney

    Ms. Whitney worked for the Senate in Washington, D.C.
from approximately September, 1976 through October, 1978, as
a part time elevator operator on the Senate side of the
Capitol, running the elevators from 8:00 a.m. until 1:00
p.m., unless there were scheduled sessions that started
earlier, in which case she started work earlier.  The rest
of the day, she worked in a Senator's office.  Her job as an
elevator operator involved standing by her assigned elevator
and transporting passengers to their requested floor.  For
the first nine months, she was assigned to operate one of
the elevators available for use by the public; the last two
of those months she was assigned to the public elevator that
also served as the alternate Senators' only elevator.  She
was then assigned to the Senators' only elevator, which she
operated for eight months, and then to the Senators' only
elevator which went to the Senate dining room.  She remained
there until she left her job.

    Ms. Whitney first came to know Senator Packwood when she
was assigned to operate the alternate Senators  elevator in
approximately April 1977.  He was always friendly and
attentive, and expressed an interest in her as a person,
asking her questions about herself, and remembering her
name.  Ms. Whitney was flattered by this attention from a
U.S. Senator.  For about the first few months after she met
Senator Packwood, her interaction with him was limited to
friendly conversation on the elevator.

      Sometime during June or July, 1977, after she had been
assigned to operate the Senators' only elevator in the main
corridor, Senator Packwood entered the elevator, and greeted
her by name.  As soon as the doors closed, he suddenly
cocked his head to the side, and said "kiss."  He grabbed
her by the shoulders, pushed her back to the side wall of
the elevator, and started kissing her on the lips.  He
stopped as the elevator came to a halt.  After that, Senator
Packwood grabbed and kissed her most of the times when he
was alone with her on the elevator. Frequently he would
precede the kiss by cocking his head and saying "kiss"
before he grabbed her.

    Some time in late July, 1977, Senator Packwood asked Ms.
Whitney where she lived, and for her telephone number,
saying he might like to come over some evening.  She gave
him the information, thinking that if she had the
opportunity to talk with him, she could get him to stop the
kissing and have just a friendly relationship.  One evening
in early August, 1977, Senator Packwood called Ms. Whitney
at home about 9:30 p.m. and asked if he could come over.
Ms. Whitney was surprised, but also flattered.  Because her
roommate and a Russian friend of hers were also home, she
said yes.  Senator Packwood arrived a short time later,
knocked on the door, and she let him into the vestibule.  He
appeared to her nervous, and she smelled alcohol on his
breath.  Senator Packwood heard voices from the living room,
asked who it was, and backed away from the entrance into the
living room.  When Ms. Whitney told him it was her roommate
and a Russian student, he said  a Russian" and jumped behind
the door to the living room.  He then walked into the living
room and introduced himself.

    Senator Packwood asked Ms. Whitney what she had to
drink. She went to the kitchen; he followed her.  She gave
the Senator a beer.  He put his beer on the counter, put his
arms around her and began kissing her.  She put her hands on
his chest, pushed him away, and said, wait a minute, what do
you want from me7  He stated that he wanted two things from
her:  to make love to her and to hear what she heard in her
job, as she heard a lot of things.  Ms. Whitney was stunned,
and asked him if he weren't married.  He responded that he
was, and he loved his wife very much.  Ms. Whitney told him
that she was not interested in having sex with him.

    Senator Packwood then suggested that they sit down
somewhere.  They went to the back yard, and sat around a
table for about thirty minutes while Senator Packwood drank
his beer. Ms. Whitney does not recall much of the
conversation, other than the Senator saying that they had a
special relationship that they would have forever, and they
were obviously attracted to each other.  He indicated that
he had a campaign coming up, giving Ms. Whitney the
impression that he was dangling the opportunity to work in
his campaign in front of her.

    It began to rain, so they went back into the house.  Ms.
Whitney's roommate and her friend had left.  Ms. Whitney and
Senator Packwood went into the living room and sat on the
couch, where the Senator again began trying to kiss her, and
repeatedly asked to spend the night.  Ms. Whitney kept
pushing him away, and declining his invitation to have sex,
saying that they should just talk.  She finally got up from
the couch, and told him he had to leave.  He continued to
beg her to let him spend the night, saying that he had
nowhere to go.  She suggested that he go home; he told her
it was too far away.  She then told him to go to his
secretary's house, as she understood he sometimes stayed
there.  He rejected that suggestion.  She finally told him
he would have to sleep in his office.  Eventually, she was
able to lead him out the door by his arm.

    About five minutes later, she heard a loud banging on
the door, which lasted about three minutes.  She did not
answer the door, as she believed it was the Senator.  About
ten minutes later, the phone rang.  It was Senator Packwood,
who asked why she had not answered the door; she told him
she was getting ready for bed.  He again begged her to
please let him spend the night, and she again refused.  She
saw him again the next morning at 7:00 a.m. by the
elevators, and he told her he had slept on the couch in his
office.

    After the incident at her house, Senator Packwood
continued to grab and kiss her when they were alone in the
elevator. Sometime in late August or early September, 1977,
after a kissing episode, she told Senator Packwood that his
touching was getting in the way, and asked if they could go
somewhere public and talk about it.  He told her that he
could not do that because he was married.

    In early September, 1977, Senator Packwood called her
house again.  Ms. Whitney was not home and her roommate
answered the phone.  Senator Packwood told her roommate that
it was too bad Ms. Whitney was not home, that he wanted her
to get a hamburger with him.  He then asked the roommate if
she wanted to go; she declined.

    After the second phone call, the grabbing and kissing
episodes on the elevator became less frequent, and
eventually ceased in late fall.  In February, 1978, Ms.
Whitney was reassigned to the Senators' only back elevator
which leads to the Senate dining room, and she did not see
Senator Packwood very much after that.  She does not have
any recollection of Senator Packwood grabbing and kissing
her during the time she ran the dining room elevator.

     2.   Corroborating Witnesses

    The staff has interviewed four witnesses who corroborate
portions of Ms. Whitney's allegations.  Her roommate at the
time, who is married to Ms. Whitney's brother, confirms that
Ms. Whitney told her that Senator Packwood had kissed her
numerous times in the elevator.  She also recalls the
evening that Senator Packwood came over to their apartment;
she recalls that she had a Russian student visiting, and
that after Senator Packwood greeted them, he and Ms. Whitney
went into the kitchen.  She recalls, however, that she and
the Russian student were still in the living room when
Senator Packwood left about an hour later.  She also recalls
that some time later, Senator Packwood called one evening
for Ms. Whitney, and when he learned that she was not at
home, he invited her out for dinner; she declined.

    A staffer who worked with Ms. Whitney in the Senator's
office at the time also recalls that Ms. Whitney told her
that Senator Packwood had made passes at her a number of
times when he was alone on the elevator with her, and that
he had come over to her house.

    Ms. Whitney's brother also recalled that while she
worked in the Senate, Ms. Whitney told him that Senator
Packwood had tried to kiss her on the elevator more than
once, and that he had showed up at her apartment and wanted
her to go out.

    A roommate of Ms. Whitney's in 1978, after she left the
Senate, recalled that Ms. Whitney told her that Senator
Packwood had pinned her and kissed her in the elevator, and
that he had come to her house and asked her for a date; he
jumped on her, and later pounded on her door and called her
on the telephone.

     3.   Senator Packwood's Response

    Senator Packwood did not recall Ms. Whitney or the
incidents she alleges occurred.  He did not recall ever
kissing or propositioning any Senate elevator operator.

    4.   Findings

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incidents as
alleged by Ms. Whitney in fact occurred.  Ms. Whitney's
allegations have been corroborated by the persons to whom
she described the incidents after they occurred, including
her roommate at the time, who personally observed Senator
Packwood when he came to their apartment, and who talked to
him when he called to ask Ms. Whitney to dinner.  Senator
Packwood has not denied the incidents, except to state that
he does not recall ever kissing a Senate elevator operator;
he has no recollection of the incidents described by Ms.
Whitney.  Senator Packwood has offered no evidence, nor has
the Committee uncovered any, that tends to refute the
allegations of Ms. Whitney.

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's
conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that
reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of
conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon
the Senate.

    J.   Jean McMahon

      1.   Testimony of Jean McMahon

    In 1976 or 1977, Jean McMahon heard that Senator
Packwood's staff office in Portland was looking for
additional staff members.  She was interested in moving to
Portland, so she called Senator Packwood's office to see if
she could get an appointment to talk about a job.  Within
several days, Senator Packwood called her, and told her that
he would like to meet her and possibly get some writing
samples from her.  She understood from the conversation that
Senator Packwood was looking for a speech writer.  They made
an appointment for an interview at a motel in Salem.  Ms.
McMahon thought it odd that the appointment was at a motel,
but assumed that the motel was a convenient place for a
traveling U.S. senator.

    Ms. McMahon met Senator Packwood at the motel as
arranged, and spoke with him for about an hour.  She was
attempting to get acquainted with the Senator, and to get
information from which she could prepare a draft of a speech
for him, so that he could see what her writing style was
like.

    Over the next few weeks, Ms. McMahon prepared a draft of
a speech, and talked to Senator Packwood by telephone
several times about different points in the speech.
Eventually, they agreed to meet again at the Dorchester
Conference, a well-known event among Republicans in Oregon.
Ms. McMahon took her drafts, and drove from Salem to the
coast, where the Dorchester Conference was taking place.
Senator Packwood had given her the address of a motel, with
a room number.  Ms. McMahon knocked on the door of the room,
and Senator Packwood answered; he was the only person in the
room.  She and the Senator sat at an oval table in a sitting
room area.  Ms. McMahon had her draft speech with her, and
she brought it out, gave the Senator a copy of it, and began
talking about it.  Within about five minutes, it became
obvious to her that the Senator was not at all interested in
her speech. The Senator got up quickly from the table, and
moved around toward her.  She became alarmed, got up, and
started to go around the edge of the table, in order to put
distance between herself and the Senator.  Senator Packwood
started moving faster, grabbed her by the shoulders, and
pulled her up to him and kissed her. She pulled away, and
quickly left the room.

    It took a few days for Ms. McMahon to realize that
Senator Packwood was not at all serious about hiring her as
a speech writer.  She called his office in Portland, to tell
them that she had a draft speech for the Senator, thinking
that someone on the staff was waiting for it.  She told
someone at the office that she had the draft speech ready
for the Senator, and she needed to know what to do with it.
The reaction from the staff at the Portland office was that
they had never heard of any speech, and they did not care
what happened to the draft she had prepared. Ms. McMahon
never spoke to Senator Packwood again.

     2.   Corroborating Witnesses

    The staff deposed six witnesses who learned about this
incident, in varying detail, from Ms. McMahon in the late
1970's. Her husband (they were dating at the time) recalled
receiving a phone call from Ms. McMahon after the incident;
he knew she had gone to deliver a speech to Senator
Packwood.  Ms. McMahon told him that Senator Packwood had
come on to her, and she had to leave.  Four close friends of
Ms. McMahon's also confirmed that she told them about the
incident, and the fact that she had been led to believe that
there was a job opening for a speechwriter. Ms. McMahon's
friends indicated that she seemed to be excited about the
prospect of the job, and had taken work for Senator Packwood
to review.  However, Senator Packwood appeared to have no
interest in her work, and used the opportunity to make an
unwanted physical advance upon her.  Three of these
witnesses recalled that Ms. McMahon told them that Senator
Packwood chased her around a table, or around the room, in
his hotel room.

     3.   Senator Packwood's Response

    Senator Packwood did not recall Ms. McMahon, or the
incident that she described.  He stated that it would be
unusual for him to consider a person for a job as a speech
writer, as he has never used one.  He writes his own
speeches, except for formal floor speeches on subjects with
which he is not familiar, which he has written for him by
staff members.

    There is an entry in Senator Packwood's diary for
February 16, 1977, indicating that he met with Ms. McMahon,
and that they might want to use her as a writer.[fn 97]
After his first deposition, Senator Packwood provided the
Committee with a draft of a speech that Ms. McMahon had
worked on for the Senator.  He testified at his second
deposition that he still had no recollection of Ms. McMahon,
but the speech appeared to be one that he gave her to edit,
probably to see if she would be able to write for him.  He
stated that looking at the speech, and the edits, Ms.
McMahon probably talked to him about the speech, but he had
no recollection of that.

    Senator Packwood testified that according to news
statements, Ms. McMahon had stated that she phoned his
office after the incident to see if she had gotten the job.

    4.   Findings

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incident as alleged
by Ms. McMahon in fact occurred.  Ms. McMahon's account is
corroborated by the persons to whom she described the
incident shortly after it occurred.  Several details of her
testimony are corroborated by Senator Packwood's own records
- her first meeting with him is reflected in both his diary
and his calendar of events, and the fact that he was
considering her for a position involving speechwriting is
confirmed by the speech she critiqued for him.

    Senator Packwood has not denied the incident; he has
testified that he has no recollection of it.  He did
emphasize in his deposition that Ms. McMahon was still
interested in working for him, as she had apparently called
his office after the incident to inquire about the job, as
if to suggest either that the incident did not occur, or
that she could not have been offended by it if she still
wanted to work for him.  The fact that Ms. McMahon may have
called to inquire about the job after the incident, even if
true, does not cast any doubt on Ms. McMahon's allegation.
If true, it may just as easily indicate that she was willing
to overlook the incident because she needed a job.

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's
conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that
reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of
conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon
the Senate.

    K.   Packwood Staff Member[fn 98]

       1.   Staff Member's Testimony

    This individual worked for Senator Packwood from March,
1972 through April, 1975 in Washington, D.C., as a staff
assistant. One evening, when the staff member was at a bar
with her husband and a friend, a staffer for another Senator
staff apparently overheard the staff member talking about
Senator Packwood, saying that he drank too much, and had to
have somebody drive him because of his drinking.  The next
day, Senator Packwood called her into his office and
confronted her with this information. The staff member,
worried about losing her job, denied that she had been
talking about Senator Packwood, and claimed that she had
been talking instead about her former boss.  Senator
Packwood told her that he did not think that she would say
anything about him, got up from behind his desk, and came
around and kissed her on the cheek.  The staff member
described the kiss as inappropriate, but without sexual
overtones.  She was relieved that she had not lost her job.

    Sometime after this incident, during the spring of 1975,
the staff member began riding to work with her husband,
whose job required him to be in his office early.
Consequently, the staff member would arrive at the office at
about 7:00 or 7:30 a.m.; she usually was the first one in to
work.  At some point, Senator Packwood started coming in to
the office early as well, and he and the staff member would
chat in the mornings in the office she shared with another
staff member.  One morning in April, 1975, as the staff
member stood in her office, engaging in small talk with
Senator Packwood, he grabbed her firmly with both arms
around her shoulders, held her tightly, pressing his body
into hers, and kissed her on the mouth.  She describes the
kiss as that of somebody who wanted to be involved or
passionate.  She pushed him away, and told him to get off of
her, that she was a happily married woman.  Senator Packwood
appeared bewildered, told her that he was sorry, and left
the room.

    The staff member quit her job, because she felt that
after the incident involving the kiss in her office, every
time she was around the Senator, he was looking at her, and
it made her uncomfortable.

     2.   Corroborating Witnesses

    The staff has interviewed one witness, the staff
member's aunt, who worked on the Hill at the time, who
confirmed that the staff member told her that she had to
leave Senator Packwood's employment, because she was afraid
to be alone in the office with him.  The staff member told
this witness that Senator Packwood had kissed her.

    The staff member's husband recalled that she told him,
eighteen or nineteen years ago, while she worked for Senator
Packwood, that someone had overheard a conversation among
himself, his wife, and a friend about Senator Packwood's
womanizing which they had reported to Senator Packwood.
Senator Packwood questioned the staff member about it, and
she denied having said anything.  Senator Packwood seemed
satisfied, and gave her a "wet" kiss on the lips.  Sometime
later, Senator Packwood and the staff member were in the
office early, and he grabbed her and kissed her.  At the
time, her husband was an officer with the Metropolitan
Police Department.  He was upset when his wife told him
about these incidents, but he was worried that it could
cause trouble for him or his wife if he mentioned anything
about the incidents.  Had it been anyone but a Senator, he
would have confronted the person about the incidents.

      3.   Senator Packwood's Response

    Senator Packwood did not recall the staff member or the
incident that she alleges occurred.

      4.   Findings

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incident as alleged
by the staff member in fact occurred.  Two witnesses have
confirmed that the staff member told them about the incident
shortly after it occurred.  Senator Packwood has not denied
the incident; he has testified that he did not recall it.
Senator Packwood has not offered, nor has the Committee
uncovered, any evidence tending to refute the staff member's
allegations.

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's
conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that
reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of
conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon
the Senate.

    L.   Packwood Staff Member[fn 99]

       1.   Testimony of Staff Member

    This individual worked for Senator Packwood in the early
1970's as a caseworker in his Senate office in Portland.
Sometime in the early 1970's, she was at work alone in one
of the office rooms late one night.  She testified that she
had been drinking, and it was possible that she had gone out
after work with some of the other staff and come back to the
office.  She was just finishing a telephone call when
Senator Packwood came in, and chased her around the desk
several times.  She does not remember Senator Packwood
saying anything to her, and she does not think that he
actually touched her.  She thinks that she was already
standing when Senator Packwood came into the room, but she
cannot remember what he did that made her suspicious and
made her try to get away from him; she believes that he must
have said something to her, although she does not remember
that.  At the time, she thought that all he was going to do
was to kiss her. She remembers that he chased her, and that
she went around the desk several times.  She was so upset
that she left the office without her purse and coat.  The
staff member continued to work in Senator Packwood's office
for a short time after that incident.

       2.   Corroborating Witnesses

    The staff member provided the names of two persons whom
she told about the incident.  The staff was not able to
contact either person.


       3.   Senator Packwood's Response

    Senator Packwood did not recall either the staff member,
or the incident that she alleges occurred.

       4.   Findings

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incident as alleged
by the staff member in fact occurred.  Although no witnesses
were found who could corroborate the staff member's account,
Senator Packwood did not deny the incident, nor did he offer
any evidence that would tend to refute her allegation.

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's
conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that
reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of
conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon
the Senate.

    M.   Gail Byler

1.   Testimony of Gail Byler

    In 1970, Gail Byler worked as the dining room hostess at
the Ramada Inn, which had opened in February, 1970 at 4th
and Lincoln in Portland, Oregon.  It is now a Red Lion Inn.
One evening in March, April, or May of 1970, she was sitting
at the hostess desk working on paperwork after the dining
room had closed for the evening.  The dining room was dark
except for a light that was on over the area where she was
working.  The dining room itself was open to the lobby area,
and was separated from the lounge by a screen.

    Ms. Byler got up from her station to get a glass of ice
water from the waitress station, which was in a hallway off
the dining room, fairly close to the entrance to the dining
room from the lobby.  She had her back to the dining room.
All of a sudden, she felt a hand go from her ankle, up the
inside of her leg, to her crotch.  She turned around
quickly, and saw Senator Packwood behind her, leaning
against a doorway.  She stepped back, and told him to stay
away from her, and not to touch her. He said, "Do you know
who I am?"  Ms. Byler told him that she knew who he was, she
didn't care, and for him to stay away from her.  He told her
that she had not heard the end of it, and walked out of the
dining room.

     2.   Corroborating Witnesses

    Ms. Byler's minister provided an affidavit to the
Committee. Ms. Byler has been a parishioner and a friend of
his for a number of years.

    The minister stated that shortly before the death of Ms.
Byler's husband about three years ago, he was at their home,
and he and her husband were teasing Ms. Byler about all of
the men who would be chasing after her when her husband
died.  Ms. Byler told them, in effect, that she had been
pursued by loftier men than the two of them.  She then told
them that years earlier, when she was working as the dining
room manager at the Ramada Inn, she had been  going over the
waitress slips in the diningroom after it had closed down.
She stepped into a waitress station for a glass of water,
and Senator Packwood came up behind her, and ran his hands
from her legs to her waist.  He appeared to her to have been
drinking.  She told him in no uncertain terms to get away
from her, and to leave her alone.

    After stories appeared in the newspapers about
allegations of misconduct by Senator Packwood, the minister
reminded Ms. Byler of their conversation several years
earlier.  Ms. Byler was reluctant to go forward or make any
kind of statement about what had happened to her.  Although
the minister felt that Senator Packwood had done good things
as a Senator, he also felt that it was important for this
information to become public.  He encouraged Ms. Byler to go
forward, and to make a statement about the incident.

     3.   Senator Packwood's Response

    Senator Packwood did not recall Ms. Byler, or the
incident that she alleges occurred.

     4.   Findings

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that this incident as
alleged by Ms. Byler in fact occurred.  Senator Packwood
does not recall this incident.  No evidence has been offered
by Senator Packwood or obtained by the Committee to refute
Ms. Byler's claim, and it is corroborated by her minister,
to whom she recounted the incident after it occurred.

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's
conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that
reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of
conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon
the Senate.

    N.   Packwood Staff Member[fn 100]

       1.   Testimony of Staff Member

    This individual worked for Senator Packwood for about
six months from April to October, 1970.  She worked at a
desk in the front office.  One afternoon, after 5:00, she
was sitting at her desk when Senator Packwood walked over,
grabbed her by the shoulders, and kissed her on the mouth.
It was not a french kiss, but it was a sexual kiss, the type
that a boyfriend would give to a girlfriend.  She believes
that she pushed Senator Packwood away, and tried to make a
joke out of it.  He walked away, and the incident did not
happen again.

       2.   Corroborating Witnesses

    The staff member could not recall telling anyone about
this incident.

       3.   Senator Packwood's Response

    Senator Packwood could not recall either the staff
member, or the incident that she alleges occurred.

       4.   Findings

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incident as alleged
by the staff member in fact occurred.  Although no witnesses
were found who could corroborate the staff member's account,
Senator Packwood did not deny the incident, nor did he offer
any evidence that would tend to refute her allegation.

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's
conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that
reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of
conduct that constitutes  improper conduct reflecting upon
the Senate.

    O.   Sharon Grant

        1.   Testimony of Sharon Grant

     In early 1969, sometime in the spring, Sharon Grant met
Senator Packwood at a reception on Capitol Hill, and she
talked with him about the possibility of working for his
office or one of his committees.  Senator Packwood told her
to come by and see him to discuss this possibility further.

    Within a week or two, Ms. Grant called someone in
Senator Packwood's office to set up an appointment to talk
to him.  She went to Senator Packwood's office toward the
end of a working day, and met with the Senator in his office
for about 45 minutes. Ms. Grant talked with the Senator
about herself, her work experience and interests, and job
possibilities.  Senator Packwood indicated to her that she
should consider filling out an application with his staff
people.  Toward the end of the meeting, Senator Packwood
suggested to Ms. Grant that they go and have a drink, and
asked her, how about spending the evening with me?  Ms.
Grant picked up a tone of voice, or a loaded quality to the
Senator's comments, that caused her to interpret his request
as a proposition for her to spend the night with him.  She
told him that she did not think that was appropriate, that
it was time for her to go, and she left.  She did not pursue
a job possibility any further.

      2.   Corroborating Witnesses

    There were no witnesses located who could corroborate
Ms. Grant's testimony.

      3.   Senator Packwood's Response

    Senator Packwood could not recall Ms. Grant, or the
incident that she alleges occurred.

      4.   Findings

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incident as alleged
by Ms. Grant in fact occurred.  Although no witnesses were
found who could corroborate Ms. Grant's account, Senator
Packwood did not deny the incident, nor did he offer any
evidence that would tend to refute her allegation.

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's
conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that
reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of
conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon
the Senate.

    P.   Gayle Rothrock

        1.   Testimony of Gayle Rothrock

    Gayle Rothrock worked for another Senator from December,
1968 until September of 1970.  During that time, she became
acquainted with Senator Packwood by virtue of her visits to
his office on business, or to say hello to acquaintances who
worked there.

    In early spring of 1969, probably early April, Ms.
Rothrock was visiting friends in Senator Packwood's office.
Mrs. Packwood was there, and Ms. Rothrock heard her say that
she needed a babysitter for one of the next few evenings for
their two preschool children.  Ms. Rothrock volunteered to
babysit, and on the evening in question, the Packwoods
picked her up after work and took her to their home.  She
took care of the children for the evening while the
Packwoods attended an event.  When the Senator and his wife
returned about 11:00 p.m., they paid her for babysitting,
and Mrs. Packwood told her that the Senator would run her
home.

    As Ms. Rothrock was reaching for her coat from an area
close to the front door, Senator Packwood grabbed her
shoulders and back with both of his hands, rubbed and
massaged her shoulders and back, and gave her a sloppy,
forceful, wet and insistent kiss on the mouth.  Ms. Rothrock
pushed him away with her hands, retrieved her coat, and
started talking about Northwest issues, what a nice family
he had and how attractive the children were, how she hoped
that his days in Washington were going to be good ones, and
that he was off to a good start.

    Although Ms. Rothrock detected a slight odor of alcohol
about Senator Packwood, and the Packwoods had told her they
had been to a party where there were drinks and hors
d'oeuvres, neither of the Packwoods displayed signs of
drunkenness.

    Ms. Rothrock sat in the front seat during the ride to
her apartment.  As he started the car engine, and before he
pulled away from the curb, Senator Packwood reached over and
put his right arm around Ms. Rothrock's shoulders.  He then
touched her left leg just above the knee.  Ms. Rothrock
pushed back against the right side of the car, and continued
to talk about issues and family.  The Senator drove her to
her apartment, where he dropped her off.

    After this incident, Ms. Rothrock did not babysit again
for the Packwoods, and she took care not to place herself in
a position where she would be alone with Senator Packwood.

      2.   Corroborating Witnesses

    The staff has obtained affidavits from two witnesses,
Ms. Rothrock's mother, and her roommate at the time, who
stated that Ms. Rothrock told them that Senator Packwood had
kissed her, or made an advance, while she was babysitting
for the Senator's children.  Ms. Rothrock' 8 mother recalls
that her daughter told her that she had babysat for the
Packwoods, and that he had given her a kiss on the porch;
she was upset by the incident.  Her roommate recalls that
she told her either that evening or the next day that the
Senator had made passes involving inappropriate touching or
kissing, either at his house, or in the car on the way home.
Another witness recalled that in the spring or summer of
1992, but before the allegations became public, Ms. Rothrock
told her that Senator Packwood had grabbed her and made an
advance to her after she babysat for him.  Georgie Packwood
recalled that Ms. Rothrock babysat for them at least once,
but that at the time, they had only one child.  She could
not recall any details, but believed that at the time that
Ms. Rothrock babysat for them, the Senator's eyesight was
still good enough that he would drive their babysitters
home.

      3.   Senator Packwood's Response

    Senator Packwood remembered Ms. Rothrock as a friend of
persons in his office; she was in his office frequently to
visit. He vaguely recalled that she might have applied for a
job in his office.

    Senator Packwood recalled that Ms. Rothrock babysat at
least once for him and his wife, although because she made
reference to babysitting for two children, it would have had
to happen after 1971, when they adopted their second child.
He could not recall if she babysat for them more than once.
With respect to the one instance that he recalled, the
Senator did not remember the event that he and his wife
attended, how Ms. Rothrock got to their house, or when he
and his wife returned home.  He did recall that while his
wife waited in the car to take Ms. Rothrock home, he went
inside the house.  Ms. Rothrock had her shoes off, and she
could not find them.  He helped her look for them; he did
not remember where they found them.  He stated that he then
put his arms around Ms. Rothrock and gave her a kiss, and
she put her arms around his neck and kissed him very
"fulsomely."  He did not recall where in his house that this
took place.  He described the kiss as romantic, although he
could not recall if it was a french kiss; he said that she
responded in kind - she put her arms around him, held her
lips to his, and made no effort to get away. He did not
recall if they had any conversation.  Nor did he recall if
this was the first time he had kissed Ms. Rothrock in this
fashion.  He could not recall that Ms. Rothrock had ever
given him any indication that she would be interested in
this sort of a kiss, or what prompted him to kiss her that
evening, nor did he recall speaking to her afterwards about
the kiss. Senator Packwood saw Ms. Rothrock at a wedding in
1982.  In the mid-1970's, they also arranged to have dinner
together in Seattle or Tacoma as he passed through on his
way to Portland, but they had to cancel.

       4.   Findings

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incident as alleged
by Ms. Rothrock in fact occurred.  Although her recollection
of the number of children she babysat may be inaccurate, her
account is corroborated by three witnesses to whom she
related the incident, two of whom she told shortly after it
occurred.  Senator Packwood testified that he recalled
kissing Ms. Rothrock after she babysat for.him and his wife,
although he portrays Ms. Rothrock as a willing participant;
he also testified that he did not drive her home.  However,
both Ms. Rothrock's mother and her roommate at the time
recall her distress at the incident, and her description of
the advances as unwanted.  Senate Ethics Counsel finds this
corroborating evidence persuasive, and finds that the
incident occurred as described by Ms. Rothrock.

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's
conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that
reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of
conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon
the Senate.

    Q.   Julie Williamson

        1.   Testimony of Julie Williamson

    In late 1967 or early 1968, Julie Williamson worked as
Senator Packwood's Clatsop County campaign chairperson.  In
September, 1968, after her husband was transferred to
Portland, she began working on Senator Packwood's general
election campaign, running a phone bank.  In January, 1969,
she was hired as a member of his Senate staff.  About six or
eight weeks after she started, she was asked to staff a
dinner the Senator was hosting for the Portland press corps
at a local restaurant called Burt Lee's.  Not knowing that
staff spouses were generally not invited to such events, she
invited her husband to attend.  When her husband arrived at
the dinner, Senator Packwood appeared displeased, and seated
him at the far end of the table.  He seated Ms. Williamson
next to him at the head of the table, and two or three times
during dinner he reached over and patted her on the leg.
After dinner, Ms. Williamson, her husband, and Senator
Packwood sat in a booth in the bar and talked.  When Ms.
Williamson's husband got up to go to the bathroom, Senator
Packwood fell over Ms. Williamson, and gave her a big kiss
on the side of the face.  She pushed him off.

    On a Thursday afternoon about 2:00 p.m. later that
spring in 1969, shortly before the annual Dorchester
conference, an annual Oregon Republican event founded by the
Senator, Ms. Williamson was working alone in the office.  As
she talked on the phone in the front office, Senator
Packwood came in, walked around the desk and behind Ms.
Williamson, and kissed her on the back of the neck.  She
finished her call, turned to him, and told him never to do
that again.  She walked into the back office, and Senator
Packwood followed her.  Ms. Williamson became worried, and
tried to get around the Senator to get out of the office; he
tried to grab her, and she moved around the office to try to
get away from him.  Finally, he grabbed her; when she tried
to kick him in the shins, he stood on her feet.  He grabbed
her ponytail with his left hand, pulled her head back
forcefully, and gave her a big wet kiss, with his tongue in
her mouth.  She did not smell or taste any alcohol.  With
his right hand, he reached up under her skirt and grabbed
the edge of her panty girdle and tried to pull it down.  She
struggled, got away from him, and ran into the front office.
He stalked out past her, paused at the threshold to the
hallway, and told her, "If not today, someday," and left.

    Ms. Williamson called a friend, Ann Elias, and asked if
she could come over to her apartment, because something
terrible had just happened.  At the time, Ms. Elias was the
office manager for Senator Packwood's 1968 campaign
committee, and her husband was the campaign manager.  Ms.
Williamson locked up the office and went to Ms. Elias's
apartment; they talked for some time, with Ms. Williamson
telling Ms. Elias what had happened, and Ms. Williamson then
went home.

    The next weekend, Ms. Williamson and her husband
attended the Dorchester conference.  Ms. Williamson spoke to
Senator Packwood only once, as she sat in a bar next to his
wife, Georgie.  He slid up on the bar stool next to Ms.
Williamson, and whispered in her ear, "Don't tell your
husband, and don't quit your job,' and then walked off.

    The following Monday, Ms. Williamson told Roy Sampsel,
Senator Packwood's driver about what had happened.  Mr.
Sampsel told her, in effect, "Don't take it personally, the
Senator's just like that."  She also told Senator Packwood's
administrative assistant about the incident.[fn 101]

    About two weeks later, Ms. Williamson picked the Senator
up at the Multnomah Athletic Club, to drive him to the Civic
Auditorium for an appearance.  When Senator Packwood got in
the car, she angrily confronted him about the incident, and
asked him what it was that he had thought was going to
happen the other day.  She asked, in effect, whether he
thought they were just going to have at it on the office
floor.  He responded, "I suppose you're one of the ones who
want a motel."  Senator Packwood appeared to be angry that
Ms. Williamson had confronted him.  He got out of the car at
the Auditorium, delivered a speech for the Girl Scout cookie
drive, and got back in the car.  She drove him back to the
Multnomah Athletic Club, and he got out, slammed the front
door, retrieved his package of Girl Scout cookies from the
back seat, and left.  That was the last time she spoke with
the Senator.  She quit her job shortly thereafter, although
she did not have another job at the time.  With her typing
and secretarial skills, she was able to get a job fairly
quickly with a Portland law firm, although she had to take a
cut in pay.

     2.   Corroborating Witnesses

    The staff interviewed eight witnesses who recall that
Ms. Williamson told them in the late 1960's or early 1970's
about an incident that had occurred involving Senator
Packwood.  Their recollections of their conversations with
Ms. Williamson vary as to the details they recall; five,
including her husband at the time, recall that Ms.
Williamson told him or her that Senator Packwood had
"attacked" her, or tried to take her clothes off; four of
these witnesses recall that Ms. Williamson was very upset by
the incident.  A sixth witness recalls that Ms. Williamson
told him that she had left Senator Packwood's office because
of an incident involving sexual harassment,[fn 102] and the
other two witnesses recall that Ms. Williamson told them
that Senator Packwood had made a "pass" at her.[fn 103]

    A ninth witness recalls that Ms. Williamson told him in
1992, shortly before the allegations became public, that
Senator Packwood had grabbed her and kissed her, and tried
to pull her girdle off.

    The staff also deposed Ann Elias, the friend to whom Ms.
Williamson spoke immediately after the incident.  Ms. Elias
is a long-time friend of Senator Packwood's.  Shortly before
the Washington Post story was published, Ms. Elias wrote a
statement at Senator Packwood's request, in which she opined
that Ms. Williamson was interested in a "romantic"
relationship with Senator Packwood.  At her deposition, Ms.
Elias testified that Ms. Williamson had come to her
apartment one afternoon in early 1969, and told her that
Senator Packwood had kissed her.  She testified that Ms.
Williamson had not told her anything about Senator Packwood
standing on her toes, pulling at her clothes, or pulling her
ponytail.[fn 104]  She testified that Ms. Williamson was
"titillated" by the incident, although she could not point
to anything to support that opinion.  She testified that Ms.
Williamson discussed with her the possibility of a
relationship with the Senator, and wondered if she should
tell her husband about the incident.

    According to Ms. Elias, Ms. Williamson has been telling
this story on the "cocktail circuit' for years; she
suggested that the story has gotten better with each
telling.[fn 105]

      2.   Senator Packwood's Response

    Senator Packwood recalled that he first met Ms.
Williamson in late 1959 or 1960 when he worked as an
attorney in private practice; Ms. Williamson was a legal
secretary at a different firm in the same building.  She
worked as a volunteer on his campaign in 1962.  During his
1968 campaign, she acted as his Clatsop County campaign
chair.  After her husband was transferred back to Portland,
she worked in his campaign headquarters until the fall of
1968, when he hired her onto his Senate staff.  He did not
recall her position or duties, the size of his staff, or the
size or layout of his office at the time.  He did recall
that part of Ms. Williamson's duties would have been to
answer phones, type, and act as a receptionist, although he
did not recall where she sat in the office.

    Senator Packwood described Ms. Williamson as having
short, close blond hair.  He recalled that she was a very
good county chair, and a good headquarters worker, but he
did not recall what type of employee she was while she was
on his Senate staff.

    Senator Packwood did not recall the dinner at Burt Lee's
that Ms. Williamson referred to, or any other dinner that
she staffed for him, or that she and her husband attended.
He did not recall anything about this incident described by
Ms. Williamson.[fn 106]

    Senator Packwood had no recollection of the incident
described by Ms. Williamson as taking place shortly before
the Dorchester conference in 1969, in which Ms. Williamson
claims that Senator Packwood grabbed her, pulled her
ponytail, kissed her, and tried to take off her girdle.
Senator Packwood stated that Ms. Williamson had very short
hair at the time, and that she did not have a pony tail.  He
provided photographs of Ms. Williamson taken at his campaign
headquarters in the fall of 1968,.before the election.[fn
107]

    Senator Packwood recalled nothing about the incident
described by Ms. Williamson as taking place at the
Dorchester conference.

    Senator Packwood did recall that on a weekend day, Ms.
Williamson had driven him to a Girl Scout function, possibly
the cookie drive kickoff.  He did not recall why she was
driving him that day, but he believed that she was driving
her car.  He recalled that the two of them talked about the
possibility of having an affair, and that Ms. Williamson
asked where they would do that.  He told her they could do
it in the office, and she responded that she could not
possibly do that.  He jokingly responded that he supposed
they could use a motel.  Senator Packwood could not recall
if this was the first time they had discussed the
possibility of having an affair, nor could he recall who
brought up the subject.  He did not recall ever discussing
this subject with Ms. Williamson again.  He could not recall
any physical contact between the two of them before this
conversation.  He did not recall what they were doing at the
time the conversation took place, if anyone else was in the
car at the time, whether the conversation took place as they
drove to the Girl Scout event or afterwards, or where Ms.
Williamson took him after the Girl Scout event.[fn 108]

    Senator Packwood recalled that Ms. Williamson left his
employ in late spring of 1969.  He did not recall why she
quit, or whether she had another job at the time.

    Senator Packwood stated that he had heard from others in
the past, he did not know when or from whom, that Ms.
Williamson had made a passing comment to the effect that he
had made a pass at her.  It was possible that Ann Elias had
told him about the incident sometime before he talked to her
about it in May, 1992.

    Senator Packwood testified that he had called his former
driver, Roy Sampsel, because he had read a story in the
paper wherein Ms. Williamson claimed to have told her
coworkers about the incident in his office.  He stated that
Mr. Sampsel told him that Ms. Williamson used to talk to him
about her terribly unhappy marriage, and specifically that
she wanted to have an affair with Senator Packwood.  She
asked Mr. Sampsel if she should do so.  Several weeks before
the Dorchester conference, she told Mr. Sampsel that Senator
Packwood had hugged her, and asked Mr. Sampsel if she should
go to the conference.  Mr. Sampsel told the Senator that Ms.
Williamson was in a "dither." He told the Senator that he
advised Ms. Williamson against having an affair with the
Senator.

    Mr. Sampsel was contacted by the staff shortly after
Senator Packwood gave this testimony.  He provided a sworn
affidavit stating that in 1969, shortly before the
Dorchester conference, Ms. Williamson told him that Senator
Packwood had hugged her and made a pass at her in the
office.  Mr. Sampsel believed that Ms. Williamson told him
about this the same day it happened, or the next day.  They
talked about this incident more than once.  Mr. Sampsel told
Ms. Williamson that the situation could not be allowed to
get out of hand, because of the political implications for
Senator Packwood.  He did not tell Senator Packwood what Ms.
Williamson had said.  He described Senator Packwood as a
flirter, and stated that he had had general conversations
with him about his tendency to be overly flirtatious.

    Mr. Sampsel stated that Ms. Williamson liked Senator
Packwood a lot.  At the time, she was not getting along with
her husband.  But she never told him that she wanted to have
an affair with Senator Packwood, nor did he ever tell
Senator Packwood that Ms. Williamson wanted to have an
affair with him. Senator Packwood never indicated that he
was interested in having an affair with Ms. Williamson.
Although Ms. Williamson was outgoing, perky, and a flirt
herself, he saw no indication that she was interested in a
sexual relationship with the Senator.

    Mr. Sampsel stated that about three months before he was
contacted by Committee staff, Senator Packwood called him,
and said that he was under a little heat, and needed to see
what Mr. Sampsel knew.  He asked if Mr. Sampsel recalled Ms.
Williamson telling him about the version of the incident
that appeared in the paper.  Mr. Sampsel told the Senator
that he did not recall Ms. Williamson describing the
incident as graphically or in as much detail as the version
that appeared in the newspaper.

    In his appearance before the Committee, Senator Packwood
stated that he did not recall the incident, but that he
denied that it happened as described by Ms. Williamson.  He
based this denial on the fact that several persons claim
that Ms. Williamson told them of the incident at the time,
but she did not tell them about details such as him standing
on her toes, pulling her hair, or attempting to pull down
her undergarments.

        4.   Findings

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incident as alleged
by Ms. Williamson in fact occurred.  Although it occurred
many years ago, Ms. Williamson has a vivid recollection of
the incident. Additionally, several witnesses clearly recall
that Ms. Williamson told them about the incident, including
her distress At the incident  in some detail, shortly after
it happened.

    Senator Packwood has testified that he does not recall
the incident described by Ms. Williamson.  At the same time,
however, he has denied that the incident occurred as she now
describes it. His basis for this denial is his conclusion
that Ms. Williamson has embellished upon the incident,
because several persons have stated that she told them of
the incident at the time, but that she did not provide the
details that she has now given to the Committee.  Leaving
aside the fact that Senator Packwood seems to be conceding
that something happened, the fact that Ms. Williamson did
not share all of the details of the incident with some of
these witnesses does not mean that they did not occur. In
addition, there are several indications in Senator
Packwood's diary, and from testimony from one of Senator
Packwood's closest friends, that one of these witnesses may
have lied about her recollection of conversations with the
staff member about the incident.

    Senator Packwood has also suggested that even if he did
make advances to Ms. Williamson, they were welcomed, because
she wanted to have an affair with him.  He testified that
they talked after the incident about having an affair
(although he could not recall the details of the
conversation), and that she told his driver that she wanted
to have an affair with the Senator. Senator Packwood's
driver has specifically denied that Ms. Williamson ever told
him that she wanted to have an affair with the Senator.
Senator Packwood's recollection of the conversation with Ms.
Williamson after the incident is not inconsistent with Ms.
Williamson's recollection, and is not persuasive evidence
that the incident as alleged by Ms. Williamson was welcomed.

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's
conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that
reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of
conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon
the Senate.

    R.   Additional Findings

    Senator Packwood has testified that until he entered a
treatment program in late 1992, he had significant problems
with alcohol: he drank often and heavily, and he suffered
blackouts. He considers himself to be an alcoholic.  Senator
Packwood has offered this testimony not as an excuse for his
actions, but perhaps as an explanation.

    Counsel notes that several of the incidents occurred in
the morning, and that Senator Packwood testified he did not
drink in the morning.  Several occurred in the afternoon
during office hours.  In only a few instances was there any
indication that Senator Packwood could have been intoxicated
at the time of the incident.  Senate Ethics Counsel finds
that in each of the incidents alleged, regardless of his
state of sobriety at the time of any given incident, Senator
Packwood is responsible for his actions.

     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that these incidents, taken
collectively, reflect a pattern of abuse by Senator Packwood
of his position of power over women who were in a
subordinate position, either as his employees, as Senate
employees, prospective employees, campaign workers, or
persons whose livelihood prevented them from effectively
protesting or seeking redress for his actions.  These women
were not on an equal footing with Senator Packwood, and he
took advantage of that disparity to visit upon them
uninvited and unwelcome sexual advances, some of which
constituted serious assaultive behavior, but all of which
constituted an abuse of his position of power and authority
as a United States Senator.

    Senate Ethics Counsel does not accept the notion that
this type of conduct at one time was not viewed as improper,
and that Senator Packwood is being punished for actions that
were acceptable at the time.  It has never been acceptable
conduct to force unwanted physical attentions on another.
Moreover, Senator Packwood's conduct is exacerbated by the
fact that the incidents occurred with persons who were
effectively powerless to protest in the face of his position
as a United States Senator.

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's
conduct, spanning a period of more than twenty years,
constitutes a pattern of abuse of his position of power and
authority, and is improper conduct reflecting upon the
United States Senate.

    During his appearance before the Committee in June 1995,
Senator Packwood was asked to assess whether his conduct
would reflect upon the Senate, if the alleged conduct
actually happened, in only those cases which he had
testified he did not recall.

"Q: (by Senator Dorgan) ... I guess my question was: If it
happened, is it, in your judgment, behavior that brings
discredit upon the Senate?

A: If it happened--and of course this is always--if it
happened and it became public, it brings discredit on the
Senate.  If it happened and it doesn't become public, does
that not bring discredit on the Senate?  It doesn't make the
incident any better or worse, but is the discredit the
publicity of it?"

    Senate Ethics Counsel rejects any suggestion that such
conduct may not reflect discredit upon the Senate, if it
remains undiscovered or unpublicized.  It is the behavior
which is discrediting, and it is no less so if only its
victims know of

     Senate Ethics Counsel notes that there are no time
limitations on the Senate's authority to discipline Members.
Some of the incidents occurred twenty-five years ago.  But
these incidents cannot be considered in isolation.  Counsel
finds that all of the incidents, taken collectively,
constitute a pattern of abuse by Senator Packwood, and
improper conduct.  Counsel notes that the age of any
particular incident is appropriately considered, not in a
determination of whether the incident was part of a pattern,
but in a determination of the appropriate sanction to be
imposed upon Senator Packwood with respect to the pattern of
improper conduct.

Endnotes

68.  This staff member is designated "C-1" in the Committee
Exhibits.

69.  During an interview, Ms. Fulton stated that she had
asked the staffer not to hang around the office in the
evenings, because if someone was around to drink and talk
with the Senator, he would stay instead of going home.  Ms.
Fulton was worried about his drinking, and felt that the
staffer gave him an excuse to stay at the office and drink.

70.  The recollections of the staffer and her roommate are
slightly different regarding the timing of when she told her
roommate about the incident.  The staffer recalls that she
told her roommate about the incident the next day.  Her
roommate recalls that the staffer came home the evening of
the incident, upset and crying, told her what had happened,
and that she then went to her boyfriend's apartment.
Nevertheless, the staffer's roommate remembers specific
details of the incident as described to her by the staffer.

71.  Senator Packwood testified that Lindy Paull had told
Elaine Franklin that she would not come to any meetings with
the staffer, but he could not recall whether he learned this
while the staffer worked for him, or after she left.

72.  The staffer's fiance, later her husband, worked for
Rep. DeFazio, a Democrat from Oregon.  Entries in Senator
Packwood's diaries indicate that he attempted to capitalize
on this fact by feeding misleading information to the
staffer's husband, in the hopes that he would pass it on to
his boss, and by using the staffer as a "mole" in the
DeFazio camp.  When he was shown these entries, however,
Senator Packwood could not remember if he took advantage of
the staffer's relationship with her boyfriend to pass
misinformation on to Rep. DeFazio.

73.  Senator Packwood stated that he did not know if his
signature was even necessary to activate a pay raise, and it
was possible that people got pay raises without his
knowledge or approval.

74.  Senator Packwood would not say whether he attempted to
accurately record his thoughts and impressions of his
staffers - he said that he was "not going to get into that."
Nor could he vouch for the accuracy or inaccuracy of these
entries at the time he recorded them; he would not say
whether he intended these entries to be accurate.

75.  In a diary entry dated May 12, 1992, in which Senator
Packwood records a conversation with Elaine Franklin about
the possible Vanity Fair article, he records Ms. Franklin's
comment that this was another example of the staffer blowing
things out of proportion; he also records Pam Fulton's
opinion that the staffer was indiscreet, because she told
Ms. Fulton that she felt that she had to stay around and
drink with the Senator.

76.  An April 1, 1992 diary entry records that the staffer
is a liar, after Senator Packwood learned that she had some
complaint about him making sexual advances toward her.
There is also an entry in the Cormack transcript for
February 5, 1993, in which Senator Packwood recorded that
the staffer was a "habitual liar;" however, this entry does
not appear in the original diary tape.  Senator Packwood
testified that he added it in late July or early August
1993.  Another diary entry in Senator Packwood's diary that
indicates that the staffer was a liar appears in July of
1993.

77.  Julia Brim-Edwards, a Packwood staffer, in a statement
she prepared for the Post in the fall of 1992, claimed that
the staffer did not intend to ask anyone else to the Mel
Torme concert, and that a week or so before the concert, she
told the staffer that she thought it was inappropriate that
she had asked the Senator to go to the concert.  She claimed
that the staffer agreed, and tried to round up others to go;
although there was not a lot of interest, she finally was
able to find others to attend.

   Senator Packwood's diary, however, has an entry several
weeks before the concert reflecting that the reporter who
attended the concert had been in his office that day, and
that she was one of the persons who would be attending the
Mel Torme concert.

78.  Although Senator Packwood claimed that he had been
drinking heavily that evening, and that he did not recall
returning to his office with the staffer, his diary contains
an entry noting that he had taken the staff to dinner at the
Irish Times, that he had "pushed a little hard' on the
staffer, wanting her to be "a mole and a spy into the
DeFazio organization because of her relationship with the
guy she goes with," and noting that the staffer talked about
Rep. DeFazio's support from the unions. Senator Packwood
would not say if this entry was accurate, and stated that he
could have totally made up the part of the entry discussing
the conversation about labor unions.  However, this account
of their conversation is consistent with the staffer's
recollection of the evening.

79.  This incident is recounted in Senator Packwood's diary.
He also recounted it during the floor debate on enforcement
of the Committee's document subpoena.  The staffer has
indicated, through her attorney, that this incident never
occurred.

80.  There is an entry in Senator Packwood's diary for April
29, 1992, recording this meeting with the staffer and Ms.
Franklin.

81.  This press release was provided to the Committee by the
staffer's attorney.

82.  According to Senator Packwood, he deleted this entry
from his diary tape, either before he left for recess in
August 1993, or if the tape was still in his machine when he
left for recess, when he got back in September.

83.  Senator Packwood's diary for August 21, 1993, indicates
that in his review of previous diary entries, Senator
Packwood found an entry reflecting that Ms. Heffernan wanted
a job with him, that he had a telephone conversation with
her in 1984, and that she had had lunch with him and Elaine
Franklin to discuss the possibility.

84.  The Committee received information from a woman who
said that she saw Ms. Heffernan throw her arms around the
Senator and kiss him on the mouth at a social function
celebrating a legislative victory in September 1982.

85.  This would have occurred in January 1981.

86.  He recalled that she told him the room contained a
couch and perhaps a mini-bar.

87.  Ms. Dawson also testified that, aside from that
conversation, Ms. Wagers never said or did anything that
suggested to her that she was interested in having an affair
with the Senator.

88.  The press secretary and the administrative assistant
are the same person.

89.  Both this evening, and the events of a following day,
appear to be recounted in Senator Packwood's diary, in
entries for February 11 and February 13, 1980.  They do not
include Senator Packwood walking Ms. Hutton to her car.
Senator Packwood stated that these entries were reasonably
accurate, as far as they concerned Ms. Hutton, but he could
not swear to the accuracy of everything in the entry.

90.  Senator Packwood stated that he had talked to two
staffers who were in the van at the time, and that one of
them, Terry Kay, remembered Ms. Hutton kissing him, while
the other did not.  Mr. Kay confirmed that he had seen Ms.
Hutton kiss the Senator on this occasion.  Senator
Packwood's diary reflects that on the afternoon that Ms.
Hutton was dropped off, she "gave each of us a kiss."

91.  Senator Packwood's attorneys have provided statements
from two men who knew Ms. Hutton in the late 1970's and
early 1980's.  One of these men, John Morrison, who told
Staff Counsel that he himself was interested in Ms. Hutton,
said he had observed in social situations that Ms. Hutton
was "coming on" to the Senator.  The other man, Dr. Pat
Golden, claimed that Ms. Hutton gave him the impression that
she was a good friend of Senator Packwood, that she was
close to him and enjoyed campaigning for him, and that she
was fond of him.

92.  This staff member is designated "C-7" in the
Committee's Exhibits.

93.  The staff member does not recall why she was working in
Senator Packwood's office at the time.  She may have been
going over Committee work with the Senator, or talking about
the recent eruption at Mount St. Helen's.  She stated that
it was not too uncommon for Committee staffers to be working
in Senator Packwood' 6 personal office.

94.  The staff member had the idea that she might be safe
from Senator Packwood if he thought she had a boyfriend.

95.  There appears to be some confusion about the time
period of the incident:  the staff member remembers that it
happened in the early summer of 1980; her friend seems to
recall that it happened during the college Christmas break
in late 1980 or early 1981.  Nevertheless, her friend
clearly recalls the incident.

96.  This person is designated "C-8  in the Committee
Exhibits.

97.  Senator Packwood's calendar for 1977 indicates that he
met with Ms. McMahon at 6:15 on February 17.

98.  This staff member is designated  C-12  in the
Committee's Exhibits.

99.  This staff member is designated 'C-13" in the
Committee's Exhibits.

100.  This staff member is designated "C-15" in the
Committee Exhibits.

101.  In a letter to Senator Packwood dated November 19,
1992, which Senator Packwood forwarded to the Post, the
administrative assistant states that he does not recall the
staff member telling him about the incident; he also
confirmed this in an interview with the staff.  A diary
entry and a memo provided to the Committee by Senator
Packwood indicate that this individual did tell Senator
Packwood that he had heard from others that Senator Packwood
had tried to "screw" the staff member.  Senator Packwood
testified that the individual had used that term not in a
sexual sense, but in the sense that he had made a pass at
her.

102.  This witness's spouse recalls that when asked why she
left Senator Packwood's office, Ms. Williamson made vague
comments indicating that "something" had happened.

103.  One witness did not believe Ms. Williamson when she
told her about the "pass."  The other witness recalled that
Ms. Williamson told her that Senator Packwood had made a
"pass" at her, and had chased her, but she did not recall
the incident as being as serious as Ms. Williamson now
alleges, and she did not think that Ms. Williamson seemed
agitated or upset at the time.

104.  Ms. Elias claimed that Ms. Williamson did not wear her
hair in a ponytail at the time, and that her hair was not
even long enough to tie back.

105.  Although Ms. Elias, Elaine Franklin, and Senator
Packwood himself all testified that Ms. Williamson had been
telling her story on the "cocktail circuit," the staff was
unable to find anyone, other than Ms. Elias, who claimed to
have actually heard Ms. Williamson telling her "story" in
social settings over the years, or who could verify that it
had "grown" with the retelling.  In addition, Senator
Packwood's diary entries indicate that Ms. Elias was
uncomfortable with the statement she prepared for Senator
Packwood, specifically that she was torn between her loyalty
to Senator Packwood and her desire to tell the truth.  The
entries indicate that she was "buoyed up" by Jack Faust, a
friend of Senator Packwood's, who convinced her that Ms.
Williamson had been telling her story on the "cocktail
circuit" over the years, and that it had grown as it was
retold.

106.  Senator Packwood's diary indicates that on February 10
1969, he hosted a dinner at Burt Lee's for the media.

107.  These pictures show Ms. Williamson from the front,
with short, wispy hair.  One witness has stated that at the
time of the incident in the spring of 1969, or shortly
thereafter, Ms. Williamson did indeed wear her hair in a
ponytail.  She describes her as having fine hair that she
was trying to grow long, which she pulled back in a short
ponytail.  Another witness stated that as of late 1968 and
early 1969, Ms. Williamson had short stringy hair that she
pulled back from her face with bobbypins; as it grew longer,
she pulled it back in a ponytail.

108.  Senator Packwood's diaries have an entry dated
Saturday, April 5, 1969, which reflects that he attended a
Girl Scout event.  It does not reflect that Ms. Williamson
drove him, or any conversation about an affair.





V.   EVIDENCE REGARDING THE ALLEGATIONS OF ALTERING EVIDENCE

    A.   Summary and Overview of the Evidence

    Senator Packwood's diaries comprise over 8,000 pages of
single-spaced entries for virtually every day since 1969,
including weekends and vacations.  They set out minute
details of his life since 1969, from security briefings by
the White House, to meetings with constituents, lobbyists
and other senators, to detailed descriptions of meals and
social occasions.

     Senator Packwood dictated his diaries, first on
dictation belts, and later on audiotapes, which were
transcribed by Cathy Cormack, who was his personal secretary
from 1969 to 1981, when she went to work for the Republican
Senatorial Campaign Committee.  While Ms. Cormack worked for
the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, she continued
to type the diaries, and received a modest reimbursement
from Senate funds.  When she left the Committee in 1983, she
continued to type Senator Packwood's diaries, for which
services she was paid by Senator Packwood's campaign
committee.

     NOTE: (For a detailed explanation of events leading up
to the Committee's review of the Senator's diaries, see
discussion in the Procedural Background section.)

 1.   Results of Comparison of Tape to Transcript

    In view of Ms. Cormack's testimony in December, 1993
about changes made by Senator Packwood to tapes which she
was transcribing, it was necessary to compare the
transcripts which she typed from tapes altered by Senator
Packwood with transcripts prepared from the original
unchanged tapes to determine if there were any differences.
The staff compared the transcripts prepared from the
original unchanged audiotapes to the "Cormack" transcripts
for 1989 through 1993, in order to determine if there were
entries on the audiotape that had been left out of the
Cormack transcripts, if there were entries on the audiotape
that had been changed in the Cormack transcripts, or if
there were passages on the Cormack transcripts that
that[sic] were not on the audiotape.

    As the staff compared the transcript prepared from the
original unchanged audiotapes to the Cormack transcripts for
1992 and 1993, it discovered numerous differences between
them.  These differences fell into three broad
categories:[fn 109]

    a.   Large portions of the audiotape that were
completely missing from the Cormack transcripts;

    b.   Numerous instances, especially in the last half of
1993, where entries from the audiotape appeared on the
Cormack transcripts, but were heavily reworded;

    c.   Many instances where entries related to the
Committee's inquiry or arguably incriminating or
embarrassing entries on the audiotapes were missing from the
Cormack transcripts, and different entries were substituted
in their place.

    The staff found no differences, other than minor
differences that could be laid to transcriber error, between
the audiotapes for 1989, 1990, and 1991, and the
corresponding Cormack transcripts.

2.   The Focus on Certain Changed Entries

    Differences in these first two categories could arguably
be attributed to the transcriber, particularly since Ms.
Cormack had testified that she had been under intense time
pressure to transcribe the audiotapes for 1992 and 1993, and
that she had condensed many entries.  Senate Ethics Counsel
focused on the third category, and isolated entries related
to the Committee's inquiry or where potentially
incriminating or embarrassing portions of the audiotapes
were missing from the Cormack transcripts, and neutral or
arguably exculpatory entries were substituted in the Cormack
transcripts.

The entries in this third category fall into several groups:

    a.   Entries dealing with the Committee's inquiry into
alleged sexual misconduct and witness intimidation;

    b.   Entries indicating Senator Packwood's knowledge of,
and possible involvement with, independent expenditures made
on his behalf during his 1992 campaign;

    c.   Entries discussing Senator Packwood's possible use
of office staff or facilities for campaign purposes;

    d.   Entries dealing with the Oregon Citizens Alliance
(OCA), which had accused Senator Packwood of making a "deal"
during the 1992 senatorial campaign, that the OCA would not
run a candidate against him in return for promises by him;

    e.   Entries referring to contributions to Senator
Packwood's legal defense fund.

    Once these entries were isolated, the staff questioned
both Cathy Cormack and Senator Packwood to determine who was
responsible for making the changes.

     3.   Brief Summary of Senator Packwood's Response

      For the most part, Senator Packwood took
responsibility for the deletions from the audiotape where
there were corresponding substitutions in the Cormack
transcripts.  He testified that he began making changes to
his untranscribed diary tapes in January 1993, and through
the spring of 1993, after his attorneys requested that he
provide them with excerpts from his 1992 diaries that might
deal with the issue of witness intimidation.[fn 110]  He
stated that he was fearful that his diaries would be leaked
to the press from his attorneys' offices, and he knew that
there were entries in the diaries that he did not want to
appear in public.  As the Senator listened to the audiotapes
to find the portions relating to possible witness
intimidation to provide to his lawyers, he believes that he
made notes about the location of passages he might later
want to delete.  After a January 1993 trip to Oregon and the
intense media attention that was focused on him. his fear of
leaks intensified.

    Through the spring of 1993, while he reviewed his diary
tapes for 1992 looking for the excerpts requested by his
attorneys, and for other entries that might be helpful to
his attorneys, Senator Packwood also deleted certain
potentially embarrassing passages from the audiotapes, and
in many cases, substituted different passages, more from a
compulsion to fill up the space on the tape than anything
else.

    Senator Packwood was not concerned about leaks from his
1993 diary audiotapes at this time, as his attorneys had not
requested them.  Thus, during the spring of 1993, as he
reviewed his diaries for previous years (including his 1992
audiotapes) for information that would he helpful to his
attorneys, and at the same time made changes to his 1992
audiotapes to delete embarrassing references, Senator
Packwood continued to dictate contemporaneous entries with
no effort to monitor his dictation to exclude embarrassing
or damaging entries.

      Sometime later that summer, in late July or early
August, 1993, Senator Packwood's attorneys asked that he get
the rest of his audiotapes transcribed.[fn 111] Fearing that
the 1993 diaries would now be leaked to the press through
his attorneys' offices, Senator Packwood went through these
tapes and again deleted entries that might prove
embarrassing to himself or others if they got to the press.
In many cases, he also substituted different entries on the
tape, again, more out of a compulsion to fill the space on
the tape than for any other reason.[fn 112]

      After dropping off all of the outstanding audiotapes
to his transcriber, Cathy Cormack, in early August 1993,
Senator Packwood took all of his previously transcribed
diaries, from 1991 going back to 1969, home with him during
the August 1993 recess, where he reviewed them for
information that might be helpful to his attorneys. However,
despite the fact that he was fearful that the press would
obtain all of his diaries, he made no changes to any of
these transcripts to delete entries that would prove
embarrassing to himself or others if obtained by the press.
Senator Packwood testified that he felt no need to excise
embarrassing entries from his 1969 - 1991 diaries, because
he was selecting pages from these years to give to his
attorneys.

      After he returned from the recess, Senator Packwood
asked Ms. Cormack to give him the audiotapes back, as he had
neglected to make a copy for himself of the changed 1993
audiotapes that he had given to her before the recess.[fn
113] Ms. Cormack recalled that Senator Packwood told her he
wanted the audiotapes back because of the possibility that
there might be a subpoena; Senator Packwood did not recall
that conversation, although he thought it was possible he
might have mentioned the word "subpoena" to her in a
different conversation. Both now recall that event taking
place sometime in September 1993.  Senator Packwood returned
the tapes to Ms. Cormack within about a week.

      Again, during this time when he was changing prior
tapes to remove embarrassing entries, Senator Packwood
continued to dictate contemporaneous entries with no effort
to monitor the content of those entries. He made changes to
one of those tapes, covering August and possibly part of
September 1993, as soon as he was finished dictating it, and
before he gave it to Ms. Cormack to type.

      Senator Packwood delivered all of his diaries that had
been transcribed to date to his attorneys on October 7,
1993, shortly after his first deposition was interrupted so
that the Committee could review the diaries.[fn 114]  Ms.
Cormack continued to work on the untranscribed audiotapes
for 1992 and 1993, and Senator Packwood provided his
attorneys with transcripts as they were finished.[fn 115]
Because she was in a rush to complete the diaries, Ms.
Cormack skipped over, with Senator Packwood's approval,
passages that she deemed to be unimportant, dealing with
things such as squash games with fellow Senators, food,
stereo equipment, music, and movies.

    Senator Packwood made some changes to his diary tape
covering August 1993.  He testified that he made no changes
to September entries, but he did change some October entries
after Ms. Cormack had typed them, marking up the pages and
giving Ms. Cormack instructions on what changes he wanted
made.  Although some of these changes were made after his
deposition was interrupted, he testified that he felt free
to edit entries which were made after the deposition was
interrupted.  With respect to any entries he changed after
he received the Committee's subpoena, he testified that he
did not feel that the subpoena prevented him from editing
his diaries as they were typed and he saw them for the first
time.  Senator Packwood also testified that it was possible
he may have made changes to transcript pages for dates prior
to his deposition, after his deposition was interrupted and
after he received the Committee's subpoena. Senator Packwood
also testified that as Ms. Cormack completed the
transcription of tapes after his October 1993 deposition was
interrupted, and after he received the Committee's subpoena,
he continued to destroy the corresponding tapes.[fn 116]

    Senator Packwood's attorneys were not aware that he kept
original, backup tapes for his diaries.[fn 117]  They
learned of the existence of these tapes on the evening of
November 21, 1993, and the tapes were delivered to them by
Senator Packwood on November 22.  That same day, Arnold &
Porter terminated their representation of Senator Packwood.

    B.   Testimony and Evidence

       1.   Testimony by Cathy Cormack

    Ms. Cormack's deposition was taken a total of three
times. It was taken in November 1993 to determine how she
was paid for her transcription of the diaries.  After she
provided an affidavit to the Committee on December 10, 1993
(after having reviewed her deposition), indicating that some
of the tapes she typed had been changed, her deposition was
taken again in December 1993.  Once the staff had had the
chance to compare the transcripts she typed for Senator
Packwood with the original unchanged tapes, her deposition
was taken again in December 1994.

     a.   Historical Transcription of the Diaries

    Ms. Cormack testified that she had transcribed the
diaries while she was a member of Senator Packwood's
personal Senate office staff, from 1969 to 1981.  She was
not paid any additional compensation, over and above her
Senate salary, for transcribing the diaries.  She then moved
to the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, where she
was paid a small sum from the Senate Disbursing Office to
transcribe Senator Packwood's diaries.  Shortly after she
left the Campaign Committee, she began to be paid to
transcribe the diaries from Senator Packwood's campaign
fund.  She has never been paid for transcribing the diaries
from the personal funds of Senator Packwood.  Senator
Packwood also provided her with an IBM Selectric typewriter,
which she used to type the diaries, and dictation equipment.

    Ms. Cormack testified that over the last 23 years or so,
Senator Packwood has dictated his diaries on audiotapes,
which he periodically provided to her, either delivering
them to her, or having her pick them up from his office.
For a short time, she lived with her husband in California
and later Japan, and received tapes from Senator Packwood by
mail.  Once she returned the typed transcripts to Senator
Packwood, she would erase the audiotape, and either return
it to Senator Packwood, or throw it away.  A single tape,
both sides, covered, on the average, about three weeks to
one month of entries, and took about eight to ten hours to
type.  Ms. Cormack usually received six to eight tapes at a
time from Senator Packwood and typically was about a year or
so behind in her transcription.  Except for the time period
when she lived in California and Japan, when she knew that
she received copies of the tapes, Ms. Cormack assumed that
she was working from the original diary tapes.  As she
completed typing a tape, she would erase it and throw it
away.  Sometime after her first deposition in December 1993,
she had occasion to see Senator Packwood, and he commented
to her that he had the original diary tapes, and she had
received copies to transcribe.

     b.   Early 1993 Request to Transcribe Excerpts

    Ms. Cormack testified that in January 1993, Senator
Packwood asked her to transcribe diary entries surrounding
the 1992 general election out of sequence, as he had been
asked for these entries by his attorneys.  At that point,
she was about a year and half behind in her transcription,
and although she may have been working on the backlog for
earlier in 1992, she had not yet reached the time period
surrounding the 1992 election.  She had some tapes from
early 1992 in her possession, but she did not know
specifically which ones; in any event, she did not have the
tape or tapes that covered the general election in the fall.
She believed that at this time, she had a backlog of 1991
and 1992 tapes going up to, but not including, the period
around the general election of 1992.  Senator Packwood
provided her with the tape or tapes for this time period,
along with a separate tape that contained instructions on
which entries she should type. She typed the entries as
instructed within a few days, and provided them to Senator
Packwood.  Because these entries were being typed out of
sequence, she did not number the pages[fn 118] Because she
knew she would have to come back eventually and type the
entire tape, she did not erase it, but she did not recall if
she kept the tape or gave it back to Senator Packwood.  Ms.
Cormack then resumed her normal transcription of the
diaries.

         c.   August 1993 Delivery of Tapes

    Ms. Cormack may have done a small amount of transcribing
between January 1993, when she finished the 1992 election
entries out of sequence, and August of 1993, for tapes for
late 1991 and early 1992.  In August 1993, about the time of
the August recess, she received six to eight tapes for
transcription from Senator Packwood, covering the first half
of 1993, up to the August recess.  She also had a backlog of
tapes going back to the first part of 1992, which she had
not yet transcribed.  Altogether, including the tapes that
Senator Packwood brought to her in August, she had about 20
tapes to be transcribed.

       d.   Request to Bring Transcription Up To Date

    Ms. Cormack did not begin working on the backlog right
away, as she left for vacation in August.  She did some work
on the tapes when she returned from vacation.  Sometime in
early September, around Labor Day, or possibly later in
September or October, Senator Packwood asked her to get
caught up to date in typing the transcripts.  Ms. Cormack
described this as the "crunch time," when she was working
hard to get the diaries up to date.

    In the past, Ms. Cormack had typed the transcripts
virtually verbatim, correcting a name if she knew it was
incorrect, cleaning up grammar, leaving out repetitions, but
never intentionally deleting, paraphrasing, or adding
material as she typed.  In contrast, during this "crunch
time," Ms. Cormack asked Senator Packwood if she could "boil
down" passages having to do with things such as stereo
equipment, squash games, and meals; Senator Packwood
assented.  However, she never added information to the
transcript that was not on the tape (with one exception
relating to Senator Packwood's purchase of a condominium
where she acted as his real estate agent).

    During this time period, that is, early September 1993,
Senator Packwood telephoned her and asked her to type three
or four months in 1992 out of sequence.  She did so, and got
the transcripts to him right away, as she assumed that he
was meeting with his attorneys.  She then returned to typing
the backlog of tapes.

    e.   Senator Packwood Asks For The Return of the Tapes

    Sometime in early September, but before mid-October,
Senator Packwood called her, and asked her to give all of
the tapes back.[fn 119] He said something to her about "the
possibility of a subpoena," and that "he didn't want me to
have anything in my possession if that were to occur."  She
believed that he was trying to protect her.  Within the
week, however, Senator Packwood returned the tapes to her
for transcription, bringing them back in two batches.

      f.   Discovery of Changes to Tapes

     Because Senator Packwood had requested that she bring
the transcription up to date, Ms. Cormack spent the next
several weeks working feverishly to transcribe all of the
tapes.  In transcribing those tapes, Ms. Cormack sensed that
there may have been some alterations:  there were
differences in the sound on the tape, differences in
background noises, differences in volume, breaks in the
dialogue.  She could not recall how many tapes sounded
"irregular," but she recalled that it was more than one.  At
one point, Ms. Cormack asked Senator Packwood if he was
making changes in the tapes, and he confirmed that he was,
either verbally or by his body language.

    In addition, Ms. Cormack testified that during mid to
late October, when +he was really "crunching" to catch up on
the backlog of tapes, Senator Packwood occasionally asked
her to make changes in the text of diary entries she had
recently typed. More specifically, Ms. Cormack testified as
follows:

"Q:   You mentioned that he would ask you to make changes in
text.  Were these changes made after you had typed the
transcript?

A:   In some cases.

Q:   Tell us how that happened.

A:   Some times he would mark up a piece of paper and I
would redo it.  And on a few occasions, he would dictate, on
a separate tape, a few changes, and give me the pages.

Q:   What time period did this occur in, that he was asking
you to make--

A:   All within the same--I'm sorry, go ahead.

Q:   What time period did that occur in where Senator
Packwood was asking you to make changes in the text?

A:   This would be mostly, as best I can recall, within the
fifteen--mid-to-late October period, when I was crunching to
get this done.

Q:   Of 1993?

A:   Yes."

    Ms. Cormack does not recall Senator Packwood asking her
to do this often, but it happened more than once.  She
recalled that the changes mostly covered the backlogged
months, that is, a good part of 1992 and 1993.  Ms. Cormack
testified that historically, there were less than five
occasions when Senator Packwood had asked her to make
changes on diary pages that had already been typed.

    Ms. Cormack did not recall the precise dates that were
affected by Senator Packwood's alterations, but she did know
that the general time period would have included a large
portion of 1992, and a large portion of 1993, as those were
the tapes that she had backlogged at the time.  She could
not remember if any of the changes to the typed pages were
for years earlier than 1992.

     g.   Completion of the Tapes

      Ms. Cormack finished transcribing a good portion of
the backlogged tapes by mid to late October 1993.  Once
every other day during this September - October 1993 time
period, or as she completed a fair amount of transcript, Ms.
Cormack would deliver it to Senator Packwood.  In addition
to her backlog of tapes, and the six or eight tapes that
Senator Packwood gave her around the time of the August
recess, she also received one or two tapes during the
"crunch time" covering August, September, October, and early
November 1993, which she completed transcribing in early
November.[fn 120] Ms. Cormack recalled that all told, she
completed the backlog in a time frame of about six weeks.

      h.   Comparison of Tape to Transcript   

      For those entries where material had been added to the
Cormack transcript that did not appear on the audiotape, Ms.
Cormack was asked to compare the transcript that the
Committee had prepared from the audiotape to the
corresponding Cormack transcript.  In general, she testified
that although in a few of these instances, she may have
skipped over some of the material that was on the tape, in
no instance did she add any of the information that was on
the Cormack transcript, but not on the corresponding
audiotape (with the one exception about the Senator's
condominium that was mentioned earlier).

      2.   Testimony by Senator Packwood

          a.   Mechanics of Diary Keeping

     Senator Packwood testified that he began keeping his
diaries in 1969, first dictating entries on dictabelts or
disks, and later switching to audiotapes.  Cathy Cormack,
who had been his legislative and legal secretary in Oregon,
and his secretary in the Senate, and was his longstanding
friend and confidant, transcribed his diaries for him from
the beginning, up until the fall of 1993.[fn 121]  This task
was not part of her official duties, and she was not paid
anything over her Senate salary for typing his diaries while
she was on his Senate staff.  When she left his staff and
went-to work for the National Republican Senatorial
Committee, she continued to transcribe the diaries, and she
remained on the Senate payroll, not for transcribing the
diaries, but because she still did some official Senate work
for Senator Packwood.[fn 122]  After Ms. Cormack left the
Campaign Committee, she continued to transcribe the diaries,
and she was paid from Senator Packwood's campaign funds.  No
one but Ms. Cormack transcribed the diaries, and she is the
only person, other than the Senator, who ever saw the
diaries up until the Committee's inquiry.

    Senator Packwood testified that he used tapes that were
sixty minutes on each side, and on average, one tape would
hold about a half month's worth of diary entries.  He
typically made a duplicate of the tape for Ms. Cormack,
which she erased when she was finished typing.[fn 123]  Ms.
Cormack was traditionally about a year and a half behind in
her transcription.  Periodically, either she picked up tapes
from him, or he dropped them off to her.  Ms. Cormack would
not necessarily run out of tapes, but if she were down to,
say, her last two tapes, she would ask him for more tapes.
Upon receiving the typed transcripts from Ms. Cormack,
Senator Packwood organized them in binders, and kept them in
his safe.  He and Cathy Cormack are the only persons who
have the combination to this safe.  He seldom reviewed the
typed transcripts or made changes to them; occasionally,
maybe ten or twenty times over the course of over twenty
years, he edited them.[fn 124]

       b.   Accuracy and Reliability of the Diaries

    Senator Packwood was questioned at length at his January
1995 deposition about the accuracy and reliability of the
entries in his diaries.  Senator Packwood stated that he did
not always dictate his diaries daily, and he often went two
or three days before dictating entries.  He stated that he
usually dictated entries the next morning, but very seldom
on the same day, using his daily calendar of events as a
reference guide.[fn 125]

"Q:  And from that schedule, and your memory, you would
dictate the diary entries?

A:  Yeah, memory, I suppose real or imagined."

     Senator Packwood stated that one purpose of keeping the
diary was as therapy - that while some people talked to
psychologists, he talked to his diary.  He described it as a
potpourri of everything, with perhaps no single purpose.  He
stated that there was no overwhelming reason he kept his
diary, and that perhaps it was just the result of
compulsion.

    Senator Packwood stated that it was sometimes his intent
to create an accurate record of events, and sometimes he
simply gave voice to thoughts that he would put in narrative
form, even though a conversation may not have happened in
that fashion. During his 1995 deposition, Senator Packwood
stated that he would attribute statements to someone if he
thought that was what the person felt, even if that person
had not said it at the time.  He might record a detailed
conversation that never took place.

"Q:   Was it your intention to create an accurate record of
events?

A:   Well, sometimes yes.  Sometimes I say I would give
voice to conversations or thoughts and I would put them in
narrative form, even though they may not have happened in
that fashion.

Q:   Let me ask the question this way:  Was it your intent
in recording diary material to create a nonfictional
account?

A:   No, not necessarily.  I don't mean to say I was writing
a novel with it, and I don't mean to say I was lying to it,
but to the extent -- have you ever seen this situation?  In
fact, I've seen memos to this effect.  You have a meeting
with somebody, some lobbyist comes in.  And then the memo
later -- you get a memo later that's given to you of the
lobbyist's report of the meeting.  And it doesn't comport
with what you remember at all.  And you may say to your
staff, God, did I say that?  And they'll say well, no, or
maybe, Senator, unfortunately you did, and the lobbyist
thought totally different than you remembered it.  So I may
put things in there that others would totally remember as
different.

Q:   But the point that I'm trying to get to is you would,
would you not, attempt to honestly record what you saw and
heard and your impressions of what took place at a meeting?
You weren't trying to record something that didn't happen,
were you?

As   No -- I don't mean no as the answer.  As I said, I
would put things into narrative form, conversations, between
Jones and Smith or Packwood and Green that I would picture I
would have thought or they might have thought that might not
have been said."

    Senator Packwood was asked about his intent in making
entries in his diary:

"Q:   But it was your intent, was it not, to capture the
essence of what happened and to express that accurately?

A:   Again, I don't think I can answer the question any
better than I have.

Q:   I'm not sure that the question has been answered here
quite yet.  And that is a very simple question.  Were you,
in dictating the diary entries, making an effort, or was it
your intent to record events or your impression of events
accurately, truthfully and honestly?

A:   Well, again, I'll try to answer it once more.  I could
put into it conversations, because I dictate in a
conversational narrative form that may not have taken place.

Q:   But were you trying accurately and truthfully to
capture the substance of what took place?

A:   I'm saying the conversation may not have taken place.

Q:   But as you dictated the conversation, which didn't take
place, were you -- was it your intent to have that
conversation reflect the substance of what happened?

[Witness conferred with counsel.]

MR. MUSE:  Ask that question again, because you combine a
whole lot with those questions.

Q:   Was it your intention in dictating entries to the diary
and relating an event or a meeting to capture and express
accurately the substance of what took place at that meeting
or event?

A:   Well, it would depend on my mood, the day, the
thoughts, the pressure.  But I'll say once more, I might
relate a conversation that did not take place on a subject
that did not take place."

     Although he indicated that his diary was generally an
accurate record of time and place and events, Senator
Packwood reiterated numerous times that the substance of the
entries in his diaries may not be accurate, and that
conversations reflected therein may or may not have
occurred, or if they did, they may or may not have been
recounted accurately.  Nor could he provide the Committee
with any way to determine which entries were accurate and
which were not.

    Senator Packwood was referred to an entry from his diary
for July 21, 1989, which reads as follows:

"Had an interview with somebody doing a book on Tom McCall.
I did both of these at [name omitted]'s request.  This guy
is well documented in his facts and the one embarrassing
thing he had was that allegation that I met with Tom at his
beach place in 1972 to try to talk Tom into running against
[name omitted].  I don't know what my diary may show on
this.  I don't recall. I denied that the conversation had
ever taken place and now in my life I don't recall if it
took place or not.  My diary would be a better testimony to
that, dictated at the time."

Senator Packwood was questioned as follows:

"Q:   You appeared to recognize as early as 1989 that your
diary was a reliable reference or resource document, did you
not, Senator?

A:   Mr. Baird, sometimes it's accurate.  Sometimes it's
inaccurate.  Sometimes it's fact.  Sometimes it's fiction.
It is not a reliable document.  I didn't prepare it for
anybody to rely upon it.  I never reviewed it.  I never
edited it.  I never saw it again.  It is no - I didn't draft
it.  It's not like doing a letter or a memo.  It cannot be
regarded as accurate.

Q:   How does one tell which parts of it are accurate and
which parts are not?

A:   I have no idea how you tell.  I have no idea how a
historian tells.  As a matter of fact, I think this
particular meeting with Tom McCall is recounted in his book,
too.  Whether he sees it the same way I saw it or not, I
don't know.

Q:   Why would you have thought it was a reliable source to
look to here to find out whether or not you had had a
conversation?

A:   I've already indicated that if somebody else has a
different view of something that appears in here, I'd be
inclined to defer to how they heard it rather than I heard
it.  Am I going to say this diary is always accurate?  It
clearly is not always accurate.  Am I going to say it's
always inaccurate?  It is clearly not always inaccurate.  It
clearly was not always inaccurate.  If I were to look up
something and find it would I say boy, that's it, that must
be exactly it, no.  Nor could anybody say that about
anything they put in a diary that they've never seen before,
never cleaned up, never edited.

Q:   But you think it is better evidence of whether or not
something happened than your current recollection, do you
not?

A:   I'm not even going to say that.

Q:   Isn't that what you said in July 1989?

A:   Mr. Baird, I am not going to say that this diary is
exactly accurate or can be an accurate recollection.  We can
read Tom McCall's book as to what he said about it.

Q:   You wouldn't say today what you said in 1989, that it
might be a better testimony as to what happened than your
current memory?

A:   All I'm going to say is that - this statement was never
intended to be relied upon by anybody for anything, and I'm
not going to say - I'm not going to have you say and attempt
to put in this record that everything in this diary is
accurate.

Q:   That's not what I'm attempting to say.  I'm asking you
the question:  Would you say today what you said at the time
of this diary entry, and that is that the diary is better
testimony than your present recollection?

A:   Not necessarily."


     Finally, Senator Packwood testified in January 1995
that it was not necessarily his intent to create a
nonfictional account, but he was not lying to his diary.  He
stated that he may have put things in that others would
recall as totally different.

    In contrast, Senator Packwood testified at his earlier
deposition in October 1993 that he would frequently refer
back to his diary as a "resource document,  that he would
use it as a "memory tool," that he had a "strong sense of
history," and that he might use it to write a book.  When he
was asked about this earlier testimony at his deposition in
January 1995, Senator Packwood testified that he did not
find his diary nearly as accurate a reference tool as staff
memos.  He stated that in the past, he would look back at it
from time to time, but that he finally quit, because it did
not give him the answer to his questions.  He stated that
the diaries were not a reliable reference tool, and to call
them a resource tool, as he had in his previous deposition,
would be overstated.  He stated that information was missing
from the diary, and that there were inaccurate entries,
including just about any conversation that was recounted.
Senator Packwood stated that on occasion, he would put
things in his diary that just did not happen.

    Senator Packwood confirmed that he has left his diaries
in trust to the Oregon Historical Society, although he could
not recall the purpose of the trust.  He stated that the
diary has some historical value, although the Historical
Society will not be able to determine which parts of it have
value, and which do not.

    Senator Packwood appeared to have used his diaries to
refresh his recollection about matters to which he testified
during his deposition.[fn 126] For example, his testimony at
his first deposition in 1993 about the incident with Ms.
Hutton in 1980, and about a subsequent occasion when Ms.
Hutton joined the road crew in Oregon for pizza and
charades, both of which occurred in 1980, very closely
tracks diary entries for these occasions.[fn 127] Senator
Packwood also testified at his first deposition in 1993
about a conversation with Ms. Williamson in 1969 when she
drove him to a Girl Scout function; the Girl Scout function
itself is reflected in his diary.[fn 128]  Senator Packwood
testified at his first (1993) and second (1995) depositions
about the details of the evening of the alleged incident
with Complainant 1 in 1990, in which Complainant 1 claims
that Senator Packwood kissed her when they returned to his
office after an informal staff party at the Irish Times.
Senator Packwood stated that he "pieced together" the
details of that evening by talking to others who were
present at the Irish Times, as he had had too much to drink
to remember anything about the evening.  Yet the diary entry
for this evening sets out in some detail the events that
took place at the Irish Times and the substance of his
conversations with Complainant 1, details that would be
known only to Complainant 1 and Senator Packwood. Senator
Packwood would not say how he obtained the information that
appeared in that entry, whether it was accurate, or whether
he intended it to be accurate at the time he recorded it.

      In his earlier 1993 deposition, Senator Packwood
recounted an evening in October 1991 when Complainant 1 was
in his office, and the two of them were drinking wine. He
described how he got up from his desk, and Complainant 1
gave him a big hug, a kiss on the lips, and told him "You
are wonderful," to which he responded "warts and all." This
incident, and the conversation, are recounted in his diary
word for word as he testified before the Committee at his
1993 deposition. When asked at his second (1995) deposition
if this entry was an accurate recounting of what happened
that evening, Senator Packwood testified that he could not
say if it was accurate, and that he could not guarantee if
the conversation occurred as set out in the diary. When it
was pointed out to him that his testimony at his previous
deposition matched exactly the conversation as set out in
the diary entry, he stated that he could not guarantee that
his previous testimony before the Committee was accurate.[fn
129] Finally, he stated that his testimony during his
earlier deposition was accurate, and conceded that the diary
entry itself was also accurate.

      As a general matter, Senator Packwood emphasized that
the diaries are different in kind from things such as memos
and letters, which may go through many revisions to achieve
accuracy. His diaries, in contrast, were dictated, sometimes
"on the fly," and transcribed and thereafter almost never
reviewed, and were not intended to be relied upon for any
specific purpose.

        c. Alteration of Diary Tapes

          1) Review of Diaries in Late 1992, Early 1993

      Senator Packwood testified that in December 1992 or
early January 1993, his attorneys asked him to review his
diaries for relevant passages having to do with the issue of
intimidation of witnesses. He testified that as of early
January 1993, he had all of the 1992 diary tapes in his
possession, as Ms. Cormack had not caught up to that point
in her transcription.[fn 130] Senator Packwood listened to
tapes covering from March to early June, and after Labor Day
in 1992, and identified a period from October 20 to November
10 for Ms. Cormack to transcribe out of sequence. He
recalled that he directed Ms. Cormack to type certain
entries from this time period, although he did not recall
exactly how he did so - that is, whether his instructions to
her were written or on a separate tape, or were incorporated
on the tape itself.

          2)   Fear of Leaks to the Press

      At the same time, as he listened in December 1992 to
the audiotapes of the 1992 diary entries, Senator Packwood
found entries that he did not want to get out of his hands.
He started to become apprehensive at the prospect of turning
any portions of his diaries over to his attorneys.  While it
was no secret that he kept diaries, and indeed news accounts
had previously referred to his diaries, no one but he and
Ms. Cormack had ever actually seen them.  He feared that
once they went to his attorneys and were out of his hands,
they would almost certainly be leaked to the press.  This
fear was heightened when he returned to Oregon in January
1993, and he was met with protesters everywhere he went, at
times fearing for his personal safety or the safety of his
supporters.  He believed that if the press obtained even a
few paragraphs of his diary, they would be embarrassing and
harmful both to himself and to others who were mentioned in
the diaries.  Thus, in early 1993 as he searched for entries
in 1992 to provide to his attorneys, he started making
changes to the untranscribed tapes for 1992.

         3)   Changes Made to the 1992 Tapes

    Senator Packwood testified that starting in January
1993, he began to change his untranscribed 1992 tapes, to
delete entries that could potentially be embarrassing if
obtained by the press. These entries included references to
the Oregon Citizens Alliance (OCA), conversations with
Committee Members about the Committee inquiry that he
thought would suggest a "Republican conspiracy" to the
press,[fn 131] comments about his chief of staff, comments
about women whose names had not been reported by the press
in connection with the allegations of sexual misconduct, and
anything that might have caused personal harm or adverse
publicity to others.  He also changed embarrassing
references to others, including some very descriptive sexual
references. According to Senator Packwood, he changed
anything that could get to the press and embarrass his
friends or other persons.  He testified that this was a
"catch as catch can" effort and he did not get
everything.[fn 132]

    At his January 1995 deposition, Senator Packwood was
asked about approximately forty (40) altered diary entries,
most of which involved the deletion of information from the
original tape and the substitution of new information.

    Senator Packwood testified that he sometimes simply
deleted entries, and sometimes deleted entries and
substituted entries in their place.  He stated that he had
no particular reason for sometimes substituting entries in
the place of entries he deleted other than his compulsion to
fill up the space.  These substitutions might be on the same
subject matter as the deleted material, or they might be
totally different.  When shown one such entry where material
was substituted, the Senator testified as follows 2

"Q:   Why, Senator, did you feel that all these spaces on
the tape that you were creating by eliminating passages had
to be filled?

A:   I can't answer that.

MR. MUSE:  You said "all."  It wasn't all.

A:   There's great gaps that are missing.

Q:   Why did you feel that some of them had to De filled?

A:   I don't know.  Maybe it's just compulsive dictation.  I
have no answer to that."


    Senator Packwood testified that his sole motivation in
making these changes was to prevent the leak of potentially
embarrassing or politically damaging information to the
press by way of his attorneys' office.[fn 133]

    Senator Packwood first stated that he finished making
the changes to the 1992 tapes by the end of February
1993.[fn 134] Although he stated that he could have changed
his 1993 tapes during this same time, he testified that he
did not know if it was going to be necessary, as his
attorneys had not asked him to provide any transcripts for
1993.  Indeed, after he provided his attorneys with the
transcribed excerpts for October and November 1992, they did
not ask him for any more transcripts, per se.[fn 135]

    At the same time that he was revising his diary tapes,
up through May of 1993, Senator Packwood continued to
pinpoint relevant portions of his diaries for his attorneys,
some of them referring to the women who had made allegations
against him.  If these entries were in portions that had
already been transcribed (i.e., 1969-1991) he would provide
a copy of the entry to his attorneys.  If the entries had
not yet been transcribed, he would send a memo to his
attorneys, describing the nature of the entry. Senator
Packwood testified that he sent these excerpts in the form
of memoranda, which might quote from a diary entry, or might
refer to or summarize a diary entry.[fn 136]

    During the same time that he was revising his diary
tapes for 1992 to delete potentially embarrassing or
damaging information, Senator Packwood continued to dictate
contemporaneous daily diary entries.  Despite the fact that
he was simultaneously deleting potentially embarrassing or
politically damaging entries from his 1992 tapes, Senator
Packwood continued to dictate entries of the same character,
entries he would then delete only months later.  At his 1995
deposition, Senator Packwood testified that he did so out of
compulsion, and that he could not change his long-standing
style of dictation.

"After you've dictated for twenty five years, you don't
consciously think of that as you dictate.  You don't say oh,
better not do this, better not do this.  It becomes sort of
a stream of consciousness thinking."

    During his June 1995 appearance before the Committee,
the Senator added that since his attorneys had not requested
any 1993 entries so he did not feel those entries would ever
be requested by them.

          4) Changes to the 1993 Tapes

      Senator Packwood assumed that he gave Ms. Cormack a
fair amount of tapes to transcribe during the spring and
summer of 1993, and thinks that she gave him more typed
transcript during that same time period. Sometime in
mid-summer, or early August of 1993, his attorneys told him
that they wanted all of the 1992- 1993 diaries transcribed.
Realizing then that the transcripts made from the 1993 tapes
could be going to his attorneys, Senator Packwood made
changes to them along the same lines as he had changed his
1992 tapes.[fn 137] Senator Packwood made these changes
shortly before he left for the August recess in 1993.  He
then gave all of the tapes he had, including 1993
up-to-date, to Ms. Cormack to type.[fn 138] He asked her if
she could hurry up and get these tapes transcribed.

      Again, at the same time, Senator Packwood continued to
dictate contemporaneous diary entries of the same character
that he was deleting from his previous tapes, out of
compulsion and in keeping with his long-standing style of
dictation, entries that he would go back and delete only
weeks later. At his June 1995 appearance before the
Committee, Senator Packwood testified as follows:

"BY SENATOR MCCONNELL:

Q: So some time in the first quarter then of 1993, you were
doing some deletions for what you viewed to be embarrassing
material?

A: Yes. I think I'd probably finished listening to the '92
tapes by late April, mid-April, early May, something like
that.

Q: And then contemporaneously, you were continuing your
practice of dictating?

A: Yes.

Q: And the continued practice of the dictating also included
some embarrassing material, did it not?

As Yes.

Q: So you were dictating embarrassing material
contemporaneously while you were also deleting embarrassing
material retroactively?

A: Yes. So long as you understand my dictation habits. I'd
been dictating this for 25 years and it's a stream of
consciousness, pour everything into it, pour my heart into
it, and I was not consciously, when I was dictating, think
now should this be in there, should this be out. That
thought wasn't in my mind. It's only in listening to it, and
I was finding things, did I find things that I wanted to
take out. Bear in mind, I was kind of hoping, by the time
I'd gotten a few months into '93, that they weren't going to
ask for anything more, they'd gotten what they wanted, and I
was sending them along these memos from ' 69, ' 80, or
wherever I'd find some reference to a complainant, a copy of
the diary page that related to that complainant.  And they
weren't asking for anything more what I'd call en masse, so
when I finished the '92, I kind of crossed my fingers and
hoped they wouldn't ask for anything more, wouldn't ask for
all of '92 or '93."

    Senator Packwood testified that in order to make the
changes to his diary tapes for 1992 and 1993, he made a
duplicate copy of the tape, and then made the changes to the
duplicate.  He then copied the duplicate, giving one copy of
the changed tape to Ms. Cormack, and keeping one for
himself.  When Ms. Cormack finished typing any given tape,
he destroyed his corresponding copy.  He retained the
original, unchanged tape.


       5)   Senator Packwood Returns to Oregon Over Recess

     After giving Ms. Cormack his up-to-date diary tapes to
transcribe shortly after the start of the August recess,
Senator Packwood then returned to Oregon for the recess,
taking with him all of his transcribed diaries from 1969
through 1991.  Senator Packwood testified at his deposition
that he was concerned that the press would obtain his
diaries, and he took all of his diary transcripts with him
to Oregon.  A review of the transcripts prior to February
1992 (as far back as 1989) shows that although there are
many entries that would seem to be embarrassing or
potentially damaging if leaked to the press, and which fall
within the same categories as the changes that Senator
Packwood made to the 1992 and 1993 tapes, no changes were
made to these (1989 - 1991) transcripts.

    In his appearance before the Committee, Senator Packwood
testified that he felt no need to delete embarrassing
information from his previously transcribed diaries
(pre-1992) because he was providing to his attorneys only
selected excerpts from these pre- 1992 transcripts, and
there was no fear that other pre-1992 transcripts would be
requested by his attorneys.

    Although Senator Packwood testified that his goal was to
remove entries that would be embarrassing to himself or
others, in substituting one entry in place of an
embarrassing entry he had deleted, Senator Packwood
discussed details of the sex life of one of his long-time
staffers.  When he was asked why he added an entry that was
of the same character as those he was deleting, and how he
thought the press might have reacted to that information,
Senator Packwood stated that he should not have done it, the
entry was factually incorrect, and that in any event it was
obviously in jest.[fn 139]  In fact, an entry in Senator
Packwood's diary dated June 11, 1992 describes an occasion
when he had dinner with this long-time staffer, and she
related to him the information that appears in this later,
substituted entry.

        6)   Senator Packwood Asks Ms. Cormack to Return the
1992 and 1993 Tapes

    Very shortly after the end of the 1993 August recess,
within a day or two of when he came back to town, Senator
Packwood asked Ms. Cormack to give him back the
untranscribed tapes.  He testified that he only wanted the
1993 tapes, but Ms. Cormack gave him all of the tapes,
including the 1992 tapes, in a bag. Senator Packwood stated
that in his rush to make the changes to the 1993 tapes, he
had not made a copy of the changed tapes for himself, and he
wanted the 1993 tapes back so he could make a copy in case
something happened to Ms. Cormack's copy before she had a
chance to transcribe it.  He copied the 1993 tapes, and
returned all of the tapes to Ms. Cormack within days, in two
separate batches.

    Senator Packwood testified that he did not use the word
"subpoena" during whatever conversation he had with Ms.
Cormack about returning the tapes.  He stated that it was
possible that he may have used that word during other
conversations with her, although he had no reason to use
that word, because he was not thinking of the possibility of
a subpoena for his diaries.

    During August and September, Senator Packwood continued
to dictate his diaries, making at least one entry in August
that he deleted after the tape was transcribed.

    At the time he asked Ms. Cormack to return the tapes,
Senator Packwood was somewhat perturbed that Ms. Cormack had
done so little on transcribing the diaries.  He again asked
her to hurry up, and she typed transcripts during September
and October 1993, giving him back pages she had transcribed
from the tapes every few days during that time.  Senator
Packwood delivered these diary pages to his attorneys as Ms.
Cormack finished them.[fn 104] As to the status of her
efforts at this time, Senator Packwood testified as follows
at his January 1995 deposition:

"Q:   Over what period of time did she complete her typing
of the '92 and '93 tapes?

A:   September and October.

Q:   Both months, both full months?

A:   Yeah.  You know, she's got a full-time job, so she
can't type all day long.  There are a lot of tapes, but she
finally got at it...."

    Senator Packwood was aware that as she typed the diaries
during September and October 1993, Ms. Cormack left out a
lot of material.  She had told him that in order to finish
quickly, she needed to consolidate entries, and leave
certain things out - for example, entries dealing with hi6
stereo equipment, and his squash games with another Senator.
Senator Packwood indicated to her that she could do so, and
he left it to her judgment as to what should be left out of
the transcript.

    Senator Packwood testified that in response to requests
from his attorneys, during the fall of 1993, as Ms. Cormack
sought to get the transcripts up to date, he asked her to
type certain entries out of sequence.

    Senator Packwood testified that as Ms. Cormack finished
typing portions of the diary, he erased the corresponding
tape in his possession, which was a duplicate of the changed
tape used by Ms. Cormack.  Ms. Cormack also erased her copy
of the changed tape.  Senator Packwood kept the original
tape, even though it did not correspond to the diary
transcript, because he had historically kept the "original."

     Some time during the fall of 1993, Ms. Cormack asked
Senator Packwood, in an offhand sort of way, if he had made
changes to the diary tapes.  He confirmed to her, either
with words or a smile, that he had done so.

         7)   Changes to October and Early November 1993
Tapes

        Senator Packwood testified that he made no changes
to his diary tapes for September, October, or November
1993.[fn 141] However, Senator Packwood testified that
during late October and possibly early November, as the
pages of the diary covering late October and early November
were typed by Ms. Cormack, he would make changes to them and
have Ms. Cormack retype the pages.  He believes, but cannot
be sure, that all of these types of changes were made only
to entries for October 1993.[fn 142]  Senator Packwood
stated that he may have given Ms. Cormack instructions on
how to retype these pages on a separate tape, with the
entries underlined in yellow on the pages; he did not recall
actually redictating the tapes.  Senator Packwood continued
to make changes to diary entries dictated after his receipt
of the Committee's subpoena, as he did not feel that the
subpoena affected his right to edit his post-subpoena
diaries as they rolled off the press.

    Senator Packwood also continued to erase his copy of the
changed diary tape, even after receipt of the Committee's
subpoena.  In this regard, he testified at his 1995
deposition as follows:

"Q:   So the tapes--when she transcribed during October
after delivery of the subpoena, any tapes that she
transcribed during that period, you would have erased the
duplicate of them?

A:  Yes, I think so.  I'm quite sure I probably did.  To the
extent the transcript is different than the tape, you can
tell the original tape from the transcript.  The transcript
would be the changed one that she typed from which she
erased and I erased and the original would be whatever is in
the transcript you have now is [sic].

The Senator went on to testify as follows:

Q:   Now, as she was completing tapes after your deposition
and your awareness that the Committee was reviewing them,
after she was completing those, and bringing the transcripts
to you, were you then continuing to destroy your copy of the
tape which she had transcribed?

A:   Yes.

Q:   And you presume she was destroying her copy also?

A:   That's what she had done for 15 years.  I didn't think
about it.  It's just what she had been doing over the years.
The thought didn't enter my mind, let's put it that way.

*   *   *

Q:  And just so I'm clear on this, there was never any
instruction, either after the deposition when you understood
that the Committee staff was going to be reviewing
transcripts being prepared by Cathy Cormack or even later
after there had been a subpoena, there was never any
instruction from you to Cathy Cormack to say Cathy, don't
destroy the tapes as as[sic] you make the transcripts?

A:   I don't recall discussing with her at all.

Q:   And, in fact, as you have said, you yourself destroyed
those tapes during that time period as she returned the
transcripts to you?

MR. MUSE: I think he followed the same practice with them.
And also, there are some copies that are still with Judge
Starr that are to be delivered to you that cover this
category.

Q:   Other than the copies that are with Judge Starr [Note:
which turned out to be duplicate unchanged originals], all
the other tapes that matched the changed tapes which you had
given Cathy Cormack, you destroyed those?

A:   That's correct."


    As Senator McConnell pointed out at Senator Packwood's
June 1995 appearance before the Committee, the destruction
of the altered tape by Senator Packwood makes it difficult
to determine which changes were made by whom:

"BY SENATOR MCCONNELL:

Q:   You noted that Ms. Cormack made 99 percent of the
changes to the diary material in the '92-'93 period?

A:   Yes, I think 99 percent would be it, I might be off a
percent but I think that would be a fair--by changes, I mean
including deletions....

Q:   I guess my question is, without a copy of the altered
diary tapes, how can we tell who is responsible for which
deletions or alterations?  In other words, how do we-- these
particular altered tapes, we don't have, is that correct?

A:   That's correct."


        At his January 1995 deposition, Senator Packwood
testified as follows:

"Q:   And at the time now, once you had received the
subpoena and Arnold & Porter had, Cathy Cormack was still
processing some of these tapes, was she not?

MR. MUSE:  Typing transcripts.

BY MR. BAIRD:

Q:   Yes ty~ping transcripts from tapes which you had
previously given her.

A:   Yes, ...certainly she was typing what had come out in
October and November.  She was typing things after the
subpoena.  I don't know at what stage she finished the
backlog.

Q:   But she continued typing throughout the rest of October
and on into November?

A:   Into early November, yeah.

Q:   Once you got the subpoena, did you go to Cathy Cormack
and suggest any changes in her handling of the tapes which
she had had?

A:   No, I didn't.

Q:   Because I think you have told us earlier that it's
possible that during this time, she was still typing on 1992
or 1993 tapes, that that's possible?

A:   She could have been because I remember there was a
portion of '92 tapes.  I think it's early on, February and
March where I never found anything, and it wasn't of
consequence to them.  We'd get to it, but it wasn't as
important to the lawyers I guess as some other period.  She
could have been into the first three or four months of '93
and not have done the first three or four months of '92 or
something like that.

*   *   *

Q:   But in any event, your process, that is Cathy Cormack
typing the tape, sending the transcript to you and your then
destroying the tape that related to that transcript--

A:   My copy of that tape.

Q:   --copy of that tape did not change after you received
the Committee's subpoena; is that correct?

A:   To the best of my knowledge, it did not because I would
not have destroyed the tape until I got the transcript from
Cathy in case something went wrong with her tape.

Q:   So if, in fact, Cathy Cormack transcribed tapes
covering the period of 1992 and returned that transcript to
you after October 21 of '93, you would have destroyed the
corresponding tape?

A:   I think so.  The reason I say I think so, there was
some extra tapes left over that I may not have gotten-- I
think they're September, October and November and they
appear to be around.  And whether I just didn't get to it or
not, by this time we're into a totally different issue of
the law and whether you have a legal right to the diaries
and that whole battle had started, but it was my normal
practice, I think to get rid of them."


    Senator Packwood testified that sometime shortly after
his deposition was interrupted in early October 1993, he
delivered the entire typed transcript to his attorneys.
Thereafter, as Ms. Cormack finished-typing entries, he
provided them to his attorneys.  He did not, however, tell
his attorneys that these transcripts had been typed from
altered tapes.  At his June 1995 appearance before the
Committee he testified as follows on this point:

"BY SENATOR BRYAN

Q.  Did you at any time provide any diary information to
your attorneys that had been changed--and I'm defining
"change" as either a deletion, a substitution, or
addition--without telling them that, look, I did change this
from the original.

A.  Yes.  I'm sure that must have happened because they were
getting these jumping-about portions of 92 and 93, many of
which, or some of which had changes on them."


      The testimony goes on to clarify that his attorneys
were not told about any changes until after the Department
of Justice subpoena of November 19, 1993.

    In his appearance before the Committee, Senator Packwood
testified that if the Committee had gotten up to 1992 in its
review of his diaries, he would not have let the Committee
review the altered transcripts, and he would have notified
his attorneys that he had changed the tapes.  However, even
as the Committee staff was reviewing his already transcribed
diaries during the second week of October, Ms. Cormack was
typing the 1992 and 1993 transcripts from the altered tapes,
as evidenced by the testimony below from the Senator's
January 1995 deposition.

"Q:  Sometime that week after your deposition, you would
have understood, though, that we were, in fact, after your
attorneys had masked certain materials, that the Ethics
Committee staff was reviewing your diaries beginning in 1969
and working our way back to the present, meanwhile Cathy
Cormack is continuing to produce transcript for you;
correct?

A:   Yes.

Q:   Did you understand that the Ethics Committee staff
would also be reviewing the transcripts which Cathy Cormack
was then preparing once those had been masked by your
attorneys?

A:   Assuming you had gotten to those, yes.

*   *   *

Q:   In any event, you did not consider, I take it, once you
knew that the Committee would be reviewing the transcript
which was being produced by Cathy Cormack, you did not
consider having her transcribe from the original as opposed
to the changed?

A:   No.

*   *   *

Q:  When she was in this period after your deposition, she
was typing from changed tapes?

A:   Yes."

     On October 20, 1993, Senator Packwood's attorneys
informed the Committee that about half of the 1992 tapes had
been typed, and would be available for review shortly, and
that the rest of the tapes for 1992 were in the process of
being typed and reviewed.  Thus, it appears that at least
some of the changed tapes covering 1992 and 1993 were typed
after the Senator received the Committee's subpoena on
October 21, 1993 and that those tapes were destroyed after
that date.

        8)   Senator Packwood Reviews Transcripts for
Passages Reflecting Criminal Conduct

    Shortly after the floor debate over the subpoena for his
diaries, when Senator Packwood became aware that the
Committee was earmarking passages in his diaries dealing
with potentially criminal conduct,[fn 143] he retrieved his
diary transcripts from his attorneys,[fn 144] to look for
any entries that might possibly relate to criminal conduct
that would be within the Committee's jurisdiction.  He
returned the diaries to his attorneys within about a week.

    Senator Packwood testified that his attorneys were not
aware that he kept backup tapes for his diaries.  In his
appearance before the Committee, Senator Packwood testified
that he told his attorneys about the backup tapes only after
he received a subpoena from the Department of Justice on
November 19, 1993.  He stated that because the Department of
Justice subpoena could concern criminal matters, he thought
the Department of Justice would want the original tapes.[fn
145]

         9)   Why Senator Packwood Felt Free to Change His
Diaries

    Senator Packwood testified at his January 1995
deposition that he provided his attorneys with relevant
excerpts from his diaries, but that they never turned any of
them over to the Committee in response to the document
requests.  Senator Packwood therefore concluded that the
Committee did not have any right to them.  He also testified
that even after he received the Committee's subpoena, he
never imagined that he could not go back and edit his
diaries as they were being transcribed by Ms. Cormack.  In
this regard, Senator Packwood testified as follows:

"Q:   We had talked just briefly about editing you might
have done to transcripts which you are getting back during
this period, and I think your lawyer, Mr. Stein, suggested
that perhaps we should parse the time periods from before
your deposition and after your deposition in terms of
editing, and I want to focus on that just for a moment. You
had said...that with respect to diary entries after the
deposition, after you were aware that the Committee was
reviewing the tape [sic], the transcripts being prepared by
Cathy Cormack, I believe you had testified, had you not,
that you still felt free to edit entries which were made
after the deposition?

As   Yes.  It never occurred to me that something that I
dictate is forever frozen in time, and I can never edit it
or make a change in it.

Q:   How about for entries which occurred before the date of
the deposition--

MR. MUSE:  What's the question?

MR. BAIRD:  I haven't asked it yet.

Q:  For the time period of tapes which predated your
deposition, when those were processed by Ms. Cormack and
returned to YOU after the deposition, did you feel free to
edit those transcripts?

MR. MUSE:  Victor, you're asking him did he feel free, did
he have consciousness of doing one thing or another or not
doing one thing or another?  The problem I have is you're
asking him what was his mental state about those.

MR. BAIRD:  Yes.

A:   I didn't have a mental state one way or the other. They
didn't come back, and I didn't consciously think to myself I
can't change these or I can change these.  It all kind of
fluxes together so there was no thought.

Q:   But I believe you told us it is possible you may have
edited--

A:   Yes, I may have.

Q:   --some of those after you knew that the transcripts
were going to be reviewed by the Ethics Committee staff?

A:   I may have.  Could I have?  Yes.  I'm sitting there
with diary entries on my desk and my desk piled up and these
transcripts are coming back from Cath and am I looking
through them.  Could I have looked at some, taken it back to
her?  I could have.  I don't know if I did, but I could
have.

Q:   And let's go up to the point of the subpoena.  Does the
situation change any once you have the subpoena, or was that
still--did the process remain the same, that is you could
have changed the transcript that she had given you-- had she
given you any transcript, say, from 1992 that she had done
after the subpoena had been served, that you might possibly
have changed that and given it back to her to make further
changes?

A:   Again, I have no recollection.  I could have, but I'm
just trying--this is such a confusing period for me in
addition to buying my townhouse at the same time or moving
in.  Yes, I could have."


    At other times during his January 1995 deposition,
Senator Packwood testified that while it was possible that
he changed transcripts for entries which predated his
October 1993 deposition after the deposition and after
receiving the Committee's subpoena, he did not think that
this had occurred.

    Senator Packwood went on to testify at his January 1995
deposition that he did not intend to prevent the Committee
from reviewing any information in either the original tapes
or the previously transcribed transcripts.  He reiterated
that he was concerned about leaks to the press.  He also
testified that the Committee eventually received the
original audiotapes.[fn 146]

    In his appearance before the Committee in June 1995,
Senator Packwood testified, in response to questioning, that
he relied on the advice of his attorneys in making changes
to his diaries: because his attorneys had determined that
the Committee was not entitled to his diaries, he felt free
to do with them whatever he wished.  However, Senator
Packwood could not articulate precisely what his attorneys
had told him on this issue.  He repeatedly stated that he
and his attorneys discussed and argued over what he was
required to turn over to the Committee, but that there was
little discussion about what he was not required to turn
over. He did state, however, that the earliest that such
discussions occurred - that is, about whether the Committee
was entitled to his diaries - was after the Committee's
document request of March 29, 1993, at least a full two
months after he had been making changes to his diaries.

    Also in his appearance before the Committee, Senator
Packwood testified that at some stage he had gotten a letter
from the Committee saying that the subpoena would only run
to July 18, 1993, and to the extent he made any changes
after he received that letter, he would have assumed that he
could make any changes that he wanted to entries dated after
that date.  In fact, the Committee did send Senator Packwood
a letter, informing him that although the subpoena called
for all diaries up to the date of the subpoena (October 20,
1993), if he wanted to voluntarily produce his diaries
pursuant to a procedure similar to the original agreement,
the cutoff date of the subpoena would be pushed back to July
18, 1993.  However, this letter was not delivered until
November 9, 1993, and so could not have been a factor in any
changes made before that.  And, according to the Senator,
the only things he would have changed at that time would
have been diary entries made after October 20, 1993.


----------------------------------

Endnotes


109.   Not included in these three categories are
differences that are minor, and appear to be the result of
transcriber error or editing, such as cleaning up grammar
and taking out repetitions.

110.   James Fitzpatrick, one of Senator Packwood's
attorneys at Arnold & Porter, testified that he could not
recall making any request for copies of Senator Packwood's
diary pages, per se. Rather, Senator Packwood was requested
to and did provide his lawyers with a broad range of
information to assist them in representing him, including
his recollection, memoranda, clippings, and summaries of or
excerpts from his diaries.

111.  Mr. Fitzpatrick testified that he could not
specifically recall asking Senator Packwood to get the rest
of his diaries transcribed. Steven Sacks, another attorney
at Arnold & Porter, after consulting with Senator Packwood's
current attorneys, represented that no one who worked on
Senator Packwood's matter at Arnold & Porter could recall
when this request was made, but that July or August 1993
sounded "about right."

112.  In one instance, Senator Packwood deleted an entry
that would be very embarrassing to him and one of his staff
members if it became public, but substituted in its place an
entry that also would have been very embarrassing to a
different staff member if it became public.

113.  Senator Packwood testified that when he changed the
1992 and 1993 tapes, he made a duplicate of the original
tape, and made the changes on the duplicate. He then made a
copy of this changed tape, which he gave to Ms. Cormack to
type. When she completed typing the tape, she destroyed
hers, and he destroyed his.

114.  These diaries cover 1969 through January of 1992.

115.  Senator Packwood did not inform his attorneys that the
transcripts he was delivering to them for 1992 and 1993 had
been typed by Ms. Cormack from the altered tape, and not
from the original, contemporaneous tape.

116.  A letter ~from Senator Packwood's attorneys to the
Committee, dated October 20, 1993,  indicates that
approximately half of 1992 was typed after that date.  This
is consistent with Ms. Cormack's testimony in which she
indicated that during mid to late October, she was really
pushing to get the diaries transcribed.

117.  For the years 1989, 1990, and 1991, these backup tapes
would correspond with the written transcript.  For 1992 and
1993, however, they would not, because they were typed from
a duplicate of the original, on which Senator Packwood had
made the changes. This duplicate was destroyed after it was
transcribed.

118.  Indeed, the Cormack transcripts received by the
Committee are not numbered after January 1992.

119.  In her second deposition, taken in December 1993, Ms.
Cormack could not place the time of this conversation any
more precisely than sometime between early September and mid
to late October, although she was asked several times, and
in several different ways, to do so.  When her deposition
was taken again a year later, in December 1994, Ms. Cormack
recalled that this conversation took place in early
September.

120.  Ms. Cormack did not complete her transcription until
at least November 9, 1993, which was the last date she
transcribed.

121.  The diaries themselves strongly suggest that Senator
Packwood and Ms. Cormack had a very close personal
relationship.

122.  Senator Packwood testified that Ms. Cormack did
"modest" work for him, although he could not recall what it
was. In contrast, Ms. Cormack testified that after she left
Senator Packwood's staff, she performed no work for him
other than transcribing his diaries.

123.  Senator Packwood testified that he sometimes made
another duplicate, if for some reason he thought the
original tape might be of poor quality.

124.   Ms. Cormack testified that historically, Senator
Packwood asked her to make changes in the typed transcript
no more than five times.

125.   This was a calendar in which Senator Packwood
recorded his activities for the day after the fact, as
opposed to a calendar which listed his appointments.

126.  Senator Packwood confirmed, as do his diary entries,
that he reviewed his diaries before his 1993 deposition.

127.  Senator Packwood testified that he had an independent
recollection of these occasions.

128.  Senator Packwood testified that he had an independent
recollection of this 1969 event and conversation.

129.  Senator Packwood also recounted this incident, and the
conversation, word for word, in early November 1993 during
debate on the Senate floor over the subpoena for his
diaries.

130.  Ms. Cormack testified that at the time Senator
Packwood asked her to type entries out of sequence, she had
"some" tapes for 1992, possibly tapes going up to, but not
covering the period surrounding the general election. Ms.
Cormack also testified that when she typed the entries out
of sequence for Senator Packwood in early January 1993, she
did not number the pages. The Cormack transcripts are
numbered up through the end of January 1992.

131.  About fifteen (15) entries concerning communications
with Committee Members, mostly Senator McConnell, appeared
to have been changed, some by deletion, others by deletion
and substitution of new language.

132.  In fact, a review of the transcripts prepared from the
1992 and 1993 tapes shows that many entries which would have
been highly embarrassing were not changed.

133.  There is no evidence to suggest that any diary
material was ever leaked by Senator Packwood's attorneys or
their office.

134.  Later in his deposition, Senator Packwood stated that
he finished making the changes to the 1992 tapes by the end
of February or March, or in early April, 1993.

135.  Although Senator Packwood forwarded excerpts that he
selected from his diaries to his attorneys through the
spring of 1993, his attorneys did not ask him to turn over
any portion of his diaries in toto until after the Committee
specifically requested them in October 1993. The exception
to this was the diaries for the October-November 1992 period
which the Senator provided to his lawyers sometime in
January 1993.  The Senator testified that after he provided
these diaries, his attorneys told him to stop transcribing
his 1992-93 tapes.

136.  These memoranda were withheld from the Committee on
the grounds of attorney-client and work-product privilege.

137.  Senator Packwood also testified that he deleted
entries in which he recorded unflattering comments about his
attorneys, a friend, and his marriage counselor.

138.  Senator Packwood thought that Ms. Cormack had the 1992
tapes by this time.

139.  At his appearance before the Committee, Senator
Packwood repeated that he had made up this entry about his
long-time staffer, and that she had never told him about her
private life as reflected in the substituted entry.

140.  According to Senator Packwood's attorneys, they
received the first set of transcripts from Senator Packwood
on October 7, 1993.  These transcripts, which were numbered,
covered 1969 through January 1992.

141.  It appears that the tapes that Senator Packwood gave
Ms. Cormack in early August prior to departure on recess
would have brought him up to August 5, since there is a tape
which ends August 5, 1993 and a new tape which begins on
August 5, 1993 and extends well into the August recess.  The
tape that covers the August time period after August 5,
which was not included in the group given to Ms. Cormack
because it was still in use by Senator Packwood, had several
entries that were changed.  Senator Packwood testified that
he made these changes when he was finished with that tape,
after he came back from recess.

142.  There are only two entries in September, October, and
November 1993 where a passage appearing on the tape does not
appear on the Cormack transcript, and a different passage is
substituted.  These entries appear on October 9 and 10,
1993.

143.  On the evening of November 1, 1993, after the first
day of floor debate, the Senator, his attorneys, the
Chairman and Vice Chairman, and staff counsel met to discuss
a proposal by Senator Packwood for production of his
diaries.  Senator Packwood testified that this meeting was
the first time he became aware of the nature of the
potential criminal activity that the Committee was
interested in.  This precise information had been provided
to Senator Packwood's attorneys by staff on October 18,
1993.

144.   Senator Packwood's diary indicates that he retrieved
his diaries from his attorneys on October 31, 1993, which he
confirmed at his deposition.  He stated that at that time he
took the volumes for 1989, 1990, and 1991.

145.  The Committee's subpoena, which Senator Packwood
received almost a month earlier, specifically asked for all
diaries, both tapes and transcripts for the period from
November 1, 1989 to October 20, 1993.

146.  Of course, the Committee did not have access to the
original audiotapes until after the matter was litigated to
the Supreme Court and Senator Packwood was ordered to
produce them.




     3.   Testimony of James Fitzpatrick

    In order to confirm information provided by Senator
Packwood at his deposition about requests that his attorneys
had made for his diaries, and Senator Packwood's transmittal
of diaries to his attorneys, the staff took the deposition
of James Fitzpatrick of Arnold & Porter.  Arnold & Porter
represented Senator Packwood from late 1992 up until shortly
before the hearing before Judge Jackson in December 1993;
they terminated their representation on November 22, 1993.
Also present at the deposition were Jacob Stein and Robert
Muse, Senator Packwood's current attorneys, who were in
attendance solely to raise objections, if necessary, to
questions that implicated the attorney-client privilege.
Mr. Fitzpatrick was represented by Stephen Sacks, an
attorney at Arnold & Porter.

    Mr. Fitzpatrick testified that Arnold & Porter began
providing legal representation to Senator Packwood in the
late fall of 1992, after the general election.  This
representation continued to November 22, 1993.

         a.   Requests for Information from Senator Packwood

    Mr. Fitzpatrick testified that from the beginning, they
were asking Senator Packwood to provide information and
facts that might help them to prepare his defense.  He does
not specifically recall asking Senator Packwood to provide
diary entries relating to allegations then under
consideration, either sexual misconduct or intimidation of
witnesses.  Rather, they made requests for information from
a broad variety of sources, and they received information
from Senator Packwood from a broad variety of sources,
including diary material, clippings, memoranda, and
recollections.

    The attorneys at Arnold & Porter were aware that Senator
Packwood kept diaries.  Along the way, they received
material from him that either referred to or summarized the
diaries, and in some instances contained specific excerpts
from the diaries. Mr. Fitzpatrick did not know the precise
date when they first received any memoranda containing
excerpts or entries from the diaries, although it would have
been sometime in 1993.  Although he did not have an
independent recollection of the particular date that any
document was received from Senator Packwood, he stated that
the privilege log provided to the Committee on August 3.
1993. would reflect any documents that they received from
Senator Packwood, but which were withheld from the Committee
on the grounds of privilege.[fn 147]

    Mr. Fitzpatrick did not recall any specific conversation
directing the Senator to review his diaries to look for
entries that might relate to the intimidation issue.  As
they tried to master the facts, they did ask the Senator for
any information that might be relevant to the charges,
instructing him broadly to provide information that would be
helpful.  There may have been a conversation dealing with
diaries.

    Among the materials that they received from Senator
Packwood during the course of 1993, there were some
references to the October to November 1992 time period,
although he did not know when the particular memo discussing
this time period was provided to them.

    After some discussion among Senator Packwood's former
and current attorneys, it was represented by Mr. Sacks that
the first memorandum that was provided to Arnold & Porter,
attaching diary entries or excerpts, was dated January 7,
1993, and that the entries covered the period of October to
November 1992.

    Mr. Fitzpatrick testified that some of the diary entries
excerpted or discussed in the memoranda provided to them by
Senator Packwood might have included the names of women who
were making allegations of sexual misconduct against Senator
Packwood, although he recalled that there was no reference
in the diaries to any incident that had been alleged.

    b.   Failure to Provide Relevant Diary Entries to the
Committee

    Mr. Fitzpatrick was asked whether Arnold 6 Porter had
provided any diary entries to the Committee in responding to
the Committee's two document requests on behalf of Senator
Packwood. He stated that they responded in good faith to the
requests, supplying material that was responsive to the
requests, and that any material that was called for that
they did not produce was identified on the privilege log.[fn
148]  At different times in his deposition, he stated that
the diary entries that contained references to women who had
made claims of sexual misconduct were both outside the scope
of the Committee's request, and within the scope of the
Committee's request, but subject to a privilege.  He
testified that to the extent that the material might have
been responsive to the request, but protected by a
privilege, it was noted on the privilege log.  He would not
concede that the fact that the privilege log sets out
memoranda that incorporated diary entries means that Arnold
& Porter made a judgment that the diary entries were within
the scope of the Committee's request.

    Mr. Fitzpatrick testified that not all of the 112 items
identified on the privilege log related to diary excerpts,
but they were a wide range of memoranda, some having nothing
to do with the diaries.

    c.   Receipt of Diary Transcripts from Senator Packwood

     On October 7, 1993, Arnold & Porter received from
Senator Packwood a series of volumes in black notebooks,
purporting to be the diaries from 1969 through part of 1992.
They were kept locked in Arnold & Porter's offices.  They
reviewed the diaries, masked them for review by Committee
staff, and provided them for review in the presence of an
Arnold & Porter representative until the reviewing agreement
broke down.

    Mr. Fitzpatrick testified that Arnold & Porter continued
to receive additional transcripts after October 7, 1993.
Mr. Fitzpatrick believes that they then asked Senator
Packwood to bring his diaries up to date for the Committee's
review.  After a discussion between Mr. Fitzpatrick, Mr.
Sacks, Mr. Muse, and Mr. Stein, Mr. Sacks represented that
Arnold & Porter requested that Senator Packwood transcribe
his diaries some time in July or August of 1993, as best as
they could ascertain.  However, Mr. Fitzpatrick himself
could not recall asking Senator Packwood to have the
remainder of his diaries transcribed at that time.  Mr.
Sacks represented that that was the recollection of one of
the attorneys in the group who was in communication with the
Senator's office:  Dan Rezneck, Mike Korens, Leigh McAfee,
and possibly others.  He had no idea who specifically made
such a request on any given date, but it "sounds right" to
all of them that the request to have the 1992 and 1993
diaries transcribed was made in the July-August time
period.[fn 149]

    Later in his deposition, Mr. Fitzpatrick testified that
they received transcribed diary pages in addition to the
material in the binders that they received on October 7,
including entries from 1992, but he does not recall when
they received those pages, or even whether they were
received before or after Senator Packwood's deposition, or
before or after the delivery of the binders on October 7.
He does know that some time during the period after October
7, they received additional pages dealing with 1992 and
1993, although he could not give a precise date. But he
could not recall if they got this material before or after
they received the binders.

    Mr. Sacks stated that the first diary information Arnold
& Porter received was on October 7, which covered 1969
through part of 1992.  Thereafter, additional information
from the diaries was provided for the remainder of 1992 and
portions of 1993.

    Mr. Fitzpatrick recalled that all of the diary pages
they received on October 7 were numbered, but he did not
recall whether the pages received after that date were.[fn
150]

    On October 31, 1993, Senator Packwood took back the
volumes for 1989 and 1990.  On November 5, he returned these
volumes, and took the volumes from 1991.  On November 6, he
returned the 1991 volumes, and took the 1992 volumes, which
he returned on November 9.

         d.   Receipt of Diary Tapes from Senator Packwood

    Arnold & Porter received the original tapes of the
previously transcribed diaries on November 22, 1993.  These
tapes covered a time period starting in 1969, and going
forward, although Mr. Fitzpatrick does not recall the end
date of the tapes.  It had been their understanding that the
tapes of the transcribed diaries were destroyed; they first
learned that such tapes existed on the evening of November
21.  They received the tapes the next day, November 22,
1993, and terminated their representation of Senator
Packwood.

 4.   Specific Entries From the Diary

    For the most part, with some exceptions, the focus has
been on those entries in the diaries where material that was
on the audiotape did not appear on the Cormack transcript,
and different entries were substituted in their place.  This
is the case for several reasons.  First, there were a great
number of entries on the audiotape that did not appear in
the Cormack transcript that dealt with subjects which were
not related to the Committee's inquiry, or did not involve
conduct that would be subject to the Committee's
jurisdiction.[fn 151]

    Additionally, it was just as likely that these entries
had been left out by Cathy Cormack as she hurried to finish
transcribing the diaries.  Indeed, she testified that she
did leave out a large number of entries that she considered
unimportant.

    Most importantly, with respect to those entries where
material was added to the Cormack transcript in the place of
material that had been on the audiotape, those changes had
been made not by the transcriber, Ms. Cormack, but by
Senator Packwood.  There is a limited number of such
entries, and many of them deal with information on the
audiotape that relates to the Committee's inquiry, or that
could possibly implicate Senator Packwood in misconduct
within the Committee's jurisdiction.

    Diary entries in the following categories are set out
below, with the original audiotape version on the left, and
the corresponding version from the transcript typed by Ms.
Cormack from tapes altered by Senator Packwood on the right.
The portions that are on the audiotape but were left out of
the Cormack transcript are underlined and in italics, while
the portions that are not on the audiotape, but were added
to the transcript, are underlined and in bold letters.
[Editor's note: In this version the changes are set off by
carats.]

--- Entries dealing with the Committee's inquiry into
allegations of sexual misconduct and intimidation;

--- Entries dealing with campaign activity and use of
Senator Packwood's Senate office for campaign purposes.

    Following these entries is also a summary of other
entries that were changed by Senator Packwood, referring to
his negotiations with the Oregon Citizens Alliance during
his 1992 campaign; contacts with Committee members by
Senator Packwood in regard to the inquiry; and entries
relating to Senator Packwood's acceptance or solicitation of
contributions by lobbyists to his legal defense fund.


     a.   Entries Dealing with the Committee's Inquiry into
Allegations of Sexual Misconduct and Intimidation

AUDIOTAPE

February 5, 1993

Elaine called, had a sad message.  Channel 2 has said that
five more women are willing to come forward to say they've
been sexually abused by me or sexually harassed or
something, including one in the early '90s.  I said to
Elaine, can't be employees if they are - these are five
Oregon women.   She said one of them could be [Complainant
1]. <<I said well, I hope so, but we're going to take her
hard.>> She said you and I know it cannot be employees in
the Oregon office in the '80s. <<It could be [former staff
member] from the '70s. I didn't say this to her, but it
could.>>

CORMACK TRANSCRIPT

Elaine called with a sad message.  Channel 2 has said that
five more women are willing to come forward to say they have
been sexually abused by me or harassed or something,
including one in the early '80s.   These are five women.  I
said, "It can't be employees."  She said, "One could be
[Complainant 1]."  I said, <<"Well  yes  but she's a
habitual liar.  We know that. We can prove that.  That will
surely blow down her testimony.">>  I said, "You and I know
it cannot be employees in the office in the '80s.


    At his deposition, Senator Packwood testified that
Complainant 1 was a chronic troublemaker, who lied and
fantasized, and could not be trusted, although he could not
identify anyone on his staff who had made complaints about
her, nor could he produce any records reflecting such
complaints.  Nor do his diaries reflect any such problems
with Complainant 1, even though the Senator routinely and
often harshly critiqued the performance of members of his
staff.

    The former staff member referred to in the audiotape,
whose name does not appear in the Cormack transcript,
appears to be someone the Senator thought could be a
potential complainant. However, the Senator testified that
it never would have occurred to him that this person could
be a complainant.

    The information substituted in the Cormack transcript
serves to document the Senator's claims that Complainant 1
was a "habitual liar."  It also leaves out any mention of a
former staff member who it appears that Senator Packwood
thought might be a potential complainant.

    Senator Packwood guessed that he had deleted the
information about the former staff member, because her name
had never appeared in the press and he did not want to give
the press another lead to chase down.  He testified that
this change had nothing to do with the Committee.  While he
was changing that, he thought that he would put in the truth
about Complainant 1.

    At his appearance before the Committee in June 1995,
Senator Packwood was questioned about this alteration by
Senator Bryan as follows:

"BY SENATOR BRYAN

Q:   But, Senator, my point is you knew that in February of
1993.  I mean, by your own statement you knew by February
5th of 1993, that at least in your opinion she was, you
know, not to be trusted and was a liar, but you didn't say
that in the dictated portion of the audiotape.  Sometime
between February 5th 1993, and the later part of 1993--and
you may be able to tell us when--you went back and changed
that.

A:   I am confused now.

Q:   Well, February 5th 1993, you dictated the statement
about her.  Then, the Cormack transcript--

*   *   *

A:   Okay.  Cathy's is the one that said, "Well, yes, but
she's an habitual liar.  We know that."  Is that--

Q:   Yes.  And that is the alteration.  My point being, that
doesn't seem to have anything to do with embarrassment or
protecting somebody from any sense of awkwardness.  And the
fact that it was made, Senator, just a few months after the
original entry was dictated, at least raises a question as
to what the motive was.  You knew in February of 1993 that
this was not a good and trusted employee.  You have
indicated that you found that out.  And one would think that
you would characterize that in your February 5th 1993
original audiotape.  When you go back to make the change,
you put this negative characterization in--which may be
accurate; we don't know--but I mean that is a change that
doesn't seem to fit in with the general rubric of
embarrassment, or trying to avoid hurt or harm to someone.

A:   Well, first, as I indicated, when I took that one, one
of my reasons was [Complainant 1] name being mentioned there
who had never been in the press, and who for other reasons
she would not want her name out.  And at the time, I am
simply dictating that, and--you give a preciseness to this
that is not precise.  I think you almost think that-- again,
I am not looking at something.  I am  listening to
something--that with strict attention you hear every bit and
you think to yourself every change you're going to make.
Whether I not[sic] put in in[sic] the original transcript
she's a liar, I didn't.  I knew she was at the time.  I'm
not sure the fact that I failed to put it in is indicative
of anything.
"


AUDIOTAPE

February 12. 1993

This was the bad day.   First, we discovered that Gina is
going to have a press conference in Eugene.  This is Gina
Hutton, my 1980 campaign chair, who appeared in a story this
week that I tried to kiss her.  Then Lindy Paull called and
said she wants to put out a statement to the Oregonian -
that a statement she submitted said nothing about women's
past sexual history, and she was quite adamant she doesn't
want to be associated with that kind of attack, as she
regards.  She was pissed.  She was so pissed, I think she
may resign, and of course, she's a hot property and she'll
do well.  <<Then I called Tim Lee, just to remind him not to
talk to the Dress. and he said well,  had called again. and
[name omitted] always shuts off the calls and [name omitted]
says he doesn't want to talk to any paper that's got a
vendetta against Senator Packwood. and says it's not a
vendetta against Senator Packwood. It's against Elaine.>>

* * * * *

<<Now we've got further problems. Lindy Paull -- with the
story the Oregonian is going to do listing the people who
gave names of The Washington Post. Lindy Paull's name, of
course, is going to be mentioned.  She gave a perfectly
harmless statement that her statement about the lack of
Complainant 1's professionalism, but she wants to call the
Oregonian and make it very specific, have them make it very
specific that her statement did not relate in any way to
sexual misconduct or past history. Then Josie wants to call
the Oregonian to find out what their story is going to be
about.  Elaine and Julie called her back from the road and
she was very curt, very short when Elaine says to what end
do you want to find out?  She said I don't have to tell you.
Elaine called [name omitted] and says let's face it, some of
those that play in the big leagues - don't play in the big
leagues are going to bail out.  You might as well assume
that the nonpoliticals will bail out.  And I says yeah, but
- I said later to Elaine. Josie is a political. [name
omitted] says you don't know who may bail out.>>

of the minority staff, she is popular with the women, she is
popular with the tax lawyers. She'll have no difficulty
getting a very good job.>> *   *   *   *


    The Committee's original inquiry included allegations
that Senator Packwood had attempted to intimidate potential
witnesses, and that he had used staff members in an attempt
to do so.  These allegations were ultimately found by the
Ethics Committee not to be supported by substantial credible
evidence, but at the time the diary changes were made it was
a matter under inquiry by the Ethics Committee.  Ms. Paull,
who worked for Senator Packwood on the Finance Committee,
provided Senator Packwood with a statement about Complainant
1, which he forwarded to the Washington Post. This entry
indicates that Ms. Paull, along with other staffers, may
have had concerns about the use of their statements by the
Post.  It also indicates that Senator Packwood did not want
Tim Lee, who had provided a statement about another
complainant, to talk to the press about it.

    The material that was added to the Cormack transcript is
entirely different, deleting any indication that Lindy Paull
was uncomfortable with her statement, and painting a
flattering picture of Ms. Paull, who gave the statement
about the Complainant 1, whose allegation involved a 1990
incident that occurred after the staff party at the Irish
Times.

    Senator Packwood testified that he did not recall making
the changes to the first entry on this date, but looking at
it, he was sure that he must have done it.  He stated that
he wanted to take out the reference to him telling Tim Lee
not to talk to the press.  He added the flattering material
about Lindy Paull out of compulsion, because he had a space
left on the tape.  He stated that sometimes he filled in
these spaces, and sometimes he did not.  He could not say
whether he or Ms. Cormack was responsible for leaving out
the second entry on this date.

My normal morning errands, then into the office about 9:00
for a few hours, worked, <<played a couple hands of cards.
I really didn't do a lot of work.>>  Did some thank you
letters to people that are giving money to the trust - legal
trust fund.

    << Looked through the diary to see when the famous night
with [Staffer 1] was. I don't know why I have a feeling that
she might say something - I don't know why. It's probably
good she's leaving.>>

CORMACK TRANSCRIPT

Into the office, after my normal morning errands, where I
worked for a few hours. Some thank-you letters to some
people who've given to the legal defense fund.  <<We're not
doing as well as I'd hoped and I doubt we'll be able to
raise money I need until after this matter is resolved.
Gosh. I hope it can be resolved soon. Who knows.>>

    The deleted entry indicates that Senator Packwood was
worried that Staffer 1 (who left his office shortly after
this entry) could possibly "say something," in other words,
that she might become a complainant against him.

    Senator Packwood testified that he guessed he deleted
the references to Staffer 1 from the audiotape, as there was
no point in involving her in anything.  He stated that there
were a number of times where he caught her name throughout
the diaries, and he took it out.  He was trying to protect
her from hounding by the press.  He did not think that Ms.
Cormack would have left out this entry.[fn 152]

Got home about 6:30.  Cooked some soup.  Got a phone call

Elaine.  She had just received, because they didn't know who
to deliver it to in the office, a motion to produce
documents, voluminous documents, memos, correspondence,
phone calls, personal papers.  I wonder if that includes
diaries. Everything.  I was scared to death.

    << At this stage, there was a vote call, so I came back
into the office. And I see Dan Resnick [Senator Packwood's
attorney] had called. So I called him. Elaine had already
talked with him. He said, well, let's not panic yet.  Let me
review this document they've sent us. But I said, my God,
some of the early memos before you were retained will be
very - some of them would be very incriminating. Stayed for
a couple hours and went through the entire series of books
that I had, as best I could, the hinders.  There is some
damaging stuff.  Actually, least of all damaging is probably
the diaries, because in it there would be nothing about
being a rejected suitor only my successful exploits.

didn't know because I hadn't reread them but my hunch is
that it they would show I'd spent a lot of time with Gena
Hutton and time with others after the alleged incidents.  I
also told her I would take care of everything. that I would
protect her. we would represent her. we were entitled to.
we'd raise the money. and that I was very concerned for her
well-being. She was most comforted.  This was one of those
situations where I had to be the strong person and she had
to rely on

    Went to bed.>>


    This entry was made on the date that Senator Packwood
received the Committee's first request for documents.  It
indicates that Senator Packwood was concerned that he had
incriminating documents that could be subject to the
Committee's request, and his fear that his diaries might be
included in the request.

    Senator Packwood testified that he thought that he
deleted the information from the audiotape, and substituted
the information that appears on the Cormack transcript.  He
took the information out of the audiotape because he did not
want the press to see an entry indicating that he told his
attorney that some of his memos would be very incriminating.
He added the information that appears in the Cormack
transcript just to fill a gap .

    In his appearance before the Committee, Senator Packwood
stated that at the time he changed this passage, in the
summer of 1993, the Committee already had his memos,
implying that there would be no reason for him to want to
hide this entry from the Committee.  However, Senator
Packwood withheld 112 documents, many of them memoranda,
from the Committee on the grounds of attorney-client
privilege.  The privilege log indicates that six of the
memoranda were dated before the time when Senator Packwood's
attorneys were retained.  Thus, it is impossible to
determine whether in fact the Committee received the memos
referred to in this entry.  Moreover, regardless of whether
the Ethics Committee had the memos when Senator Packwood
changed the tape, this entry evidences Senator Packwood's
state of mind when he received the Committee's document
request on March 29, 1993. Senator Packwood's state of mind
was discussed at length at his June 1995 appearance before
the Committee:

"BY SENATOR DORGAN

Q:   This is in March in 1993, and you were provided with a
motion by the Committee to produce documents, and so on. At
that point you say:  I wonder if that includes diaries?
Everything?  I was scared to death.  And then you said:
'But, I said, my God, some of the early memos before you
were retained will be very--some of them are very
incriminating,' and so on.  Then you look at the transcript
from Cormack, and when you look at this sort of thing you
wonder to yourself, gee, isn't this a circumstance where
somebody just, first of all, was alerted that they have
information that probably is the subject of the motion and
probably should be produced at some point, or there may be a
question whether it should be produced, and then you go in
and you make some alterations that would lead those who
eventually got the transcript to a conclusion substantially
different.  So I'm just wondering.  You know, when you look
at this, if you put one face on it it looks like just
flat-out alteration of diaries in order to prevent the
Committee from seeing what it wanted to see.  And you've
described it in another way, but with respect to this
particular instance it looks like in March of 1993 you at
least were alerted, yourself, to the possibility that these
diaries might have to go to the Committee.

A:   Yes.  Although, if I read this correctly, the reference
to "diaries" is not taken out in either one, is it?

Q:   No, no.  My point isn't that you took out the reference
to diaries.

A:   Oh, I see.

Q:   I make two points with this.  One is, in March of 1993
you at that point were alarmed in your own mind that you
might have to produce diaries, but you wondered whether you
had to produce diaries to the Committee that early on.  The
point is, later you were altering a lot of transcripts,
including this one, apparently, on the tape, and you did
alter this one in a manner that took out the reference to
some incriminating--some memos that could be incriminating
and so on.  So that material that you altered here would
obviously be altered if one would look at it that way, and
it would obviously be altered to take information out which
would be harmful to yourself.

A:   Well,...I should say I knew exactly what I was talking
about here--but in talking to Resnick, they have--in fact,
they gave you the memos, as a matter of fact.  These are
some of the ones I argued with them about that I didn't want
to go to you, and they gave them to you.  But... If I was
changing this to fool the Committee, you already had the
documents that I didn't want to go to you.  But would you
want out in the press a statement, God there's incriminating
documents--I mean, I don't use the word incriminating" in
the sense of criminal, but I can picture a press saying
criminal or Packwood has criminal documents.  So indeed I
changed this, obviously, sometime-- this is March of
'93--sometime in July of '93, but it's the kind of thing I
wouldn't want out.

But if the argument is that I was changing these in October,
apparently, or after the subpoena, to fool the Committee you
already had the documents.  If I was changing it to fool the
Committee, you asked me yesterday about [person], if I was
changing it in October, you'd already deposed me about her.
I wouldn't have been taking it out to keep it from you, you
had it...you cannot sense...fear of the press and what they
were doing to me...But do you understand what I mean?  That
if I took this out when I think someone would say I was
taking it out, it was an irrelevancy....

BY SENATOR MCCONNELL

Q:   But wasn't the other question, wholly aside from the
issue of alteration, was not the other question whether the
dictation indicated that at the time it crossed your mind
that the diaries might be something the Committee--

 A:   Well, and it may have been at this stage that they
said, no.  I'm not quite sure....

*   *   *   *

BY SENATOR BRYAN

Q:   ...as I understand what [Senator Dorgan's] point is
is[sic] that you were somewhat concerned or alarmed in March
that you might have to turn over the diaries, and so the
question at least in our mind is:  If that is so, why would
you not then have informed your attorney that indeed there
was an original audiotape?  At least it gives rise to
express some concern as to any changes made thereafter, that
you had at least in your thought, I might have to produce
these diaries....

A:   Counsel just called to my attention that March 29th was
the date of the document request.  Maybe this was when the
lawyer said, well, we don't have to turn the diaries over.
I don't know.  I can't remember....

Q:   I think the point that Senator Dorgan,...is it's not a
question of what you may have legally been required to turn
over, it was what was your state of mind.  And if this entry
is accurate, it would suggest that your state of mind was
one of considerable concern that the diary materials
contained incriminating information.  And then,
apparently...the changed part changes the thrust of the
meaning entirely....

A:   Well, again, and I'm saying if you're suggesting that I
changed this--well, as a matter of fact, when I changed this
the Committee had the documents.  If this is 1993, this
change was made in late July or the first of August and you
already had the documents.  I don't take out any reference
to the diaries.  I take out references to the incriminating
documents, and you had them.

And I said of course I'd help him [former staffer]. <<Then
he asked if he could talk to me personally for a moment.  I
excused staff, and he simply said Lee McAfee [attorney for
Senator Packwood] had called him and he said he was happy
not only to talk to Leo [sic], although he didn't have much
to say other than [former staffer/complainant] claim, shit
[sic], she threw him out of her apartment, which is
absolutely untrue.  He says that she made moves on him>> and
he said he'd love to be a character witness for me, that he
perhaps is on the road 120 days with me and never saw any of
the untoward conduct, any of the force, any of the
aggressiveness that's alleged. I thought it was very sweet
of him.

CORMACK TRANSCRIPT

I said of course I would try to help him.  He also said he
would be happy to be a character witness for me if I wished
- that he perhaps was on the road 120 days with me and never
saw any of the untoward conduct or aggressiveness that's
being alleged.  I thought that was very sweet of him.


    The former staffer referred to in this entry provided
Senator Packwood with a very derogatory statement about
another former staffer/complainant, claiming that on a
certain occasion, she acted sexually aggressively toward the
former staffer, which Senator Packwood forwarded to the
Washington Post.  The deleted passage indicates that the
former staffer/complainant may have had a different version
of the incident with the former staffer.[fn 153]

    Senator Packwood testified that the portion of the
audiotape that was left out of the Cormack transcript was
the kind of deletion that he would have made, although there
were parts of it that he would rather have left in, as far
as they concerned the former staffer/complainant.  But if
this entry were to come out, that the former staffer had
offered to say something about the former
staffer/complainant, the press would be all over the former
staffer.  He agreed that he had already given the Washington
Post a statement by the former staffer about the former
staffer/complainant, but he did not believe that his name
had appeared in public at the time of this diary entry.

    Senator Packwood stated that he would have made these
changes in late July or early August 1993, very close to the
recess time.


AUDIOTAPE

June 29. 1993

Fundraiser was fine.  On the way home, <<I discovered
something that was disturbing, however.  S-1 had told S-2
about our evening in the office, only she told S-2, the way
she told it to me. and she's straight out lying.  She says
we were drinking.  She admitted she was drunk, and that I
came out of the bathroom nude.  And then I didn't ask S-2,
did she say we had a sexual relationship where I forced
myself on her or what? I should have thought to pursue it.
I did not tell S-2 the specifics of what I remember from my
diary because I didn't want S-2 to know it was in the diary,
but goddamn. S-1 used the same expression, a statistic - she
felt like a stat - a statistic.  And then S-2 said that S-3
used the word statistic. I'll bet anything S-1 has told this
to S-3.

      Now, interestingly, she told S-2 just a few days
before she left here. this is about the same time she told
me, in exactly the same story as if she's  trying to build a
case. and she tells everybody three years - well. it 1s
three years after the event. Came here in '89 - I think she
came in '89. and she's not telling them about the time she
came into my office and another time when she practically
put it to me. She's not telling them about the time she took
me home from the Crawfords after swimming, lay on my bed.
took off her blouse. took off her bra and asked me to rub
some aloe on her very badly burned skin from the sunburn at
the Crawfords. I won't describe in full detail her what
happened while we were doing that, but it was a lot more
than rubbing aloe on her bare back.

*  *  *  *

I had also forgot to say I called Lee McAfee after S-2
dropped me off and told her what S-2 had told me, and Lee
said this is very important because S-1 had never told Lee
about the consensual situation. She had alleged some other
groping or grasping when I was drunk and admits that I was
drunk, is what she said to me. She wasn't really mad about
it even. But she's never said anything about our consensual
relations.  Lee says it's quite helpful.  S-2 also said that
S-1 confronted her and then said well, there must be - I
think this is what she said - now, I may get it confused - I
think S-1 said to S-2 well, of course, you've had a
relationship with the senator.  S-2 said she has looked at
her And said no. Now, I may have had that confused with what
S-2 said to S-3 and S-3 said to S-2 that S-1 on one occasion
said to S-3, you know, the senator and S-2 must be having a
relationship, and S-3 said no, I don't think so. Well, I
don't know what to make of all this.

CORMACK TRANSCRIPT

   The fundraiser was fine and on the way home <<we again
kidded about S-2's relationship with that fellow she'd been
sleeping with or nooning with. I guess, three times a week
for seven years. And S-2 goes, "Oh for heaven's sake. I
shouldn't have ever told you that."  And she acted put out
much like the way [name omitted] would act with a slight
difference in emphasis.

   And I thought to myself - would I have to courage to do
that. I'm trying to think of what would be the federal
equivalent in Oregon and there is none because we don't have
a big federal presence. But let's say they were going to
move a thousand people from the Corps of Engineers
headquarters or five  hundred people from the Forest Service
regional headquarters.  There may be that many.  Would I
have the courage that [name omitted] did? I don't know.>>


    The deleted passages discuss Senator Packwood's concerns
that the staffer, S-1, who is also referred to in the March
20, 1993 entry above, might "build a case."  These entries,
as well as an entry for November 29, 1989, indicate that
Senator Packwood had a consensual sexual relationship with
this staff member while she worked for him.[fn 154]  It also
suggests that there could have been non-consensual aspects
to Senator Packwood's relationship with that staffer, which
created his concern that this staffer might talk to the
Committee. [fn 155]

     Senator Packwood testified that he thought he was
responsible for the deletions in the first entry for this
date, and the corresponding substitutions to the Cormack
transcript. He was asked by Counsel why he made the changes,
and he testified that he took this passage out of the
audiotape because he did not want the press to have it.
However, despite his testimony that he was worried that the
press would obtain his diaries, and he was reviewing them
during the first half of 1993 and over the August 1993
recess, Senator Packwood did not delete the November 29,
1989 entry, which recounts the "famous night" and is at
least as explosive as the deleted June 29, 1993 entry.

    Senator Packwood was asked why he had substituted
embarrassing details in the Cormack transcript about another
staffer's (S-2's) personal life.  He stated that it was
"kind of facetious," and not entirely true.  He stated that
he should not have put this entry in, because there was no
point in his talking to the press - which is what he would
be doing if his diaries came out - about that kind of a
conversation.

"Q:   How do you think the press might have reacted to that
kind of information about [S-2]?

A:   I think, as you'd read it, there's almost a lilt, a
kidding to it, and it is kidding.  And I meant it as that
way when I put it in.  This three times a week for seven
years, I mean, you ever talk about things not being true?
She never told me that she had been going with some guy
making love to him three times - what did I say - three
times a week for seven years.

Q:   It would appear that the kind of information you have
added here about [S-2] is of a similar kind to the
information about others which you might have deleted.

As   It was just dumb on my part.  I shouldn't have put it
in.  I meant it in a kidding fashion.  I did not mean it
here in a - I think you can tell from the way it's phrased.
I didn't mean it in a serious sense, but I still shouldn't
have put it in."

    Although Senator Packwood testified at his deposition
and later in his appearance before the Ethics Committee that
S-2 never told him "that she had been going with some guy
making love to him three times . . . a week for seven
years," there is in fact a lengthy entry in Senator
Packwood's diary for June 11, 1992, in which he recounts an
evening when he and S-2 went out for dinner, and after S-2
had quite a bit to drink, she told him about a man she had
been seeing for seven years, and making love with two or
three times a week, unbeknownst to Senator Packwood and the
others in his office.  Senator Packwood then kidded S-2 that
he and S-2 had made love six or seven times, because he felt
sorry for her, and out of a sense of  Christian duty, and it
turned out that she had been "banging" another man three
times a week for seven years.

    With respect to the second set of entries for this date,
Senator Packwood stated that in general, although 99 percent
of the "bulk" changes were done by Ms. Cormack, in this
particular case, he thought that he was responsible for the
deletion of the entry that appears on the audiotape, because
it involved S-1, who had been one of his favorite employees.
He thought that he probably substituted the material that
appears on the Cormack transcript, out of a compulsion to
fill in a big blank spot on the tape.

AUDIOTAPE

July 26, 1993

Talked with [name omitted].  God, was she pissy.  She's mad
about having to go through 300 pages of phone calls on the
campaign credit card to see who was called, and this is in
response to the request to a demand for all of the phone
calls that might have been made to any of the women involved
or to attempt to intimidate any of the women. God, I've not
seen her so pissed, not at me, just pissed generally.  <<And
she made the statement, I don't know why we're giving them
everything. My lawyer's not going to be as easy as yours.
Senator, you lust be assured that I'm going to cover - I'm
going to protect my interest in this. I said, that's fine.
God, as much as I love her, now that I know I'm not going to
be expelled or lose my seniority, I'd just as soon get this
over with.  She really has nothing she can say. In this
particular case, she sure could, on politics in the office,
but she was up to her neck in that also.  But in this,
there's nothing she can say, and if she were to try to rat
on me, it would probably end our relationship.  And if she
did try to rat, it would end our relationship, and perhaps
that would be just as well.  This is exacting a tremendous
toll.>>

CORMACK TRANSCRIPT

Talked with [name omitted] and she was really pissy.  She's
made [sic] about having to go through 300 pages of phone
calls on the campaign credit card to see who was called.
This is in response to the request from the Ethics
Committee.  She's not pissed at me.  Just pissed generally.
<<And she really has nothing to add. I think I've said this
before.  She knows almost nothing about any of the
incidents. I made the alleged phone calls trying to get
information about the women. I don't recall that I made any.
She really has nothing to fear.>>


    The deleted passage suggests that the person referred to
did not know a lot about the allegations of sexual
misconduct, but that if pressed, she would protect herself
(i.e., give up whatever information she did have) rather
than protect the Senator.  It also indicates that she knew a
lot about "politics in the office," that she herself was "up
to her neck," or heavily involved in using Senator
Packwood's office for political purposes, and that Senator
Packwood had some concern that she would try to "rat" on
him.  Instead, a passage has been substituted indicating
that she knew nothing that could implicate Senator Packwood
in either the issue of sexual misconduct, or the issue of
witness intimidation.

    Senator Packwood testified that the information that was
added to the Cormack transcript would have been done by him,
and not by Ms. Cormack.  He stated that the person referred
to in fact knew next to nothing, but he did not want the
press to see the part indicating that if she were to "rat,"
it would be the end of their relationship, and to speculate
about what it was that she knew.  He testified that he
substituted in its place a statement that was accurate.

    Senator Packwood was asked what he meant when he said in
the audiotape that the person referred to was up to her neck
in politics in the office.  He stated that he assumed that
it referred to research that his office did for his 1992
campaign, and that he might have had one or two people who
were doing a fair amount of research.  He did not recall who
those people were.

    Senator Packwood guessed that he changed this entry for
July 26, 1993 in early August of 1993, before he left for
recess.

<<. . . if they're not going to take hearsay, then they've
got to take only complaining witnesses.  And if they don't
have Judy Foster, and whatever that woman's name is, the
intern - I mean, ex-intern, she wasn't an intern - as
complaining witnesses, then I think there is nothing in this
decade of any consequence to be afraid of.>>

CORMACK TRANSCRIPT

<<There is no woman and never will be any woman for me like
[name omitted].  We argue, we bitch but the sheer wit, love,
humor, bonding I've never had with any man or woman like I
do with her.  All I really want, if I can, is to spend the
rest of my life taking care of her and loving her very
much.>>


     The deleted passage indicates that Senator Packwood was
aware that there were two women who were possible
complaining witnesses, whose complaints would have occurred
in the last ten years.  At this point, the Committee had not
notified Senator Packwood that Ms. Foster-Filppi was a
complainant, nor had her name appeared in the press.  This
entry indicates that Senator Packwood may have been
concerned that the Committee would uncover allegations by
Ms. Foster-Filppi and the "ex-intern," and that if the
Committee did not find them the only conduct he would have
to worry about would be conduct occurring more than ten
years ago. The substituted passage in the Cormack transcript
discusses an entirely different subject - it sets out his
reassurance of support to the woman referred to in the
entry.

    Senator Packwood testified that he assumed that he
substituted the information that appears on the Cormack
transcript, but not on the audiotape.  He stated that he
took out the entry about Ms. Foster-Filppi because the press
did not have her name, and obviously, he just filled in the
blank space on the tape.

August 7, 1993

Met Cath at Sutton Place to take a look at a unit that had
become available.  It's an end unit.  They're asking
230,000. The end unit, unfortunately, has an extra window
upstairs in what I will use as the study, which cuts down my
space a bit, but it's clean, it's ready to go.  I can use it
the way it is.  It has the large patio, and it has the large
patio with some sun on it, so I'm prepared to make an offer.

    <<I then asked Cath if I were to pay her a little extra,
would she be willing to take a week off and she and I would
simply go through the diary?  She said yes. In a week, with
Cathy typing, I think she could bring everything up to date,
and I could be going through it, the diary.  It will
actually be helpful.

     Came to the office. Dictated through Saturday, August 7
at 10:30.>>

Well, the only main difficulty we will have is I think the

related to the gathering of the information about the women
and did Ann Elias lie. Did I attempt to unjustifiably gather
information, et cetera.>>

     Dictated through 6:45, Saturday, August 7, just prior

CORMACK TRANSCRIPT

Met Cathy at Sutton Place to look at a place that had become
available.  It's an end unit.  It's clean, ready to go, has
the large patio with some sun on it, and I think I'm going
to make an offer.  <<I really am kind of looking forward to
settling in for these last five years and working hard in
the Senate and voting for what's good for America and
leaving a legacy that everyone can be proud of if I can get
this ethics matter behind me.>>

*  *  *  *

Well, the only main difficulty we will have is I think the
diary is going to be helpful. <<The only slight downside
will be a mixed bag on intimidation.  We never intended to
intimidate anyone. We never intended to make any information
public.  They'd already talked to the Post. How could we
intimidate them?>>

     Dictated through 6:45, Saturday, August 7, just before
getting together with [name omitted]. [name omitted] arrived
on time.


    The first deleted passage indicates that in early August
1993, shortly after receiving the Committee's second request
for documents (July 16, 1993), Senator Packwood was
reviewing his diary, and he concluded it would be helpful in
his defense.  In its place, a self-serving passage has been
added reflecting that Senator Packwood wants to work hard
for what is good for America.

    Senator Packwood testified that it appeared that he had
deleted the highlighted information in the first passage
from the audiotape, and substituted the information that
appears on the Cormack transcript.  He stated that Ms.
Cormack had told him that she could bring the diaries up to
date, but she did not have any of it done when he got back
from recess around Labor Day 1993. He took these entries out
so that she would not see them and think that he was mad at
her.

      Senator Packwood recalled asking Ms. Cormack on this
date if she could hurry up with the transcribing.  It was
probably at this time that he gave her six to eight
additional tapes, covering 1993 up to date, and including a
tape that ended immediately before the recess.  He could not
remember if he gave her these tapes on Saturday August 7, or
on Sunday; he had worked all night on them.  According to
the dates on the tapes themselves, the Senator would have
given her a tape covering up through August 5, 1993 before
leaving on August recess.

    The second deleted passage suggests that there are diary
entries relevant to the allegations of witness intimidation,
which was a subject of the Committee's inquiry, and also
suggests that there may have been some concern that Ann
Elias, who provided a statement about Julie Williamson which
Senator Packwood forwarded to the Washington Post, and who
had by this time testified before the Committee, had lied.
Ms. Elias stated in her deposition that Ms. Williamson came
to her house after Senator Packwood kissed her in his
office, and that she concluded that Ms. Williamson was
interested in having an affair with the Senator.  She also
told the Committee that Ms. Williamson did not tell her the
details about the Senator pulling her hair and grabbing her
girdle.  Her statement that went to the Washington Post
claimed that Ms. Williamson was interested in having an
affair with Senator Packwood, but did not include the fact
that Ms. Williamson had told her about the incident almost
immediately after it happened.

    There are in fact other diary entries that suggest that
Ms. Elias had misgivings about her statement - that she felt
torn between her loyalty to the Senator and her desire to
tell the truth - and that she was "buoyed up" by Jack Faust,
a friend of the Senator's, who convinced her that Ms.
Williamson had been telling her story on the "cocktail
circuit" for years, and that it had changed over the years
with the retelling.

    Senator Packwood testified that this was the kind of
deletion and addition he would have made as he was changing
his diary tapes, although he did not find much difference
between the two entries.  He was not sure that he deleted
the reference to Ms. Elias, and he stated that Ms. Cormack
may have taken out her name, as they were old friends, but
he thought that he had made the other changes.  He added the
information that appears in the Cormack transcript because
it was accurate information, and he thought that he would
put it in.

    Senator Packwood was asked if he had some concern in
August of 1993 about whether Ann Elias had lied.  He stated
that somebody in the press had claimed that Ms. Elias had
lied, but in fact, she had not.  He did not know what he
meant by this entry, but he knew that when he made the
original entry on the audiotape, he did not in fact think
that some of his diary entries might raise an issue as to
whether Ms. Elias had lied.

    This entry is for Saturday, August 7, 1993, the same day
that recess began.  Senator Packwood stated that it appeared
from his diary that he went to Oregon on the following
Monday.  He did not know when he dictated this entry, but
stated that it would have been after 1:30 p.m. on the
Saturday before he left, which is the time of this entry.
Senator Packwood was unsure about when he changed this
entry, but he testified that he did not make changes to the
tape that was in his machine when he left for recess until
he returned in September.  Given the fact that the tape that
covers this entry begins on August 6, 1993, it appears that
this entry was changed in September.

     At his June 1995 appearance before the Committee,
Senator Packwood was again asked about this entry:

"BY SENATOR SMITH:

Q:   ...Now instead of simply deleting that ("did Ann Elias
lie and did I attempt to unjustifiably gather
information...") but again, that would be, it appears to me,
would be something, if it is intimidation, it would be
something that the Committee would have an interest in.  But
you didn't simply delete it.  You changed it.  You added
considerably to it by making the point that we never
intended to intimidate anyone.  You went far beyond the
entry with the second entry.  My point is, let me just make
the point and then ask you to respond:  The passage that you
deleted suggests that there might be diary entries related
to the gathering of information about the women...And it
suggests further that there may have been concern that Elias
had perhaps not been truthful....And then in the entry that
you put in the Cormack transcript where the entry goes
beyond that to an absolute "We never intended to intimidate
anyone."  Whereas in one there is an implication and in the
second one you go beyond that.  You kill that completely by
saying you never intended to intimidate anyone.

A:   Well, you bet.  We didn't intend to intimidate anybody.
information...It was not to be part of the story but to
judge the evaluation of the people that had complained...
So, no, we didn't intend to intimidate, and that's why I put
it in this way.  If the press ever got this, I want them to
see that....

Q:   ...My question is, though:  Why use the diary--which
the diary should be basically an anecdotal record of what
transpired under a given period of time--why use a diary
entry to make that point?  I mean, you could have deleted
it.  If you had deleted the passage, there wouldn't have
been any reference to it, and you could have made a
statement to the press, couldn't you, that said I never
intended to intimidate anyone?  But you put it in the diary
in retrospect rather than--

 A:    Well we had said to the press on a number of
occasions that we did not intend to intimidate.  This wasn't
a new statement.  But you try to give this a preciseness
that simply, in retrospect, cannot be given to it...."


AUDIOTAPE

October 9, 1993

<<Stopped at Cathy's and gave her the tapes to transcribe. I
said Cathy, do you think you can do seven tapes by Tuesday
night?  She said she didn't think so. She said when you are
dictating, different machines, in airports, noise in the
background and sometimes you speak low because you don't
want people to hear, she said I know your voice as well as
anybody, and I know your inflection.  I could probably
transcribe this faster than anybody else can ever transcribe
it.  But she said an hour's dictation doesn't just take just
an hour's typing. you've got to go back and listen. She said
I'll be lucky to do four tapes by Tuesday night.>>

CORMACK TRANSCRIPT

<<Again, I went over to the condominium.  I am just excited
about seeing the
progress and getting into it. I'm just looking forward to
having a place of my own and playing with it and making it
the way I want it. It's Roy Prosterman and land reform. If
you own it you want to take care of it.>>


    The deleted passage indicates that a few days after his
deposition was interrupted and the Committee specifically
requested to see his diaries on October 6, 1993, Senator
Packwood delivered to Ms. Cormack the tapes, and asked her
to finish seven of them by the following Tuesday.  This
passage tends to indicate that Senator Packwood retrieved
his diary tapes from Ms. Cormack shortly after his
deposition was interrupted and the Committee specifically
asked to review his diaries, and that he returned them a few
days later, on October 9.

    Senator Packwood testified that he would not have seen
this entry until later in October 1993, when it came out of
Ms. Cormack's typewriter.  He thinks that he would have
taken the typed page back to Ms. Cormack and had her
substitute the new language, or he could have dictated
instructions to her on a tape, with yellow underlining on
the typed page.

    Senator Packwood stated that he would have wanted to
take out the information that appeared in the audiotape
because it was wrong.  He did not take her seven tapes on
this date; he only had a couple of tapes left, and one of
them may have been a half- tape.  He asked Ms. Cormack to do
seven tapes by Tuesday night, but he did not want the diary
to give the impression that he had taken seven tapes to her
on this date.

    Senator Packwood also guessed that the diary issue had
exploded in the press by this time.  Senator Packwood did
not want the press to know that there were diary tapes
because nobody, not even Ms. Cormack or his attorneys, knew
that there were tapes.  Senator Packwood later said that
neither his attorneys nor Ms. Cormack knew he kept backup
tapes, although obviously they knew that his diary was
transcribed from tapes. He simply did not want the press to
know about tapes, period.

    Senator Packwood testified that this entry would have
been transcribed by Ms. Cormack later in October, and he
felt that he had the right to take something out that was
wrong, when it was the first time he had seen the typed
transcript.  He did not believe that he was "forever
stopped" from changing anything he ever dictated again after
the deposition, and if he was seeing it for the first time,
he was free to change it.

    Senator Packwood could recall no particular reason that
he added the information that appears in the Cormack
transcript, but he stated that it was accurate.

<<Talked to Cath about 8:30. She'd left a message. She said
it had taken her about 11 hours to do a tape and a half. She
isn't even to the election yet. She says she got - she can
finish seven - seven tapes - by Tuesday night.  I told her
do those first three tapes as soon as she can and finish up
the other four as best she can.

    Dictated through Sunday morning at 10:00, at 9:20 a.m.>>

    I really didn't do much all day.  I went out to Radio
Shack, bought some things, went over and kind of looked at
the apartment.  I'm getting anxious to move in.  If there
was ever a day I just frittered away, and frittered it away
enjoyably, it was today.  I - paragraph.

    <<I stopped over at the [name omitted] just to chat.
They invited me to stay for dinner. but I really didn't want
to because I was going to go to bed early. [name omitted]
did give me four different frozen soups she had made, a corn
chowder, a turkey with rice, a black bean and something
else. So I took them home.>> Thawed out the corn chowder,
had it, and was in bed by 7:30.

     Dictated through Sunday night, October 10.

CORMACK TRANSCRIPT

Kind of a leisurely day.  I got up, read the Post
thoroughly.  Again, even though they attack me I find the
paper a good paper and one of the better papers in the
country.  Then I just went out for a walk, walked around the
Cathedral, went over to the condo - I'm so anxious to move
in.  If there was ever a day I just frittered away, this was
it.  Enjoyed it but frittered it away.

     Had some soup and went to bed.


    The deleted passage indicates that Senator Packwood was
pressing Ms. Cormack to finish seven of the diary tapes,
perhaps the tapes he had delivered to her the day before.
It also indicates that as of this date, Ms. Cormack had only
typed part of the 1992 tapes.  This is consistent with the
October 20, 1993 letter from Senator Packwood's attorneys to
the Committee, stating that Ms. Cormack had only finished
typing about half of the 1992 tapes by that point.  The
substituted passage is completely innocuous, and contains no
reference to the diaries.

    Senator Packwood testified that he did not specifically
recall deleting this entry, but he could have, because it
gives the impression he gave Ms. Cormack seven tapes the day
before, which is incorrect.  He stated that he took her one
or two tapes, the one that was in his machine when he gave
her tapes in August, and maybe one-half of another tape.

AUDIOTAPE

December 31, 1992

   The most important thing that happened was a phone call
from FS-1.  W-1, that Oregonian reporter, was calling her,
following up on some alleged violations of ethics in letters
that we sent out in 1984 and 1985.  He had heard from
sources that FS-1 had quit because she refused to type a
letter in the office on Senate equipment that was a
fund-raising letter, so she quit over it.  She blames Elaine
totally for it.  She doesn't blame me at all.  She said we
had done a mailing earlier in my travels to New England, but
she said those mailings of course were all right.  They were
in response to invitations that I had to speak, and we were
simply putting other functions together around them.  Well,
it's a good thing FS-1 doesn't know everything.

   W-1 wanted to know how many pieces were done, how many
man-hours did it take.  It was not franked mail, not Senate
stationery.  He asked her, "Did you get a ruling from the
Ethics Committee?"  She said, "No, Ethics might have said it
was okay."  He then said, "Well, FS-2 apparently quit over
the same thing, and, he says, "you and FS-2 quit at about
the same time."  FS-1 says, "No, we quit seven or eight
months apart."  He asked if FS-1 then went over to the
campaign.  She left in the summer of '84.  She said no, she
didn't go back to work until she went to work for in '85.

     Then FS-2 called FS-1.  FS-1 assumed that FS-2 had told
him all this, and FS-2 says no, he hadn't told him, that he
had all the details when he called FS-2 three weeks ago.
W-1 says the source was not a member of staff, and he has
called [name omitted], [name omitted], and he may try [name
omitted].  FS-1 said that no one would have known except
Elaine and FS-1, because they worked on this in private in
my office.  She said, however, [name omitted] would know,
because [name omitted] and FS-1 talked when I was visiting
in 1985, and FS-1 and sat in the outer office and she told
her the story.  This is eight years ago, so why did she
quit? [name omitted] knows, but FS-1-didn't tell her, so she
presumes [name omitted] did.

     W-1 asked if FS-1 knew [name omitted] FS-1 said only in
the sense that she had heard of her, in the way she has
heard of Jack Faust or Dave Barrows or [name omitted], as
she calls [name omitted].  FS-1 said she was quite critical
of the Oregonian for even thinking of doing a story like
this.  She said FS-2 was not going to allow his name to be
used or [name omitted] name to be used.  FS-1 asked for the
same privilege but W-1 refused. FS-1 said, "Elaine does
things the Senator doesn't know about, and the Senator
should not be blamed for things he didn't know about."  FS-1
again said that New England was okay.  It was not a fund-
raiser.

    <<He asked her who the mailings were being done for.
FS-1 said she couldn't remember, although he has called her
two or three times and she does remember it now it was [name
omitted], but she hasn't told him that.  Used his
letterhead.  There was no enclosure that went with it. W-1
asked about [name omitted] and some letter that included a
coin.  Well, of course that was the shekel letter, and that
was sent out by our direct mail house.

    FS-2 left six months or so after FS-1 left, allegedly
for the same reason, a different letter.  He said it was an
Israeli or a Jewish letter.>>  FS-1 said, I don't have a lot
of respect, in fact, I don't have any respect for Elaine,
but if you're going after Elaine, you should separate her
from Bob Packwood," she said.

CORMACK TRANSCRIPT

 But the most important thing that happened during the day
was that FS-1 called.  She said a reporter named W-1 of the
Oregonian had called her and he was on the trail of a story
about alleged violations of law or ethics or something -
some letters that had been sent out on official Senate
stationery or on Senate time or something like that - and
FS-1 quit.  And FS-1 said she blames Elaine.  <<PS-1 said,
"You know I don't like Elaine very well.">> She said the New
England letters we sent out were okay because we had been
invited to speak.  W-1 then wanted to know how many letters
or how many man hours. She said, she wasn't sure.  W- 1
asked if we'd gotten a ruling from the Ethics Committee.
FS-1 said she didn't know.  W-1 then asked if FS-2 didn't
quit about the same time.  FS-1 said no. He'd been there
seven or eight months and quit after FS-1 did.  FS-2 then
called FS-1 and FS-1 assumed FS-2 had told W-1 all of the
information  he had.  W-1 said no, that his source is not a
member of the staff.  That he has called [name omitted], he
has called [name omitted] and he may try [name omitted].
FS-1 said Elaine might honestly think (inaudible) fired FS-1
for another reason because Elaine and FS-1 weren't getting
along at all at this time.  But FS-1 said, "[name omitted]
knew because when I was visiting [name omitted] in 1985 she
had told about it and FS-1 knows that knows but FS-1 didn't
tell [name omitted] so FS-1 presumes did.  W-1 asked if she
knew [name omitted] and she doesn't.  FS-1 told W-1 she was
mad at the Oregonian for doing the story and she did not
want her name used under any circumstances.  FS-1 then told
me she had utterly no respect for Elaine and <<she said,
"Senator. I don't want to do anything to harm you but I
don't like Elaine.">>


    These entries discuss charges that appeared in the press
in late 1992, to the effect that two staffers had quit
Senator Packwood's office after being forced to do campaign
work on Senate time.  On March 25, 1993, the Committee asked
Senator Packwood to respond to these published allegations.
The sentences added to the Cormack transcript, to the effect
that one of the staffers making these charges did not like
Elaine Franklin, Senator Packwood's chief of staff, could be
viewed as an attempt to ascribe a motive to the complaint
being made by this staffer - the desire to "get  the chief
of staff.

    The deleted passages also indicate that there may in
fact have been a campaign related mailing that was done from
Senator Packwood's Senate office.

    Senator Packwood's response appears after the next diary
excerpt.

FS-1 says, "My quotes are positive to you, and if you let me
use them, it would put you in a good light." I said, "FS-1,
we're better off to have no quotes attributed to anybody.
That's the only safe way to do anything." Well, W- 1 called
her back, said he had talked to his editor and it's okay to
use FS-1's name because the name had come from third party
sources, but he would be willing to say that she refused any
comment.  She wanted to know what to do, and I said, "When
he calls back, tell him you don't want your name used under
any circumstances." <<I said, "FS- 1, this is not going to
help you.  You will be regarded as a danger to employ."  She
says, "I know." I said, "What you should have said from the
start is, I don't want to talk with you
about this, and hung up .">>

*  *  *  *

     <<W-1 thinks that Elaine has stepped over the ethical
and legal line many times, but he's having a hard time
getting sources.  He asked about Elaine's travel expenses.
FS-1 said, "They're all legitimate. I used to do her travel
expenses."  he asked about what hotel did we stay at at
Dorchester.  He wanted to know what hotel we stayed at at
Bandon. He said "In reviewing the reimbursements, it seems
the Senator spends a lot of time in Coos Bay." At least
that's the way FS-1 interpreted it. FS-1 thought he meant a
trip. I said, "Did he mean when you were there or does he
mean currently?"  FS-1 says, "Well, I'm not sure." Of
course, what he could be thinking is, Elaine spends a lot of
time in  Coos Bay.  FS-1 said she didn't get along with
[name omitted], and she told W-1 to call [name omitted], in
the hope that [name omitted] might say FS-1 is wacko.  She
did get along with [name omitted].>>

  7:30, Elaine called.  I filled her in on the entire
situation for about 10 minutes.  She called me back 10
minutes later.  In the interim W-1, W-1, had called Julia
wanting a statement, and Julia had called Elaine to find out
what to say.  Elaine wants me to find out if FS-1 confirmed
that was the reason that she quit.  I called FS-1 and she
said yes, she confirmed that was the reason.

    Dictated through 10 minutes to 8 o'clock, Friday night,
January 1st, after talking with FS-1, confirming the reason
she quit, but before I got back to Elaine.

     Eight o'clock, I got back to Elaine, told her that FS-1
confirmed that she had quit because of the demand that she
do the letters. <<I said. "You've got two choices. Elaine.
You can stonewall this and saY these letters - this never
happened, or you can say FS-1 was fired because she wouldn't
do other work. or however you want to handle it.">>

    Dictated through 8:15, Friday, January 1st, after
telling Elaine that FS-1 had confirmed that she had quit
because she was ordered to do the political letter, but
before Elaine had called W-1.

CORMACK TRANSCRIPT

 FS-1 says, "My quotes are positive to you and if you let me
use them it would put you in a good light.  I said, "FS- 1,
I'd rather not be in any light - good or bad.  I'm tired of
being in the light.' Well, W-1 called her back and said he
had talked to his editor and said it's okay to use her name
because her name had come from a third party source, but he
would be willing to say that she refused any comment.   She
wanted to know what to do. <<I said. "FS-1, you said you
wanted to help me but you don't mind getting Elaine. Please
realize that anything you say to 'get Elaine' hurts me,
professionally and personally.">>


I called Elaine and filled her in on all of this.  She
called me back ten minutes later.  In the interim W-1 had
called Julia wanting a statement and Julia had called Elaine
to find out: what to say.  Elaine wants me to find out if
FS-1 confirmed that was the reason she quit. I called FS-1
and she said, "yes."

    Got back to Elaine and told her that FS-1 claimed that
she had quit because of the demand she do the letters.
<<Elaine said, "Didn't she do political letters in 1980?"  I
said, "I assume so because she was my personal secretary all
during that campaign."  Elaine said. "Did she ever complain
about doing political letters?"  I said. "No.">>

     Dictated through Friday, January 1, at 8:15 p.m.


       The passages substituted on the Cormack transcript
again portray the former staffer's motive in making the
charges as desire to "get' Elaine Franklin, Senator
Packwood's chief of staff.  The substituted passages
reinforce this theme, by suggesting that the former staffer
had done political letters before without complaining.

    The deleted passages also indicate that there may be
some validity to the former staffer's claims, and that
Senator Packwood advised Ms. Franklin either to "stonewall"
the claims, or to state that the former staffer was fired
for other reasons.

    Senator Packwood testified that he made the original
entries to his diary audiotape at the same time that he was
reviewing his diary tapes to find entries for his attorneys
regarding the intimidation issue, during the end of December
1992 and early January 1993.  While he was reviewing hiE
tapes for his attorneys, the former staffer called him, and
told him that the Oregonian had called her about the story.
He had several conversations with her about it, and also
with Ms. Franklin.

    The Senator testified that at the time, he was being
beaten by the press, and he was very concerned that this
would result in another story.  Senator Packwood provided
several versions of how and when he changed these entries.
He first testified that when he gave Ms. Cormack the tapes
to use in transcribing excerpts from the fall of 1992 for
his attorneys, he may have also asked her to transcribe
these entries, during the Christmas recess.

    Senator Packwood then testified that he thought he
transcribed these entries himself during the Christmas
recess, using his secretary's transcribing machine, because
he wanted to see them in print.  He then stated that he
could not remember whether he transcribed the entries, or
whether he asked Ms. Cormack to do so.

    Senator Packwood further testified that he was not sure
if he made the changes to these entries on the tape around
the time of the Christmas break in 1992.  He could not
remember if he gave Ms. Cormack these entries to type,
indicating which parts of the tape she was to type, or
whether he ran these two days onto a separate tape and gave
it to Ms. Cormack to transcribe, or whether he simply
redictated the whole thing.  Although he had earlier
testified that he made the changes to these entries before
he went back to Oregon and had the! terrible experience with
the press in January 1993, he later stated that he was not
sure of that, and he probably would not have made the
changes until he finished the tape that was in his machine.
He then stated that he listened to this tape some!time when
he was finished listening to the 1992 tapes, but that he did
not wait until he was finished changing the 1992 tapes to
change this one.

    Senator Packwood then said again that at the same time
he gave Ms. Cormack the tapes containing the! fall 1992
excerpts, even before he was done dictating on this
particular tape, he either gave her this entry to
transcribe, or he looked at and redictated it, although he
did not necessarily remember redictating it right then.

    Senator Packwood testified that he made the bulk of the
changes to these entries.  They were unusual, because he
wanted to see them in "whole cloth" first as to what the
former staffer had said, and what Ms. Franklin had said
about the story.

    Senator Packwood testified that Ms. Cormack could have
left portions of these entries out when she was
transcribing, and that he did not want to say that he did it
all.[fn 156]

      Senator Packwood also testified that these
conversations with his former staffer, and the fact that the
press was involved, caused him to start changing his 1992
diary tapes.

    Senator Packwood testified that he did not know why he
deleted the information from the audiotape, or why he
substituted the entries to the Cormack transcript.  There
was no logic to the things that were left in and the things
that were taken out.  He stated that his mental state of
mind in that period was just not rational, and he could not
give a rational answer as to why he put things in and left
things out.

    Senator Packwood was asked why he added the three
entries indicating that the former staffer did not like Ms.
Franklin.  He stated that the former staffer in fact hated
Ms. Franklin and had told him this in telephone
conversations around the time of the changes.

    Senator Packwood could not recall advising Ms. Franklin
either to stonewall this issue, or to say that the former
staffer was fired for other reasons, as indicated in the
entry on the audiotape.  He was questioned as follows:

"Q:   Do you have any reason to believe this diary entry
didn't reflect what you said to [chief of staff]?

A:   I'm not going to get into this discussion about
accuracy.  I don't know.  You're asking me when you dictate
on the fly, when you dictate when you're tired, do you
accurately reflect things?  You may or may not.  You may
totally miss the accuracy, I don't know."

Went to dinner with Elaine at Mrs. Simpson's.  She was very
down but she was able to laugh.  She is so incensed about
the FS-2 and FS-1 charges that she lost her focus.  Of
course, these relate to her, and she wants to clear her
name.  She says, you're going to be all right, but I'm not
employable.  I said, you're employable with me.  She goes,
"Oh, God." I can see where the Oregonian is going next.
They're going to try to prove we did all kinds of politics
in the office.  I had talked with Lynn, and she said, we
didn't do any political fundraising in the office.  We did
some thank-you letters, and they fell into two categories.
One, we thank everybody who perhaps came to one of the PAC
fundraisers, and then we do an occasional letter if somebody
sent money directly to the office, <<but that what we did an
immense amount of, was memos to the staff on research in the
office about [name omitted] voting record and issues I
needed in my debates forum and what not. No question about
that.>>

CORMACK TRANSCRIPT

Went to dinner with Elaine at Mrs. Simpson's.  She was so
down she was unable to laugh. She is so incensed about the
FS-2 and FS-1 charges that she's lost her focus.  Of course
these relate to her and she wants to clear her name. She
says, "You're going to be all right but I'm not employable."
I said, "You're employable with me."  She goes, "Oh God."  I
can see where the Oregonian is going next.  They're going to
try to prove we did all kinds of politics in the office.  I
talked with Lynn and she said we were very careful about not
sending out any fundraising letters from the office.
<<Anything she did she did on her time.>>  She said she did
some minor thank-yous if somebody actually sent money to the
office and she may have thanked people who came to special
events <<but she did them on her time.  She said we were
especially careful because we'd been warned by the Ethics
Committee and [Former Ethics Committee Staff Director] to
avoid office involvement.>>


    The deleted passages, entered in his diary at the time
that the Oregonian was looking into charges that former
staffers left his office after being forced to do campaign
work on Senate time, indicate that Senator Packwood in fact
did an immense amount  of political work in his Senate
office, in the form of memos and research about his
opponent's voting record, and issues for debate.  The
substituted passages instead disclaim any involvement by
anyone in his Senate office in political work, and portray
his staff as being very careful to avoid such activity.

    Senator Packwood testified that he thought he was
responsible for the changes from the audiotape to the
Cormack transcript; he could not imagine Ms. Cormack adding
the material that appears in the Cormack transcript.[fn 157]
He stated that he would have made these changes in January,
February, March, or April 1993, before he finished making
changes to the 1992 tapes.

    Senator Packwood stated that he probably would have
added the language to the Cormack transcript to emphasize,
if it got out in the press, that they were not heavily
involved in politics in the office.  And in fact, the former
Ethics Committee Staff Director had come to his office to
advise him.  He would have deleted the corresponding entry
in the ,audiotape because he would not want the press to see
it.

    He stated that he did not know, as it says in his diary,
if they did an "immense" amount of research in the office
about his opponent's voting record.  They did some research,
but  immense may be an overstatement.  The Senator testified
as follows:

"Q:   Why would that be of concern to you?

A:   Probably because we were doing politics in the office.

Q:   Did you understand that that was permitted or not
permitted?

A:   I knew that we were not supposed to use the office - we
used to think of it fundraising, not so much research, and
that we tried to keep pretty clear of the office except for
the occasional letters that you see [staffer] did.  But most
of it of our mail, most of our fundraising was outside the
office, but the memos and research we probably did.

Q:   Senator, I think you just indicated that you did do a
good bit, maybe immense isn't the right word but you did a
good bit of politics in the office.

A:   Well, I think "research" is the correct term.

Q:   Political research?

A:   No.  More voting research.

Q:   Why would you need [opponent's] voting record and
issues for any purpose other than in connection with your
campaign?

A:   Well, I said that.

Q:   So it was in connection with your campaign that that
information that research was being done?

A:   We were hoping that he wasn't going to be our opponent
but if he was, that was the purpose of."

     Senator Packwood could not recall who in his office was
doing the voting research, but he stated that his personal
secretary would have typed any memos he did for his opponent
research books.

I introduced [Senator X], who was the speaker that night,
and he was excellent.  No notes.  Good humor.  <<He says,
you know, the Republicans have got a nutrition program. It's
help you get a job and have money in your pocket so you can
go to the grocery store and buy food.  That is our nutrition
Program.>>  He finished, [name omitted] and I and Elaine and
[Senator X] - [name omitted] - and the guy travelling with
[Senator X], met for just 10 or 15 minutes. <<[Senator X]
again promised $100,000 for Party-building activities.  And
what was said in that room would be enough to convict us all
of something.  He says, now, of course you know there can't
be any legal connection between this money and Senator
Packwood. but we know that it will be used for his benefit.
[name omitted] said. oh, yes. God. there's Elaine and I
sitting there.  I think that's a felony. I'm not sure.  This
is an area of the law I don't want to know.>>  [Senator X]
left.  Elaine and I headed back to the motel.

CORMACK TRANSCRIPT

I introduced [senator X] who was the speaker that night and
he was excellent.  No notes. Good humor.  He finished and
[name omitted] and I and Elaine and [Senator X] - [name
omitted] - and the guy traveling with [Senator X] met for
just ten or fifteen minutes.  <<There was the usual argument
- I suppose a more polite word for it would be discussion -
of how much money the National Committee or Senatorial
Committee or anY committee was going to give the state
party. I remember those arguments all mY life. When I was
county chairman it was how much was the state going to give
the county.  The lesser unit always wants the greater unit
to give them money of some kind.  Well, anyway. the
discussion ended in a draw.>> [Senator X] left and Elaine
and I headed back to the motel.


    The deleted passage indicates that ,another Senator,
with Senator Packwood's knowledge, had agreed to direct
$100,000 from a Republican Party Committee to be used to
benefit Senator Packwood's campaign, and had discussed this
with Senator Packwood in a meeting with Elaine Franklin and
another person.  This entry raises questions about the
possible violation of campaign finance laws.  Substituted in
its place is an innocuous passage discussing campaign
funding.

    Senator Packwood testified that he deleted the
information from the audiotape, and substituted the
information that appears on the Cormack transcript.  He
stated that the entry on the audiotape was an instance where
he did not want to embarrass a fellow Senator, and in fact
the entry was wrong:

"This is no crime.  Party building activities are perfectly
legal and the Senatorial committee gives money to the party
if the party puts up money for the Senate candidate.  It
cannot just be a passthrough where they give them 100 and
they pass it on."

    When he realized that the entry was wrong, Senator
Packwood decided that it was not something he would want out
in the press. He testified that he substituted the material
that appears on the Cormack transcript just to fill up the
tape.

    Senator Packwood testified that the part of the diary
entry reading "But he says now of course there can't be any
legal connection between this money and Senator Packwood" is
an example of a conversation that never occurred, because
the other Senator would not have said that.  Those were his
[Senator Packwood's] words attributed to the other Senator,
and they did not even reflect the essence of something that
the other Senator said to him.

    Senator Packwood testified that the meeting reflected in
this entry actually took place.  But beyond that, he stated
that the entry was simply wrong.  He testified that the
conversation in fact reflected nothing that was illegal,
that the entry was in jest, and that nobody in Senator X's
position would take that kind of a risk.

now reserved an auditorium in June in Salem to put an
independent on the ballot, but I am confident with [name
omitted] I can beat [name omitted] and the OCA.
Nevertheless, they've reserved an auditorium in Salem.>>

CORMACK TRANSCRIPT

<<We talked about independent expenditures.  I said I didn't
want to know about that and none of us were to know about
that.  We want independent expenditures to be truly
independent. Those who are going to support us will support
us.  Those who won't won't.  Let's let the chips fall where
they may.>>


     The deleted entries suggest that Senator Packwood knew
about possible "independent expenditures" by the Automobile
Dealers and possibly Tim Lee, a former staffer, on his
behalf, and that he intended to destroy any evidence of a
link to the individual who would make the expenditures for
the Auto Dealers.  This entry raises possible questions
about campaign finance improprieties.

    The substituted entry is a self-serving passage
portraying Senator Packwood as having no knowledge of any
independent expenditures made on his behalf, and being above
any involvement with or knowledge of any such expenditures.

    Senator Packwood testified that he suspected that Ms.
Cormack left out the first entry on this date, although he
was not sure.[fn 158]  He thought that he would have taken
out the paragraph about the coalition.  He was sure that he
deleted the paragraph about the OCA, as the OCA had been a
major problem for him in his campaign.  He stated that he
had been terribly afraid that the OCA was going to put a
candidate! on the ballot against him in the 1992 election.
The OCA also had a measure on the ballot on anti-gay rights
that was the hottest issue he had ever seen on the Oregon
ballot, and which was heavily editorialized by the
Oregonian.  He was not on their side on this issue, or the
abortion issue or the compulsory school prayer issue, and
the OCA was going to try to take a shot at him.  His
campaign did everything they could do to prevent this.

    Senator Packwood's opponent in the 1992 election accused
him of making deals with the OCA, and the press questioned
him repeatedly about this.  He did not want to have anything
in his diaries about the OCA.  Senator Packwood agreed that
there was not anything in this particular entry that would
offend the OCA, but he stated that he had attempted to take
out anything he could find about the OCA.

    Senator Packwood was asked why he was concerned about
the entries referring to the OCA when at the time that he
took them out, in the spring of 1993, the election was over.
He stated that at the time, he was beset by the press, which
was looking for everything they could find about him from
the time the story came out in the Washington Post about the
allegations of sexual misconduct.  He did not want the press
re!living the election. The press was excoriating him, and
he did, not want to give them this information.

    Senator Packwood stated that there was no particular
reason that he substituted the information in the Cormack
transcript about independent expenditures, other than that
they may have been talking about it at the time.  The
subject was on his mind the same day that he was changing
his tapes, and he wanted to fill the space on the tape.[fn
159]

    Senator Packwood testified that the industry group in
general did not do any independent expenditures against his
opponent.  This particular group did not do anything for or
against Senator Packwood, or for or against his opponent.
He did not recall this conversation with Elaine Franklin
about independent expenditures, or any conversation about
the individual who was to make the expenditures and the
industry group, or about Tim Lee and independent
expenditures.

    Senator Packwood was asked what he meant by the
reference to destroying evidence connecting them to the
individual who was to make the expenditures, or to
independent expenditures.  He stated that if one were going
to have coordinated independent expenditures, which is
wrong, one would not want any evidence of association with
anyone connected to the group that was doing independent
expenditures.  But they did not do any coordination of
independent expenditures.  They never had any evidence about
the individual named and any potential independent
expenditures, nor did they destroy any evidence related to
this individual.


AUDIOTAPE

October 6. 1992

Came back to the office and met with [name omitted] from the
National Rifle Association at three o'clock.  <<He showed me
the piece the National Rifle Association is going to send
out hitting [name omitted].  God, it is tough! It starts
right out: vote to toss out [name omitted] and vote for
Senator Bob Packwood. Toss out of Congress someone who
believes he made a mistake when he supported your Second
Amendment Right. Vote to toss out [name omitted].

    Then they quote when [name omitted] said Congressmen who
were supported by the NRA were patsies.  Or, if you had an
endorsement by the NRA you were in an ideological
straitjacket.

     Then, the article in The Washington Post:  Confessions
of a Former NRA Supporter.

     I cannot tell you how tough it is. They are going to
send it to 90,000 members. And, if he has enough money he's
going to send it out to 100,000 Oregon gun owners, or
something like that. Now the question is: Are they going to
do a second mailing just before the postcard about "get out
and vote."

     God, things are going in the right direction today.
It's a month to go and there are going to be ups and downs.
but we're here today.

     Dictated through Tuesday. October 6th at four o'clock.
And here. Cathy, I'm going to end.

CORMACK TRANSCRIPT

Came back to the office and met with [name omitted] of the
NRA.  <<I kind of like the guy but he is a bit of a braggart
about how many races he sees the NRA winning and how solid
is going to be the NRA's control in the House.  He didn't
talk so much about the Senate. He may be right by my
intuition tells me the tide is turning against the NRA. With
more and more crime I think you're going to see a situation
where People will think gun registration is the answer.  It
isn't going to solve these problems.  And I'm not sure what
will but I don't think we want to try to take guns away from
people.  I think the second amendment defends that right.
I'm happy to hear [name omitted] out and I'm happy to hear
of his plans for the House races and I assume they will
support me although they haven't said that for sure.


     Again, the deleted passages indicate that Senator
Packwood was meeting with the NRA and reviewing their
efforts against his opponent.  In the substituted passage,
Senator Packwood distances himself from the NRA and their
goals, and does not mention that he was counting on the
NRA's support.

    Senator Packwood testified that he was probably
responsible for deleting the information from the audiotape
and substituting the information that appears in the Cormack
transcript, because he did not want the press to know about
his negotiations with the NRA, and that he was talking with
the NRA about the mailing they were going to send to their
members.  The entry that was substituted, which he says is
accurate, was put in to fill the space, although it
obviously would not fill the whole blank space left by the
deletion.

    Senator Packwood assumed that the meeting with the
individual from the NRA actually took place, although he did
not recall it.  He could think of no reason why he would
have recorded such a detailed summary of the meeting if it
actually had not taken place.


      c.   Entries Referring to Senator Packwood's
Negotiations with the Oregon Citizens Alliance During his
1992 Campaign

    Senator Packwood testified that he deleted every
reference to the Oregon Citizens Alliance which he could
find, because this would be an explosive subject in Oregon.
At least five such entries were deleted.

    During his 1992 campaign, Senator Packwood was accused
by the media of making a deal with the Oregon Citizens
Alliance (OCA), a conservative group, that they would not
run a candidate against him in return for certain promises.
Senator Packwood consistently denied these accusations.
Senator Packwood's diary tapes for 1992 and 1993 contain a
number of entries discussing what could be characterized as
negotiations with the OCA by others on Senator Packwood's
behalf.  These entries do not appear on the Cormack
transcript, and in some cases, entries have been added that
deny any deal was ever made! with the OCA.

    Senator Packwood testified that there never was a 'deal'
with the OCA, and that he added information to the Cormack
transcript to emphasize that for the benefit of the press.


        d.   Entries Referring to Contacts with Committee
Members by Senator Packwood During the Committee's Inquiry

     There are a number of entries on the 1992 audiotapes,
which do not appear on the Cormack transcript, referring to
conversations by Senator Packwood with members of the
Committee concerning the Committee's inquiry.

    Senator Packwood testified that he deleted these entries
from his diary tapes because he was afraid that if the press
obtained them, they would suggest a "Republican conspiracy"
in connection with the Committee's inquiry.


        e.   Entries About Senator Packwood Accepting
Contributions to his Legal Defense Fund from Lobbyists

    There are several entries in the 1993 diary tapes
related to Senator Packwood's acceptance or solicitation of
contributions to his legal defense fund from lobbyists
visiting his Senate office. At least one of these entries
gives the impression that a group contributed to his legal
defense fund in order to get or stay in his good graces.

    Senator Packwood stated that he attempted to remove any
references to contributions to his legal defense fund by
lobbyists, because the press would attempt to make corrupt,
illegal, and immoral inferences from them about the way
politics work.  He stated that it is perfectly legal,
ethical, and moral for a group, even one that has opposed
you in the past, to come in and make a contribution.

    Senator Packwood denied any improper linkage between his
acceptance of contributions to his legal defense fund and
the conduct of his official Senate duties.

        5. Findings

           a. Reliability of the Diaries

      Senate Ethics Counsel finds that from 1969 through
1993, Senator Packwood kept detailed daily diaries. More
specifically, for the diaries covering the period from
January 1, 1989 through November 21, 1993, Senator Packwood
recorded, often in minute detail, events in his professional
and personal life, as well as his thoughts and feelings on a
wide range of subjects, covering both his professional and
personal life. Counsel finds that despite Senator Packwood's
protestations about the unreliability of his diaries, these
diaries were in fact an attempt by Senator Packwood to
accurately record, from his perspective, events which he
witnessed or in which he participated, and his thoughts and
feelings about a variety of subjects.

      While, as Senator Packwood points out, his
recollection or assessment of events at the time may in some
instances turn out to be inaccurate, or differ from the
recollection of others, that does not mean that Senator
Packwood did not set out to record events and perceptions as
accurately as he could. Counsel finds that while Senator
Packwood's diaries may not always be complete or accurate in
every respect as a historical account of events, they are
certainly accurate as a contemporaneous reflection of his
perception of events, and his thoughts and feelings about a
broad array of subjects.

      Counsel notes that Senator Packwood made arrangements
to leave his diaries to a historical trust. This fact,
together with the sheer comprehensive nature of the diary
entries, which record everything from Presidential briefings
to the most mundane details of Senator Packwood's personal
habits, is powerful evidence that Senator Packwood himself
intended his diaries to be an accurate contemporaneous
reflection of his perception of events, professional and
personal, and his contemporaneous thoughts and feelings on
many subjects.

      Senate Ethics Counsel concludes that this
contemporaneous record created by Senator Packwood is in
fact reliable evidence of the events that it memorializes,
as perceived by Senator Packwood at the time he recorded
them, and of his contemporaneous thoughts and feelings.


        b. Alteration of the Diaries

      Senate Ethics Counsel finds that as of December 1, 199
2, Senator Packwood was on notice that he was the subject of
the Committee's inquiry into allegations of misconduct.
After that time, Senator Packwood had an obligation of trust
to the Senate, irrespective of any legal obligation which
might attach, not to alter or destroy any documents or
evidence in his possession or control that could be relevant
to the subject of the Committee's inquiry.

      There is no dispute that substantial portions of the
entries for Senator Packwood's 1992 and 1993 diaries did not
make it from the original contemporaneous audiotape onto the
transcripts typed by Cathy Cormack. Although a large number
of these entries appear to have been skipped over,
paraphrased, or otherwise changed by Ms. Cormack in her rush
to complete the diaries in the late summer and early fall of
1993, Senator Packwood himself testified that he deleted
from his audiotapes most of the entries where corresponding
entries were substituted on the typed transcript.[fn 160]
Many of the entries falling into this category dealt with
matters that were directly related to the Committee's
inquiry or that raised questions about possible misconduct
falling under the Committee's jurisdiction.  Senate Ethics
Counsel finds that Senator Packwood intentionally altered
many of the diary passages that related to the Committee's
inquiry or raised questions about possible misconduct within
the Committee's jurisdiction, and that he did so after he
was on notice that he was the subject of the Committee's
inquiry.


       c.   Senator Packwood's Motivation for Making Changes
to His Diary

    Senator Packwood has testified that he took out entries
from his 1992 and 1993 diary tapes because he feared that
once they went to his attorneys, they would be leaked to the
press.  He testified that he did not act out of a desire to
keep the deleted entries from the Committee, but that his
sole motivation was to prevent entries that could be
embarrassing to himself or others from getting to the press
through his attorneys.  Several factors should be considered
in evaluating this testimony.

    First, if Senator Packwood were truly concerned about
embarrassing entries in his diaries leaking to the press, he
could simply have deleted those entries.  There was no need
to substitute passages in their place, passages that were
often self-serving or exculpatory.  Indeed, in one instance,
while he deleted a passage that would be highly embarrassing
to himself and others if it became public, he substituted in
its place an entry that would have been equally embarrassing
to another staff member if it had become public.  He offered
no explanation for his substitution of entries, other than
that it was the result of his compulsive habit of dictating.

    The nature of the entries that Senator Packwood took out
of his diary is also a strong indication that his motivation
may not have been simply to keep entries from leaking to the
press.  A good number of these entries relate specifically
to the subject of the Committee's inquiry - either the women
involved, the issue of intimidation, or the progress of the
Committee's inquiry. Indeed, Senator Packwood changed
entries which related to the subject of intimidation of
witnesses well after his own attorneys had instructed him to
collect and forward entries related to the intimidation
issue.  Many of the remaining entries that were changed
raise questions about other possible misconduct by Senator
Packwood that would be subject to the Committee's
jurisdiction.  The nature of the entries deleted points to
the conclusion that Senator Packwood set out to delete not
only those possibly incriminating entries relating to the
Committee's inquiry, but any entries that might trigger
further inquiry by the Committee into other areas of
possible misconduct.[fn 161]

      Further, Senator Packwood made no changes to his
already- transcribed pre-1992 diaries, as he did to his
untranscribed 1992-1993 tapes.  This contrast in treatment
between the pre-1992 diaries and the 1992-93 tapes is
underscored by the fact that Senator Packwood deleted
several passages in his 1993 diary tapes referring to his
consensual relationship with a staffer, (S- l),and his
concern that she might be trying to "build a case" against
him.  Yet he did not delete an entry in November 1989 which
describes in explicit detail how he and the staffer had sex
on his office floor, although the deleted entries make it
clear that he knew when this incident took place.

    Additionally, Senator Packwood stated that he was
concerned that his diaries would be leaked once he turned
them over to his attorneys.  Yet the evidence indicates that
with the exception of the October-November excerpts from
1992 dealing with the intimidation issue, his attorneys
never asked him to turn over any significant portion of his
diaries to them in toto, although he did provide them with
selected entries from his diary during the course of
1993.[fn 162] Indeed, his attorneys did not receive any of
the diary, other than the selected excerpts that Senator
Packwood provided to them, until after his deposition was
interrupted in October 1993 when the Committee requested the
diaries.  At that time, they first received the diary
transcript covering the years 1969 through 1991, followed by
1992-1993 transcripts as Ms. Cormack typed them.

    Senator Packwood has emphasized to the Committee that he
did not destroy the original audiotapes, and that if the
Committee had gotten up to 1992 and 1993 in its original
review of the diaries, he would have informed the Committee
of the changes.  He overlooks the fact that at the same time
that Committee Counsel was reviewing the earlier years of
the diary in October 1993, he was permitting Ms. Cormack to
type transcripts for 1992 and 1993 from the altered
audiotape, and was turning over to his attorneys transcripts
prepared from these altered tapes.  At that time, Senator
Packwood knew that the Committee wanted to review his
diaries through 1993.  And even after he received the
Committee's subpoena asking for diaries and tapes, he
continued to have Ms. Cormack type from the altered
audiotapes, which transcripts he provided to his attorneys.

    Had he intended for the Committee to review a transcript
prepared from the original, unchanged diary tapes, he would
not have had Ms. Cormack typing from the altered audiotapes.
It is also significant that Senator Packwood did not tell
his own attorneys that the transcripts Ms. Cormack was
typing, and that he was providing to them during this period
after October 6, 1993, had been altered.  Indeed, even as
late as October 20, 1993, Senator Packwood remained silent
as his attorneys informed the Committee that some of the
transcripts for 1992, which unbeknownst to them had been
typed from the altered tapes, would soon be available for
review by the Committee.[fn 163]

      Senator Packwood has also emphasized that the
Committee received the original audiotapes, and thus was not
misled.  It is true that, after a lengthy court battle, the
Committee received the original audiotapes.  The issue,
however, is not whether the Committee eventually received
evidence to which it was lawfully entitled,[fn 164] but
whether Senator Packwood intentionally created a second
version of that evidence after he knew or should have known
the Committee wanted it, and whether as part of that process
he destroyed evidence.  Any improper conduct occurred when
Senator Packwood made the changes to his diaries or
destroyed evidence as part of that process, regardless of
whether the Committee eventually received the authentic
version, or regardless of whether the Committee avoided the
possibility of being actually misled, because it
successfully obtained the originals.


       d.   The Timing of the Changes

    For the purpose of determining whether Senator Packwood
engaged in improper conduct, it is not necessary to make a
specific finding regarding the timing of his changes to the
diary.  The timing of the changes, however, may reflect
Senator Packwood's state of mind in making the changes.

    The Committee's inquiry into allegations of sexual
misconduct began December 1, 1992.  On February 4, 1993 the
inquiry was expanded to include possible witness
intimidation. Thereafter, on March 29, and July 16, 1993 the
Committee sent document requests to Senator Packwood
requesting information and documents concerning these
allegations.  The information sought by these requests
included information such as that contained in some of the
diary entries altered by the Senator.  Senator Packwood has
testified that he began changing his 1992 audiotapes
beginning in January 1993 and continuing through April 1993,
and that later, in late July or early August 1993, he began
changing his 1993 audiotapes.  Thus, even if one accepts his
testimony as to the timing of the changes, Senator Packwood
was intentionally altering materials related to the
Committee's inquiry after he knew or should have known that
the Committee had sought or would likely seek these
materials.

    Thereafter, on October 6, 1993 at the interruption of
his deposition the Committee requested specific periods in
their entirety from his diary dating from 1969, specifically
including the period from August 1989 thru October 6, 1993.

    Senator Packwood has testified that he made most of the
changes, with a few exceptions, in the first seven months of
1993, well before his deposition was interrupted in October
1993 and the Committee specifically requested his diaries.
Senator Packwood's testimony in this regard must, however,
be evaluated in the context of other evidence.

     If the diary changes were made after the interruption
of Senator Packwood's deposition on October 6, 1993, this
could account for the fact that Senator Packwood only made
changes on the untranscribed tapes for the years 1992 and
1993: once the Committee asked for the diaries, and Senator
Packwood turned over the already typed transcripts through
1991 to his attorneys, he could not make any changes to
those entries.  But he still had the audiotapes for 1992 and
1993, most of which had not yet been transcribed.

      Senator Packwood testified that he felt compelled to
fill up the space left on an audiotape after deleting
passages.  However, an alternative explanation for the
substitution of entries in the place of deleted entries
could be that these changes were, in fact, made to the
transcript after it was typed by Ms. Cormack. It does make
sense that one would want to fill up a blank space after
deleting entries from a typed transcript, in order to hide
the fact that entries had been taken out.  While some of the
changes were made on the tapes themselves, since Ms. Cormack
noticed the Senator's tape changes as she typed, she
testified that in the two week period from mid-to-late
October 1993, on more than one occasion, Senator Packwood
brought back to her pages she had already transcribed that
he had subsequently changed, and asked her to make those
changes.  She could not remember what time period these
changes covered.  While the Senator says he does not believe
he changed any pre-deposition entries during this period, he
testified that it is possible that he did change entries
from either 1992 or pre-October 1993 as they came off Ms.
Cormack's typewriter, after his deposition was interrupted
on October 6, 1993 and after he received the Committee's
subpoena on October 21, 1993.

    Consistent with the evidence, one could reasonably
conclude as follows: that after the Committee asked for his
diaries on October 6, 1993, Senator Packwood went to Ms.
Cormack and retrieved the untyped tapes for 1992 and 1993,
and mentioned the possibility of a subpoena as he did so;[fn
165] that he deleted or changed some information from the
audiotapes,[fn 166] and returned them to Ms. Cormack a few
days later;[fn 167] that as he received the typed
transcripts from her, and discovered that there was
additional material that he needed to take out, he
instructed Ms. Cormack to do so, filling up the blank
spaces, or evening out the pages with benign or exculpatory
information to disguise the deletions.

    If one concludes that Senator Packwood made the changes
during this time period, it is equally clear that Senator
Packwood was intentionally altering materials related to the
Committee's inquiry when he knew or should have known that
the Committee had sought or would likely seek these
materials.

       Counsel also notes that in his appearance before the
Committee, Senator Packwood stated that he finally told his
attorneys about the existence of the original backup
audiotapes, and the fact that he had made changes to the
1992 and 1993 tapes, after he received the subpoena from the
Department of Justice on November 19, 1993, because he
thought the Department of Justice might need them.[fn 168]
However, the Committee's subpoena, which the Senator
received almost a month earlier, specifically asked for
diary transcripts and tapes for the years 1989 through 1993.
Only days before he received the Department of Justice
subpoena, when he was discussing with the Committee the
possibility that he could resign and thereby avoid the
Committee's subpoena, Senator Packwood told Senator
McConnell, then the Committee's Vice Chairman, that he
wanted a "window of opportunity" in which to destroy his
diaries.[fn 169] Such a window would have been created if
the Committee's subpoena expired before the Department of
Justice subpoena was served. However, the Department of
Justice subpoena was served before he could resign. It is
reasonable to conclude from this sequence of events that
Senator Packwood was willing to resign if it meant that he
could destroy his diaries, and that he only told his
attorneys about the existence of original backup tapes, and
that he had altered the tapes for 1992 and 1993, when the
destruction of his diaries was no longer an option.


        e. Destruction of Evidence

      Senator Packwood testified that he made changes to a
duplicate copy of his diary tapes, and that he then made a
copy of this changed duplicate to give to Ms. Cormack to
type.[fn 170] As she finished typing, she destroyed her
copy, and he destroyed his, keeping instead the original,
unaltered diary tape, which did not correspond to the typed
transcript. If the Committee had access to the altered diary
tapes, it would better be able to establish what deletions
were made to the tapes by Senator Packwood, as these would
not be on the tapes, as opposed to what entries were simply
not typed by Ms. Cormack and, importantly, what changes were
made by Senator Packwood to the transcript after it was
typed.[fn 171] Even accepting Senator Packwood's testimony
about the timing of the changes to his diaries, he continued
to allow Ms. Cormack to destroy her copy of the altered
tapes, and he continued to destroy his, after the Committee
asked to review his diaries, and after he received the
Committee's subpoena, which specifically asked for all
audiotapes as well as transcripts. All of the altered tapes
must have been destroyed, since none were produced to the
Court in response to the Committee's subpoena. Likewise,
since no transcript pages marked by Senator Packwood for
changes by Ms. Cormack were provided to the Court, these
must also have been destroyed by Senator Packwood and/or Ms.
Cormack.

    It is ~clear from the October 20, 1993 letter from
Senator Packwood's attorneys to the Committee, stating that
only half of the 1992 tapes had been typed and were ready
for review by Committee counsel, and from Cathy Cormack's
testimony that the two week period of mid-to-late October
was part of the "crunch time" for typing the transcripts,
that a significant number of altered tapes were transcribed,
and the tapes destroyed, after the Committee specifically
asked for the diaries, and after the Committee more
specifically subpoenaed all diary tapes as well as diary
transcripts.  Thus, Senator Packwood created an altered
version of his diaries wherein a significant number of the
alterations related specifically to the Committee's inquiry
or to matters within the Committee's jurisdiction, and then
destroyed the evidence (the altered tapes) which was
critical to a determination as to the purpose of the
changes, which purpose the Senator has testified had no
relationship to the Committee's inquiry.

      f.   Reliance on the Advice of Counsel

    Senator Packwood has repeatedly stated that he felt free
to alter his diaries during 1993 because his attorneys made
the determination that the Committee was not entitled to
them, and that, in making those changes, he relied upon the
fact that his attorneys were not providing the Committee
with any diary excerpts in response to the Committee's
requests.  Senator Packwood testified that his attorneys
made the decision to withhold his diaries from the Committee
in response to its document requests.  Despite repeated
questioning, he could not elaborate on precisely what his
attorneys told him on this subject.  Nevertheless, this
claim, that his attorneys made the decision about what to
provide to the Committee, is corroborated by Mr. Fitzpatrick
of Arnold & Porter.

    Senator Packwood, however, was not charged by the
Committee with a failure to turn over his diaries to the
Committee in response to its requests.  The Committee
charged Senator Packwood with intentionally altering his
diaries after he knew or should have known that the
Committee had sought or would likely seek them.  Senator
Packwood was certainly entitled to rely upon his attorneys'
decision to withhold his diaries on the grounds of
privilege, even if his attorneys' judgment was later proven
to be incorrect.  But Senator Packwood's attorneys did not
advise him that it was permissible to alter his diaries,
privileged or not. Indeed, his attorneys did not even know
that he was altering his diaries until November 21, 1993,
the day before they resigned. Senator Packwood cannot shift
responsibility for the alteration of his diaries to his
attorneys.

     Moreover, Counsel notes that Senator Packwood began
changing his diaries in January 1993, at least two months
before he received the Committee's document request on March
29, 1993. Senator Packwood told the Committee that his
attorneys made the decision not to turn over his diaries to
the Committee sometime after the Committee's March 29, 1993
document request.  Even accepting Senator Packwood's
assertion that he felt free to change his diaries because of
his counsel's decision not to turn them over to the
Committee, there was no such advice to rely upon when he was
changing the 1992 tapes during January, February, and most
of March. 1993.

    It should not be overlooked that Senator Packwood is
himself a lawyer.  He knew as early as December 1992, when
his attorneys asked him for excerpts from his diaries
touching on the intimidation issue, and as he provided them
with other excerpts from the diary throughout early 1993,
that his attorneys considered his diaries important to his
defense to the extent they contained material relevant to
the Committee's inquiry. It is certainly reasonable to
expect that Senator Packwood could anticipate that the
Committee might also want access to his diaries at some
point.  Indeed, an entry in Senator Packwood's original
diary audiotape (which does not appear in the Cormack
transcript, dated March 29, 1993 because the Senator deleted
it), the same day that Senator Packwood received the
Committee's document request, makes it clear that Senator
Packwood was concerned that the Committee might get access
to his diaries. Those diaries contained information that was
directly relevant to the Committee's inquiry.  Regardless of
his attorneys' determination about what he could withhold
from the Committee, Senator Packwood knew the importance of
preserving the integrity of anything that might at some
point become evidence in an ongoing inquiry, and the
consequences of altering any such potential evidence.


       g.   Conclusions

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood
intentionally changed entries in his diaries that related to
the subject of the Committee's inquiry, or to areas of
possible misconduct that were subject to the Committee's
jurisdiction, at a time when he was the subject of an
inquiry into misconduct by the Committee, and when he knew
or should have known that the Committee would likely seek or
had sought those diaries as evidence in its inquiry.

    It is not necessary to Counsel's finding of improper
conduct to also find that Senator Packwood acted for the
specific purpose of obstructing the Committee's inquiry.
Such a determination is better left to other authorities,
and Counsel defers to their eventual judgment on this
matter.  Counsel does find, however, that Senator Packwood
purposefully selected and changed entries in his diary tapes
for 1992 and 1993 that he knew were relevant to the
Committee's inquiry, and that could be incriminating to him,
along with other entries that could result in Committee
inquiry into other activity.

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's
actions were contemptuous of and subverted the Senate's
Constitutional self-disciplinary process.  By delegation of
authority from the Senate, the Committee is specifically
empowered to obtain evidence from Members and others who are
the subject of Committee inquiry, and it is entitled to rely
on the integrity of such evidence.  Indeed, the entire
process is compromised and rendered wholly without value if
persons subject to the Committee's inquiry, or witnesses in
an inquiry, are allowed to jeopardize the integrity of
evidence coming before the Committee.

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's
actions constitute an abuse of his position as a United
States Senator, are a violation of his duty of trust to the
Senate, and constitute improper conduct reflecting discredit
upon the United states Senate.

    Counsel suggests that the matter of diary alteration is
appropriate for referral to the Department of Justice for
its attention pursuant to Committee Rule 8(a).

Endnotes

147.  This privilege log identified memoranda, but it did
not indicate in any way that the memoranda included diary
excerpts or pages.

148.  It is very clear, however, that the privilege log
contains absolutely no reference to or mention of diaries.

149.  Senator Packwood had previously testified at his
deposition that his attorneys asked him in late July or
early August to have the rest of hi6 diaries, i.e., the
entries for 1992 and 1993, transcribed, and that it was this
request that caused him to go back and change his 1993 diary
tapes, out of fear that the transcribed diaries would be
leaked from his attorneys' office if they should ever be
provided to them.

150.  This indicates that Arnold & Porter received on this
date the transcribed diaries up through the end of January
1992, as that is when the pages cease to be numbered.  It
also indicates that entries after January 1992 (other than
the entries for November and December 1992 previously
provided to them in January 1993) were not completed until
after that date.

151.   Examples include lengthy discourses on food, music,
movies, and Senator Packwood's relationships with and
observations about various women.

152.  In fact, Ms. Cormack testified that she could conceive
of no circumstances under which she would have typed the
entry as it appears in the transcript, had she heard the
entry on the audiotape.

153.  The deleted entry corroborates information from
another witness, who told the staff that the former
staffer/complainant told him one day at work that the former
staffer had gotten drunk at her apartment and spent the
night on her couch, and that she was telling the witness
about this because she was worried that the former staffer
might tell others that he had spent the night with her.

154.  The diary entry for November 29, 1989 contains a
graphic description of Senator Packwood and the staffer
making love in his Senate office.

155.  The staffer was interviewed by the staff, but would
not answer questions about whether she was ever the subject
of any unwanted sexual advances by Senator Packwood.

156.  Ms. Cormack testified that she would not have typed
the first and third passages as they appear on the
transcript, had she heard what was on the audiotape.
Although it was possible that she skipped over the second
passage, this entry did not fall into any of the categories
that she was "boiling down" for the sake of time.

157.  Nor could Ms. Cormack, who did not even know who the
former Ethics Committee Staff Director was.

158.  Ms. Cormack testified that the first passage was not
the type of entry that she would have left out of the
transcript as she was typing, although it was possible that
she could have missed it as she typed the transcript. She
did not believe she would intentionally have left it out.

159.  Senator Packwood stated that he added this information
to the tape sometime between January and April of 1993.

160.  Of course, if the Committee had the altered tapes from
which Ms. Cormack transcribed the 1992 and 1993 diaries, it
would be better able to pinpoint which entries Ms. Cormack
skipped over, as they would still be on the tape, and which
entries Senator Packwood deleted, as they would be missing
from the tape, and which entries were altered after the
transcripts had been typed.  Despite his knowledge as of
October 6, 1993 that the Committee wanted to see his
diaries, and his receipt of a subpoena on October 21, 1993
for all of his diary tapes and transcripts, Senator Packwood
never instructed Ms. Cormack not to continue her usual
practice of erasing her copy after she finished typing it.
Senator Packwood testified that he also erased his copy of
the changed tape, keeping instead the original, unchanged
diary tape.

161.  While the deleted entries about the Oregon Citizens
Alliance, which raise questions about his campaign tactics,
do not appear to implicate Senator Packwood in any official
misconduct, it is not clear whether this was not a matter of
concern to Senator Packwood at the time he made the changes
to these entries, given the fact that he was also changing
other entries related to the campaign, dealing with possible
coordinated expenditures.  Three other deleted entries
related to dinner with his attorneys and meetings with a
friend who was a judge do not appear to relate to any
potential official misconduct.  The fact that not all of the
deleted entries related to the Ethics Committee's inquiry or
possible misconduct, however, does not preclude the
reasonable conclusion, supported by the clear weight of the
evidence, that many or most of the deletions that Senator
Packwood admitted he made appear to have been made with the
Ethics Committee in mind.

162.  ~Once the Committee asked to review his diaries in
October 1993, Senator Packwood gave his attorneys copies of
the transcripts for 1992 and 1993 prepared from the altered
tapes as Ms. Cormack typed it, to be reviewed by his
attorneys and provided to the Committee.  He did not,
however, tell his attorneys that these transcripts had been
typed from altered tapes.  As late as October 20, 1993,
Senator Packwood's attorneys wrote the Committee advising it
that some of the transcript for 1992 would be forthcoming
for the Committee's review.

163.  Moreover, if Senator Packwood made changes to his
diaries for benign purposes, why did he not simply listen to
the tapes and identify those changes for the Committee after
he lost in Court, instead of leaving to the Committee the
task of transcribing his tapes and comparing them to the
Cormack transcript?  He was specifically invited to do so by
Senate Legal Counsel.

164.  Of course, all such evidence was not received by the
Committee, because the altered tapes were destroyed.

165.  At her third deposition, over a year after the events
in question, Ms. Cormack recalled that Senator Packwood
picked up audiotapes from her in September 1993, not
October.  This is consistent with Senator Packwood's
testimony.  However, Senator Packwood's diary for October 9,
1993, indicates that he dropped off the tapes to Ms. Cormack
on that date, and asked her to type seven of them right
away, and another diary entry for October 10, 1993 also
discusses her rushing to type the tapes.  Both of these
October entries were subsequently changed by Senator
Packwood, and there are no similar entries in September.
Correspondence from Senator Packwood's attorney, dated
October 20, 1993, indicates that as of that date, Ms.
Cormack had only typed about half of the diaries for 1992.
This is consistent with Ms. Cormack's testimony, describing
the two week period of mid-to- late October as part of the
"crunch time," when she was pushing hard to complete the
tapes.

166.  The Senator has testified that during December 1992
and 1993 as he was listening to the 1992-93 untranscribed
tapes he believes he may have made notes of the location of
embarrassing passages which he would not want to get into
the hands of the press.  If he had this information at hand,
the Senator could quickly locate and delete or change the
passages.

167.  Senator Packwood destroyed his copy of the changed
audiotapes, and never instructed Ms. Cormack not to destroy
hers, even after receiving the Committee's subpoena.  Thus,
it is impossible to make a full accounting of exactly which
entries were deleted from the tape by Senator Packwood,
which entries Ms. Cormack listened to but simply did not
type, and which entries Senator Packwood added by making
changes to transcript rather than tape.

168.  The Committee's subpoena of October 20, 1993
specifically asked for all tapes as well as transcripts. The
Senator explained that the DOJ subpoena jogged him to action
where the Committee subpoena had not because it involved a
possible criminal issue and he did not know what that
entailed. It is unclear why the Ethics Committee subpoena,
approved by a 94 to 6 vote of his Senate colleagues, did not
carry the same force with Senator Packwood.

169.  Senator McConnell immediately informed Senator Bryan
(then Committee chairman) and Committee Counsel of this
conversation.

170.  Ms. Cormack did not complete her transcription of the
altered tapes until at least November 9, 1993.

171.  This is significant because Ms. Cormack has testified
that during the two week period in mid-to-late October 1993,
when she was pushing to complete the diaries, on a few
occasions Senator Packwood brought her diary pages she had
already typed, with instructions on changes to be made to
them. If the Committee had the altered tapes, this would
help establish whether certain entries were changed after
the Committee had asked to review his diaries on October 6,
1993, during this mid-to-late October period.




VI.  EVIDENCE REGARDING THE ALLEGATIONS OF SOLICITING
EMPLOYMENT FOR SENATOR PACKWOOD'S SPOUSE

    The evidence relating to the issue of whether Senator
Packwood may have inappropriately linked personal financial
gain to his official position by soliciting or otherwise
encouraging offers of financial assistance from persons
having a particular interest in legislation or issues that
he could influence is set forth below.[fn 172]

A.   Steve Saunders:

     1.   Background:

    Steve Saunders worked for Senator Packwood from 1977
until 1981.  From 1977 until January, 1979, he was the
Director of Communications for the National Republican
Senatorial Committee, which Senator Packwood chaired.  From
1979 until 1981, he was the Staff Director of the Senate
Republican Conference, which Senator Packwood also chaired.
In May, 1982, he established his own consulting firm.  He is
currently the sole proprietor of an international trade
consulting firm; a sculpture export business, which markets
the work of American sculptors in the U.S. and overseas; and
a retail art gallery.  He has been close friends with both
Senator and Mrs. Packwood for roughly sixteen years. He is a
registered foreign agent for the Mitsubishi Electric
Corporation ("Mitsubishi").

     2.  The November 1989 Diary Entries:

    The most significant diary entries relating to Mr.
Saunders are dated November 3 and November 6, 1989,
respectively.  The November 3 entry provides, in pertinent
part, as follows:

"Saunders arrived and he and I went over to the Tortilla
Coast or whatever that place is for beers.  I drank two
quickly and I said, "Steve, I need to talk about the purpose
of the meeting." Steve said, "I think I  know.  You and
Georgie are splitting."  I said, "Well, I think we're going
to separate and I kind of want to know if you could be of
some help."  He said, "In what fashion."  I said, "I don't
know how much your firm makes."  He says, "We're doing $600
to $700 thousand a year now."  I said I wonder if you can
put Georgie on a retainer." He says "How much?"  I said,
"$7500 a year."  He says, "$7500 a year ???"  I said,
"Yeah."  He said, "Consider it done.   When he said `yeah' I
think he thought I was going to say a month.  He said, "I'd
be happy to do it."...But in any event, I've now got her
$20,000.  $7500 from Ron, $7500 from Steve, $5000 from [name
omitted]."[fn 173]

     Three days later, on Monday, November 6, 1989, Senator
Packwood recorded the following in his diary:

"At a request of Steve Saunders I stopped in at the Finance
Committee to read two questions which I wanted asked of a
man named Spero, the President of Fusion something or other.
This guy's been carrying on a vendetta with the Japanese
about patents for years, first in the Commerce Committee
with Jay Rockefeller pushing it there and then in the
Finance Committee with Jay pushing it again.  It's funny.
Fusion is in Maryland.  I don't know what the connection is
with West Virginia.  Steve Saunders thinks that Jay is just
genuinely concerned but he keeps pushing and pushing this
issue so I said of course I'd go and ask the questions."[fn
174]

       A transcript of the November 6, 1989 Finance
Committee hearing indicates that Senator Packwood briefly
attended the hearing, read two questions he wanted asked of
Mr. Spero into the record, and then left.[fn 175] Documents
produced by Mr. Saunders indicate that questions virtually
identical to the ones asked by Senator Packwood at the
hearing were submitted to a Finance Committee staffer by Mr.
Saunders on November 6, 1989.[fn 176] In other documents
submitted by Mr. Saunders, he advised his client Mitsubishi
that Senator Packwood was not originally scheduled to attend
the hearing and rearranged his schedule at the last minute
because Mr. Saunders asked him to appear.[fn 177]

     3. Senator Packwood's Testimony:

      At his deposition, Senator Packwood testified that on
November 3, he had been drinking in the office before Mr.
Saunders arrived. He stated that he drank a lot very quickly
and was quite drunk, but he does remember going with Mr.
Saunders to Tortilla Coast. He stated that he thinks they
discussed Mr. Saunders hiring Mrs. Packwood, but he
emphasized that this was - drunken evening for him.

      Senator Packwood testified that he does not recall any
of the specific conversation recorded in the November 3,
1989 diary entry. He stated that he thinks the meeting was
held at his behest. The Senator stated that when Mr.
Saunders and he and Mrs. Packwood had been in Asia the year
before, he had discussed his marital situation with Mr.
Saunders and he had offered to help. Referring to the
November 3 entry, Senator Packwood stated that "whether I
said exactly this or not, I think I asked him if he was
prepared to sort of follow up on what he had said." Senator
Packwood testified that he cannot recall whether they
specifically discussed Mr. Saunders employing Mrs. Packwood
prior to the November 3 meeting. Rather, he only recalls the
offer to help, as the colloquy below demonstrates:

"Q: Just to clarify, Senator, in terms of your discussions
with Mr. Saunders, I believe you had said that you had had a
conversation with Mr. Saunders prior to this time [Nov. 3]
in which there was some discussion about employing Mrs.
Packwood: is that correct?

A: That, I can't remember. Because I remember the gallery
part. And whether it was before this or not--what I
remember, Steve was a good friend. He knew about my marital
troubles and had offered to help. Whether or not at that
stage he says I'm opening an art gallery, I can't remember.
But it was the offer to help that I recall.

Q:  And when you say here I wonder if you can put Georgie on
a retainer, as I understand your testimony, you simply can't
recall whether you said that or not?

A:  I don't recall any of the specific conversation.

Q:  But given the context of what you described, I presume
that it's possible that was said?

A:  Well, what I remember is talking to him about a job.
Beyond that, I can't remember."

    Senator Packwood testified that he has no memory of any
discussion at the November 3 meeting of the upcoming hearing
on patents before the Finance Committee.  Nor does he recall
whether Mr. Saunders offered him any written materials in
connection with the hearing on patents.  He does not recall
any discussion of Mitsubishi on November 3, although he was
aware of Mr. Saunder's representation of Mitsubishi. The
Senator testified that the Mitsubishi/Fusion issue was one
that he had been working on for about 18 months as of
November, 1989.  He stated that he believed Fusion was
inappropriately using Congressional hearings as a forum for
complaining because they were unsuccessful in their
commercial dispute with Mitsubishi.

    Turning to the November 6, 1989 entry, Senator Packwood
testified that he does not remember Mr. Saunders calling him
to request that he attend the hearing.  He testified that,
"He [Saunders] may have called and said would you mind
asking him [Spero] personally."   When questioned further
about the entry and why he attended the hearing, Senator
Packwood responded as follows:

"Q:  Is that what you think you meant by "at a request of
Steve Saunders?"

A:  Well, I don't remember the phone call.  I don't remember
the questions, other than apparently they were questions I
was going to submit, I would judge, the way this reads.  And
whether he called and said would you mind asking him
personally or not, I don't know.  This is a common thing
that all of us do.  If someone calls us up--apparently these
are questions my staff did, but quite frequently you'll get
questions from lobbyists that send you in questions and say
will you go in and ask this.

Q:  Would it be fair to say that Mr. Saunders is the one
that brought the dispute between Mitsubishi and Fusion to
your attention?

A:  He may have been the one that initially brought it to my
attention 18 months or so ago.

Q:  Do you recall specifically whether it was him or someone
with his organization?

A:  No, I don't recall.

Q:  And again, to the language at the very first sentence
where you say "at a request of Steve Saunders," I believe
you touched on this, but let me be sure I understand.  Do
you recall any type of written or telephonic communication
from Mr. Saunders where he actually made the request for you
to attend this committee hearing and ask these questions?

A:  No, I don't...."

    With respect to his handwritten calendar of events,
which contains an entry that reads "Finance for Saunders,"
Senator Packwood denied that there was a connection between
attending the hearing and Mr. Saunders:

"Q:  That would suggest that in your mind, there was
connection between attending that hearing and Steve
Saunders; is that correct?

A:   No. I think it is more likely that if he'd [Saunders]
called me up and ask me to go ask the questions as opposed
to my just handing them in and asking whoever was chairing
the hearing that day, that I went up and asked the
questions.  Not that I was attending the meeting for him.
This was an issue I'd been following for this long period of
time.  And I knew this guy Spero was going to be there, but
I apparently had not intended to go to the meeting, but just
turn the questions in and maybe Steve said please go ask
them personally so I put this entry in.

Q:  Do you believe you would have personally attended the
hearing but for Mr. Saunders request?

A:  That I can't remember now.

Q:  So as I understand it, there wasn't a question as to
whether you were going to have these questions asked, but
rather a question if you would personally attend and ask the
questions; is that correct, as opposed to submitting them in
writing?

A: Yes, although "personally attend" doesn't necessarily
mean stay at the meeting...."

    Senator Packwood testified that he does not recall any
discussion with Mr. Saunders about any type of connection or
relationship between Mr. Saunder's hiring Mrs. Packwood and
the questions that he wanted asked at the November 6
hearing. Nor was there any type of implicit understanding
that there was a connection or relationship between his
discussions with Mr. Saunders about hiring Mrs. Packwood and
the questions he wanted asked at the November 6 hearing.  In
this regard, Senator Packwood testified as follows:

"Q:  ...do you believe that there was a connection between
your discussions with Mr. Saunders about employment
opportunities for Mrs. Packwood and his request of you to
ask certain questions at this hearing?

A:  Absolutely not.  Steve was a close friend, had been for
a decade and a quarter.  I'd travelled with him.   I'd
worked on this issue with him for 18 months, and I would
have done this if I would have never met with him on Friday
night."

     4.   Brief History of Senator Packwood's Involvement in
the Japanese Patent Issue:

    In a letter dated November 16, 1993 to Mr. Brooks
Jackson of CNN, Senator Packwood provided a history of his
involvement in the Japanese patent issue.  He explained that
his interest in this issue began around June of 1988 when he
was preparing for a hearing before the Senate Commerce
Committee's Subcommittee on Foreign Commerce and Tourism.
In preparation of this hearing, he stated that his staff had
described the dispute between Fusion Systems and Mitsubishi
and Mitsubishi's hope that the hearing would focus on larger
policy issues.  During the course of this hearing, Senator
Packwood asked U.S. government officials how the U.S. patent
system stacked up against the systems of other countries.
He also requested an additional hearing to hear from U.S.
companies who had some success working with the Japanese
patent system.

    In his November 16 letter, Senator Packwood goes on to
state that on January 27, 1989, during the confirmation
hearings on the nomination of Carla Hills to U.S. Trade
Representative before the Senate Finance Committee, he asked
Ms. Hills to speak with experts in the patent area before
making any decisions on issues involving the Japanese patent
office.  Then, on February 28, 1989, the Commerce
Committee's Subcommittee on Foreign Commerce and Tourism
held its second hearing on the Japanese patent system.   At
this hearing, he again asked U.S. government officials
whether the U.S. patent system or the Japanese patent system
was more in line with the rest of the industrialized
world.[fn 178]

    Senator Packwood concludes his letter by asserting that
he has had a longstanding interest in intellectual property
issues. He states that during the 1988-89 hearings, he kept
hearing how the Japanese system was unfair and
discriminatory.  However, he discovered that the Japanese
patent system was more in step with the rest of the
industrialized world than the U.S. system.   He states that
his efforts were an attempt to ensure balance in the review
of the patent issue.

      5.   Mr. Saunders's Testimony:

    Mr. Saunders recalls that in the 1980's, his firm was
retained by Mitsubishi to advise it on various trade issues.
In 1987 or 1988, his company began working with Mitsubishi's
Washington lawyers, lobbyists and public relations advisors
regarding a dispute between Mitsubishi and a Maryland
company called Fusion.  According to Mr. Saunders,
Mitsubishi had been attempting to negotiate a settlement of
a dispute with Fusion over patents in Japan for several
years.  The head of Fusion, a Mr. Spero, decided that he
wanted to try to apply additional pressure on Mitsubishi to
reach a favorable settlement.  Spero engaged the interest of
the office of the U.S. Trade Representative, which
ultimately resulted in the Deputy U.S.T.R. telling
Mitsubishi executives that they should settle their dispute
with Fusion on terms favorable to Fusion because the issue
had become political in the United States.  Mr. Saunders
claims that he advised Mitsubishi that in the case of a
home- grown American entrepreneur fighting a Goliath
Japanese company, the best Mitsubishi could hope to
accomplish was keeping the record straight.  It was decided
that the best way to deal with the publicity generated by
Mr. Spero's efforts was to present the facts about the
functions of the Japanese patent system and the
Mitsubishi/Fusion dispute to members and staff of the Senate
Commerce and Finance Committees.

    Mr. Saunders recalls that during 1988, various persons
associated with the firms retained by Mitsubishi met several
times with Senator Packwood and members of his staff.  Mr.
Saunders sat in on at least two of these meetings during
1988 and 1989, which were arranged by Mitsubishi's lobbying
firm, Thompson & Co.  Mr. Saunders got involved because it
became apparent that they needed to contact Senator
Packwood, who was a senior member of the Commerce Committee
and a leading free trader.  He stated that his firm became
involved because there had been a history of poor relations
between the Senator and Bob Thompson of Thompson & Co.  Mr.
Saunders stated that Senator Packwood became very interested
in the differences between the U.S. patent system and the
patent systems used by other countries, including Japan.
The Senator was not interested in the details of the dispute
between Mitsubishi and Fusion.

       On November 3, 1989, Mr. Saunders stated that he and
Senator Packwood had dinner at a Mexican restaurant on
Capitol. Hill.  He testified that he believes Senator
Packwood was impaired by the alcohol he consumed at this
dinner, although he described the Senator as a "functional
alcoholic."  Mr. Saunders claims that they did not discuss
business matters whatsoever, including the upcoming November
6 hearing.  There was no discussion of Mitsubishi or Fusion
or the patent issue.  Rather, he maintains they only
discussed their families and personal lives.  He testified
that the Senator asked him what he was doing in his business
and Mr. Saunders told him about his plans to start a
sculpture exporting business and an art gallery.  He
testified that the Senator asked him how much his :business
was making and Mr. Saunders told him "$600,000 to $700,000 a
year."

    Senator Packwood then told him that he and his wife were
going to divorce.  He testified that the Senator told him
that he wanted to "simplify his life" and that he was "tired
of carrying all these people (i.e., his wife and children)."
Although there had been some discussion of divorce in Asia
the year before, Mr. Saunders stated that there was no
discussion of employment for the Senator's wife at that
time.  The Senator also told Mr. Saunders that he had not
yet told his wife about his plans to divorce and asked him
not to say anything to her.  Mr. Saunders asked what Mrs.
Packwood would do and the Senator responded that he did not
know.  Mr. Saunders recalls that Senator Packwood then
stated that he was a little worried about Mrs. Packwood's
future sources of income.  He told Senator Packwood that he
did not think he had any reason to worry because Mrs.
Packwood had been operating a successful antique business
for several years and was talented in the buying and selling
of antiques.

    Mr. Saunders recalls that he told Senator Packwood that
he had been thinking about calling Mrs. Packwood to help him
with his new venture of marketing American sculpture in
Japan.  At that time, Mr. Saunders was in the process of
setting up his sculpture exporting business and was in the
beginning stages of setting up his gallery.  It had occurred
to him that Mrs. Packwood would be valuable to him because
he believed that Mrs. Packwood's skill in the antique
business was easily transferable to the contemporary art
business.  He testified that he initiated the idea of Mrs.
Packwood working for him and that the Senator did not
suggest such an arrangement.  Mr. Saunders stated that he
did not think the Senator was trying to solicit an offer of
employment for his wife during this dinner.

    Mr. Saunders testified that he specifically asked
whether the Senator had any ethical problem with the idea
because he was a registered foreign agent, and the Senator
said no.  The Senator asked him to keep him informed of the
status of his discussions with Mrs. Packwood.

    Mr. Saunders recalls that Senator Packwood asked how
much money his wife could earn working for him.  He advised
the Senator that this would depend on how much time she
wanted to work and what type of wage or commission
arrangement she wanted to negotiate.  Senator Packwood asked
if she could make at least $7,500 a year.  Mr. Saunders said
that he thought she could easily make $7500 a year, although
it struck him as somewhat of an odd figure.  Mr. Saunders
does not recall ever discussing putting Mrs. Packwood on a
retainer.

    On the morning of the November 6, 1989 hearing, Mr.
Saunders testified that he heard that Senator Packwood would
not be able to attend due to scheduling conflicts.  He
called Senator Packwood and urged him to at least stop in at
the hearing and read the questions that he had submitted
into the record. Senator Packwood said he was unsure whether
he could and asked whether he had received the questions.
Mr. Saunders testified that he had submitted proposed
questions for the Senator to ask at the hearing to a staffer
named Rolf Lundberg.  He does not recall having any
discussions with the Senator about the Fusion issue after
the November 6 hearing.  Mr. Saunders testified that he
never had any discussion with the Senator about attending
the hearing or asking questions at the hearing in connection
with the employment proposal for Mrs. Packwood.

    Mr. Saunders recalls that he called Mrs. Packwood soon
after his dinner with Senator Packwood to discuss his
proposal.  Over the next several months, Mr. Saunders spoke
with Mrs. Packwood several times about the possibility of
her helping him with the entity that would become his
sculpture business and eventually, with his art gallery.
Some time in March or April of 1990, they got together to
discuss his proposal in detail.  In June, 1990, Mr. Saunders
arranged for Mrs. Packwood to attend several sessions of the
International Sculpture Conference in Washington, D.C. to
see whether she would feel comfortable with the contemporary
art business.  Mr. Saunders recalls that after attending the
conference, Mrs. Packwood told him she was not comfortable
with contemporary sculpture and felt it was too far removed
from her field.  She indicated that she would be willing,
however, to arrange antique buying trips and gallery visits
for visiting clients of his consulting firm and their wives
if there were any opportunities for that kind of work.

    By June of 1990, Mr. Saunders had heard from Mrs.
Packwood that other friends had spontaneously offered her
jobs.  She was persuaded that most of the people making her
offers were asked to do so by the Senator in order to reduce
the potential demand for alimony.  It was at this time that
she indicated that she thought Mr. Saunders was being used
by the Senator.  In one of his last conversations with the
Senator about this subject, Mr. Saunders testified that the
Senator became extremely interested in how much money his
wife could earn.  The Senator then stated that the alimony
settlement could bankrupt him.  He also asked Mr. Saunders
for a statement describing his job offer to be used at the
divorce trial, but Mr. Saunders refused.  Mr. Saunders
stated that although he did not feel coerced by the Senator,
he did feel manipulated.

    Mr. Saunders testified that although his first
conversation with Senator Packwood about Mrs. Packwood's
possible role in helping him develop his art businesses and
his telephone call to the Senator to request that he attend
the hearing on the Japanese patent system occurred three
days apart, there was no connection in his mind between the
job offer and his work for Mitsubishi. He stated that Mrs.
Packwood had been extremely close to his family at critical
times in his family's life.  He stated there was never an
express or implied quid pro quo.  He explained that the
Packwoods were two friends going through an agonizing
situation and he was trying to act as a friend.  He
explained that the Senator was a friend and that Mrs.
Packwood was an even closer friend.

    6.   Other Diary Entries Referring to Mr. Saunders and
Job Offers for Mrs. Packwood and Related Testimony:

        a.    10/18/89

    In addition to the two diary entries discussed above,
there are other diary entries spanning the time frame from
October 1989 through June of 1990 in which Senator Packwood
makes various references to Mr. Saunders extending
employment opportunities to Mrs. Packwood.  On October 18,
1989, he recorded the following entry in his diary:

"...I did have time to come back to the office, talk to Tim
Lee and he says he'll be happy to put up $10,000 a year for
Georgie.  That's three out of three and I haven't even hit
up [name omitted] or Steve Saunders.  I've got to handle
this carefully.  I don't want in any way there to be any
quid pro quo.  There shall not be any quid pro quo. I'm not
going to do anything for these guys that I would not do for
them anyway.  My  hunch is :1'11 get something out of
Saunders and out of [name omitted].  I think I'll ask them
for $5000 apiece and hold it in reserve and indicate to
Georgie that if she'll say she can make $20,000 I'll make
sure she gets another $20,000.[fn 179]  Then I'll come up
with more and that will give me enough of an asset base to
be able to buy a small two bedroom townhouse."

    When asked to explain what he meant by the words "hit
up," Senator Packwood testified that his "use of the phrase
'hit up' is to call somebody."[fn 180] He went on to
testify:

"Q:  Were you calling these people for a particular purpose?

A:  I would have been calling them to see if they would
provide some help for me with Georgie.

Q:  When you say "help," do you mean income?

A: Yes. That wouldn't be quite the same with [name omitted],
but go ahead.

Q: What did you mean when you said--

A:  Hold on a second.  All of these people, as you're well
aware that I called were old friends.  They had all in one
form or another, discovered the possibility of separation,
had indicated they wanted to help.  And I don't want in any
way for you to think the term "hit up" as in other than I'm
going to call and see if they can be of help, following up
on their suggestion that if anything was going to happen
they would be of help.

Q:  But the purpose of calling them was to talk about income
or job opportunities or business opportunities for Mrs.
Packwood?

A:  Yes, to discuss that."

    Senator Packwood also testified at length with respect
to the quid pro quo reference in his diary:

"Q:  Were you at all concerned, Senator, about the propriety
of having discussions with or making requests of persons who
might have an interest in legislation, having discussions
about job opportunities or business opportunities for Mrs.
Packwood? ...

A:  These were old friends.  I've been in politics a quarter
of a century and would there be, I suppose, a thousand
lobbyists you could go to and make this kind of a request? I
assume there would be.  I didn't go to them.  I went to
people that I had known, that were friends of mine, in some
cases drinking buddies of mine, in all cases, all long
standing friends.

I did not go to them because they were lobbyists and I did
not ever do anything for them nor would I do anything for
them that I would not have otherwise have done but for
Georgie and I being separated, married or otherwise.  And I
saw nothing wrong with going to people that had been long-
standing friends, personal friends and asking for help.

And especially when I made it very clear, and you've
probably seen it somewhere before when I said there's to be
no quid pro quo, not only here but .in the memo to the
marriage counselor, where there was to be no quid pro quo
and she was to keep track of her hours and records.  And if
she could not perform value received, then she would not be
paid.  I did everything I could to make sure this was legal
and ethical...

Q:  ...Were you concerned about a potential quid pro quo?

A:  No, I was not concerned about a potential quid pro quo
at all.  I don't do business that way.  I don't trade my
votes for money and I was not going to do any quid pro quo.

Q:  Why did you--do you know why you recorded these
thoughts?  They appear to reflect a concern about a quid pro
quo.

A:  You will find those thoughts all through my diary...It's
nothing unique here.  That is the way I think....

Q:  I appreciate that.  My question, Senator, is in the
context of talking about and having conversations with these
persons about providing income to Mrs. Packwood, in that
same passage or at the end of that passage, you make
reference to you do not want there to be any quid pro quo,
not wanting to do anything for these guys that you wouldn't
do for them anyway.  And I guess my question is:  Why--do
you know why you put those thoughts, why you recorded those
thoughts--

 A:  As I said, you'll see this kind of entry all through my
diary dealing with different people.  Conversations, I've
often said, are not necessarily accurate.  Thoughts may be
more accurate...I put this in here because these are my
thoughts...I don't do business that way...So I put it in
because that's the way--I can't remember on this particular
one why I put it in.  That's just the way I think....

Q:  ...In general, why would you have expressed those
thoughts in connection with discussions relating to persons
about job opportunities for Mrs. Packwood?

A:  Why would I express it that way?  Any place else in the
diary, where somebody's coming in and I say by God, that's
not the way I do business.  Because those are my thoughts. I
don't do business that way, and this diary is full of
thoughts.

Q:  Is there a reason specifically that those thoughts, that
is thoughts about quid pro quos, would have been included in
discussions about business opportunities for Mrs. Packwood?

A:  Only in the sense I was going to make sure there would
be no quid pro quo.  And I did not want to do anything that
would be a quid pro quo."


        b.   12/16/89 Through 1/].8/90

    On December 16, 1989, Senator Packwood again referred to
Mr. Saunders in his diary, expressing a desire for him to
call Mrs. Packwood and "indicate the money he [was] willing
to spend on her."[fn 181]  Senator Packwood testified that
he was hoping to eventually obtain approximately $20,000 for
Mrs. Packwood with respect to the offers of employment.  On
January 7, 1990, Senator Packwood noted in general that "it
is imperative that she be willing to accept some business.
If she says she won't I'll still have to try to get her some
and see what happens."  On January 18, 1990, Senator
Packwood again referred to Mr. Saunders:

"I hit [name omitted] up. He says 'yes.' [name omitted] a
close friend  but not as close as Cliff.  The same with
Saunders, same with Ron.  They just say bang, bang,
bang--yes. But not Cliff. That means next week I've got to
turn to Saunders and then to Crawford."

    Here, Senator Packwood testified that when he recorded
"hit Up" he meant asking him if he could talk Georgie into a
job.


      c.   1/24/90

    On January 24, 1990, Senator Packwood recorded three
entries involving job offers to his wife.  In the first of
these entries, after mentioning that he wanted Mr. Saunders
(as well as others) to call Mrs. Packwood about the job
offer, he recorded the following:

"I'll get Saunders to do the same.  Then I can't decide
whether it is [name omitted] or [name omitted] Tim Lee, or
Crawford.  I don't think I'll go beyond that right now.  I
want her to have at least $20,000  in offers.  Boy, I'm
scating  [sic] on thin ice here.  I'm glad I put in writing
to her...that I'll help her get business but she must give
service for value and that this is and I used the word--this
is not to be a bribe for me or gift to you and if you cannot
perform the service, then your income or retainer will have
to be reduced or eliminated...."

    When asked about this entry, Senator Packwood responded
as follows:

"Q:  ...What did you mean by "Boy, I'm skating on thin ice
here?"

A:  You asked earlier, could anybody construe this to be--I
don't know if you said unethical or illegal or something
like that, and I answered you've seen what the press will
construe to be illegal or unethical.  It's perfectly
allright [sic].  And I knew what I was doing was perfectly
allright, or I thought I knew what I was doing was perfectly
allright.  And I checked it as best I could[fn 182] and I
didn't want anybody to construe it any differently than
that.  I didn't want the press to do something if this got
out....

Q:  What did you mean by the reference "I'm skating on thin
ice here?"

A:  That's where the press can take something that's
perfectly legal, legitimate, moral and ethical and try to
turn it into something wrong."

    Also on January 24, 1990, Senator Packwood noted in his
diary that Mr. Saunders had contacted him regarding the job
offer to Mrs. Packwood:

"I talked to Steve Saunders.  I was returning his call.  He
had talked to Georgie.  She had returned his call.  He said
he had a business proposition for her and the first question
was, "Did Bob put you up to this?"  He said, "No."  He was
lying, but he said 'no.' He said, "I called him because it
involves Epson.  Epson-America, of course has their major
plant in Hillsboro [Oregon] and I wanted to make sure there
was no conflict of interest.  Bob said 'no' and I said, 'Do
you think Georgie would be interested?,' and he said, 'You'd
better call her. I don't know... "

    With respect to this entry, Senator Packwood testified
that he does not recall this conversation.  He stated that
Mr. Saunders knew that Mrs. Packwood would be angry if she
knew he was involved in the offer.  The Senator testified as
follows:

"Q:  Had you, in fact told him [Saunders] to do this?

A:  I'd ask him to call...he at some stage said Bob, what
can I do to help and we talked about his help and to that
extent, after he'd asked first could I be of help, but he
wasn't going to say to her Bob told me to do this or she
would have been livid."

    He also testified that he could not recall having any
discussions with Mr. Saunders about Mrs. Packwood's
qualifications for the job.

    Mr. Saunders testified that in one of his early
conversations with Mrs. Packwood, she may have asked whether
her husband put him up to offering her a job.  He testified
that the Senator's reference to him lying in the January 24,
1990 entry is inaccurate.


      d.   4/13/90

    On April 13, 1990, Senator Packwood recorded in his
diary another conversation with Mr. Saunders relating to the
job offer for Mrs. Packwood:

"I got ahold of Steve Saunders and said it's time to put the
proposal in writing also and Saunders says, 'Well, let me
tell you what the latest is.  I talked with Georgie
yesterday...she is interested in escorting these women
around town on shopping tours--the wives of visiting
dignitaries--but she absolutely does not want me to put
anything in writing and for the moment she is not interested
in any kind of venture with my ... sculptor art exporting
company or something like that...'"

    Senator Packwood testified that he does not recall why
he wanted the proposal in writing.  He stated that he does
not know whether the proposal was ever reduced to writing.
He stated that he has only a dim recollection of any
discussion with Mr. Saunders about Mrs. Packwood escorting
the wives of visiting dignitaries on shopping trips.

    Mr. Saunders stated that he is unsure whether he came up
with the idea of escorting the wives or whether Mrs.
Packwood first came up with this idea.  This proposal never
materialized. There was no further discussion about any type
of employment opportunity for her after June, 1990.  He does
not recall the Senator ever telling him to put the proposal
in writing.  He testified that he probably spoke with the
Senator every time he spoke with Mrs. Packwood to report on
his progress.

    Senator Packwood testified that there was no discussion
at any time with Mr. Saunders about the job offer to Mrs.
Packwood in connection with him taking or refraining from
taking any action in his capacity as a Senator.  Nor was
there any type of implied understanding that there was a
relationship between the job offer to Mrs. Packwood from Mr.
Saunders and the Senator taking any action in an official
capacity.


      7.   Mrs. Packwood's Testimony:

    Mrs. Packwood testified that soon after she first met
Mr. Saunders in roughly 1980, and even before she started
her antiques business, she had purchased Teddy Roosevelt
memorabilia for him.  Some time between January and ,June,
1990, Mrs. Packwood testified that Mr. Saunders telephoned
and asked whether she would be interested in helping a
client find North American Indian antiques.  She testified
that this was not ongoing employment. She did not accept
this proposal.[fn 183] She stated that Mr. Saunders made a
second proposal which involved buying sculpture and art for
commercial establishments in the Orient. She testified that
she believes it was proposed as "being a little ongoing
anyway." She testified that she was not interested in this
proposal and advised him accordingly.

    Mrs. Packwood testified that Mr. Saunders made a third
proposal in this time frame which involved escorting the
wives of his Japanese clients to antique shows and shops.
Mrs. Packwood testified that she had no contact with Mr.
Saunders after he made this last proposal until after the
divorce.  Mr. Saunders later suggested that Mrs. Packwood
work at the art gallery he was planning on opening if she
were going to stay in town.  By that time however, she had
decided to move back to Oregon.

    As to Mr. Saunders's knowledge of the other job offers,
Mrs. Packwood testified that she believed she ". . .  ought
to warn"  him that ". . . there's a lot of stuff going on
here that you could get caught in a web of, about finding
employment for me that I'm not instigating."  She testified
that Mr. Saunders wondered why the Senator was so interested
in how much she could earn.   She stated that she believed
that Senator Packwood became coercive and manipulative and
Mr. Saunders then backed off.

    Commenting in general, Mrs. Packwood testified that she
did not regard the proposals as job offers.  She explained
that she was not job hunting and that she viewed them as
some kind of "coercive behavior."  She went on to state,
"They [job offers] frightened me, but Bob Packwood
frightened me in his behavior at that particular time
anyway, so it was all part of a huge package of manipulation
of me."  When asked whether she believes the proposals would
have been made to her but for her husband's status as a
Senator, she testified as follows:

"The exception would be Mr. Saunders.  [With regard to] the
other proposals.  There was no reason to make them.  In all
the years I've known Ron Crawford, Tim Lee and [name
omitted], nothing ever arose in conversation or
communication of any kind between me and them to do with my
working outside my home, doing anything other than what I
had been doing for 25 years.  And it's too much of a
coincidence that they all three came forward at
approximately the same period in my life with these sudden,
whatever you call them, offers."


      8.  Summary of Senator Packwood's Response to the
Evidence:

    Senator Packwood asserts that Mr. Saunders is an old
friend who had offered to help when he learned that the
Senator was separating from his wife.  The Senator claims
that he was merely following up on Mr. Saunders' offer of
assistance when he discussed jobs and income for Mrs.
Packwood.  He contends that he turned to Mr. Saunders
because they were longstanding friends and not for reasons
related to his official position.

    With respect to the November 3, 1989 diary entry in
which he records that he asked Mr. Saunders to place his
wife on a $7500 retainer, Senator Packwood says that he was
quite drunk on this date and has no recollection of any of
the specific conversation that appears in this diary entry,
although he does recall talking to Mr. Saunders about a job
and asking him whether he was prepared to follow up on his
offer of help.  Senator Packwood maintains that he has no
recollection of discussing the November 6 Finance Committee
hearing at the November 3 meeting with Mr. Saunders.

    Senator Packwood testified that the! references in his
diary about quid pro quos simply reflect a desire on his
part that the job proposals be legally and ethically correct
and that there be no quid pro quos between the job offers
and his official actions. In this regard, he asserts that he
checked with a lawyer named Jack Quinn about the legality of
the offers.[fn 184] He also argues that he never attempted
to conceal the involvement of those persons extending job
offers to his wife because this information was publicly
discussed at his divorce trial.  Additionally, he relies on
correspondence that he sent to his wife where he states, in
part, that the job offers should not be considered as either
gifts to her or bribes to him and that she must be prepared
to provide value in return for payment.

    Senator Packwood stated that he has no recollection of
Mr. Saunders asking him to personally appear and ask
questions at the November 6 hearing.  He also says he has no
recollection of whether he would have personally attended
the hearing but for Mr. Saunders's request that he do so.
He states that his involvement in the issue of the
differences between the American and Japanese patent systems
dated back at least as early as June of 1988.

    Senator Packwood denies any connection between the
discussion of jobs and income for his wife with Mr. Saunders
and any of his official acts.

       9.  Findings:

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood did in
fact solicit or otherwise encourage an offer of personal
financial assistance from Mr. Saunders, an individual
representing a client with a particularized interest in
matters that the Senator could influence.

    Counsel finds that Senator Packwood and Mr. Saunders
engaged in discussions about job offers and income for the
Senator's wife at at time when Mr. Saunders was actively
representing a client with a specific and direct interest
before Senator Packwood's committees.  Although both have
testified that Mr. Saunders first extended a general offer
of assistance and Senator Packwood then merely followed up,
the weight of the evidence indicates that Senator Packwood's
role in encouraging and coordinating job offers for his wife
was significant.  In fact, Ethics Counsel finds that the
Senator's discussions with Mr. Saunders about job offers for
his wife comprised part of a deliberate and systematic plan
by the Senator to accumulate approximately $20,000 in job
offers for his spouse in order to reduce his alimony
obligation.  Additionally, Counsel finds that Mrs. Packwood
was not looking for a job at the time Senator Packwood
engaged Mr. Saunders in discussion about providing a job
offer to her.

    Ethics Counsel finds that Mr. Saunders's general offer
of help was extended after the Senator expressed concern
about his wife's future sources of income once they were
separated and divorced.  Moreover, Ethics Counsel finds that
the Senator's diary entries, recorded nearly
contemporaneously with the events as they occurred, suggest
that the Senator played a more active role than simply
following up with Mr. Saunders, as evidenced by the
Senator's use of language such as "hit up," place on
"retainer," and "accept the offers that I've solicited."
Further, Counsel finds that the Senator and Mr. Saunders
discussed a specific dollar amount ($7500) at their November
3, 1989 meeting.  Additionally, Counsel finds that Senator
Packwood requested Mr. Saunders to provide a statement
describing his job offer to be used at the divorce trial,
but Mr. Saunders refused.

     Ethics Counsel finds that Mr. Saunders and Senator
Packwood did have a longstanding friendship rooted in the
Mr. Saunders's prior status as an employee.  Notwithstanding
this friendship, Counsel finds that at the time they were
discussing job offers and income for Mrs. Packwood, Mr.
Saunders was representing Mitsubishi in connection with its
patent dispute with Fusion. Counsel notes that Senator
Packwood's involvement in the issue of differences between
the patent systems of Japan and the United States dated back
at least eighteen months prior to the November 6, 1989
Committee on Finance hearing and that he publicly pursued
this issue on at least three prior occasions.  Nonetheless,
Counsel finds that Senator Packwood rearranged his schedule
at the last minute to personally attend the November 6, 1989
hearing at Mr. Saunders's request, within three days of the
meeting where a job offer for Mrs. Packwood was discussed.
Additionally, Counsel finds that the questions asked by
Senator Packwood at the hearing, directed to Fusion's
president, were virtually identical to the questions
submitted by Mr. Saunders on behalf of Mitsubishi.

    Counsel finds that Mr. Saunders discussed employment
with Mrs. Packwood at various times between November 1989
and June of 1990.  Counsel further finds that Mrs. Packwood
never accepted his offer of employment.


B.   Tim Lee:

          1.   Backgrounds

    Tim Lee worked for Senator Packwood for about a year in
the mid-1970's as an intern on his Washington staff.  In the
1989-1991 time frame, he owned a company called Superior
Transportation Systems (STS), a trucking brokerage concern.
He is currently the owner of a company called Logistics
Resource Management, Inc.  His company owns rail cars,
markets rail transportation and provides transportation
consulting services.

       Regarding his fundraising role, Mr. Lee was the
chairman of the largest single event of the Senator's 1992
campaign, a breakfast with then-President Bush in 1991.  He
stated this function raised between $350,000 and $400,000
after expenses. Mr. Lee also arranged a fundraising event in
Seattle in January or February 1991, which raised between
$18,000 and 20,000.

    2.   Diary Entries Referring to Mr. Lee and Job Offers
to Mrs. Packwood and Related Testimony:

        a.   10/18/89

    Senator Packwood's diary entries relating to discussions
with Mr. Lee about employment opportunities for Mrs.
Packwood span from roughly October 1989 through April of
1990.  On October 18, 1989, Senator Packwood recorded the
following entry:

"I got back and decided to make some inquiries as to whether
I could get Georgie some income...I then called Tim Lee and
said, "Tim, could you somehow put Georgie on retainer for
$10,000?"  They thought they could do that...I did have time
to come back to the office, talk to Tim Lee and Tim says
he'll be happy to put up $10,000 a year for Georgie...."

    Senator Packwood testified that he cannot remember what
he meant by the word "retainer" in the diary entry.  He does
not recall discussing a specific dollar amount with Mr. Lee.
He testified that Mr. Lee was very familiar with his marital
situation and that he had been talking with Mr. Lee about a
job for Mrs. Packwood.  Senator Packwood testified that his
total recollection of discussions with Mr. Lee about jobs
for Mrs. Packwood had "...something to do with antiques and
his wife." Senator Packwood could not recall when they first
started talking about antiques because they n...had talked
about it, obviously before, concerning his wife and things
Georgie was buying.  I can recall taking things out on the
plane that she (Georgie) had bought and taking it out to him
(Lee), things of that nature.  I don't know when we started
talking about antiques and when this occurred.

    Mr. Lee testified that he learned of the Packwood's
separation some time in February or March, 1990, although he
was aware that Senator Packwood had contemplated divorce at
least a year prior to the time of the actual separation.
Mr. Lee does not recall having discussions with Senator
Packwood prior to the time he learned of the separation
about providing any type of financial support for Mrs.
Packwood.

    Mr. Lee testified that he does not recall receiving a
call from Senator Packwood in which the Senator asked him to
put Mrs. Packwood on retainer for $10,000, nor does he
recall ever telling Senator Packwood that he would be happy
to put up $10,000 a year for Mrs. Packwood.  He testified
that the only time that he spoke to Senator Packwood about
compensation for Mrs. Packwood was when Mr. Lee brought up
the antiques business.  He does not recall whether this took
place in October 1989 or March or April of 1990.  He
testified that the subject of income for Mrs. Packwood arose
when Senator Packwood began complaining about the hardships
of a potential divorce in terms of educational expense, for
the children and maintaining two households.  Mr. Lee
responded by bringing up the idea of an antiques business.
Mr. Lee does not recall the Senator requesting or
encouraging him to make job offers to Mrs. Packwood beyond
initiating the conversations that the divorce would be
expensive.

    To the best of his recollection, the first conversation
he had with the Senator about providing income to Mrs.
Packwood did not occur until after Mr. Lee's wife had
returned from an antique buying trip with Mrs. Packwood in
October, 1989.[fn 185] From that time until the date of his
April 14, 1990 letter setting forth the proposal, Mr. Lee
stated that he spoke with Mrs. Packwood about the venture on
two or three occasions.  During one of his conversations
with Mrs. Packwood, she referred to other job offers.  She
indicated that Mr. Lee's offer was one that she would
consider, implying that the others were not.  Mr. Lee kept
Senator Packwood apprised of his conversations with Mrs.
Packwood.   Mr. Lee testified that he made no attempt to
conceal the fact that he was talking to the Senator about
the venture from Mrs. Packwood.

    Mr. Lee testified that although it was not explicit, he
and the Senator understood that the income generated from
the antiques venture for Mrs. Packwood would make it easier
on both of the Packwoods.  He testified that he believed the
job offer was legitimate and potentially lucrative for him.

         b.   3/27/90

    On March 27, 1990, Senator Packwood recorded the
following entry in his diary relating to Mr. Lee:

"...I frankly don't intend this supplement to Georgie to
last more than five years in any event.  I'd also talked
with Tim Lee today to reverify his $10,000 and $10,000 from
Bill Furman for Georgie.  She'll have basically $30,000 to
$40,000 in income for five years so long as I remain in the
Senate."

    With respect to the reference about the supplement to
his wife lasting only five years, Senator Packwood testified
as follows:

"A:  Well, it's kind of like our budget process.  I don't
think I was thinking more than five years down the road and
I thought if I could get her this money for five years--I
didn't mean for it necessarily to end, I just wasn't
thinking beyond five years.

Q:  In the last sentence of that passage, you say, "She'll
have basically $30,000 to $40,000 in income for five years
so long as I remain in the Senate." Was the supplement, as
you refer to it here, conditioned upon your remaining in the
Senate?

A:  No.

Q:  Do you know why you would have used these words?

A:  No, I don't."

    Regarding the reference to Bill Furman, Senator Packwood
testified that at some stage, Mr. Lee approached Mr. Furman
about becoming a partner in the proposed antiques venture.
Senator Packwood testified that he does not recall when he
first spoke to Mr. Furman about the venture.  He stated that
he never directly approached Mr. Furman about the proposal.
When asked what the reference to $10,000 in the diary entry
meant, Senator Packwood testified as follows:

"A:  I can't remember specifically what it refers to, and I
don't know when he pieced together bringing Bill Furman in
and how he was going to make this arrangement on the antique
business.  I can't specifically say what. it refers to, no.

Q:  Do you know in general?

A: No. I'm assuming antique and I'm assuming his business.
At this stage, Lynn [Lee's wife] had been back with us--
this is 1990, isn't it?

Q:  Correct.

A:  Lynn had stayed with us and I  remember Georgie had
lined up a lot of antique shows...And what I remember
specifically was Lynn had bought some things, I think I
recall this, and turned around and sold them in Oregon
rather handsomely, I think.  And I'm thinking this is the
business they're talking about but I can't remember if it's
now.  That's what I recall about the business."

        c.   4/12/90

    On April 12, 1990, Senator Packwood again recorded an
entry involving Mr. Lee and the job offer to Mrs. Packwoods

"...I called Tim Lee because he had left a message which
said he had made the contact.  I got ahold of him and he - 
said he'd spent an hour and a half talking to Georgie...Tim
said he finally thought he made some headway and that she
might be willing to consider a proposal that he had.  I
said, ". . . how are you going to make it legal?"  He said,
"Well, I'm going to suggest I put money into a business
jointly to be run by Lynn (that's his wife) and Georgie.
She would buy antiques and ship them out west and Lynn would
sell them..."  Tim says he'll put the entire $20,000 a year
in himself--enough for Georgie to get $20,000 plus something
extra for Lynn--but what she'll take out is what he would
otherwise give her for an allowance so it's simply a wash.
And he said he'll work out a deal with Bill Furman--some
business arrangement with him-- and Bill will simply give
Tim more money in some kind of a business deal for what he
would otherwise put into the business for Georgie.  God, I'm
glad I don't know this.  I think it's legal allright.  I
would hate for it to get out but I've got that ethics letter
that says what she earns while we're separated is not a
violation of ethics.  Now, I've got Tim and $20,000..."

    When asked about his apparent concern over the legality
of the arrangement, Senator Packwood testified as follows:

"A:  I just wanted to make sure it's legal.  Again, I'm
trying to make sure that everything that's going to happen
here is legal.

Q:  Were you at all concerned or did you have any
information to suggest that it might not be legal?

A:  No.  I didn't have anything.  You asked a lot earlier
but I can't remember the words you used, when we were
talking about the press.  I was trying to bend over back-
wards to make sure that the job offers Georgie got were
legitimate job offers for which she would perform services
for value.  That's what I meant.  I want to make sure
everything is legal.

Q:  Senator, this says, again referring to the sentence we
were just talking about, "I said ... how are you going to
make it legal" as a question, and I'm wondering was it at
all questionable to you?

A:  Again, I don't recall this conversation.  I noticed down
below I say--I think it's legal--I think it's legal
allright.  I don't recall specifically this conversation. I
just recall wanting to make sure :it was all right or things
were allright [sic].  It didn't matter if it was Tim or
[name omitted] or Steve.  I wanted to make sure they were
allright....

Q:  ...You say, "God, I'm glad I don't know this. I think
it's legal allright."  What were you referring to there?

A:  I haven't got the foggiest idea unless it makes
reference to this up above where Tim is saying well, we'll
do something with my business relations to Bill, and then I
say I guess that's legal.  Again, I can't remember any of
this conversation.  I don't even want to know it.  I just
want to make sure what Georgie does, she performs for value
is okay...

Q:  ...do you recall any reason you wouldn't have wanted to
know what their arrangement was?  In other words, this says
"God, I'm glad I don't know this."

A:  I didn't figure so long as what Georgie was going to be
doing was legal, ethical, moral and anything else, I didn't
think it made any difference how Tim worked out his
arrangement with Bill Furman...

Q:  ...you record "I would hate for it to get out;" what do
you mean there?

A:  I don't know what I mean there.  All I know is I
apparently say I guess it's legal, allright.  I don't know
what I mean.  I just want -- I don't want anything that the
press is going to take, that they're going to try to slant
in some way that portrays it as wrong..."

    Mr. Lee does not recall telling Senator Packwood that he
would put up the entire investment himself and that Mr.
Furman would participate by giving him extra business.  Nor
does he recall discussing the legality of the arrangement
with Senator Packwood.  Mr. Lee does not recall having any
concerns about the legality of the proposed venture.  Mr.
Lee recalls telling Senator Packwood that he anticipated
Mrs. Packwood would receive a draw of $20,000.  He intended
for there to be enough money so that both Mrs. Packwood and
his wife would receive at least $20,000 based on some sales
protections he had done.[fn 186]

       d.  4/15/90

    Mr. Lee reduced his proposal to writing in a letter
dated April 14, 1990.[fn 187]  Mr. Lee does not recall
Senator Packwood making any changes to the letter.  In a
diary entry dated April 15, 1990, Senator Packwood recorded
that he had met with Mr. Lee and Mr. Lee showed him the
letter that he was sending to Mrs. Packwood detailing his
proposal for an antiques business. Senator Packwood noted
that Mr. Lee was going to offer Mrs. Packwood $20,000 to
$25,000 a year plus 40% of the net profits and that Bill
Furman was going to put up half of the money. Later the same
day, Senator Packwood recorded an entry in his diary setting
forth the status of his efforts to obtain job offers for his
wife:

"Needless to say it gives me the final hook although I'm
still feeling guilty...but at least: we have the ducks lined
up. [name omitted] at $5,000, Tim Lee and Bill Furman at
$20,000, Steve Saunders at whatever adds to the total of
$25,000 and I'll have Ron Crawford send her a letter that
says, "Georgie, I'd be willing to talk with you about
employment," perhaps having put in the letter in the
magnitude of $7500 a year."

      Senator Packwood testified that as of April 15, 1990,
he thinks he had lined up each of the above individuals to
provide job offers to Mrs. Packwood.

      Mr. Lee testified that either just before or just
after he drafted the letter to Mrs. Packwood, he asked Bill
Furman if he would consider investing in the venture. He
later changed this testimony and stated that he could have
spoken to Mr. Furman about participating as early as October
or November, 1989. Mr. Lee testified that Mr. Furman stated
he would take a look at the proposal and that he thought it
sounded good.[fn 188] Mr. Lee does not recall having any
conversations with Mr. Furman about sources of income for
Mrs. Packwood other than the specific discussion about the
antiques venture. Mr. Lee testified that he went to Mr.
Furman because he was the only individual with whom he had a
personal relationship who might be interested in the venture
and who had the resources to participate.[fn 189] Mr. Lee
stated that he knew Mr. Furman had been a contributor to the
Senator's campaign and that the Senator had been helpful in
some of Mr. Furman's efforts.[fn 190]

     3. Legislative Matters of Interest to Mr. Lee:

      By way of background, Senator Packwood testified that
he is a "deregulatory hawk." He explained that he played a
major role in deregulating the trucking industry in 1980. He
stated that when he became Chairman of the Finance Committee
in 1981, he partially deregulated AT&T in the Senate and it
died because of an antitrust judgment before the House
acted. He explained that he deregulated freight forwarders,
the merchant marine, railroads, buses--"Anything I could
deregulate, I would." He explained that he arranged for Mr.
Lee to testify in 1985 before a subcommittee of the Commerce
Committee because he was having oversight hearings on
whether truck deregulation was working and Mr. Lee was a
"classic example" of the success of deregulation.

       At the time Mr. Lee extended an employment proposal
to Mrs. Packwood in April, 1990, he was the owner of a
trucking brokerage firm, STS, Inc. In June of 1990, the
Supreme Court issued its decision in a case called Maislin
Industries, U.S., Inc., v. Primary Steel,Inc., 497 U.S. 116
(1990)("Maislin").  This decision had specific implications
for Mr. Lee's business. Mr. Lee explained that Maislin
upheld the common carrier doctrine. During this period, a
number of large motor carriers were going out of business.
Maislin allowed the bankrupt carriers to go back to shippers
and bill them for the difference between what they agreed to
charge on a contract basis versus what the common carrier
tariffs stated. Scott Paper Company, one of Mr. Lee's
largest clients, was sued by the trustee of the bankrupt
carrier STS had been using. Although Mr. Lee's company
agreed to hold Scott Paper harmless, Scott was nonetheless
concerned about its future exposure.[fn 191]

    Senator Packwood testified that he does not know if he
ever had discussions with Mr. Lee about the Maislin decision
and its implications for Mr. Lee's business, although he
stated that he n...did not like the Maislin decision.  I
wanted to get rid of the Maislin decision. "  He stated that
Mr. Lee may have asked him to sponsor or cosponsor
legislation to overturn or modify the decision.  Senator
Packwood explained that ". . . lots of people...were asking
us to cosponsor it.  I think all the shippers hated it.
They were going to get stuck with these bankrupt truck
lines' bills, for things they never knew they were
responsible for."  Senator Packwood testified that he did
not have any discussions with Mr. Lee about the job offer
for Mrs. Packwood in connection with or relation to him
sponsoring or cosponsoring legislation that would remedy the
impact of Maislin on Mr. Lee's business.

    On July 30, 1990, the Commerce Committee, chaired by
Senator Exon, passed the Negotiated Rates Equity Act
("NREA"), which would have had the effect of reversing the
Maislin decision. Senator Packwood testified that he does
not know whether he discussed this bill with Mr. Lee or not.
He further testified that there was no connection or
relationship between his vote, either in the Commerce
Committee or on the bill itself, and Mr. Lee's job offer to
Mrs. Packwood.  Senator Packwood Wa8 one of ten co-sponsors
of the bill.  The bill languished in 1990 due to House
inaction and was reintroduced in 1991.  The bill passed the
Senate in 1992, but died again after the House failed to
act. The bill was reintroduced in 1993 and passed.

    Mr. Lee testified that he does not recall ever
discussing Scott Paper's concerns over Maislin with the
Senator.  In fact, he does not recall ever speaking to the
Senator about Maislin or the NREA.  To the extent he talked
with the Senator about legislation, Mr. Lee testified that
their conversations were limited to general comments along
the lines of "deregulation would be good for my business."

    4.   The Status of Mr. Lee's Offer in August. 1990:

    In a letter dated August 1, 1990, Mr. Lee advised
Senator Packwood that Mrs. Packwood had informed him she was
not interested in his proposal at that time.  Mr. Lee wrote
back to her and explained that his offer was '...an open one
and one that you may pursue with me at a time of your
chosing[sic]."[fn 192] Senator Packwood testified that he
does not recall speaking with Mr. Lee about Mrs. Packwood's
response to the job offer.  Nor does he recall whether he
requested Mr. Lee to again offer the job to her or hold the
offer open.  He acknowledged that had Mrs. Packwood accepted
this offer, it would have had a positive financial effect
for her and thus, a positive impact for him, assuming the
judge hearing the divorce case would have considered it.

    Senator Packwood testified that he did not, at any time,
have any discussion with Mr. Lee about the job offer to Mrs.
Packwood in connection with him taking or refraining from
taking any action or position in his capacity as a Senator.
Nor was there any implicit agreement with Mr. Lee about the
job offer in connection with him taking any official action
or position.

    5.   Mrs. Packwood's Testimony:

    Mrs. Packwood testified that she started her antiques
business in 1983 with a friend.  She bought the partnership
in 1984 and has continued on her own since that time.  When
living in Washington, D.C., her activities related to the
antiques business consisted of the following: participating
in antique shows four to twelve times a year; managing a
stall in an antique mall on a fairly consistent basis; and
filling special orders for people who wanted unusual gifts.

    Mrs. Packwood testified that her husband asked her to
have Businessman one's wife stay with them in the fall of
1989 so that Mrs. Packwood could take her antiquing.  She
does not recall discussing with Mr. Lee's wife the
possibility of opening some type of business together.  She
does not believe she has spoken with Mr. Lee's wife since
her visit in the fall of 1989.  She testified that it was
clear to her that whatever  Mr. Lee was doing with respect
to an antiques proposal was separate from his wife.

    Mrs. Packwood testified that she does not recall ever
speaking to Mr. Lee about her antique business prior to late
1989.  Referring to Mr. Lee's reference in the April 14
letter to her son's schooling, she stated that there must
have been some conversation about paying for her son's
education; "I presume when I spoke to him [Mr. Lee] that I
was terribly worried about how to keep my son in school so
he was offering to help the Packwoods out." She does not
recall any specific discussions with Mr. Lee about her
financial situation.  She testified that she told each
person who contacted her on the telephone to put their
Proposal in writing.

    Mrs. Packwood testified that at the time she received
Mr. Lee's proposal, she did not know where she was going or
what she was doing, or how she could take on any kind of
offer of employment. She testified that she did not believe
Mr. Lee's proposal was necessarily an offer of employment
because there was no elaboration of how the proposal would
take place.  The proposal did not seem like "anything solid"
to her.

    Mrs. Packwood testified that she suspected that her
husband was behind Mr. Lee's offer.  In fact, she stated
that Mr. Lee may have indicated that Senator Packwood asked
him to extend the offer, but she does not recall anything
more specific.  She testified that she was disturbed about
the job offers because she thought it was "extremely-cruel
and unethical behavior" to treat a spouse in this way.  She
stated that because Mr. Lee later testified in the divorce
proceedings as a witness for the Senator, she believes that
he did not offer the proposal for her benefit.  She last
remembers speaking with  Mr. Lee during the divorce trial.
There was no mention of the business at that time.  She does
not believe she knows Mr. Furman.

    6.  Summary of Senator Packwood's Response to the
Evidence:

    As in the case of Mr. Saunders, Senator Packwood
testified that Mr. Lee is a longstanding friend who offered
to help when he learned the Packwoods would be separating.
Again, the Senator says he was merely following up on the
offer of assistance.  He asserts that he turned to Mr. Lee
because of their friendship and not for reasons related to
his official position.

    Senator Packwood stated that his total recollection of
discussions with Mr. Lee about jobs for Mrs. Packwood had ".
not recall when they first started talking about the venture
because Mrs. Packwood had been purchasing antiques for Mr.
Lee's wife on an informal basis prior to their discussions
about the venture.

    With respect to his diary entry dated October 18, 1989,
where he records that he asked Mr. Lee to place his wife on
a retainer, Senator Packwood says he cannot remember what he
meant by the word "retainer."  Nor does he recall discussing
a specific dollar amount with Mr. Lee.  With respect to his
diary entry dated March 27, 1990, where he discusses his
contacts with various persons regarding jobs for his wife
and records that his wife will have $30,000 to $40,000 in
income "so long as [he] remains in the Senate," Senator
Packwood denies that the income for his wife was conditioned
upon his remaining in the Senate. Senator Packwood maintains
that the his references to the legality of the proposed
venture are simply expressions of his determination that the
arrangement be legal and do not reflect a concern or
question about the legality of this undertaking.

     Senator Packwood said that he does not know whether he
ever spoke with Mr. Lee about the Supreme Court's decision
in Maislin and its impact on Mr. Lee's livelihood, although
he acknowledged that Mr. Lee may have asked him to sponsor
or cosponsor legislation to overturn or modify the decision.
Similarly, Senator Packwood maintains that he does not know
whether he discussed the NREA with Mr. Lee.  Senator
Packwood denies that there was any connection between his
discussion of the antiques venture or income for his wife
with Mr. Lee and his official actions, including his
position on the NREA.

    7.  Findings:

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood did in
fact solicit or otherwise encourage an offer of personal
financial assistance from Mr. Lee, an individual who,
although not a lobbyist, had a particularized interest in
matters that the Senator could influence.

    Counsel finds that Senator Packwood and Mr. Lee had
conversations about jobs or income for the Senator's wife
during a period when Mr. Lee had a specific and direct
interest in a matter before one of Senator Packwood's
committees.  Although both have testified that Mr. Lee first
extended an offer of help and Senator Packwood then followed
up, the weight of the evidence again suggests that Senator
Packwood's role in encouraging and coordinating job offers
for his wife was significant.  In fact, Ethics Counsel finds
that Senator Packwood's discussions with Mr. Lee about jobs
and income for his wife comprised part of a deliberate and
systematic plan  by the Senator to accumulate approximately
$20,000 in job offers for his spouse in order to reduce his
alimony obligation.

    Additionally, Counsel finds that Mrs. Packwood was not
looking for a job at the time the Senator engaged Mr. Lee in
discussion about providing a job offer to her.

    More specifically, Ethics Counsel finds that although
Mrs. Packwood previously had purchased antiques for Mr.
Lee's wife on an informal basis, the subject of income for
Mrs. Packwood arose only after the Senator began complaining
to Mr. Lee about the hardships of a potential divorce in
terms of educational expenses for the children and the cost
of maintaining two households. Moreover, Ethics Counsel
finds that the Senator's diary entries, recorded nearly
contemporaneously with the events as they occurred, suggest
that the Senator played a more active role than simply
following up with Mr. Lee's offer, as evidenced by the
Senator's use of language such as place on "retainer,"
trying to "get Georgie some income," gaining the "final
hook," and having the "ducks lined up.'   Further, Counsel
finds that the reference in the Senator's diary that his
wife will have an income "supplement" so long as he remains
in the Senate suggests that he may have believed there was a
connection between his ability to encourage job offers for
his wife and his official position.

      Ethics Counsel finds that Mr. Lee and Senator Packwood
did have a longstanding friendship dating back to the time
that Mr. Lee was one of the Senator's employees. Counsel
also finds that throughout his career, Senator Packwood has
consistently advocated deregulation of the trucking industry
and his position with respect to the NREA was consistent
with his deregulatory philosophy.  Notwithstanding this
friendship and Senator Packwood's views on deregulation,
Counsel finds that during the time they were discussing the
antiques venture for Mrs. Packwood, Mr. Lee had a
particularized interest in trying to remedy the impact of
the Supreme Court's decision in Maislin, which had specific
adverse implications for his business.   Counsel also finds
that by virtue of his position on the Committee on Commerce,
Science and Transportation, Senator Packwood was in position
to influence the outcome of this issue.

    Counsel notes that Mr. Lee outlined his proposal to Mrs.
Packwood in writing on April 14, 1990 and then advised her
in writing in August 1990 and again in February 1991 that
his offer remained open.  Counsel also notes that the
Maislin decision was issued in June of 1990 and the NREA
passed the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation
in late July, 1990.  Counsel also notes that Senator
Packwood signed the bill as one of several cosponsors in
September of 1990.  Ethics Counsel further notes that Mr.
Lee testified at the Packwood's divorce trial on behalf of
the Senator in January, 1991, describing his job offer to
Mrs. Packwood.  Counsel finds that Mrs. Packwood never
accepted this offer of employment.


C.   Bill Furman:

      1.   Background:

    Bill Furman is the President of Greenbrier Companies of
Lake Oswego, Oregon.  Greenbrier is in the railcar
manufacturing business through a subsidiary company called
Gunderson, Inc.  It is also in the business of leasing
railcars and intermodal containers and trailers.  Mr. Furman
testified that he first met Senator Packwood in the early
1980's through a mutual acquaintance.

    Mr. Furman has participated in two fundraising events
for Senator Packwood.  The first was the event with
then-President George Bush organized by Mr. Lee in Oregon in
1991.  Greenbrier also cosponsored a fundraising event in
San Francisco earlier the same year (1991).  More than
$50,000 was raised at this event.

    2.   Diary Entries Referring to Mr. Furman, Job Offers
to Mrs. Packwood, Greenbrier's Legislative Interests and
Related Testimony:

         a.   11/8/89

    It appears that the first mention of Mr. Furman in
Senator Packwood's diary in connection with a job offer to
Mrs. Packwood occurred on November 8, 1989 with the
following entry:

"He [Mr. Lee] said that [his wife], in staying with Georgie,
said that two days was enough.  That Georgie just leaned and
leaned and leaned on her and talked about divorce--talked
about [name omitted].  That Georgie is terribly worried
about money...Tim and Bill Furman, the President of
Greenbrier (sp?), are prepared to do anything for Georgie.
Bill says, "What do we need? $40 or $50 thousand year from
me?  Count on it...."

    Senator Packwood testified that he recalls almost
nothing by way of discussions with Mr. Furman about his
involvement in the proposal.  He went on to state that he
does not recall Mr. Furman being involved in the venture
this early in time.  He first recalls Mr. Furman being
involved in the spring of 1990, at the time of Mr. Lee's
letter to Mrs. Packwood.

        b.   11/9/89

    The next diary entry relating to Mr. Furman being
involved in the job offer to Mrs. Packwood is dated November
9, 1989:

"Mike Kelly and I got to the Bill Furman breakfast...And it
was nothing but to thank me for what I had done on Trailer
Train(?)[fn 193] and the investment tax credit--whatever it
was I got for them in the tax reform bill--and of course
Furman has said he'll join Tim Lee in helping keep Georgie
solvent...."[fn [194]

    When asked about this entry, Senator Packwood testified
that he does not remember this conversation.  As to Mr.
Furman's motivation in offering to help his wife, Senator
Packwood responded as follows:

"Q:  ...Was it your understanding that Mr. Furman's
involvement in the job proposal for Mrs. Packwood was as an
expression of gratitude or thanks for what you had done for
his company earlier on?

A:  Well, again, it's funny.  I don't have any recollection
of this conversation either.  This is one and the previous
one, it just does not ring a bell to me at all that it ever
occurred.  Maybe Bill Furman can remember it better, or Tim
if he was there.  But no, I did not assume it would have
been gratitude.  I would like to think  that when you
succeed in helping an Oregon company in keeping it going and
a thousand jobs, that you've succeeded in doing something
that the state appreciates but again, I don't recall this
and I certainly don't recall gratitude.

Q:  In other words, in your mind, was there a connection
between Mr. Furman's appreciation for what you had done for
him and for his company, and his participation in the job
offer for Mrs. Packwood?

A:  No.  My experience with Mr. Furman, and some of it's
more recent, he is a pretty canny businessman and what he
gets into, he gets into it on the assumption he's going to
make money.  I certainly didn't assume it was pure gratitude
for what I had done in keeping the jobs in Oregon."

    With respect to the Trailer Train issue mentioned in the
diary entry, Mr. Furman explained that Trailer Train (now
known as TTX Company) is owned by a large number of
railroads and operates a pool of freight cars in the United
States.  He explained that at the time of the diary entry,
Trailer Train was applying to the ICC for an extension of
its pooling authority. This authority would include
antitrust immunity for purchasing and pooling, enabling the
railroads to collectively pool their purchasing power.
Greenbrier and others in the industry were concerned about
the length of that authority and the power that was being
vested in Trailer Train and thus supported a Department of
Justice ("DOJ") initiative to have a formal hearing at the
ICC to review the extension and approval of authority.

   Greenbrier approached members of the Oregon delegation,
including Senator Packwood, to support the DOJ initiative
and to urge them to write the ICC to request that they
review this matter.  Senator Packwood, as well as other
members of the Oregon delegation, wrote letters supporting
the request for review.  Mr. Furman testified that he met
with Senator Packwood on this issue at least once and the
meeting probably took place in 1987.  The purpose of the
meeting was to familiarize the Senator with the issue and
ask for his support.  He also recalls a breakfast with
Senator Packwood where the subject was discussed.  Mr.
Furman testified that the ultimate outcome of the issue was
difficult to ascertain and did not clearly satisfy any of
the interested parties.  Trailer Train received authority
for pooling, but for a shorter term than they were
requesting and with some limitations.

         c.   4/15/90

    Senator Packwood again recorded a reference to Mr.
Furman in an April 15, 1990 diary entry which refers to a
meeting between Mr. Furman, Mr. Lee and Senator Packwood and
a discussion about the proposal for Mrs. Packwood:

"...Bill Furman is going to put up half the money.  He and
his partner own all of Greenbrier...Tim and I and Bill went
to dinner at Standfords, right across from where their
office is, and Bill told me about a new rail car they're
designing...Anyway, he said, "Bob, there's no quid pro quo.
You've done so much for my company and done so much for this
state and I just want to do anything I can to make your
continued existence in politics possible."  I said, "Well,
this may be the difference in my being able to run for
reelection in 1992 and run for the Presidency in 1996."

    Senator Packwood testified that he does not recall this
conversation with Mr. Furman.  He explained, "...At this
stage, is this an amalgam of my thinking, and this is a
conversation that did not occur or a conversation that
occurred totally differently and I put it in this fashion? I
don't know. I don't recall this conversation...."[fn 195]

    When shown the April 15, 1990 diary entry, Mr. Furman
stated that he recalls having a meeting on a weekend and
going to Stanfords, although he thought it was for lunch,
not dinner.  He does not recall Mr. Lee showing the Senator
a letter referring to the antiques proposal, nor does he
recall any discussion of the proposal.  As to the diary
attributing to him a comment about there being no quid pro
quo, Mr. Furman testified that it would not have been
unusual for him to tell the Senator that he supports him and
that he thinks he has done a good job for Oregon, but these
types of comments would not have been in connection with the
antiques proposal for Mrs. Packwood.  He stressed that he
does not ever recall talking about financing a business for
Mrs. Packwood with the Senator.[fn 196]  Later in his
deposition, he testified that such a conversation with the
Senator did not take place.  He does not recall discussing a
new type of railcar with the Senator, but it would not have
been unusual to describe what his company was doing.

       d.   5/2/90

    Senator Packwood again refers to Mr. Furman in a diary
entry dated MaY 2, 1990:

"Met with Bill Furman, Jim Beale, and [name omitted] who
works for Greenbrier (sp?) in some capacity.  Furman of
course is eternally appreciative to me.  He says that but
for what I did for him in '86 with the transition rules he'd
be out of business.  Now he's prosperous beyond imagination
and gives me the entire  credit.  He's going to put up half
the money Tim Lee's putting up for Georgie's business...."

    Senator Packwood testified that there was no connection
in his mind between Mr. Furman's appreciation or gratitude
for what the Senator had done with the transition rule in
1986 and Mr. Furman's participation in the venture for Mrs.
Packwood.  He does not recall discussing any substantive
legislative matters at this meeting.

    With respect to the May 2, 1990 diary entry, Mr. Furman
testified that he recalls attending a breakfast with the
Senator around that date.  He does not recall discussing the
antiques proposal at this meeting.  He testified that they
had thanked Senator Packwood for his support on a number of
issues in the past, but the references to being "eternally
appreciative" and "prosperity beyond imagination and giving
him the entire credit" is "...not at all anything that we
would have said or did say.' He stated that he does not know
how Senator Packwood could have come away with the
impression that he was involved in financing the proposal,
unless it came from Mr. Lee.  He stated that he never
actually agreed with Mr. Lee to finance a business involving
Mrs. Packwood.

    Regarding the transition rule mentioned in the diary
entry, Mr. Furman explained that in 1986, his company sought
relief from certain provisions of the Tax Reform Act.
Greenbrier had entered into several transactions that
predated the act.  Certain provisions of the act would have
applied retroactively to these transactions and a8 a result,
several large orders would have been cancelled.  Greenbrier
was successful in obtaining a transition rule which
corrected the situation.  Greenbrier's lobbyist testified
that the transition rule was secured by approaching Senator
Packwood and members of his Finance Committee staff and
submitting a proposed transition rule.  Mr. Furman testified
that they were very pleased with the transition rule because
it "...literally saved quite a lot of the jobs...certainly
several hundred people.   Mr. Furman did not meet with
Senator Packwood on this issue, but he did meet with one of
his staffers after the transition rule was obtained to
express his appreciation.

               e.   5/31/91

    On May 31, 1991, Senator Packwood recorded an entry in
his diary describing a meeting with Mr. Furman and another
unidentified person in his office in which Mr. Furman was
asserting that long trucks should be kept off the highways.
Senator Packwood testified that he does not recall any
discussions with Mr. Furman about the long or "giant" truck
issue.  Senator Packwood testified that he did not agree
with Mr. Furman's position on this issue.[fn 197]

    Mr. Furman testified that the long truck or LCV (Long
Combination Vehicle) issue was a major concern for
Greenbrier. Greenbrier was part of a national coalition of
transportation companies involved in rail transportation.
As a member of this coalition of railroad suppliers,
Greenbrier's specific role was to assist the railroad
industry in stopping the proliferation of LCV's on the
highways.  Greenbrier's lobbying firm met with all members
of the Oregon Congressional delegation, including Senator
Packwood, in this effort.  There was eventually legislation
in 1992 that was known as the "iced tea legislation"--the
Intermodal Surface Transportation Act-- which stopped the
proliferation of LCV's.  Mr. Furman met personally with
Senator Packwood on this issue at least once.  Mr. Furman
testified that Senator Packwood was not particularly
helpful.  Mr. Furman described him as "relatively neutral,
looking at both the trucking arguments and the rail
arguments."

    Senator Packwood testified that there was no discussion
with Mr. Furman at any time about the job offer to Mrs.
Packwood in connection with him taking or refraining from
taking any official action.  Nor was there any implicit
understanding or agreement that Senator Packwood would take
some official action in connection with or relation to Mr.
Furman participating in the venture.

      3.   Mr. Furman's Testimony Regarding Mr. Lee:

    In describing his business relationship with Mr. Lee,
Mr. Furman explained that Mr. Lee's company STS was a
railcar customer of Greenbrier.  Greenbrier also leased and
financed railcars for Mr. Lee personally.  Greenbrier
currently has about fifty railcars loaned or leased to Mr.
Lee.  Mr. Furman described Mr. Lee as an important customer.

    Mr. Furman testified that Mr. Lee talked to him about
lending him some money in connection with a business that
his wife was considering in association with Mrs. Packwood.
This conversation took place subsequent to the Packwood's
separation. Mr. Furman does not recall speaking with Mr.
Lee's wife about the proposal.  Mr. Furman testified that
Mr. Lee told him that his wife and Mrs. Packwood had worked
together over the years buying and selling antiques and
would become involved in the antiques business in some way.
Mr. Furman-testified that he does not specifically recall
the amount of money Mr. Lee mentioned, but that $50,000
might be a good approximation of the upper limit.

    Mr. Furman testified that it was his impression that Mr.
Lee was talking about a loan as opposed to an investment.
He stated that Greenbrier had loaned Mr. Lee's company money
on several occasions.  Prior to this time, however, Mr.
Furman does not recall ever making any loans to Mr. Lee that
were unrelated to the trucking business.  Mr. Furman
testified that he responded to Mr. Lee's request by telling
him that it was an interesting proposition and that if Mr.
Lee would prepare some sort of memorandum, he would consider
it.  When asked whether Mr. Lee indicated why Mrs. Packwood
would be involved, Mr. Furman stated that Mr. Lee explained
that he and his wife were good friends with the Packwoods
and that they were concerned about what Mrs. Packwood was
going to do for a living.  There was no indication from his
conversation with Mr. Lee that Mr. Lee's concern about Mrs.
Packwood had originated with Senator Packwood.

    Mr. Lee did not prepare a business plan or any type of
writing on the proposal for Mr. Furman.  Mr. Furman only
recalls discussing this subject with Mr. Lee on one
occasion.  Mr. Furman testified that as far as he was
concerned, the proposal just kind of died.  When asked about
Mr. Lee's April 14, 1990 letter to Mrs. Packwood, Mr. Furman
testified that he had never seen this letter before.  He
testified that he was not aware at the time that Mr. Lee
actually extended any type of proposal to Mrs. Packwood.
Mr. Furman testified that he did not know Mrs. Packwood and
never spoke with her about Mr. Lee's proposal.

      4.  Summary of Senator Packwood's Response to the
Evidence:

    Senator Packwood testified that unlike the other persons
with whom he had discussions about jobs and income for his
wife, Mr. Furman is not a longstanding friend.  The Senator
recalls almost nothing by way of discussions with Mr. Furman
about his involvement in the antiques proposal.  In fact,
Senator Packwood says that Mr. Lee approached Mr. Furman
about participating in the venture without the Senator's
knowledge.  Despite diary entries to the contrary, Senator
Packwood does not recall Mr. Furman being involved in the
venture in November, 1989.  Rather, he does not recall Mr.
Furman being involved until the spring of 1990.

    Moreover, despite several diary entries that appear to
indicate otherwise, Senator Packwood testified that there
was no connection between Mr. Furman's appreciation for what
the Senator had done for his company and his participation
in financing the venture.   In fact, Senator Packwood denies
any connection between any of his official actions and Mr.
Furman's participation in partially financing the antiques
venture for his wife.

      5.  Findings:

    Although the level of direct contact was not as
extensive with Mr. Furman as it was for some of the others
with whom he had discussions about jobs and income for his
wife, Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood did in fact
encourage an offer of personal financial assistance from Mr.
Furman, an individual with particularized interests in
matters that the Senator could influence and in fact, had
influenced in the past.

    Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood and Mr.
Furman were not longstanding friends.  Moreover, Counsel
finds that Senator Packwood did not initiate contact with
Mr. Furman. Rather, Counsel finds that Mr. Furman was
recruited to participate in financing the venture by Mr.
Lee.  Although Counsel notes that Senator Packwood may not
have been aware at the outset that Mr. Lee was going to
enlist the assistance of Mr. Furman, Counsel finds that
Senator Packwood was aware of Mr. Furman's possible
participation as early as November 1989 and that he
acquiesced in this participation.

    Despite his testimony to the contrary, Counsel finds
that the Senator's diary entries, recorded nearly
contemporaneously with the events as they occurred, suggest
that there was at least some connection between Mr. Furman's
participation in financing the venture and the Senator's
official position.  Counsel finds that in discussing Mr.
Furman's willingness to assist in the antiques venture for
his wife, the Senator repeatedly refers to Mr. Furman's
appreciation for official actions taken by the Senator that
benefitted his company.  For example, in his diary entry
dated November 9, 1989, the Senator records that he attended
a breakfast sponsored by Mr. Furman which "..was nothing but
to thank me for what I had done on Trailer Train and the
investment tax credit--whatever it was I got for them in the
tax reform bill--and of course Furman has said he'll join
Tim Lee in helping to keep Georgie solvent...."  In his
diary entry dated April 15, 1990, the Senator records a
meeting among Mr. Lee and Mr. Furman and himself and states
in part that "...Bill Furman is going to put up half the
money..." and Mr. Furman said, "Bob, there's no quid pro
quo.  You've done so much for my company and done so much
for this state and I just want to do anything I can to make
your continued existence in politics possible...."   And, in
a diary entry dated May 2, 1990, the Senator records a
meeting with Mr. Furman and states in part, "Furman of
course is eternally appreciative to me.  He says that but
for what I did for him in '86 with the transition rules he'd
be out of business. Now he's prosperous beyond imagination
and gives me the entire credit.  He's going to put up half
the money Tim Lee's putting up for Georgie's business...."

    Counsel finds that Mr. Furman had specific and direct
interests in a number of legislative matters at various
times that the Senator could influence by virtue of his
positions on the Committee on Finance and the Committee on
Commerce, Science and Transportation, including (but not
limited to) the 1986 transition rule discussed above, the
Trailer Train issue, and the LCV issue .

    Counsel notes that Mr. Furman denies speaking directly
to the Senator about the venture and further denies actually
agreeing to provide the financing.  Counsel, however, is
persuaded to the contrary by the Senator's April 15, 1990
diary entry recording a discussion between the two of them
about the matter, and also by a letter from the Senator to
Mr. Furman dated April 19, 1990 in which the Senator states
in part, "Thanks so much for your all of your help.  I won't
forget it.  Sunday night was delightful..."

    Counsel finds that Mr. Furman did not speak directly to
Mrs. Packwood about his participation.  Counsel further
finds that Mrs. Packwood was not aware of Mr. Furman's
involvement in the venture.


D.   Ron Crawford:

       1.   Background:

    Ron Crawford first met Senator Packwood in 1968 during
the recount of his first election.  Mr. Crawford described
the Senator as one of his best friends.  Mr. Crawford's
consulting business is called F.P. Research Associates and
he is a registered lobbyist.  There is also a fundraising
component to his business, but that is handled by his son.

    In Senator Packwood's 1992 campaign, Mr. Crawford's firm
was involved in raising money from PAC's around the
country.[fn 198] Mr. Crawford has been active in fundraising
in every one of Senator Packwood's campaigns.  In 1991-92,
Senator Packwood's reelection campaign paid Mr. Crawford's
firm approximately $60,000 for fundraising, consulting and
event management.

    Mr. Crawford is a registered lobbyist for the National
Cable Television Association and the American Bus
Association and has been so since the early 1980's.  At the
time of his deposition, he had recently registered as a
lobbyist for the Sturm Ruger Company.  He has a ten year
business relationship with this company.  At the time of hi6
deposition, he also recently had become a lobbyist for the
National Restaurant Association.  He ha6 previously
represented Shell Oil[fn 199], the American Iron and Steel
Institute, General Motors, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturer's
Association[fn 200], Caribbean Marine, and Northrop as a
registered lobbyist.[fn 201]

     2.   Diary Entries Referring to Mr. Crawford and Job
Offers for Mrs. Packwood and Related Testimony:

     a.   10/18/89

    On October 18, 1989, in the context of discussing the
persons he was contacting or contemplating contacting about
income for his wife, Senator Packwood first recorded an
entry in his diary referring to Mr. Crawford and job offers
for his wife:

"...Talked to Ron Crawford.  He'll put up $7500 a year for
Georgie.  That's three out of three and I haven't even hit
up [name omitted] or Steve Saunders..."

    When asked whether he asked Mr. Crawford to extend a job
offer to his wife, Senator Packwood testified that he
believes that Mr. Crawford first broached the subject rather
than him asking Mr. Crawford to extend the job offer.  He
testified that he does not recall the circumstances as to
how this subject arose.  He explained, "This is one of those
where you talk with somebody three and four times a day and
you have dinner with them twice a month and you are so
closely interlinked with them, you can't conceivably recall
who said what when.'  He further stated that he does not
know how they came upon the figure of $7500 a year.

    Mr. Crawford testified that he had discussions with
Senator Packwood about the Senator's concerns about his
children and wife and the political implications of a
separation and divorce a few months before the Senator
separated from Mrs. Packwood in January of 1990.  Mr.
Crawford testified that Senator Packwood may have expressed
concern about the financial impact of a divorce, but he
cannot really recall.  He does recall talking about the
expenses of a divorce with the Senator.

    Mr. Crawford testified that he does not recall Senator
Packwood ever asking him to provide his wife with income or
employment. Rather, he stated that he offered to help Mrs.
Packwood.  He stated that he was concerned for both Senator
and Mrs. Packwood because of the divorce.  He testified that
at the time, he was trying to enhance his master list of
names of contributors by collecting more information about
them so that he would potentially have names available
around the country to assist him in his lobbying efforts.
He testified that he was also trying to think of things that
might be helpful to Mrs. Packwood.  He stated that he knew
things were going to be tough for the Packwoods financially
and this proposal would be a way that she could help him and
he could help her.[fn 202]

     Mr. Crawford testified that he is confident that he
discussed this proposed employment with Senator Packwood,
but he does not recall the circumstances.  He thinks he made
a comment along the lines of: "...well, I've got some stuff
that I'd love to have somebody like Georgie do."   He does
not recall Senator Packwood ever mentioning a specific
amount of money he wanted Mrs. Packwood to earn.  He
testified that Senator Packwood may have come to the $7500 a
year figure because Mr. Crawford must have told him that he
thought Mrs. Packwood could work on a part-time basis and
that [name omitted] could pay her between $400 and $600 a
month.  However, they never got to a point where they
discussed dollars in concrete terms because Mrs. Packwood
never called him back to explore the job offer.  Mr.
Crawford testified that he telephoned Mrs. Packwood on two
or three occasions but did not actually speak to her,
leaving messages on her answering machine. Mr. Crawford
testified that he must have told the Senator that he was
unable to reach Mrs. Packwood and that the Senator may have
suggested that Mr. Crawford write her a letter.

       b.   1/18/90

    Senator Packwood again referred to Mr. Crawford in a
diary entry dated January 18, 1990.  In this entry, Senator
Packwood described the success he had had to date in
obtaining offers of employment for his wife:

"...It's funny.  I hit [name omitted] up.  He says "yes." a
close friend but not as close as Cliff.  The same with
Saunders, same with Ron.  They just say bang, bang, bang--
yes.  But not Cliff.  That means next week I've got to turn
to Saunders and then to Crawford."

    Senator Packwood testified that the discussions about
job offers for his wife did not happen with military-like
precision. He stated, "It was all merging and I was kind of
trying to come up with this total of $20,000 if I could."

       c.   3/27/90

    On March 27, 1990, Senator Packwood again referenced Mr.
Crawford in his diary in connection with a job offer or
income to Mrs. Packwood:

"...Finally Ron Crawford rescued me and we went off to
dinner at the Phoenix Park.  In his usual optimistic fashion
he went over the [Senate] races he thought we would win...I
told him I thought he was unduly optimistic but I thought we
could pick up the Senate in '92.  Crawford goes, "Shit." He
says, "I need the money." I said, "Well, if you're going to
support Georgie in the style to which I'd like her to become
accustomed..." and he laughed.  He says, "Yeah, I'll
guarantee the $7500 for five years. And he said, "If you're
Chairman of the Finance Committee I can probably double
that."  We both laughed.  I don't intend to do that.  I
frankly don't intend this supplement to Georgie to last more
than five years in any event.  I'd also talked to Tim Lee
today to reverify his $10,000 and $10,000 from Bill Furman
for Georgie.  She'll have basically $30,000 to $40,000 in
income for five years so long as I remain in the Senate."

    Senator Packwood testified that Mr. Crawford's job offer
to Mrs. Packwood was in no way conditioned upon or
contingent upon him remaining in the Senate or serving as
Chairman of the Finance Committee.  He explained the above
entry as follows:

"That remark is one between two guys that are drinking and
said in jest in this sense.  You know what happens when
parties change control and all of a sudden all of the
lobbying groups that are Republican, clients come in.  When
the Democrats are in control, the clients go again.  That is
said in jest.  I never had any intention of that.  He didn't
have any intention of that and it was purely a humorous
remark between us.  Again, I want to give the same caveat to
all of these conversations, but I just want to say that we
both laughed...Any of these conversations that have
quotation marks, and especially if I'd been drinking, is
suspect."

     A page from Mr. Crawford's calendar indicates that he
met and had dinner with Senator Packwood on March 27, 1990.
He does not recall any discussion with Senator Packwood on
March 27 about employment or income for Mrs. Packwood.  He
testified that Senator Packwood did not ask him to send a
letter to Mrs. Packwood offering employment and specifying
$7500 a year as income.  Nor does he recall Senator Packwood
ever discussing the $7500 as a figure he hoped Mr. Crawford
would be able to provide. He stated that he was only trying
to help a family that he and his wife loved dearly.

        d.   4/15/90

    Senator Packwood again made reference to Mr. Crawford in
connection with a job offer to his wife in a diary entry
dated April 15, 1990:

"...but at least we have the ducks lined up. [name omitted]
at $5,000, Tim Lee and Bill Furman at $20,000, Steve
Saunders at whatever adds to the total of $25,000 and I'll
have Ron Crawford send her a letter that says 'Georgie, I'd
be willing to talk with you about employment,' perhaps
having put in the letter in the magnitude of $7500 a year."

    Senator Packwood testified that he cannot recall whether
it was his suggestion or recommendation to Mr. Crawford to
reduce his job offer to Mrs. Packwood to writing.  Nor does
he recall whether he suggested any language to go into such
a writing.   In fact, he testified that he is not sure he
ever saw the letter until after it was sent.

       e.   6/6/90

    On June 6, 1990, Senator Packwood recorded in his diary
another contact with Mr. Crawford involving the job offer to
his wife:

"Had a phone call with Ron Crawford and I told him to
re-call Georgie and make the offer..."

    Senator Packwood testified that he may have mentioned an
offer from Mr. Crawford to his wife and she indicated that
she preferred not to talk to him.  The Senator testified
that he does not believe Mrs. Packwood and Mr. Crawford ever
actually communicated.

    Mr. Crawford testified that he had never previously
spoken with Mrs. Packwood about working for him.  Nor had
she ever expressed an interest in working with his firm.
Mr. Crawford testified that Senator Packwood did not ask him
to go back again and try to contact her when she did not
respond.  Mr. Crawford does not recall any discussions with
the Senator after he advised him that he had not heard from
Mrs. Packwood.  He testified that his offer of employment
was to help Mrs. Packwood.  He did not have any discussions
with Senator Packwood about whether the job offer would help
him as well.

    The evidence indicates that Mr. Crawford did, in fact,
send a letter to Mrs. Packwood dated June 13, 1990.  In this
letter, Mr. Crawford indicated that he wanted to "...discuss
what I believe could be several business opportunities that
you might be interested in."  Although his letter mentions
"several business opportunities," Mr. Crawford testified
there was only one. He never received a response from Mrs.
Packwood and he has not spoken to her since before the
divorce.  When asked what his understanding was of the
nature of the job being offered by Mr. ~Crawford.  Senator
Packwood explained that his wife had a great political
background in that she had managed his 1962 and 1964
legislative campaigns and travelled around the state with
him in 1968, 1974 and 1980.  He testified that he believes
she would have been a great consultant or campaign manager.

      3.   Legislative Matters of Interest to Mr. Crawford: 


          a.   Cable Regulation:

    Regarding specific legislative matters of interest to
Mr. Crawford's clients, a Commerce Committee vote took place
on June 7, 1990 to re-regulate the cable industry, six days
before Mr. Crawford sent his written employment proposal to
Mrs. Packwood. Senator Packwood cast the lone dissenting
vote on this bill.  In explaining this situation, Senator
Packwood testified as follows:

"[It was] ... an outrageous, foolish bill...My staffer wrote
the bill, the Cable Deregulation Act of 1984.  And over
fierce opposition, we deregulated cable prices and we said
in exchange to cable what we want is more channels and
better programming.  And we got it in spades and then this
damn bill came along to re-regulate it.  It was a step
backward.  I hope we undo it.  I'm going to try and undo it.
And that is the background of that vote."

    He testified that he never had any discussions with Mr.
Crawford about the job offer to Mrs. Packwood in connection
with his position on this piece of legislation, which he
described as "adamant."  Mr. Crawford testified that he may
or may not have spoken to Senator Packwood about this bill,
but he stated that he seldom talked to Senator Packwood on
cable issues because for the most part, he knew where the
Senator was coming from.

    On September 27, 1990, Senator Packwood noted in his
diary that Mr. Crawford was in to see him with a
representative of the cable industry.  The Senator recorded
that they wanted his advice as to whether they should let a
cable bill come up for consideration or attempt to stop it.
Senator Packwood noted that he advised them to try and stop
it.  Senator Packwood testified that he does not recall any
discussion with Mr. Crawford at this time about the status
of the job offer.  He further testified that he did not need
to be lobbied on this matter because the cable industry's
position was identical to his.  He explained that this was a
re-regulatory bill and that he and others wanted to
filibuster it to the end of the session if possible.  He
testified that he cannot recall whether they held the bill
or it came up, although he was successful in eventually
killing the bill.

      b.   The Gun Lobby:

    Later in the September 27, 1990 diary entry referenced
above, Senator Packwood recorded that Mr. Crawford stayed on
to discuss the National Rifle Association.  He noted that,
"...Ron is big, big with the National Rifle Association."
Senator Packwood testified that he meant that Mr. Crawford
is active in the NRA and "owns a lot of guns."  He stated
that he does not think Mr. Crawford represents the NRA.  Mr.
Crawford testified that he does not do work for the NRA,
although "he talks to them intermittently."

    Senator Packwood testified that Mr. Crawford brought the
issue of exempting custom gunsmiths from a firearms excise
tax on behalf of the NRA to his attention.  Staff memos
indicate that Senator Packwood and his staff focused on this
issue between February and April, 1991.  In April of 1991,
Senator Packwood introduced a bill exempting custom
gunsmiths who make less than 50 firearms per year from the
firearms excise tax.  Senator Packwood testified that there
was never any discussion with Mr. Crawford about the job
offer to Mrs. Packwood in connection with his position on
this particular piece of legislation.

       c.   Miscellaneous:

    Mr. Crawford testified that in the 1989-90 time period,
his client the American Bus Association was concerned with
the three cent diesel fuel tax exemption.  His only contact
with Senator Packwood or his staff on this issue would have
been to simply confirm that it was not a problem.  His
client the American Iron and Steel Institute was interested
in the issue of voluntary restraints in 1989-90.  Senator
Packwood opposed their position. Mr. Crawford does not
recall meeting with Senator Packwood on this issue, although
he did meet with staff.

     4.   Appointment of Mr. Crawford's Wife to the ITC:

      In addition, Senator Packwood played a major role in
helping Mr. Crawford's wife, Carol Crawford, become
appointed to the International Trade Commission in 1991.
Senator Packwood testified that he was her primary supporter
in her bid to become a member of the ITC.  When asked
whether there was ever any discussion with either Mr.
Crawford or his wife about his support for her for the ITC
position in connection with Mr. Crawford extending a job
offer to Mrs. Packwood, Senator Packwood testified, "There
never is any linkage at any time in my dealings with Ron or
Carol and a job for Georgie."

        5.   Mrs. Packwood's Testimony:

    Mrs. Packwood testified that she and Senator Packwood
had been friends with Mr. Crawford and his wife in the past,
although Senator Packwood saw them much more frequently than
she did.  She testified that she did not return any of Mr.
Crawford's telephone calls and never had any discussion with
him about his proposal. She learned why Mr. Crawford was
calling from her husband.  She stated that she would not
have been interested in business opportunities with him
unless they involved her "already in place" antique
business.  Mrs. Packwood explained that she felt very
uncomfortable with the whole situation, particularly with
Mr. Crawford and his wife, because she believed they had
been "aiding and abetting" the break-up with her husband.
As a result, she did not want to have anything to do with
Mr. Crawford, who she did not regard as a friend.

     6.  Summary of Senator Packwood's Response to the
Evidence:

    Senator Packwood asserts that Mr. Crawford is an old
friend who first broached the subject of extending a job
offer to his wife.  The Senator maintains that he was merely
following up on Mr. Crawford's offer of assistance when he
discussed jobs and income for Mrs. Packwood.  He states he
does not recall the circumstances as to how this subject
arose.  He testified he turned to Mr. Crawford because of
their longstanding friendship and not for reasons related to
his official position.

    With respect to his October 18, 1989 diary entry where
he records that Mr. Crawford will "put up" $7500 a year for
his wife, Senator Packwood claims he does not know who said
what when with respect to the job offer for Mrs. Packwood.
He contends that he does not know how they arrived at the
figure of $7500 a year.  With respect to his March 27, 1990
diary entry where he records that his wife will have $30,000
to $40,000 in income for five years from the offers he has
secured "so long as I remain in the Senate," Senator
Packwood claims that Mr. Crawford's job offer was in no way
conditioned upon or contingent upon him remaining in the
Senate or serving as Chairman of the Committee on Finance.

    Regarding his April 15, 1990 diary entry where he
records that he will have Mr. Crawford send his wife a
letter about employment, Senator Packwood maintains that he
does not recall whether he suggested that Mr. Crawford
reduce his job offer to writing.  Other than Mr. Crawford's
June 13, 1990 letter to Mrs. Packwood in which he invites
her to explore "business opportunities" with him, Senator
Packwood does not believe Mr. Crawford and his wife actually
spoke about Mr. Crawford's job offer.

    Senator Packwood notes that his lone dissenting vote on
a bill before the Committee on Commerce, Science and
Transportation to re-regulate the cable industry six days
before Mr. Crawford sent hi6 written employment proposal to
Mrs. Packwood was entirely consistent with his deregulatory
philosophy and his earlier positions with respect to
deregulation of the cable industry.  He asserts that he
never had any discussions with Mr. Crawford about the job
offer to Mrs. Packwood in connection with his position on
matters affecting the cable industry.  Similarly, he states
that he never had any discussion with Mr. Crawford about the
job offer to Mrs. Packwood in connection with his bill to
exempt custom gunsmiths from a firearms excise tax in 1991,
although he acknowledges that Mr. Crawford brought this
issue to his attention.  Additionally, although he
acknowledges that he was the primary supporter of Mr.
Crawford's wife in her bid to become a member of the ITC,
Senator Packwood denies any linkage between his support of
her and the job offer to his wife.

    7.  Findings:

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood did in
fact solicit or otherwise encourage an offer of- personal
financial assistance from Mr. Crawford, an individual
representing clients with particularized interests in
matters that the Senator could influence.

    Counsel finds that Senator Packwood and Mr. Crawford
conducted discussions about jobs and income for Mrs.
Packwood at a time when Mr. Crawford was representing
clients with specific and direct interests in matters that
Senator Packwood could influence by virtue of his positions
on the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and
the Committee on Finance.  Although both have testified that
Mr. Crawford first offered to help and Senator Packwood then
followed up, the weight of the evidence suggests that
Senator Packwood's role in encouraging and coordinating job
offers for his wife was significant.  In fact, Ethics
Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's discussions with Mr.
Crawford about job offers and income for his wife comprised
part of a deliberate and systematic plan by the Senator to
accumulate approximately $20,000 in job offers for his
spouse in an attempt to reduce his alimony obligation.
Additionally, Counsel finds that Mrs. Packwood was not
looking for a job at the time the Senator engaged Mr.
Crawford in discussion about providing a job offer to her.

    Ethics Counsel finds that Mr. Crawford's offer of
assistance was extended after the Senator expressed concern
about the costs associated with a divorce.  Moreover,
Counsel finds that the Senator's diary entries, recorded
nearly contemporaneously with the events as they occurred,
suggest that the Senator played a more active role than
simply following up with Mr. Crawford, as evidenced by the
Senator's use of language such as "hit up," "accept the
offers that I've solicited," instructing Mr. Crawford to
"...re-call Georgie and make the offer," and "I'll have Ron
Crawford send her a letter...  about employment.

    Ethics Counsel finds that Mr. Crawford and Senator
Packwood did have a longstanding friendship dating back to
1969. Notwithstanding this friendship, Counsel finds that at
the time they were discussing job offers and income for Mrs.
Packwood, Mr. Crawford was representing a number of
entities, including the National Cable Television
Association, with particular interests in matters that the
Senator could influence.  Counsel notes that Senator
Packwood has consistently supported deregulation of the
cable industry and that his vote in June of 1990 was
entirely consistent with his deregulatory philosophy.

    Moreover, despite their friendship, Counsel finds that
there '6 evidence to suggest that there was some connection
between Senator Packwood's official position and his
relationship with Mr. Crawford.  For example, in a diary
entry dated October 8, 1991, Senator Packwood records, "The
advantage Ron brings to me in the Washington PAC scene is
that much of his income is dependent upon his relationship
with me."  In an entry dated July 11, 1990, he records
"...Ron wanted me to meet with them because they want to
retain Ron because, as Ron says, "People hear that you're
tough to get to and they know I can get to you."  On March
27, 1990, while discussing the job offers he had coordinated
for his wife, the Senator recorded that his wife would have
an income "supplement" so long "as I remain in the Senate."
And, on September 13, 1989, Senator Packwood recorded the
following conversation when Mr. Crawford was in to see him
on behalf of a client:  "He [Crawford] said, "I know how
much you hate the oil companies."  I said, "Ron, I still
hate the oil companies but I'll do you a favor."

    Counsel finds that Mr. Crawford extended his offer of
employment in writing to Mrs. Packwood in a letter dated
June 13, 1990.  Counsel further finds that Mrs. Packwood did
not accept the offer.

E.   Clifford Alexander:

1.   Background:

    Clifford Alexander is the president of a corporate
consulting firm.  He stated that his firm's work principally
involves work force inclusiveness or increasing
opportunities in the work force for minorities and women.
His firm also performs lobbying in a number of different
areas.  Another aspect of the services provided by his firm
is corporate social responsibility. He first met the
Packwoods twenty-five years ago.  They became close friends
and he and his wife have continued their relationship with
Mrs. Packwood.  The same is not true with the Senator.
coinciding with the time of the Packwood's separation.

2.   Diary Entry Referring to Mr. Alexander and Job Offers
for Mrs. Packwood and Related Testimony:

       a.   1/18/90

    On January 18, 1990, Senator Packwood recorded the
following entry in his diary relating to Mr. Alexander and a
job for his wife:

"A quick lunch with Cliff.  It was a nice friendly lunch.
He said, "Is there anything I can do?" I hit him up to give
a job to Georgie, but he said, "Gosh, we've got that ICI
client.  It wouldn't look good."  I said, "It doesn't matter
if we're separated."  Well, Cliff said...and this was after
he was bragging about all the money he had, how much they're
making, how much he's setting aside, what kind of trust he
has for the kids and that he needs to work five more years
until he can retire comfortably on his investments and
income for the rest of his life, but not enough money for
Georgie.  It's funny.  I hit [name omitted] up. He says
'yes.' [name omitted] a close friend but not as close as
Cliff.  The same with Saunders, same with Ron.  They just
say bang, bang bang--yes.  But not Cliff. That means next
week I've got to turn to Saunders and then to Crawford."

    Senator Packwood testified that he recalls telling Mr.
Alexander and his wife that he had separated.  He stated
that he recalls talking to Mr. Alexander about providing a
job offer to Mrs. Packwood.  In this regard, the Senator
testified that in this particular case, ". . . I approached
him if he could be of some help.   When asked whether his
conversation with Mr. Alexander proceeded along the lines
described in the diary entry, Senator Packwood testified as
follows:

"A:  I don't remember his reference to ICI.  What I
remember, and I was kind of disappointed because he
had--Cliff is a wonderful guy and a buoyant guy, and from
time to time he would tell me how successful he was
doing...And he was making very good money, and we were close
friends and I remember I was disappointed when he said he
couldn't help. Do I remember this specific conversation?
No.  Do I remember the ICI reference? No. But I remember I
was kind of hurt by it.

Q:  Put you do recall asking him to provide a job for Mrs.
Packwood; is that correct?

A:  Yes.  I guess I would have thought of all the people I
could go to that was close, close friends that could have
helped, it would have been Cliff.

Q:  Do you recall what his response was?

A:  Well, I don't recall him--I see ICI here.  I don't
remember him mentioning that.  I just remember the hurt when
he couldn't do it--wouldn't do it.

Q:  But you don't recall a specific reason or explanation
that he offered as to why he couldn't do it?

A:  No."

      3.   Mr. Alexander's Testimony

    Mr. Alexander testified that he learned of the
Packwood's separation some time in 1990.  Regarding the
January 18, 1990 diary entry, Mr. Alexander testified that
he does not recall having lunch with the Senator.  He does
not recall Senator Packwood asking him to provide a job to
his wife, although he said this could have happened.  He
stated that had there been a need,-Mrs. Packwood would have
approached him directly.  He stated that he would not have
mentioned the ICI client in the way noted in the diary.
Instead, he would have simply said no.  Mr. Alexander does
not recall talking to the Senator about a trust for his
children and the fact that he needed to work five more years
until he could comfortably retire.  In fact, he testified
that he does not have any trusts set up for his children and
he does not plan to retire.  He does not recall any
discussion with Senator Packwood in which the Senator
indicated that it would help their financial situation if
his wife were able to find a job.  He testified that he
never helped find her a job.

    Mr. Alexander testified that he does not recall any
other occasion when Senator Packwood said anything about his
wife needing a job.  He stated that Mrs. Packwood did
mention that she had been approached about employment, but
he does not recall any names she may have mentioned.  He
testified that there may have been discussions with her
about Senator Packwood's role in persons approaching her
about job opportunities, but he does not recall any
specifics.

       4. Legislative Matters of Interest to Mr. Alexander:

    During the 1989 to 1991 time period, Mr. Alexander was
retained by the Investment Company Institute ("ICI"), the
national trade association for the mutual fund industry, to
advance ICI's position on several legislative matters.  Some
of these matters included securing permanent repeal of the
2% floor on miscellaneous itemized business deductions;
securing repeal of the 30/30 rule that applied to mutual
funds  and opposing the Securities Transfer Excise Tax
("STET").  Mr. Alexander testified that he communicated with
Senator Packwood or his Finance Committee staff on a number
of occasions during the 1989-1991 time period in order to
advocate ICI's position on these issues.

       5.   Mrs. Packwood's Testimony:

    Mrs. Packwood testified that she never had any
indication from Mr. Alexander that he had been asked by the
Senator to try and find her some type of employment.

       6.  Summary of Senator Packwood's Response to the
Evidence:

     Senator Packwood's response to the evidence related to
his contact with Mr. Alexander is unique in that this is the
only case where Senator Packwood admits that he initiated
the request for help as opposed to following up on an offer
of assistance. Here, Senator Packwood acknowledges that he
approached Mr. Alexander to see if he might be able to help
with a job for his wife.  Senator Packwood notes that Mr.
Alexander was an old and good friend.

    With respect to his January 18, 1990 diary entry in
which he records that he had lunch with Mr. Alexander and
"hit him up to give a job to Georgie," Senator Packwood
recalls telling Mr. Alexander that he had separated from his
wife and he recalls talking with him about providing a job
offer for Mrs. Packwood. He recalls asking Mr. Alexander to
provide a job for Mrs. Packwood and being disappointed and
hurt when his close friend refused to help.  The Senator
does not recall Mr. Alexander making mention of the
appearance problem that might be created because of his
representation of a client called ICI.

      7.  Findings:

    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood did in
fact solicit or otherwise encourage an offer of personal
financial assistance from Mr. Alexander, an individual
representing a client with particularized interests in
matters that the Senator could influence.

    Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's discussion with
Mr. Alexander about job offers for his wife comprised part
of a deliberate and systematic plan to accumulate
approximately $20,000 in job offers for his spouse in an
attempt to reduce his alimony obligation.  Counsel also
finds that Mrs. Packwood was not looking for a job at the
time Senator Packwood asked Mr. Alexander to provide a job
offer to her.

    Counsel finds that Mr. Alexander and Senator Packwood
did have a longstanding friendship dating back to the time
that the Senator arrived in Washington, D.C.
Notwithstanding this friendship, Counsel finds that at the
time Senator Packwood requested Mr. Alexander to provide a
job offer to his wife, Mr. Alexander was representing ICI, a
client who had specific and direct interests in matters that
the Senator could influence by virtue of his position on the
Committee on Finance.  More specifically, ICI had a
particular interest in issues such as the STET, the 30/30
rule, and final repeal of the 2% floor on miscellaneous
itemized deductions.  Further, Counsel finds that there is
evidence in the Senator's January 18, 1990 diary entry to
suggest that Mr. Alexander raised the potential appearance
problem caused by his representation of ICI with the Senator
and that the Senator dismissed this concern.

    Counsel finds that Mr. Alexander never extended an offer
of employment or income to Mrs. Packwood.  Counsel further
finds that Mrs. Packwood was not aware that the Senator had
requested Mr. Alexander to provide her employment.  Counsel
notes that Mr. Alexander does not recall the Senator asking
him to provide a job to his wife, although he admits the
possibility of such a request.


F.  Further Findings Regarding Solicitation of Jobs

     Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's efforts to obtain
employment for his estranged spouse in an attempt to reduce
any future alimony payment did not involve any quid pro quo
and that he did not agree to receive or accept any financial
benefit "for or because of any official act."  As is clear
from Senate precedent, however, conduct which does not rise
to such an egregious level may, nonetheless, be improper.

    With respect to his contacts concerning possible
employment of his spouse with the five individuals discussed
above, Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood
engaged in a series of interconnected activities which
linked his personal financial gain to his position as a
United States Senator.

    Counsel also finds that, notwithstanding the willingness
of friends to be of assistance, Senator Packwood's role in
encouraging and coordinating job offers for his wife was the
predominant force responsible for such offers in this case.
Counsel further finds that Senator Packwood conceived of,
undertook and executed a deliberate and systematic plan to
enhance his personal financial position in a manner which
was greatly reliant for its success upon his position as a
United States Senator and the legislative interests of those
whom he solicited or encouraged.  In this regard, Counsel
notes the power inherent in the position of a United States
Senator and the natural desire of persons and groups with
substantial interests in legislation to have access to and
ingratiate themselves with those whose decisions can
significantly affect those interests.

    Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's conduct in
these activities reflects an abuse of his United States
Senate office and constitutes improper conduct which ha6
brought discredit upon the Senate.


VII. FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS AS NOTICED AND SPECIFIED IN THE
COMMITTEE'S RESOLUTION

    As to the violations noticed in the Committee's
Resolution of May 16, 1995, Senate Ethics Counsel
incorporates the findings set forth in Sections IV, V, and
VI, above, as summarized below:

    A.   Senator Packwood abused his United States Senate
office by improper conduct which has brought discredit upon
the United States Senate, by engaging in a pattern of sexual
misconduct between 1969 and 1990.

    B.   Senator Packwood engaged in improper conduct which
has brought discredit upon the United States Senate, by
intentionally altering diary materials that he knew or
should have known the Committee had sought or would likely
seek as part of its investigation.

    C.   Senator Packwood abused his United States Senate
office and engaged in improper conduct which has brought
discredit upon the United States Senate, by inappropriately
linking personal financial gain to his official position, in
that he solicited or otherwise encouraged offers of
financial assistance from five persons who had a particular
interest in legislation or issues that he could influence.

what he meant by "laying to rest the Fusion problem,"
Senator Packwood testified that,"... I wasn't going to let
him [Spero] use the hearing process to try to get us to
force the Japanese to give him something that he didn't
deserve.  I had hoped I guess on this day that we had
finally killed it."  In a background memo for this hearing
dated February 27, 1989, one of the Senator's staffers notes
that Senator Packwood was "brought into this issue by Steve
Saunders, on behalf of Mitsubishi."

179.  Senator Packwood testified that he is not sure what he

before the Committee, Senator Packwood again referred to Mr.
Quinn's advice and stated that Mr. Quinn had provided him a
memo on the subject.  Mr. Quinn's correspondence and
accompanying memo to the Senator are dated June 25, 1990.
Senator Packwood also initially suggested that he might have
discussed the subject with Mr. Wilson Abney, formerly of the
Senate Ethics Committee staff.  He later clarified that he
did not have any discussion with Mr. Abney about the job
offers for Mrs. Packwood, although he did have discussions
with him about the filing requirements if he and his wife
were living separately but still married.  This testimony is
supported by an entry in his diary dated January 24, 1990
and an exchange of correspondence dated January 25 and
February 6, 1990, respectively.

information about gratuities, bribery and gifts.   Mr.
Quinn's correspondence to the Senator is dated June 25,
1990, after the Senator had already coordinated the job
offers for his wife.  Moreover, in his letter, Mr. Quinn
states that he needs to do more research and thinking on the
subject.  He then cautions, "In the facts at hand, we have
to be concerned with the coincidence of your influence over
financial opportunities made available to Georgie and the
fact that there is an indirect benefit from them to you."

185.  Mr. Lee testified that prior to his wife's October
1989 trip with Mrs. Packwood, there had been general off and
on conversations for years between him and his wife about
"...doing something in antiques involving Georgie.

business.  Mr. Lee does not recall discussing the details of
his April 14 proposal with his wife.

187.  Senator Packwood testified that he cannot remember
whether he suggested that Mr. Lee reduce his proposal to
Mrs. Packwood to writing.

entry in his diary that Mr. Crawford was in to see him on
behalf of Shell Oil.  He noted the following conversation:
"He [Crawford] said, 'I know how much you hate the oil
companies.'  I said, '... I still hate the oil companies but
I'll do you a favor."  Senator Packwood testified that

to do something anyway, you let them think it's a big
favor."

200.  On July 11, 1990, Senator Packwood recorded in his
diary that two representatives of Abbott were into see him

Senator Packwood testified that he is delighted to see Mr.
Crawford's clients because Mr. Crawford does not mislead
him.

201. Mr. Crawford recalls two issues of interest to
Northrop:  1) the sale of F-20 aircraft to Jordan and 2)

<P>On Aug. 22, 1992, on a remote ridge in northern Idaho, a weeklong standoff between white supremacist Randy Weaver and federal agents ended in a shootout in which an FBI sniper shot and killed Weaver's wife, Vicky. The Ruby Ridge confrontation began a week earlier when federal marshals tried to arrest Weaver for failing to appear in court on weapons charges. At that time, a gun battle erupted between marshals and Weaver's 14-year-old son, resulting in the deaths of Weaver's son and a marshal.</P>

<P>The incident led to one of the most intensive internal reviews of an FBI investigation ever. Attorney General Janet Reno established a Justice Department task force to investigate the events at Ruby Ridge. The task force concluded in a 1994 report that the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team overreacted to the threat of violence and instituted a shoot-on-sight policy that violated bureau guidelines and Fourth Amendment restrictions on police power. The FBI disciplined 12 agents and employees, including Larry Potts, then the head of its criminal division and now its deputy director, for their roles in the operation.</P>

<P>The following document, which is contained in the attached files, is the full text of the task force's unreleased 542-page report, which was obtained by Legal Times.</P>

<P>In the hard copy of this document, some material has been deleted and marked by the word "Garrity," apparently referring to U.S. Supreme Court opinion Garrity v. New Jersey (1967). Under Garrity, government employees must be granted immunity from criminal prosecution if they provide information during an administrative investigation.</P>

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

REPORT ON INTERNAL REVIEW REGARDING
THE RUBY RIDGE HOSTAGE SITUATION AND 
SHOOTINGS BY LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL

 I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

  A. Overview

  In February 1993, the Office of Professional
Responsibility ("OPR") of the U.S. Department of Justice (the
"Department") was informed of allegations made by defense
counsel for Randall ("Randy") Weaver and Kevin Harris in the
criminal case of United States v. Weaver which was pending in
the federal district court in Idaho. Defense counsel alleged
that employees of several components of the Department had
engaged in criminal and professional misconduct during the
investigation, apprehension, and prosecution of Randy Weaver and
Kevin Harris. The Department decided to defer action on this
matter until the criminal trial was completed.

  In July 1993, a jury acquitted Weaver and Harris of
charges stemming from the murder of a federal officer. 
Following the acquittal, numerous additional allegations were
raised by defense counsel an other sources against the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms ("BATF"), the U.S. Marshals
Service ("Marshals Service") , the Federal Bureau of
Investigation ("FBI" or "Bureau") and the U.S> Attorney's Office
for the District of Idaho ("USAO"). Included among these
allegations were claims that Department employees had unlawfully
caused the deaths of Sammy and Vicki Weaver, had taken actions
that had obstructed justice, had committed perjury and had
engaged in other criminal and ethical misconduct. In late July
1993, attorneys from OPR and the Criminal Division of the
Department, assisted by inspectors form the FBI, began an
investigation of these allegations.

  This report details the results of this investigation and
traces chronologically the events that occurred in the Weaver
matter. The early sections of the report focus on Weaver's 
sale of illegal firearms to a BATF informant, BATF's
unsuccessful attempt to enlist Weaver as an informant, the
subsequent governmental delay in seeking an indictment on the
firearms violations, and Weaver's arrest on weapons charges
followed by his subsequent failure to appear for trial on those
charges. Another area of investigative inquiry focuses on the
efforts of the Marshals Service to apprehend Weaver. These
efforts culminated in the August 21, 1992 gun battle at Ruby
Ridge which took the lives of Deputy Marshal William Degan and
Weaver's son, Sammy Weaver. Next, the report contains a
discussion of the involvement of the FBI in the Weaver matter,
including its initial intervention in the crisis, its
responsibility for the death of Vicki Weaver and wounding of
Kevin Harris on August 22, 1992, its handling of the crisis
including its attempts to end the week-long standoff, its
handling of the crime scene searches and its subsequent
activities in assisting the USAO in preparing the Weaver case
for trial. Finally, the last section of the report addresses
the handling by the USAO and the investigative agencies of the
prosecution of Weaver and Harris including representation made
by the U.S. Attorney to the court prior to the beginning of
Harris' preliminary hearing, the conduct of the Assistant U.S.
Attorney before the grand jury and the untimely disclosure of
critical information to the defense.

  We found that many of the allegations of misconduct were
not supported by the evidence. However, we did find merit in
some of the more serious charges. As a result, we have asked
that the appropriate component of the Department examine for
prosecutive merit the conduct of the FBI sniper/observer who
fired the shots on August 22, 1992. In addition, because our
investigation indicated that Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald
Howen took certain questionable actions during the investigation
and prosecution of the Weaver case, we have recommended that th
Executive Office for United States Attorneys examine our
analysis of his conduct and take whatever administrative action
it deems appropriate. Finally, we have formulated a series of
recommendations that address the problems that we reviewed or
uncovered during our investigation.

  B. Significant Findings

  In October 1989, Randy Weaver sold illegal weapons to a
BATF informant. When BATF agents later attempted to enlist
Weaver as an informant in their investigation of the Aryan
Nations, Weaver refused to cooperate. Seven months later, the
government indicted Weaver for the illegal weapons sales. We
have found no evidence to support the claim that BATF targeted
Weaver because of his religious or political beliefs. 
Similarly, we found insufficient evidence to sustain the charge
that Weaver was illegally entrapped into selling the weapons.

  When Weaver was arraigned on the weapons charges in
January 1991, he was told that his trial would commence on
February 19, 1991. Two weeks later, the court clerk notified
the parties that the trial date had been changed to February 20,
1991. Shortly thereafter, the U.S. Probation Office sent Weaver
a letter which incorrectly referenced his trial date as March
20, 1991. After Weaver failed to appear for trial on February
20, the court issued a bench warrant for his arrest. THree
weeks later, on March 14, a federal grand jury indicted Weaver
for his failure to appear for trial. We found that: the
government, especially the USAO, was unnecessarily rigid in its
approach to the issues created by the erroneous letter; that the
USAO improvidently sought an indictment before March 20, 1991;

 
[G.J.]

  From February 1991 through August 1992, the Marshals
Service was involved in efforts to apprehend Weaver to stand
trial for the weapons charges and for his failure to appear for
trial. These efforts included gathering information about
Weaver and developing a plan to arrest him. Base on information
that it collected, the Marshals Service learned that for many
years Weaver had made statements about his intent to violently
confront federal law enforcement officials. As a result, the
Marshals Service concluded that Weaver intended to resist
violently governmental attempts to arrest him. Thereafter, the
Marshals Service investigated and carefully considered
alternatives that would enable it to arrest Weaver without
endangering his family or law enforcement personnel. It
concluded that an undercover operation would be the most prudent
way to proceed.

  In August 1992, six marshals travelled to an area in
northern Idaho known as Ruby Ridge to conduct surveillance of
the Weaver residence in preparation for the undercover
operation. During the surveillance mission, the Weaver dog
discovered the marshals and began to bark. The marshals
retreated with the dog, Harris, Randy Weaver and his son, Sammy
Weaver, and other family members in pursuit. At an area known
as the "Y," a gun battle occurred in which Deputy Marshal Degan
and Sammy Weaver were killed.

  We conclude that the marshals took a measured approach in
developing a plan to apprehend Weaver. Throughout the 18 month
period that the marshals were responsible for apprehending
Weaver, they carefully devised a plan intended to pose the least
amount of risk to Weaver, his family, and the marshals. At no
time did we find that it was the intent of the marshals to force
a confrontation with Weaver or his family. Although some may
question the expenditures of manpower and resources by the
Marshals Service during this 18 month period, we believe that
institutional pressure created by the existence of a bench
warrant and an indictment, left the Marshals Service with little
choice but to proceed as it did. Moreover, the USAO did little
to assist the Marshals Service in this matter. Indeed, during
the first part of this process the USAO thwarted the efforts of
the Director of the Marshals Service to focus the court on the
danger involved in making the arrest and incorrectly terminated
efforts by the Marshals Service to negotiate with Weaver through
intermediaries.

  With regard to the responsibility for the deaths that
occurred at the Y, the marshals assert that Harris initiated the
fire fight when he shot Deputy Marsha Degan while Weaver and
Harris claim that the marshals fired the first shots. After a
thorough review of all of the evidence made available to us, we
have been unable to determine conclusively who fired the first
shot during the exchange of gunfire. Although there is evidence
that one of the marshals shot Sammy Weaver during the exchange
of gunfire, we found no proof that the shooting of the boy was
anything other than an accident. In fact, the evidence
indicates that the marshals did not know that Sammy Weaver had
been killed or wounded until his body was discovered by the FBI
in a shed outside the Weaver cabin two days later. Nor did we
discover any evidence indicating that the marshals attempted to
cover up their roles in the incident or that they exaggerated
the events to cause a more drastic FBI response than was
appropriate.

  Soon after learning of the August 21 incident at Ruby
Ridge, the FBI officials in Washington, D.C. evaluated the
information made available to them and decided to deploy its
Hostage Rescue Team ("HRT") to Idaho to deal with the crisis. 
HRT members assumed their position around the Weaver compound
late in the afternoon of August 22, 1992 but before doing so
they were instructed that their conduct was to be governed by
specially formulated Rules of Engagement ("Rules"). These Rules
instructed the HRT snipers that before a surrender announcement
was made they could and should shoot all armed adult males
appearing outside the cabin. Operating under these Rules on
August 22, an FBI sniper/observer fired two shots in quick
succession. The first shot was at an armed adult male whom he
believed was bout to fire at a HRT helicopter on an observation
mission. The first shot wounded Randy Weaver while in front of
a building at the Weaver compound known as the birthing shed. 
The second shot was fired at Harris while Harris was retreating
into the Weaver cabin. The second shot seriously wounded Harris
and killed Vicki Weaver who was behind the cabin door.

  Following this shooting incident FBI officials spent the
next eight days attempting to convince Weaver and Harris to
surrender to federal authorities. Finally, due largely to the
efforts of nongovernmental negotiators, Harris and Weaver
surrendered on August 30 and August 31 respectively. 
Thereafter, the FBI completed its searches of the cabin and
surrounding areas. During the following month, the FBI also
conducted an internal review of the shooting incident to
determine if the sniper had responded appropriately.

  Our review found numerous problems with the conduct of
the FBI at Ruby Ridge. Although we concluded that the decision
to deploy the HRT to Ruby Ridge was appropriate and consistent
with Department policy, we do not believe that the FBI's initial
attempts at intelligence gathering at the scene were
sufficiently thorough. We also found serious problems with the
terms of the Rules of Engagement in force at Ruby Ridge. 
Certain portions of these Rules not only departed from the FBI's
standard deadly force policy but also contravened the
Constitution of the United States. In addition, we found these
Rules to be imprecise and believe that they may have created an
atmosphere that encouraged the use of deadly force thereby
having the effect of contributing to an unintentional death.

  With regard to the two shots fired on August 22, we
concluded that the first shot met the standard of "objective
reasonableness" the Constitution requires for the legal use of
deadly force but that the second shot did not satisfy that
standard. It is our conclusion that the sniper/observer who
took the second shot intended to shoot Kevin Harris but
accidentally killed Vicki Weaver whom he did not see behind the
curtained door. We also found the internal FBI review of the
shooting incident has not been sufficiently thorough and reached
incorrect conclusions about the second shot.

  Our examination of the command and control of the crisis
by the FBI, found numerous shortcomings. These shortcomings
included initial inadequacies in utilizing negotiating
personnel, communicating with FBI Headquarters, documenting
decisions and securing the site.

  During and after the crisis, the crime scenes were
searched by many law enforcement officials under the direct
supervision of the FBI. We found the FBI's handling of the
crime scene searches to be inadequate including its failure to
use basic crime scene techniques in collecting evidence. 
Furthermore, the general disorganization and inexperience of
some of the participants coupled with inaccuracies in the
searches adversely affected the prosecution and contributed to
the negative impression of the government generated during the
trial. We found no evidence that these deficiencies were
intentional or that the FBI staged evidence for the
prosecution's benefit.

  Shortly after their arrest, separate preliminary hearings
were held for Weaver and Harris. While arguing the government's
motion requesting a continuance of the Harris preliminary
hearing, U.S. Attorney Ellsworth made statements indicating that
the government would allow Harris to have a complete preliminary
hearing in return or consenting to the continuance. Thereafter,
Harris consented to the continuance with the understanding that
he would have a full preliminary hearing. An indictment was
returned against Harris while his preliminary hearing was in
progress. We have found that the U.S. Attorney did not
intentionally misrepresent the government's position but that he
failed to appreciate the impact of his statements and that he
neglected to pay sufficient attention to the information that
the received concerning the probably length of the preliminary
hearing.

  After the first indictments were returned against Weaver
and Harris, the Assistant U.S. Attorney continued to present
evidence to the grand jury which led to the return of two
superseding indictments, each containing a conspiracy count. We
found these conspiracy counts to be overly broad and to contain
some overt acts for which there was insufficient evidence.

 
[G.J.]

  Later the USAO decided to seek the death penalty against
Weaver and Harris even though the applicable federal appellate
court had held that the offense charged could not
constitutionally support the imposition of a death sentence. We
have concluded that the decision to seek the death penalty,
although made in good faith, gave the appearance that the
government was overreaching.

  From the moment that the USAO began to prepare the case
for trial, it met with resistance from the FBI. This resistance
took many forms, all of which served to make preparation of the
case more difficult. The FBI continuously opposed actions of
the prosecutors requested to prepare the case for trial, ranging
from having the case agents conduct out-of state interviews to
enlisting agents from other agencies to help prepare the case. 
The FBI, which wanted to be the only agency or, at a minimum,
the lead agency on the case, resisted working as a coequal
member of the prosecution team. Furthermore, when the USAO
sought advice and assistance from the FBI Laboratory they met
with unjustified delays and resistance that created discord
within the team and disrupted trial preparation. These problems
contributed to the USAO's decision to retain private forensic
experts.

  In addition, the FBI unjustifiably delayed producing
materials to the USAO that were needed for trial preparation and
that were clearly discoverable under federal law and the
discovery stipulation signed by the parties. This action
unreasonably delayed the availability of these materials for
trial preparation and for discovery. Particularly at the
headquarters level, we found that the FBI's efforts to locate
and produce discoverable documents to be disorganized and
incomplete. The late production during trial of materials
associated with the FBI Shooting Incident Report negatively
affected the court's and the jury's perception of the government
and the government's case. In addition, the delays in discovery
caused by the disorganization of and mistakes committed by the
FBI Laboratory contributed to the delay of the trial and to the
perception that the government was uncooperative and not being
totally forthcoming.

 However, the FBI was not alone in failing to make timely
disclosure of critical information to the defense. The USAO was
also responsible for not promptly revealing certain important
information to the defense. Although in some instances we found
these tardy disclosures to be unjustified or negligent, we do
not believe that they were improperly motivated or taken
intentionally to obstruct the Weaver trial.

  C. Significant Recommendations

  As the result of our investigation, we have made seven
broad recommendations. First, we recommend that all federal law
enforcement officers be governed by a standard deadly force
policy and that the Department of Justice be responsible for
developing such a policy. in addition to specifying clearly the
circumstances in which deadly force may be used, the policy
should define the occasions in which special Rules of Engagement
may be implemented and the process by which such rules should be
approved.

  Second, we recommend that a crisis response team,
including specially trained crisis managers, be available to
respond to crises. In addition, we endorse the proposal to
include specially trained prosecutors to provide legal support
to tactical teams when needed. We also propose periodic joint
training exercises by the various federal and local law
enforcement agencies which are responsible for responding to
crisis situation.

  Third, we recommend that a panel comprised of
representatives from federal law enforcement agencies, including
an attorney form the Department of Justice, be created to
examine the internal reviews that law enforcement agencies
conduct after shooting incidents occur. This examination would
focus on the thoroughness and prosecutive merit of the internal
review.

  Fourth, we recommend that FBI field offices that do not
have a team in place to recover evidence after major
hostage/barricade crises like Ruby Ridge request the assistance
of the Evidence Response Team at FBI Headquarters. We further
recommend that procedures be adopted to improve the coordination
between the FBI Laboratory and the federal prosecutors and that
and examination be done of the FBI procedures regarding the
memorializing of interviews.

  Sixth, we recommend that all U.S. Attorneys' Offices
institute a review process for indictments, at least for
significant cases.

  Finally, we recommend that our findings concerning the
events surrounding the shooting of Vicki Weaver on August 22,
1992 be referred to the appropriate component of the Department
of Justice to assess prosecutive merit. In addition, we
recommend that our analysis of the conduct of Assistant U.S.
Attorney Ronald Howen be referred to the Executive Office for
United States Attorneys for whatever administrative action it
deems appropriate.

 II. ORIGINS OF THE INVESTIGATION AND METHODOLOGY EMPLOYED

  In February 1993, the Criminal Division of the United
States Department of Justice (the "Department") informed the
Office of Professional Responsibility ("OPR") of allegations of
professional misconduct and criminal wrongdoing by agents of the
U.S. Marshals Service ("Marshals Service"), the Federal Bureau
of Investigations ("FBI"), the United States Attorney's Office
for the District of Idaho ("USAO"), and the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms ("BATF"), stemming from their involvement
in the investigation, apprehension, and prosecution of Randy
Weaver and Kevin Harris. Because Weaver and Harris were
awaiting trial, OPR in conformity with its normal policy of
avoiding interfering with the criminal process, postponed its
inquiry until the litigation had concluded.

  Following the jury verdict in July 1993, OPR began its
inquiry. OPR was aware of numerous allegations of impropriety,
some of which had been raised in defense pleadings and many
others that arose during and immediately after trial. 
Allegations by various people and groups -- the media, the trial
court, the United States Attorney's Office, the FBI, and U.S.
Senator Larry Craig of Idaho, as well as the public -- suggested
the personnel of the United States government had engaged in
willful misconduct, including obstruction of justice, perjury ,
and other criminal and ethical violations. As a result, it
became apparent that the scope of inquiry needed to be broader
than merely issues that had been raised at trial by the defense.

  Attorney General Janet Reno announced that the inquiry
would include a complete and thorough review of the Weaver case
from its inception to the conclusion of the criminal trial. OPR
was to conduct this inquiry with investigative support from the
FBI.

  On July 26, 1993, Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Counsel in the
Office of Professional Responsibility detailed the role of OPR
and the FBI in the inquiry in a letter to David G. Binney,
Assistant Director of the FBI's Inspection Division. Concerns
had been raised about the FBI's ability to be objective and to
investigate alleged misconduct by its own agents. Some who had
participated in the Weaver investigation and prosecution and had
experienced a decided lack of harmony in their working
relationship with the FBI, opposed the Bureau's involvement in
the investigation. However, OPR's experience with the FBI in
investigations in which the FBI was the subject -- including an
investigation of its own Director -- demonstrated that the
Bureau could be objective under OPR's supervision. Furthermore,
the broad scope of the Weaver inquiry and the need for FBI
expertise suggested that the Bureau be included in the inquiry.

  From the beginning of the investigation OPR attorneys
established that they would control the investigation, analyze 
the information gathered, and make finding and recommendations. 
The FBI's role was limited to assisting in gathering facts and
conducting interviews. The FBI was not to make findings,
conclusions, or recommendations.

  Due to the expansive scope of the inquiry, former Deputy
Attorney General Philip Heymann assigned four attorneys from the
Criminal Division of the Department of Justice to assist OPR. 
It was decided that the review would cover: the conduct of the
Marshals Service in its investigation of Randy Weaver from its
inception to the conclusion of the trial; the actions of the FBI
Hostage Rescue Team ("HRT") during the siege of the Weaver
residence; the handling of evidence by the FBI Laboratory and
its effect on the Weaver trial; and the conduct of the U.S.
Attorney's Office in investigating and prosecuting the Weaver
case.

  OPR contacted the Department of Treasury ("DOT"), which
had also received complaints about BATF's conduct and agreed
that its Inspector General's Office would investigate that
matter. However, it was understood that OPR would address those
elements of the BATF investigation that affected the Weaver case
and involved Department of Justice employees. To that end, OPR
invited DOT to participate in interviews relevant to its
investigation and to review material -- other than grand jury
testimony -- that would assist its inquiry. Although DOT is
preparing a report of its investigation, this report discusses
issues involving BATF that affected the Weaver matter.

  The FBI initially assigned 15 Inspectors and two
administrative support personnel to the Ruby Ridge Inspection
Team to work with the five DOJ attorneys. During the first
phase of the inquiry, the team developed an investigative focus,
established a management system, and attempted to identify,
through research and selected interviews, the issues to be
addressed. By August 1993, the team had determined the
background interviews that needed to be conducted and had
identified documents that needed to be reviewed, including case
files and supporting materials form the Marshals Service, the
USAO, and the FBI.

  Initially, the investigators used a research system
consistent with a typical FBI investigation. However, they soon
realized that a thorough review of the Weaver matter would
benefit from the support of the FBI's Rapid Start team of the
Information Resources Division of FBI Headquarters. Rapid Start
is a mobile group of FBI employees who provide information
management services to major cases. The Rapid Start team
developed an automated case management system to assist the
investigators in capturing, storing and retrieving information. 
The team also assisted the investigation in tracking leads and
with document control.

  As Phase I of the investigation entered its final stages,
it became apparent that the volume of material to be reviewed
and the broad scope of the inquiry would require more personnel
and time than had originally been contemplated. A decision was
made to increase the size of the investigative team. Thus, when
Phase II of the investigation began on September 21, 1993, the
Ruby Ridge Inspection Team was doubled in size to include two
full-time Inspectors, 26 Assistant Inspectors, and 10 support
personnel.

  Phase II was the investigative phase of the project. The
inspectors were divided into the four teams. The first team was
responsible for issues involving BATF and the Marshals Service. 
The second and third teams focused on the FBI role in the case
including the FBI Laboratory, the FBI's handling of the crime
scene, and the actions of the FBI HRT and its Rules of
Engagement. The last team examined the actions of the USAO
throughout its involvement in the Weaver matter. Each team was
comprised of a DOJ Attorney, an inspection team leader, and five
or six inspectors. The inspectors were encouraged to coordinate
their inquiry with the DOJ attorney. Many interviews involved
witnesses who had knowledge of issues being investigated by more
than one team. In those instances, inspectors from the other
teams either attended the interview, scheduled separate
interviews, or submitted preliminary questions to determine
whether an additional interview was necessary.

  The FBI inspectors and DOJ attorneys conducted over 370
interviews of persons involved in the Ruby Ridge incident,
including personnel of local, state, and federal law enforcement
agencies, the USAO, the Department of Justice, as well as members
of the federal judiciary and nongovernmental witnesses.[FN1]
The interviews were conducted throughout the United States and,
in some instances, supplemental interviews were conducted for
clarification. Although the majority of the interviews were
conducted by FBI inspectors, virtually all significant
interviews were conducted jointly by FBI inspectors and DOJ
attorneys. In addition, thousands of pages of records and files
were reviewed.

  Before the interview process began, DOJ and FBI personnel
developed a witness notification form describing the scope and
purpose of the inquiry. Each witness executed this form before
being interviewed. In addition, witnesses were asked to execute
waiver forms before statements were taken. In some instances,
interviewees were represented by counsel or declined to
volunteer information, instead relying on earlier sworn
testimony or statements.

  On November 8, 1993, then Deputy Attorney General Philip
Heymann responded to renewed objections to the investigative
role of the FBI in the inquiry. Heymann received the assurance
of the attorneys in charge of the inquiry that they could
accommodate interviewees who requested interviews outside the
presence of the FBI. The attorneys assured these interviewees
that the FBI was assisting them in gathering facts but that
the final report and its conclusion and recommendations would
originate from the DOJ attorneys. However, these interviewees
were advised that a record of their interviews would be given to
the FBI to assist its inquiry. In addition, we cautioned all
those interviewed that the Attorney General might release a
version of our final report to the public and, therefore, we
could not assure their confidentiality.

  On January 19, 1994, the FBI investigators submitted
their report of factual finding to the DOJ attorneys. Following
the receipt of the FBI report, the DOJ attorneys completed their
review of all pertinent materials and wrote a report analyzing
the many allegations. The original team of lawyers was assisted
by two attorneys from the Criminal Division who provided
additional research and analysis. In addition, another OPR
attorney assisted in the final stages of the preparation of this
report.

  This report was structured to be read in its entirety or
in isolated sections. The Factual Summary, Chronology, and the
Identification of Participants sections are intended to provide
a general overview of significant events, which will assist the
reader in understanding the detailed discussions that follow. 
Specific topics are generally arranged in chronological order
and contain detailed discussions of the relevant facts, the
issues raised and the finding made. Finally, we conclude with a
section which sets forth recommendations, most of which are
designed to anticipate and avoid the kinds of problems subject
to this inquiry. An Appendix accompanies this report, but
because of the volume of source material used in this inquiry,
it includes only the most significant documents.

 III. FACTUAL SUMMARY

  A. THE U.S. MARSHALS SERVICE

  In January 1985, the U.S. Secret Service investigated
allegations that Randy Weaver had made threats against the
President and other government and law enforcement officials. 
The Secret Service was told that Weaver was associated with the
Aryan Nations, a white supremacist group, and that he had a
large cache of weapons and ammunition. Weaver had spoken of the
world's ending in two years "when [his] home will be under siege
and assaulted." Secret Service agents interviewed Weaver, who
denied the allegations. No charges were filed.

  In February 1985, Weaver and his wife, Vicki, filed an
affidavit with the county clerk, giving "legal and official
notice that [he] believe[d] [he] may have to defend [him]self
and [his] family from physical attack on [his] life" by the FBI.

  Weaver came to the attention of the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms ("BATF") in July 1986, when a BATF
informant was introduced to him at a World Aryan Congress. The
informant met Weaver several times over the next three years. 
In July 1989, Weaver invited the informant to his home to
discuss forming a group to fight the "Zionist Organized
Government," referring to the U.S. Government. Three months
later, Weaver sold the informant two "sawed-off" shotguns.

  In June 1990, BATF agents approached Weaver to persuade
him to become an informant. Weaver refused to become a
"snitch," and he was indicted for manufacturing and possessing
an unregistered firearm. A warrant was issued for his arrest. 
BATF concluded that it would be too dangerous for the arresting
agents and the Weaver children to arrest Weaver at his
mountaintop residence. Instead, in January 1991, BATF agents,
posing as stranded motorists, surprised Weaver and his wife when
they stopped to offer assistance. Weaver told the arresting
agents "nice trick; you'll never do that again."

  Weaver was arraigned and was released on a personal
recognizance bond. A trial date was set for February 19, 1991. 
Shortly thereafter, Weaver's wife, Vicki, sent the U.S.
Attorney's Office two letters addressed to the servants of the
Queen of Babylon, which asserted that "[t]he tyrants blood will
flow" and "[w]hether we live or whether we die, we will not bow
to your evil commandments."

  A U.S. Probation Officer sent Weaver a letter
incorrectly referring to a March 20 trial date. Weaver did not
appear for the February trial, and a bench warrant was issued
for his arrest. On March 14, 1991, Weaver was indicted for
failure to appear for trial.

  The matter was referred to the U.S. Marshals Service,
which learned that Weaver had attended Aryan World Congresses
and that he and his family were constantly armed. Weaver sent a
letter to the local sheriff, stating the he would not leave his
cabin and that law enforcement officers would have to take him
out. The Weavers "felt as though the end [was] near." Weaver
was quoted as threatening to shoot law enforcement officers, who
came to arrest him. Weaver and his family remained in a cabin,
atop an isolated mountain.

  Between March 1991 and August 1992, the marshals
undertook a series of efforts to convince Weaver to surrender. 
They also made plans to arrest Weaver without harm to law
enforcement officers or the Weaver family, particularly the
children. The marshals exchanged messages with Weaver through
intermediaries, until the U.S. Attorney directed that all
communications go through Weaver's appointed counsel (with
whom Weaver would not speak).

  Teams from the Marshals Service Special Operations Group
("SOG") conducted surveillance of the Weavers' mountaintop
property to devise methods to take Weaver into custody safely. 
Surveillance cameras were installed and aerial photographs were
taken of the property. The marshals observed that Weaver and
his children responded to approaching persons and vehicles by
taking armed positions over the driveway leading to the Weaver
cabin. During this period, Weaver continued to make statements
that he would not surrender peacefully and that his family was
prepared to defend him.

  The Director of the Marshals Service ordered that no
action be taken that could endanger the Weaver children. In the
Spring of 1992, the marshals developed an undercover plan to
arrest Weaver away from his cabin and family.

  A surveillance team of six marshals went to the mountains
on August 21, 1992 to look for places to station cover teams for
the operation. Toward the end of the surveillance mission, one
of the Weaver's dogs began to chase three of the marshals. 
Marshals stationed at an observation post saw Kevin Harris, an
associate of Randy Weaver, Weaver, his thirteen year old son
Sammy, and Weaver's daughters, follow the dog. All were
carrying firearms.

  The marshals retreated. As they approached an
intersection of trails known as the "Y," they saw Randy Weaver
coming down the trail. They identified themselves and told him
to halt, but he turned and ran back up the trail. The dog
caught up with Deputy Marshal Cooper. He held the dog at bay
with his firearm, but did not shoot for fear of provoking the
Weavers. An exchange of gunfire occurred moments later,
resulting in the death of Deputy Marshal William Degan, Sammy
Weaver, and the dog.

  According to the marshals, the fire fight began when
Degan and Deputy Marshal Cooper rose to identify themselves. 
Kevin Harris wheeled and fired at Degan with a 30.06 rifle. 
Cooper returned fire and thought he hit Harris, though he had
not. Cooper turned his weapon toward Sammy Weaver, but did not
fire.

  Deputy Marshal Roderick, who was further down the path,
heard a shot from his left. Roderick could not see anyone other
than Weaver's dog, which was heading in the direction Randy
Weaver had gone. When the first shot was fired, the dog turned
its head toward the marshals. Roderick feared that the dog
would turn and attack him or lead Weaver, Harris, and the others
to the marshals. Roderick fired at the dog, killing him.

  Sammy Weaver then shot at Roderick, and Roderick dove
into the woods. Roderick later found a bullet hole through his
shirt, though he was not wounded. Cooper heard the shots to his
right. He rose and fired a three-round burst to provide cover
fire for himself so that he could get to Degan, who called for
help. Following the last shots, Cooper saw Sammy Weaver run out
of view up the trail to the Weaver cabin. He did not think that
he had hit the boy.

  Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris claimed that they did not
know what the dog was chasing, though there is evidence to the
contrary. They said that they thought they were pursuing a
large animal. They asserted that the first shot fired at the Y
was Roderick's attack on the dog, that Sammy fired at Roderick
in retaliation, and that Degan and Cooper then shot at Sammy. 
Harris maintained that the marshals did not identify themselves
until the shooting had ended and that he shot Degan to defend
Sammy.

  Soon after the shooting, the three marshals, who had been
at the observation post, ran to the Y. They came under fire
along the way. One marshal, a medic, treated Degan, without
success. Shortly thereafter, the marshals heard a barrage of
gunfire, followed by screaming and crying. After a brief time,
two marshals left the hill to seek help. The three surviving
marshals maintained their positions out of fear that, if they
moved, they would be shot at. They also refused to leave
without the body of the slain marshal. They did not receive
additional fire, though in the hours that followed they heard
shots when an airplane flew overhead.

  B. Federal Bureau of Investigation - Deployment of
Hostage Rescue Team

  As soon as the U.S. Marshals Service received word of
Marshal Degan's death and the ongoing situation at Ruby Ridge,
they sought and received FBI assistance. The FBI had primary
jurisdiction for assaults on federal officers, and its Hostage
Rescue Team ("HRT") is seen as uniquely skilled for crises. FBI
and Marshals Service Headquarters immediately activated command
centers to coordinate communications. Special Agent Eugene
Glenn was assigned the command and began to arrange for the
personnel and equipment required for the crisis. Concurrently,
state and local law enforcement and a few FBI agents who were in
the immediate area came to the scene and began securing the area.

  The rescue of the marshals was delayed until after dark. 
A team led by the Idaho State Police reached the marshals at
approximately 11:30 p.m., more than twelve hours after the
shooting. The rescue effort was ongoing when Glenn arrived and
deployed FBI SWAT teams to secure the command post's perimeter. 
He planned to maintain the status quo until the HRT had arrived. 
Local law enforcement continued to guard the access road as a
crowd of sympathizers and onlookers gathered.

  The marshals were successfully removed from the mountain
without additional gun fire. Once rescued, they were examined a
a hospital and transported to a command post where they were
given food and allowed to rest. FBI agents interviewed the
marshals, starting the following afternoon.

   C. Rules of Engagement and the Death of
Vicki Weaver on August 22

  While the rescue of the marshals was underway, the HRT
advance team was en route to Idaho with the Associate Director
of the Marshals Service, who briefed then about Weaver's
background, his failure to appear for trial, the underlying
weapons charge, and his professed desire to confront the federal
government. During the flight, HRT Commander Rogers and FBI
Associate Director Potts drafted special Rules of Engagement to
address the danger they perceived. When the HRT arrived in
Idaho, Rogers briefed them on the situation and the proposed
Rules of Engagement. They established a command site, flew
reconnaissance missions, and began to make plans to address the
crisis.

  On the afternoon of the shooting, the U.S. Attorney's
Office obtained a search warrant and complaints for Randy Weaver
and Kevin Harris's arrest on charges relating the the death of
Marshal Degan. Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen, who was
assigned to the case, went to the site. Howen remained until
Weaver and Harris surrendered a week later. Howen took no role
in developing the Rules of Engagement or drafting operations
plans, but he did participate in crime scene searches,
interviews, and negotiations. The Boundary County prosecutor
was also present during most of the crisis but was not involved
in the operations planning.

  According to the HRT plan, communication with the
occupants of the Weaver cabin, including a surrender demand, was
to take place using armored personnel carriers, which would
deliver a telephone to the cabin site. The HRT was concerned
that the Weavers or sympathizers might be hiding in the woods
and planning an ambush. Therefore, teams of HRT
sniper/observers were stationed overlooking the cabin before the
carrier drove up the hill. Although FBI headquarters had not
approved a tactical operations plan, permission was granted to
begin negotiations with the Weavers when HRT agents arrived at
their positions.

  At 3:30 p.m. on August 22, HRT sniper/observers, along
with members of the Marshals Service SOG, began their ascent to
the cabin. Before their departure, they were briefed on the
Rules of Engagement, which provided that:

 1. If any adult male is observed with a weapon prior to
the announcement, deadly force can and should be employed, if
the shot can be taken without endangering any children.

 2. If any adult in the compound is observed with a weapon
after the surrender announcement is made, and is not attempting
to surrender, deadly force can and should be employed to
neutralize the individual.

 3. If compromised by any animal, particularly the dogs,
that animal should be eliminated.

 4. Any subjects other than Randall Weaver, Vicki Weaver,
Kevin Harris, presenting threats of death or grievous bodily
harm, the FBI rules of deadly force are in effect. Deadly force
can be utilized to prevent the death or grievous bodily injury
to oneself or that of another.

  No shots had been fired since the previous day, but,
while the HRT members were moving to positions overlooking the
cabin, other observers reported to FBI headquarters that the
subjects were outside the cabin. FBI Headquarters reminded the
field commander that the Rules of Engagement would apply. By
5:45 p.m., the sniper/observers reached their positions. The
engines of the personnel carriers at the command post below were
audible. An unarmed, young female ran from the cabin to a rocky
outcropping and returned to the cabin. Within a minute, an
unarmed male was seen on the cabin's back deck. About ten
minutes later, a helicopter carrying HRT personnel began an
observation mission. When the helicopter's engine was started,
the female seen earlier and two males ran from the cabin to the
outcropping. The last person to emerge was carrying a rifle. 
Sniper/observer Horiuchi identified him as Kevin Harris.

  A few seconds later Horiuchi saw a person he believed to
be Harris near an outbuilding known as the "birthing shed." The
man appeared to be scanning above and behind the snipers for the
helicopter. Horiuchi believed that he was trying to position
himself to shoot at the helicopter from the more protected side
of the shed. Horiuchi fired one shot as the man suddenly moved
along the side of the shed out of sight. When Horiuchi fired,
the man's back was toward Horiuchi and the helicopter. Because
the man moved unexpectedly, Horiuchi assumed he missed. The man
he aimed at was not Harris, but Weaver, who was slightly
wounded.

  Harris and Weaver have maintained that they had no
aggressive purpose in leaving the cabin and that Weaver was
opening the door to the shed to look at the body of his son.

  After ten or twenty seconds Horiuchi saw the target of
his first shot following the other two people as they ran to the
cabin. The first two entered the cabin through an open door. 
Horiuchi fired, aiming slightly in front of the last running
man. The bullet went through the curtained window of the open
door, fatally wounding Vicki Weaver and seriously injuring Kevin
Harris. The sniper testified that he did not know that Vicki
Weaver was standing behind the door.

  When Commander Rogers, who had been aboard the HRT
helicopter, learned of the shootings, he and an FBI negotiator
went in a personnel carrier to the cabin to make a surrender
announcement and to begin negotiations by leaving a telephone. 
There was no response. A few hours later, due to deteriorating
weather conditions, the snipers left their positions and
returned to the command post where Rogers debriefed them. The
next morning the snipers returned to their positions. Rogers
once again went to the cabin area and issued repeated surrender
announcements, which included warnings that the outbuildings
would be removed if Weaver failed to comply.

  By Sunday evening, there was still no response or
indication that the Weavers were going to surrender or
negotiate, so the first outbuilding, the birthing shed, was
moved. Sammy Weaver's body was discovered in the birthing shed.

  Negotiation efforts continued for days, but were
unsuccessful. No one from the cabin picked up the telephone,
which was on an armed robot outside the cabin. Although the
weapon on the robot was not loaded, Weaver reported that he was
afraid that anyone who went outside would be shot. Attempts to
intercept conversations inside the cabin were not successful. 
By Wednesday, no aggressive action had occurred for days, and
the events which had preceded the confrontation began to seem
less clear. The FBI command received evidence in apparent
conflict with the initial impressions about Weaver's background
and the circumstances surrounding the shootout. As a result,
the FBI command decided to withdraw the special Rules of
Engagement and to instate the FBI's standard Deadly Force
Policy.

  On Wednesday, August 26, Weaver told a negotiator that he
wanted to talk with his sister. When she arrived, attempts to
communicate with Weaver were frustrated by her inability to hear
Weaver. On Friday evening, August 28, Weaver agreed to speak
with Bo Gritz, whom Weaver told that the sniper had killed his
wife and injured Harris and himself. Two other private citizens
assisted Gritz in resolving the standoff. Gritz and a Weaver
family friend carried Vicki Weaver's body out of the cabin. On
Sunday, August 30, Kevin Harris surrendered. The Weavers
surrendered the following day.

  Searches of the Y were ongoing during the crisis. After
the surrender, the cabin and surrounding area were searched. 
The FBI also sent a team of inspectors to begin an internal
inquiry into the sniper shootings.

  D. The Prosecution

  After their surrender, Harris and Weaver were placed
under arrest and charged with the murder of Deputy Marshal
Deagan. Separate preliminary hearings to determine probable
cause for these charges were begun. Before their preliminary
hearings concluded, a grand jury indicted Harris for assaulting
and murdering Degan and indicted Weaver for aiding and abetting
in Degan's death. Thereafter, the magistrate judges terminated 
the preliminary hearings of Weaver and Harris. Both defendants
pleaded not guilty to all charges. On October 1, 1992, a grand
jury returned a superseding indictment charging Weaver and
Harris with numerous offenses including conspiracy.[FN2] On 
November 19, 1992 a Second Superseding Indictment was returned 
charging Weaver and Harris with the same offenses as the 
previous indictment and alleging additional overt acts.

  In October 1992 the Marshals Service and BATF provided
four agents to assist the U.S. Attorney's Office in preparing
the case for trial. During the case preparation process
continuous issues arose regarding the cooperation of the FBI in
preparing the case for trial. Included among these problem
areas was the lack of cooperation by the FBI in providing
discovery materials to the prosecution and the defense.

  On January 8, 1993, on motion by the defense, the
February 2 trial date was extended to allow time for the defense
to review evidence and the results of FBI Laboratory tests. The
defense complained about the government's failure to provide
timely access to evidence and documents, and the trial judge
admonished the prosecutors to have the laboratory examination
completed quickly.

  The 42 day jury trial began on April 13, 1993. During
the trial, the defendants brought to the court's attention
problems they had in obtaining documents and information to
which they believed they were entitled under either federal law
or a discovery stipulation with the government. The most
extreme breach of the stipulation involved the late production
of the underlying materials and notes related to the FBI
Shooting Incident Report which had been produced as the result
of an internal inquiry into the sniper shootings. Although the
defendants had received the final Shooting Incident Report
before trial, during trial the FBI, in response to a defense
subpoena, sent by fourth class mail materials that were not part
of the documents that the FBI had produced earlier in discovery. 
These materials included a drawing Horiuchi made days after the
shooting. The drawing arrived in Idaho after Horiuchi had
completed his testimony, thus requiring his return for
additional testimony. The court fined the government for the
attorneys fees incurred by the defendants for the lost trial
day.

  One of the two prosecutors became ill and did not
participate in the final arguments. After deliberation for 20
days, on July 8, 1993, the jury acquitted Weaver and Harris of
the murder of Deputy Marshal Degan, the conspiracy charge, and
the significant remaining charges. Weaver was convicted on
charges of failure to appear for trial and committing an offense
while on release. On October 26, 1993, Weaver was sentenced to
18 months incarceration, three years probation and a $10,000
fine. The court issued an Order fining the FBI and criticizing
it for its failure to produce discovery materials, its failure
to obey orders and admonitions of the court, and its
indifference to the rights of the defendant and to the
administration of justice.

  On December 18, 1993, Randy Weaver was released from
incarceration.

 IV. SPECIFIC ISSUES INVESTIGATED

  A. Investigation of Weaver by Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms

   1. Introduction

  The events that led to the death of three persons at Ruby
Ridge, Idaho in August 1992 and to the subsequent prosecution of
Randall ("Randy") Weaver and Kevin Harris had their origin with
an investigation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
("BATF"). Serious allegations have been made about the role of
BATF in the Weaver matter. Included among these allegations are
that a BATF informant entrapped Weaver into selling illegal
weapons; that a BATF reward system created the incentive for the
informant to entrap Weaver; and that BATF and the informant
tired to conceal this future compensation arrangement from the
defense, the court and the U.S. Attorney's Office.[FN3] It has also
been alleged that BATF exaggerated to the U.S. Marshals
Service, the U.S. Attorney 's Office, and the court the extent
of Weaver's involvement with the Aryan Nations and the Order and
that federal law enforcement unconstitutionally targeted Randy
Weaver for prosecution because of his religious views.[FN4]

  2. Statement of Facts

   a. Early Law Enforcement Contacts with Randy
Weaver

  Randy Weaver first came to the attention of federal law
enforcement personnel in 1985 as a result of alleged threats he
made against President Reagan, Idaho Governor John Evans, and
certain law enforcement officials.[FN5] The U.S. Secret Service
investigated the allegations and interviewed Weaver. During
this investigation, it was learned that Weaver was frequently
visited by Frank Kumnick, who was associated with members of the
Aryan Nations, a white-supremacist group.[FN6] Kumnick was
described as the "mentor" for Weaver's "far right wing" beliefs.
[FN7] Weaver and Kumnick had allegedly spoken of burning churches
and had made threats against Catholics and Jews.[FN8] In addition,
Weaver had been seen with Richard Butler, leader of a local
Aryan Nations Church.[FN9]

  The Secret Service was also told that Weaver had a cache
of weapons, including a number of semi and fully automatic
handguns and rifles,[FN10] and that he had access to explosives and
to "an unlimited amount of ammunition."[FN11] Weaver had been
described as a person with a "paranoid defensive attitude,"[FN12]
who had chosen his mountaintop residence "for survivalist
purposes."[FN13] One Bonners Ferry resident reported that Weaver
had "rigged his driveway with bombs."[FN14] Another person
interviewed by the Secret Service stated that Weaver had spoken
of the world ending in two years "when my home will be under
siege and assaulted."[FN15]

  Secret Service agents interviewed Weaver on February 12,
1985. At that time, he denied threatening the President, the
Governor, or churches. He also denied having any affiliation
with the Aryan Nations or its members.[FN16] Weaver said that he
had "no time for Aryan Nation's preachers" and that his religious
beliefs were "strictly by the bible." He acknowledged knowing
Frank Kumnick, but said that Kumnick was associated with the
Covenant, Sword and Arm of the Lord. Weaver informed the agents
that he had served for three years as an Army Special Forces
Green Beret and that he had been an Army engineer.[FN17] He stated
that the Bible gave him the right to kill, if necessary, to
defend his family,[FN18] but added the federal authorities were
welcome on his property "in spite of stories that had circulated
about him and his family."[FN19]

  On February 28, 1985, Randy and Vicki Weaver filed a
handwritten affidavit with the Boundary County Clerk claiming
that persons around Deep Creek, Idaho were conspiring to
endanger the Weaver family and to precipitate an attack on Randy
Weaver's life. The affidavit alleged that Weaver's "accusers"
had made false statements about his connections with the Aryan
Nations and his ownership of illegal weapons and that they had
wrongfully alleged that he had threatened the President and the
Pope. The Weavers also stated that these falsehoods were
designed to provoke the FBI into storming their home. Weaver
expressed fear that he would be killed or arrested for assault
of a federal officer, if he tried to defend himself, and he gave
"legal and official notice that [he] believe[d] [he] may have to
defend [him]self and [his] family from physical attack on [his]
life."[FN20]

  In May 1985, Weaver sent a letter to President Reagan
claiming that his neighbors had sent the President a threatening
letter under Weaver's name. Weaver apologized for their "evil"
in involving the President in their efforts to harass Weaver.
On the same date, Vicki Weaver sent a letter to the Spokane
Field Office of the U.S. Secret Service demanding a written
apology from the Secret Service.[FN21] The federal government never
filed any charges against Weaver for the alleged threats made
against the President, the Governor, or others.[FN22]

    b. BATF Contact with Weaver

  Weaver first came to the attention of the BATF in July
1986 during its investigation of a series of bombings in Coer
d'Alene, Idaho in which the Aryan Nations was believed to be
involved. BATF asked Kenneth Fadeley, a confidential informant,
to assist its investigation by obtaining information about
people attending an upcoming World Aryan Congress who might be
engaged in illegal activities.[FN23] Thereafter, Fadeley portrayed
himself as a weapons dealer who catered to motorcycle gangs and,
in this role, managed to be introduced to high level members of
the Aryan Nations in Northern Idaho.[FN24]

  In July, 1986, Fadeley attended the World Aryan Congress
at Hayden Lake, Idaho. During this assembly, Fadeley was
introduced to Weaver, who was at that time of no particular
investigative significance to BATF.[FN25]

  Six months later, in January 1987, Fadeley met with Frank
Kumnick, who was suspected of significant firearms trafficking.
Fadeley wore a hidden taper recorder to this meeting. Randy
Weaver accompanied Kumnick. Fadeley had met with Kumnick more
than a dozen times before, and although Weaver's name had been
mentioned numerous times, Fadeley had not expected Weaver at
this meeting.[FN26] In Weaver's presence, Kumnick, after suggesting
that Fadeley was a government informant, held a gun to Fadeley's
head and ran an electronic stud finder over Fadeley's body to
search for a hidden microphone or recorder. Kumnick did not
find the recorder.[FN27] At this meeting, Weaver gave Fadeley no
indication that he was predisposed to selling illegal weapons.
[FN28] [G.J.]

   [FN29][G.J.]

  At the World Aryan Congress in July 1987, Fadeley again
met Weaver, who was accompanied by his wife and children.
Weaver mentioned to Fadeley that it was a "struggle" to provide
for his family. Weaver also declared that he did not trust the
leaders of the Aryan Nations and that he did not agree with the
actions of Richard Butler, leader of the Aryan Nations.[FN30] After
this contact, Fadeley continued to view Weaver simply as one of
the many attendees at the World Aryan Congress.

    c. Sale of Weapons by Weaver to BATF Informant

  Fadeley and Weaver met again at the July 1989 World Aryan
Congress, where Weaver was one of the speakers.[FN31] Fadeley told
Weaver that his gun "business [was] busy." In response, Weaver
did not offer to sell Fadeley firearms, but he did invite
Fadeley to a house he was renting to discuss forming a group to
fight the "Zionist Organized Government" a term used by Aryan
nations members to refer to the U.S. Government.[FN32] According to
Weaver, the proposed group was to include Kumnick and Chuck
Holwrth. Holwrth, who had been convicted of an explosives
violation an had formed an Aryan Nations splinter group in
Montana,[FN33] was of "continuing investigative interest" to the
BATF. After learning of Weaver's plan to include Holworth in this
group, the BATF began to view Weaver as a possible point of
introduction to Holworth.[FN34]

  On September 8, 1989, at BATF's request, Fadeley
telephoned Weaver and arranged to meet him on October 11.[FN35]
Fadeley did not record his conversations with Weaver during the
October 11 meeting. At the meeting, Weaver asked Fadeley how
his business was going. Fadeley replied that he was "extremely
busy" and that he had sold all his "product." Weaver explained
that he would like to assist Fadeley and that "he was ready to
go to work for [him]."[FN36] Fadeley then told Weaver he had a
source to whom he dealt guns. Weaver then asked what the most
popular items were, and Fadeley described the "street" weapons he
thought he could sell, including shotguns. In response, Weaver
said that he could supply four or five shotguns per week.
Fadeley recalled Weaver representing that he could get any size
shotguns that Fadeley wanted. According to Fadeley, Weaver said
"just tell me what you want and what size and I'll supply what
you want." Weaver added that there would be "no paper," that
is, the weapons would not have registration documents.[FN37]

  As the two men left the meeting, Fadeley walked to
Weaver's truck where Weaver showed Fadeley a shotgun and
indicated a spot on the barrel where he thought it could be cut.
Fadeley pointed to the weapon and said "about here"[FN38] to
which Weaver asserted that he could supply weapons like that
"all day long."[FN39] Following the meeting, Special Agent Herbert
Byerly, Fadeley's BATF contact agent, conducted various records
checks on Weaver.[FN40]

  On October 13, 1989, Fadeley telephoned Weaver from a
BATF office and recorded the conversation to confirm his report
of the October 11 meeting. During this discussion, Fadeley and
Weaver used agreed upon code words and referred to weapons as
"chain saws."[FN41]

  On October 24, 1989, Weaver met with Fadeley, who was
wearing a miniature tape recorder and an electronic transmitter.
At that time, Weaver gave Fadeley two shotguns, one with a 13
inch barrel, the other with a 12-3/4 inch barrel. Weaver told
Fadeley that he had cut the shotgun barrels himself, "[s]itting
under a shade tree with a vise and a hacksaw," and added that,
"when I get my workshop set up I can do a better job."[FN42]
Fadeley paid Weaver $300.00 for the weapons. When Weaver
requested an additional $150.00 for the weapons, Fadeley told
him that he would give him the additional money at the next
purchase.[FN43] Fadeley then proceeded to tell Weaver that "[t]here
is money to be had, and it looks like [you] did a real nice
job". He then asked Weaver, "You figured four or five a
week?" to which Weaver replied, "yeah, or more."  Weaver repeated
that there would be no paper trail on the weapons.[FN44]

     Fadeley met Weaver again on November 30, 1989 with the intent
of arranging a trip to Montana to meet Holworth.  At this time,
Weaver announced that he had five additional sawed-off shotguns
available for purchase.  When Fadeley told him that he had not
brought enough money to pay for them, Weaver responded, "just
figure on more cash next time."  Thereafter, Weaver asked Fadeley
if he had "a cover, legit business."  In addition, Weaver told
Fadeley that he was not able to go to Montana that day, but said
that "the next time that I tell you I'll go with ya . . . I'll make
sure I'll go with you."  Fadeley paid Weaver $100 toward the
balance of the previous purchase of two sawed-off shotguns.[FN45]
Following this meeting, Byerly instructed Fadeley to have no
additional contact with Weaver.[FN46]

 d.   Delay in Obtaining Indictment and BATF Efforts
to Enlist Weaver as an Informant

     On November 24, 1989, Byerly discussed the Weaver gun sale
with Assistant U.S. Attorney Tony Hall from the U.S. Attorney's
Office in Boise ("USAO").  Hall requested Byerly to submit a
criminal violation report to the USAO.[FN47]  Five months later, on May
21, 1990, Byerly submitted a case report to the USAO
recommending that Weaver be prosecuted for the sale of the
sawed-off shotguns.[FN48]

     One month later, in June 1990, BATF Agents Byerly and
Gunderson drove to the Weaver property to speak with Weaver to
determine if he might be willing to cooperate in their
investigation of Aryan Nations members.  They were met by Weaver's
daughter, Sara, who had a semi-automatic pistol strapped to her
hip, and by his son, Sammy, who carried a large hunting knife.
Byerly and Gunderson did not identify themselves and left when they
determined that Randy Weaver was not there.[FN49]

     After leaving the mountain, Byerly and Gunderson noticed Randy
Weaver's truck outside a motel in Sandpoint, Idaho and stopped to
talk with him.  Thereafter, they approached Weaver, identified
themselves, showed Weaver a photograph of the sawed-off shotguns he
had sold to Fadeley and told him that they had a tape recording of
the transaction.  Weaver declined their invitation to listen to the
tape.  Byerly explained to Weaver that the USAO knew of the illegal
weapons sale and that Weaver could help himself by providing
information to BATF about the illegal activities of Aryan Nations
members.  He told Weaver that his assistance would be brought to
the U.S. Attorney's attention.[FN50]  At the end of the conversation,
Byerly gave Weaver his telephone number and told him that they
would wait for Weaver to come to the BATF office to discuss
cooperating with them.  Weaver responded that he would not become
a "snitch."[FN51]

     Soon after this contact with Weaver, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Howen told Byerly that he planned to present an indictment to the
grand jury charging Weaver with firearms violations but that the
timing of the indictment would have to be coordinated with the
other matters he was handling.[FN52]  On December 13, 1990, seven
months after BATF referred the case to the USAO, a federal grand
jury in the District of Idaho indicted Weaver for manufacturing and
possessing an unregistered firearm.

 e.   Arrest and Arraignment of Weaver on Weapons Charges

     After the issuance of the arrest warrant, BATF conducted an
evaluation of Weaver and concluded that it would be too dangerous
to the arresting agents and to the Weaver children for BATF to
arrest Weaver at his residence.[FN53]  Therefore, BATF agents decided
to carry out a ruse to arrest Weaver by surprise away from his
home. On January 17, 1991, two agents, posing as stranded
motorists, stopped a pickup camper on a bridge near the Weaver's
residence, raised the hood, and pretended to examine the engine.
Byerly, other BATF Agents, and Boundary County Sheriff Whittaker
hid in the back of the camper.  Shortly thereafter, Randy and Vicki
Weaver stopped their truck and approached the camper.  The BATF
agents then surprised Weaver and placed him under arrest.  In the
process, Weaver attempted to grab one of the agent's sidearms.
Later, Weaver told the arresting agents "nice trick; you'll never
do that again."[FN54]  After making the arrest, the arresting agents
discovered that Weaver had a pistol in his front pants pocket and
Vicki Weaver had a revolver in her purse, which she had left in
their pickup truck.[FN55]

          3.  Discussion

     It has been alleged that BATF singled out Randy Weaver because
he shared many of the political and religious beliefs associated
with the Aryan Nations, and that BATF entrapped Weaver in order to
coerce him to become an informant.[FN56]  We found insufficient
evidence to support these claims.

               a.  The Decision of BATF to Target Weaver

     This investigation found no evidence that BATF improperly
targeted Weaver because of his religious or political beliefs.
Instead, the evidence indicates that BATF became interested in
Weaver not because of his personal views but rather because he was
acquainted with members of the Aryan Nations, who were suspected of
being involved in bombings that had occurred in Northern Idaho.
Indeed, BATF, which knew of Weaver's beliefs for more than three
years before the sale of the shotguns in October 1989, had taken no
action to target Weaver for investigative focus during that period.
Byerly told this inquiry that the original purpose in pursuing the
transaction with Weaver was not to recruit Weaver as an informant,
but rather to determine the degree of his involvement in illicit
weapons trafficking by the Aryan Nations.[FN57]  We find nothing
improper in the BATF plan.

     We also examined why the government prosecuted Weaver for the
alleged gun sale while deciding not to prosecute Frank Kumnick, who
had also sold a "short-barrel" shotgun to Fadeley.  Byerly told
this inquiry that he recommended to the USAO that Kumnick not be
charged because an indictment would ruin Fadeley's cover, thus
ending his usefulness as an informant.[FN58]  Although this may explain
why Kumnick was not initially prosecuted it fails to explain why he
was not prosecuted after Fadeley's cover was "blown" in March 1990.
Notwithstanding the failure to explain why Kumnick was not
prosecuted after March 1990, we found no evidence that this
difference in treatment was improperly motivated.

     Byerly told this inquiry that he decided to solicit Weaver's
cooperation, rather than Kumnick's, because he believed that Weaver
had, or was in a better position to develop, contacts with BATF
targets, such as Chuck Holworth and Richard Butler, leader of the
Aryan Nation's Church in Northern Idaho.  In addition, Byerly came
to view Kumnick as a "boastful showoff" who was not involved in
"significant firearms trafficking."[FN59]  We accept Byerly's reasons
for seeking Weaver's cooperation and find nothing improper about
his decision to approach Weaver as a possible source of information
about illegal acts committed by members of the Aryan Nations.

               b.  Possible Entrapment by the BATF Informant

     Defense counsel have charged that Weaver "was induced by
federal authorities" into selling illegal weapons, that is, the
government entrapped Weaver into unlawful conduct.[FN60]  To establish
the defense of entrapment, it must be shown that the defendant was
not predisposed to commit the criminal act.[FN61] A principal factor
in determining whether a defendant was entrapped is whether the
defendant evidenced reluctant to commit the offense but was
overcome by repeated government persuasion.[FN62]

     The only accounts of Weaver's weapons sales that we have are
the recorded conversations between Weaver and informant Fadeley and
the statements of Byerly and Fadeley made at trial and to this
investigation.  We did not have the benefit of any statements from
Randy Weaver, who did not testify at trial and who declined our
invitation for an interview.

     Based on the information available to us, there is no evidence
that Weaver proposed or was interested in selling weapons before
the October 1989 meeting with Fadeley.  Although Fadeley had seen
Weaver on a number of occasions with a variety of weapons, Weaver
apparently had never said that he wanted to sell guns.  Nor is
there any indication that Fadeley repeatedly proposed that Weaver
sell weapons to him and that Weaver had refused.

     Weaver claimed in a recorded conversation that Fadeley
"approached [him] and offered [him] a deal."[FN63]  Fadeley later
replied that the person who had told Weaver that Fadeley was a
federal agent was a "scumbag."[FN64]  Fadeley told the Department of
Treasury investigators that Weaver's statement was

a complete fabrication . . . . I had never
approached him or offered him any deal.  He
made all the overtures.  I did not confront
him on this [during the meeting].  I felt that
if I did, he may take that as a signal that I
was an informant or police and I would be in
danger.[FN65]

     However, Fadeley admitted that he had shown Weaver where to
cut the shotgun in response to Weaver's saying, "Just tell me 
what . . . size [shotgun] and I'll supply what you want."[FN66]
Unfortunately, this meeting was not tape recorded, nor did Fadeley
report to Byerly, his BATF supervisor, that he had given Weaver
this guidance.[FN67]

     We are troubled by the lack of first-hand information about
the events immediately before the first weapons sale.  Furthermore,
the crucial meeting, at which Weaver allegedly raised the idea of
selling weapons to Fadeley, was not recorded.  The only account of
the meeting comes from Fadeley.  Although in the recorded November
30 conversation, Weaver expressed additional interest in providing
weapons to Fadeley,[FN68] we cannot conclude, on the evidence before
us, that Weaver was coerced or unduly enticed into selling weapons
to Fadeley.

               c.  Delay in Obtaining Indictment

     It has been alleged that Weaver's indictment on weapons
charges was delayed so as to give BATF an opportunity to "turn"
Weaver, that is, to make him a BATF informant.  Although BATF was
interested in securing Weaver's cooperation, we have found no
evidence that the indictment was delayed to help this effort.

     Byerly apparently waited to press the weapons charge after the
October 1989 sale because BATF did not want to expose Fadeley as an
informant.[FN69]  However, in March 1990, members of the Aryan 
Nations accused Fadeley of being an informant, effectively ending 
the covert operation.

     In early May 1990, Byerly submitted a case report to the U.S.
Attorney's Office recommending that Weaver be prosecuted for the
sale of the sawed-off shotguns. Byerly approached Weaver to seek
his cooperation in June 1990. Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen told
Byerly that the weapons charge against Weaver would be presented to
a grand jury, but that the case would be handled in line with his
other priorities.[FN70] Seven months later, the matter was presented
to a grand jury and an indictment was returned in December 1990.

     This investigation has uncovered nothing that suggests
misconduct in the span between the weapons sale in 1989 and the
indictment in December 1990.  Weaver's indictment was evidently not
a high priority of either BATF or the USAO, and there is no
evidence that the charge was treated as anything but a routine
matter.

          4.  Conclusion

     It is our conclusion that the investigation which led to
Weaver's indictment for the unlawful sale of two sawed-off
shotguns, and the decision to indict were proper.  We found no
evidence that Weaver was unfairly targeted by BATF at the outset or
that the delay in indicting him was improper.  Although we are
troubled by the sequence of events which immediately preceded the
sale of the shotguns to the confidential informant, we cannot
conclude, based on the evidence before us, that Weaver was coerced
or unduly enticed into selling the sawed-off shotguns.

IV. SPECIFIC ISSUES INVESTIGATED

     B.  The Failure of Weaver to Appear for Trial

          1. Introduction

     On January 18, 1991, Randy Weaver was arraigned on the charges
that he made an possessed illegal firearms.  At that time, the
court set February 19, 1991, as the trial date.  Several weeks
later the court clerk sent a notice to the parties informing them
that the trial date had been changed from February 19 to February
20.  Two days later, U.S. Probation Officer Karl Richins sent a
letter to Weaver in which he erroneously referred to the trial date
as March 20, 1991.  When Weaver did not appear in court on February
20, the court issued a bench warrant for his arrest.  Almost a
month later, on March 14, 1991, when the bench warrant was still
outstanding, a federal grand jury returned an indictment against
Weaver charging him with failure to appear for trial.

     A number of issues have been raised with regard to the conduct
of the government in handling this stage of the Weaver matter. 
These issues include: whether government officials, particularly
the U.S. Attorney's Office, knew about the erroneous Richins letter
before the court issued the February 20 bench warrant; whether the
government responded appropriately to the issues created by the
Richins letter; whether the U.S. Attorney's Office erred in
presenting the indictment to the grand jury before March 20;
                             [G.J.]

          2.  Statement of Facts

               a.  January 18, 1991 Arraignment

     On December 13, 1990, a federal grand jury indicted Randy
Weaver for making and possessing illegal firearms.[FN71] BATF Agent
Herbert Byerly arrested Weaver on January 17, 1991 and transported
him to Coeur D'Alene, Idaho for arraignment.  On January 18, Byerly
informed Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen that Weaver had been
arrested, that Weaver had resisted arrest, that Weaver had said
when arrested, "nice trick; you'll never do that again" and that
Weaver appeared to be associated with the Aryan Nation.  Byerly
also provided background information on the case and recommended to
Howen that Weaver be detained because Byerly did not believe that
he would appear for trial.  According to Byerly, Howen responded
that it would be difficult to detain Weaver and did not offer to
oppose the release of Weaver.[FN72]

     Weaver appeared in court for his arraignment the following day
before U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen Ayers.  No one was present for
the government at the arraignment nor was Weaver represented by
counsel.[FN73]

     At the arraignment, Judge Ayers discussed the appointment of
counsel with Weaver. Weaver consented to the appointment of
Everett Hofmeister, who had previously represented him on an
unrelated civil matter. Thereafter, Judge Ayers entered a not
guilty plea for Weaver and informed him that the trial was set for
February 19, 1991 in Moscow, Idaho.[FN74] Judge Ayers then addressed
the issue of pretrial release and decided to release Weaver on
certain conditions including that he "appear for all proceedings
before this Court.  And the next scheduled court appearance is, as
I said earlier, your trial in Moscow, on the 19th of February."
[FN75] In addition, Judge Ayers required Weaver to execute an 
unsecured bond in the amount of $10,000.  Judge Ayers explained 
to Weaver that if he failed to abide by any of the conditions of 
release, including the obligation to appear for trial, the United 
States could execute the bond by seizing and selling his real 
property.[FN76]

     Before releasing Weaver, Judge Ayers instructed him that he
was required to report on a regular basis to Karl Richins, the
Pretrial Service Officer, in Boise and that his first contact was
to be on January 22.[FN77] Later, Judge Ayers, in order to avoid any
misunderstanding, added Richins' name and phone number to the order
setting forth the release conditions.[FN78] Judge Ayers told Weaver
that it would be a criminal offense if he failed to appear.  Weaver
said that he understood the penalties for violating the release
conditions and that he agreed to abide by those conditions.  
Thereafter, he signed and received a copy of the
release conditions.[FN79] Weaver also signed a bond and the court
explained that the bond could be executed if he failed to appear
for trial.[FN80] Before terminating the proceeding, Judge Ayers had
Weaver confirm that his mailing address was Box 103 in Naples,
Idaho.[FN81]

b.   Events Occurring From the Arraignment Through February 20, 1991

                    (1)  Communications With Weaver

     On January 22, 1991, four days after the arraignment, Judge
Ayers sent a letter to Everett Hofmeister informing him that he had
been appointed defense counsel for Weaver, that Weaver could be
contacted at "PO Box 103, Naples, Idaho 83847" and that the trial
date was set for February 19, 1991.  A copy of this letter was sent
to Weaver.  On that same day, Weaver telephoned Karl Richins, the
U.S. Probation Officer, and informed Richins that he had been
ordered to call Richins on that date.  Richins told Weaver that he
had not received the paperwork on his case and, thus, could not
advise him about the release conditions.  Richins asked Weaver to
leave his name and phone number so that Richins could call him when
he received the case file.  According to Richins, Weaver never gave
him a phone number where he could be contacted nor could Richins
recall what understanding the parties had as to how Richins would
contact Weaver in the future.[FN82] After this conversation, 
Richins never heard from Weaver again.[FN83]

     On January 19, 1991, defense counsel Hofmeister sent a letter
to the two addresses he had for Weaver, requesting Weaver to
contact him.  Hofmeister sent similar letters to Weaver at these
addresses on January 31 and February 5.  Around February 5,
Hofmeister contacted individuals who knew Weaver and requested that
they instruct Weaver to contact Hofmeister immediately.[FN84]

     Meanwhile, in early February, the court learned that the
Weaver trial, which had been scheduled for February 19, would have
to be changed to give the participants sufficient travel time
following a federal holiday on the preceding Monday.  On February
5, the court clerk sent a notice to the parties informing them that
the trial was rescheduled for February 20, 1991.  Although this
notice was not sent directly to Weaver, a copy was sent to and
received by Hofmeister.[FN85]

     Two days later, on February 7, 1991, probation officer Richins
sent a letter to Weaver at his Naples address.  Richins wrote:

On January 18, 1991, you were released on
Pretrial Supervision pending your trial set
for March 20, 1991.  You contacted our office
and I advised you we would be getting back
with you as soon as we received the paper work
from Magistrate Ayers.  I have long ago
received the paperwork but have been unable to
locate a telephone number where I could
contact you.  Accordingly, with this letter, I
are [sic] requesting you to contact me at 334-
1630 as soon as possible.  You may call
collect if you choose.[FN86]

(Emphasis added.)

     According to Richins, he wrote the letter because he needed to
establish pretrial supervision of Weaver and had not heard from
Weaver since their January 22 phone conversation.[FN87] The only
explanation that Richins could provide for the erroneous trial date
was that it was a typographical error.  At trial, Richins expressed
regret for the error and testified that he had placed the date in
the letter as part of his effort to get Weaver to contact him.
[FN88] Weaver never responded to Richins' letter.[FN89]

     On February 8, 1991, after receiving the February 6 court
notice, Hofmeister wrote another letter urging Weaver to contact
him and informing Weaver that the trial date had been changed to
February 20.  Four days later, having still not heard from Weaver,
Hofmeister placed numerous unanswered calls to a telephone number
at which Weaver reportedly received messages.  In addition,
Hofmeister asked individuals who had contact with Weaver to ask
Weaver to contact Hofmeister immediately.  However, as of the
morning of February 20, Weaver had not contacted Hofmeister.
[FN90]

(2)  The "Queen of Babylon" Letters and the
Threat Assessment by the U.S. Marshals Service

     On February 7, 1991, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boise
received two letters signed by Vicki Weaver.  The first letter was
dated January 22, 1991 -- the same day that Weaver called Richins -
- and was addressed to "The Queen of Babylon."  It stated in part:

A man cannot have two masters.  Yahweh Yahshua Messiah,
the anointed One of Saxon Israel is our law giver and our
King.  We will obey Him and no others. . . . 'a long
forgotten wind is starting to blow.  Do you hear the
approaching thunder?  It is that of the awakened Saxon. 
War is upon the land.  The tyrants blood will flow.'[FN91]

The last quote was credited to "Mathews."

     The second letter, dated February 3, 1991, was addressed to
"Servant of the Queen of Babylon, Maurice O. Ellsworth, U.S. Attny
[sic]" and stated in part:

Yah-Yahshua the Messiah of Saxon Israel is our Advocate
and our Judge.

The stink of your lawless government has reached Heaven,
the abode of Yahweh our Yahshua.  Whether we live or
whether we die, we will not bow to your evil
commandments.[FN92]

     Ellsworth did not associate the name Vicki Weaver with any
matter pending in his office.[FN93]  However, because the language
of the letters appeared somewhat threatening, he requested the U.S.
Marshals Service in Boise ("USMS") to conduct a threat assessment
of the letters.[FN94] Deputy U.S. Marshal Warren Mays was assigned 
to perform the threat assessment.[FN95]

     After checking with state and local agencies, Mays determined
that Vicki Weaver was the wife of Randy Weaver.[FN96]  Once this
connection was made, Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Ronald Evans
convened a staff meeting, to determine how to proceed with the
threat assessment.  It was decided that Deputy U.S. Marshal David
Hunt would be assigned to assist Mays in the inquiry.[FN97]

     Thereafter, Hunt and Mays began to gather information to
enable them to prepare a "Threat Source Profile" of Weaver.[FN98]
Mays first reviewed the bail report prepared for Weaver which 
revealed that Weaver had admitted membership in the 
"Aryan Nations/Church of Jesus Christ Christian," had attended 
three Aryan World Congresses and had been wearing and Aryan 
Nations belt buckle at the time of the arrest.[FN99] In 
addition, Mays analyzed the language in the two letters 
written by Vicki Weaver and concluded that the letters
contained "rhetoric commonly associated with the Aryan
Nations/Church of Jesus Christ Christian."[FN100]  Evans 
characterized defense counsel Hofmeister as "a noted [Aryan 
Nations] attorney."[FN101]  Based on this information,
Mays initially concluded that the two letters from Vicki Weaver
contained veiled but not overt threats.[FN102]

     Mays next asked Senior Deputy U.S. Marshall Jack Cluff, the
resident officer in Moscow, Idaho, about the pending firearms
charge against Weaver.  Cluff suggested that Mays contact BATF
Agent Byerly.  Cluff also told Mays that he had learned from Lonnie
Ekstrom, a deputy in the Boundary County Sheriff's Office, that
Weaver had sent a letter to that office stating that he would not
leave his cabin and that law enforcement officers would have to
take him out.[FN103] Ekstrom recalled that in the letter the Weavers
voiced, "sentiments which indicated that [they] felt as though the
end is near and [that] the Federal Agents are watching very
closely."[FN104]

     Cluff told Mays that Byerly had described Weaver as being
"extremely uncooperative at the time of his booking" and believed
that Weaver "planned not to appear for future court proceedings."
[FN105] Byerly also reported to Cluff that Weaver:

is very adamant and very convinced in his own
mind of his religious beliefs in that the
government is posing a threat to him.  He is
very anti-government.  He believes that this
charge by the federal government against him
is the beginning of Armageddon.  The religious
war is about to begin.  The end of the world
is coming and he is ready to make his stand in
the final battle.  I would urge utmost caution
and care in his arrest.  I believe his
children are going to be armed.  If the
situation is such that they were present
during his apprehension, I believe that they
should definitely be considered to be a threat 
to the arresting officers.[FN106]

     Mays next spoke with Special Supervisory Agent Michael Kelly
who reported that the entire Weaver family, including the 12 and 14
year old children, were armed "at all times."  Kelly told Mays that
a BATF informant had indicated that the Weaver children slept with
weapons in their beds.[FN107] Neither Kelly nor anyone else in BATF
advised either Hunt or Mays that BATF had attempted to solicit
Weaver to work as an informant.  Indeed, it was not until over a
year later that the marshals learned of this action.[FN108]

     As their investigation continued, Mays was briefed by the U.S.
Secret Service on its investigation of Weaver for alleged threats
he had made against President Reagan and the Governor of Idaho in
1985.[FN109] In addition, Mays and Hunt interviewed people in the
community who might have further background information on
Weaver.[FN110] Hunt and Mays also reviewed a copy of the military
record "DD-214" for Weaver.  Although the record did not indicate
that Weaver had been a Green Beret or a member of the Special
Forces, they speculated that Weaver may have received some general
demolition training based on an indication in the record that
Weaver had training as a "combat engineer."[FN111]

     On February 11, 1991, Mays forwarded the materials that he had
gathered on Weaver to the Marshals Service Threat Analysis
Division.[FN112]  Around this time, Mays briefed Ellsworth on their
findings.  Mays told Ellsworth that they did not believe that he
was personally at risk and that they doubted that Weaver would
appear for trial.[FN113]

     When Ellsworth learned that Vicki Weaver was the wife of Randy
Weaver, he discussed the matter with Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen,
who had been assigned to the Weaver prosecution.[FN114] Ellsworth
showed Howen the January 22 letter from Vicki Weaver.  Howen
identified "the long forgotten wind" passage as not being from the
biblical book of Matthew but rather from the "Declaration of War"
written by Robert Mathews, the founder of "The Order," a white
supremacist group.[FN115] Soon after he wrote the Declaration, Mathews
was killed during a standoff with the FBI at a house on Whidbey
Island, Washington.  Shortly after Howen relayed this information
to Ellsworth, Chief Deputy Marshal Evans reported to Tony Perez,
the Chief of Enforcement Operations at Marshals Service
Headquarters, that sources within BATF had stated that Weaver had
the potential to be "another Bob Mathews and his homestead another
Whidbey Island standoff."[FN116]

c.  February 20, 1991 - The Rescheduled Trial Date

     Although the USAO continued preparing the Weaver case for
trial, members of that office were beginning to doubt that Weaver
would appear for trial.  Sometime before February 20, defense
counsel Hofmeister told Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen that he had
been unable to contact Weaver.  Based on this information, the two
letters sent by Vicki Weaver and the information developed during
the threat assessment, Howen concluded that Weaver would not appear
for trial.

     Despite the indications that Weaver would not appear for
trial, Howen told Byerly that they needed to continue preparing for
trial.  As a cautionary measure, Howen instructed Byerly to be in
court on February 19, the original trial date, in case Weaver
appeared.[FN117] Byerly was present in court on February 19, but
Weaver did not appear.  Howen insisted that he had no knowledge of
the Richins letter at the time or when he appeared in court the
following day.[FN118]

     On February 20, Howen and defense counsel Hofmeister appeared
before U.S. District Court Judge Harold L. Ryan.  At that time,
Hofmeister told the court that he had been unable to contact
Weaver.119  Hofmeister then detailed the efforts that he had taken
to communicate with Weaver.  In addition, Hofmeister said that on
the weekend before trial his answering service had received no
calls from Weaver and that none of the letters he had sent to
Weaver -- all of which had been sent by regular mail -- had been
returned.[FN120]  Howen told the court that it was his understanding
that Weaver had not kept in contact with Pretrial Services as
required.  He requested that a bench warrant be issued for Weaver's
arrest, that his bond be revoked, and that he be taken into
custody.[FN121]

     Judge Ryan, after determining that the presence specialist
had no information about whether Weaver had contacted pretrial
services, ordered that a bench warrant be issued for Weaver because
he had failed to appear for trial.[FN122] According to Judge Ryan, it
was routine practice for him to issue a bench warrant 
whenever a defendant failed to appear for trial.[FN123]  At
that time the Weaver matter had no notoriety and was "just another
case" to him.[FN124]

d.   Discovery of the Richins Letter and the
Response of the Government

     On February 26, 1991, Ken Keller, a reporter from the Kootenai
Valley Times in Bonners Ferry, Idaho, telephoned the U.S. Probation
Office and asked Duty Officer Manning whether Weaver had not
appeared for trial on February 20 because Richins had sent a letter
to him stating that the trial date was March 20.  Thereafter,
Manning apprised Terrence Hummel, the Chief Probation Officer, of
the inquiry.  When Hummel retrieved the Richins letter, he
discovered that it did, indeed, erroneously refer to the trial date
as being on March 20.[FN125]

     Hummel promptly contacted Jim Martin, Judge Ryan's law clerk,
and told him of the error in the Richins letter.[FN126]  Thereafter,
they contacted Chief Deputy Marshal Ronald Evans and notified him
of the mistake.  Evans told them that the Marshals Service "did not
intend to execute the warrant until possibly March 16" and would
agree to defer execution until March 23.[FN127]  Martin told Hummel
that he would inform Judge Ryan of the mistake and determine if he
wanted to withdraw the bench warrant.[FN128]

     In addition to notifying the court and the Marshals Service,
Hummel also informed U.S. Attorney Ellsworth of the Richins letter
and sent him a copy.[FN129]  During that conversation, Hummel 
suggested that Ellsworth not present the failure to appear
charge to the grand jury until April.  He characterized Ellsworth
as being noncommittal regarding this proposal.[FN130] Later that 
day, Hummel telephoned Hofmeister and informed him of the Richins
letter.[FN131]  In a confirming letter to Hofmeister, Hummel stated
that he had notified Judge Ryan and the USAO of the error and that
he had recommended that the warrant not be executed until after
March 20.[FN132]

     Following these discussions, Hummel returned the initial call
from reporter Keller.  In a memorandum to the file, Hummel wrote
that he told Keller that he did not know if Weaver had received the
Richins letter and that he had not indicated "one way or another
whether or not Mr. Richins had, in fact, sent that letter."[FN133]
On February 28, Keller wrote in an article that Hummel had 
disclaimed knowledge of the Richins letter.[FN134]  Hummel insisted
to investigators that he never denied the existence of the letter 
but explained that he was cautious about his statements because of 
the constraints imposed by the Bail Reform Act regarding the 
pretrial disclosure of information.[FN135]

     When Judge Ryan returned to his chambers on February 27,
Martin briefed him about the Richins letter.  Judge Ryan believed
that the arrest warrant should not be withdrawn since Hofmeister
had been informed of the change and had attempted to tell
Weaver.[FN136] Thereafter, Martin informed Evans that Judge Ryan 
did not wish to withdraw the bench warrant. According to Evans, 
Martin stated that Judge Ryan made this decision after reasoning 
that Weave had been told that the trial date was February 19 and
that Richins was without authority to change the trial date. 
Martin also told Evans that Judge Ryan wanted the Marshals Service
to bring Weaver before him during the week of March 11, since after
that time he would be unable to hear the case until late May 1991. 
[FN137]

     Sometime around February 27, Michael Johnson, the U.S. Marshal
for the District of Idaho, asked Hummel to send another letter to
Weaver informing him of the trial date error and the bench warrant
and asking him to contact the pretrial services officer
immediately.[FN138] However, Richins testified that no steps were 
ever taken to inform Weaver of the mistakes in the letter.

     On February 28, Evens met with Ellsworth, Howen and Mays to
discuss the failure of Weaver to appear for trial, the Richins
letter[FN140] and the possibility of presenting an indictment to 
the grand jury.[FN141]  According to Ellsworth, Evans was
concerned about the impact of the Richins letter and questioned
Ellsworth about how the Marshals Service should proceed.  After
this discussion, Ellsworth replied, "let's go ahead and return the
failure to appear indictment.  And if Mr. Weaver appears on March
the 20th, we may to [sic] have to dismiss it."[FN142]  Ellsworth
advised Evans that Weaver was obligated to appear on February 20
since his counsel had received the court notice with the proper
date.[FN143]

     Hunt testified at trial that the Richins letter created "a
potential here for some reasonable misunderstanding."[FN144] Hunt
explained that if Weaver had appeared on March 20, they had
contemplated that dismissal of the indictment was possible.[FN145] 
According to Mays, in light of the Richins letter, the position of
the Marshal Service was that the bench warrant and the
indictment "would be dropped" if Weaver appeared on March 20.
[FN146]

     Because of the Richins letter, the Marshals Service decided to
wait until after March 20 to effect the warrant.[FN147] In the
interim, the Marshals Service continued to gather information about
Weaver, in part to determine if contact could be made with him.
[FN148] On March 4, Hofmeister informed Evans that despite numerous 
phone calls and letters, Weaver still had not contacted him.[FN149] 
Since Weaver was not communicating with his own counsel, the 
marshals concluded that a friend of the Weavers might be more 
successful in conveying a message to them. The marshals identified 
Bill and Judy Grider as candidates for this role. The Griders lived 
in a cabin near the Weavers and were known to share philosophical 
views similar to those held by the Weavers.[FN150]

     On March 5, Hunt and Mays met with the Griders and informed
them that they had an arrest warrant for Weaver.  Bill Grider told
the marshals that Weaver believed that he was being persecuted and
would be treated unfairly if he submitted to the system.  At that
point, Judy Grider stated that Weaver had received a letter from
the court telling him that he did not have to appear until March
20.  The marshals asked the Griders to inform Weaver that they did
not want a confrontation and that he should surrender to 
authorities.  The Griders agreed to convey the message and to 
report Weaver's response.[FN151]

     Hunt and Mays met with the Griders the next day.  At that
time, Bill Grider gave the marshals a letter from Weaver, which he
said contained Weaver's response to the surrender request.  The
letter, dated March 5, 1991, was addressed to the "Servants of the
Queen of Babylon" and was signed by all five Weavers -- Randy,
Vicki, Sara, Samuel and Rachel.  It stated in part:

We, the Weaver family, have been shown by our
Savior and King, Yahshua the Messiah of Saxon
Israel, that we are to stay separated on this
mountain and not leave.  We will obey our
lawgiver and King.

You see, the Mighty One of Heaven knows his
people.  You are servants of lawlessness and
you enforce lawlessness.  You are on the side
of the One World Beastly Government.  Repent
for the Kingdom (government) of Yahweh is near
at hand.  Choose this day whom you will serve. 
As for me and my house -- we will serve Yah-
Yahshua, the King.

Whether we live or whether we die, we will not
obey your lawless government.[FN152]

     According to Bill Grider, Weaver stated that, if he dies, "he
is going home and the kids want to go with him."  When Hunt asked
Grider what would happen if he went to Weaver's cabin to arrest
him, Grider responded that Weaver had warned that "if a man enters
my property with a gun to do me harm, you can bet that I'm going to
shoot him to protect myself."[FN153]

     Evans interpreted this letter as "some type of possible
suicide pact by the [Weaver] family"154 but cautioned that it was
important that they "not read too much or too little into the
letter in its present context."[FN155] Hunt and Mays, in a Threat
Source Profile, opined that Weaver might be deliberately seeking a
confrontation with what he considered to be a "corrupt and evil
government."  They referred to several reports on file at the
Boundary County Sheriff's Office that indicated that Weaver had
fired weapons at others because of trespassing or other alleged
property disputes.  In addition, the Profile noted that, "Weaver is
armed most of the time . . . .  Sources have stated all family
members carry side arms and keep other weapons located in strategic
positions in the house and out buildings."  The Profile stated that
records indicated that Weaver had purchased four handguns, six
rifles, and two shotguns.[FN156]

     Hunt approached the Griders again on March 8 and requested
that they ask Weaver how they could avoid a confrontation.  In
addition, Hunt requested the Griders to ask Weaver to allow the
children to leave so that they would not become involved in the
dispute.  On March 11, Bill Grider called Hunt and said that Weaver
identified conditions that would have to be fulfilled in order to
resolve the controversy.  First, Weaver wanted BATF to admit that
they had behaved improperly, that they had made a mistake and that
the government was after him.  Second, Weaver wanted BATF to return
the pistol that they had allegedly "stole" from him at the time of
the arrest.  Next, Weaver wanted a written apology from Sheriff
Whittaker who had called him "paranoid" in court.  Finally, Weaver
told Grider to tell authorities that if his children could not live
in peace on the mountain then they did not want to live.[FN157]

     The last statement troubled Hunt and caused him to wonder if
Randy and Vicki Weaver might use their children as "the first
line of defense."[FN158] Evans concluded that a combination of
tactical and nontactical approaches should be considered to
apprehend Weaver.  Evans noted that a tactical approach was viewed
as the easiest to accomplish but that "it also offer[ed] the
greatest possibility of innocent casualties."  He suggested several
options including attempting discussions with Weaver by a
negotiation team comprised of a Marshals Service negotiator,
Hofmeister and Richins, or using other intermediaries, such as the
parents of Vicki Weaver, through whom to negotiate with the
Weavers.  However, in making these suggestions, Evans noted that
there were "strong indications that Weaver now mistrusts
[Hofmeister] and Richins due to conflicting information in letters
received by Weaver."  Evans also cautioned that there was "the
probability that Weaver will open fire on any law enforcement
officer or agent or ZOG ("Zionist Organized Government") once they
are identified.[FN159]

     According to U.S. Marshal Michael Johnson, sometime during the
week of March 11, Judge Ryan had a conversation with Evans
regarding the apprehension of Weaver.  At that time, Judge Ryan
reminded Evans and Johnson that they need to arrest Weaver and "get
him in his courtroom."[FN160]

e.   Decision to Present an Indictment to the Grand Jury

     U.S. Attorney Ellsworth authorized Howen to present the
failure to appear indictment to the grand jury, with the
understanding that if Weaver appeared for trial on March 20 they
"would possibly have to dismiss the indictment."[FN161]  Ellsworth
explained that dismissal would be necessary under those
circumstances, "[b]ecause the fact that he showed up would at least
create reasonable doubt in my mind and possibly in a juror's mind
as to whether or not the erroneous letter had been a basis 
for him not showing up February 20th, but showing up on March
20th."[FN162]

     Although Howen was unable to recall the specifics of the
discussions in which he participated regarding the impact of the
Richins letter, he did recall that it was their conclusion that
Weaver never intended to appear for trial on February 19 or 20, nor
would he appear for trial on March 20.  In reaching this
conclusion, they reasoned that Weaver had been specifically
informed a number of times that the trial date was February 19 and
that he had the responsibility of maintaining contact with the
probation officer and his attorney.  Despite these instructions,
Weaver failed to comply.  Moreover, Howen thought the Queen of
Babylon letters evinced an intent by Weaver to remain secluded in
his home and not appear for trial.[FN163]

     The USAO made no efforts to contact Weaver or his counsel to
discuss the Richins letter or Weaver's failure to appear.  Howen
believed that such efforts were best left to the Probation
Department and the Marshals Service.  Howen thought that they had
contacted Hofmeister and inquired whether he could persuade Weaver
to talk to him and surrender.[FN164] In addition, he recalled 
hearing that Marshal Johnson had asked Hummel to write a letter 
to Weaver explaining the mistake in the letter.[FN165]  Ellsworth 
had no discussions with the Probation Department or with the 
Marshals Service about sending a letter to Weaver informing him 
of the error.[FN166]

     With regard to the decision to present an indictment to the
grand jury, Howen stated that even when a bench warrant is
outstanding for a failure to appear, it is his policy to obtain an
indictment for the charge because the judge could withdraw the
bench warrant.  Howen believed that an indictment and arrest
warrant would give him more control over the matter and protect the
agents executing the warrant from civil liability.[FN167] Although
Ellsworth recalled that the Marshals Service wanted an
indictment, he could not remember the specific reasons for this
position.[FN168] However, Ellsworth conceded that, with the bench
warrant, the marshals did not need an indictment to have
jurisdiction over Weaver for his failure to appear.[FN169]

     Howen and Ellsworth planned to obtain a sealed indictment from
the grand jury during their session in the second week of March and
to instruct the marshals not to execute the arrest warrant until
after March 20.  If Weaver appeared for trial on March 20, both
Howen and Ellsworth were prepared to dismiss the indictment
provided Weaver had a good faith explanation as to why he had not
appeared earlier.[FN170] Howen could not recall why, with the bench
warrant outstanding, he presented the indictment on March 14
instead of waiting until the April session of the grand jury.  He
speculated that it could have been because of a scheduling conflict
that he may have had in April although he reiterated that he was
convinced that Weaver had intentionally failed to appear for trial,
a failure unrelated to the error in the Richins letter.[FN171] 
Ellsworth acknowledged that they had discussed waiting until April
1991 to present the indictment but decided not to wait since they
thought the evidence indicated that Weaver had no intention to
appear for trial on March 20.[FN172]

          3. Discussion

a.   Government Knowledge of Erroneous Richins
Letter Prior to February 20, 1991

     This investigation has found no evidence that anyone in the
government, including the USAO, was aware of the error in the
February 7 Richins letter until February 26, 1991, when the news
reporter first contacted the U.S. Probation Office.  None of the
individuals questioned indicated or suggested that such knowledge
existed prior to that time.  Nor was any other evidence obtained
from which such knowledge could be inferred.  Although Howen
instructed Byerly to monitor the courtroom on February 19, it
appears that this action was unrelated to any knowledge by Howen of
the Richins letter but rather was a precautionary measure taken by
Howen after receiving indications that Weaver might not appear for
trial.  Thus, at the earliest, government officials learned of the
error six days after Judge Ryan had issued the bench warrant on
February 20, 1991.  Consequently, we find no factual basis for the
allegation that the existence of the Richins letter was concealed
from the court on February 20, 1991.

b.   Appropriateness of Government Response to the
Richins Letter

     Four governmental agencies were involved in the Richins letter
issue:  the federal district court, which issued the bench warrant
for Weavers failure to appear; the federal probation office, which
wrote the erroneous letter; the U.S. Marshals Service, which was
responsible for apprehending Weaver on the bench warrant; and the
U.S. Attorney's Office, which was responsible for prosecuting the
firearms charges and for deciding whether an indictment should be
presented for the failure to appear charge.

     After being informed of the mistake in the Richins letter,
there was a flurry of activity by each of these entities.  Phone
conversations were initiated, meetings were conducted and memoranda
were written.  The evidence indicates that the immediate reaction
of almost all involved was that the letter was significant,
although differences of opinion existed as to the impact of the
letter and what, if any, actions should be taken.

     With regard to the role of Judge Ryan, we believe that he took
and unnecessarily rigid view of the impact of the Richins letter. 
his initial reaction to the effect of the letter was that it did
not excuse Weaver from appearing for trial.  He seemed to base his
decision on two factors.  First, Weaver had been explicitly
informed several times of the trial date yet had failed to appear
for trial.  Second, defense counsel had made numerous attempts to
contact Weaver, including to inform him of the correct change in
the trial date, but Weaver had failed to respond.  Although 
we agree that these facts provided sufficient ground upon which 
to issue the bench warrant for the failure to appear, we believe 
that the Richins letter made necessary a serious reassessment 
as to whether some corrective action should have been taken.

     We find it was not unreasonable for Weaver to assume that the
Probation Office was a government agency acting on behalf of the
court and authorized to inform him of the trial schedule.  It is
unrealistic to expect the average citizen to be versed in the
division of responsibilities within the judicial system.  We
believe that the preferable approach would have been for the
probation officer to send a corrected letter or, perhaps to have
the court clerk issue a notice acknowledging the miscommunication
and informing Weaver of the correct trial date.

     With regard to the conduct of the Probation Office, it was its
mistake that created this problem.  our investigation produced no
evidence that this error was anything but an unintentional mistake
by Richins.  Nor did we find any indication that Hummel
intentionally denied to the reporter that the erroneous letter had
been sent.  Rather, it is our conclusion that the caution of Hummel
to avoid improperly disclosing confidential information may have
caused him to couch his response in such a manner that the reporter
interpreted the response as a denial.[FN178]  However, we have
difficulty understanding why the office did not send a letter to
Weaver explaining the mistake.  Although U.S. Marshal Johnson
requested Hummel to send such a letter, Hummel did not honor this
request.

     The Marshals Service, in our view, was placed in the middle of
this controversy.  It immediately recognized the letter as a
significant matter that had a potential impact on the viability of
the bench warrant and contacted the other governmental agencies
involved and attempted to determine how best to proceed.  The
initial reaction of Chief Deputy Marshal Evans was to defer
execution of the warrant.  Marshal Johnson also wanted the
probation officer to send a letter correcting the mistake.  When
they consulted with the U.S. Attorney about how to proceed,
Ellsworth advised them that they should withhold any tactical
service of the bench warrant until after March 20, the trial date
erroneously referenced in the Richins letter.

     From the evidence presented during the investigation, it
appears that the Marshals Service sought guidance from both the
court and the U.S. Attorney's Office.  The reaction of the court
was to do nothing to correct the letter since in its view Weaver
was clearly obligated to appear.  The position of the USAO was
somewhat inconsistent.  On one hand, it argued that all indications
were that Weaver was not going to appear for trial and that the
mistake in the letter had not caused Weaver to form this intent nor
would a correction cause him to appear.  In its view, a corrected
letter would not result in Weaver's appearance.  However, on the
other hand, the USAO indicated that if it obtained an indictment
before March 20, 1991 and if Weaver appeared on or before March 20
it either "would" or "possibly would" move to dismiss the
indictment.  We think that this somewhat inconsistent position
evinces the realization that the letter might provide an
explanation for Weaver's failure to appear.

     It appears that although the USAO was consulted they never
took control of the issue or urged the sending of a letter to
Weaver identifying the error.  Such a posture was neither prudent
nor advisable.  The justification given for their inaction seemed
to be that they believed that all indications were that Weaver was
not going to appear for trial.  They maintained that Weaver had
clearly been instructed about the trial date and his obligation to
comply with all the conditions of his release.  Moreover, they
argued that Weaver's counsel, despite numerous attempts, had been
unsuccessful in his efforts to contact his client.  In addition,
Vicki Weaver, presumably with Randy Weaver's knowledge and
approval, had written and mailed two letters before the Richins
letter was sent which evidenced an intent not to appear. 
Furthermore, the Marshals Service investigation indicated that
Weaver had antigovernment views and distrusted the government. 
Finally, in response to the marshal's note requesting surrender,
Weaver sent a letter that stated that his family would"not obey
your lawless government."

     If these facts had existed without the presence of the Richins
letter, we would concur with the conclusion of the USAO that Weaver
would probably not appear for trial.  However, the facts did not
exist in a vacuum.  Even Ellsworth recognized the importance of the
letter when he instructed the marshals not to participate in any
tactical attempts to execute the warrant until March 20.  If
Ellsworth thought that the letter was without legal effect, this
instruction would have been unnecessary.  Similarly, both Ellsworth
and Howen recognized that if an indictment were obtained, it might
"possibly" have to be dismissed if Weaver appeared for trial on or
before March 20.  Their recognition that Weaver's possible
confusion about the trial date might lead to a dismissal
demonstrates that the Richins letter warranted a more active
response by the government.

     Furthermore, the fact that Weaver was known to have an intense
distrust of government might also cause one to conclude that the
letter might have intensified his distrust and contributed 
to his reluctance to appear for trial.  It is clear from 
Weaver's comments to the Griders that he received the Richins
letter.  These comments, which were relayed to the marshals,
indicated that Weaver was suspicious of what he viewed as
inconsistent messages from the government and his own counsel, and
that this inconsistency enforced his belief that the government was
conspiring against him.

     We recognize that we have the benefit of more information than
was available in 1991, and have had greater time to assess how the
government should have responded.  However, irrespective of the
advantage of hindsight, we are troubled by the rigidity of the
government's approach and the lack of leadership exhibited by the
USAO on this issue.  Although we do not believe that the response
of the government to this letter was illegal or violated Weaver's
constitutional rights, we do not understand the reasons for the
USAO not taking control of this issue and coordinating a unified
governmental response.  Indeed, it was incumbent upon the USAO to
have the Probation Office send an appropriate correction and to
have attempted to discuss the matter with the court.  Such action
would have taken little effort and would have eliminated any
question as to whether Weaver was confused.

c.   Propriety of Seeking an Indictment on March 14, 1991

     Despite the existence of an outstanding bench warrant, the
USAO decided to present an indictment to the grand jury charging
Weaver with failure to appear.  Howen decided to present the
indictment on March 14, 1991, six days before the erroneous trial
date stated in the Richins letter, because the grand jury only sat
once a month.  For reasons previously discussed, the USAO was
convinced that Weaver was not going to appear.

     As to why the USAO wanted an indictment, Howen explained that
an indictment gave him more control and protected the marshals
executing the warrant from civil liability if the court were to
withdraw the bench warrant without their knowledge.  Howen could
not recall what, if any, reasons existed for not delaying the
presentment of the indictment until the April session of the grand
jury.  This investigation found no indication that either the
Marshals Service or the court applied any pressure directly or
indirectly to the USAO as to when or whether to seek an indictment.

     We are troubled by the decision of the USAO to seek an
indictment before March 20.  Its words and actions demonstrate that
it had some concern, or at lease question, about the impact of the
Richins letter on the failure to appear charge.  We are not
persuaded by the reasons that the USAO articulated for seeking the
indictment when they did.  At the time that it sought the
indictment, a bench warrant was outstanding.  The USAO had
never received any indication that the court would withdraw the
warrant.  To the contrary, the court was firmly resolved that the
bench warrant was appropriate and should be executed.  Furthermore,
if Weaver had been arrested on the bench warrant, it is certain
that he would not have been released.  This would have enabled the
USAO to present an indictment to the next grand jury without there
being any concern that Weaver would flee.  Seeking an indictment at
the time that the USAO did created an appearance of governmental
overreaching.

          4. Conclusion

     There is no evidence that members of the USAO, the federal
probation office and Marshals Service intentionally concealed the
erroneous Richins letter from the court on February 20, 1991. 
However, we conclude that the USAO, the probation office and the
court should have appreciated the potential impact of the letter
and should have pursued simple and straight forward steps to remedy
the error.  The decision to seek an indictment prior to the March
20 date state in the letter was unnecessary and created an
impression of prosecutorial overreaching.

report also referred to preparations by Marshals Service to arrest
Weaver on March 10, 1991 with the support of state and local police
authorities.

     On that same day, Evans and Deputy Marshall Jack Cluff had a
telephone conference call with Ken Keller, the reporter from the
Kootenai Valley Times.  Keller told them that someone came into the
newspaper office and stated that Randy Weaver, his wife and
children, along with the Grider children, "are waiting at the
Weaver cabin, and are prepared to make a final stand."  Report of

Evans described the meeting as follows:

The U.S. Attorney has determined that it is in
the best interest of the Department of Justice
to withhold any tactical approach to service
of the warrant on Weaver until after March 20,
1991.  The Bench Warrant will remain in
effect. . . .

The U.S. Attorney intends to indict Weaver on
3/12/91 for FTA but admits he will most
probably be forced to dismiss the FTA
indictment prior to any trial.  Defense
counsel for Weaver has been instructed by the
Chief Judge to 'find your client and surrender
him to the U.S. Magistrate in Northern Idaho'. . . .

after Evans spoke with the United States Attorney and the ATF case
agent, it was decided "the district will delay the attempt to [sic]

indicted on March 12, 1991, and arrested after March 20, 1991."

     150 Law enforcement regarded the Griders as "more radical and
dangerous than Weaver."  See Addendum to Enforcement Division Daily
Report, February 28, 1991, at 1.  In May 1990, the Raus purchased
land that the IRS had seized as a result of tax liens.  Without the
permission of the Raus, the Weavers assisted the Griders in moving
into a cabin on this property.  Thereafter, the Raus were forced to
obtain a court order to evict the Griders from the cabin.  See

IV. SPECIFIC ISSUES INVESTIGATED

C.   Efforts by the Marshals Service to Effect the Arrest of
Weaver

          1.  Introduction

     It has been suggested that the shooting deaths of Marshal
Degan and Sammy Weaver on August 21, 1992 were the result of a
scheme by the Marshals Service to assault the Weaver property, or
at the least, the result of inadequate planning.  This inquiry
examined the scope of the Marshals Service investigation between
February 1991 and August 1992 and examined the options the marshals
considered to effect the arrest of Weaver.

          2.  Statement of Facts

a.   Involvement of the Marshals Service Special
Operations Group

     On March 18, 1991, Ronald Evans requested the assistance of
the Marshals Service Special Operations Group ("SOG").183]  SOG 
is a voluntary unit in the Marshals Service specifically trained to
handle dangerous or complex matters, such as hostage situations
involving fugitives.[FN184] Evans compared the Weaver situation to 
the violence surrounding the attempted arrest of Gordon Kahl when 
Evans was Chief Deputy of the North Dakota District.[FN185]  He 
added that many days/nights of surveillance would be necessary to 
determine the Weavers' daily routine and asked for SOG assistance 
in determining how to arrest Weaver "while minimizing risk to all 
persons involved. . . . Ultimately, we must find a single 
weakness which will cause Randy Weaver to leave the house if 
only momentarily."[FN186]

     On March 23, 1991, Evans briefed SOG Commander John Haynes,
Deputy Commander Louis E. Stagg, and other SOG personnel.[FN187] At
that time, Stagg asked Evans about the pressure he was under to
apprehend Weaver, and Evans replied that a "very senior Judge" was
not going to tolerate delay in capturing Weaver.[FN188]  It was
tentatively agreed that an SOG reconnaissance team would travel to
Idaho in mid-June to gather information for a plan to arrest
Weaver.  Haynes directed that Stagg lead the mission.[FN189]

     SOG also retained the services of Dr. Walter F. Stenning,
Ph.D., a psychologist, to construct a psychological profile of
Randy Weaver.  Dr Stenning concluded:

In my best professional judgement, Mr. Randall
(sic) would be an extreme threat to any police
officer's attempt to arrest (sic) him. 
Further, Mr. Randall (sic) has indoctrated
(sic) his family into a belief system that the
end of the world is near and that his family
must fight the fences (sic) for evil that want
to take over the world.  I believe his family
may fight to the death.  If Mr. Randall (sic)
is captured by your force, I feel the
remaining members of the family will use all
force necessary including deadly force to
regain Mr. Randall's (sic) freedom.  Also, all
evidence indicates that the Randalls' (sic)
home and surrounding property is defensively
fortified to repel assault.  In summary, my
best professional judgement is that Mr.
Randall (sic) and family will resist and have
the means to resist all but a military type
assault.  Further, even with a military type
assault the family will fight, possibly to the
death.  It seems most effective to wait until
Mr. Randall (sic) leaves his house and is
alone to make the arrest on the Federal
warrant.[FN190]

b.   SOG Reconnaissance and Recommendations

     Between June 17 and 24, 1991, the SOG reconnaissance team
assessed the Weaver case in Idaho.  SOG Deputy Commander Staff was
accompanied by Deputy Marshals Cody Thorpe and Larry Ely.  They
reviewed the files of the local marshals and met BATF agents,
Forest Service representatives, the local sheriff, and others. 
BATF Agents Byerly and Kelly told them that "Weaver and his entire
family will react violently to any attempt by the USMS to arrest
Weaver and that Vicki Weaver and the children should be considered
just as dangerous as Weaver."  Kelly also reported that Weaver had
plans to remove himself and his family to caves in the mountain.
[FN191] Byerly speculated that Weaver might leave the property to 
attend the upcoming Aryan World Congress.[FN192]

     Sheriff Whittaker told the SOG reconnaissance team that he
thought Weaver feared that the government would take his property
through forfeiture of the bail bond and might kill his family in an
assault to arrest him.  In addition, Whittaker also told Staff that
Weaver had threatened his neighbors, the Raus.[FN193]  Whittaker,
however, did not "completely share the assessment of other (law
enforcement) agencies that Weaver is completely beyond rational
reasoning and will fight to the death."[FN194]

     Stagg briefed Marshal Johnson and U.S. Attorney Ellsworth
about his findings.  He recommended against a tactical assault on
the Weaver compound because of possible injury to the marshals and
the women and children.  Instead, it was his recommendation that
the indictment be dismissed and then refiled later under seal. 
Staff also cautioned that an attack must be forceful to eliminate
the risk of Weaver escaping into the woods, where he would pose
more of a threat.[FN195] Thereafter, Stagg requested an opportunity 
to present his findings to Chief Judge Ryan but Ellsworth refused 
the request.[FN196]  Stagg told Hunt that this "was the worse 
(sic) situation he had seen in 23 years."[FN197]

     The SOG team set forth its findings in a Law Enforcement
Operations Order, which portrayed the situation as exceedingly
difficult and Weaver as "extremely dangerous and suicidal."  The
team concluded that:

Weaver has been preparing for five months
[since his arrest by BATF] for his war or
confrontation with law enforcement and it is
very likely that he has established numerous
fortifications and defensive positions on his
property.  It is also possible that Weaver has
placed booby traps and/or command detonated
explosive devices on routes of approach or
concealment.

     The report set forth a proposal to arrest Weaver with "a
minimal risk of loss of life" and "minimum force necessary to
effect arrest."  The proposed plan contemplated use of
reconnaissance teams to determine whether Weaver could be arrested
away from his residence, wife and children.  If that were not
feasible, the team would gather intelligence necessary to implement
a "tactical movement" with armored vehicles.[FN198]

     Following the submission of the report, SOG took no additional
action until Evans again requested SOG's assistance in effecting
Weaver's arrest.  On September 25, 1991, Evans wrote:

Patience and negotiations have not been
rewarded in the instant matter.  We have
communicated with the Weaver family through 
his family, friends, and his attorney.  We
have provided him with multiple opportunities
to surrender to this office, the local
sheriff, or to his court appointed counsel. . . . 
One option remains and should be exercised
quickly.  We still need to verify Weaver's
existence on the property and test his
dedication.  In testing the latter, it must be
done with a careful balance to limit and
minimize risk to law enforcement, the Weaver
family members, and to Randall Weaver. 
Without experimentation, we are stymied and
without answers. . . . While time may have
initially been on our side, it has now turned
against us.  We are within thirty days from
being locked out of the area by climatic
factors.  If we avoid this opportunity, it
will be May, to June, 1992 before any course
of action can be initiated.  I seriously doubt
the court will reasonably wait until 1992 for
the initial endeavor to serve the warrant.[FN199]

     Evans then asked that a team of SOG members be dispatched to
the Weaver property to contact Randy Weaver.  He envisioned their
role as follows:

They will be instructed to arrest Weaver
without injury to themselves or any other
person.  If they determine that this cannot be
accomplished without life threatening
circumstances, they will be instructed to
leave the immediate area without delay. ...[FN200]

     On September 28, 1991, a seven man SOG detail was dispatched
to assist in arresting Weaver.  However, upon arrival, the team
concluded that "the information upon which the SOG move order was
issued was inaccurate," and the plan to arrest Weaver was
cancelled.[FN201]

     Thereafter, the team gathered additional information and
learned that Vicki Weaver was pregnant and close to delivery.  In
addition, the team reported that Weaver was still on the mountain
and that the situation was as dangerous as before.  It also
concluded that "it [was] very likely that any attempt to arrest
Weaver at his property will result in an armed gun battle and
subsequent loss of life."[FN202]

               c.   Additional Contacts with Intermediaries

     On July 9, 1991, Deputy U.S. Marshal Cluff and Everett
Hofmeister, Weaver's appointed counsel, told Rodney Willey, a
Weaver associate, that if Weaver surrendered, the failure to appear
charge might be dismissed.[FN203]  They also told Willey that the
sentence on the weapons offense would be minimal because Weaver did
not have a criminal record.  On July 10, Willey informed Hofmeister
that Weaver would not surrender because "[his] rights will be
violated."[FN204]

     In late September 1991, Hunt and Ely interviewed Beverly and
Ed Torrence, who owned land adjacent to the Weaver property.  The
Torrences explained that they had encountered the Weavers a few
days earlier when they had gone up to view their property.  At that
time, the Torrences drove near the Weaver house and stopped to ask
about some property markers.  The Weaver dogs came to their car,
followed by Sammy Weaver, who called to the house.  The Torrences
then saw Randy Weaver and "Dennis" looking down on them from a rock
outcropping.[FN205] Each held a rifle or shotgun.  Thereafter, the
Torrences were invited into the Weaver cabin where Randy and Vicki
Weaver explained their religious and political views.

     Randy Weaver told the Torrences that the Aryans are the true
chosen people of Yahweh and that the Jews are impersonators.[FN206]
He claimed that a federal informant had introduced him to the Aryan
Nations.  Weaver also discussed the BATF arrest and that he was
expecting federal agents to come to his home, but that he was not
going to be arrested by anyone.  According to Weaver, he and his
family would shoot federal law enforcement officials who came on
his property.  "If they do take me, I'll take some with me," and
that is "[w]hy we have the guns."  Beverly Torrence observed that
Weaver appeared "vehement in his belief that he would rather fight
than go peaceable (sic)."[FN207]

     During this period, the marshals also received information
that Weaver might attend the America's Promise Ministry, a
suspected Aryan Nations church, in Sandpoint, Idaho.  The Marshals
Service began surveillance of the church, but Weaver was not
seen.[FN208]

               d.   Exchange of Surrender Terms

     On October 9, 1991, Deputy Marshal Mays interviewed Alan
Jeppeson, who had been observed bringing supplies and mail to the
Weaver cabin.[FN209]  Mays asked Jeppeson to convey another 
negotiation offer to the Weavers. A series of exchanges followed. On
October 12, 1991, Jeppeson gave Mays a letter from the Weavers which
stated:

The U.S. Government lied to me - why should I
believe anything its servants have to say . . . .  
This situation was set up by a lying
government informant whom your lawless courts
will honor.  Your lawless One World Beast
courts are doomed.  I have appealed to
Yahweh's court of Supreme Justice.  We will 
stay here separated from you & your lawless 
evil in obedience to Yahshua the Messiah.[FN210]

     Jeppeson told Hunt that Weaver did not want to be tried in
Idaho "due to prejudice against those who believed in separation of
the white race."[FN211] According to Jeppeson, Weaver might 
surrender, if the trial could be moved and if Jeppeson could 
remain with Weaver until he was released or sentenced.[FN212]

     Thereafter, the Marshals Service began to formulate a
surrender offer.  This offer included promises that: the government
would not interfere with Vicki Weaver's custody of her children;
[FN213] the Marshals Service would not harass Randy Weaver's 
family; and the Government would not move to forfeit Randy Weaver's
property.[FN214]  

     The following day, Jeppeson delivered a letter from Vicki
Weaver, addressed to Mays and Hunt, that posed a number of
questions, including:


1.   Why a government informant or agent cannot be
cross-examined by a defense attorney?

2.   Why did the U.S. Dist. Judge in Coeur D'Alene
tell [the Weavers] that if [they] lost [their]
case [they] would lose the $10,000 bond to pay
the attorney?[FN215]

3.   Why is there a concerted effort to 'set up'
for prison or murder all ex-green berets
(Special Forces).  My husband is an ex-green
beret.  We know there are those already in
prison from 'set ups.'  They all went to court
expecting justice from the courts of the
country they loved.  They didn't receive any! . . . .

(Emphasis in original.)  Jeppeson told the marshals that he thought
that Weaver would agree to meet Hunt.

     On October 16, 1991, Evans and Hunt gave Jeppeson a letter to
give to Randy Weaver that responded to the questions Vicki Weaver
had raised.  Later that same day, Jeppeson gave Hunt a brief
response signed by Vicki Weaver, which declared "[t]here is nothing
to discuss.  [Randy] doesn't have to prove he is innocent.  Nor
refute your slander."[FN216]

               e.   Post-Negotiation Investigation

     In October 1991, Hunt and Evans drafted a letter to Weaver,
for Marshal Johnson's signature, containing proposed surrender
terms.  They sent the letter to the USAO for review.[FN217] 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen rejected the proposal on October 
15, 1992 and explained in a subsequent letter that:


[I] cannot authorize further negotiations or
discussions along this line with defendant or
his agent for two reasons.  First, since the
defendant is represented by Everett C.
Hofmeister, appointed counsel, all contact
with the defendant must be through his lawyer
and not by ex parte means.  Department of
Justice policy and the Cannons (sic) of Ethics
prohibit direct or indirect contact with a
defendant who is represented by counsel for
any negotiation purpose.  Second, the . . .
areas of proposed negotiation are either not
within my power to grant or bind the
government, to (sic) broad in their scope, or
are the type of matters properly addressed in
a plea agreement in exchange for guilty
pleas, but not mere surrender.[FN218]

As a result of Howen's directive, the Marshals Service did not send
the proposed letter.

     Following the termination of negotiations, Hunt continued to
gather information.  He determined that Weaver had "set an
approximate 100 yard perimeter around his house" that gave him
"high ground coverage of 360 degrees."  Hunt described Weaver's
routine:

 Weaver's tactics appear to be that he and
[Kevin] Harris will cover any intruders [on
the property] from a distance until they are
identified. . . . In most cases Weaver will
send his son or Harris to investigate a
situation while Weaver covers them.  Weaver
also has a very aggressive dog that will warn
them if someone is approaching.[FN219]

     There was very little activity by the marshals on the Weaver
matter through the winter months because the property was snowed
in, and surveillance was not practical.[FN220]  However, they 
continued to receive information about who was visiting the 
Weaver property.

     On March 1, 1992, the Spokesman Review, a newspaper in nearby
Spokane, Washington, reported that Weaver's children were armed and
quoted area residents who predicted violence if law enforcement
agents attempted to apprehend Weaver.  Allan Jeppeson was quoted as
saying, "They'll lose their lives if they go up there and threaten
Weaver" and "he don't want nobody on his mountain."[FN221]

     On March 4, 1992, Cluff and Evans traveled to the Rau house to
obtain an update on Weaver's activities and to check on the status
of a telephone being installed there at the Marshal Service's
expense.  Once there, Cluff and Evans decided to drive up the
mountain road leading to the Weaver cabin.[FN222]  They were in 
plain clothes and rode in an unmarked four-wheel drive vehicle.  
As they proceeded up the mountain road, the marshals found that 
vehicle noise on the unmaintained road was clearly audible for great
distances.  When they reached the top of the road, by the entrance
to the Weaver property, they saw signs reading, "White Power is
Supreme" and "Bow Down to Yahweh."

     Cluff and Evans then saw Randy Weaver, armed with a rifle, and
a boy and a girl standing above them on a rock formation.  The boy
also had a rifle.  A yellow dog ran up to the vehicle, 
barking.[FN223] When Weaver told them they were trespassing, they 
responded that they were interested in buying property. Weaver told
them to return with a realtor.  Cluff and Evans left.[FN224]

     Thereafter, Evans determined that additional reconnaissance
was necessary.  He had learned of previously unknown trails to the
Weaver property and believed it was necessary to explore them.

      f.   Briefing of the Marshals Service Director

     A meeting was held on March 27, 1992 at Marshals Service
Headquarters to brief Acting Director Henry Hudson and other
officials, including Duke Smith, Associate Director for Operations,
Tony Perez, Chief of the Enforcement Division, Inspectors Arthur
Roderick and William Hufnagel of the Enforcement Division, Deputy
Marshals John Haynes and Lou Staff of SOG, and Marshal Johnson.

     At the meeting, Haynes and Stagg presented a plan for an
assault on the Weaver compound, but recommended against taking such
action.  Hudson agreed that a tactical approach did not appear
viable because of their concern for the safety of Vicki Weaver and
her children.[FN225]

     As an alternative, Hudson telephoned U.S. Attorney Ellsworth
and asked him to consider dismissing the warrant against Weaver and
reissuing it under seal.  Hudson thought this would relieved the
pressure to arrest Weaver and might cause Weaver to believe it was
safe to come off the mountain.  Hudson explained to Ellsworth that
Weaver could then be arrested without launching an assault on the
compound and risking injury to the children and to government
personnel.

     Ellsworth told Hudson that he thought it would be unethical to
dismiss the indictment and then reindict Weaver in secret.[FN226] 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen said they could not dismiss the
indictment because Judge Ryan was calling for Weaver's arrest.
[FN227] In response, Hudson offered to travel to Boise to meet 
Judge Ryan, but his offer was not accepted.[FN228]

     Unable to resolve the matter in this fashion, Hudson ordered
that any plan adopted should avoid potential harm to Vicki Weaver
and the Weaver children.  He believed that a "ruse" arrest would be
ore likely to achieve this goal than an "operational" 
strategy.[FN229]

     Thereafter, the Weaver case was transferred to the Enforcement
Division and was given the name "Operation Northern Exposure."  The
primary responsibility for developing a plan was given to Deputy
Marshal Arthur Roderick, Branch Chief of the Enforcement
Division.[FN230]

      g.   Development of Three Phase Operational Plan

     After considerable discussion with the Idaho District and
Headquarters, Roderick and Hufnagel devised a three phase plan for
arresting Weaver.  Under Phase I, a team of marshals would assess
the feasibility of technical surveillance of the Weaver cabin and
property.[FN231] This would necessitate inspection of the Weaver
property to determine the surveillance equipment that could be
used.[FN232] A team comprised of Roderick, Hufnagel, and Deputy U.S.
Marshals Mark Jurgenson, Ron Libby, and Dave Hunt, was assembled to
carry out Phase I.[FN233]

           (1)  Phase I

     At the beginning of Phase I, Roderick rented a condominium on
Schweitzer Mountain, approximately 25 miles from the Weaver
property which was to serve as a command post.  The team also spent
several days conducting surveillance of the Weaver house from the
north and west ridges and looking for sites on which to 
mount surveillance cameras.  During this process, they observed the
Weavers responding to certain noises by running with rifles to a
rock ledge that overlooked the driveway.[FN234]

     On one occasion during Phase I, Roderick nearly had an
encounter with Kevin Harris.  While Roderick was in the woods near
the north ridge observation post, he saw Harris ride nearby on a
motorcycle and past the unmarked marshal's truck.  When Roderick
returned to the truck the tires on the truck were flat.[FN235]

           (2) Phase II

     On April 13, 1992, Roderick and Hufnagel briefed Acting
Director Hudson on the results of Phase I of the plan to arrest
Weaver.[FN236] While Hudson was shown photographs of the area,
Hufnagel described the locations of surveillance cameras, which
would provide information about the Weavers' daily routine. 
Information obtained from the surveillance cameras during Phase II
was expected to assist the Marshals Service in developing options
for Phase III of the plan, which was the arrest of Weaver.[FN237] 
In addition, Hudson was informed that the assistance of
five additional marshals was needed for Phase II.[FN238]  Acting
Director Hudson approved Phase II on or about April 13, 1992.  The
Phase II Plan noted that Kevin Harris was now living in the Weaver
cabin.  Harris was described as "an ardent supporter of Weaver's
[who] thinks of [Weaver] as his father."[FN239]

     On April 18, the marshals installed surveillance cameras on
the west ridge and, on April 22, they installed the cameras on the
north ridge.  Soon thereafter the cameras became operational after
a number of technical problems had to be solved.[FN240] The marshals
had to make several trips to the camera sites, often in darkness,
to bring the heavy batteries needed to power the cameras.[FN241]

     During Phase II, the team also made three trips onto the
Weaver property to survey the terrain because little was known
about the land surrounding the Weaver cabin.  Each trip began
before daybreak and the marshals used night vision equipment.[FN242]
Although aerial photographs portrayed the land as flat, it 
was actually heavily wooded and frequently steep and
rugged.

     The closest that the marshals got to the cabin was during the
third trip in the first week of May.  While it was still dark,
Roderick, Hunt and Libby took the "East Trail," which ended behind
the Weaver cabin.  They then passed some water tanks a few yards
from the cabin and worked their way down to the spring house by the
lower garden.  This was the first time any marshal had circled the
Weaver house and viewed the surrounding grounds.  While they were
in the lower garden area, Libby spotted a small dog, who was
"yapping", but who stopped when the marshals took cover.[FN243]

     During this period, Buster Kittel, a private citizen, went to
the mountain to survey property he had recently purchased.  To
reach his property, he had to drive past the Weaver cabin.  As he
reached the Weaver driveway, Kittel heard a shot from a small
caliber gun and saw Sammy Weaver standing above him with a rifle on
a rock outcropping.  Randy then joined Sammy, holding a pistol and
a rifle.  Weaver asked Kittel if he was a federal marshal and
directed Kittel's girlfriend to get out of the truck.  Weaver told
Kittel that he did not believe that Kittel had bought property and
told him to come back with proof.  The next day Kittel returned
with some paperwork, which he showed to Vicki Weaver.  The Weavers
then allowed Kittel to proceed to his property.[FN244]

     Video tapes produced from the surveillance cameras during
Phase II were sent to Headquarters which had directed the cameras
to continue to be operated.  Because the batteries were running
low, the marshals decided to replace them with solar panels, which
were installed on May 1 and 2.  Kevin Harris apparently heard the
marshals working on the north ridge and was seen looking up at the
area.  A few days later the camera on the north ridge stopped
transmitting.  Upon investigation, Roderick and two other marshals
discovered that the camera equipment had been stolen.[FN245]

     On April 13, 1992, the Marshals Service was informed that a
crew from "Now It Can Be Told," a television program hosted by
Geraldo Rivera, may have been shot at while flying over the Weaver
property in a helicopter.[FN246]  Two weeks later, Randy and Vicki
Weaver were interviewed on May 2, 1992 by Michael Weland, a local
newspaper reporter.  Vicki said that the mountain had been given to
them by "Yahweh" and that "We will not leave our mountain."[FN247]
Weland also quoted Vicki as saying that her family feared that
Randy would "be railroaded through the court and once he was gone
[the government] would have come it, kicked us off the property and
torn this place apart."  Randy Weaver was quoted in the same
article as stating that: "Right now, the only thing they can take
away from us is our life.  Even if we die, we win.  We'll die
believing in Yahweh."[FN248]

           (3)  Transition to Phase III

     After Phase II of the operation had been completed, Roderick
and Hufnagel developed two alternative plans for capturing Weaver,
one "lethal," the other "non-lethal."  Both proposals involved
teams of marshals surrounding the cabin and forcing Weaver outside. 
The plans differed in that, under the "lethal" plan, the teams
would be armed while under the "non-lethal" plan, they would use
rubber bullets and other passive strategies, such as cutting off
the water supply to the cabin.[FN249]

     Acting Director Hudson was briefed on the options for Phase
III.[FN250] Deputy Attorney General George Terwilliger, who happened
to be present at Headquarters, also attended the meeting.  When
Hudson asked what the marshals would do if the Weaver children
fired at them, Roderick responded that they would defend
themselves.  Terwilliger found this "unacceptable."[FN251] Hudson
rejected both the "lethal" and the "non-lethal" plans out of fear
for the children's safety.[FN252]

     Thereafter, Roderick developed an undercover plan to arrest
Weaver, which required two marshals to assume the roles of husband
and wife and to purchase a plot of land north of the Weaver
property.  To provide security for the marshals, the land purchase
would have legitimate paperwork.  In addition, the undercover
marshals would clear the property to create the impression that
they were authentic purchasers.  Five two-man teams would accompany
the undercover marshals to the mountain on each visit and provide
cover from the woods.[FN253]  The plan assumed that Weaver would become
accustomed to the undercover marshals, leading to an opportunity to
arrest him out of the presence of the other family members.  The
marshals believed that it might take up to a year to secure
Weaver's arrest.[FN254]

     Although final approval was needed from Acting Director
Hudson, Roderick was given permission by Jim Roach, Deputy Director
for Operations, in late May 1992, to begin preparations for the
undercover operation.  Roderick chose Deputy Marshal Mark Jurgensen
of the Seattle office for the undercover role.  Roderick,
Jurgensen, and Hunt started assembling documents necessary to carry
out the ruse.[FN255]

      h.   Delay in Implementing the Undercover Operation

     Roderick was instructed not to put the undercover plan into
effect while Hudson's confirmation was pending before the U.S.
Senate.[FN256] In early August 1992, Hudson was confirmed Director 
of the Marshals Service and gave oral approval of the undercover
operation shortly thereafter.[FN257]  Because there had been no
surveillance of the Weaver property since May, Roderick thought it
necessary for a team to visit the site and update their
information.[FN258]

 3.  Discussion

     A number of allegations has been raised about the conduct of
the Marshals Service between February 1991 and August 1992.  We
examine in this section these allegations.

a.   The Initial Response of the Marshals Service
to Weaver's Failure to Appear

     Before the failure to appear indictment was returned, Judge
Ryan issued a bench warrant and directed the Marshals Service to
arrest Weaver.  Judge Ryan declined to withdraw the warrant when he
learned that the Probation Office had sent Weaver a letter with an
incorrect trial date.  After the indictment was returned,
Ellsworth rebuffed Hudson's request to dismiss the indictment and
return it under seal.

     We appreciate the problem the Marshals Service faced.  It
could not ignore the Court's order or the indictment and, thus, had
no choice but to take steps to apprehend Weaver to face the pending
charges.  Indeed, Former Director Hudson has explained that the
Marshals Service has no independent role in evaluating charges when
it is called upon to apprehend a fugitive.[FN259] In addition, this
investigation has found that simply leaving Weaver on the mountain,
despite its facial appeal, was not an option available to the
Marshals Service once charges had been instituted.[FN260] Moreover,
the marshals had a legitimate concern that the Weavers were
harassing their neighbors, the Raus.  Indeed, by August 1992, it
was feared that if Weaver were allowed to remain at large, there
would be an incident in which the Raus, or other innocent problems,
might be harmed.[FN261]

     Notwithstanding the need to apprehend Weaver, it appears at
initial glance that the resources the marshals committed to the
case were disproportionate to the relatively insignificant
underlying charge.[FN262] However, at the same time, we recognize
that no one, including Randy Weaver, is entitled to ignore the rule
of law.  Thus, all factors considered, we acknowledge that the
Marshals Service had no option but to respond.

     Because the Marshals Service had no option but to pursue
Weaver's arrest and because that arrest posed possible injury to
law enforcement and to the Weavers, it was incumbent on other law
enforcement agencies and the court to assist the Marshals Service
in resolving the impasse.  As we note below, the Marshals Service
received little practical assistance from the U.S. Attorney's
Office which also hindered communications with the court.  We are
troubled that no agency or individual took action in response to
the concerns of the Marshals Service.


b.   Considerations by Marshals Service of
Alternatives to Secure the Arrest of Weaver

     The Marshals Service employed many different options for
securing Weaver's arrest before settling on a plan in May 1992. 
The record is replete with discussions of proposals made by
different components of the Marshals Service.  Its approach was
extraordinarily cautious.

     Common to each strategy the Service considered was a concern
for the safety of the Weaver children and the arresting marshals. 
For this reason, a tactical approach, that is, an armed raid on the
residence, was considered unrealistic by Idaho marshals as early as
March 1991.  The Special Operations Group reached the same
conclusion in June 1991 and again in September 1991 after reviewing
a psychological profile of Weaver and conducting its own
investigation in Northern Idaho.[FN263] In March 1992, Director 
Hudson ruled out any "tactical" or "operational" strategy that did 
not eliminate the possibility of harm to Vicki Weaver or her 
children. Hudson even rejected a "non-lethal" tactical plan, which
contemplated the use of rubber bullets, because it involved an
assault on the cabin and, therefore, posed a potential danger to
the children.[FN264]

     The problem of "innocent casualties" arose out of a mass of
evidence that Weaver and his family were armed and determined not
to submit to authorities without a fight.  For example, BATF
informed the marshals that Weaver had resisted its "ruse" arrest in
December 1990, had attempted to grab a weapon during the arrest,
and had declared that he would not be tricked again.  BATF had also
reported that Weaver and his family were armed "at all times" and
could present a danger to arresting officers.  Additional
information collected by BATF suggested that Weaver thought the end
of the world was approaching and that he was prepared for a final
battle on his property.  Weaver's military record revealed that he
may have received demolition training, and the marshals feared that
he had established fortifications and defensive positions on his
property.[FN265]  Weaver also had written to the Boundary County
Sheriff that he would not leave his cabin and that law enforcement
agents would have to take him out.[FN266]  The "Queen of Babylon"
letter sent to U.S. Attorney Ellsworth had quoted a "Declaration of
War" by a white supremacist who had died in a violent confrontation
with law enforcement officers.  Frank Kumnick, the leader of a
local Aryan Nations church and a friend of Randy Weaver, had told
Mays that Weaver spoke of having a violent confrontation with the
law since 1984 and that Vicki and Randy Weaver had "ideas of
martyrdom."[FN267] In addition, there were reports that the Weaver
children were well trained in the use of firearms and would protect
their father if an arrest were attempted on the property.[FN268] 
Surveillance showed that the Weavers responded to the noise of
approaching vehicles by running with rifles to a rock ledge.[FN269]
Various intermediaries had reported that Weaver repeatedly said
that he would not leave his property and that he would shoot
intruders if he thought it necessary to protect his family. 
Finally, the Weavers signed a letter stating that the Weaver
children would not leave the mountain.[FN270]

     This list illustrates the data the Marshals Service had
collected and is by no means exhaustive.  We found no
countervailing evidence that Weaver would surrender peacefully. 
Accordingly, we believe that the wariness of the Marshals Service
was justified.

     In addition, we believe that the caution of the Marshals
Service also stemmed from its experience with Gordon Kahl, the head
of Posse Comitatus.  When the Marshals Service attempted to arrest
Kahl in 1983, a firefight erupted in which two marshals were killed
and Kahl and his son were wounded.[FN271] Chief Deputy Ron Evans was
Chief Deputy of the North Dakota District when the Kahl incident
occurred and compared the Weaver matter to the Kahl case.[FN272]

     In view of the disadvantages attending a "tactical" approach,
the marshals began to explore "non-tactical" alternatives.  In
March 1991, Evans discussed sending a negotiator to the Weaver
cabin under a "white flag."  However, the approach was abandoned
because it was believed that Weaver would "fire on any law
enforcement officer or agent of [the Zionist Organized
Government]."[FN273]

     Both the Special Operations Group and Director Hudson asked
U.S. Attorney Ellsworth to dismiss the indictment against Weaver
and to re-issue it under seal to reduce the pressure to arrest
Weaver and to trick him into leaving his property so that he could
be arrested without risk to the children.  Ellsworth and Howen
refused Hudson's request.[FN274]

     The marshals also pursued information that Weaver might leave
his property to attend a suspected Aryan Nations church.  The
marshals began surveillance of the church but Weaver did not
appear.[FN275]

     Beginning in October 1991, Mays and Evans initiated a series
of communications with Randy Weaver through various intermediaries,
such as the Jeppesons, Griders, and Vicki's parents, the Jordisons. 
The marshals and Weaver also exchanged surrender terms.  However,
Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen ended these discussions in October
1992, directing that all communication with Weaver be through his
counsel.

     The "non-tactical" arrest plan that Director Hudson finally
approved in the Summer of 1992 was passive almost in the extreme. 
Indeed, the marshals were willing to wait up to a year for an
undercover marshal to gain Weaver's trust.  Under this plan,
"cover" teams of marshals would arrest Weaver only if he could be
taken into custody without harm to his family.[FN276]

     We do not believe that the Marshals Service acted
precipitously or unreasonably in developing its plan to arrest
Weaver.  The Marshals Service examined many alternatives in
devising its course of action.  Some options were foreclosed by
other agencies; others were thought to be too dangerous.  The
Marshals Service eventually decided to pursue a non-tactical arrest
which posed the least threat of physical violence.  However, the
Marshals Service recognized that with any plan that it considered,
a potential risk of violence existed considering Weaver's threats
to resist arrest violently.

c.   Pressure Exerted on Marshals Service to Arrest
Weaver

     This investigation also examined whether the manner in which
the Marshals Service treated the charges against Weaver was
affected by improper, external influences.

(1) The Court

     Judge Ryan issued a bench warrant for Weaver's arrest
following his failure to appear for trial.  When he learned a week
later that Pretrial Services had sent Weaver a letter bearing an
incorrect trial date, Judge Ryan declined to withdraw the warrant. 
Judge Ryan, who characterized Weaver as "just another case," told
this investigation that he was satisfied that Weaver knew of the
February 20 trial date.  According to Judge Ryan, it was routine
for him to issue a bench warrant when defendants did not appear for
trial.[FN277]

     Judge Ryan denies pressuring the Marshals Service to arrest
Weaver.  He explained that he already had a full caseload and "was
in no hurry to get Weaver arrested."  In fact, Judge Ryan said that
he thought scarce judicial resources were being wasted on the large
number of gun cases brought in federal court and, in particular, he
complained about undercover "sting" cases involving firearms. 
Judge Ryan recalled a few casual conversations with Evans about the
Weaver case and once spoke "in jest to Evans [about] when was he
going to get his job done," in reference to executing the Weaver
bench warrant.  However, he claimed that he did not urge anybody
"to hurry up and get Weaver before the court."[FN278]

     Deputy Marshals Hunt and Evans do not believe that the Court
exerted undue pressure on the Service,[FN279] and we have found 
little or no evidence to the contrary.

(2)  The Media

     The marshals were sensitive to public opinion about the Weaver
case.  Several marshals were concerned about the public perception
of the marshals and Weaver in Northern Idaho.  In October 1991,
Hunt wrote:

 Weaver is losing support locally from his
friends and associates.  They believe he is
becoming very paranoid and suspects everyone
is informing on him.  The USMS is receiving
growing support in the way that we have
handled this situation.  The community seems
to be impressed with the USMS not over
reacting and their concerns for the safety of
all involved.  An approach of even handiness
(sic) and concern has began (sic) to impress
even hard core Aryan types.[FN280]

     In March 1992, an article appeared in the Spokesman Review, a
newspaper in nearby Spokane, Washington, marking the one-year
anniversary of the bench warrant.  The Chicago Tribune published a
similar article on the same day, which described Weaver as a "folk
hero" holding the Marshals Service at bay.[FN281]  According to 
Evans, "pressure from USMS headquarters to effect the arrest of 
Weaver increased substantially after these two articles."[FN282] He 
did not believe, however, that Headquarters compelled the marshals 
to take actions that placed the Weavers or the marshals in undue 
danger, and this investigation has uncovered no evidence to the
contrary.[FN283]  Indeed, this regard for local sentiment does not 
seem to have had a significant impact on the marshals' handling of 
the case.  If anything, it made them more leery of proceeding
precipitously.

           (3)  The U.S. Attorney's Office

     The USAO, in particular U.S. Attorney Ellsworth and Assistant
U.S. Attorney Howen, played a large role in shaping the Marshals
Service's approach to arresting Weaver.  However, Ellsworth and
Howen did little, if anything, to facilitate the marshals'
assignment.  To the contrary, in more than one instance, they made
decisions or took actions that made the marshals' task more
difficult.

                (i)  Halting Negotiations

     In October 1991, Mays and Evans began a series of
communications with Weaver through intermediaries and exchanged
terms of surrender with him.  Howen directed the marshals to
discontinue contact with Weaver because he was represented by
counsel, thus, effectively foreclosing communication.  Although we
are not convinced that these negotiations would have been
successful if pursued, we find that Howen's decision was erroneous
and unduly hampered the marshals' efforts.

     Howen's statement that contacts with a represented person are
prohibited are accurate but incomplete.  For example, Disciplinary
Rule 7-104(A)(1) of the ABA Model Code of Professional
Responsibility and its successor, Rule 4.2 of the ABA Model Rules
of Professional Conduct, provide that an attorney shall not
communicate with a party represented by counsel, unless the
attorney has the consent of counsel or is "authorized by law."
[FN284] The disciplinary rules have long recognized exceptions to 
the general prohibition against contacts with represented persons such
as to determine if the person is in fact represented by counsel or
when counsel has been given prior notice of the communication and
consents.[FN285]

     Howen overlooked these exceptions to the general rule and, in
effect, terminated negotiations with Weaver.  It was apparent by
the Autumn of 1991 that Weaver was not cooperating with his
appointed counsel who nine months earlier had told Judge Ryan
that he was unsuccessful in contacting Weaver.[FN286]  Prior to this
time Hofmeister had continued to try to assist the marshals in
apprehending Weaver.  In July 1991, he met with them and Rodney
Willey, an associate of Weaver, in an effort to spur negotiations. 
On July 10, 1991, Hofmeister wrote Weaver and explained that the
firearms charge was relatively minor and that he thought Weaver had
a good defense to the charge.  Hofmeister added, "the 'cause' in
which you believe does not justify the damage you do to yourselves,
because the offense Randy is charged with is not much greater than
many traffic offenses.[FN287]

     Hofmeister reported to the marshals that soon after sending
this letter he received two letters from Vicki Weaver, in which she
state that they were resolute as it was "Yashua's plan" that they
live or die on the mountain.[FN288] Hofmeister also contacted 
Richard Butler, leader of a local Aryan Nations Church, and 
requested that Butler write a note to Randy Weaver asking Weaver 
to come down from the mountain and face the weapons charge.

                [G.J.]
     [FN289]

     Notwithstanding these efforts, Weaver still would not talk to
Hofmeister, and Hofmeister eventually refused to visit Weaver
unless he had an armed escort.[FN290]  Weaver even said that he 
would not surrender to Hofmeister because "[his] rights will be
violated."[FN291]  Despite these clear indications that Weaver did
not want Hofmeister's services, Howen adopted a rigid approach to
the issue and considered Hofmeister to be Weaver's counsel until he
was relieved by the court in September 1992 after Weaver's
surrender.  Furthermore, Howen never spoke with Hofmeister about
the matter or explored whether Hofmeister would consent to the
contact by the Marshals Service.[FN292]

     Howen was apparently unwilling to explore alternatives that
might have led to discussions with Weaver.  For instance, he could
have instructed the marshals to ask Hofmeister's permission to
communicate directly with Weaver.  This is not to say that
additional exchanges would have been fruitful.[FN293]  However, 
given the gravity of the situation, options that might have 
promoted a dialogue should not have been disregarded.  Howen was 
aware of the difficulties the Marshals Service faced in capturing 
Weaver, but, in the face of this evidence, her remained hostile 
to the negotiation option.  His rigid response to the Marshals 
Service's proposal was deceptively incomplete and effectively 
frustrated the Marshals Service's efforts.[FN294]

     Finally, Howen's statement that some of the surrender terms
proposed by Hunt and Evans were more appropriate for inclusion in
a plea agreement appears disingenuous.  There is no evidence that
Howen ever discussed devising such an agreement with Weaver's
attorney or with anyone else.  Indeed, the evidence is to the
contrary since Howen told this investigation that it was not his
practice to engage in plea bargaining.[FN295]

                (ii)  Other Actions

     In June 1991, U.S. Attorney Ellsworth discouraged Deputy
Director Stagg of the Marshals Services SOG from apprising Judge
Ryan of the considerable danger his team faced in arresting Weaver. 
In March 1992, Director Hudson asked Ellsworth to consider
dismissing the warrant against Weaver and reissuing it under seal. 
Hudson explained that the marshals thought an
assault on the Weaver residence would pose unacceptable risk of
injury to the Weaver children and Marshals Service personnel. 
Ellsworth and Howen refused to discuss the indictment, citing Judge
Ryan's call for the arrest of Weaver.  When Hudson offered to speak
to Judge Ryan, Ellsworth did not respond to the offer.  We are
troubled that the prosecutors so lightly dismissed the offer by the
Director of the Marshals Service to speak with Judge Ryan.  Indeed,
we question their judgment in rebuffing the Director's personal
effort to break the year-long impasse.  Neither Ellsworth nor Howen
advised Judge Ryan of the Marshals Service's concerns.  Such
inaction on their part was neither reasonable nor well considered
under the circumstances.

      d.  Impact of Delay Pending Hudson Confirmation

     The plan to apprehend Weaver was delayed for three months
pending the confirmation of Henry Hudson as the Marshals Service
Director.  The reconnaissance team expressed frustration over the
delay [FN296] because some believed the delay caused a gap in 
their surveillance intelligence.

     However, the pending confirmation did not appear to be the
only reason for the August reconnaissance mission.  Indeed,
Roderick and Cooper believed that additional surveillance was
necessary to find locations for "cover" teams for the undercover
operation.[FN297] The Executive Operational Plan also suggested that
surveillance was necessary to place cover teams, an essential
component of the undercover plan.  Furthermore, Hudson told this
inquiry that his approval of the undercover plan was "contingent on
the results of the latest surveillance," which was the August 1991
trip to the mountain.[FN298]

     Consequently, we conclude that the delay occasioned by
Hudson's confirmation did not cause the need for additional
surveillance but rather, at the most, altered the timing of
surveillance that would have been necessary to conduct in any
event.

 4. Conclusion

     The Marshals Service is required by statute to execute arrest
warrants.  Consequently, once a warrant was issued for Randy
Weaver's arrest, the Marshals Service had no choice but to
undertake efforts to apprehend Weaver.  Faced with Weaver's
repeated threats to violently resist arrest, the Marshals Service
explored many alternative plans designed to capture Weaver, but to
do so without harming Weaver, his family or the arresting officers. 
We believe that the Marshals Service acted properly and with due
caution in pursuing this purpose.  Moreover, we found no evidence
that the Marshals Service was pressured by outside entities or was
improperly motivated in its efforts.  We find, however, that the
court and the U.S. Attorney's Office did not appreciate the
difficulties facing the Marshals Service, and made no effort to
assist the Marshals Service in devising a peaceful solution to the
problem.

Weaver's surrender in August 1992.

     192 Id.  The Congress was scheduled for July 13, 1991 at
Hayden Lake, Idaho.  Byerly had information that Weaver's first
telephone call following his arrest on the weapons charge was to
Richard Butler of the Aryan Nations.

     193 In Summer 1992, Whittaker instructed his deputies to stay
away from the Weaver property out of concern for their safety.  FD-

     195 Stagg FD-302, at 4-5.  The SOG team discussed Evans'
proposal for a clandestine operation to arrest Weaver, in which
marshals would pose as prospective purchasers of real estate
adjacent to the Weaver property.  The SOG would arrest Weaver, if
he left the house to show the property.  Staff thought it would be
impossible for SOG to provide the necessary cover in mountainous
terrain.  Notes of SOG meeting on June 17 & 18, 1991; Stagg FD-302,
at 5.

     196 Stagg told Ellsworth that if SOG were forced to carry out
an assault and something went wrong, he would say that SOG's
actions "were at the insistence of [U.S. Attorney] Ellsworth's
office."  Stagg FD-302, at 5.

     198 USMS/SOG "Law Enforcement Operations Order," June 25,
1991, at 6.  The report recommended that no contact be made with
any local law enforcement prior to commencement of an operation to
apprehend Weaver.  No reason was given.  However, the marshals were
concerned about the "loyalties" of members of the Sheriff's
Department, though Sheriff Whittaker himself was not suspected. 
Hunt Sworn Statement, at 8.  Whittaker told this investigation that
he operated on a "need to know basis within his department with
respect to information received from the marshals about the Weaver
case.  Whittaker FD-302, at 3.

     212 Memo from Hunt to Evans, October 12, 1991, at 1; Report of
Investigation by Mays, October 12, 1991, at 3.

     213 Evans learned of this concern during a conversation with
Vicki Weaver's father, David Jordison.  Jordison told Evans that
during a visit with the Weavers in early April, "Randy and Vicki
voiced concern for becoming separated during the legal process and
expressed commitment to remain together no matter what the
Government did.  This commitment was expressed to include the
children."  Report of investigation by Evans, April 24, 1991, at 3;
Memo from Ronald Evans to Duke Smith, Tony Perez, John Haynes and
Lou Stagg, May 7, 1991, at 2.  In July 1991, Hofmeister sent a
letter to the Weavers assuring them that the children would not be
taken from Vicki, provided she did not use violence against anyone. 
Letter from Everett D. Hofmeister, to Mr. & Mrs. Randy Weaver, July
10, 1991, at 1.

     214 Memo from Hunt to Evans, October 12, 1991.  Jordison told
Evans that Randy and Vicki believed that Randy had "signed a bond
which would allow the Government to take his land and he therefore
was not going to leave his property."  Report of Investigation by
Evans, April 24, 1991, at 2.

     215 Magistrate Judge Ayers had explained to Weaver that he
would forfeit the property bond only if he failed to appear for
trial.  Arraignment Transcript, January 18, 1991, at 10-11. 
Weaver's attorney, Hofmeister, also explained to Weaver that the
bond would be forfeited only if Weaver failed to appear in court. 
Letter from Everett D. Hofmeister, Esq. to Mr. & Mrs. Randy Weaver,
July 10, 1991, at 1.

     216 Around this time, the marshals learned that Weaver
believed that the highest authority in Northern Idaho was the
county sheriff and that federal authorities had no jurisdiction
over him.  Report of Investigation by Mays, October 10, 1991, at 2

     221 "Feds Have Fugitive 'Under Our Nose'," Spokesman Review
(Spokane), March 1, 1992, at A1.  On the same day, an article in
the Chicago Tribune described Weaver as a "folk hero" holding the
Marshals Service at bay.  One week later, the story was picked up
by the Associated Press, and articles appeared in the New York
Times ("Marshals Know He's There But Leave Fugitive Alone," New
York Times, March 13, 1992, at A14) and the San Francisco Chronicle
("U.S. Slow to Nab White Supremacist," San Francisco Chronicle,

     233 Hufnagel Sworn Statement, at 2.  The "Executive
Operational Plan" (Phase I), said that Deputy Marshal Frank Norris
would conduct a medical survey for the operational plan.  Norris
told this investigation that it was common for a medic to go on an
operation in a remote mountain area.  However, Deputy Marshal Ron
Libby was sent on the mission instead of Norris.  Sworn Statement
of Frank Norris, at 2.

     234 The marshals also noticed a marine band radio antenna on
the Weaver cabin.  They brought in a radio monitor to determine
whether Weaver was communicating by short wave radio.  Report of
Investigation by Roderick, April 2, 1992; Roderick Sworn Statement
(draft), at 7-11.  The plan for Phase II contemplated jamming radio
communications from or to the Weaver cabin during the arrest. 
Executive Operational Plan (Phase II), April 10, 1992, at 2
(hereinafter cited as "Phase II Plan").  Terry Kinnison told the
Secret Service in 1985 that Weaver had military radio equipment and
possibly a police scanner.  See Kinnison FD-302, January 21, 1985
and February 5, 195.

     During Phase I, Roderick and the other marshals looked into
rumors that Weaver had worked for the Central Intelligence Agency
while in Vietnam as a member of the Special Forces.  They found
these rumors to be false.  Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 11.

     235 Roderick Trial Testimony, May 10, 1993, at 243-44;
Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 10.  Roderick thought that
foliage made it impossible for Harris to see them.  He also thought
it was possible that the flat tires may have been caused by
something in the road he struck earlier.  Id. at 10.

     236 Daily Report, April 10, 1992.

     237 The cameras, which operated on batteries, would provide

     242 During the first trip on April 27, 1992, the marshals
reached the lower garden area below the Weaver compound.  They had
to leave, however, when their night vision equipment failed. 
Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 12.  On the second trip on
April 22, Roderick and Libby located a spot of the west ridge close
enough to the compound to see and hear the Weavers talking with
Buster Kittel.  They also observed someone named Murphy bringing
the Weavers supplies.  Id. at 13; Report of Investigation by Hunt,

     245 Report of Investigation by Hunt, May 5, 1992; Hufnagel
Sworn Statement, at 5; Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 14-15. 
Roderick had feared that something like this might occur and had
warned Marshals Service Headquarters that they were sending the
surveillance team into the area too often.  Id.  The charred
remains of the camera equipment were found near the Weaver house
after Weaver surrendered to authorities on August 31.

     246 On April 14, a film crew told the marshals that they might
fly over the Weaver property.  Daily Report, April 14, 1992.  An
assistant to the producer of "Now It Can Be Told" said that a
helicopter flew over the cabin on April 18.  FD-302 Interview of
Richard Weiss, September 11 & 18, 1992, but said in an August 1992
interview that no shots had been fired.  However, a photographer in
the helicopter saw someone gesture at the helicopter and thought he
heard two shots on a boom microphone.  FD-302 Interview of Dave
Marlin, September 16, 1992.  Weaver denied that anyone had shot at
the helicopter.  "Fugitive: No Surrender," Coeur D'Alene Press, May

     255 Hunt had information that Weaver had contacts with law
enforcement officers.  Jurgensen, therefore, felt it necessary to
create a detailed history for his assumed persona, including a 
citation for a moving violation under his assumed name.  Sworn
statement of Mark Jurgensen, at 7.

     Roderick believed that a member of SOG should participate in
the undercover operation and, therefore, asked Deputy Marshal Larry
Cooper if he would be willing to take part in assessing the
undercover operation.  Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 18.  
Cooper had recently left the Special Operations Group, and he and
Roderick had known each other for many years.  Cooper Sworn
Statement, at 2-3.

     256 Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 18.  Hudson had
decided that the plan would not go forward until he had been
confirmed.  Hudson FD-302, at 4.  This decision does not appear to
have been based on operational concerns.

     257 Roderick reported that he was in Washington, D.C. with
Tony Perez and ran into the Director.  Hudson told Roderick "let's
go get 'em."  Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 18.  On August
13, 1992, Perez sent Duke Smith a handwritten note: "We're ready to
go as of Monday, August 17, 1992."

Statement, at 8-9.

     259 Hudson FD-302, at 3.  Roderick told this investigation "I
did not believe it was appropriate nor part of my job to pass
judgment on the merits of the [underlying] case."  Roderick Sworn
Statement (draft), at 5.  We find this assessment consistent with
the statutory duties assigned to the Marshal Service.  See 28
U.S.C.  566(a) ("It is the primary role and mission of the United
States Marshals Service to . . . obey, execute, and enforce all
orders of the United States District Courts . . . .") and  566(c)
("[T]he United States Marshals Service shall execute all lawful
writs, process and orders issued under the authority of the United
States . . . .").  Hudson and his subordinates asked Ellsworth and
Howen about the strength of the charges against Weaver and were
told that the case was good.  Hudson FD-302, at 3.

     260 Sheriff Bruce Whittaker seemed to prefer this option.  He
was quoted as saying, "It's just as bad for [Weaver] sitting up
there on that mountain as if he was sitting in prison somewhere. .
. . He's on his own self-imposed house-arrest up there, and it
isn't costing anybody any money." "Feds Have Fugitive 'Under Our
Nose'" Spokesman Review (Spokane), March 1, 1992, at A1.

     261 See Perez FD0392, at 5.  See also Note 315, infra.

     262 We note that the Idaho District referred the case to the
marshals, in part, because it did not have the financial 
resources or manpower to carry out the operation.  See Hunt Sworn
Statement, at 13.

     We have asked the FBI to determine how much the Marshals
Service spent on the Weaver case, but have not yet received the
calculation.

302, October 21, 1993, at 4.   As a result of the Kahl case, the
Marshals Service approached investigations of armed individuals
motivated by strong personal belief "in a much more methodical and
deliberate manner."  In such cases, "[n]othing could be taken for
granted," and the marshals would not go "charging in" to make an
arrest.  Perez FD-302, at 2.

to the cabin and abducting Vicki or Sara Weaver, while
they were in the "birthing shed" during their menstrual cycles.

     Ellsworth and Howen denied requests from the Special
Operations Group and Director Hudson to dismiss the Weaver
indictment for failure to appear, purportedly because Judge Ryan
wanted Weaver arrested.  Ellsworth and Howen also rebuked offers by
SOG and Hudson to meet with Judge Ryan to explain why they thought
it advisable to dismiss.  Judge Ryan told this investigation that
he was never contacted about this matter.  The only conversations
he had about Weaver were informal talks with Evans.  Ryan FD-302,

IV. SPECIFIC ISSUES INVESTIGATED

D. Marshals Service Activities Between August 17 and August 21, 1992

          1.  Introduction

     The defendants' attorneys alleged in pretrial motions that the
marshals went to the Weaver property on August 21, 1992 to engage
the Weavers and to force a violent confrontation.299]  Counsel
pointed to several facts, which, they alleged, proved that the
marshals intended "something quite in excess of a mere
'reconnaissance mission.'"  These alleged suspicious facts included
bringing a "suppressed" rifle on the mission and spending "several
hours sighting their guns" before the August 21 incident.[FN300] 
Counsel also suggested that the marshals initiated the exchange of
gunfire on August 21 and that they deliberately killed Sammy
Weaver.  Finally, there have been allegations that the marshals
exaggerated the amount of fire they received at the "Y," that they
tried to cover up the death of Sammy Weaver, and that they delayed
interviews with the FBI to enable them to coordinate their accounts
of the shootings.

          2.  Statement of Facts

               a.   Preparation for Surveillance

     In August 1992, Roderick and Hufnagel assembled the team which
would conduct the surveillance necessary before the undercover plan
could be placed in effect.  This surveillance team was comprised of
Roderick, Cooper, and Deputy Marshals Thomas, Norris, and Hunt.
[FN301] In addition, Duke Smith contacted SOG Commander John Haynes 
and requested that an SOG member participate in the surveillance
preceding the undercover operation.[FN302]  Haynes selected Bill 
Degan, Commander of the Northeast Task Force in Boston and a close 
friend of Roderick and Cooper, to be the SOG representative on the
team.[FN303] Haynes instructed Degan that the purpose of the mission
was simply to gather intelligence.[FN304]

     As detailed in the Executive Operational Plan, the objective
of the visit was to determine what cover was necessary for the
undercover operation and to update previous surveillance
information.  It was expected that the surveillance would take
approximately two weeks.[FN305]  There was no plan to arrest 
Weaver during these excursions.[FN306]

     On August 17, 1992, Degan, Cooper, Roderick, Norris, Thomas,
and Hunt arrived in Spokane, Washington.[FN307]  Thereafter, the 
team drove to Sandpoint, Idaho, to set up a command post at the
condominium on Schweitzer Mountain that Roderick's team had used in
April.  Roderick briefed the team on Wednesday evening, August 19. 
At that time, he repeated the standing orders from Marshals Service
Headquarters that they were to avoid contact with the Weavers,
particularly the children.[FN308] In preparation for their mission,
the marshals discussed the terrain, the people believed to be on
the mountain, and the weapons the Weavers were known to have.[FN309]
They also reviewed surveillance videos, photographs, and other 
information.[FN310]  Before the meeting ended, Degan inventoried 
each marshal's ammunition.[FN311]

     Roderick expressed concern that the longstanding feud between
the Weavers and the Raus might be building toward a confrontation.
[FN312]  Sheriff's deputies had told that Raus that they
would not go to the Weaver cabin out of fear for their own safety. 
[FN313] For this reason and others, the Raus were becoming 
increasingly frustrated, and there was concern that Wayne Rau's 
father might try to take the law into his own hands.[FN314]

     Roderick decided that the team would survey the Weaver
property on Friday, August 21.  Although he was still troubled
about returning to the area too many times, he thought that Cooper,
Degan, Norris and Thomas needed to become acquainted with the
property.  Of the group, only Roderick and Hunt had been to the
Weaver property previously.  The decision to conduct the
surveillance on Friday was based in part on information which
indicated favorable night illumination and weather conditions on
that day.[FN315]

     In preparation for the mission, the marshals had acquired
three .223 caliber M16 rifles from the Spokane office.  Roderick
believed that additional weapons were needed and mentioned the
shortage to Degan, who had access to additional weapons from a SOG
training display in Boston.  Roderick told Degan to bring some of
the rifles and other equipment with him.[FN316]  Thereafter, Degan
shipped a .223 caliber M16A2 Colt Carbine, a "sniper" rifle, a
shotgun, and a "suppressed" .9mm Nato Colt Carbine from a display
to Spokane.  In addition, the team members brought their personal
service weapons.[FN317]

               b.   Trip of August 21, 1992 to Weaver Property

     At approximately 2:30 a.m. on August 21, 1992, the team left
the condominium at Schweitzer Mountain in a van and a four wheel
drive Jeep and drove to the residence of Boundary County Sheriff
Bruce Whittaker where they left the van.  They then drove the Jeep
to the Rau residence where they arrived at approximately 4:30 a.m.
and parked the Jeep by the guest cabin.

     The plan was for the marshals to move under cover of darkness
to surveillance positions and then to leave after a few hours of
surveillance.  They did not intend to complete the day's mission
before day break.[FN318]  Each marshal was equipped with radios and 
night vision equipment and wore camouflage tops, pants,
and boots.  None wore bullet-proof vests, though they were 
available.[FN319] Degan carried one of the SOG M16s; Thomas and 
Norris each had rifles; Roderick had an M16; and Cooper had the
"suppressed" .9mm.[FN320]  Hunt was carrying camera equipment, so he
elected to take only his service weapon.  They did not bring the
sniper rifle Degan had shipped from Boston.[FN321]

     The marshals left their Jeep and walked up a trail which led
from the Rau house to an area known as the "Y".  At that location,
the group split into two three-man teams.  The first team, the
Observation Post ("OP") team, was comprised of Hunt, Thomas, and
Norris; the second team, the Reconnaissance ("Recon") team, was
comprised of Roderick, Cooper, and Degan.

     The OP team left the Y and took the left fork of the trail
through a canopy of trees and a fern field.  They then turned right
and proceeded up the hill to the north switchback road which led to
the observation post, which had been located during one of the
Phase II surveillance trips.  The observation post was
approximately 900 feet in elevation above, and one half to three
quarters of a mile from the Weaver compound, and was located at a
spot on the north ridge referred to as the "white pine 
tree."[FN322]

     While the OP team was on its way up the mountain, Roderick led
Degan and Cooper up the trail from the Y toward the Weaver
compound.  The team stopped at the edge of a cover of trees about
250 to 300 yards from the entrance to the Weaver driveway.  From
there.  Roderick pointed out the rock outcropping where the Weavers
responded to vehicles and other noises.[FN323]  Roderick wanted 
Degan and Cooper to see this area because the undercover marshal 
would have to drive there when approaching the Weaver compound.  
It was still dark when Cooper heard one of the dogs bark.[FN324]  
The Recon team returned to the Y as it was starting to become 
light.

     By now the OP team had reached the observation post.[FN325]  
The OP team was equipped with a spotting scope, a still camera and 
an 8mm video camera.  Once in position, the OP team was to watch the
Weaver compound while Roderick, Cooper, and Degan scouted the area. 
The two teams maintained contact by radio using fire crew code
words in case Weaver could intercept their transmissions.[FN326]

     Soon after its arrival, the OP team began to observe activity
in the compound.  They saw Sammy Weaver and Kevin Harris conduct a
security check around the house.  During the early morning hours
the dogs barked periodically which did not strike Hunt as
unusual.[FN327]  At one point, Hunt saw Randy Weaver come out of 
the house and yell at the dogs to "shut up."[FN328]  Hunt told
Thomas that the dogs' barking and the Weavers' response was normal
and that the activity in the compound appeared to be in accord with
previous surveillance.[FN329] The OP team reported these sightings to
Roderick, Cooper and Degan who stopped moving when there was
activity in the Weaver compound.[FN330]

     Thereafter, Roderick Cooper, and Degan went to join the other
marshals at the observation post.  However, they became lost and
had to radio Hunt for directions.  When the Recon team arrived at
the observation post at approximately 9:00 a.m., both teams
discussed their observations.  The OP team reported that members of
the Weaver family had run to the outcropping several times in
reaction to the dogs' barking.  On each occasion, the persons
running to the outcropping varied, but usually Harris and Sammy
Weaver were among them.  Norris stated that, using the spotting
scope, he had seen Harris with a long gun, Sammy with a side arm
and a long gun, Randy with a long gun, and Sara with a side arm in
a holster.[FN331]

     The Recon team stayed at the observation post briefly and
watched the Weaver family with binoculars and spotter scopes. 
They discussed different approaches to the property and the layout
of the compound, including the various outbuildings and their
possible purposes.

     Roderick wanted to show Cooper and Degan a spot he had
identified in April as a good location for a "counter-sniper" for
the undercover operation.[FN332] They found a position near a birch
stand on a large rock embedded in a hill some 200 to 250 yards from
the Weavers' cabin.[FN333]  Roderick and Cooper then left Degan and
crawled down to another rock approximately fifty yards below the
first rock.[FN334] This point lined up with the base of the Weaver 
driveway, approximately 100 to 150 yards away.  Roderick and 
Cooper observed family members take up positions at the rock 
outcropping whenever the dogs barked.[FN335]  They also
observed their movement back and forth between the outhouse, the
cabin, and other outbuildings.

     It was at this time that Roderick decided to toss some rocks
to see how the sound would carry and to see if the dogs would
react.[FN336] He asked the OP team to observe the results.[FN337]
Roderick then threw the first rock.  Roderick, Cooper, and Degan
did not hear the first rock hit, and the OP team reported that
there was no reaction from the people who were insider the cabin or
the dogs in the Weaver compound.  Roderick threw a second rock and
again no response occurred from the Weaver compound.[FN338]

     Approximately fifteen minutes later, Roderick and Cooper
rejoined Degan, and the three backtracked to the "switchback" road. 
They had spent roughly a half hour at the birch stand observation
point.  Roderick decided to show Cooper and Degan the garden/spring
house area below the house.  At that time, they were still looking
for places to station cover teams for the undercover operation.
[FN339] Cooper was concerned about being too close to the house in 
the daylight, but Roderick said that surveillance teams had been 
closer on prior missions without being detected.[FN340] Roderick 
also was hoping to limit their trips to the mountain to two 
instead of the planned four, so it was necessary to accomplish as 
much as possible during this outing.[FN341]  They agreed the 
previous night that  they would immediately leave the area if the 
dogs alerted.[FN342]

     Before proceeding to the garden/spring house area, Roderick
informed the OP team of his intention and asked that he be advised
of any movement in the compound as they were heading into the "hot"
area, which was the marshal's code for the land immediately
surrounding the Weaver compound.[FN343]  Thomas advised Roderick 
that "they had total containment," that is, the Weavers were in the
house.[FN344]

     After receiving this information, Roderick moved forward
slowly, followed by Cooper and Degan.  He indicated to Cooper and
Degan several possible cover team positions.  As they were
getting ready to leave the spring house area, Thomas radioed that
the Weavers were "responding" to an approaching vehicle.  None of
the other marshals heard a vehicle.[FN345] The dogs began to bark,
and people started to run out of the cabin.[FN346] Randy Weaver
exited first, followed by Kevin Harris, Sammy Weaver, Sara
Weaver, and Rachel Weaver.  Vicki Weaver remained in the compound
area.  Thomas told Roderick that they were carrying "equipment,"
meaning that they had firearms.[FN347]

     Roderick expected that the Weavers would assume their normal
defensive positions.  He Instructed Cooper and Degan to take
cover.[FN348] Roderick also took cover and radioed the observation
post for further information.[FN349] Hunt radioed Roderick and
informed him that this appeared to be "a typical vehicle
response" by the Weavers.[FN350] However, his assessment soon
changed.

     Rather than taking their normal defensive positions at the
outcropping, the Weavers jogged down the driveway.  Hunt warned
Roderick,  "You've got them all coming down the drive."[FN351]
Roderick then saw a large labrador retriever running toward his
position, followed by Kevin Harris, carrying a rifle.[FN352]

     Randy Weaver dictated this account of these events to his
daughter, Sara, on August 26, 1992:

Approximately 11:30 Friday morning . . . the dogs
started barking like they always do when strangers walk
up the driveway.  Randy, Kevin, and Sam ran out to the
rock with their weapons.  Randy was carrying a double
barrel 12 gauge shotgun.  Kevin was carrying a 30-06
bolt action rifle.  Sam was carrying a 223 mini 14. 
[FN353] When they got to the rock, our yellow dog 
Striker was down at the pumphouse barking up into the 
woods. Randy, Kevin and Sam went down to investigate. Sam
said he heard something, or someone running west, so
they followed.  Sam and Kevin followed Striker.  Randy 
dropped down on the old logging road headed west.

I (Randy Weaver) didn't have any idea what they
were chasing, but I was hoping it was a deer. [FN354]

     Kevin Harris claimed that, from the intensity of the dog's
reaction, he thought that there was "a large animal or a person"
in the vicinity.[FN355] Vicki Weaver wrote in her journal on 
August 21, 1992:

Randy, Kevin and Sam go down past the pump house
to see what's bothering the dog.  He apparently
made the servant of the New World Order retreat
down Farnworth Road.  They followed the dog part
way down.[FN356]

     Roderick told Cooper and Degan that a dog and a man with a
rifle were running toward them and that they had to move out.[FN357]
The OP team heard Roderick say, "Pull back!" and, "the dogs are
on us."[FN358] Roderick took the lead as the marshals fled through
the woods.  The area was thickly forested, and the marshals made
a great deal of noise as they ran.[FN359] As they fled down the
mountain, the marshals stopped several times to determine whether
they were being pursued and saw that they were.

     During the retreat, Roderick said that the dog might have to
be killed because it had picked up their scent.[FN360] Roderick
noted that each time he and the others turned to look, the dog
and Harris were closer to them.  As they ran through the woods,
Roderick continued asking the OP team who was coming and what
weapons they had.[FN361] The OP team radioed that "the assignment
fire chief," the code name assigned to Vicki Weaver, was walking
leisurely around the compound.[FN362]

     Hunt, Norris and Thomas remained at the observation post
above the Weaver property during the pursuit.  After Randy
Weaver, Sammy Weaver, Sara Weaver, and Harris ran down the drive,
Thomas observed Rachel Weaver hurry into the cabin and exit with
a "mini 14" rifle.[FN363]

     Roderick was still leading Cooper and Degan when they broke
from the woods into the fern field.  Roderick chose the fern
field because it provided the quickest retreat and allowed them
to move with the least noise.  At that time, he thought that they
could still escape.[FN364] They ran through the fern field and under
the tree canopy.  Roderick was farthest from Harris and the dog,
with Degan ten yards behind and Cooper another ten yards behind
Degan.  As Roderick turned to look back, he saw the dog, Harris,
and, for the first time in the pursuit, Sammy Weaver.[FN365]  
Cooper thought that he might have to shoot the dog
and stayed behind Roderick and Degan in case that became
necessary.[FN366]

     Cooper did not see Harris until after he was through the
fern field and into the canopy of trees leading to the Y.  He
told the others that it was "bullshit" for them to continue
running and that he did not want to "run down the trail and get
shot in the back."  He urged them to take up defensive
positions.[FN367] The others agreed.  Roderick cleared the canopy
first and entered the Y.  Degan arrived at the end of the canopy
and took a position behind a stump approximately three to four
feet off the right of the trail.[FN368]

          C.  Shooting at the Y

     There is a significant difference between the account of the
events at the Y given by the marshals and the account provided by
Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris.[FN369] All agree that Harris shot 
and killed Deputy Marshal Degan and that Deputy Marshal Roderick 
shot and killed the dog. Although the marshals did not realize until
several days later that Sammy Weaver had been shot during the
encounter, they agree now that he was wounded in the arm and
fatally shot in the back during the exchange of gunfire. 
However, the sequence of these events, and, in particular, the
timing of Sammy Weaver's death, remains contested, as does the
identity of the person who shot Sammy Weaver.  The events
comprising the shootout at the Y occurred very quickly, and  the
participants' perspectives often blended together and
occasionally were in conflict.  Thus, the following narrative
represents our best effort to present the most accurate
chronology of the events that occurred at the Y based on the
information provided to us during our investigation.

          (1) Account of Cooper and Roderick

     When Cooper reached the "water bar" at the entrance to the
Y, he saw Randy Weaver through the brush approximately 40 feet
away coming down the other trail from the Weaver compound.  They
looked at each other, and Cooper thought Weaver seemed shocked to
see him.  At the time, Cooper assumed that Roderick and Degan
were covering Weaver and he turned his attention to Harris and
the dog, which were still behind him.  He yelled at Harris, "Back
off, U.S. Marshals," believing that they had been set up for an
ambush.[FN370]

     The dog caught up to Cooper, and he held it at bay with his
gun.  The dog made a 360-degree turn around Cooper, growling and
snarling.[FN371] Cooper decided not to shoot the dog, fearing that
if he did so in plain view of Harris, it would precipitate a
gunfight, with both Cooper and Degan fully exposed.  After
circling Cooper, the dog ran past him and headed towards
Roderick.  Cooper left the trail and dove behind a rock located
about fifteen feet behind Degan and to his right.  Cooper did not
see Randy Weaver again.[FN372]

     Roderick, who was further into the Y, also saw Randy Weaver
on the trail leading up to the cabin.  Weaver was wearing a
camouflage jacket and screamed something unintelligible at
Roderick.  Roderick yelled, "Stop!  U.S. Marshal" at Weaver. 
Roderick could not tell if Weaver continued up the trail or went
into the woods.[FN373]

     Cooper radioed Degan to join him at the "fox hole," but
Degan did not respond.  He saw that Harris and Sammy were walking
directly in front of Degan.  Cooper observed Degan squatting on
the balls of his feet behind a stump and facing up the trail. 
Once Harris and Sammy were into the clearing of the Y, six to ten
feet past Degan's position, Cooper thought they had escaped
detection.  Unexpectedly, Degan went up on his left knee, with
his weapon on his shoulder and pointed at Harris and Sammy
Weaver, and said, "Stop! U.S. Marshal."  Cooper, almost
simultaneously joined Degan in saying "U.S. Marshal."  However,
before Cooper finished the command, Kevin Harris, who had his
back to Degan, wheeled around and fired at Degan with a 30.06
rifle.  Harris was holding the rifle waist-high when he 
fired.[FN374] Cooper saw Degan's arm go back as he started to 
fall.  Harris then began to bring his weapon to his shoulder as 
if he were going to fire again.  Cooper, realizing that Degan 
had been hit, fired a three-round burst at Harris with the 
"suppressed" .9mm.  According to Cooper, Harris dropped to the 
ground "like a sack of potatoes."  Cooper was convinced that 
he had hit Harris.  Cooper then wheeled his weapon toward Sammy.
He could not see whether Sammy had a gun because a tree blocked 
his view of Sammy's hands.  He did not shoot at  Sammy because 
Sammy had not fired at Degan and he did not see Sammy's weapon.  
Cooper did not think Degan had returned any fire.[FN375]

     Meanwhile, Roderick had moved south down the path.  He heard
a shot from his left, from the direction he had last seen Cooper,
Degan, Harris, and Sammy.  Roderick could not determine who had
fired the shot or whether it came from a .223 or 30.06 rifle,
although he thought it sounded like a heavy caliber weapon.[FN376]
Other than the dog, which was heading toward the path where Randy
Weaver had appeared moments earlier, Roderick could not see
anyone.  When the first shot was fired, the dog stopped and
turned its head back toward the marshals.  Concerned that the dog
would attack or lead Weaver, Harris, and the others toward the
marshals if they kept running, Roderick fired once at the dog
with his M16 rifle, striking the dog near the base of the
spine.[FN377]

     After he shot the dog, Roderick saw Sammy Weaver enter the Y
and run up the trail, away from Roderick and toward where Randy
Weaver had disappeared.  Sammy called Roderick, "a son of a
bitch" and shot two rounds at him from a mini-14 rifle.  Roderick
dove into the woods off the south side of the trail and took
cover behind a tree.  He received "constant" fire at that
position from weapons that sounded like a shotgun, a handgun, and
a rifle.[FN378]

     During this same period, Cooper heard two shots to his right
and Sammy Weaver yelling "You son of a bitch."  He then began
taking fire and heard Degan call "Coop, I need you."  Cooper told
Degan that he would be there "as soon as I can get 'em off our
ass."[FN379] Cooper rose and fired a second, three-round burst in
the direction from which he had last received fire in order to
provide cover fire for himself as he tried to get to Degan.[FN380]
Following these last shots, Cooper saw Sammy run out of view up
the trail to the cabin.  Cooper did not think that his shots had
hit Sammy Weaver.[FN381]

     When the fire shifted toward Roderick, it allowed Cooper to
move to Degan's position.[FN382]  Degan had been hit once in the
chest.[FN383] He was lying on his left side, his arm in the rifle
sling, making a gurgling noise.  He was conscious, but unable to
assist Cooper in moving to a protected position.  Within a few
moments, Degan lost consciousness and died.  Cooper took Degan's
weapon and changed the setting from semi-automatic to safety.  He
did not fire Degan's weapon.  Cooper returned to his position
behind the rock.[FN384] He radioed to Roderick that Degan had been
hit and needed help.

               (2)  The OP Team

     Norris, Thomas, and Hunt were at the observation post
overlooking the Weaver property, while Roderick, Cooper, and
Degan were being chased through the woods.  Norris heard the
announcement, "U.S. Marshal" and then a single shot.  Two quick
shots followed from, Norris believed, a .223 caliber weapon and
then he heard a series of discharges.[FN385]

     Thomas also heard a single shot, which he described as a
"heavy caliber."  Thomas contrasted the fist shot to subsequent
fire, which he characterized as "lighter."  Hunt told Thomas that
he also thought the first shot sounded like a heavy caliber
weapon.  Thomas glanced at his watch when he heard the first shot
and it was approximately 10:30 a.m.[FN386]

     Hunt could not determine the caliber of the weapon fired,
but said that the first shot sounded like a "long run."  Hunt
heard a single gunshot, followed by two gunshots, then four
gunshots.  He did not hear any shotgun blasts during the entire
incident.[FN387]

     Hunt, Norris and Thomas then left the observation post to
assist the other marshals.  They ran to the Y after hearing the
shots, they heard yelling from the Weaver property.  When Hunt,
Norris, and Thomas approached the fern field and turned left into
the tree canopy, they received a volley of gun fire from their
left side.  This gunfire, described as being from different
caliber weapons, went over their heads.  Hunt pointed his service
weapon in the direction of the fire, searching for a target to 
return the fire.  Seeing none, he did not fire.  It is not known
who fired at Hunt, Norris, and Thomas.[FN388]

                    (3)  Account of Weaver and Harris

Randy Weaver's account of the incident comes from a statement he
dictated to his daughter, Sara, on August 26, 1992:

When I reached the first fork in the logging road, a
very well camouflaged person yelled 'freeze RANDY,' and
I immediately said 'fuck you,' and retreated toward
home 80-100 feet.  I realized [sic] immediately [sic] that
we had run smack into a ZOG/NEW WORLD ORDER ambush.  I
stopped to see if I was being followed.

About that time I heard a gun shot and Striker [the
dog] yelped.  Then I heard two more shots and Striker
stopped yelping.  I started yelling for Sam and Kevin
to return home, and that they (THE FEDS) had shot
Striker.  I also fired my shotgun once into the air to
draw attention to myself praying that would help.  I
replaced the empty shell with a new one . . . jamming  
the shotgun.  I drew my .9mm handgun and fired 3-4
rounds up into the air and I yelled again for Sam to
return home.  Sam responded 'I'm coming DAD!'  I then
walked backwards up the hill toward home yelling to Sam
and Kevin to come home.  All the while I heard many
shots ringing out from the direction of the 
ambush.[FN389]

In the August 26 letter, Sara Weaver quotes Harris:

Me (Kevin Harris) and Sam followed Striker through the
woods until we came out on the road that forks off the
one Randy was on  . . .Striker reached the corner
first, then Sam, and then me.  A camouflaged [sic]
person was in the road and he shot Striker.  Sam yelled
'You shot Striker, you sonafabitch!'  And they pointed
a gun at Sam.  Sam opened [sic] fire.  I took cover
behind a stump and Sam headed up the road toward home. 
it appeared [sic] as though Sam had been wounded in the
right arm . . . . THE men were still shooting at Sam,
so I shot one of the sons of bitches.  After they
killed Sam one of the FEDs jumped out of the woods and
for the first time declared he was a federal marshal. 
The FEDs then grabbed their wounded and left.  I then
headed home up the road and spotted Sam's body laying
in the road without a doubt shot in the back.[FN390]

     In a statement to the FBI on September 1, 1992, Harris added
that he raised his rifle to fire when he fired at Degan, who
Harris said was approximately 20 feet away in the brush.  Harris
then heard Degan call out that he had been hit.  When Harris
fired, Sammy Weaver had already begun running up the trail. 
Harris claimed that after he fired the shots at Degan the
shooting came to a halt for a few seconds before he heard another
shot.  Sammy "yelped," then was silent.  Harris said he fired one
more shot in front of a camouflaged man who had reappeared out of
the brush "to scare him."  Harris stayed behind the stump
"approximately ten more minutes," when he heard "the sound of a
vehicle down the hill."  He then retreated to the Weaver house. 
Approximately 15 minutes later, Randy and Vicki Weaver, along
with Harris, retrieved the body of Sammy Weaver and placed it in
the birthing shed.[FN391]

     On the morning of August 21, Ruth Rau was outside her house,
loading laundry into her car.  At approximately 10:30 a.m., she
heard a series of gunshots in rapid succession, coming from the
direction of the Y.  Rau estimated that a total of 50 rounds were
fired, with the initial burst of gunfire lasting approximately
two minutes.  She heard additional gunshots at approximately
11:15 a.m.[FN392]

            d.  Events Following the Gunfire

     Roderick hearing Cooper's call for help, radioed the OP team
to send Norris, the medic, to the Y.  Roderick was unable to see
Cooper or Degan but assumed that they were on the trail above
him.  After requesting assistance, he dove back out onto the
trail in a prone position to assess the situation.  As he looked
for Cooper or Degan, he heard a rifle shot from his right front
side and then felt something pass across his stomach.  Roderick
heard more shots and ran back into the woods for cover, where he
received additional fire.  After examining himself, Roderick
discovered a bullet hole in his shirt but he was not injured.

     Shortly thereafter, Roderick heard movement off to his right
in the woods across the road.  Cooper told Roderick to toss
stones so that Cooper could determine where Roderick was and
direct him to Cooper's location.  Roderick moved through the
thicket toward Cooper and radioed their position to Hunt.  Both
men heard sporadic gunfire from the direction of the Weaver
compound and the fern field.[FN393]

     Meanwhile, Hunt, Norris and Thomas arrived at the Y.  As he
emerged from the canopy trail, Hunt had his handgun drawn while
Norris, the medic, placed his weapon on the ground and attempted
to resuscitate Degan.  Hunt picked up Norris' rifle laying on the
ground and looked across the trail up toward Weaver's cabin, but
saw no one.  Norris worked on Degan for a short time before
announcing that he was dead.[FN394] Cooper told Hunt and Norris
that Harris had shot Degan and that he believed that he had hit
Harris.[FN395] The marshals whispered because noise would bring
gunfire in response.[FN396] They fired no additional shots at 
the Y.

     Shortly thereafter, there was a tremendous discharge of
gunshots on the trail to the Weaver house, followed by the sound
of male and female voices wailing.  The marshals also heard
cursing; a woman shout, "Yahweh;" a man yell, "you son of a
bitch," and others scream, "You tried to kill my daddy."[FN397] 
At the time the marshals did not know that Sammy Weaver had been
shot in the confrontation.

     Roderick, Cooper, and Norris waited in the brush with
Degan's body while Hunt and Norris left for help.  Four to five
hours later, they heard an aircraft overhead and some gunfire.
[FN398] Whether conditions deteriorated as the day progressed, and 
it started to rain.[FN399] Cooper and Roderick, who decided not to 
leave without Degan's body, made several attempts to move Degan, 
but could not.[FN400] Roderick maintained radio contact with Hunt 
and told him that every time the marshals made a noise, the 
Weavers responded with heavy gunfire.[FN401]

       3.  Discussion
            
a.   Alleged Intent of the Marshals to Force
a Confrontation with the Weavers.

     This investigation has revealed no evidence that the
marshals went to the Weaver property on August 21, 1992 intending
to use deadly force against Randy Weaver or his family.  indeed,
the evidence indicates quite the contrary.  Months of planning
went into formulating the undercover plan,  and Director Hudson
had explicitly rejected any strategy that might harm Vicki Weaver
or her children.  We find absolutely no support for the
suggestion that Roderick deliberately ignored Hudson's direct
orders not to engage the Weavers.[FN402]

            (1)  The .9mm Weapon

     Defense counsel questioned the marshals' selection of
firearms, particularly the .9mm "suppressed" semi-automatic
weapon, and implied that the weapon was brought on the mission
expressly to shoot the Weaver dog.[FN403]

     At the outset, it should be noted that a "suppressed" weapon
is not silent.  The suppression mechanism reduces firing noise to
approximately one-fifth of the noise absent the mechanism.  If
the marshals had intended to fire a weapon without detection, the
Marshals Service had quieter guns available.[FN404]

     The five surviving marshals insist they had not planned to
use the .9mm, or any other weapon, to shoot the Weaver dog. 
Roderick testified that they marshals would have to neutralize
the dogs when it came time to arrest Weaver, but that they only
planned to conduct reconnaissance on the August mission.[FN405] 
Thomas understood that if they were confronted by the dogs, they
were to leave the area.[FN406] Cooper said that they did not 
intend to get close enough to the Weaver house to encounter 
the dogs.[FN407]

     The possibility of shooting the dog apparently first arose
as Roderick, Cooper, and Degan were running away from the dog and
Harris.  Roderick reports that, during the attempted escape, he
said that the dog might have to be killed because it had picked
up the marshals' scent.[FN408] Cooper also said that he decided
while they were running that it might be necessary to use the
suppressed .9mm to "take out" the dog because it was leading the
pursuers to the marshals and endangering their lives.[FN409]

     The .9mm was not used to shoot the dog.  Cooper stated that
he did not shoot the dog for fear that by doing so in plain view
of Harris, it would precipitate a firefight.[FN410] it was 
Roderick who shot the dog with his rifle, after hearing a shot 
fired to his left.

     Cooper and Roderick, who spent many years in the Special
Operations Group, saw nothing unusual about taking a "suppressed"
weapon on a surveillance mission.[FN411] We do not find the 
presence of the weapon suspicious and can envision circumstances 
in which this type of weapon would be important for a 
surveillance team, such as when dangerous animals could be 
encountered.[FN412]

     Although we recognize that the decision to bring the
"suppressed" weapon on the mission may seem unusual, we are
satisfied that there was no preconceived plan to use it or any
other weapon to shoot the Weavers or their dog.[FN413]

       (2)  "Zeroing" the Weapons

     It is common practice to "Zero" or readjust the sights of
weapons that have been shipped to ensure that they have not been
damaged in transit.[FN414] Chief Deputy Marshal Moriarity arranged
for the team to use a firing range to zero the weapons Degan had
shipped from Boston to Spokane to be used in the mission.  On
Thursday, August 20, Roderick, Cooper, Degan, Hunt, and
Moriarity, along with some local deputy sheriffs, drove to the
firing range and spent about an hour sighting and testing the
weapons.[FN415]

     Defense counsel pointed to the marshals' zeroing of their
weapons as evidence that they had planned to confront the
Weavers.[FN416] We found no evidence to support this allegation. 
The marshals' trip to the firing range was made openly, with
several local state and federal law enforcement officials
present.  Contrary to defense claims, it was not [SEALED BY
COURT]  for the marshals' benefit but rather was nothing more
than a precautionary practice in which the marshals routinely
engaged.  We do not attribute anything suspicious to this outing.

       (3)  Presence of a Medic on the Surveillance Team

     Defense counsel also alleged that Norris, the medic, was
brought on the August 21 mission [SEALED BY COURT]

                   [FN417]        Counsels' statement
implies the marshals planned a violent confrontation with the
Weavers that day.  We find no support for such a contention.

     Each prior trip to the Weaver property had medical
support.[FN418]  The Weaver cabin is on a remote, heavily wooded
mountain, and access to the area is difficult.  It is common for
a medic to go on an operation under such circumstances.[FN419]

     The marshals also could not ignore the fact that the Weavers
were constantly armed and were reportedly hostile to law
enforcement.  We consider the assignment of a medic to the team
to be a responsible precaution under the circumstances and not
proof that an assault was planned.

            (4)  Tossing of Rocks

     Defense counsel also alleged that Roderick threw rocks
[SEALED BY COURT] to taunt the Weaver dogs and to provoke a
confrontation.[FN420] Although Roderick did throw two rocks, we
cannot conclude that this was done for the reason counsel posits.

     The rocks at issue were thrown at least 15 minutes before
the dogs were alerted by the sound of a vehicle.  According to
Cooper he suggested to Roderick that they toss rocks "to see what
the dogs would respond to" because it was important to know which
sounds would draw a reaction from the dogs in case a "cover" team
member made a noise while moving into position.[FN421] Roderick was
not concerned that tossing the rocks would create an unwarranted
risk [FN422] since he had noticed during previous surveillance
missions that a variety of sounds emanated from the woods,
particularly along the side of the mountain.

     Roderick distinguished his intent to test for a reaction
from the dogs from purposely trying to provoke them.  He denied
attempting to excite the dogs.[FN423] Roderick was confident that,
if the Weavers had heard the rocks, they would not have been able
to see the marshals and that, if the dogs had reacted, they could
not have reached the marshals.[FN424]

     We do not believe that the marshals threw the rocks with the
intent to agitate the dogs or to draw them to the marshals'
location.  Although we accept as reasonable the marshals' desire
to determine how sound would carry in order to determine the best
position for the observation post, we do not believe that the
marshals fully considered the potential chain of events that
could have unfolded if the dogs had reacted to the rocks. 
Although this decision was not well considered, we found no
evidence that it was improperly motivated.[FN425]

            (5)  The Trip to the Lower Garden

     Though not specifically raised by the defense, this inquiry
considered whether the marshals went to the lower garden/spring
house area below the mount on which the Weaver cabin sits for the
purpose of luring the dog or the Weavers from the house.  We
found no evidence that the trip was made to incite a skirmish
with the Weavers.  Notwithstanding this conclusion, we must
question the wisdom of the marshals travelling that close to the
compound in daylight, especially after the dogs had been barking
much of the morning.[FN426]

            b.   The Initiation of Gunfire at the Y 

     The prosecution charged at trial that Harris fired at Degan
at the Y and set off the chain of events that led to the deaths
of Degan, Sammy Weaver, and the Weaver dog.  The defense
countered that it was the marshals, not Harris, who had initiated
the gunfire.  The jury acquitted Weaver and Harris of all charges
that they had assaulted federal officers.

     The marshals testified at trial and provided sworn
statements to this inquiry.  The Weavers and Kevin Harris did not
testify and declined to be interviewed for this investigation. 
Thus, their rendition of what occurred is derived from statements
made by or attributed to them following the shootings and their
surrender.

            (1)  Witness Accounts

     Cooper was the only witness who saw Harris shoot Degan.  He
testified that Harris fired first.  Harris admitted that he shot
Degan, but claimed that he did so after Roderick had shot the
dog.  It is not disputed that Harris was carrying a heavy caliber
30.06 rifle.

     Roderick could not see Harris fire and could not say whether
the first shot came from a .223 or 30.06 caliber weapon.  Thomas
and Hunt agree that the first shot sounded like a heavy caliber
weapon.  Harris and Randy Weaver were the only ones at or near
the Y with heavy caliber guns.  However, Norris thought that the
first shot, and the two that followed, came from a .223. 
Roderick and Degan were carrying .223 caliber M16 rifles.

     Thomas, Hunt, and Norris agree about the sequence of the
shots.  They heard one, then two shots, in quick succession,
followed by a barrage of fire.  Cooper said that Harris fired
once, and then Roderick twice.  Roderick said he heard one shot
before he fired once or perhaps twice.  The physical evidence
indicates Roderick fired only once.  Hunt, Norris, and Roderick
all stated that they heard Degan and Cooper start to identify
themselves just before the first shot.  Weaver and Harris gave
conflicting versions.  Weaver said that one of the marshals
called out for him to freeze before there was any gunfire. 
Harris said that the marshals did not identify themselves until
after the gunfire had stopped.

            (2)  Physical Evidence

     An inventory of the marshals' ammunition taken on the early
morning of August 22 showed that Hunt, Norris, and Thomas did not
fire their weapons during the incident.  Roderick fired one shot
from an M16 rifle.  Cooper fired six shots form the .9mm weapon.
Degan's weapon had been fired seven times.[FN427] This appears to
be inconsistent with Harris' claim that there was an "explosion
of gunfire" from the marshals.[FN428] We believe that the marshals
exercised restraint as to the number of shots discharged by the
Weavers and Harris.[FN429]

     Sammy Weaver was struck twice in the exchange of gunfire. 
One round hit him in the right arm, near the elbow, traveling
from front to back.  This bullet also shattered the stock of his
rifle.  The second and fatal shot hit the boy in the back and
passed through his body, exiting after a slight track from left
to right.[FN430]

            (3)  The First Shot

     We are presented with diametrically opposed descriptions of
events that occurred at the Y.  However, we are sensitive to the
fact that the gunfight occurred quickly and that all of the
participants were under extraordinary stress during and after the
shooting[FN431] which may have affected the witnesses' perception 
of events. The physical evidence is inconclusive and provides no
assistance in determining who initiated the gunfight, although it
is clear that the marshals did not "ambush" the Weavers.  Thus,
based upon the evidence available, we do not believe we can
definitively reconstruct the sequence of fire that occurred at
the Y.

            c.   The Shooting of Sammy Weaver

     Dr. Charles R. Lindholm, who performed the autopsy on Sammy
Weaver, could not offer an opinion on the type of bullet which
wounded Sammy's arm.  Dr. Lindholm reported that the fatal
back/chest wound was "indicative of a low velocity round."  he
did not believe that it was caused by a .223 caliber bullet and
thought that the wound "would be more consistent with that of a 9
millimeter round."[FN432]

     Dr. Martin L. Fackler testified at trial for the prosecution
as an expert in "wound ballistics."  Dr. Fackler concluded that
the fatal wound was caused by a .9mm bullet.[FN433] Dr. Fackler
believed the bullet that caused the fatal wound was similar to
the silver tipped bullets used in Cooper's weapon.[FN434]

     Two .9mm firearms were at or near the "Y":  Randy Weaver had
a .9mm pistol;  Cooper had been assigned a .9mm  "suppressed"
semi-automatic weapon.  Weaver claims to have fired his weapon
three or four times;[FN435] Cooper's was fired six times. Harris
reported that he heard the shot that killed Sammy.[FN436]

     Degan's M16 rifle fires a .223 caliber round.  None of the
marshals saw Degan discharge his weapon, though his gun was fired
seven times.  Cooper said that he did not fire Degan's weapon
after he retrieved it.[FN437] Dr. Fackler testified that Degan 
could have fired his weapon after he had been shot in the chest 
by Harris, although his accuracy would have been impaired.[FN438]
However, Fackler did not believe that Degan's M16 caused the
fatal injury, but thought it was possible that the weapon could
have caused the wound to Sammy's arm. [FN439]

     Cooper and Roderick last saw Sammy run out of view up the
trail.  The location where Harris found Sammy's body is unknown
because the Weavers moved the body.

     Although it is not our intention to speculate, the evidence,
though not conclusive, certainly suggests that the shot that
killed Sammy came from Cooper's .9mm weapon.  We have found no
evidence that Cooper, or any of the marshals, intentionally
sought to kill or injure Sammy Weaver.

     Cooper said that he purposely fired three shots at Harris,
after Harris shot Degan and appeared to be preparing to fire at
Degan again.  Cooper was convinced that he wounded or killed
Harris, who dropped to the ground "like a sack of potatoes."[FN440]
Actually, Cooper missed Harris, who disappeared out of view into
the woods along the trail.  Cooper then wheeled his weapon toward
Sammy and took aim, but did not fire.[FN441] Cooper next fired a
second three round burst, in the direction from which he had
received fire, as cover in an effort to reach Degan.  He said
this burst was not directed at a specific target.  It is possible
that Sammy may have been mortally wounded at that time.  

     Sammy Weaver was shot during a firefight in which he was a
participant.  There is no proof, and we do not conclude, that
Cooper intentionally aimed the fatal shot at Sammy Weaver. 
Indeed, the record demonstrates that the marshals went to great
lengths in preparing for their mission to avoid endangering the
Weaver children.

d.   Allegation the Marshals Attempted to
Cover Up the Shooting of Sammy Weaver

     The marshals maintain that they did not know that Sammy
Weaver had been killed until they were told about it on Sunday,
August 23.[FN442] Prior to that time the marshals did not believe
that Sammy Weaver had been harmed during the encounter.  Cooper
did not believe that he had hit Sammy when he put down cover fire
to get to Degan, because he saw Sammy running up the trail
afterward.[FN443] Indeed the only person that Cooper thought he had
injured was Kevin Harris who he thought he had seen fall "like a
sack of potatoes."

     According to Jurgensen, the news that Sammy's body had been
discovered in the "birthing" shed on August 22 appeared to
surprise the marshals.  Before this, the marshals had reported
that Sammy had been at the Y when the shooting began, but they
did not believe that he had been shot.[FN444] There was no mention
of Sammy when the Weavers retrieved his body from the 
trail.[FN445]

     In conclusion, we found no evidence that the marshals took
any actions to conceal the death of Sammy Weaver.  Indeed, the
evidence indicates that it was not until the FBI discovered the
body on August 24 that the marshals were even aware that Sammy
Weaver had been killed.

       4.   Conclusion

     We are unable to determine who initiated the gunfire at the
Y on August 21.  The evidence suggests, but does not establish,
that the shot that killed Sammy Weaver was fired by Deputy
Marshal Cooper.  Assuming that to be so, we find that there was
no intent on the part of Cooper or any of the other marshals to
harm Sammy Weaver.  We also find that the marshals did not
attempt to conceal the shooting of Sammy Weaver since they were
unaware that Sammy Weaver had even been injured.

September 1, 1992, that he was also carrying a .22 caliber
pistol.  Sam, in addition to the mini 14, had a .357 caliber
handgun.  FD-302 Interview of Kevin Harris, September 1, 1992.

     358 Hunt Sworn Statement, at 24;  Thomas Sworn Statement, at
8.  Hunt thought from the sound of the barking that the dogs were
moving westward.  He had not seen the dogs behave in this manner
before.  Hunt thought the dogs were barking "like they had the
'game treed'."  Hunt Sworn Statement, at 25.

testified that they were trying to escape at that point and were
no longer worried about making noise.  Cooper Trial Testimony,

     360 Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 24;  Norris Sworn

might be necessary to "take out" the dog.  He decided to use the
suppressed .9mm for that purpose.  Cooper Trial Testimony, April

     364 Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 25.  Roderick
testified that while they were running from Harris and the dog,
they could have stopped and taken up defensive positions several
times.  "{I}f we hunkered down low to the ground, they way we
were dressed, we probably could have taken them out" at several
points along their escape route.  They did not, though, because
they "were still under orders not to have a confrontation with
the Weaver family."  Roderick Trial Testimony, May 24, 1993, at

     369 The marshals gave statements to the FBI following the
shooting and testified in the preliminary hearing before the
grand jury and at trial.  They also gave statements to this
investigation.  The Weavers and Harris did not testify either
before or at trial, and declined to be interviewed for this
inquiry.  Their rendition of  what occurred is derived from
statements made by or attributed to them by others following the
shootings and their surrender.

that he thought Roderick had fired twice.  Roderick FD-302,
August 22 & 28, 1992, at 8.  Roderick also thought that he might
have fired two rounds.  Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 25. 
However, the physical evidence reveals that Roderick fired only
once.  FD-302 Interview of Mark Jurgensen, August 22, 1992, at 2.

     378 Roderick FD-302, August 22 & 28, 1992, at 8.  Roderick
said that the shooting sounded "like it was all around us.  There
was bark and other debris flying as bullets hit the ground around
me."  Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 26; Roderick Trial
Testimony, May 24, 1993, at 100.  The distance between where
Roderick jumped into the brush after shooting the dog and
Cooper's position was later measured as 39 feet.  Roderick FD-

     380 An FBI report quoted Cooper as suggesting that he held
his gun over his head and fired blindly.  Cooper FD-302, August

     388 Hunt thought that the shots had been fired from the
front and above him to his left.  Hunt was approximately 20 to 30
yards from the Y when they received the volley of gunfire.  Hunt
Sworn Statement, at 26.  Thomas and Norris were about 50 yards
behind him.  Thomas did a somersault to avoid the fire and kept
running.  Thomas Sworn Statement, at 9.  Hunt looked back at
Thomas and Norris, saw them on the ground, and thought that they
had been hit.  Hunt Sworn Statement, at 26.  Norris thought that
Sara or Rachel Weaver fired the shots.  The latter had been seen
leaving the house carrying weapons shortly before the OP team
started for the Y.  Norris Sworn Statement, at 10.

     389 Letter from Sara Weaver, August 26, 1992 (Appendix at
27).  Weaver told Bo Gritz in a monitored conversation that "Sam
opened up on the marshals when he saw 'em shoot the dog.  That's
when Kevin shot the officer.  Because they shot Sam."  Transcript
of Conversation between Randy Weaver and Bo Gritz, August 29,
1992.  In another conversation, recorded by the FBI, Randy Weaver
told Jackie Brown that Harris "saw Sam get hit in the right arm. 
And he, he just wanted to stop 'em from shootin' at him.  What
the hell would anybody do?"  Transcript of Conversation between
Randy Weaver, Bo Gritz, and Jackie Brown, August 29, 1992.

     Randy Weaver has also claimed that he went "down to the Y
and somebody jumped out in front of me, and yelled something.  I
headed back toward home, and I heard a shot, and I heard the dog
yelp."  Harris added, "Somebody shot the dog and, and it just,
all the woods exploded with gunfire."  Transcript of Interview of
Weaver by Tom Brokaw, August 18, 1993, for "Now," NBC News.

had shot Harris then.  He did, however, receive a radio
transmission from Cooper saying this about an hour after Thomas
reached the Rau house.  Thomas Trial Testimony, June 2, 1993, at

     396 Hunt Sworn Statement, at 27; Roderick Trial Testimony,
May 24, 1993, at 122 ("[E}very time the Weavers heard a sound
they just unloaded, they would start firing at any noise they
heard").

     397 The most likely explanation for the uproar is that the
Weavers had discovered Sammy Weaver's body.  However, there was
no mention of Sammy Weaver's name during the commotion.  Cooper
Sworn Statement, at 11; Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 27;
Hunt Sworn Statement, at 28.  The marshals could not see anyone
from their position.  Roderick and Cooper assumed that the uproar
meant that Harris had died from wounds received during the
exchange of fire.  Cooper Trial Testimony, April 25, 1993, at
170, April 16, 1993, at 527;  Cooper Sworn Statement, at 11;

     398 Roderick testified that he heard the plane about two
hours after Thomas and Hunt had left.  Roderick Trial Testimony,
May 24, 1993, at 125.  See Norris Trial Testimony, June 2, 1993,
at 75.  Roderick told Hunt to instruct the Federal Aviation
Administration to restrict airspace around the mountain.

     399 Cooper characterized conditions as "miserable."  Cooper

at 11.  The Crisis log says that Hunt reported at 5:08 p.m/. that
it had started to rain.

     400 Cooper and Roderick refused a suggestion from the Crisis
Center that they leave Degan and "get out of there."  Hunt Sworn
Statement, at 31-32.

     401 Roderick gave Hunt various orders as Hunt and Thomas
worked their way down the mountain, such as to reestablish the
observation post, block off the road, and obtain night vision
equipment.  Hunt relayed Roderick's instructions, but they were
not followed.  Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 27-28; 
Cooper Sworn Statement, at 11.

     402 Roderick specifically instructed surveillance team
members on the evening of August 19 to avoid any encounter with
the Weavers, particularly the children.  Hunt Sworn Statement, at
20;  Cooper Sworn Statement, at 5; Norris FD-302, August 23 & 29,
1992, at 1.  Roderick characterized himself as having been
"brainwashed" about ensuring that "the children were . . .
completely removed from the equation."  Roderick Sworn Statement
(draft), at 20.  Thomas told us that the team had been instructed
"to hide (from the children) and avoid them."  Thomas Sworn
Statement, at 4.

     405 Roderick considered a number of means of controlling the
dogs when the time came to arrest Weaver.  Deadly force and
various chemical products were among the options.  however,
Roderick did not finalize a plan because the operation never
reached the point when arrest was imminent.  Roderick Trial
Testimony, May 20, 1993, at 149-52, 154.

     407 Cooper had been involved in 1991 in a SOG operation in
California where three SOG members and three National Guardsmen
hiked several miles through dense woods to arrest a fugitive.  on
that project, Cooper was prepared to shoot the fugitive's dog if
the dog and the fugitive was captured without incident.  Cooper

dog.  Thomas Sworn Statement, at 8;  Hunt Sworn Statement, at 25.

firearms may be used against animals "to prevent attack that
threatens bodily injury."  See Memo by Stanley E. Morris,
(former) Director, U.S. Marshals Service, June 10, 1988, at 2.

     413 We are troubled by the fact that there was no plan to
deal with the dogs during the surveillance mission.  The animals
were known to be active and excitable, and there had been reports
that one of the dogs, Striker, was aggressive and had attacked
someone.  Cooper Sworn Statement, at 5.  The potential for an
encounter certainly existed and ought to have been more
thoroughly considered.

     425 We are again unsettled by the absence of a plan for the
possibility that the dogs would locate the marshals' position. 
This omission is symptomatic of a larger problem, the lack of a
plan to follow should the Weavers discover the marshals.  For
instance, all three marshals abandoned the observation post once
the shooting began at the Y.  Although their desire to go to the
aid of their colleagues is understandable, the law enforcement
components that responded to the mountain were deprived of vital
information on the Weavers' location and movements in the hours
that followed the shooting.

     426 Again, there was no contingency plan to keep someone at
the observation post, should the Weavers pursue the
reconnaissance team.  The marshals who remained on the mountain
with Degan's body following the shootout asked Hunt to place
someone in the observation post to observe the Weavers.  Cooper
Sworn Statement, at 11.  This was not done.

     427 Roderick's weapon had been loaded with 27 rounds, as had
Degan's.  Cooper's 9mm had been loaded with 25 rounds.  Jurgensen

as lasting two minutes.  See Ruth Rau FD-302, October 12 & 13,

IV. SPECIFIC ISSUES INVESTIGATED

E.   Activation of FBI hostage Rescue Team and SWAT Teams on
August 21, 1992 and Initial Intelligence Gathering.

          1.   Introduction

     Soon after the U.S. Marshals Service Headquarters learned of
the shooting at Ruby Ridge it contacted FBI Headquarters
officials.  A decision was made to deploy the FBI Hostage Rescue
Team ("HRT") to Ruby Ridge.  Allegations have been made that the
deployment of the HRT on August 21 was based on false information
about the dangerousness of Randy Weaver, the situation at Ruby
Ridge and the August 21 exchange of gunfire.  In addition, it has
been contended that the activation of the HRT and regional FBI
Swat Teams was an improper, unnecessary, and exaggerated response
to the situation.  Specifically, critics have suggested that
local law enforcement agents, who rescued the marshals, should
have been left to resolve the situation and that the U.S.
Marshals Service should have remained in charge.  There has also
been a claim that the federal response was driven by an
influential Department of Justice official who had been a close
friend of Deputy U.S. Marshal Degan and the Degan family.

     Critics have also charged that the FBI failed to assess the
situation accurately after the August 21 shooting in large part
because they failed to carefully gather and verify information on
the background of the Weaver/Harris group and the events that
transpired at the Y.  The faulty information gathering techniques
of the FBI is alleged to have contributed to the subsequent shots
fired on August 22, 1992.

     2.   Statement of Facts

          a.   The Marshals' Report of the Shooting

     Following the shooting at the Y, Deputy Marshal David Hunt,
who was familiar with the terrain of the mountain, and Deputy
Marshal Joseph Thomas left, at approximately 10:45 a.m. to get
aid.  They headed through the woods to the Rau house [FN446] where
they arrived approximately 40 minutes later.

     Hunt immediately placed a "911" call for assistance which
was received by the Boundary County Sheriff's Office, Bonners
Ferry, Idaho, at 11:20 a.m.  Hunt told the dispatcher:

I have an emergency situation on my hands . . . .
I got one officer dead.  I got (inaudible)
pinned down.  I need help quick . . . .  I want
the State Police, I want all the help that I can get.
I gotta go back in for more officers that are
trapped. [FN447]

     Next, Hunt called Marshals Service Headquarters in
Washington, DC  and told Tony Perez, Chief of Enforcement
Operations, that before the shooting began, a dog had picked up
the marshals' scent and that they had run to avoid the Weavers.
Hunt spoke of a "heck of a gunfight," in which Harris killed
Degan.  Hunt told Perez that he had not heard any gunfire since
leaving the mountain. [FN448]

     Shortly thereafter, Hunt told Chief Deputy Ron Narvarro of
the Boundary County Sheriff's Office that the marshals were still
on the hill and that they required assistance.  Hunt did not say
that the marshals were "pinned down." [FN449]

     The Marshals Service Crisis Center ("Crisis Center") was
activated under the direction of Duke Smith, Deputy Director of
Operations, and the Special Operations Group ("SOG") was alerted
to deploy. [FN450] Hunt was transferred to an open line in the
Crisis Center, on which he explained:

Initial reports indicate that the USMS surveillance team
came under fire from occupants of the Weaver compound and
are still pinned down in defensive positions. [FN451]

(Emphasis added.)

     Twenty five minutes later, at 12:05 p.m., Hunt reported to
the Crisis Center:

Local sheriff has SWAT team on the way to the scene, which
[sic] is no longer taking fire . . . .  Team [of marshals]
was trying to pull out when Weaver's dog alerted, team drew
multiple volleys of fire from the house.  Degan was struck
in the chest.  Return fire killed on e of Weaver's dogs.
The rest of the team is still located on the mountain, but
not under fire, unable to withdraw without exposing        
themselves to hostile fire. [FN452]

(Emphasis added.)

     FBI Special Agent Donald Glasser was detailed to the Crisis
Center.  Perez briefed Glasser at approximately 1:00 p.m. and
used the term "pinned down" to describe the marshals' state, but
did not say that the marshals were "receiving fire." [FN453]

     By this time, agents from the U.S. Border Patrol, the
Boundary County Sheriff's Office, and the Idaho State Police had
reached the scene.  The Idaho State Police Critical Response Team
("CRI") and the Marshals Service SOG unit were en route. [FN454]
Various law enforcement officers ran sirens to "send a message to
the mountain that they were there." [FN455]

     In the afternoon, Hunt spoke to Mays in the Marshals Service
Office in Boise.  Mays asked for an account of the events so that
he could prepare court papers, if needed.  Hunt started to tell
Mays about the events of August 21 when Marshal Johnson took the
phone.  Later Johnson repeated to Mays what Hunt had told him.
Mays used this information to prepare an affidavit in support of
a warrant to search the Weaver cabin and property. [FN456]

     At some point, Cooper told Hunt that he may have shot
Harris.  this information was passed to the Crisis Center.[FN457]
Hunt briefed many of the law enforcement officers on the scene,
giving a detailed listing of the weapons each member of the
Weaver family was known to carry.  He told them he did not
believe that there were booby traps on the property.[FN458]

     John Twomey, Deputy Director of Administration, informed
Director Hudson of the shooting, while the latter was en route to
North Carolina.  Twomey reported that, according to Hunt, the
Weaver dogs had been "spooked" by the marshals, Harris had killed
Degan, and the marshals were pinned down.  Twomey added that Hunt
assumed that the marshals were still receiving gunfire. [FN459]
Hudson instructed Twomey to notify Douglas Gow, FBI Associate
Deputy Director of Investigations, at FBI Headquarters, of the
incident.

                    b.  Decision to Deploy the HRT

     The FBI's involvement in the Idaho crisis began when U.S.
Marshals Service Director Henry Hudson told FBI Associate Deputy
Director W. Douglas Gow that a Deputy U.S. Marshal had been shot
and killed in Northern Idaho;  That two other deputy marshals
remained pinned down, having previously received heavy gunfire
from several subjects; and that the Department of Justice had
instructed that the FBI would be the lead agency handling the
situation.  Director Hudson and Gow scheduled a meeting for 4:30
p.m. EDT to discuss the situation. [FN460]

     Before the meeting with the Marshals Service, FBI Assistant
Director Larry Potts told FBI Violent Crimes and Major Offenders
Section Chief E. Michael Kahoe to learn as much as he could about
the incident.  thereafter, Kahoe called Special Agent in Charge
Eugene F. Glenn of the FBI's Salt Lake City Division at
approximately 5:30 p.m. EDT (3:30 p.m. MDT).  He told Glenn that
a deputy marshal had been shot and killed during a firefight in
Northern Idaho, that Gow had been called by the Marshals Service
Headquarters and that FBI assistance had been requested.  Kahoe
said Hudson was en route to FBI headquarters to provide
additional details to senior Bureau managers. [FN461]

     Glenn realized that there would be few resources in Northern
Idaho and initiated a series of actions to prepare for a probable
FBI response.  he instructed Special Agent George J. Calley at
the Boise FBI Office to obtain additional details of the
incident.  Calley subsequently reported that he had learned from
U.S. Marshal Michael Johnson that, during a fugitive
investigation, one deputy marshal had been killed, another had
been wounded, and additional marshals were pinned down near the
site of the original gunfire.  In addition, Calley learned that
the primary subject in this matter was Randy Weaver and that the
current priority of the Marshals Service was to rescue the
marshals on the hill. [FN462]

     Glenn relayed this information to Kahoe and over the next
several hours, it was agreed that he would begin an FBI SWAT Team
call-up in the Salt Lake Division and would prepare for
deployment to Northern Idaho.  Glenn also agreed with FBI
Headquarters to deploy the Portland and Seattle SWAT teams and
accepted management assistance from Special Agent in Charge
William D. Gore, Seattle Division. [FN463]

     When Gow received word of the assault, he called Assistant
Special Agent in Charge Richard Rogers, Commander of the FBI
Hostage Rescue Team ("HRT").  The HRT is a specialized full-time
tactical team, based at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia.
Although its original purpose was to handle high-risk terrorist,
hostage situations, its mission has evolved to cover a variety of
sensitive, high-risk situations.[FN464]  At 4:30 p.m. EDT, Gow told
Rogers that a deputy marshal had been shot and killed in Northern
Idaho, that other deputy marshals were still pinned down there,
and that the Marshals Service had requested assistance.  As a
result, the HRT was put on alert. [FN465]

     Gow, Potts, and Deputy Assistant Director Danny O. Coulson
met with Hudson and Marshals Service officials John Twomey and
Herb Rutherford.  Hudson described the situation and requested
FBI assistance.  He conveyed an urgency in the request,
explaining that:  "one DUSM had been shot, two DUSMs were 'pinned
down,' a third DUSM was relaying information.  The concern at the
time was to get these deputies out of 'harms way' before
additional casualties were incurred." [FN466]  Hudson and the others
reported that a team of marshals had been attempting to perform
reconnaissance in preparation for serving an arrest warrant on
Randy Weaver.  They asserted that:

[O]ne of the DUSMs had been attacked by a dog, and had shot
the dog, which started a firefight.  During the firefight,
one DUSM had been killed and his body and the remaining
surviving DUSMs had been able to escape and get to a
telephone, the remaining DUSMs were in only sporadic radio
contact, and their exact location was not known.  The
reported heavy fire had been directed at the DUSMs from
numerous locations . . . the team of DUSMs had not intended
a confrontation with the subjects, and had attempted to flee
when confronted by the dog and subjects, but had been chased
by the subjects, before the shooting death of the DUSM
occurred. [FN467]

     During this meeting, the FBI representatives were shown an
aerial photograph of the Weaver cabin and the surrounding area
and were told that Weaver and his associates would leave their


[Editor's Note: Page 135 in the text is unavailable, which
includes footnotes 468 to 472.]


cabin.  It was believed that Weaver knew well the extremely
rugged terrain near his cabin.  He had told the media that he
would not be captured alive and that the only way he would leave
his cabin would be to die in a shoot-out.  His entire family,
including his wife and children, was reported to be heavily
armed. [FN473]

     Following the meeting, Gow briefed the FBI Director William
Sessions and called the Deputy Attorney Generals office in the
Department of Justice.  Although Gow acknowledged that Degan was
a "high profile individual within the USMS", Gow stated there was
no pressure on the FBI to activate the HRT by friends of Degan.
[FN474] Robert Mueller, then Assistant Attorney General for the
Criminal Division, was a professional acquaintance of Deputy
Marshal Degan's as they had both worked in Boston while Mueller
was in the U.S. Attorney's Office.  Mueller, however was not even
in town during the first days of the crisis.  Gow thought that
Potts may have also known Degan in Boston.

     HRT deployments must be initiated by the Assistant Director
of the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division ("CID").  After
consulting with FBI Deputy Assistant Director Coulson, Potts
decided to deploy the HRT fully.  He had no conversation with
anyone outside the FBI regarding this decision and was not
pressured to deploy the HRT.  Potts acknowledged, however, that
he consulted with Coulson whom he considers the most
knowledgeable tactical operations manager in the Bureau.  They
concluded that this would be an "extremely high-risk operation,
possibly the highest risk situation [they] could encounter,"
given the information about Weaver's Special Forces background;
his knowledge of explosives; the fact his children were trained
with weapons; and his possible Aryan Nations affiliation.  It was
their understanding that:

One law enforcement officer had already been killed, and
others remained "pinned down," unable to be extricated.  The
attack on the retreating DUSMs had been extremely aggressive
in nature, with a "barrage of gunfire" having been directed
at them.  The situation was so sever that these USMs, who  
were specially trained, were afraid to move.  They were
located in a remote area of rugged terrain, which was well
known to the subjects.  The family of Randy Weaver was
armed, including his children.  It was unknown whether the
surviving DUSM's were still receiving fire and it was not
known whether the subjects had reinforcements, were
in the Weaver cabin, in the woods near the cabin, or whether
they had escaped.  Because of Randy Weaver's military
background, it was believed that the subjects may have built
tunnels and bunkers, making any approach to the area
exceedingly dangerous. [FN475]

     Rogers was notified of the decision to deploy and
immediately departed aboard an FBI aircraft.  The Strategic
Information and Operations Center ("SIOC") at FBI Headquarters
was activated and other routine investigative steps were
instituted.  The Special Operations and Research Unit ("SOARS")
in Quantico was notified to provide negotiators.

     Neither Potts nor Coulson had any discussions with persons
from the Department of Justice, outside the FBI or the United
States Marshals Service, regarding their decision to activate the
HRT until after the decision had been made.  That evening Gow
discussed the trouble the FBI was having in getting HRT
transportation to the crisis site with Attorney General Barr, who
appeared to know about the situation.  They discussed the "red
tape" preventing the transportation of the main body of the HRT
to Idaho. [FN476]

c.   Initial Intelligence Gathering and
Rescue of the Marshals

     HRT commander Rogers departed for Idaho at approximately
6:30 p.m. EDT on August 21 with an advance team of HRT personnel,
including Supervisory Special Agent Stephen McGavin, and Special
Agents Lester B. Hazen and Dale F. Carnegie, accompanied by
Marshals Service Deputy Director Duke Smith.

     Potts had instructed Rogers to advise Coulson immediately
after an on-site assessment had been made.  Potts knew that the
Idaho State Police SWAT Team was on the scene, but Potts would
not authorize them to rescue the surviving marshals until an FBI
on scene evaluation of the mission had been made.  The Marshals
Service had not been authorized to conduct tactical operations
and, as far as Potts knew, they were involved only in perimeter
assignments given by the FBI.  When the first FBI personnel
arrived at the crisis site, Potts was advised that no shots had
been fired for some time and that communications with the
surviving marshals would make it possible to locate them.

     Captain David Neal, Commander of the Idaho State Police CRT,
was informed of the incident and proceeded to the command post at
the RAU meadow.  After a briefing from Hunt, Neal decided that
the CRT would wait until nightfall to rescue the marshals so as
to avoid ambush by the Weavers. [FN477]

     A ten man CRT team, along with Deputy Marshal Thomas, left
the command post at approximately 8:30 p.m. PDT (11:30 p.m. EDT).
[FN478]  The night was "pitch," and only two member of the team had
night vision equipment.  The others made their way by placing
their hands on the person in front of them and forming a
chain.[FN479]  They proceeded slowly and with extreme caution for
fear of being ambushed or encountering booby traps.  At 11:21
p.m. PDT, the team reached the marshals at the Y.  When Captain
Neal arrived at the Y he was concerned about the security of the
CRT team and asked Roderick for an update.  The first thing
Roderick told Neal was, "I shot the dog." [FN480]

     The CRT team secured Degan's body and headed down the
mountain.  The return was long and difficult due to the extreme
darkness and the burden of Degan's body.  They returned to the
Command Post and 12:46 a.m. PDT.

     Earlier that day, Marshal Jurgensen had been dispatched to
Idaho to render assistance.  When the marshals were rescued, he
accompanied the five marshals to a hospital at Bonners Ferry,
Idaho. [FN481]  The marshals kept their weapons because of reports
that Weaver supporters were on their way to the hospital. [FN482]
They were examined briefly at the hospital and then released.
Thereafter, Jurgensen drove the marshals to the condominium at
Schwaitzer Mountain, where they arrived at approximately 3:00
a.m.  By this time, Roderick, Cooper, Thomas, Norris and Hunt had
been awake nearly 24 hours.  After awhile, they went to sleep.
[FN483]

     Jurgenson collected the marshals' weapons and counted the
ammunition.  From this inspection, he determined that Hunt,
Norris, and Thomas had not fired any shots; Roderick had fired
one shot from his M16 rifle; Cooper had fired six shots from the
.9mm; and seven shots had been fired from Degan's weapon. [FN484]

     Meanwhile, while en route to Idaho, Smith briefed Rogers and
the other HRT personnel on the Weaver case.  Rogers had seen a
photograph of the crisis area, which Smith described as an
isolated area of extremely rugged terrain.  According to Rogers,
Smith provided the following background on the family:

[G.J.]

     Rogers also testified at trial about the impression of the
crisis that Smith conveyed:

Smith said the aggression was on the part of the members of
the Weaver family and that Degan . . . and the others were
actually pursued while attempting to retreat from Randall
Weaver and Kevin Harris and after being observed by those
subjects. . . . He told me that the family was heavily
armed, they had both pistols and rifles.  There was an
indication that they might possibly . . .  have some armor-
piercing ammunition.  It was unclear as to whether there
were grenades or explosives, because of Mr. Weaver's
background in the military . . . . I certainly had the
impression that this was a heavily armed group, and based on
what he had told me concerning the fire-fight breaking out
and Marshal Degan dying, it was clear to me that they were
willing to use these weapons. [FN486]

     Smith related Weaver's threats that a standoff would only
end in his death, and explained that the Weaver family had
threatened other law enforcement officials on numerous occasions.
In response to letters about the pending charges, he stated that
the Weavers asserted that Randy was not coming down willingly.
Both Randy and Vicki Weaver had commented at an initial
appearance that any attempts to arrest them would result in the
deaths of law enforcement officers.  Randy Weaver had told a
local reporter that he would not come off the mountain.  The
Weavers sent letters to both state and federal court officials
regarding Randy Weaver's unwillingness to face charges.  Smith
also reported that Weaver had been a Green Beret and had
expertise in the manufacture of explosives and booby traps.  He
described the Weaver compound as a mountain stronghold,
inaccessible except by a single extremely rough road, and
protected by fighting positions.  Smith reported that TV show
host Geraldo Rivera had unsuccessfully attempted to interview
Weaver and that there were unconfirmed reports that Weaver had
fired at Rivera's helicopter. [FN487]

[G.J.]

[G.J.]

     Rogers said that it was his impression that a firefight was
either "still in progress" or there was "intermittent gunfire
taking place" or "sporadic gunfire . . . through the evening".
He believed that the marshals were still on the mountain and that
they could not extract Degan's body. [FN489]  Rogers considered the
subjects to be potentially still in an offensive, aggressive
mode, and he concluded that the situation was dangerous with the
potential for additional violence. [FN490]

     Potts and Coulson relayed to Glenn the information about the
crisis situation that the Marshals Service had provided.  Prior
to Glenn's arrival Hunt had briefed two FBI agents who had
responded to the call for assistance.  He gave them information
on the Weaver family and Kevin Harris, an overview of the
morning's events, and a description of Weaver's tactical
operations and defensive positions.  Hunt told them that Weaver
and the others had pulled back to their defensive positions and
were preparing for and awaiting the arrival of government agents.
Hunt also briefed local law enforcement officials. [FN491]

     These were the only times that Hunt was asked for
information, with one exception.  Late in the evening of August
21, Hunt was summoned to the command post and asked for the best
position for sniper/observers.  Hunt identified the high ground
overlooking the Weaver compound and located it on a map.  He was
surprised that he was not asked additional questions.  The FBI
did not inquire about the intelligence he had collected during
the early hours of the response.  However, Idaho State Police and
others retrieved his case files, including surveillance photos
and topographic maps, from the Marshals Service command post.
Hunt was frustrated that his files were disassembled and
distributed without his consent.

     When Special Agent in Charge Eugene Glenn arrived in
Sandpoint, Idaho, about 7:00 p.m.(PDT), deputies from the
Boundary County Sheriff's Office took him and members of the Salt
Lake SWAT Team and Technical Agents to a National Guard Armory to
be briefed by law enforcement personnel.  Deputy Sheriff Lonnie
Ekstrom told Glenn that Randy Weaver was a violent, former Green
Beret and explosives expert, who reportedly had a large cache of
arms concealed on his property.  Because of Weaver's political
and religious beliefs, he had separated himself from the
community and was living off the land.  Weaver was said to have
constructed bunkers and fortifications around his home and
claimed he wanted to have a show down or last stand with the
federal government.  Ekstrom told Glenn that Weaver had stated he
would never be taken off the mountain and in fact had not come
down for nearly 18 months. [FN492]

     Glenn was told that Weaver was with at least one or two other
people who may also have been present during the exchange of
gunfire.  He was told that these people, as well as Weaver's
entire family, were committed to similar religious and political
beliefs, such as white separatism and supremacism and an intense
hatred of the federal government. [FN493]

     Following this briefing, Glenn travelled to the Command Post
at Ruby Ridge, arriving at approximately 9:30 p.m. (PDT).
Special Agent Wages told Glenn that it was believed that Randy
Weaver, Vicki Weaver, their children, and at least one additional
individual, Kevin Harris, were in the cabin. [FN494] Glenn began to
solicit information from Idaho State Police Major Edwin
Strickfaden, who was commanding the "predominant agency on site"
and other "senior personnel from all of the major agencies at the
scene."[FN495]  Those personnel included the U.S. Marshal for Idaho,
Michael Johnson, and Boundary County Deputy Sheriff, Lonnie
Ekstrom.

     Glenn described the shooting incident to Special Agent in
Charge William Gore, who arrived at the command post
approximately 45 minutes after Glenn.  Gore joined Glenn at the
briefing, then in progress with the Idaho State Police, Boundary
County Sheriff, and Marshals Service personnel.  They learned
that the Marshals Service was reporting that Kevin Harris may
have been shot during the shootout.  There was a report that the
marshals still on the mountain had received sporadic gunfire
until after dark. [FN496]

     U.S. Marshal Johnson provided information about BATF's
investigation of Weaver, his arrest, failure to appear, and the
entry of the Marshals Service into the case.  Weaver was
described as a "white supremacist who had been affiliated with
the Aryan Nation." [FN497]

     In spite of the fact that the marshals were rescued in the
early morning hours of August 22, first-hand information about
the incident which began the crisis was not gathered immediately
because the marshals were not made available until 2:00 p.m.
Glenn reported that he "did not have the opportunity" earlier on
to speak with any of the marshals who had been on the hill.  He
"wanted access to them but the USMS denied this request in order
to give the Deputies time to compose themselves after their
ordeal."[FN498]

     Glenn learned that first night that a cold front was
approaching, with rain, snow, and temperatures in and around the
twenties, and that the terrain around the crisis site was severe.
There was no current intelligence as to the tactical preparations
the Weavers might be making to engage law enforcement, but Glenn
knew that agents would have to take positions close to Weaver's
residence to address the situation properly.  Glenn believed that
Weaver was aware that he had been involved in killing a federal
law enforcement officer and that he was intentionally resisting
arrest.  Glenn was concerned about possible reinforcements from
the ranks of Weaver's supporters.

     Because of the information he had gathered and his
understanding of the capabilities of someone with military
training ascribed to Weaver, Glenn was seriously concerned for
the safety of personnel at the scene.  He saw Weaver as someone
"trained in the tactics of escape and evasion, who had now chosen
to fortify himself and remain at his cabin, when he could have
effected an escape from capture."  Glenn thought that he was
"facing an individual who may have made considerable prior
arrangements to inflict serious casualties or damage on any
individual(s) who may attempt to challenge him."[FN499]  Therefore,
he decided that no aggressive effort should be made to attempt to
arrest the subjects until additional tactical resources arrived.

     The goal to this point was to stabilize the situation,
avoiding contact with the Weavers until the situation had been
contained.  With the arrival of the HRT, Glenn believed it was
possible for the FBI to establish a perimeter around the Weaver
cabin to assess the situation and establish communications with
the cabin.  Glenn thought those steps were necessary to resolve
the situation peacefully through negotiations. [FN500]

     By early morning, August 22, HRT Commander Rogers and the
HRT advance unit had arrived, along with senior Marshals Service
personnel.  Rogers reported Glenn:

I asked Mr. Glenn for a quick briefing as to what the
current situation was up on the mountain.  He told me
that they had managed to get Marshal Degan's body off
and extricate the remaining marshals.  Other than that,
it was basically unknown what was taking place up
around the cabin, because there were no law enforcement
directly with eyes on at the shooting site or at the
Weaver cabin. [FN501]

     Rogers knew that the firefight was not continuing, [FN504]
but this did not change his opinion of the danger. [FN505]

                          [G.J]

  Like Glenn and Gore, Rogers did not talk to any of the
marshals involved in the shooting because he had been told that
they were asleep or were being treated for exposure. According
to Rogers, the "implication" of this report "was that they were
not available to me and that they would certainly have to be
debriefed before I would have a chance to talk to them...
debriefed I assumed by their own marshals." [FN507]

  Although Rogers had not definitively concluded that Weaver
had shot at a federal officer, he had concluded that Weaver
"clearly demonstrated that he was willing to shoot at federal
officers," in spite of the fact that he knew of no one who had
seen Weaver shoot or point a gun at anybody. [FN508]

  The next Morning, Tony Perez spoke by telephone to Cooper,
Roderick, and Norris and received "bits and fragments' of
information. [FN509] Duke Smith, Deputy Director of Operations
and the highest ranking Marshal Service official at the scene,
visited to offer emotional support. Smith did not interview the
marshals , and he received only a few details of the shooting.
[FN510] The marshals told Smith that Harris had shot Degan, that
Cooper may have killed Harris, and that Roderick shot the dog
after the gunfire had started. [FN511] One of the marshals
mentioned that Sammy Weaver was present, but there was no
evidence that he had been injured. Smith spent approximately 30
minutes at the condominium. [FN512]

  Jurgensen drove Cooper, Roderick, and Hunt to the Boundary
County Sheriff's Office for interviews by the FBI later that
day. Thomas and Norris were interviewed the following day.
[FN513]

  After the interviews, Cooper and Roderick went to the
staging area by the Rau house. They offered their assistance to
John Haynes and Lou Stagg of SOG, but were told that their help
was not needed. [FN514]

  Cooper and Roderick informed HRT members about the layout
of the Weaver complex, the terrain, and weaponry. They told the
HRT that there were no booby traps or mines on the Weaver
property. After that short debriefing, no one consulted with
Cooper and Roderick again. [FN515]

  Duke Smith recalled Jurgensen telling him that the deputy
marshals had been to the Boundary County Hospital for physical
checkups and then taken to their command post condominium at
Shweitzer Mountain. Smith recalled that Jurgensen had asked him
to postpone his visit with the five marshals, who had been part
of the August 21 team, until the afternoon of August 22. When
Smith went to the command post that afternoon, Deputy Marshals
Cooper and Roderick spoke to him about their mission but he did
not formally interview them or debrief them. [FN516] Smith said
the marshals were available to the FBI at all times and the
marshals even came to the site on Saturday and Sunday. Smith
told this inquiry that he never restricted access to the
marshals for intelligence purposes. [FN517]

  3. Discussion

   a. The Marshals' Report of the Shooting

  There have been allegations that the marshals involved in
the shooting and others in the Marshals Service intentionally
concealed the marshals' role in the August 21 shooting. It has
also been charged that the Marshals Service lied about Weaver's
dangerousness and the circumstances at the time of the shooting
to gain the FBI's support and assistance and to cover up a
confrontation with the Weavers' son, Sammy.

  At trial, the defense contended that a deputy marshal had
fired the first shot, which killed the family dog Striker.
After that shot a marshal knowingly and fatally shot Sammy
Weaver in the back as he retreated from the firefight. The
defense also contended that Sammy Weaver responded to the
killing of his dog with gunfire, which Degan returned, and that
Harris shot Degan in defense of himself and Sammy only after
these events had occurred and because they were subjected to
gunfire.

  Those who believe that sequence of events, particularly
after Weaver and Harris' acquittal for Degan's murder, have
charged that the marshals involved in the shooting engaged in a
coverup to protect themselves. That coverup is said to have
included exaggerated accounts of aggressive acts at the shootout
on August 21, Weaver's role in the events, and the danger of
Weaver and Harris. One area repeatedly challenged at trial was
the claim that the marshals were "pinned down" and had sustained
"continuing fire" hours after the fatal shots had been fired.
[FN518]

  Defense counsel alleged in pretrial motions that after the
shooting at the Y, Hunt falsely reported to his superiors and to
other law enforcement agencies that the marshals who remained
with Degan's body were "pinned down in a fire fight." [FN519] We
did not find any evidence that Hunt or any of the marshals
claimed that they were receiving continual fire well after the
exchange at the Y.

  The debate focuses on Hunt's use of the phrase "pinned
down." This inquiry has determined that "pinned down" is not a
term of art in law enforcement with a universally accepted
meaning. Although Hunt used the words "pinned down" in his
first call for help to the Boundary County Sheriff's Office
shortly after the shooting, he also repeatedly advised Marshal
Service Headquarters as the day progressed that there was no
"continuing fire fight." Less than an hour after his first call
for help, Hunt notified his superiors at Marshal Service
Headquarters that the marshals were not receiving continual
fire. He also reported this to other law enforcement officers
arriving at the scene. [FN520]

  Officials from many different law enforcement agencies
were told throughout the remainder of the day that the marshals
were "pinned down." [FN521] If they concluded that the marshals
were under constant fire, that was the result, in our view, of
miscommunication or misunderstanding. [FN522] Hunt's reports to
the Crisis Center are consistent with the accounts given by the
marshals on the mountain. They believed they were "pinned down"
in the sense that they were "outflanked" by the Weavers and
might come under fire if they moved. [FN523] We conclude that
the marshals did not deliberately attempt to mislead other law
enforcement agencies about the events at the Y or the condition
of the marshals still on the mountain.

   b. Decision to Deploy the HRT

  Our investigation found that the HRT was properly deployed
to Idaho to address this crisis, a deployment, which, in
accordance with FBI policy, had received specific approval from
the Assistant director of the Criminal Investigative Division at
FBI Headquarters.

  The training of HRT members and its ability to be deployed
quickly made HRT a reasonable choice in this instance.

 Furthermore, jurisdiction for the investigation of assaults on
federal officers ("AFO") rests with the FBI. Although this
began as a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms case and
became a Marshals Service case, the Marshals Service does not
have primary jurisdiction for investigating AFOs. In addition,
Marshals Service supervisors were understandably concerned that
action by the Marshals Service would appear to have been taken
in retaliation.

  The federal law enforcement response to the crisis at Ruby
Ridge has been seen by some as an inappropriate insertion of the
federal government into a local matter, which would have been
better left to the state and local authorities to resolve. In
particular, the federal government has been criticized for
overreacting and overwhelming the area. As evidence of the
ability of local and state forces to have handled the crisis, we
not the rapid response they made to the stranded marshals and
the successful night rescue.

  Various state and local law enforcement agencies were
included in the early stages of intelligence gathering, and they
played a continuing critical role in controlling the perimeter
and keeping the peace during this controversial siege. However,
it appears that they were not part of strategy and planning
sessions as the siege continued.

  We can understand the opinion that Idaho State and local
law enforcement should have led the efforts to resolve the
crisis. However, it appears this is an after-the-fact view of
events. Arguably, if the federal government had not responded
to the crisis at Ruby Ridge, that inaction would also have been
criticized. This situation had been generated by a federal
warrant based on a federal indictment involving federal law
enforcement agencies. In attempting to effectuate a federal
arrest, a federal officer had been killed, and the subjects of
that shooting and the outstanding warrant remained at large. In
light of these circumstances and the resources available to the
federal response teams, we find reasonable and appropriate the
decision to send FBI SWAT teams, the HRT, and the Marshals
Service SOG to resolve this matter.

   c. Initial Intelligence Gathering

  In this section we discuss what the FBI did in the first
36 hours to verify the information it had obtained and to secure
the best and most current information. Our investigation
addressed criticism concerning the failure of Special Agent in
Charge Glenn and HRT Commander Richard Rogers during their first
hours at the site to update intelligence from more knowledgeable
people present.

  Almost within hours of setting up the command centers at
Marshal Service Crisis Center and FBI Headquarters, both
agencies had representatives at each other's command centers to
aid communication. [FN524] The Crisis Center log reflects
regular communications with the FBI SIOC. Although efforts to
facilitate communications were made at Headquarters, we did not
find intelligence gathering at the site to have been
sufficiently thorough under the circumstances. Although Glenn
spoke with the heads of the agencies at the scene, there were
gaps in Glenn and Rogers' information about the underlying
events caused by their failure to debrief the marshals involved
in the shootout.

  We not specifically Glenn's failure to discuss the
situation with Deputy Marshal Hunt, who had been present at the
command post until the marshals and Degan's body had been
rescued from the mountain. Hunt had been the primary source of
information to Marshal Service Headquarters throughout the day,
and he was the link with the other marshals who had been
eyewitnesses to the day's events. Moreover, Hunt had been the
lead case agent in Boise since 1991 and would have been the most
valuable resource for information on the Weavers background and
their circumstances.

  Rogers and Glenn also failed to discuss the situation with
the other marshals at the site the next day. During this
inquiry, we reviewed a videotape made at the site during Hunt's
second briefing at the command post. The briefing contained
valuable information based on intelligence the Marshals Service
and especially Hunt had gathered over many months of
surveillance. Significantly, Glenn admitted that when he was
formulating the operational plan and Rules of Engagement, he was
unaware that the Marshals Service had been on numerous missions
to Ruby Ridge before August 21. [FN525]

  When questioned about the failure to interview the
marshals, Glenn asserted that they were not made available after
his arrival. We find little support for this assertion. Duke
Smith, who had arrived with Rogers and was at the command site
most of the day, knew where the marshals were. We found no
evidence that anyone denied the FBI access to the marshals after
they had been taken to the hospital and allowed to rest. In
fact, the marshals felt ignored by those who had taken command.
This feeling may have been justified.

  This inquiry also considered whether the Marshals Service
tried to prepare the marshals for their interviews. FBI agents
assigned to interview the marshals had been told to expect them
the morning after the shooting. However, the marshals did not
arrive until later in the day. Deputy Marshal Jurgensen, who
had been ordered to look after the marshals once they were off
the mountain, was not notified that the marshals were scheduled
for interviews on Saturday morning. [FN526] We are satisfied
that there was no impropriety regarding the timing of the
marshals' appearance.

  We also find no evidence that the marshals were coached
before their interviews. We note that the marshals were kept
together for several hours before giving their statements. We
question the wisdom of keeping the marshals together at the
condominium for several hours, while awaiting interviews with
the FBI. Isolating them in that manner created the appearance
and generated allegations that they were fabricating stories and
colluding to coverup the true circumstances of the shootings at
the Y. These allegations could have been avoided by separating
the witnesses until their interviews and debriefings. However,
we acknowledge that security and health interests may have made
such an arrangement appear necessary on the first evening
following the rescue. However, this investigation has found no
proof that the Marshals Service or the marshals themselves
coordinated or altered their individual accounts of the events
on the mountain. Certainly, there are enough differences in the
marshals' statements to diffuse an accusation of collusion.

  Although the marshals had lengthy interviews on Saturday
and Sunday with FBI agents and returned to the command post on
Saturday and Sunday, none of them were interviewed by the FBI
senior management team of Glenn, Rogers, or Fred Lanceley, the
FBI's chief negotiator at the scene. In fact, Lanceley was not
aware of the FBI interviews of the marshals until days later.
It is not clear when the information developed in these
interviews was shared with Glenn and Rogers.

  This inquiry found no misrepresentation of the status of
the marshals as they remained on the mountain. Glenn and FBI
Headquarters knew that there had been no gunfire after the
original shooting, with the exception of shots at a passing
aircraft. The term "pinned down" was not understood or intended
to indicate the marshals were taking continuous fire. [FN527]

  It is difficult to estimate the impact additional
intelligence gathering would have had on the decisions made
during the crisis. Much of the information the FBI considered
in assessing the danger and formulating Rules of Engagement and
operational plans was consistent with what they would have heard
from the marshals.

  Marshals Service Headquarters files contained information
from BATF and other sources during the threat assessment and the
eighteen-month fugitive investigation by the Marshals Service.
The files included information about Weaver's military
experience, his stockpiling of weapons and ammunition, the
arming of the Weaver family, his Aryan Nations affiliation, and
his refusal to surrender. We found the background information
on Weaver, which the Marshals Service have the FBI and which
served as a basis for the HRT deployment and the development of
plans to secure the site, consistent with the information that
was available in the Marshals Service files before August 21.

  4. Conclusion

  We found no evidence that the Marshals Service
intentionally covered up or exaggerated Weaver's background or
the events that had occurred at the Y in order to obtain
assistance from other law enforcement personnel. However, we
did find that the initial intelligence gathering by the FBI
lacked thoroughness because of its failure early in the crisis
to seek information from the Marshals Service personnel who had
been ion the mountain on August 21. Finally, this inquiry found
that there was no abuse of discretion in the activation of the
HRT in this situation. It was legally and factually justified
and consistent with department of Justice policy and procedures.
No evidence was discovered during this inquiry that the decision
to deploy HRT was based on improper or personal motives.

contained some errors, such as a statement in paragraph 4 that
the marshals "were fired upon by two or more individuals in a

thought that this information had come to Mays directly from

took no steps to confirm the information because he thought that
Howen had corrected any factual inaccuracies.  Almost immediately
after the affidavit was transmitted to Howen, he told Haws that
paragraph 4 was in error.  Howen and Haw corrected the error in

This case is unique and complicated because of all the
juvenile people that [Weaver] has up there . . . . For
the last two years we have looked at this situation
trying to come up with a way to separate him from his
children.  his defensive tactics have basically always
been to keep the kids around . . .  [O]ur tactics on
him have been to figure out a way to watch him,
observe, figure out a way that we could get him without
confronting, the juveniles with weapons.

Service first learned of the shooting when Deputy Marshal hunt
called Marshals Service headquarters in Washington, DC  The first
entry in the Marshals Service Crisis Center Log noted:  "The
initial reports indicate that the USMS surveillance team came
under fire from occupants of the Weaver compound and are still
pinned down in defensive positions."  Entry for August 21, 1992,
at 2:40 p.m. (EDT).  Soon thereafter the log states:  "The rest
of the team is still located on the mountain, but not under fire,
unable to withdraw without exposing themselves to hostile fire."
Id. at 3:05 p.m. (EDT).  This was confirmed one hour later:
"USMS personnel on mountain are not taking additional fire and

The HRT is comprised of approximately 50 members with specialized
skills and training.  The HRT has been utilized in a variety of
high risk situations since its formation in 1993, ranging from
international antiterrorist operations to prison uprisings,
arrest/search operations against white separatist organizations,
and hostage situations.

     475 Potts Sworn Statement, December 17, 1993, at 4-5.
Coulson viewed HRT as well suited for crises of this sort
because:

The HRT could better function in such a severe environment,
and was highly trained in winter and rural operations.  The
HRT can deploy a sophisticated communications system,
including satellite communication, which would be necessary
in this remote rural mountainous environment.  The HRT also
provides and deploys with medical support which would be a
necessity in such a dangerous operation . . . . FBI field
office SWAT Teams could not have enough personnel to handle
a situation such as this.

Coulson Sworn Statement, November 3, 1993, at 7.

to provide transportation for HRT had expired and that the
current arrangement was for the military to provide
transportation on an "as needed" basis.  Gow Sworn Statement, at

[W]ithin a few minutes of their return, the rescued
marshals were whisked away from the area of the command
post to a location unknown by me.  The decision to
remove the marshals involved in the shooting was made
by the Marshals Service.  I did not have an opportunity
to see any of them and I  do not believe any of them
had been debriefed for benefit of intelligence purposes
with respect to the shooting and related events that
day.

Headquarters and Smith. Rogers Trial Testimony, June 2, 1993,
at 189-90. Rogers also admitted during cross examination at
trial that he had no information as to who killed Degan and that
he had never spoken to Cooper or Roderick during his entire stay
at Ruby Ridge.

   508 Rogers assumed that Glenn had received his information
from marshals on the scene and, therefore, did not inquire about
the source or validity of the information.

   513 FBI agents had been told to expect the marshals at the
Boundary County Sheriff's Office on Saturday morning, August 22.
Hunt, Roderick and Cooper were not brought to the Sheriff's
Office until that afternoon. FD-302 Interview of Gregory
Rampton, October 18 & 19, 1993, at 3; FD-302 Interview of

that Haynes "blew me off," saying, "I've already heard your
story." Cooper Sworn Statement, at 12-13.

  On August 23, Cooper reviewed a draft report of his
interview and found it full of inaccuracies. For instance, the
draft stated that Cooper saw a second man chasing the marshals
in the fern field, that Cooper saw Randy Weaver at the "Y" after
Harris shot Degan, and that Cooper saw Harris running up the
trail toward Weaver's cabin. Cooper asked that the draft be
corrected. Because this had not been done when Cooper returned
from Degan's funeral, Cooper dictated the FD-302 himself. Id.
at 13.

   515 Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 30.

   516 Cooper and Roderick told Smith that Degan was shot by
Harris after Degan announced "U.S. Marshals." Cooper thought he
shot Harris because he saw Harris go down and never saw him
again. Roderick returned fire and shot the dog and both
mentioned they had seen Randy Weaver coming down the other
trail. Roderick told Smith how he took a round through his
shirt and that there were a lot of incoming rounds. Weaver had
turned and gone back up the hill after the initial shots. One
of the marshals mentioned seeing Sammy Weaver but there was no
mention of him being injured in the gun fight. Smith Sworn
Statement, January 6, 1994, at 6.

   517 Id. at 8.

   518 Briefly, our investigation found no intentional
exaggeration of facts or a failure to disclose material facts.
Moreover, we were unable to find any material representations
made to FBI Headquarters which were unsupported by information
in Marshals Service files. In our interviews, FBI Headquarters
personnel and Marshals Service personnel did not report any
significant incorrect information on the status of the marshals
on the mountain, in contrast to media reports on the subject.

   519 Defendants' Memorandum, at 8-10.

   520 For instance, FBI Special Agent Larry Wages arrived at
approximately 3:30 p.m. He had the impression from Hunt that
the stranded marshals were "pinned down," though he does not
recall whether Hunt used those words. He understood from Hunt
that the marshals were not in an ongoing firefight. Wages
surmised that anyone trying to approach the stranded marshals
might receive gunfire. He also believed that the marshals could
have come down had they been willing to leave Degan's body.
Wages did not hear gunfire during his stay at the Rau field.
FD-302 Interview of Larry Wages, November 29, 1993, at 2; McGill
FD-302, at 3 (dispatcher notes time of Wages' arrival).

  Sgt. Michael R. Nauman, a member of the Idaho State Police
team that rescued the marshals, said that he knew during the
rescue that no shots had been fired for several hours. He
believed the marshals "felt they were pinned down because they
did not know where Harris and Weaver were and believed that
[Harris and Weaver] were watching their position." FD-302 of
Sgt. Michael R. Nauman, October 7, 1993, at 2.

   521 For example, at approximately 12:17 p.m.. (PDT), Perez
told Kenneth E. Neu, Acting Chief of the FBI Fugitive Unit, that
"the marshals were still on the mountain and were pinned down by
gunfire." FD-302 Interview of Kenneth Neu, November 5, 1993.
This was more than a half hour after Hunt advised the Crisis
Center that the marshals were "no longer taking fire." Crisis
Center Log, August 21, 1992, at 11:40 a.m. PDT.

   522 Twomey said that communications were bad and that it was
"virtually impossible to get accurate information." Twomey FD

IV. SPECIFIC ISSUES INVESTIGATED 

  F. FBI's Rules of Engagement and Operations on August 21 and
August 22, 1992 

  1. Introduction 

  The issues addressed in this part of our inquiry concern the
initial response to the crisis by law enforcement agencies
directed by the FBI and the decisions made to resolve the
crisis. 

  During the early hours of the crisis, in addition to the
movement of personnel and equipment, the primary concerns were
to stabilize the situation and to gather intelligence. 
Throughout this early period, FBI officials were formulating a
proposed plan of action -- also referred to as an "operation
plan" or "operational plan" -- and specialized "Rules of
Engagement" ("Rules"). 

  It has been alleged that during this initial period
negotiations were ignored as a strategy and that only tactical
responses were considered. Indeed, the FBI has been criticized
for its failure to contact the occupants of the Weaver residence
until Saturday evening, after the sniper shots had been fired
and Vicki Weaver had been killed. We have been told by observers
on the scene that law enforcement personnel made statements that
the matter would be handled quickly and that the situation would
be "taken down hard and fast." [FN528] Some individuals have
contended that the helicopter flights over the Weaver compound
were designed to lure the subjects out so that they could be
targets for the snipers who were under orders to shoot and kill
armed adult men. 

  Furthermore, it has been alleged that the FBI's operations
plan and Rules of Engagement were developed to eliminate
witnesses to the shootout on August 21 in retaliation for the
death of Deputy Marshal Degan. Of particular concern are the
Rules of Engagement, which instructed the FBI Hostage Rescue
Team ("HRT") sniper/observers that they "can and should" use
deadly force against any armed adult male, even before a
surrender announcement had been made to the subjects or notice
given that law enforcement was present. The Rules have been
interpreted as unlawful "orders to shoot" by their severest
critics and as being inappropriate for the situation or being
unartfully drafted by others. It has been charged that the Rules
used at Ruby Ridge were orders to shoot, which violated federal
and state law and the FBI's own standard policy on the use of
deadly force. 

  In this section we examine the factors considered in the
formulation of the Rules and the reasonableness of some of these
considerations, including the belief that the Weaver/Harris
group was aware of law enforcement's presence and that every
armed individual in the Weaver compound intended to cause bodily
harm to law enforcement personnel. We also examine the intent of
those who reviewed and approved the Rules and whether the Rules
and the procedures used to develop and authorize their use
conformed with FBI policy. 

  Finally, we evaluate those who operated under the Rules of
Engagement and the actions they took while at Ruby Ridge. This
portion of the report examines the circumstances surrounding the
two rifle shots fired by HRT member Lon Horiuchi on August 22,
1992 and whether the ensuing death and injuries were the result
of lawful acts. 

  2. Statement of Facts 

  a. The Formulation of Rules of engagement En Route to Idaho
on August 21, 1992 

  When FBI tactical teams, such as HRT or SWAT, are deployed and
confrontations are a possibility, Rules of Engagement are
commonly established. Rules of Engagement are described as
instructions to deployed units or individuals that clearly
indicate what action should be taken when confronted,
threatened, or fired upon by someone. They are intended to
provide a context within which decisions about the use of deadly
force are to be made. They serve two purposes: to restrict the
application of the standard FBI deadly force policy or to
heighten the awareness of tactical personnel regarding the
threat level of individual situations. Formulation and approval
of the Rules of Engagement are the responsibility of the on-
scene commander. [FN529] 

  The need for special Rules of Engagement for the Ruby Ridge
crisis was discussed and agreed upon at an early point. While
en route to Northern Idaho, Richard Rogers, Commander of the
HRT, and Assistant Director Larry Potts had a series of
conversations in which Potts advised Rogers of intelligence
received. [FN530] 

  [G.J.] 

  [G.J.] 

  [FN531] 

  Rogers explained his initial thoughts about the Rules of
Engagement: 

  In this particular situation, after hearing the description of
what had taken place, specifically the fire-fight, the loss of a
marshal, it was clear to me that there was a shooting situation
taking place at this location. It appeared to me that it would
have been irresponsible for me to send my agents into the
situation without at least giving them a set of rules within the
greater framework of the standard FBI rules, that would allow
them to defend themselves. With that in mind, I proposed that
the rules be that if any adult is seen with a weapon in the
vicinity of where this fire-fight took place, of the Weaver
cabin, that this individual could be the subject of deadly
force... [A]ny child is going to come under standard FBI rules,
meaning that if an FBI agent is threatened with death or some
other innocent is threatened with death by a child, then clearly
that agent could use a weapon to shoot the child... that's the
way it's stated, but quite frankly, we try to prevent ourselves
from being put in positions where children can threaten us and
where we would have to use deadly force. [FN532] 

  When asked if he had considered the possibility that an adult
might be seen with a weapon slung on his shoulder or carried in
a nonoffensive way, Rogers replied: 

  Yes, it was considered, and it's always my knowledge that my
sniper observers and my other team members are clearly going to
make a judgmental call as to whether to employ deadly force, and
based upon the training, based upon the experience of these men,
I know that they have absolutely the best judgment when it comes
to use of deadly force. [FN533] 

  Rogers acknowledged that the Rules of Engagement he proposed
specified that any adult with a weapon observed in the vicinity
of the Weaver cabin or in the firefight area "could and should
be the subject of deadly force." [FN534] According to Rogers he
discussed this rule with FBI Assistant Director Larry Potts who
concurred fully. [FN535] 

  [G.J.] [FN536] 

  Potts considered the information provided by the Marshals
Service to be the basis of the proposed Rules of Engagement. He
recalled the proposed Rules of Engagement as providing that: 

  Any adult with a weapon who was observed in the vicinity of
Randall Weaver's cabin or the fire fight area, COULD be the
subject of deadly force. All efforts should be made to avoid any
confrontation with children, but if such a confrontation became
unavoidable, that faced with the threat of death or grievous
bodily harm, the standard FBI use of deadly force policy would
be in effect. [FN537] 

  According to Potts, he and Coulson believed that this crisis
was the most dangerous situation into which the HRT had ever
gone. Potts recalled that: 

  I was extremely fearful of sustaining casualties while
attempting to establish a perimeter at the crisis site, since 
the subjects possessed every tactical advantage. I was concerned
that the subjects had been reinforced by others, and I 
considered every armed adult in the vicinity of the Weaver 
cabin to be potentially hostile and a threat to HRT personnel.
I believed that Randy Weaver knew that a warrant existed for
him, and knew a DUSM had been killed, he would have known that
law enforcement personnel would be in the vicinity. I was also
concerned that the deceased DUSM may not have made and immediate
determination of the threat and had lost his life as a result... 

  These ROE were established to assist the HRT personnel in
making a determination regarding what constituted a threat to
them in this extraordinary circumstance. The ROE were not
intended to supersede the FBI standard deadly force policy. The
final determination regarding such implementation of deadly
force must always remain with the individual... and each
individual must make an individual, final determination of
threat. [FN538] 

  Potts did not discuss the Rules of Engagement with the FBI's
Legal Counsel Office during this crisis. He noted that legal
review is not usually solicited because Rules of Engagement are
written to fall within the bounds of the FBI's standard deadly
force policy. 

  Michael Kahoe, Section Chief of the Violent Crimes and Major
Offenders Section FBI Criminal Investigative Division at FBI
Headquarters, spoke to John Sauls, Supervisory Special Agent
with the Legal Instruction Unit at the FBI Academy, on August 21
at approximately 5:00 p.m. (EDT) about the Rules for the crisis
in Idaho. Sauls told Kahoe that two primary assessments needed
to be made. First, there should be a determination of
"dangerousness," that is, whether there was probably cause to
believe that someone had caused or attempted to cause death or
serious bodily harm to agents or other persons. According to
Sauls, the fact that the subjects had apparently intentionally
fired upon and killed a marshal indicated that they were
dangerous. Second, Sauls spoke of the need to assess the
"necessity" to use deadly force to resolve the crisis situation 
and to gain "control" of the situation or to protect the lives
of other individuals. [FN539] 

  Sauls told Kahoe that the element of dangerousness could be
assessed by persons who were not at the scene. However, the
second element of necessity could be determined only by on-scene
personnel. Sauls defined having control of the situation as
being when a subject was "in custody" and not merely forced into
a position where movement was restricted, such as in a fortified
house. [FN540] 

  Kahoe asked Sauls "if agents encounter armed adults in the
compound (around the Weaver house), would deadly force be
permitted?" Sauls responded that deadly force would be permitted
"if they refuse to surrender." However, Sauls stressed that he
meant that on-scene personnel had permission to use deadly
force, but that it was certainly not required. According to
Sauls, only the agents at the scene could decide whether deadly
force was necessary. [FN541] 

  Around 6:30 or 7:00 p.m. (EDT) on August 21, Kahoe told Sauls
that a plan was being formulated to permit snipers to fire at
Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris from concealed positions around
the Weaver cabin. Sauls explained that, as long as there was a
"continued demand for surrender which the subjects continued to
ignore, and they maintained themselves in a barricaded
situation" the use of the tactics described by Kahoe would be
permissible and within the FBI's deadly force policy. [FN542] 

  No additional legal advice regarding the Rules was solicited
from within the FBI. The legal advisor from the FBI's Salt Lake
City Division was not at the scene. He reported that after the
first few days all legal advice came from the Office of Legal
Counsel, FBI Headquarters. Indeed, he was never consulted about
the Rules of Engagement and was unaware of their existence until
sometime after the siege had terminated. [FN543] 

  Nor did the FBI officials drafting the Rules consult with the
United States Attorney's Office having jurisdiction over the 
crisis. Assistant U.S. Attorney Ron Howen arrived at the crisis
site shortly after the crisis began and remained there until the
situation was resolved. While at the crisis scene, he provided
legal advice and legal assistance regarding the preparation of
legal documents, such as an affidavit supporting the
government's request to obtain electronic surveillance of the
cabin, and he forwarded information to the U.S. Attorney in
Boise. Howen did not participate in any discussion about the
operations plan or Rules of Engagement, and he was not involved
in formulating or approving any of the operations plans or the
Rules of Engagement. The local Boundary County prosecutor, who
was also on site during the crisis, was also not consulted. 

  Coulson recalls that the proposed Rules of Engagement "were
words to the effect of 'any armed adult outside the Weaver cabin
or on Ruby Ridge could be the subject of deadly force.'" [FN544]
The basis for these Rules was Coulson's belief that the subjects
knew that law enforcement personnel were on the scene and that a
marshal had been shot after the slain marshal had announced his
presence. Furthermore, Coulson believed that a "call out" or
surrender announcement was not feasible in the early stages of
the operation. Coulson reasoned: 

  If the subjects had retreated and had barricaded themselves in
the Weaver cabin, it was my belief that the only reason for this
could be for an armed confrontation with law enforcement
officers. It was my belief that as soon as the HRT personnel
arrived in the area, they would be in grave peril.... It was
also my belief that it was a possibility that supporters of
Randy Weaver would attempt to reinforce him and assist in armed
resistance. Due to the uncontained and remote nature of the
crisis site, I was gravely concerned that this either had
occurred or would occur. I was concerned that Weaver and or his
associates would tactically move about in order to ambush law
enforcement personnel. I believed that HRT personnel might
observe subjects preparing to ambush law enforcement components
who did not realize they were being threatened. [FN545] 

  Coulson considered the children in the Weaver cabin hostages
because he assumed that they did not have the option of leaving
voluntarily. Notwithstanding this belief, he feared that the
children might shoot at law enforcement personnel, who attempted
to rescue the marshals. In the early stages, Coulson did not
know whether they might be captured if not immediately rescued.
Coulson believed that Weaver's family and his associates would
defend him and that Weaver's supporters would attempt to
reinforce Weaver and assist in armed resistance. He believed
that the subjects had already demonstrated their willingness and
ability to kill law enforcement personnel because they had shot
deputy Marshal Degan after he had identified himself as a
marshal. Coulson believed that the individuals inside the Weaver
cabin knew that law enforcement personnel were outside the cabin
and, thus, he reasoned that if an armed adult appeared outside
the Weaver residence with the weapon, it was reasonable to
assume that the individual intended to commit hostile acts
against law enforcement personnel. 

  In addition, Coulson was aware of the possibility that Randy
Weaver had Explosives/Ordnance Device training due to his army
experience, and believed that Weaver had received Special Forces
training, designed to give a tactical advantage to small groups
of highly trained people. Because of Weaver's Army experience
and his history as a white separatist, Coulson expected that the
Weaver property might contain fortifications and remote
-controlled explosive devices. Coulson was aware that which
separatists frequently armed family members, including wives and
children, that they fortified their property against assault,
engaged in tactical training with associates, usually belonged
to highly trained, heavily armed groups, and were extremely
dangerous and frequently willing to engage law enforcement
personnel. [FN546] 

  After Potts had approved the Rules of Engagement, Rogers told
Smith that HRT believed that the Rules should be modified
because of the circumstances of which they were aware. Smith
understood the Rules as allowing "any adult armed with a long
arm outside of the cabin to be shot." Smith told this inquiry
that he had never modified standard Marshals Service shooting
policy, which, he noted, is similar to that of other law
enforcement agencies and allows deadly force to be used when
human life is in danger. He interpreted the FBI's Ruby Ridge
Rules as more liberal than the Marshal Service's standard
policy. Nevertheless, he thought the Rules were appropriate,
reasonable, and necessary in this case because it was probably
that a federal marshal or agent would be confronted by armed
individuals. Smith was concerned that law enforcement personnel
could be harmed during the operation. 

  Smith was not called upon to approve the Rules of Engagement
because the FBI was responsible for the tactical operation.
Nonetheless, he briefed the director Hudson and Twomey on the
Rules and relayed them to Special Operations Group ("SOG")
Commander John Haynes when he arrived at the command post. Smith
intended that the marshals operate under the same Rules of
Engagement as the FBI because the FBI was in charge of an
operation, for which the Marshals Service would provide support. 

  Smith recalls that the Rules were changed, so that "any adult
male who is armed with a rifle should be neutralized". He
understood "adult males" to include Kevin Harris, Randy Weaver,
and any other male carrying weapons whom the agents or marshals
encountered on the mountain. [FN547] Although he did not recall
the operative words "can and should" in the Rules, he did not
interpret those words as mandating that marshals or agents
shoot. Smith stated, "there was nothing said that would cause a
deputy or agent to substitute these rules for good judgment." 
[FN548] 

  b. Formulation of the Rules of Engagement and Operations
plan on August 22 

  When the remaining HRT members arrived, they went to the
National Guard Armory in Bonner's Ferry, Idaho, where HRT 
Commander Rogers briefed them at 9:00 a.m. (PDT). [FN549] Rogers
told the HRT members and SOG snipers that the Rules of
Engagement had not yet been approved, and that HRT
sniper/observer coordinator Lester Hazen would brief the
sniper/observers before their deployment. The proposed Rules of
Engagement provided at the initial briefing were: 

  Any adult with a weapon who was observed in the vicinity of
Randall Weaver's cabin or the fire fight area, could and should
be the subject of deadly force. 

  Following he briefing, the HRT travelled to Ruby Creek at the
base of the mountain on which the Weaver cabin was located and
began to establish tactical operations centers. This involved
unloading and erecting command and bunk tents, clerical
equipment and supplies, and weapons systems. Some HRT members
began to assimilate the massive amount of information provided
by the Marshals Service and local law enforcement agencies. 
[FN550] 

  While these organizational activities were in progress, HRT
supervisors were engaged in the drafting of the operational
plan. McGavin prepared the original draft of the Rules. After
reviewing this draft, Rogers told McGavin to scratch out what he
had originally written and the proceeded to discuss with McGavin
and Hazen what he wanted in the Rules. Rogers told McGavin to
insert the "and should" clause into the Rules. McGavin believed
that Rogers inserted those words to convey his perception, based
on the briefing he had received, of the extreme risk posed by
Weaver. [FN551] Hazen contributed the final paragraph to the
Rules. Rogers testified that the words that comprised the Rules
were his words and that McGavin and Hazen wrote them down to
provide the sniper/observers and other team members with Rules
that "clearly reflect what I know I had approved through our
chain of command." [FN552] These rules were: 

  If any adult in the compound is observed with a weapon after
the surrender announcement is made, deadly force can and should
be employed to neutralize this individual. 

  If any adult male is observed with a weapon prior to the
announcement deadly force can and should be employed if a shot
can be taken without endangering the children. 

  If compromised by any dog the dog can be taken out. 

  Any subject other than R, V, + K, presenting threat of death or
grievous bodily harm FBI rules of deadly force apply. [FN553] 

  Once at the site, Rogers proposed to Glenn that several things
be done quickly. First, communication should be established with
the people in the cabin or in bunkers, if there were any. Next,
Rogers wanted to "call-out," to let the subjects know that the
FBI was there and that there were warrants for their arrest.
Finally, and most importantly, he wanted to ask them and give
them the chance to surrender to law enforcement authorities,
which, according to Rogers, is "standard procedure." [FN554]
Since law enforcement personnel had not surrounded the cabin,
Rogers also wanted to place sniper/observers around the site to
cover law enforcement personnel and to cordon the site. [FN555] 

  Rogers testified that when the FBI makes an arrest, it tries
to notify the subjects of the arrest that the FBI is present
with a legitimate arrest warrant. This surrender announcement or
"call-out" was going to be accomplished in this instance by
agents going to the cabin area in armored personnel carriers and
broadcasting the message with a megaphone or loud hailer. At the
same time, the agents would drop off a phone at the site.
[FN556] Rogers considered armored personnel carriers necessary
protection for his agents. He saw no alternative to taking a
phone to the cabin in the carrier beaus of the offensive posture
the Weavers and Harris had taken. [FN557] 

  Along with these plans, Rogers submitted the proposed Rules of
Engagement to Glenn at a morning meeting also attended by Gore,
Rogers, Smith, and HRT and Marshals Service supervisors. At the
meeting, a number of options were discussed. [FN558] One plan
Rogers suggested involved the HRT first establishing a perimeter
around the compound followed by the Marshals service making a
tactical entry into the cabin. When this proposal was presented
to Louis Stagg, Deputy Commander of the SOG, Stagg recused his
personnel from this task because he was concerned that any
injuries to or deaths of the subjects might be construed as
retaliation by the Marshals Service. Thereafter, it was agreed
that the HRT would perform the entry, if necessary, but that one
marshal would participate in making the formal arrests. [FN559] 

  Glenn's assessment of the level of threat presented by the
situation affected the development of the Rules of Engagement. 
He believed that Weaver's children were well trained and capable
of firing at law enforcement and he knew at the same time that
law enforcement officers are reluctant to fire at children, even
when their own lives are in danger. Therefore, he was greatly
concerned that tactical personnel on the inner perimeter and
personnel attempting to assault the cabin might be exposed to
serious injury from the children. Glenn was also extremely
concerned that subjects leaving the cabin with firearms would
pose a danger to law enforcement personnel because they were
well versed on the terrain while the agents and officers had
virtually no knowledge of the mountainous conditions or the
"booby traps" possibly in place. Finally, Glenn worried that if
any subjects entered the "bunker network" which might exist,
they could fire on law enforcement officers in a manner that
would make an effective response or defense impossible. [FN560] 

  [G.J.] 

  [G.J.] [FN561] 

  When the HRT is activated, a proposed operation plan is
written for resolving the situation. According to Rogers, when
the HRT faces "a hostage situation or a barricaded subject
situation, such as at Ruby Ridge," the plan includes "a proposed
tactical resolution" that includes an "assault" or "a plan to
send people inside the building to effect an arrest." [FN562] 

  Any deliberate assaults must be approved by FBI Headquarters.
The plan for such an assault is contained in an operations plan.
At Ruby Ridge, McGavin prepared such a plan. McGavin discussed
a deliberate assault with Rogers and told him he did not want to
send a team into a situation in which an encounter with armed
children seemed likely and agents might have to kill a child to
defend themselves. Rogers agreed, but recognized that an
operations plan had to be written. McGavin wrote a plan
realizing that the crisis should be resolved, if at all
possible, through action designed to minimize the prospect of
armed engagement with the subjects. [FN563] 

  McGavin drafted a plan, which included the travel of armored
personnel carriers ("APCs") to the Weaver compound, attempts to
contact Weaver with a loudspeaker or hostage phone, and the
establishment of a 360 degree perimeter. Glenn, with the
understanding that the situation was "extremely dangerous and
highly volatile," approved the following Rules of Engagement in
the plan before sending the plan to FBI Headquarters for
approval: 

  1. If any adult male is observed with a weapon prior to the
announcement, deadly force can and should be employed, if the
shot can be taken without endangering any children. 

  2. If any adult in the compound is observed with a weapon
after the surrender announcement is made, and is not attempting
to surrender, deadly force can and should be employed to
neutralize the individual. 

  3. If compromised by any animal, particularly the dogs, that
animal should be eliminated. 

  4. Any subjects other than Randall Weaver, Vicki Weaver, Kevin
Harris, presenting threats of death or grievous bodily harm, the
FBI rules of deadly force are in effect. Deadly force can be
utilized to prevent the death or grievous bodily injury to
oneself or that of another. [FN564] 

  According to the Marshals Service Crisis Center log, the
operation plan was being assembled by HRT and SOG at 10:30 a.m.
(PDT) on August 22. At noon, it was reported that the
"operations plan [was] going forward to insert sniper team. 
Team should be in place in approximately two hours." [FN565] 
According to the plan, after the sniper teams were in position,
the FBI negotiation team would move forward and attempt to
contact the subjects. However, one half hour later, it was
reported that the FBI was having difficulty obtaining armored
personnel carriers. An entry in the crisis center log stated:
"General Manning of the Idaho National Guard has refused to
provide vehicle support to the FBI." [FN566] At 1:50 p.m. (PDT)
U.S. Marshal Michael Johnson reported that SOG and HRT had
completed the operational plan which he described as follows: 

  1. Contain perimeter of compound with HRT snipers. 

  2. Two armored personnel carriers will be deployed to the
compound and loud speakers will be used to order the suspects to
surrender. 

  3. If Weaver or his older son (sic) Exit the residence armed
the snipers will neutralize them. 

  4. If there is no contact, then the APCs will retreat leaving
the snipers in place. 

  5. The following day the APCs will return and again order the
suspects to surrender. 

  6. If no compliance, the APCs will begin dismantling the
outlying buildings by ramming them. 

  7. If no compliance, tear gas will be deployed into the main
house. [FN567] 

  Gore believed that the operational plan that he, Glenn, and
Rogers developed fully considered the merits of a negotiation
strategy as opposed to a tactical resolution of the situation.
He explained: 

  our objective was clearly the peaceful resolution of the
crisis. A means of delivery of a hostage telephone to the
Weaver compound, to secure a telephonic link between the command
post and the crisis site could not be established prior to the
deployment of sniper observers, and prior to the actual
placement of the telephone, the negotiation strategy was not
made a part of the initial operational plan.... [FN568] 

  After the initial plan had been drafted, Gore and the others
consulted with Johnson, Smith, and Stagg of the Marshal's
Service, who opposed the plan. [FN569] At approximately 2:40 
p.m. (PDT) on August 22, an operations plan, which included the
Rules of Engagement, was sent by facsimile to FBI Headquarters
and the Marshals Service for review. The Rules in the operations
plan as submitted to the Bureau for review stated: 

  If any adult in the compound is observed with a weapon after
the surrender announcement is made, deadly force CAN AND SHOULD
be employed to neutralize this individual. If any adult male is
observed with a weapon prior to the announcement, deadly force
CAN AND SHOULD be employed, if the shot can be taken without
endangering any children. [Emphasis added.] [FN570] 

  FBI Deputy Assistant Director Coulson received the operations
plan at the FBI Headquarters' Strategic Information and
Operations Center; he did not approve the draft plan because it
lacked a negotiations option. Coulson stopped reviewing the plan
once he realized a negotiation option was absent. Thus, he never
saw or reviewed the Rules of Engagement in the plan which
appeared after the section in which a negotiations strategy
should have appeared. [FN571] 

  After completing his partial review of the operations plan,
Coulson made certain observations and raised certain questions
in a facsimile to Glenn: 

  1. No mention is made of Sniper Observer deployment as of 5:30
p.m. EST 2:30 PST (sic). 

  2. What intelligence has been gathered from the crisis point? 

  3. There is no mention of a negotiation strategy to secure
release of individuals at the crisis point. 

  4. There is no mention of any attempt to negotiate at all. 

  5. SAC Salt Lake is requested to consider negotiation strategy
and advise FBIHQ. 

  Coulson informed Glenn that Headquarters was "not prepared to
approve the plan as submitted." 

  The 6:30 p.m. entry on the SICC log reads: 

  SAC Glenn advised DAD Coulson that Portland SWAT team had
contact with who (sic) they believed was subject approximately
1/4 mile "up canyon" from home. He used profanity and told the
to get off property. SAC WAS REMINDED OF RULES OF ENGAGEMENT AND
TO TREAT SUBJECT AS THREAT IF CONFRONTED OUTSIDE HOME. SAC IS
WORKING ON NEGOTIATION PLAN. [FN572] 

  Coulson told this investigation that the entry refers to the
Rules of Engagement that he and Potts had formulated. WE found
no other entry in the SIOC log or situation reports approving
either the operational plan as a whole or the Rules of
Engagement set forth by Glenn. [FN573] 

  Gore believed the tactical plan included incremental increases
of tactical pressure on the subjects, to be effected only if the
Weavers failed to enter into negotiations. Gore told us that FBI
Headquarters refused to approve the operations plan because a
negotiation strategy was not part of it. [FN574] 

  When the operations plan was rejected, Frederick Lanceley, the
FBI chief negotiator, was asked to write a negotiation addendum.
Before this, Lanceley had played no role in developing an
operations plan. He had attended Rogers' 9:00 a.m. briefing of
the sniper/observers and heard Rogers tell the group that there
would be "no long siege" and that the "Rules of Engagement" were
to shoot armed adult males, if there was a clear shot. After
attending this briefing, Lanceley concluded that a tactical
solution would be sought without negotiations. [FN575] While en
route to the crisis site, Lanceley told Rogers that he would
work with HRT Intelligence because there was not going to be a
negotiation effort. When Rogers said, "Good," Lanceley felt that
his impression had been confirmed. Consequently, Lanceley did
not participate in the planning on Saturday, August 22, until he
was told in early afternoon that Headquarters had rejected the
operations plan because a negotiation effort had not been
included. [FN575] 

  Lanceley wrote the follow-up negotiation addendum to the
operations plan. This addendum provided: 

  Crisis Negotiation Annex To Ops Plan 

  A negotiator wll [sic] go forward to the residence in the APC
[Armored Personnel Carrier]. When the APC is in view of the
house, it will stop and the negotiator will make the following
statement: 

  'Mr. Weaver, This is Fred Lanceley of the FBI. You should
understand that we have warrants for the arrest of yourself and
Mr. Harris. I would like you to accept a telephone so that we
can talk and work out how you will come out of the house without
further violence. I would like you or one of your children to
come out of the house, unarmed, pick up the telephone and return
to the house.' 

  At the conclusion of this statement, the APC will proceed
forward, drop the hostage phone and withdraw. If Weaver or a
child retrieves the telephone, the negotiator will attempt to
initiate a dialogue. [FN577] 

  This addendum was sent to FBI headquarters and received the
following response: 

  FBIHQ agrees with negotiation annex as submitted. Salt Lake
should Proceed with this negotiation plan on his [sic] own
initiative. [FN578] 

  Eugene Glenn, in a signed sworn statement given to the FBI
team [FN579] that reviewed the shooting incident following the
resolution of the crisis stated that, "[o]n August 22, 1992, at
12:30 p.m. PDT, FBI Headquarters approved the operations plan
which included ... Rules of Engagement." Glenn is the only
person who has stated that an operations plan was ever approved. 

  [GARRITY] [FN580] 

  In a statement given during this inquiry, Glenn recalled that,
although FBI Headquarters did not approve the proposed
operations plan, Potts told him that the Rules of Engagement had
been approved as formulated and could be put into effect. Glenn
told Rogers about this approval. [FN581] 

  The Rules of Engagement remained in effect until they were
replaced by the FBI standard deadly force policy on August 26,
1992. Although Rogers testified that the operations plan was
modified in the ensuing days and submitted to FBI Headquarters,
he stated that it was never approved and never implemented. fn
582 The only written operations plan provided to this
investigation, the prosecutors, and defense counsel is dated
August 23, 1992. 

  c. Interpretation of rules of Engagement by Law Enforcement
Personnel 

  both Assistant Director Larry Potts and former Deputy
Assistant Director Danny O. Coulson have stated that the Rules
of Engagement were merely a means of identifying the level of
risk presented by the situation and were not intended to change
or modify the FBI's Standard Deadly Force Policy. Potts
explained: 

  These ROE [Rules of Engagement] were established to assist the
HRT personnel in making a determination regarding what
constituted a threat to them in this extraordinary circumstance. 
The ROE were not intended to supercede [sic] the FBI standard
deadly force policy. The final determination regarding such
implementation of deadly force must always remain with the
individual faced with the actual choice, and each individual
must make an individual, final determination of threat.... I was
acutely aware that HRT personnel could encounter armed subjects,
and as a result of the events leading to and resulting in DUSM
Degan's death, it was my intention to ensure that HRT personnel
in the area of the crisis were fully aware of a heightened
degree of threat. [FN583] 

  Similarly, in Coulson's view, the Rules of Engagement: 

  were never intended to change or modify the FBI's Deadly Force
Policy. They were intended to heighten the sense of awareness to
the dangers presented to our personnel. I have personally issued
Rules of Engagement on numerous occasions, both in real life
tactical situations and in training exercises. They do not take
away the judgment factor of those who implement them, nor do
they change established FBI policy. [FN584] 

  Special Agent in Charge, Eugene Glenn, believed that the Rules
of Engagement were "within the Bureau's standard deadly force
policy, but that they [were] an expansion of that policy."
[FN585] He explained that during the initial stages of the
standoff: 

  [W]e were completely unable to communicate with the individuals
in the Weaver compound, we had no current intelligence
information as to the nature of the tactical preparations they
were making to engage law enforcement personnel, and I wanted to
make sure that the Agents who were moving into close proximity
to the compound were clearly aware that they had been given MORE
LATITUDE regarding their application of deadly force, if
necessary, to ensure maximum safety of law enforcement officers
approaching the compound. [FN586] 

  Glenn intended the Rules of Engagement to decrease the
reaction time in which deadly force is normally initiated by a
FBI special agent. In Glenn's words: 

  I believed that this heightened level of awareness (reflected
in the Rules of Engagement) was absolutely essential to preclude
further death or serious injury to law enforcement personnel
responding to this crisis. By issuing these Rules of 
Engagement, I was indicating to all tactical personnel the
serious nature of this situation and the necessity that they be
ready to immediately employ deadly force, should it be
appropriate. [FN587] 

  With regard to the phrase "can and should," Glenn intended
this language to indicate clearly to all tactical personnel that
they were fully authorized to utilize deadly force against the
Weaver/Harris group if appropriate. He did not intend to remove
the individual agent's responsibility to determine whether
deadly force was necessary, but simply to advise personnel that
action by individuals within the Weaver compound that
jeopardized law enforcement personnel could be addressed with
deadly force to prevent additional law enforcement casualties. 
Glenn stated that, although the Rules of Engagement were not a
"license to kill, " as some have alleged, they probably put HRT
personnel in a more "offensive mode." [FN588] 

  This investigation also discovered several different
interpretations of the terms "adult" and "adult male," as
contained in the Rules of Engagement. Glenn told us he intended
that these terms apply only to Randy Weaver, Kevin Harris, Vicki
Weaver (as appropriate), and sympathizers who entered the Weaver
compound to prevent law enforcement officers from resolving the
crisis. [FN589] As is more fully explained below, other law
enforcement officials who were questioned about the Rules stated
that only Randy Weaver, Kevin Harris, and Vicki Weaver were
included in the category "adult" while adult sympathizers would
fall under the standard FBI deadly force policy. 

  The FBI Special Agent in Charge, William Gore, believed that
the Rules of Engagement seemed appropriate to the situation at
Ruby Ridge. He understood that the Rules made any adult male
with a weapon in the Weaver compound the object of deadly force. 
It was clear to him that Harris and Weaver were the adult males
specified by these Rules. He understood that Vicki Weaver was
excluded from the pre-announcement Rule because there was no
probable cause to believe that she posed a deadly threat to law
enforcement. However, before an announcement to surrender had
been given, Gore believed that "any armed adult [who] emerged 
from the cabin... would be displaying clear disregard for the
lawful demand to lay down arms and surrender." [FN590] 

  Gore understood the Rules of Engagement as a "broadening of
the FBI's deadly force policy ... based upon these specific
subject having demonstrated their willingness to kill a Federal
official to avoid capture." [FN591] Gore believed Rogers and
Smith had formulated the Rules during their trip to Idaho and
that they had been approved by FBI Assistant Director Potts. 

  Supervisory Special Agent John G. Sauls, Legal Instruction
Unit at the FBI Academy, noted that the nonspecific character of
the terms "adult" and "adult male" made the Rules of Engagement
too broad for the FBI's standard deadly force policy, unless HRT
had also been given instructions as to who fell into these
categories. He also found the word "should" inappropriate
inasmuch as the final determination as to whether to use deadly
force must be made by the agent. He added, however, that, with
appropriate additional information simultaneously provided, the
Rules could be brought within the requirements. [FN592] 

  John C. Hall, also a Supervisory Special Agent with the Legal
Instruction Unit at the FBI Academy, was similarly critical of
the Rules of Engagement. In an "informal analysis" that was not
an official opinion of the FBI's Legal Counsel division, he
concluded that the portion of the Rules stating that deadly
force could and should be used against any armed adult male
before the surrender announcement could be misread to direct
agents to use deadly force without first giving the subjects an
opportunity to surrender. He raised the possibility that the
Rules could have been misread to permit the use of force beyond
that which is permitted by the Constitution or FBI policy. Hall
was adamant, however, that, despite the language of the Rules,
the decision of HRT sniper/observer Lon Horiuchi to use deadly
force on August 22, did not violate either the Constitution or
FBI policy. [FN593] 

  Assistant U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist, one of the two
prosecutors in the federal case against Randy Weaver and Kevin
Harris, asserted that he had "struggled" with the Rules of
Engagement. He asked Lon Horiuchi during trial preparation
whether the HRT sniper/observers interpreted the word "should"
to mean that they must shoot, if they saw an adult male with a
weapon in the compound area. [FN594] According to Lindquist,
Horiuchi said that he retained a great deal of discretion and
that he and the other HRT members approached the situation
according to the FBI's standard policy on the use of deadly
force. [FN595] 

  Frederick Lanceley, the FBI Hostage Negotiator, who
participated in the negotiations with the Weaver/Harris group,
was surprised and shocked by the Rules of Engagement. The Rules
were the most severe he had ever seen in the approximately 300
hostage situations in which he had been involved. He
characterized the Rules as inconsistent with the FBI standard
policy on the use of deadly force. [FN596] 

  HRT Commander Richard Rogers acknowledged that neither he nor
any member of the HRT during his tenure had ever operated under
Rules of Engagement such as those employed during the Ruby Ridge
crisis. [FN597] He testified that under the standard FBI policy
on the use of deadly force the FBI "ask[s] our agents for more-- 
we're asking that they wait a little longer to ensure that these
individuals basically are going to employ some kind of deadly
force against them." [FN598] At Ruby Ridge, he said, "we already
know that the subject -- in this case, the males from the Weaver
compound -- had already employed deadly force against the law
enforcement officers, so they had clearly crossed that threshold
in killing an officer already." [FN599] Rogers explained that
the Ruby Ridge Rules told the HRT sniper/observers that they
could wait a little less before employing deadly force.
According to Rogers, the determination of how long to wait is
left to the individual's discretion. [FN600] 

  By the phrase, "can and should," Rogers meant that the
sniper/observers had the authority to utilize deadly force and
should utilize it, if an opportunity presented itself. The Rules
did not refer to the agents' judgment because judgment "is
understood by every FBI agent, and clearly understood by every
member of HRT.... [T]hey should use deadly force in order to
protect themselves or other individuals." [FN601] He testified
that he did not explain his understanding of the phrase "can and
should" to the HRT snipers because: 

  [T]hey understood what I was talking about... [and] I trained
with them every day, and we discussed -- I mean, an FBI agent,
from the time he goes through training at Quantico, has the
standard rules of engagement drilled into his head.... I also
have a sign with the standard FBI rules printed on it, hanging
in the classroom at the hostage rescue team. [FN602] 

  HRT supervisor, Stephen McGavin, drafted the Rules of
Engagement based on his understanding of the Rules as described
by Rogers. He believed that the Rules were restrictive, as well 
as cautionary. according to McGavin, the Rules address the
application of deadly force in terms of the identity of the
subjects and impose certain age and gender restrictions. McGavin
believed that the Rules of Engagement were intended to alert the
HRT members to the extreme danger they faced and to inform them
that they might or would probably encounter circumstances which
might call for the use of deadly force. According to McGavin,
regardless of the Rules' restrictive or expansive character,
they were not intended to replace the FBI's deadly force policy.
[FN603] 

  McGavin explained that in the Ruby Ridge crisis, the
perception of deadly threat, coupled with the fact that Weaver
and Harris had demonstrated a willingness to kill a federal
official, produced grave concern that HRT members needed to be
made aware of the extreme danger. According to McGavin,
individuals react differently in perceiving threatening action
and deciding whether deadly force is necessary. He reasoned that
the failure to react or a delayed reaction to a threat in an
extremely dangerous situation could have deadly consequences for
the individual confronted with the threat or for another team
member who might be unaware of the threat. Thus, the Rules of
Engagement "used in this cries" were designed to give the HRT a
clear idea and understanding when a shot could or could not be
taken. [FN604] 

  Rogers told McGavin to insert the phrase "and should" into the
Rules. [FN605] McGavin viewed the "can and should" terminology
not as an order to shoot, but as a reminder that the lives of
the sniper/observers and the lives of perhaps many more of their
numbers might depend upon reacting quickly to the danger known
to exist on the mountain. According to McGavin, "Deadly force
'should' be employed against a dangerous individual who poses a
deadly or grievous bodily threat. The determination that it 
'must' be employed is the sole responsibility of the person who
perceives the threat and acts on that perception." [FN606] 

  According to McGavin, "The 'any adult males' terminology in
the second Rule of Engagement which applied to the time period
before the surrender announcement, excluded Vicki Weaver from
coverage because of uncertainty about her involvement in the
shootout with the [Deputy marshals on August 21]." [FN607]
McGavin explained that the qualifier, "'any' reflects our lack
of information about the crisis site, and addresses the
possibility that we could encounter Weaver supporters in the
compound." McGavin believed that the supporters would have to
display further actions of a threatening nature to be subjects
of deadly force." [FN608] 

  The HRT sniper/observers saw the Rules as not merely
heightening their sense of danger, but as modifying the usual
deadly force policy. For example, Dale Monroe interpreted the
Rules as a "green light" to use deadly force against armed adult
males. [FN609] Edward Wenger believed that, if he observed armed
adults, he could use deadly force, but standard FBI shooting
policy was to be applied to all others at the cabin. [FN610] 

  Another sniper/observer, Warren Bamford, recalled that an
arrest team was to be sent to the cabin to demand that Weaver
and Harris surrender, but, under the Rules of Engagement, deadly
force could be used against armed, adult males outside the cabin
before the team arrived. Bamford found the Rules "not consistent
with the Standard FBI Deadly Force policy, in that the obvious
and imminent threat of death or grievous bodily harm had been
predetermined," but he believed that the threat was severe
enough to warrant such Rules. [FN611] 

  Mark Tilton remembered: 

  As a part of the briefing, we were also given the rules of
engagement which set forth the conditions under which we are
authorized to utilize our weapons. These rules were reiterated
in detail by SA Lester Hazen, Sniper coordinator, prior to our
tactical deployment. We were told that the FBI's standard policy
concerning the use of deadly force applied in this situation and
that there were additional special rules of engagement WHICH
WOULD APPLY IN THIS SITUATION. (EMPHASIS ADDED.) [FN612] 

  Similarly, Jerome Barker stated that, "[1]s part of the
briefing given by Les Hazen, we were told that there were
special rules of engagement WHICH WE WERE TO ABIDE BY."
(Emphasis added.) [FN613] 

  Among the FBI SWAT teams deployed to the RUBY Ridge site,
there was a wide variety of interpretations of the Rules of
Engagement. Denver SWAT team leader Gregory Sexton recalled the
Rules as, "[i]f you see Weaver or Harris outside with a weapon,
you've got the green light." He had never seen such severe Rules
of Engagement, and he believed that they were inappropriate
because briefings about the subjects, Degan's death, and
observation of the terrain would be sufficient to alert tactical
personnel to the dramatically increased danger without
superseding standard deadly force policy. [FN614] 

  Another member of the Denver SWAT team characterized the Rules
as "strong" and as a departure from the FBI's standard deadly
force policy. [FN615] A third member of Denver SWAT, who was
briefed on the Rules by the Denver SWAT team leaders, remembered
the Rules of Engagement as "if you see 'em, shoot 'em." this
agent had never been given such Rules of Engagement before, and
he felt that they were inappropriate. He said other SWAT team
members were taken aback by the Rules and that most of them
clung to the FBI's standard deadly force policy. [FN616] A
fourth Denver SWAT team member's reaction to the Rules at the
time was, "[y]ou've gotta be kidding." He viewed the Rules as an
imperative without clarification and inconsistent with the FBI's
standard deadly force policy. [FN617] 

  One of the members of the Marshals Service SOG, who was
deployed to provide rear protection for the HRT personnel, was
briefed in the HRT tent by the FBI on the Rules of Engagement.
Although he did not disagree with the Rules because "they had
drawn first blood," he would have been "full of questions about
the Rules," had been in a position to take a shot. [FN618] 

  Most significant is the testimony of Lon Horiuchi, the
sniper/observer who eventually fired at members of the
Weaver/Harris group. Horiuchi conceded that the Rules were
different from those in the FBI manual and the Rules under which
the HRT usually operated. He had never before been asked to
operate under such Rules, which differed from the standard
deadly force policy in that "the decision that we were already
in danger had already been made for us prior to going on the
hill." [FN619] Horiuchi testified that this was the first time
he had been asked to apply Rules that differed from the standard
deadly force policy. Under the latter, he could not shoot a
person, unless that person posed a threat to his or another
person's safety, and the decision as to whether a person posed a
threat was left to Horiuchi. Under the new Rules, the decision
that there was a threat had already been made. [FN620] Horiuchi
acknowledged that, under the Rules, he could and should shoot 
any adult male, if he had an opportunity. [FN621] 

  The following exchange during cross-examination summarizes
Horiuchi's perception of the Rules: 

  Q: Were you advised that the folks there had a habit of coming
out of the house with the weapons? 

  A: Yes sir, I believe that was one of the briefings. 

  Q: So you knew that sometimes they came out, the dogs barked,
they came out with their weapons, you knew that, didn't you? 

  A: Yes, sir. 

  Q: Under your rules of engagement, you could then and should,
if they came out of the house, you could and should use deadly
force? 

  A: Yes, sir, it is true. [FN622] 

  d. Deployment of FBI HRT, SWAT and U.S. Marshals Service SOG
Personnel at Ruby Ridge. 

  On Saturday, August 22, 1992, at approximately 11:0 or 11:30
a.m. (PDT), FBI Special Agent Lester Hazen, the HRT sniper
coordinator, ordered Lon Horiuchi, the HRT "Blue"
sniper/observer team leader, to prepare his team for deployment.
He also ordered Roger Love, the "Gold" sniper/observer team
leader, to have his personnel assist in setting up the HRT's
Tactical Operations Center (TOC). [FN623] The teams were told 
that an armored personnel carrier would be sent to the Weaver 
cabin to announce that the occupants should surrender. An HRT
assault team would be inside the carrier to effect the arrest, 
if the subjects complied. The teams were instructed to establish 
positions so that they could provide observation and long range 
precision fire in accordance with the Rules of Engagement. 
According to HRT Commander Rogers, the sniper/observers knew 
that a surrender announcement was part of the plan, but: 

  [G.J.] [FN624] 

  [G.J.] [FN625] 

  Before the Rules of Engagement were given to the teams,
McGavin, second in command of the HRT, brought the typed Rules
to Rogers at the command trailer. When Rogers returned later
with word that they had been approved by FBI Headquarters, the
HRT and U.S. Marshals Service SOG sniper/observers were briefed
on the Rules of Engagement. [FN626] [GARRITY] [FN627] Marshals
Service SOG personnel were deployed behind the HRT personnel to
protect the HRT sniper/observers from hostile action from the 
rear. SOG Deputy Commander Stagg told his sniper/observers to 
take orders from Hazen. [FN629] 

  The sniper/observers were deployed to the mountainside
overlooking the Weaver cabin to provide security for tactical
units, which, after the sniper/observers were in position, would
form an inner perimeter around the Weaver compound. The
sniper/observers were also deployed to be used to safeguard law
enforcement officers attempting to establish communications with
the cabin. Additionally, they were to be used to gather
information about the terrain, armaments, and fortifications,
along with information about those present at the crisis site. 
[FN630] 

  Hazen asked U.S. Deputy Marshal Ron Libby, who was familiar
with the area, to identify observation positions and routes for
HRT personnel to travel to those locations. The rough terrain
made 4-wheel-drive vehicles necessary for transporting the HRT
members; Hazen attempted to obtain these vehicles. [FN631] 

  After waiting several hours for the 4-wheel-drive vehicles, 
HRT Command decided, at approximately 3:00 p.m. (PDT), [FN632]
to send the sniper/observer teams to their positions on foot. 
After briefing the teams on the Rules of Engagement, Hazen
dispatched nine HRT sniper/observers in four groups. One
"overwatch" group of two HRT sniper/observers was held back to
wait for the vehicles. 

  The sniper/observers took several hours to work their way up
the mountain to the observation posts. At 3:45 p.m. (PDT),
during a reconnaissance flight, someone in the HRT helicopter
warned the sniper/observers by radio of movement outside the
Weaver cabin and in the compound area. The sniper/observer group
halted until it was reported that the individuals had returned
to the cabin. the group then continued up the hill. [FN633] 

  e. Use of the Helicopter 

  HRT helicopter pilot, Frank Costanza, flew six reconnaissance
missions on August 22, 1992, from the staging area at the
command post to an area above and around the hilltop where the
Weaver cabin was located. He believed that the purpose of the
flights was to afford FBI, Marshals Service, and U.S. Attorney's
Office personnel the opportunity to assess the area and the
terrain around the Weaver residence. Costanza tried to avoid
hostile fire during the flights by remaining at least 200 yards
away from the cabin. He described the weather conditions as a
mixture of rain and snow and noted that visibility was limited.
[FN634] 

  According to Glenn, the helicopter was used to fly over the
area to identify possible sites for the sniper/observer teams.
Aerial operations were severely hampered by inclement weather.
The low cloud ceiling made it impossible to operate the
helicopters out of range of the weapons thought to be in the
Weaver cabin. Accordingly, the helicopters were utilized at low
altitudes, and they weaved "around the crisis site . . . to
avoid being an obvious target." Glenn took one flight that was
within range of a rifle shot, but the helicopter never flew
directly over the Weaver cabin. [FN635] 

  A member of the Marshals Service SOG reported that, while he
was at the command post area on Saturday, August 22, he saw the
helicopter fly toward the cabin and return very quickly. He
heard that the Weavers had come out of the cabin and had acted
in a hostile manner toward the helicopter but that they had not
fired at the helicopter. [FN636] 

  f. Placement of HRT Sniper/Observers in Area Surrounding the
Weaver Cabin 

  Because of the rugged terrain and deteriorating weather
conditions, HRT sniper/observers began arriving at positions on
the ridge overlooking the Weaver cabin approximately two to two
and one half hours after setting out from the command
post/staging area. [FN637] 

  At 5:07 p.m., the HRT sniper/observer team designated as
Sierra 4, of "S-4," arrived at its position. this team consisted
of Lon Horiuchi and Dale Monroe. At 5:20 p.m., the HRT team
designated Sierra 2, consisting of Edward Wenger and Warren
Bamford, arrived at its position. At 5:52 p.m., Sierra 3,
consisting of Jerome Barker and Christopher Curran, arrived at
its position. Between 5:52 p.m. and 5:57 p.m., S-1, consisting
of HRT members Christopher Whitcomb, Roger Love, and Mark
Tilton, arrived at its position. [FN638] 

  Horiuchi's "Sierra 4" position was the closest of the four
positions, almost due north of the cabin in a line almost
parallel to the front wall. He was at a slight angle above the
cabin, approximately 646 feet from the front door and
approximately 579 feet from the outbuilding known as the
"birthing shed." There was a ravine between Horiuchi and the
cabin. [FN639] Horiuchi could see the top of the front porch of
the cabin and straight through the porch. He could see the front
of the door as it opened and when it was in an open position. 
Horiuchi could not see the front door when it was closed, nor
could he see into the cabin. He could also see the deck at the
back of the cabin. [FN640] 

  g. Circumstances Involving the Two Rifle Shots Taken by HRT
Member Lon Horiuchi. 

  (1) The First Shot 

  At approximately 5:45 p.m., Horiuchi saw an unarmed, young
female, slight of build, with a ponytail, run from the front of
the Weaver cabin toward a rocky outcropping. 

  [G.J.] [FN641] 

  [GARRITY] 

  [FN642] 

  After viewing this female with the naked eye, Horiuchi
observed her through his rifle scope and determined that she was
a child. Although he could have fired at her, he did not because
"the female was not armed at that time and [he] was assuming she
was a child because of the size of the stature." [FN643]
Horiuchi could not recall whether the front door was open when
the child was outside the cabin, but after she returned to the
cabin, the door was closed. [FN644] 

  Within a minute after the girl returned to the cabin, Horiuchi
observed an unarmed male on the back deck. The man moved to the
back corner of the deck where ponchos or blankets were hanging
on a string. "It seemed like he just felt them to see if they
were dry and then he went back in." [FN645] The man was in
Horiuchi's vision for perhaps ten seconds, an, although Horiuchi
could have both fired and hit the person, he did not because
"the individual did not appear to be armed, there was nothing in
his hand, and I did not see any weapons around or on his
person." [FN646] HRT sniper.observer Whitcomb, from his Sierra-1
position, the highest and farthest away from the Weaver cabin of
the four positions, could vaguely observe this individual on the
back porch. [FN647] The other HRT sniper/observers did not
report that they saw a man on the back porch. 

  At 5:57 p.m., the HRT helicopter took off for its sixth
observation mission of the day. HRT Commander Rogers, Marshals
Service Deputy Director Smith, Marshals Service SOG Commander
Haynes, and HRT pilot Frank Costanza were aboard. [FN649] Haynes
observed someone outside the cabin, but he could not identify
the person or see whether the person was armed. [FN650] Rogers 
and Smith recall that someone aboard the helicopter reported 
seeing two persons outside the cabin, armed with rifles,
although none of the other people in the helicopter recalls
observing anyone outside the cabin. About the time the
helicopter landed, Costanza recalls hearing radio reports that
two shots had been fired. [FN652] 

  Horiuchi heard the helicopter and the armored personnel
carriers start their engines, and he saw the helicopter take off
from the command post to the left of the Weaver cabin, circle to
his left and out of his sight. [FN653] Within five to ten
seconds after the helicopter engine started, Horiuchi saw two
males and the female he had seen earlier come out of the front
door of the cabin and run toward the "rocky outcropping" a
defensive position near the front of the cabin. [FN654] [G.J.] 

  [G.J.] [FN655] 

  [G.J.] [FN656] 

  [FN657] 

  Horiuchi saw the three people run behind the "birthing shed,"
a wooden building close to the cabin and disappear from his
view. Horiuchi focused on the person he believed to be Harris
because he was carrying a "shoulder weapon" at "port arms."
[FN658] [G.J.] 

 [FN659] and because the person was not making and threatening 
movement, [FN660] 

  [G.J.] [FN661] 

  Jerome Barker at the Sierra 3 position saw two adult males and
one adult female, carrying "long barreled weapons," move from
the cabin toward the birthing shed. [FN662] He perceived their
movements as rapid, evasive, and indicative of a 
confrontational posture. [FN663] He lost sight of the second 
male who exited the cabin, and he saw the other male and the 
female move toward his position and the Sierra 4 position. He 
lost sight of these people as they entered a ravine, less than 
two hundred yards from Barker's position. Barker prepared to 
"encounter" the two individuals whom he considered a threat. 
[FN664] 

  Horiuchi continued to concentrate on the person who had rounded
the rear corner of the birthing shed. As he came back into view,
Horiuchi believed that the man was the armed individual he had
initially seen running from the cabin. [FN665] The man picked 
up a stick and appeared to be poking at the ground and looking
up above and to the right of Horiuchi where Horiuchi sensed that
the helicopter was flying. [FN666] 

  [GARRITY] 

  [FN667] 

  When the person reappeared at the side of the shed from which
he had disappeared, he held his weapon at high port and scanned
above and behind Horiuchi's position. He seemed to be looking
for the helicopter. The person was "watching the helicopter, and
at times he would kind of bring his weapon up and [Horiuchi]
perceiv[ed] that perhaps he was trying to get a shot off."
[FN668] 

 [FN669] [GARRITY] Horiuchi fired one shot, just as the man 
suddenly moved along the side of the birthing shed out of sight. 

  When Horiuchi shot, the man was at the corner of the shed,
with his back toward Horiuchi. 

  [GARRITY] 

 [FN670] Horiuchi "assumed that he was raising [his arm] to grab
inside the building to spin himself around the corner." [FN671]
Horiuchi acknowledged that when he shot he was aiming at the
man's back. [FN672] 

  Horiuchi assumed that he had hit the man or the edge of the
birthing shed. [FN673] After he fired, the person "continued to
move around the corner of the birthing shed, so -- without any
effect, it didn't seem like he was hit at all, so that's why my
assumption was that I had missed." [FN674] 

  Horiuchi assumed that the person at whom he had fired was
Kevin Harris. [FN675] In fact, Horiuchi shot Randy Reaver. After 
the first shot, Horiuchi decided that he would shoot at this
person again, if he got the opportunity. [FN676] 

  Harris has said that he, Randy Weaver, and Sara Weaver left
the cabin with rifles and that he went to the rocks near the
cabin to retrieve a battery, while Randy and Sara Weaver went to
the birthing shed to see Sammy Weaver's body. After hearing a
shot, Harris ran to the birthing shed where Weaver exclaimed,
"I'm shot." [FN677] 

  Randy Weaver stated: 

  Kevin, Sara and I (Randy) left the house to check the North
perimeter. We didn't see anything so I (R) was going into the
guest shed where Sam was to see him one last time. As I (R)
reached up to unlatch the door I was shot from the rear and hit
in the upper right arm." [FN678] 

  (2) The Second Shot 

  According to Horiuchi, after ten to twenty seconds, the man he
thought he had initially shot at came back into his view, joined
by the other male and the female. Horiuchi observed the male and
female run toward the cabin trailed by nine steps by the man
Horiuchi thought had been the target of his first shot. 

  The first two people disappeared behind the open door, and,
Horiuchi assumed, went inside the cabin. Horiuchi had determined
after the first shot that he "was going to shoot at that
individual again" because: 

  I believed he was the same individual that had attempted to
shoot . . . at the helicopter, and therefore, I assumed that he
was moving back to the house to get a more protected location
inside the house and I didn't want him back in the house. . . .
[K]nowing that the children were inside the house, that would
have been my last opportunity to shoot him before he got into
the house because I probably would not have shot at anyone
inside the house for fear of shooting the children. . . . [H]e
would have been more protected inside the house and he could
have shot at either me or my fellow agents or the helicopter
still flying around at that location, probably knowing that we
couldn't shoot back in there without harming some of the
children. [FN679] 

  Horiuchi fired as Harris approached the porch. Harris was
reaching out with his left hand toward the door and taking a
last step to the doorway, appearing to be holding the door open
or moving someone out of the way. 

  [GARRITY] 

  [FN680] 

  Horiuchi was leading the running target, that is, aiming
slightly in front of him as he ran, so that the target subject
would, in effect, run into the bullet. The cross hairs of the
rifle's scope were on the edge of the door or just on the wood
portion of the door. [FN681] The door was fully open, and
Horiuchi could see the entire front face of the door, except for
the bottom portion. At the time of the shot, the target had his
weapon in his right hand and was reaching out with his left
hand. [FN682] 

  Horiuchi saw the individual flinch as if he had been hit and
disappear into the doorway. The man reached like he had been
"punched" or hit on the side; he fell behind the door. [FN683]
Afterwards, Horiuchi heard a female scream for about 30
seconds. [FN684] He assumed that the female was screaming 
because Harris had been hit. [FN685] In fact, Vicki Weaver had
been fatally shot. 

  Horiuchi assumed that the individuals preceding the person at
whom he shot had gone inside the cabin. He has testified that he
did not see anyone standing behind the door when he shot and
that he did not intend to shoot Vicki Weaver. [FN686] 

  [GARRITY] 

  [FN687] 

  Horiuchi's report of the events and their sequence is
compatible with the reports of the other sniper/observers on the
scene. [FN688] 

  At the base command post, HRT sniper coordinator Hazen heard a
radio report of "shots fired," followed soon thereafter by a
report that "two friendly shots [had been] taken." He recalls
transmissions about "armed subjects with long guns,"
"screaming," and a "possible hit." [FN689] The HRT "Sniper Log" 
reports at 6:01 p.m.: "Shots fired, screaming." Various other
logs contain similar information and more confused accounts of
the events. [FN690] 

  Harris has given a statement about the events of August 22. 
After the first shot, Harris says, he, Randy Weaver, and Sara
Weaver ran to the cabin. Vicki Weaver held the door open while
Randy Weaver entered first, followed by Sara. When Harris was
almost at the doorway, at a point parallel with Vicki Weaver, he
heard a shot, which penetrated the door window and hit Vicki
Weaver in the head and Harris in the left arm and chest.[FN691] 

  Randy Weaver has reported that he was turning the latch on
the birthing shed door when he was shot. When Vicki Weaver
exited the cabin, Randy Weaver told her that he had been shot. 
Vicki Weaver then turned, told the children to go inside, and
was putting the "babies" inside when she was shot. Randy Weaver
said that Vicki Weaver was holding the baby when she was
shot.[FN 692] None of the sniper/observers heard a baby cry
during or immediately after the shooting incident. 

 h. Initial Surrender Announcement 

  Following the shots, the helicopter landed at the command
post. HRT Commander Rogers ran to the Tactical Operations
Center and received confirmation that Horiuchi had fired.[FN693] 

  Rogers and FBI Special Agent in Charge Eugene Glenn agreed
to deploy the armored personnel carriers to establish
communications with the Weaver cabin. [FN694] 

  The hostage telephone, telephone wire, and other necessary
equipment were on the carriers. At approximately 6:15 p.m., the
two carriers were driven to the cabin area with only visual
contact between them because the agents had been unsuccessful in
establishing radio communication. On the way up the mountain
the armored personnel carriers encountered an obstruction on the
road. While this initially caused great concern, it was
ultimately determined that the obstruction was not a booby
trap.[FN695] 

  Once they arrived at the cabin are, Frederick Lanceley, the
FBI senior hostage negotiator, gave the prearranged surrender
announcement. He told the cabin's occupants about the arrest
warrants for Weaver and Harris and asked Weaver to accept the
telephone so that negotiations for his surrender could proceed.
[FN696] The announcement followed the script contained in the
negotiations annex to the operations plan that Lanceley had
prepared earlier. There was no response from the cabin. 

  The carriers withdrew, laying telephone line as they
descended the mountain. At 9:45 p.m., the telephone was
operational and five unsuccessful attempts were made to connect
Weaver, with the last made at 11:30 p.m.[FN697] 

 3. Discussion 

 a. FBI Rules of Engagement 

 (1) Factors Considered in the Formulation of the Rules of
Engagement 

  In our view, the information available to FBI supervisors
justified their apprehension and their anticipation of extreme
danger during the initial stages of the FBI response to the
crisis at Ruby Ridge. However, we believe the Rules of
Engagement formulated and implemented at Ruby Ridge were an
extreme response to the perceived threat. 

  HRT Commander Rogers testified that the HRT did not know
for certain that the Weaver/Harris group was inside the cabin
when the snipers were deployed. Nor did he know whether Weaver
knew of the presence of law enforcement or of the withdrawal of
the marshals.[FN698] In crafting the Rules of Engagement,
Rogers had to consider the possibility that the subjects were in
firing position and that they were scattered around the area. 

  Rogers believed that the fact that the marshals had been
rescued and that Degan's body had been taken off the mountain
did not alter the potential danger. He found no evidence that
the mind-set of the people who had killed Degan had changed. 
They had not surrendered or attempted any explanation for the
death, and Rogers had no reason to believe that Degan's death
had been accidental. As far as he knew, the Weaver/Harris group
was prepared to kill other law enforcement officers.[FN699] 

  We believe that it is reasonable to assume that the
occupants of the Weaver cabin expected law enforcement presence
in response to the events of August 21. By the time the snipers
arrived at their positions on August 22, it is inconceivable to
us that the Weavers did not know that they were the focus of an
intense law enforcement effort. Helicopters were circling the
mountain area and sirens could be heard. The Weaver/Harris
group knew that Harris and Sammy Weaver had been in a gun fight
with federal law enforcement officials and that Harris had
severely injured or killed a marshal.[FN700] Indeed, Harris and
Randy Weaver's statements and Vicki Weaver's diary reflect their
knowledge that the gunfight at the "Y" was with law
enforcement.[FN701] In addition, the Weavers had a television
and radio in their cabin and could have received reports about
the incident. 

  However, knowledge of a law enforcement presence is
different, in our opinion, from the specific knowledge that
snipers had surrounded the cabin. We have not discovered any
information establishing that the Weaver Harris group knew that
they were surrounded by HRT snipers. 

 (2) Approval of the Rules of Engagement 

  Before addressing the legality of and the necessity for the
Rules of Engagement, the question of whether the Rules given to
the sniper/observers on August 22, 1992 were ever approved must
be considered. 

  The Rules of Engagement were initially formulated while
Commander Rogers was en route to Idaho. Rogers testified that
FBI Assistant Director Larry Potts approved the Rules of
Engagement during that flight before Rogers landed in Idaho. 
The three people, who discussed the Rules of Engagement that
evening, recall the proposed Rules differently. 

  Potts recalled approving the following Rules: 

  1. [A]ny adult with a weapon who was observed in the
vicinity of Randy Weaver's cabin or the firefight area, could be
the subject of deadly force. 

  2. [A]ll efforts be made to avoid any confrontation with
the children, but if such a confrontation became unavoidable,
that faced with the threat of death or grievous bodily harm, the
standard FBI use of Deadly Force Policy would be in effect. 

 [GARRITY][FN702] 

 [GARRITY] 

 as the on-scene commander, Glenn had the authority to make such
a modification.[FN703] 

  Potts told this inquiry that he did not realize the Rules
had been changed from deadly force "could" be employed to deadly
force ~"can and should" be employed until after the crisis was
resolved. However, he believes that "should" does not mean
~"must" and that it only serves to heighten the awareness of the
threatening situation at hand.[FN704] 

  Danny Coulson, Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI at the
time, also recalled the Rules as formulated as using the term
"could" as opposed to "can and should~." He too was unaware that
the proposed operations plan contained Rules of Engagement that
used the term "deadly force can and should be employed.~"[FN705] 

  Glenn, the senior FBI manager at the site and commander of
the effort, had never established Rules of Engagement in spite
of years of experience as a supervisory agent. Although Rogers
presented "proposed" Rules, it appears that Glenn gave great
deference to Rogers' expertise, especially in light of the
Rules' Friday night approval by Potts and Coulson at FBI
Headquarters. 

  A lack of documentation in the FBI files made our review of
the approval of the Rules of Engagement very difficult. For
example, we found no entries in the FBI's SIOC log discussing
the draft Rules of Engagement. There are no notes or records of
Potts' and Coulson's initial approval of the Rules. Moreover,
there is no documented approval thereafter. We find this lack
of documentation significant and serious. The FBI prides itself
on its attention to detail. We find no such attention given
here. As was the case here, failing to preserve or create
records could have serious consequences in future criminal or
civil litigation arising out of similar events. The failure to
record and preserve significant events, meetings, and
discussions should be corrected. 

  On Saturday, August 22, written Rules of Engagement were
approved by Glenn, and sent by facsimile to FBI Headquarters as
part of an operation plan sometime between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m.
(PDT) Glenn approved the written Rules in the morning in their
original form and again in the afternoon, as modified to cover
only armed adult males as subjects of deadly force before a
surrender announcement. That plan was not approved. A
negotiations strategy was requested, and other questions were
addressed to Glenn about the deployment and the crisis site. 
Coulson reviewed the plan up to the point where a negotiation
strategy should have been detailed. Finding none, he decided
not to approve the plan and notified Potts and Glen of his
decision.[FN705] No one at FBI Headquarters claims to have seen
the Rules as written in the proposed plan, and an operation plan
was never approved, although a number of plans were submitted
throughout the siege. 

  Before briefing the sniper/observers on the Rules of
Engagement, Rogers asked Glenn if FBI Headquarters had approved
the Rules. Glenn told Rogers that they had been
authorized.[FN707] In his statement to this review team, Glenn
stated that at approximately 12:15 p.m.: 

  [The] operations plan, which included the ROE, was faxed to
FBIHQ and USMS HQ for review. FBIHQ responded by requesting
that we supply a negotiations option, which was not included in
the plan, prior to approval. However, I was telephonically
advised at that time, I believe by Assistant Director Larry
Potts, that the ROE were approved as formulated and could be
enacted. Based on this approval I informed ASAC Rogers, and the
HRT personnel were briefed on these ROE.[FN708] 

  It is our conclusion that Rogers justifiably believed that
the Rules of Engagement provided to help the HRT and SOG
personnel were fully authorized. On the trip to Idaho, Rogers
had received oral authorization for the use of special Rules
from Potts and Coulson.[FN709] Finally, before the snipers were
briefed on the Rules and deployed, Rogers secured Glenn's
acknowledgement that FBI Headquarters had approved the final
version of the Rules. 

  Although we found no written record reflecting approval of
the Rules of Engagement, Potts acknowledged that he approved a
version of the Rules early in the crisis without the word
"should" and with the understanding that Glenn had authority to
limit the Rules to "adult males" without Potts' approval. The
only mention of the Rules of Engagement in the FBI's SIOC log is
Coulson's reminder to Glenn about the Rules of Engagement in
response to the latter's report that a SWAT team believed that
it had seen Weaver away from the cabin. [FN710] Coulson's
response is evidence that special Rules of Engagement in some
form had been approved by FBI Headquarters. Potts and Coulson
confirm this conclusion. However, since there is not written
record of specifically what version of the Rules that FBI
Headquarters approved, we cannot confidently say that the word
"should" was approved by FBI Headquarters at any time. 
Nevertheless, since those Rules which contained "should"
remained in force at the crisis scene for days after the August
22 shooting, it is inconceivable to us that FBI Headquarters'
remained ignorant of the exact wording of the Rules of
Engagement during that entire period. 

 (3) The FBI Standard Policy on the Use of Deadly Force and the
Constitutionality of the Rules of Engagement 

 The FBI's Standard Deadly Force Policy states that: 

  Agents are not to use deadly force against any person
except as necessary in self-defense or the defense of another,
when they have reason to believe that they or another are in
danger of death or grievous bodily harm. Whenever feasible,
verbal warnings should be given before deadly force is
applied.[FN711] 

  The purpose of the policy is to inform agents of
circumstances when the use of deadly force in the line of duty
is appropriate and to prohibit the use of deadly force in other
circumstances. According to the FBI's training materials, the
policy's importance is its uniformity of instruction,
utilization, and administrative review. Such uniformity
eliminates uncertainty and confusion.[FN712] 

  "Deadly force" is defined in the policy as force likely to
cause death or serious bodily injury. Under FBI policy, deadly 
force is justified, if the subject is likely to cause death or 
serious bodily injury if not controlled and deadly force is 
necessary to achieve control safely. When deadly force is 
permissible, agents are instructed to utilize the amount of
force reasonably necessary to eliminate the threat they face. 
When feasible, verbal warnings should be given before deadly
force is applied, and, when a subject may be granted an
opportunity to surrender without exposing agents or the public
to unreasonable danger, the policy requires that the
opportunity be given. [FN713] 

  The FBI's standard deadly force policy comports with the
constitutional standard enunciated by the U.S. Supreme Court in
Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1 (1985), and Graham v. Connor,
490 U.S. 386 (1989). Garner requires that the officer have
probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of
serious physical harm, either to the officer or others, before
using deadly force to prevent escape. The standards for
objective reasonableness set forth in Graham are considerably
more explicit than those in Garner and also require
consideration of whether the suspect poses an immediate threat
to the safety of the officers or others.[FN714] The
preconditions in the FBI's deadly force policy for the use of
deadly force are essentially the same as those stated in Garner,
that is, that deadly force may be used to protect oneself or
others against death or grievous bodily harm. The FBI's deadly
force policy also includes a provision for giving warnings, when
feasible, as mandated by Garner. 

  We are considerably less sure about the constitutionality
of the Rules of Engagement in effect on August 22, 1992 than we
are about the FBI's standard deadly force policy. The Rules
provided: 

 1. If any adult in the area around the cabin is observed with a
weapon after the surrender announcement had been made, deadly
force could and should be used to neutralize the individual. 

 2. If any adult male is observed with a weapon prior to the
announcement deadly force can and should be employed if the shot
could be taken without endangering any children. 
 3. If compromised by any dog the dog can be taken out. 

 4. Any subjects other than Randy Weaver, Vicki Weaver, Kevin
Harris presenting threat of death or grievous bodily harm FBI
rules of deadly force apply. 

 We believe that these Rules contain serious constitutional
infirmities. First, Garner states that, when feasible, warnings
should be given. However, in paragraph 1 of the Rules, the
giving of warnings apparently releases agents from evaluating
the necessity of using deadly force, that is, from determining
whether the subject "poses a threat of serious physical harm."
Garner at 11. Garner specifically addresses the issue of the
fleeing felon who refuses to surrender and does not sanction the
use of deadly force, unless it is necessary to prevent escape
and the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect
poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury
to the officer or others or that he has committed a crime
involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious
bodily harm. Garner at 11-12. Thus, although paragraph 1 of the
Rules was never employed because Horiuchi used deadly force
before warnings had been given, it falls outside the strictures
of both Garner and Graham, which require that law enforcement
officers evaluate the risk of grievous bodily harm or death to
themselves and or others, before employing deadly force. 

 Paragraph 2 suffers from a similar problem because it does not
provide for evaluation by the agent of whether the armed adult
male poses an immediate threat before employing deadly force
against them. This contradicts the mandate of both Garner and
Graham. 

 Paragraph 4 suffers from a related defect in that it applies
the FBI standard policy on deadly force to all parties, except
Randy Weaver, Vicki Weaver, and Kevin Harris. The FBI drafted
this Rule in that manner because it considered these three
people particularly dangerous, especially because the agents
believed that Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris had killed Deputy
Marshal Degan. However, Garner and Graham do not exempt law
enforcement officers from evaluating risk to themselves and
others, even from persons they deem especially dangerous. The
Constitution allows no person to become "fair game" for deadly
force without law enforcement evaluating the threat that person
poses, even when, a occurred here, the evaluation must be made
in a split second. 

 Finally, the instructions that deadly force "should be used" in
paragraph 1 and that deadly force "should be employed" in
paragraph 2 flatly contradict the commands of Garner and Graham,
which require the careful evaluation of the risk posed by a
suspect before law enforcement can employ deadly force. The word
"should" strongly encourages the use of deadly force. The use of
such language in the Rules was unconstitutional. Despite FBI
protestations to the contrary, these instructions did not merely
heighten the snipers/observers' sense of dangerousness presented
by the situation but went further and sanctioned the use of
deadly force without the evaluation of the actual threat posed
by individuals encountered by the agents on the mountain. We
believe that these Rules of Engagement created an atmosphere in
which the sniper/observers were more likely to employ deadly
force than had the FBI standard deadly force policy been in
effect. 

 In addition to the aforementioned problems, we must conclude
that the Rules of Engagement were defective for three other
reasons. First, they were imprecise. As we have seen from the
accounts of law enforcement personnel who formulated, approved,
and implemented the Rules, there was no uniform interpretation
of them. Some interpreted the Rules as an expansion of the FBI
standard deadly force policy which allowed the sniper/observers
more leeway on when to fire their weapons. However, others
argued that the Rules restricted the standard policy. There was
also disagreement regarding who fell within the coverage of the
Rules and the term "any adult." Furthermore, many were adamant
that the words "can and should" did not create a mandate to
shoot and that the judgment and discretion of the shooter always
prevailed. Most, however, seemed to agree that the Rules served
to heighten the awareness of danger, thereby reducing the time
sniper/observers had to evaluate whether to shoot. 

 The lack of precision and the resultant absence of a common
understanding as to when to employ deadly force are serious
problems. Regardless of whether the Rules of Engagement had an
impact upon Horiuchi's decision to shoot, FBI supervisors at the
Ruby Ridge crisis were responsible for giving precise orders
concerning the use of deadly force by their personnel. In our
view, Rules of Engagement that do not restrict the use of deadly
force should not be implemented without clear authorization
following the careful legal review of the proposed Rules. 

 Our second objection to the Rules relates to the impact the
Rules had upon the HRT during its deployment on August 22. The
Rules seem to have created an atmosphere which Glenn described
as a "more offensive mode." To this extent, we believe the Rules
contributed to Horiuchi's decision to take a second shot.[FN715] 

 Our final objection to the Rules is that they were an
unconstitutional departure from the FBI's standard deadly force
policy. As noted above, the FBI standard policy requires agents
to assess the level of danger before using deadly force and to
give warnings when feasible. The statements of the
sniper/observers, along with Horiuchi's testimony, demonstrate
that the Rules of Engagement did more than merely "heighten the
awareness of the danger level" on the mountain. The Rules
created an atmosphere that eliminated or significantly reduced
the discretion of the agent to assess the nature of the threat,
thereby eliminating the constitutionally required calculation of
the threat level before deadly force is used. 

 Nothing in the recent Supreme Court cases suggests that the
approach adopted in the Rules is unconstitutional. Rather, the
standards enunciated in Garner and Graham emphasize the vital
significance of assessing the "immediate threat of grievous
bodily harm or death to self or others" before law enforcement
officers may use deadly force. However, it is clear from the
sniper/observers' statements that they understood that the Rules
did change and supersede the standard deadly force policy and
that the Rules were to be "abide[d] by."[FN716] Although we
appreciate that evaluations of whether to employ deadly force
may occur in a split-second and should not be judged from the
perspective of hindsight, we must conclude that the Rules in
effect were unconstitutional. The Constitution places the
decision on whether to use deadly force on the individual agent;
the Rules attempted to usurp this responsibility. 
b. Initial Deployment of Law Enforcement Personnel to Ruby
Ridge. 

 The FBI viewed the situation at Ruby Ridge as extremely
dangerous. Potts, the Assistant Director of the Criminal
Investigative Division of the FBI, feared that casualties would
be sustained in the attempt to establish a perimeter at the
crisis site. He characterized the situation at Ruby Ridge as
"the most dangerous situation the HRT has ever gone
into."[FN717] Similarly, Coulson, the Deputy Assistant Director
of the Criminal Investigative Division of the FBI at the same
time, assessed the situation as posing an extreme risk to law
enforcement personnel. In his words, "these types of operations
are the most dangerous type of tactical operations that can be
undertaken, especially if the subjects have not been
contained."[FN718] 

 The first priority of the FBI at Ruby Ridge was to secure and
control a perimeter around the Weaver cabin to ensure the safety
of law enforcement personnel and to prevent the escape of those
who may have been involved in the exchange of gunfire the
previous day. In addition, the FBI wanted to obtain information
about the situation based upon firsthand observation rather than
having to continue to rely upon the reports from other law
enforcement agencies. 

 We agree that the deployment of tactical personnel at Ruby
Ridge to establish a perimeter around the Weaver cabin was a
sound decision. Indeed, a consensus exists among FBI tactical
specialists and other professionals in the law enforcement
community that securing and controlling the site should be the
first priority in a crisis. For these reasons, the initial
strategic step by the FBI to deploy HRT sniper/observers and
members of the Marshals Service SOG around the cabin was
appropriate. 

 Another issue surrounding the initial deployment of law
enforcement personnel was the delay in deployment, which
occurred at least six hours after the HRT arrived at Ruby Ridge.
A substantial portion of the delay resulted from the late
arrival of four-wheel drive vehicles to transport the
sniper/observers to the mountain area surrounding the cabin.
This delay was crucial in that the first team of
sniper/observers did not arrive at its position until
approximately 5:00 p.m. Had the sniper/observers been deployed
without waiting for the vehicles, they could have reached their
positions some three hours earlier. Considering the gravity of
the situation and the urgent need to gather intelligence, the
delay was significant. However, the HRT supervisors explained to
us that because of the rugged mountain terrain, they concluded
that four-wheel drive vehicles were critical to a speedy
deployment. Although in retrospect, it may have been advisable
to deploy on foot, we believe that the decision to wait for the
vehicles was reasonable under the circumstances existing at the
time. 

 A final issue presented during the early development period was
the need for a call out or to give a warning to those in the
cabin before an HRT member fired a shot. Constitutional case law
and the FBI's standard deadly force policy require such an
announcement to be given "when feasible" before deadly force is
used. We find that the management team gave insufficient
consideration to giving such warnings. Although we do not
believe it was appropriate, or safe, for Horiuchi or any of the
other HRT sniper/observers to give a surrender warning to those
in the cabin after they had arrived in their positions,[FN719]
it was of crucial importance that such warnings be given by
others, if feasible. 

 The plan in effect between the deployment of the HRT
sniper/observers and the time of the surrender announcement was
that contained in the Rules of Engagement which instructed HRT
personnel to use deadly force if armed males were seen outside
the cabin. We believe that FBI management team should have
addressed the probability that once the subjects would come out
of the cabin, especially considering the sounds of the
helicopter and personnel carriers that were present during this
time. 

 The first planned warning, assuming the subjects were contained
in the cabin, was the formal announcement which was to occur
after the personnel carriers had arrived in the cabin vicinity.
The lack of a planned "call out" as the sniper/observers
deployed is significant because the Weavers were known to leave
the cabin armed when vehicles or airplanes approached. The
absence of such a plan subjected the Government to charges that
it was setting Weaver up for attack. We believe that the
management team did not satisfy its obligation to evaluate the
feasibility of giving surrender warnings under those
circumstances. The delay in giving the surrender announcement is
discussed in greater detail below. 

 c. The HRT Rifle Shots Fired on August 22, 1992 

  (1) The Applicable Standard for Review 

 The Fourth Amendment provides persons with the right to "be
secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against
unreasonable searches and seizures," and this right extends to
those persons suspected of actual or anticipated criminal
wrongdoing. When police officers arrest a criminal suspect, they
make a seizure, thereby bringing their conduct within the
protection of the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment and the
case law emanating from it provides that, while there are
important governmental interests in effective law enforcement,
there are equally powerful countervailing interests supporting a
person's right to be free from the intrusiveness which
inevitably accompanies a seizure. 

 The U.S. Supreme Court has considered the question of seizures
by the use of deadly force and has articulated a framework with
which to analyze their constitutionality. In Tennessee v.
Garner, 471 U.S. 1,7 (1985), the Court stated that "there can be
no question that apprehension by the use of deadly force is a
seizure subject to the reasonableness requirement of the Fourth
Amendment." When a police officer kills or mortally wounds a
suspect while attempting to make an arrest, the ultimate seizure
occurs. Not only is the suspect deprived of his life, in which
he has the most fundamental interest, but society is deprived of
the "judicial determination of guilt and punishment." Id. at 9.
However, the Supreme Court recognized that effective law
enforcement requires that deadly force be permissible in some
circumstances. 

 In Garner, a burglary suspect fled the crime scene while a
police officer pursued him. Although the officer identified
himself and ordered Garner to stop, Garner continued to scale a
fence. The officer, who saw no weapon and who was reasonably
sure that Garner was unarmed, fired shots that killed Garner.
The state statute permitted an arrest by all necessary means if
the suspect had been provided notice of the officer's intent to
arrest him yet persisted in fleeing or forcibly resisting
arrest. The Supreme Court ruled this statute unconstitutional
because it justified the use of unreasonable force, regardless
of the danger that the suspect presented. 

 The Court in Garner enunciated a general theory permitting the
use of deadly force by police officers: 
[W]here the officer has probably cause to believe that the
suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the
officer or to others, it is not constitutionally unreasonable to
prevent escape by using deadly force. Thus, if the suspect
threatens the officer with a deadly weapon or there is probable
cause to believe that he has committed a crime involving the
infliction or threatened infliction of serious physical harm,
deadly force may be used if necessary to prevent escape, and if,
where feasible, some warning has been given." 
Id. at 11-12. 

 It was not until 1989 in Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, that
the Supreme Court articulated an objective standard for
evaluating the use of deadly force. In Graham, police had
forcibly detained Graham, a diabetic, and prevented him from
drinking orange juice to prevent the onset of insulin shock. The
police handcuffed Graham and ignored or rebuffed his attempts to
explain and treat his condition. Graham sustained multiple
injuries and was released when it was determined that he had
done nothing wrong. 

 The Supreme Court rejected the subjective standard the district
and appellate courts had imposed which had required Graham to
show that the police had applied force "maliciously and
sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm." Id. at 390
-391 (citations omitted). The Court held that instead of a
subjective standard "all claims that law enforcement officers
have used excessive force -- deadly or not -- . . . should be
analyzed under the Fourth Amendment and its `reasonableness'
standard. . . ." Id. at 395. 

 (2) The First Shot 

 With respect to the objective reasonableness of each of
Horiuchi's shots, we must examine them in conjunction with the
factors enunciated by the Graham court -- the severity of the
crime, whether the suspect posed an immediate threat to the
safety of the officers or the others, and whether he actively
resisted arrest. 

 Before assuming their position overlooking the Weaver compound,
Horiuchi and the other agents had been briefed about the
encounter at the Y. From this briefing, they knew that a marshal
had been killed; that Weaver had sophisticated weapons
experience; that the family had declared that they would never
surrender to the federal government and were prepared for a
confrontation with the government; that the family was generally
armed when they left the cabin; and that the family made armed
responses to approaching people and vehicles. Although FBI
personnel did not have specific details about the August 21
shooting, they knew: that more than one shot had been fired at
the "Y"; that Randy Weaver, Kevin Harris, and Sandy Weaver had
been there; and that Kevin Harris had shot and killed Deputy
Marshal Degan. In addition, they had been informed that shots
had been fired at an airplane and that there had been
unconfirmed reports of an April 1992 shooting at a news
helicopter near the Weaver compound. 

 Thus, before Horiuchi was in position to react to the quickly
unfolding events of the evening of August 22, it could be said
that two Graham factors had been satisfied: Horiuchi knew that a
crime had been committed, and he knew that Weaver was resisting
arrest with Harris' assistance. [FN720] 

 With those two factors satisfied, we turn to the remaining
question of whether the person whom Horiuchi shot posed an
immediate threat to officers or others. Before Horiuchi fired
his first shot, he had two opportunities to shoot, first at the
young girl, then at the unarmed man who was prodding the ground
with a stick. Horiuchi did not shoot either person because he
believed the young female was an unarmed child and that the man
was not behaving in a threatening manner. 

 According to Horiuchi, he fired the first shot only after he
heard and saw the helicopter. When the person whom he believed
to be Harris reappeared at the side of the shed from which he
had disappeared, he held his weapon at high port and scanned
above and behind Horiuchi's position. Horiuchi believed that the
man was looking for the helicopter. According to Horiuchi, the
man was "watching the helicopter, and at times he would kind of
bring his weapon up and [Horiuchi perceiv[ed] that perhaps he
was trying to get a shot off." [FN721] 

 The person in Horiuchi's sights moved along the side of the
birthing shed, while holding his weapon high. Horiuchi believed
that the person had seen the helicopter and was trying to get to
the other side of birthing shed. Horiuchi concluded that the
person was preparing to shoot at the helicopter with his scoped
rifle. [FN722] He saw the individual watching the area where
Horiuchi believed the helicopter was flying and saw the man
"getting ready to take a shot at the individuals in the
helicopter." [FN723] 

 [GARRITY] 

 [FN724] Horiuchi "assumed that [the man] was raising [his
arm] to grab inside the building to spin himself around the
corner." [FN725] It was at this time that Horiuchi fired one
shot. At the time that Horiuchi shot, the man was at the corner
of the shed, with his back toward Horiuchi. According to
Horiuchi, he was aiming at the man's back at the time he fired
the shot. [FN726] After the shot was fired, the man suddenly
moved along the side of the birthing shed and disappearing from
Horiuchi's vision. 

 Horiuchi's colleague's, who were able to see the events at the
cabin, gave considerable corroboration for his perceptions. Dale
Monroe, Horiuchi's teammate, heard the helicopter and noticed it
flying around the Weaver cabin. He "thought [the Weaver group
was] going to shoot at the helicopter from various fortified
positions around the cabin. . . ." Although Monroe's view was
obstructed by the brush, he eventually spotted an adult male
with a rifle near the birthing shed just before he heard the
first shot. Monroe assumed that "the immediate danger. . . . was
to the helicopter". [FN727] Jerome Barker saw two males and a
female, all armed with long barreled weapons, move from the
residence to the birthing shed. He believed that they "posed a
grave threat to the safety of the helicopter as well as
[him]self and [HRT members] Curran, Horiuchi and Monroe." Barker
was telling his partner Curran of their location so that Curran
would "be prepared to encounter them at they approached" when he
heard a shot from Horiuchi's position. [FN728] 

 Some of Horiuchi's perceptions as he fired the first shot were
not accurate. At trial, Horiuchi was adamant that he never saw a
gun in the hands of Randy Weaver, even though Weaver was armed
at the time he was struck by Horiuchi's first shot. [FN729] 

 [G.J.], [FN730] Horiuchi was incorrect. Several HRT
sniped/observers on the mountainside and Harris himself confirm
that Sara Weaver, Randy Weaver, and Kevin Harris were all armed
at the time they came out of the cabin. [FN731] 

 Although we are troubled by Horiuchi's inaccurate perception
of some of the facts when we took the first shot, we do not
think that these misperceptions affected his ability to assess
the risk presented. Indeed, we find his perception of the facts
most relevant to our inquiry to be reliable and reasonable. More
specifically we find reliable and reasonable his perceptions
that the target was an armed man; the helicopter was in flight;
and that the movements of the man indicated a threat to the
helicopter. Based on these perceptions, Horiuchi, as well as the
two other snipers, who were able to see the movement around the
cabin, believed that the safety of both the people in the
helicopter and the snipers were threatened by the armed
individuals 

 [G.J.] 

Special Agent in Charge Glenn noted that, on a reconnaissance
mission on which he was a passenger, the helicopter was forced
by bad weather to "stay at low altitudes and weave around the
crisis site in an effort to avoid being an obvious target."
[FN733] Glenn believed that the helicopter was within range of a
rifle shot. [FN734] 


 Weaver and Harris have stated that their actions were innocent
and not indicative of aggressive conduct. According to them,
they left the cabin to view Sammy Weaver's body in the birthing
shed an to retrieve a battery. We are skeptical of this account.
Indeed, we think it is unlikely they would have timed such
innocent activities to coincide with event which would expose
them to enhanced risk by leaving the secure cabin and venturing
to an unprotected area when armed law enforcement personnel were
nearby. Therefore, we find their explanation implausible. We are
convinced that because of their knowledge of and involvement in
the previous day's shooting of a marshal, the heavy traffic
below that was audible in the cabin, and the loud helicopter
flights above the Weaver cabin, that the cabin occupants knew
that law enforcement personnel were in the area. In light of the
circumstances, we believe they probably came out in response to
the noise of the helicopter and the personnel carriers, not
simply for the innocent reasons they offer. Accordingly, we
believe that Horiuchi reasonably interpreted the actions of the
three people as they ran from the cabin as aggressive. 

 The law requires that we give some deference to Horiuchi's
perceptions of the threat to the helicopter and the individuals
aboard it. Indeed, the Supreme Court in Graham cautions that
"the `reasonableness' of a particular use of force must be
judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the
scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight." Graham,
386 U.S., at 396. In Graham the Supreme Court also advised that,
in assessing the reasonableness of the use of deadly force, one
must allow for the fact that police officers are often forced to
make split- second judgments in these circumstances, like those
at Ruby Ridge, that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving.
As the Sixth Circuit emphasized in Smith v. Freland: 

 [W]e must avoid substituting our personal notions of proper
police procedure for the instantaneous decision of the officer
at the scene. We must never allow the theoretical, sanitized
world of our imagination to replace the dangerous and complex
world the policemen face every day. What constitutes
`reasonable' action may seem quite different to one facing a
possible assailant than to someone analyzing the question at
leisure. 

954 F.2d at 347 

 Applying these standards to the first shot taken by Horiuchi,
we conclude that the first shot meets the constitutional
standard of "objective reasonableness". We accept Horiuchi's
justification for the first shot. Based on the circumstances
present at the time, we find it reasonable for Horiuchi to
believe that the armed male he observed was preparing to shoot
down the helicopter. 

 (3) The Second Shot 

 We now look at the immediacy of the threat factor to evaluate
whether the second shot was justified. The second shot, after
passing through the window of the cabin door, killed Vicki
Weaver who was standing behind the door and also seriously
injured Kevin Harris. 

 As a preliminary matter, the two conditions we found satisfied
in regard to the first shot -- the reasonable conclusion that
the suspects had been involved in a severe crime and that they
were actively resisting arrest -- were satisfied at the time of
the second shot. Again, our focus must be on whether the target
of Horiuchi's shot posed an immediate threat to the officers or
others. 

 In our discussion above, we found that when Horiuchi fired the
first shot, he made a judgment of threat and necessity based on
his observation that the armed male posed an immediate threat of
death or serious harm to the occupants of the helicopter.
Horiuchi admitted that, after taking the first shot, he intended
to shoot at that man again, given the opportunity, because the
threat the subject posed would increase after he returned to the
cabin. [FN735] Horiuchi feared that once the man returned to the
cabin, he would have been more protected and could have shot at
the HRT personnel or the helicopter. Horiuchi felt that the man
probably knew that law enforcement personnel "couldn't shoot
back in there without harming some of the children." [FN736] 

 The second shot raises serious questions. On one hand,
Horiuchi believe that at least one subject was armed and had
intended to shoot at the helicopter, and that the subjects now
knew at least generally where a sniper was located. However,
this perception must be evaluated in conjunction with the
reality that the subject were returning to their home and had
not returned fire when shot upon. Thus, their actions as they
ran into the cabin were not aggressive, but rather protective or
defensive. 

 We find Horiuchi's explanation of the threat and necessity of
the second shot speculative. Based on the facts known and the
actions of the subjects, we do not believe it was reasonable to
perceive an immediate threat as they ran back into the cabin.
Once the family was back in the cabin, the potential threat to
the safety of the helicopter and law enforcement personnel was
more remote than when Horiuchi had earlier believed that the
armed male was about to position himself to shoot at the
helicopter. Although we believe Harris and the Weavers knew that
law enforcement personnel were present, no call out or surrender
announcement followed the first shot. The subjects were never
given a chance to drop their arms to show that they did not pose
a threat. The subjects simply did what any person would do under
the circumstances: they ran for cover. 

 Horiuchi also confused his targets. He erroneously believed
that the last man returning the cabin as the man he had
originally tried to shoot. Thus, Horiuchi never saw Harris, the
target of his second shot, take any threatening action toward
the helicopter. 

 Many of the sniper/observers saw three people running to the
cabin after the first shot. None reported ny action that could
immediately be interpreted as threatening to the helicopter or
the sniper/observers. In a statement Horiuchi prepared later
that evening, he explained that, just before Harris entered the
cabin, he "stopped at the door looking for either the helicopter
or where the shot came from. . ." [FN737] Thus, even Horiuchi
does not characterize these movements as threatening or as
provocation for the second shot. Indeed, he admitted that he had
already decided to shoot when Harris paused in front of the
door. Horiuchi testified at trial, " I had already made that
determination after that first shot, so if I saw him again I was
going to shoot at that individual again." [FN738] 

 Although we agree that Harris and the Weavers could have fired
from inside the cabin, we do not believe that this potential,
especially considering the circumstances of the this case,
warranted law enforcement to perceive an immediate threat. Since
the exchange of gunfire at the Y, no one at the cabin had fired
a shot. Indeed, they had not even returned fire in response to
Horiuchi's first shot. Furthermore, at the time of the second
shot, Harris and others outside the cabin were retreating, not
attacking. They were not retreating to an area where they would
present a danger to the public at large or take members of the
public hostage. [FN739] Instead, they were retreating into a
cabin and within rifle shot of well equipped law enforcement
personnel. Finally, as we discussed below, prior to this time,
law enforcement personnel had not viewed the presence of Weaver
and Harris in the cabin as posing a particular threat. In our
view these facts undercut the immediacy of the threat that
Harris posed to Horiuchi and his colleagues. 

 At Ruby Ridge, FBI supervisors in charge of the crisis
determined that, following the deployment of HRT
sniper/observers around the cabin, a negotiation strategy was to
be employed, at least initially, to solve the crisis. [FN740]
The supervisors has decided that the safest solution to the
crisis was to contain the Weaver/ Harris group and induce its
members to leave the cabin through negotiations. This strategy
contemplated that sniper/observers would surround the cabin
while Weaver and Harris were inside with weapons. It can be
assumed that the FBI command contemplated that, during
negotiations, risk form the cabin would be tolerated in the hope
of a peaceful resolution. The plan did not contemplate the use
of deadly force as the only safe alternative. Indeed, plans to
assault the cabin because of a perceived immediate threat had
been rejected earlier in the day. Horiuchi's explanation of the
threat is, therefore, contrary to the approved negotiation
strategy. 

 However, even if Horiuchi's judgment on the necessity to use
deadly force was supportable, we believe that his second shot
was taken without regard for the safety of others near Harris.
Although Horiuchi could not see behind the front door of the
cabin, he had reason to believe that someone might be on the
other side when he took his second shot. At trial he testified
that it appeared that Harris "was trying to hold the door open
or moving somebody out of the way" when Horiuchi fired. [FN741]
When asked if he "knew there was somebody behind the door,"
Horiuchi responded that he "wasn't shooting at the individual
behind the door." [FN742] However, by fixing his cross hairs on
the door, when he believed someone was behind it , he placed the
children and Vicki Weaver at risk, in violation of even the
special Rules of Engagement: 

 If any adult male is observed with a weapon prior to the 
announcement deadly force can and should be employed if the
shot could be taken without endangering any children. (Emphasis
added.) 

 (GARRITY) 
In our opinion he needlessly and unjustifiably endangered the
persons whom he thought might be behind the door. [FN743] 

 (GARRITY) 

  [FN744]. We also find no evidence that Vicki Weaver was
the intended target of the second shot as has been alleged.
Horiuchi testified that he did not intend to shoot her. [FN745]
Our review of the evidence has produce nothing to discredit
those statements. 

 In sum, even giving deference to Horiuchi's judgment, we do
not find that the second shot was based on a reasonable fear of
"an immediate threat to the safety of officers or others."
Moreover, we believe that the shot was unnecessarily dangerous
and should not have been taken. 

 We understand that the FBI standard policy on the use of
deadly force has been interpreted as permitting deadly force
when it is "necessary," that is, "when alternative steps are not
likely to lead to safe control of the subject." [FN746] Some in
the FBI interpret "safe control" to mean "in custody." [FN747]
We are not convinced the this interpretation is sound policy and
point out that the interpretation could allowably argue the use
of deadly force whenever a dangerous person refuses to
surrender, even is less violent measures could be used to
apprehend the person. Such an approach raises serious
constitutional concern. 

 Supervisory Special Agents John Hall and Kimberly Crawford of
the Legal Training Unit at the FBI prepared a legal analysis of
the Ruby Ridge incident and determined that Horiuchi's shots
were "reasonable under constitutional standards" [FN748]. The
Hall/ Crawford analysis concludes that Horiuchi "has a
reasonable basis for believing that the two armed, male suspects
at whom he fired his rifle met the constitutional criteria for
dangerousness" and the both shots were necessary, that is, "no
safe alternatives were available to accomplish the seizure" of
Harris and Weaver. [FN749] In particular, they concluded that
the second shot was necessary to because "permitting a
demonstrably dangerous (and armed) person to regain a position
of cover and concealment dramatically increases the potential
threat to effect the seizures of the suspects." [FN750] 

 Hall and Crawford quote Garner for the proposition that deadly
force is justified in preventing the escape of a suspect, "if
the suspect threatens an officer with a weapon" or" there is
probably cause to believe that [the suspect] has committed a
crime involving the infliction of serious physical harm."
[FN751] They conclude that because Horiuchi reasonably believed
that his targets had "`committed a crime involving the
infliction of serious physical harm' [to Deputy Marshal Degan],
it was reasonable to believe that `the [targets] pose[d] a
threat of serious physical harm'" to Horiuchi and his
colleagues. Finally, the conclude that "[t]he Fourth Amendment
does not require a showing that the threat was `imminent.'"
[FN752] 

 We reject this analysis to the extent that it implies that a
reasonable belief that a suspect has committed a crime involving
the infliction of serious physical harm eliminates the necessity
of considering whether a threat is imminent before deadly force
is used. The Hall/Crawford analysis accurately quotes Garner as
saying `deadly force may be sued to prevent escape", if "the
suspect threatens the officer with a weapon or there is probable
cause to believe that he has committed a crime involving the
infliction. . . .of serious physical harm." [FN753] However,
this language was not intended to indicate that deadly force,
without something more, could be used. Indeed, the following
language in Garner was meant to explicate the previous sentence:
"Where that officer has probable cause to believe that the
person poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the
officer or to others, it is not constitutionally unreasonable to
prevent escape using deadly force." [FN754] Thus, the use of
deadly force in such situations still requires that the officer
have "probable cause to believe" that the person "poses a threat
of serious physical harm." Such a requirement is consistent with
the explicit holding of Garner announced earlier in the decision
that deadly force "may not be used unless it is necessary to
prevent [an] escape and the officer has probably cause to
believe the subject poses a significant threat of death or
serious physical harm." [FN755] Finally, the immediate threat
requirement is reiterated in the Supreme Court in its conclusion
that the "proper application" of the Fourth Amendment to the use
of deadly force requires "careful attention to a number of
factors, which include not only "the severity of the crime at
issue," but also "whether the subject poses an immediate
threat." [FN756] 

 We conclude that, even if Horiuchi reasonably believed that
Weaver and Harris had participated in Degan's killing, he still
had to consider the imminence of the threat his targets posed to
himself and his colleagues when he fired. Considering the
totality of the circumstances of the second shot, we have
concluded that the retreating subjects did not pose an imminent
threat of physical harm. 

 We cannot fault Horiuchi alone for these actions. We are
persuaded that his judgment to shoot at the armed man again, if
given the chance, was influenced by the special Rules of
Engagement, which he had no role in creating but which he was
instructed to follow. We believe that Horiuchi fired his second
shot and Wenger prepared to shoot because the Rules of
Engagement had a significant effect on the snipers/observers'
sense of danger and had encouraged their use of deadly force.
[FN757] 

 Although we believe that, even under the special Rules,
Horiuchi should not have taken a shot into the door with the
possibility that persons other than the other than the target
could be injured, the responsibility for taking that shot may
not rest exclusively with Horiuchi. As we noted above, the
special Rules of Engagement were subjected to different
interpretations as to who was a subject and what conduct could
be required before a shot could be taken. This inquiry finds
that the Ruled expanded the use of deadly force beyond the scope
of the Constitution and beyond the FBI's own standard deadly
force policy. Despite this conclusion, we are convinced that
those who prepared the Ruled believed that their provision were
within the law. 

 Having made these finding, we have proposed recommendations at
the conclusion of this report. However, because we remain
seriously troubled by the circumstances that surrounded the
second shot, we recommend referral of the matter of the second
shot to the appropriate component of the Department of Justice
for a determination of whether federal criminal prosecutive
merit exists. 

 (4) Use of the Helicopter to Draw Subjects Out of the Cabin 

 This inquiry found no evidence to support the allegation that
the FBI intentionally used the helicopter to lure the Weavers
and Harris out of the cabin so that they would be a target for
HRT snipers. Utilization of overhead observation to collect
information at a crisis site and to determine the possible
presence of confederates or individuals in areas adjacent to the
crisis site is a well recognized technique that gathers critical
information for those responsible for responding to crisis
situations. 

 Notwithstanding this conclusion, we believe the FBI
supervision of sniper/observers on the mountain was handled
poorly. From information received at the Marshals Service, FBI
management had reason to believe that the Weaver/ Harris group
would respond to a helicopter in the vicinity of the cabin by
coming outside with firearms. Notwithstanding this knowledge,
they placed sniper/observers on the adjacent mountainside with
instructions that they could and should shoot armed members of
the group, if they came out of the cabin. Their use of
helicopter near the cabin invited an accusation that the
helicopter was intentionally used to draw the Weaver group out
of the cabin. 

 When asked it the helicopter could have been utilized to draw
the Weaver subjects out of the cabin, HRT and SOG personnel were
unanimous that such a tactic would not be sound strategy in that
it would subject those in the helicopter to severe risk. We
agree that the intentional use of a helicopter in such a fashion
would be unwise. In view of the fact that three senior law
enforcement officials were in the helicopter when Horiuchi fired
the first shot, it is unlikely that the helicopter was used
intentionally as a lure. 

 However, we do believe that greater thought should have been
given to the fact that Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris probably
would come out of the cabin when the helicopter flew in the
vicinity. We believe that the deployment of sniper/observers
with the instructions that they "can and should" use deadly
force against armed males outside the cabin, concurrent with the
use of the helicopter, set the stage for the rifle shots on
August 22. By not anticipating the consequences of snipers in
position and helicopter in flight while special rules of
engagement were in force, the FBI invited an accusation of an
intentional lure. Other than rumors, we found no evidence to
support allegations of the helicopter's use in such a fashion. 

 (5) Surrender Announcement 

 In examining the early stages of HRT's involvement in the
crisis, the question of the timing of surrender announcement
arises, namely, whether before or during the deployment of HRT
personnel, the FBI could have announced to those in the Weaver
cabin area the presence of law enforcement and could have
demanded their surrender. 

 When a crisis presents a heightened possibility that federal
law enforcement may employ deadly force, those who have created
the crisis situation should be notified, when feasible, that law
enforcement personnel are in the area and that they should
surrender. Indeed, the standard deadly force policy of the FBI
requires that the agents issue a warning, when feasible, before
deadly force is employed. 

 At Ruby Ridge, it was of paramount importance to give notice
to those in the Weaver cabin at the earliest feasible
opportunity, given the Rules of Engagement in effect during the
initial stages of the FBI operation. The FBI had a good reason
to believe that the people in the cabin had a least a general
knowledge of law enforcement's presence. [FN758] It is less
certain whether they were aware of the imminent danger of being
shot when they left the cabin before Horiuchi fired. [FN759] 

 There was no attempt by the FBI to give notice to the
individuals in the cabin prior to the shots taken by Horiuchi.
However, immediately after the shots, at approximately 6:15
p.m., two armored personnel carriers were driven to the vicinity
of the cabin and a surrender announcement was made. In our view,
the factor that caused the FBI to make the surrender
announcement at that time was Horiuchi's shots. 

 The Rules of Engagement underscore the importance of the
timing of the surrender announcement and make inexcusable and
unjustifiable delay in giving the announcement. The announcement
should have been a priority at Ruby Ridge, not a rushed
afterthought. The FBI should have explored whether it was
possible to make a surrender announcement before deploying
sniper/observers. We believe it was possible to make an
announcement earlier. Perhaps the announcement could have been
made without great risk by using an armored personnel carrier or
a sound transmitter from a safe distance. At a minimum, we
believe that more consideration should have been given to this
crucial part of the operation, particularly in light of the
Rules of Engagement in effect. 

 4. Conclusion 

 We find that the decision to deploy the FBI's HRT and
components of the U.S. Marshals Service SOG to the Ruby Ridge
site was proper. However, the Rules of Engagement drafted by the
FBI were improper and failed to comply with constitutional
standards regarding the use of deadly force by a law enforcement
officer. The Rules were also a departure from the FBI's standard
policy on the use of deadly force. Implementation of such Rules
may have created an atmosphere that caused an HRT
sniper/observer to take a shot that he otherwise would not have
taken. The imprecision of the Rules resulted in wide
misunderstandings regarding the authorized use of deadly force
by law enforcement personnel. In addition, the Constitution
requires that surrender announcements be given, where feasible,
before deadly force may be employed. For this reason, we believe
that the FBI should have given a higher priority to making a
surrender announcement at the earliest possible opportunity. 

 We believe that in examining the "totality of the
circumstances" surrounding the first shot taken by the
sniper/observer, the shot met the constitutional standard of
"objective reasonableness." Applying the same analysis, we
believe, that the second shot did not meet that standard.
Although we did not believe that the existence of an immediate
threat is a precondition for the legitimate use of deadly force,
we do believe that its presence or absence is important. In this
case, we conclude that the sniper/observer did not have a
reasonable fear of an immediate threat to the safety of law
enforcement personnel or others when he fired the second shot.
We find that the circumstances which justified the first shot
were significantly changed by the time the second shot was
taken. There had been no return of fire or further threatening
action, there had been no surrender announcement, and most
significantly, the targets were retreating into the cabin. In
addition, we note that the sniper/observer's perception that the
armed adults' return to the cabin would create an enhanced
danger was inconsistent with the FBI plan in effect which was to
attempt negotiation with the occupants of the cabin. As a result
of these changed circumstances, we conclude that the second shot
violated the Constitution. We recommend that the circumstances
surrounding the second shot be reviewed by the appropriate
component of the Department of Justice for prosecutive merit.

Coulson reminded Rogers of a 1988 HRT deployment in Utah, which
had resulted in the only killing of a law enforcement officer
during an HRT operation. Coulson believed that the Utah
incident was strikingly similar to the Weaver crisis. According 
to Coulson, in the Utah case, BATF had requested the FBI to assist
in apprehending Adam Swapp who had been implicated in the
bombing of a Mormon temple. Like Randy Weaver, Swapp was a
survivalist who armed himself, his associates, and family
members. The HRT was deployed to assist the Salt Lake City
Division in apprehending Swapp. Thereafter, a standoff occurred
during which Swapp and other adults routinely left their
residence while armed. Throughout the siege, Swapp and others
threatened law enforcement personnel, fired upon the perimeter
of the FBI agents, and resisted arrest. At the end of the
siege, a young boy, who was confined to a wheelchair, shot and
killed a local police officer from a window of the house as HRT
members and other law enforcement personnel attempted to
apprehend Swapp. Coulson and Rogers discussed at length the
circumstances of the 1988 case, and Coulson expressed concern
that the HRT would incur casualties if adequate precautions were
not taken at Ruby ridge. ID. at 4-5.

 ROE are utilized as a method of assisting tactical personnel in

policy. When HRT deploys, the initial mission is to isolate and

be employed to neutralize the individual. If any adult male is
observed with a weapon prior to the announcement, deadly force
can and should be employed, if the shot can be taken without
endangering the children.' Although I personally would not
normally, and did not use the word 'should' in that context, it
is my belief that it only serves to heighten the awareness of
the threatening situation at hand, and does not mean 'must'.

     590 Gore explained: 

  In addition to the willingness to shoot a law enforcement
officer as shown by the killing of DUSM Degan, the ROE [Rules of
Engagement] were predicated on the totality of the intelligence
information as provided up to that time, again primarily by the
USMS. Weaver had been reported to have a large cache of weapons.
It had been initially reported he was a Green Beret during his
military service and that he had opportunity for 18 months to
fortify his compound during the extended fugitive investigation
by the USMS. I was also aware that newspaper articles had been
written suggesting that Weaver would not be taken alive. It was
also remarked that he would not come down from the hill.... This
intelligence, at times, also included that he possibly possessed
infrared equipment, explosives, hand grenades and had placed
booby traps.

to inform HRT members going into a continuing crisis between the
government and these subjects, that they were moving in under
great risk, and that an individual in that compound with a
weapon was already a deadly threat. I am not saying that a
decision to shoot would be made for anyone, nor am I saying that

to approach the cabin were arrested by the Idaho State Police. 
On Tuesday, August 25, 1992, five men were arrested after their
vehicle was stopped five miles south of the crisis site in
Naples, Idaho. The previous day, one of these men had purchased
large quantities of ammunition at a local gun shop and had asked
for directions to the Weaver cabin. Seven firearms, including
two Mini 14 assault rifles, and large quantities of ammunition,
were seized from their vehicle.

obstructed by foliage, but he had focused his scope on armed
people running toward the cabin. At the time of the second
shot, an adult male dove toward the front door. Monroe could
not tell if the male had been hit. Monroe Sworn Statement, 
August 31, 1992, at 8. 

  Approximately 30 seconds after the first shot, Wenger was
three people running toward the cabin with a female in the lead. 
The female and male entered the cabin. The second male stopped
on the porch and appeared to look in the direction from which he
had come. While Wenger was lining up a shot, he saw the
individual flinch before dropping below the vision of his scope. 
He heard unintelligible female screaming for approximately ten
to twenty seconds, but did not see a female. Wenger Sworn
Statement, August 31, 1992, at 4. 

  Whitcomb saw three people running toward the cabin. When
they reached the front porch, he heard a second shot. The porch
roof obstructed his view, and he was nothing more. While the
people were outside, Whitcomb attempted to shoot, but was unable
to do so because of obstructions and the speed with which they
moved. Whitcomb Sworn Statement, December 7, 1993, at 7. 

  Tilton saw three persons running toward the cabin and out
of his view. He heard a second shot, followed by a woman
screaming. Tilton Sworn Statement, August 31, 1992, at 3.

whether they were male and female, and could not determine
whether they were carrying weapons. After he lost sight of
them, he heard a second shot. Bamford Sworn Statement, August
31, 1992, at 3. 

  Approximately 15 to 20 seconds after the first shot,
Barker saw three persons moving from the shed to the cabin. One
of the males appeared to be holding his left side. As the three

FBI helicopter, flying over subject's house, had
drawn fire from within the house.  Thereafter,
shots were exchanged between subject(s) in house
and snipers.  None of our personnel were struck.
Unknown if subjects(s) were hit.

	The Crisis Center Log reports between 8:58 p.m. (EDT) and
9:43 p.m. (EDT) :

 two friendly sniper rounds fired into the Weaver 
house, and reported a possible hit.

SIOC [FBI] advised that observation helicopter 
overflying the Weaver residence had take fire 
from the Weaver house.  Ground observers had 
also taken fire when snipers returned fire.

ADO Smith had telephonically confirmed that the 
observation helicopter had taken fire during a
fly over of the Weaver residence.  Law
Enforcement officers at the point fired twice,
possibly hitting one unidentified male, possibly
Kevin Harris.....

and killed.  This information is very sketchy at
this time and its reliability is unknown.

Harris) and two females and exited the Weaver

property.  SAC was reminded of rules of engagement and to treat
subject as threat if confronted outside home.  SAC is working on

be found below.

     716 Barker Sworn Statement, August 31, 1992, at 2.  After
reviewing the statements and testimony of the sniper/observers and
Horiuchi, we have concluded the Horiuchi's decision not to shoot
the two armed males on sight is probably a testament to his
training, given the Rules on which he had been brief at least three
times that day.  Those Rules directed him to dispense with the
usual assessment of harm, to dispense with warnings, even if
feasible, and to shoot armed males who emerged from the cabin.

     717 Potts Sworn Statement, December 17, 1993, at 7.

     718 Coulson Sworn Statement, November 3, 1993, at 6.

     719 A primary function of sniper/observers is to remain
undetected.  Consequently, an announcement by sniper/observers once
in position would, in our view, unwisely disclose their position. 
Horiuchi acknowledge at trial that he could have stood up and told
Weaver and Harris to drop their weapons.  However, he also
testified that "yelling may not have been effective" and that he
"didn't have the time or the distance or probably the voice loud
enough to yell at either Weaver or Harris to drop the weapon." 
Horiuchi Trial Testimony, June 3, 1993, at 169

     720 We believe Harris' behavior indicates that he was
resisting arrest.  After engaging in the firefight that killed
Degan, Harris retreated with Weaver to the cabin and emerged only
when armed.  There was no indication that Harris or any member of
the Weaver/ Harris group was going to surrender to law enforcement.

under the standard FBI deadly force policy.  Horiuchi explained
that the subjects had been aggressive and that, if they got back to
the house, Horiuchi and his colleagues would be exposed to fire
without being able to fire back because of the children in the
cabin.  Lindquist Interview, December 2, 1993, Tape 6, at 21-22.

was not  the only person disposed to shoot again.  As Wenger
watched three people running to the cabin, he "began to line up a
shot with [his] sniper rifle. . . ." Wenger Sworn Statement, August

     743 Ironically, Horiuchi's decision to shoot at the door is
inconsistent with the justification he gave for the shot.  Horiuchi
testified that, once the subjects were in the cabin, the would be
able to fire out and be protected from return fire because the HRT
"probably would not have shot at anyone inside the house for fear
of shooting the children."  Horiuchi Trial Testimony, June 3, 1993,

     745 Id. at 140.

     746 John Hall and Kimberly Crawford, Supervisory Special
Agents at the Legal Training Unit at the FBI Academy, have
concluded that Horiuchi's second shot was necessary because
"permitting a demonstrably dangerous (and armed) person to regain
a position of cover and concealment dramatically increases the
potential threat to future efforts to effect the seizures of the
suspects."  Therefore, in their view, Horiuchi reasonably concluded
that the armed men at whom he fired were likely to cause death or
serious bodily injury, if not controlled, and that the use of
deadly force was necessary to achieve control safely.  Hall/
Crawford Memo, December 2, 1993, at 5.

     757 We note that, having given several sworn statements on the
topic, Horiuchi and HRT Commander Rogers declined to make a
statement to us during the course of this inquiry.

     758 For instance, Glenn concluded that those in the cabin
"were continuing to resist arrest, knowing that law enforcement
personnel were amassing around them because of the large number of
vehicle they would have seen/heard coming up the road in the valley
on a Friday night." Glenn Sworn Statement, January 12, 1994, at 14.

     On Saturday morning, August 22, before HRT's arrival, the
Portland SWAT team leader heard someone he believed to be Randy
Weaver yell words to the effect of "Get the hell off my property." 
The FBI believed that Weaver knew he was addressing law enforcement
officials.  FD-302 Interview of Paul Hudson, October 5, 1993, at 3;
Sworn Statement of E. Michael Kahoe, December 7, 1993, at 6. 
Furthermore, the helicopter mission occurring at the time Horiuchi
took the two shots was the sixth reconnaissance mission by the HRT
helicopter that day.

     759 Gerald McLamb, one of the non-government negotiators who
helped resolve the crisis, said that Randy Weaver did not mention
whether he knew that law enforcement personnel were posted around
the Weaver cabin when he left the cabin to go to the birthing shed.

IV. SPECIFIC ISSUES INVESTIGATED 

  I. FBI Crime Scene Investigation 

   1. Introduction 

  The investigation of the events at Ruby Ridge from August
21-August 31, 1992, included several searches and attempts to
gather evidence. There were three primary crime scenes and
search areas. The first crime scene was at the intersection of
two old logging roads known as the "Y"; the second was the
weaver cabin; and the third was the area around the cabin,
including out buildings such as the birthing shed. During the
searches of the crime scenes, a wide variety of objects was
retrieved for use as evidence in the Weaver prosecution. 

  This section will address various allegations of errors,
omissions, and misconduct relating to the crime scene searches. 
There have been allegations that the measurements taken during
the searches were inaccurate; that the FBI staged or planted
evidence; that the personnel, techniques, and equipment employed
in the searches were inadequate because they lacked the
requisite competence or technical efficiency; that third parties
were allowed to infect the crime scene to cover up the
government's wrongful conduct; and that the integrity of the
crime scenes was not maintained. 

   2. Statement of Facts 

   a. Background 

  The FBI conducted searches of the Y area on August 24,
August 27-31 and September 1, 1992. The FBI supervised searches
of the Weaver cabin, grounds, and outbuildings on August 31 and
September 1 and September 10, 1992. An additional search of the
Y and the Weaver cabin and grounds was conducted on March 22 and
March 23, 1993. The search teams consisted primarily of FBI
personnel from the Salt Lake City and Seattle Divisions and the
FBI Laboratory, augmented by personnel from the U.S. Marshals
Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, tobacco and Firearms, the Idaho
Bureau of Investigation, and the Boundary County Sheriff's
Office. 

  Special Agent in Charge Eugene Glenn maintained overall
control and authorized all investigative activities relating to
the crime scenes and evidentiary matters. T. Michael Dillon,
Senior Supervisory Resident Agent of the FBI's Boise office, had
overall supervisory responsibilities over the FBI's searches of
the 'Y' and the Weaver cabin, grounds and outbuildings and acted
as the search supervisor at the Weaver cabin. 

  Two FBI special agents were assigned significant roles in
carrying out the crime scene searches. Joseph Venkus was
responsible for developing procedures and instructions for the 
searches and establishing a chain of custody for seized
evidence. He was also responsible for organizing the search
teams and handing out assignments. Venkus directed the initial
search of the Y and acted in various capacities during the
search of the Weaver cabin. Gregory Rampton was responsible
for coordinating interviews of the marshals involved in the
shooting incident at the Y on August 21 and for preparing
affidavits for search warrants. Rampton also acted as a team
leader during the search of the Weaver cabin. 

  Other FBI agents played significant roles in the crime
scene investigation. Special Agent Larry Wages was assigned
search responsibilities during the initial search of the Y and
directed the later searches of the Y. Wages also participated
in the search of the grounds surrounding the Weaver cabin. 
Special Agent George Sinclair was team leader for the exterior
search of the grounds and outbuildings near the Weaver cabin. 

  The Strategic Information and Operations Center Log
("SIOC") at FBI Headquarters asserts that a specialized Evidence
Response Team was available as early as August 22 to conduct and 
coordinate the retrieval of evidence at the Ruby Ridge crime
scene. [FN914] Glenn was not aware that the Evidence Response
Team was available, but he state that he would not have used the
team in any case because he saw Ruby Ridge as a 'normal murder
crime scene" and believed that the complexity of the crime scene
would not become an issue. [FN915] 

  On March 22-23, 1993, another search of the Y area was
conducted, although there were between six inches and two feet
of snow on the ground. Assistant U.S. Attorney Lindquist,
Rampton, Boundary County Idaho Deputy Sheriffs, and several U.S.
Deputy Marshal were present, as well as two individual Lindquist
had retained: Lucien Haag, a criminologist who was
reconstructing the August 21 shooting at the Y and Richard
Graham, a retired FBI agent who specialized in the use of metal
detectors. [FN916] The partial butt plate of Sammy Weaver's
weapon was discovered using Graham's metal detector. [FN917] 

   b. Method of Searching the Y Crime Scene 

  During the crisis, seven searches of the Y crime scene were
conducted on August 24 and August 27-31, and September 1, 1992. 
Aside from the September search, the searches were conducted
while the situation at Ruby Ridge was unresolved. Because
Weaver and Harris were still in the cabin farther up the
mountain, FBI supervisors were concerned about the security of
the personnel who would conduct the searches. The Marshals
Service and FBI SWAT teams provided security for those who
conducted the crime scene searches, and the marshals first mad
certain that there were no booby traps or unauthorized persons
in the area. [FN918] 

  The Weaver cabin could be reached in two ways: by a dirt
road, which the weavers generally used, and by two old logging
roads that formed the Y below the cabin. During the crisis and
until the surrender of the Weaver group, the road beneath the
cabin was considered too dangerous; the road through the Y crime
scene was determined to be the safer way for access to HRT
Command Post personnel and monitoring sites. Therefore, during
the crisis, HRT Command Post personnel and equipment used the
road that passed through the Y crime scene. 

  On Sunday, August 23, Dillon conducted a two-hour meeting
with the agents who ere to participate in the searches. [FN919] 
Venkus presented a detailed organizational plan and organized
tow separate search teams to search the Y and the Weaver cabin.
[FN920] Dillon arranged to obtain metal detectors to use during
the searches. [FN921] 

  For the Y crime scene search of August 24, Venkus developed
an operational plan, providing specific assignments for
spotters, a lead agent to collect evidence, a photographer, a
video camera operator, and someone to sketch the crime scene and
note the location of evidence. The Marshal Service, at Dillon's
request, established a perimeter and provided security during
the searches at the Y through September 1. [FN922] 

  Venkus' operational plan included instructions establishing
a chain of custody for evidence, governing the search and the
recovery, documentation, and security of evidence found. Venkus
established a tree stump as the reference point for making
measurements to establish and memorialize the location of
evidence. In order to find any evidence, he instructed a line
of agents, on each side of the road at arm's length, to proceed
across the crime scene. [FN923] 

  The area around the Y was very dense, and searches were
difficult. Agents had to rake through three to six inches of
leaves and branches to locate cartridge casings and other pieces
of evidence. FBI agents and representatives of the Boundary
County Sheriff's Office used metal detectors to locate evidence.
[FN924] 

  As evidence was located, an index card or small flag was
placed where the evidence was found. Venkus would observe the
distance from the reference point to the spot where the evidence
was found. The measurement would be recorded on the crime scene
sketch that Thundercloud prepared. Evidence was photographed
and assigned a letter designation. [FN925] Venkus retrieved the 
evidence and placed it in a plastic evidence bag with an index 
card noting the letter and number designation of the evidence. 
After the search was completed, Dillon held a meeting with the 
participants to discuss what they found. [FN926] 

  Special Agent Larry Wages was placed in charge of crime
scene searches at the Y as of August 28, 1992. Venkus and
Dillon instructed him to follow the procedure that Venkus had
established for searches. Dillon continued to hold meetings
before and after each search to ensure that all participants
understood their assignments and to discuss what had been found.
[FN927] 

  Wages cordoned off the Y crime scene into approximately 10-
foot grids for the August 28 search. For each grid, Wages
assigned a team of two agents, one to operate a metal detector
and the other to act as a spotter. After completing the search
of a grid, the team would repeat the process. The procedures
Venkus established for the chain of custody of the evidence were
followed, including the sighting, documentation, and recovery of
evidence. At the conclusion of the search, Wages turned over
all the evidence found to Venkus for storage and submission to
the FBI Laboratory. [FN928] 

  Later, under Rampton's direction, the fern field was
searched with metal detectors for spent rounds or markings in
the area where the marshals reported receiving gunfire form
trees overhead. No rounds or markings were discovered. [FN929] 

  Commencing on August 28, the five marshals, who
participated in the events surrounding the shooting of Deputy
Marshal Degan at the Y on August 21, were taken on individual
walk-throughs of the crime scene so that the investigating
agents could obtain a clearer understanding of the shooting
location and the chain of events. 

  During the FBI supervised searches of the Y area and the
vicinity of the Weaver residence, the location of evidence was
noted in relation to fixed reference point and in relation to
the other objects of evidence found. [FN930] As evidence was
locate, Agent Thundercloud made a sketch or diagram of the
location of the objects in relation to the fixed point. The
sketch was made by hand and was not drawn to scale. [FN931] 

    (1) Triangulation Not Utilized 

  Triangulation is a technique commonly used to memorialize
the location of evidence discovered at crime scenes by measuring
the location from two fixed reference points to ensure that the
exact location of the evidence is pinpointed. Triangulation was
not utilized during the recovery of evidence at Ruby Ridge. The
FBI's failure to triangulate was harshly criticized by the other
members of the trial team and by the defense at trial. 

  The FBI's primary explanation for not using triangulation
was that the uneven terrain made it impractical. Venkus
believed that triangulation was not only impractical in this
case, it was "ludicrous." [FN932] One of the other explanations
given by the FBI for its failure to triangulate is that
Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen may have told Wages that
triangulation was not necessary and that he should "just get a
compass direction and distance from the tree trunk." [FN933] 
Howen does not recall discussing triangulation, but does recall
discussing the possibility of locating evidence through compass
headings. [FN934] Assistant U.S. Attorney Lindquist believes
that triangulation should be used at crime scene investigations,
unless there is a clear reason not to do so. [FN935] 

   (2) The "Magic" Bullet 

  During the search of the Y crime scene on August 31, the
FBI photographer Kelly Kramer was not available at the start of
the search to take photographs of the evidence located and to
assign letter designations to it. Furthermore, agents
discovered that some of the flags marking the location of
evidence had been walked on or moved as vehicles went through
the area. [FN936] 

  Considerable interest has been generated about an intact
bullet Wages discovered at the center of the Y during this
search. This bullet was designated "L-1" and was referred to by
defense counsel as the "magic bullet." Wages could not
understand why the bullet had not been discovered during the
previous searches. The bullet was not "pristine"; it had been
fired from a weapon and had a dent and striations on it. Later,
it was determined that the bullet had been fired from one of the
Ruger weapons found in the Weaver cabin after the Weaver/Harris
group surrendered. [FN937] 

  Wages recalled that he had FBI Supervisory Special Agent
James Cadigan from the FBI Laboratory photograph the bullet. 
Later Wages realized that he needed to obtain a letter
designation from the photographer and then have a new picture
taken with the letter designation. [FN938] However, Wages was
not able to find a photographer. Thereafter, Wages was
instructed to end the search and return to the command post for
a briefing. The photographer, Kelly Kramer, was still
unavailable to assign letter designations to the bullet and to
photograph them. before leaving the Y area, wages picked up the
L-1 bullet, marked it, and placed it in a plastic envelope that
he put in his pocket. 

  After assisting in the search of the Weaver cabin, Wages
asked Special Agent Kramer to return with him to where the
bullet had been found. Kramer was told to photograph the spot.
[FN939] According to Wages, he did not tell case agent Rampton
that he had removed the bullet from the scene and replaced it
until Rampton asked about it in October or November 1992.
[FN940] 

   c. Investigation by the FBI's Shooting Incident
Review Test 

  On August 31, the Y crime scene was subjected to a
theodolite test [FN941] by Visual Information Specialists Cyrus
Grover and Michael Taister from the FBI Laboratory in
Washington, D.C. Grover and Taister were present in connection
with their responsibilities as members of the FBI's Shooting
Incident Review Team. They employed a theodolite test to
measure distances with a laser beam from a reference point to
the location of each piece of evidence. Grover saw that many of
the small red flags in the area had been knocked over. Using
the theodolite system, Grover began to take measurements of some
of the undisturbed flags and some of the evidence that had not
been removed. [FN942] The measurements were recorded and later
used to produce a computer-generated diagram of the crime scene,
fixing locations where evidence had been found. 

  Upon his return to Washington, Grover began to prepare a
sketch of the Y crime scene with appropriate orientation data.
Before he had finished, he was injured during a vacation and
went on extended sick leave. during Grover's absence, Taister
faxed the working copy to the FBI's Salt Lake City office in the
mistaken belief that it was complete and accurate. [FN943] 

  On December 22, 1992, Rampton discovered that the
orientation of the diagram Grover and Taister had generated was
inaccurate and that the location of much of the evidence
recovered was not on the sketch. Upon inquiry, Rampton was told
that the diagram was an inaccurate working copy. [FN944] 

  On December 22, 1992, Rampton discovered that the
orientation of the diagram Grover and Taister had generated was
inaccurate and that the location of much of the evidence
recovered was not on the sketch. Upon inquiry, Rampton was told
that the diagram was an inaccurate working copy. [FN944] 

  HRT member Lon Horiuchi showed Robert Dean the position on
the mountainside from which he fired two shots on August 22. On
August 31, Dean showed Horiuchi's position to James Cadigan, who
was assigned to assist the Review Team's inquiry. [FN945] 
Grover and Taister, as part of the FBI's Shooting Incident
Review Team, used the theodolite measuring system to obtain
information for the investigation of the August 22 shots at the
cabin area. 

  On September 1, Grover and Taister accompanied Cadigan to
the mountainside. By this time, Horiuchi had left. Cadigan had
difficulty finding the position that Dean had identified, but
finally pointed to a position from which he believed Horiuchi
had fired. [FN946] 

  The diagram was erroneous because Cadigan had not correctly
identified Horiuchi's position at the time of the shots to
Grover and Taister. [FN949] Furthermore, the theodolite
measurements were based on the location of the birthing shed
when the measurements were taken. However, the Hostage Rescue
Team had moved the birthing shed during the standoff. [FN950] 

   d. Searches of the Cabin and Surrounding Area 

  After Weaver and his family had surrendered, the cabin was
searched on August 31, September 1, and September 10, 1992. In
preparation for the searches, two briefings were held to give
assignments and to review procedures for handling evidence.
[FN951] The first search was made immediately after the BATF
declared the cabin safe to enter. The cabin was videotaped
before and after the search. [FN952] Approximately ten agents
were inside the cabin when the searches were conducted, with
Rampton in charge. [FN953] 

  Each piece of evidence was identified by an evidence number
and photographed with the evidence number. [FN954] An evidence
log was maintained that included a description of each piece of
seized evidence. Personnel inside the cabin wore gloves to
preserved latent fingerprints. At the conclusion of the search,
items seized were placed in a HUMMV vehicle for transportation
to the base of the mountain. The evidence was then transferred
from the HUMMV to a U-Haul truck under Rampton's supervision. 
The truck was padlocked, and the evidence was driven to Boise,
Idaho for storage. [FN955] 

  Rampton initially instructed the agents to retrieve only a
representative sampling of the ammunition inside the cabin. 
This instruction was countermanded by Howen and Special Agent in
Charge Glenn. [FN956] 

  The searches of the areas surrounding the cabin were
conducted by approximately twenty agents from the FBI and BATF
and officers from local agencies. That group was broken down
into four teams of two or three searchers. The teams worked in
a counterclockwise direction, placing markers near objects that
might have evidentiary value. After the area was searched,
another group was responsible for photographing, sketching,
logging, tagging, and seizing objects. [FN957] 

  During one of the searches of the around the cabin, Howen
found a blue spiral notebook in the birthing shed, which
contained swastikas. "Arise on White Man" poems, and right wing
statements and quotations. [FN958] Howen complained that the
notebook was not available during his preparation for trial
because it had not been seized. [FN959] 

  On Sunday, August 30, Jackie Brown, a friend of the Weaver
family, assisted Bo Gritz in carrying the body of Vicki Weaver
out of the cabin. After taking the body to a helicopter, Brown
returned to the forward command post. She approached a group of
six to eight law enforcement officials and requested water and
towels to clean the cabin. She was handed two five-gallon
buckets, three white bath towels, and a roll of paper towels. 
She remembers that HRT Commander Richard Rogers was among the
group. [FN960] 

  FBI negotiator Lanceley remembers that he was in the
forward command post when Brown came down the hill to get water. 
He saw once HRT member assist her in taking the water part way
up. Lanceley remembers that Special Agent in Charge Robin
Montgomery saw Brown with the water and told Lanceley to stop
her. Lanceley ran out of the command post and yelled to Brown
who had rounded the bend at the top of the hill and was
approaching the cabin. She did not stop. According to
Lanceley, Montgomery was not consulted before the water was
given to Brown. [FN961] 

  When Brown returned to the Weaver cabin, she cleaned Vicki
Weaver's blood from the floor because she did not want the
Weaver daughters to "deal with cleaning the blood of their
mother from the floor," since they "had been through enough."
[FN962] Brown gathered the blood soaked towels from the cabin
and threw them off the rear deck. 

   3. Discussion 

   a. Techniques Employed to Update Evidence 

  The searches of the area near the Weaver residence,
including the Y, coordinated by the FBI, have been criticized as
disorganized, confused, and unsecured. Much of the criticism
noted that too many people were involved in the searches,
creating confusion, and that access to the crime scenes was not
sufficiently restricted. [FN963] It was also apparent to some
who conducted the searches that many agents who participated
were inexperienced in crime scene search techniques and had not
been trained for this assignment. [FN964] 

  These allegations have some merit. The use of metal
detectors by untrained FBI agents and other personnel at the
crime scene resulted in incomplete searches. [FN965] For
example, a private metal detection expert, Richard Graham,
searched the Y in March 1993 and located the butt plate of Sammy
Weaver's rifle. This search was conducted approximately six
months after the FBI searches and with snow on the ground. We
believe that the inexperience of the agents who used the metal
detectors in the initial searches and the apparent lack of
organization contributed to the failure to locate this and
perhaps other pieces of evidence. 

  If agents with expertise in the use of metal detectors had
been on the scene at the initial searches, the butt plate of
Sammy Weaver's rifle may have been discovered much earlier. 
Other valuable evidence which could have been utilized by the
prosecution in formulating the charges may have been lost
because of the use of agents inexperienced in metal detection. 

   b. Techniques Used to Record the Location of
Evidence 

  Because Agent Thundercloud's diagram of the location of
evidence and the other techniques the FBI employed were based on
only one fixed reference point -- a tree stump -- locations
could not be noted with precision. [FN966] To provide a second
point of reference, Venkus would note that pieces of evidence
were found, near some other point or near another piece of
evidence. Compass headings were not utilized to memorialize the
location of evidence, and an accurate record was not made of the
elevations where evidence was located. [FN967] 

  In our view, these techniques lacked the precision required
for a crime scene search of this importance. As Lindquist
noted, the FBI's methods allowed one to locate a piece of
evidence "fairly close" to where it had been found, but "fairly
close" was not sufficient for trial, in which, for example, the
location of Degan's casings became "very critical." [FN968] 

  Although the FBI explained that triangulation could not be
utilized in the crime scene investigation because of uneven
terrain, it was unprofessional not to use triangulation in such
an important case. Triangulation is an established method of
accurately locating significant pieces of evidence and is
utilized in most homicide investigations. As noted earlier, the
accurate location of the shell casings from Degan's rifle was
significant. The exact placement of those shells using
triangulation would have assisted in determining the credibility
of Deputy Marshal Cooper in his account of Degan's actions with
his weapon during the shootout. 

  If agents with expertise in the use of metal detectors had
been on the scene at the initial searches, the butt plate of
Sammy Weaver's rifle may have been discovered much earlier. 
Other valuable evidence which could have been utilized by the
prosecution in formulating the charges may have been lost

  We agree with the trial team that triangulation or some
other scientifically precise method should have been used in an
investigation of such importance. 

   c. The "Magic Bullet" and Allegations of Staged
Evidence 

  The events surrounding the discovery and retrieval of the
"magic bullet" generated allegations of staged or manipulated
evidence. [FN969] We have not found evidence of intentional
concealment, staging, or a lack of a good faith on the part of
the FBI or the other law enforcement agencies that assisted in
the searches. However, we believe that poor judgment by those
who conducted the crime scene searches created confusion and, as
manifested by the "magic bullet" episode, that poor judgment 
harmed the government's case. 

  The inability of the FBI to have a photographer available
at all times during the crime scene investigation is difficult
to understand. At such a critical stage of the investigation, a
photographer should have been available to photograph and
properly designate all evidence as it was originally discovered. 
Such an important case demanded the proper identification of
evidence in order to alleviate any questions of admissibility. 

  Lindquist believed that the testimony of an FBI agent about
the bullet's removal from and replacement at the crime scene
left the jury with the impression that the agent was not being
genuine: the jury must have concluded that "[e]ither [the
agent's] deceitful or he's so incompetent that I can't rely upon
[his testimony]." [FN970] Lindquist believed that the episode
contributed to a taint that spread across the government's
case, which made it impossible for the jury to trust what the
government was saying. That lack of trust was a "big part of
the trial." [FN971] 

   d. Erroneous FBI Diagram of Sniper/Observer Position 

  In our view, the erroneous diagram is attributable to
Dean's failure to mark the position when Horiuchi identified the
spot from which he had fired. Furthermore, had Grover and
Taister been more thoroughly briefed on events during the
standoff, they would have known that the outbuildings had been
moved. 

  The lack of precision in preparing the shooting position
diagrams could have had a serious effect on the government's
trial preparation and could have been admitted as demonstrative
evidence during trial if the mistake had not been detected. 
Although the mistake was discovered before trial, the
prosecution was concerned that the diagrams constituted
exculpatory material that could have had a critical impact at
trial. [FN972] 

   e. Erroneous Diagram of the Y 

  The investigators who were sent out to take the
measurements and prepare diagrams of the crime scene did not
have a sufficient understanding of the facts and circumstances. 
Surely, in such an important investigation, it was necessary for
these agents to have a thorough knowledge of the events,
possibly based on briefings from participants themselves. The
FBI should have had complete and accurate briefings for agents
conducting the Shooting Incident Review. The unavailability of
one of the Visual Information Specialists during a crucial stage
led to further confusion and further inaccuracy. This
demonstrates a lack of overall planning and coordination in
conducting such investigations. 

  In our view, this error should have not occurred. The
precision essential for crime scene searches and evaluations was
inexcusably lacking in this investigation. The mix-up in
sending the "working" diagram could have been avoided had
communications been better and had more professional procedures
been in place. 

   f. Jackie Brown and Cabin Clean Up 

  Jackie Brown's actions have been criticized as
contaminating the crime scene. Technically, that is correct. 
However, her efforts may have served a more important purpose in
contributing toward the resolution of the crisis. 

  It is unclear whether the FBI command structure considered
the significance of Brown's actions. Montgomery did not know
whether Brown's actions were authorized or whether they were
spontaneous. He affirmed that we was not consulted before Brown
obtained the water and that he was not in a position to delay
her while her plans were assessed. [FN973] 

  We have not been able to determine whether anyone weighed
the likely negative impact of contamination of the crime scene
against the potentially positive impact Brown's actions might
have in resolving the crisis. In our view, the fact that Brown
was able to return to the cabin with water and paraphernalia
without the approval of Montgomery, the FBI's ranking supervisor
at the forward command post, shows that the command and control
of the situation was less than perfect. Nevertheless, in
retrospect we believe that the decision to allow Brown to clean
the cabin, however it was reached, was proper. 

   4. Conclusion 

  Those involved in the crime scene searches at Ruby Ridge
have assessed those searches very differently. Those who
planned and supervised the searches generally gave them high
marks. [FN974] Other law enforcement personnel who participated
in or became familiar with the searches were highly critical. 
The criticism came from FBI personnel, as well as others. 

  In our view, three factors contributed significantly to the
difficulty of conducting the crime scene searches. First, the
searches were conducted during an ongoing effort to resolve the
crisis. Second, an unusually large number of law enforcement
personnel from a wide variety of federal, state, and local law
enforcement components were at the site, adding to the confusion
and congestion. Third, the terrain was extremely rough, uneven,
and covered with dense foliage. 

  Many of the deficiencies of the crime scene searches are
attributable to one or more of those factors. However, in our
view, other shortcomings probably could have been avoided, for
example, the failure to cordon off the search ares at the
conclusion of a search, the inexperience of those who operated
metal detectors that resulted in the failure to discover at
least one important piece of evidence, the "magic bullet"
episode, the lack of precision in measuring the location of
discovered evidence, and the failure to understand the possible
negative impact of Brown's actions. 


  Many of the problems that attended the crime-scene searches
could have been avoided had an experienced evidence-recovery
team been summoned. We disagree with Glenn's characterization
of Ruby Ridge as a "normal murder crime scene." The use of the
Evidence Response Team would certainly have added badly needed
experience and expertise to the investigation and may very well
have alleviated a number of the problems that we discuss here. 
The Ruby Ridge crime scene investigation was difficult. Those
who conducted the search had participated in the tiring, tension
filled operation that ultimately resolved the standoff. As a
consequence, some aspects of the crime-scene search were
confused and incomplete. The utilization of sophisticated,
professional, evidence location, retrieval, identification, and
preservation techniques in this case was necessary.

  965 The FBI used three metal detectors during the initial
searches at the Y. Two were rented and appeared to be "well
used." The rented detectors were not as sensitive as the third. 
FBI Special Agent David Barker operated the third detector, but
had no experience in using a metal detector. Apparently, none
of the operators of metal detectors at the initial searches were
experienced. FD-302 Interview of David Barker, October 12,
1993, at 1-2. 

  According to Lucien Haag, the use of metal detection
equipment is a skill that "needs to be continuously honed." He
recommended that agents be taught how to operate detector
equipment effectively. FD-302 Interview of Lucien Haag, October
12, 1993, at 3. 

  966 For example, if a bullet casing had been found 10 feet
from the stump, Thundercloud's diagram would not reveal the
precise location of the casing along an arc twenty feet from the
stump. 

  967 Special Agent Curtis Kastens of the Idaho Bureau of
Investigation participated in the searches. He thought that the
searches at the Y wee not handled appropriately for a murder
investigation and that some form of reconstruction, including
"to-scale elevations," should have been attempted. Kastens also
thought that more time should have been allowed for accurate
measurements. Kastens FD-302, at 3. 

  968 Lindquist Interview, Tape 3, at 17. During
Thundercloud's cross examination, the defense was very critical
of the failure to utilize triangulation or compass headings.

IV. SPECIFIC ISSUES INVESTIGATED

J.   The FBI Laboratory

1.   Introduction

     The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Idaho ("USAO"),
components of the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service, local law
enforcement agencies, and the trial court all criticized the
performance of the FBI Laboratory ("Laboratory") during the course
of the Weaver trial.  In this section, we will examine the
timeliness and quality of the Laboratory's response to requests for
tests, its refusal to perform certain tests, and its neglect to do
others.

     2.   Statement of Facts

     a.   FBI Laboratory Processing Procedure

     Special Agents Gregory Rampton and Joseph Venkus, the FBI case
agents for the Weaver/Harris prosecution, coordinated the
submission of evidence to the FBI Laboratory for examination.  They
were responsible for disseminating the results of the examinations
to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boise.  Assistant U.S. Attorney
Lindquist was primarily responsible for Laboratory related issues
for the prosecution.

     It is FBI policy that when the Laboratory receives a request
from a field office to examine evidence, a principal examiner is
assigned to the matter.  The examiner assigns a priority to the
request.  Cases for which the FBI is primarily responsible are
given the highest priority, followed by cases involving violent
crimes, cases involving crimes against property, and cases in 
which a judicial proceeding is unlikely.  In practice, we found that
pendency of a trial date is the overriding factor determining
whether a case becomes a priority.

     The principal examiner forwards items of evidence to the
appropriate unit within the Laboratory, prepares a report when the
examination has been completed, and returns the items to the field
office with the report.

     The principal examiner in the weaver matter was Supervisory
Special Agent James Cadigan of the Firearms/Toolmarks Unit. 
Cadigan directed the requests for examinations from the field to
various Laboratory components; formalized the final reports; and
oversaw the return of evidence.  One hundred and ninety nine pieces
of evidence were submitted to the Laboratory for 350 examinations. 
Cadigan conveyed the results of the examinations to Venkus or
Rampton by telephone, who would send a written report by facsimile
to the USAO.  When the agents received the final, written
Laboratory reports, they would also send them to the USAO.  The
Laboratory generated twelve reports in the Weaver matter.

          b.   Timeliness and Neglected Tests

     On January 8, 1993, a conference was held in the chambers of
U.S. District Court Judge Lodge.  The defense requested that the
trial date of February 2, 1993 be postponed because of the volume
of information and documents to be reviewed and because not all of
the Laboratory examinations had been completed.  Judge Lodge
admonished the government to provide the results of the
examinations quickly.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen told the court
that he was attempting to comply with the court's instructions, but
that he had no control over the delay caused by the FBI
Laboratory. [FN975]

     Following Weaver's sentencing, Judge Lodge issued a contempt
order against the FBI and levied a fine because the prosecution had
"receiv[ed] less than full cooperation from the FBI" and the Bureau
had not produced items of evidence "timely." [FN976]  The court referred
to the FBI's "recalcitrance" and held that he Bureau had
"evidence[d] a callous disregard for the rights of the defendants
and the interests of justice and demonstrate[d] a complete lack of
respect for the order and directions of [the] court." [FN977] 

     This inquiry had determined that, by January 8, 1993, the date
of the chambers conference, the FBI Laboratory had completed four
reports. [FN978]  After the conference, the Laboratory submitted reports
on January 8, January 13, January 21, January 22, February 25,
March 17, April 12, and April 13.  The 44 items analyzed in those
reports were submitted to the Laboratory between August 28 and
November 27, 1992. [FN979]  The majority of tests outstanding on January
8 were serology tests and hair, fiber, and DNA tests of pieces of
clothing.  The FBI received Vicki and Sammy Weaver's hair and blood
samples on January 5 and 29, 1993.  Deputy Marshal Degan's blood
samples were prematurely returned to the Seattle field office where
they were allowed to spoil.  Most of the test results on the Weaver
blood samples were included in the January Laboratory reports.

     After the chambers conference, the FBI Laboratory received
eight requests for examinations in the Weaver matter, which were
completed according to the following schedule:

Date of Communication - Date of Response

January 11, 1993 - February 25, 1993

January 20, 1993 - March 17, 1993

January 28, 1993 - February 25, 1993

February 11, 1993 - February 25, 1993

March 21, 1993 - April 12, 1993

April 2, 1993 - April 13, 1993

April 9, 1993 - April 13, 1993

May 26, 1993 - June 7, 1993 

[FN980]

     The first examination that appears to have been neglected was
a request on August 27, 1992 to determine whether two pieces of
metal were once part of Degan's canteen clip.  The second neglected
examination was a request on September 9 to compare blood samples
of Vicki and Sammy Weaver with blood found on tow jackets and a
pair of pants. [FN981]  The third was a request on
October 28 to determine whether holes in Degan's backpack and the
clothing it contained had been caused by a bullet. [FN982]

     There was no response to these requests in the Laboratory
report of December 23, 1992.  The field office again requested
these examinations on January 5, 1993.  The Laboratory responded on
January 22.  A more detailed discussion of these tests follows. 

(1)  Degan's Backpack

     Cadigan told our inquiry that he does not know why the
examination of the backpack and its contents was overlooked.  The
report on the backpack notes that an "exit" hole in the backpack
and holes in the clothing inside had a "linear relationship" and
could have been caused by a bullet or bullet fragments.  The report
states that no other determinations or conclusions could be
made. [FN983]

     During the trial, a defense attorney found another hole in a
fold of the backpack. [FN984]  We asked Cadigan whether he had attempted
to locate all entrance and exit holes in Degan's backpack.  He
replied that he had examined the backpack closely and did not
discover any damage, other than that noted in his reports. [FN985]

(2)  Blood and Hair Examinations

     After being retrieved from Ruby Ridge, Deputy Marshal Degan's
body was taken to a morgue for an autopsy, which was performed on
August 22, 1992 by Dr. George Lindholm.  FBI Special Agent John
attended the autopsy, along with representatives of the U.S.
Marshals Service, the Boundary County Sheriff's Office, and the
Boundary County Coroner's Office.  A photographic record and log of
the autopsy was kept, and John retained several items of evidence,
including hair samples and two tubes of blood, which were sent to
the Laboratory on August 14 for "whatever analysis you deem
appropriate."

     The Laboratory received the evidence on August 25, 1992. 
Within two days, Cadigan performed the obvious tests on the bullet
fragments which had been removed from Degan's body and provided the
preliminary results to SIOC for transmission to the crisis site. 
Cadigan sent the final results to the Seattle field office which
had sent the material.  Because no specific requests had been made
as to the blood and hair samples, Cadigan asked the field office to
specify the tests that should be conducted.  The field office was
unsure about the tests needed and explained that the material had
been sent just to "cover all the bases." [FN986]

     In September, 1992, the Laboratory received Harris and Randy
Weaver's blood samples.  Because the Laboratory had "insufficient
space to maintain items of evidence," they were returned to the
field office. [FN987]  The items were placed in a bulky exhibit, 
and the blood spoiled because it was not refrigerated.

     The FBI Hostage Rescue Team discovered Sammy Weaver's body,
while clearing the birthing shed near the Weaver cabin on August
23, 1992.  Dr. Lindholm conducted an autopsy on August 25.  Special
Agent John attended, along with representatives of the Boundary
County Sheriff and Coroner's Offices.  At the time, the
circumstances surrounding Sammy Weaver's death were unknown, and
the Sheriff's Office was proceeding on the assumption that the
death was a homicide.  Consequently, the office took samples of all
the evidence from the autopsy, including blood and hair samples,
for the Idaho State Crime Laboratory. [FN988]

     On August 31, 1992, Dr. Lindholm conducted an autopsy of Vicki
Weaver's body, attended by John and representatives of the U.S.
Marshals Service, the Boundary County Sheriff's Office, and the
Boundary County Coroner.  The FBI retained several items, including
hair samples, as evidence, but there is no indication that a blood
sample was retained. [FN989]  On September 3, the evidence was sent to
the FBI Laboratory. [FN990]

     Dr. Lindholm's autopsy reports for Degan and Sammy and Vicki
Weaver show that body fluids and tissue, including purge fluid and
blood and hair samples, were taken during each autopsy.  As
standard procedure, Dr. Lindholm provided blood and hair samples to
the investigating agency. [FN991]

     On September 3, 1992, the FBI Laboratory was asked to examine
certain clothing to see whether blood and hair could be identified
as that of Randy Weaver, Kevin Harris, Vicki Weaver, or Sammy
Weaver. [FN992]  Cadigan submitted the clothing for hair and fiber
tests.  These tests were completed on October 2.

     When Rampton reviewed the December 23, 1992 Laboratory report,
he discovered that blood and hair examinations had not been
performed.  The Laboratory told him that blood samples for Degan,
Vicki Weaver, and Sammy Weaver and Harris' hair sample had not been
sent to the Laboratory. [FN993]

     On January 4, 1993, blood samples taken from Degan, Sammy
Weaver and Vicki Weaver were obtained from Dr. Lindholm and sent to
the Laboratory. [FN994]  The examinations were completed and reported on
January 21.  On January 28, pursuant to a court order, samples of
Harris' hair were taken and forwarded to the FBI Laboratory.

     When the FBI Laboratory received a request for additional
blood and hair comparisons on January 5, 1993, Cadigan realized
that the FBI did not have the blood samples.  The samples were
submitted on January 6. [FN995]  The examinations were completed and
provided to the USAO on January 15 and given to the defense on
January 27.

c.   Refusal to Perform Tests and Hiring of
Independent Experts

     In one instance, the Laboratory refused to conduct a requested
examination and, in several instance, the Laboratory determined
that certain examinations were not possible.

     During trial preparation, the USAO entered into contracts with
three forensic specialists: Lucien Haag, a "shooting
reconstructionist," Richard Graham a metal detection expert, and
Dr. Marin Fackler, a wound ballistician.  According to the
prosecutors, these people were retained because the FBI Laboratory
was unwilling or unable to provide assistance in their areas of
expertise. [FN996]

(1)  Refusal to Conduct Test

     On March 21, 1993, the Laboratory was asked to determine the
caliber of the bullet which passed through Sammy Weaver's jacket
causing the fatal wound.  The Laboratory may, at the examiner's
discretion, refuse to conduct an examination if the examination and
result have no basis in scientific theory, thereby precluding the
examiner from testifying as to the result.  Cadigan has asserted
that no test recognized by forensic science enables an examiner to
determine with any certainty the caliber of the bullet which caused
a hole in clothing because there are too many variables and the
exact anatomical position of the victim cannot be determined.  For
this reason, Cadigan refused to conduct the examination.  When the
Laboratory received another request to determine the caliber of
the bullet that had struck Sammy Weaver, the Laboratory did conduct
tests, but could not "definitely state exactly what caliber bullet
went through the coat." [FN997]

(2)  Shooting Reconstruction

     Early in the trial preparation, Lindquist told the FBI case
agents that the case needed an expert to reconstruct the shooting
events at the Y on August 21 to corroborate the marshals'
testimony.  The agents replied that "there's no such thing."
Lindquist explained that a shooting reconstructionist, on the basis
of the physical evidence, can determine, among other things, the
"directionality" of a bullet's trajectory. [FN995]

     After some discussion, case agent Venkus called the FBI
Laboratory and was told that the Laboratory does not do shooting
reconstructions.  With a sense of exasperation, Lindquist asked one
of the deputy marshals assigned to the case to find one of the best
shooting reconstructionists in the country and, within 24 hours, he
was given Lucien Haag's name.  When they spoke, Haag asked
Lindquist why he was not using the FBI Laboratory because Haag had
worked previously with someone in the Laboratory on a
reconstruction.

     Confused by the conflicting information he had received,
Lindquist called Cadigan and was told that the Laboratory did do
shooting reconstruction and that he was the FBI's expert in the
area.  Cadigan asked why a private expert was needed.  Lindquist
told Cadigan that he would continue with the private expert, though
he would appreciate the FBI's cooperation.  Lindquist accepted
Cadigan's request to accompany the prosecutors when they visited
the crime scene in March 1993. [FN999]

     According to Lindquist, Cadigan seemed enthusiastic about
participating in the case.  Lindquist found Cadigan very helpful
from that point forward, although he appeared far less
knowledgeable than the private expert. [FN1000] 

     Rampton recalled Lindquist's request for a shooting
reconstructionist and telling Lindquist that the Laboratory did not
have shooting reconstruction as a single discipline.  Rampton told
Lindquist that he would check with the Laboratory.  He spoke with
Cadigan, who confirmed that the Laboratory did not have shooting
reconstruction as a single discipline.  Rampton claims he informed
Lindquist of this and heard nothing more until Haag had been
retained. [FN1001]

     Cadigan recalls a phone call from a case agent about whether
the FBI had a shooting reconstructionist.  Cadigan told the agent
that no single person could testify about every aspect of the
reconstruction.  Cadigan confirmed this within the Laboratory and
informed the case agent that a shooting was usually reconstructed
within a confined space such as a building so that impact points
could be located and angles established.  Although the shooting at
the Y would be more difficult to reconstruct, Cadigan said that the
Laboratory would do what it could and that the agent should advise
the Laboratory if the prosecution wanted a reconstruction.  Cadigan
heard nothing more on the matter. [FN1002]

     Lindquist does not recall Cadigan's explaining that the FBI
Laboratory has a multi-disciplinary approach to shooting
reconstruction or that no one person would be able to testify about
the many examinations. [FN1003]

(3)  Wound Ballistics and Metal Detection

     During this inquiry, we found no requests by the USAO for FBI
experts in metal detection or wound ballistics.  Metal detection
experts are available within the FBI's Information Services
Division.  Although the FBI Laboratory does not have a wound
ballistics expert, it consults with experts at the Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology, and this expertise would have been
available on request.

(4)  Acoustic Testing

     Initially the prosecution believed that evidence of the
acoustics of the shooting scene on August 21, 1992 would be
valuable.  The prosecutors were referred to an FBI acoustics expert
to evaluate this aspect of the case.  Lindquist was disappointed
with the FBI's expertise in the field. [FN1004]  The
prosecution did attempt an acoustics test in the area of the Weaver
cabin with the assistance of two marshal and ultimately concluded
that such a test would not be productive.

d.   Failure to Comply with discovery

     The final issue raised by Judge Lodge about the FBI Laboratory
concerns the mailing of notes and test firings of the weapons.  The
defense orally requested production of Cadigan's notes and the test
firings at the end of the first week or the beginning of the second
week in May 1992.

     Cadigan recalled receiving a call, possibly on Monday, May 10,
1993, from Venkus advising him that the court intended to order
production of his notes and the test firings.  Cadigan received
"the distinct direction" from Venkus to wait until a court order
had been issued before sending test samples and notes. [FN1005]  He
sought advice on the matter from the FBI's Legal Counsel Division,
which suggested to the USAO reasons why the notes and the test
firings should not be given to the defense. [FN1006]

     On Thursday, May 13, Cadigan received an angry call from
Special Agent Dillon asking where the test firings were.  Cadigan
explained that he was waiting for a court order.  Dillon told
Cadigan to send the notes and test firings to Boise immediately. 
Because Cadigan did not wish to "cause the Agents a problem," he
facsimiled his notes to Boise.  The facsimile was poor, and Cadigan
express-mailed the notes and test firings to Boise, securing the
envelope flaps with tape before placing them into a box for
shipment.

     The following day, Friday, Cadigan was informed that three of
the envelopes had opened during shipment and that the contents had
spilled out and had become commingled.  He instructed the caller to
express-mail the test firings to the Laboratory where he could
rectify the problem by examining microscopic markings.  The test
firings arrived on May 17, 1993.  Cadigan immediately placed them
in the appropriate envelopes and sent the test firings. by
express-mail to Boise. [FN1007]  The prosecution advised the Court 
that the test firings available for defense review on May 18.  
According to Dillon, this delayed the trial and
produced additional discovery problems.

3.   Discussion

     In analyzing the performance of the FBI Laboratory, we
interviewed field and Laboratory personnel; analyzed field
communications requesting examinations and transmitting physical
evidence; audited Laboratory reports and tracking of examined
articles; assessed criticisms by agencies and interested parties;
inspected the crime scenes; and reviewed grand jury testimony,
court proceedings, and autopsy reports.

a.   Problems with Delays in Test Results

     Our investigation revealed that Judge Lodge, as well as the
trial team, the FBI field agents, and their supervisors were not
satisfied with the response of the FBI Laboratory in this case. 
[FN1008] In exploring the delays in conducting and reporting 
examinations, we discovered a lack of coordination, communication, 
and cooperation within the FBI.  Unfortunately, these delays had
significant impact on the government's discovery obligations and
the way the government was perceived by the court and at trial.

     Perhaps every prosecution team thinks that its case is most
important and that the Laboratory should respond accordingly.  In
this case, we agree with the prosecutors that the Weaver
prosecution was a most important case that should have been placed
on an expedited and coordinated tracking system.

     We question the wisdom of the FBI Laboratory's practice of
using the trial date as the primary triggering criterion for
Laboratory results.  It is beyond dispute that a trial team needs
test results well before the trial and, ideally, before they  must
be turned over to the defense. [FN1009]

     We also question the practice of accumulating test results in
a single report.  Reporting test results as they are determined
would enable problems to be detected and resolved earlier.  The
procedure would also permit additional tests to be requested and
completed in a ore timely fashion.  Our inquiry found that written
notifications to the field beyond these collective reports were
also late or non-existent.  Although or inspectors were told that
telephonic notifications were made on a regular basis, no
documentation could be located.  Consequently, we can make no
specific determination of the number, date, or contents of
telephonic notifications.  The prosecutors said they received no
Laboratory test results until the latter part of November or the
first part of December about evidence they began to collect in
August. [FN1010]

     We find it unreasonable that tests requested in August and
September were completed in December.  We find the practice of
sending samples back to the field because "specific instructions"
are not contained in the request unreasonable and indicative of
poor communication and coordination. [FN1011]

     When Laboratory tests require additional evidence or specific
instructions, communication with the most knowledgeable people, the
case agents or the prosecutors, should be continuous.  The delay
caused by the lack of blood samples could have been prevented by
coordination and effort.  When Degan's blood samples were shipped
with requests that were not "specific" enough for the Laboratory,
it should have contacted the case agents to get specific advice.
Instead, the Laboratory sent the blood to the transmitting office
where it was allowed to spoil.  Cadigan noted that the case agents
did not "key on" the return of samples. [FN1012]  We do not believe
the responsibility for this delay lies wit the agents alone.  The
December discovery that the blood of Vicki Weaver and Sammy Weaver
and Kevin Harris' hair samples had not been transmitted to the 
FBI Laboratory for tests requested in early September in another 
example of a lack of coordination.

     Cadigan believed that the Laboratory received requests for
examinations that fit the prosecutors' "theory of the week" and
that the resulting tension between the prosecutors and the case
agents adversely affected the coordination necessary between the
field and the Laboratory for timely and effective processing of
evidence. [FN1013]

     One of the reasons the case agents give for the continued
delays after Judge Lodge's Order was the burden placed on the
Laboratory by unnecessary and unreasonable requests by the USAO. 
According to Rampton, the sole purpose of some requests was to avid
the defense focusing on Degan's weapon, upon which the Laboratory
had already completed and ejection pattern test.  However,
Lindquist told us that test firings of all weapons were necessary
to locate where Degan and the others, including Harris and Sammy
Weave, were during the shooting at the Y.  Although he conceded
that the test of Degan's weapon was more critical, Lindquist wanted
to have all the weapons tested to show the jury that the government
was not being selective in its testing.  We find this explanation
reasonable.

     We are not convinced that the delays were the result of
unnecessary requests by the prosecution team.  Rather, we find a
lack of initiative by the Laboratory in conducting examinations
beyond the specific request.  The use of private  experts
apparently renewed the Laboratory's interest in an commitment to
the case.  That was a costly and unnecessary expense.  Our inquiry
found that nothing done by the independent examiners fell outside
the FBI's expertise.

     In addition we find that the Laboratory's failure to respond
in a timely manner contributed to the trial judge's perception that
the government was not meeting its discovery obligations.  Although
the FBI Laboratory did much significant and professional work, the
problems apparent in delays and lack of initiative should be
remedied.  If the primary cause for delays and failure to
coordinate is the result of strained resources, priorities should 
be reevaluated.  If the response in this matter is typical of high
profile homicide cases involving the death of a federal law
enforcement officer and two citizens, we wonder about the response
to matters of less importance.

b.   Failure to Provide Expertise and the Hiring of
Independent Experts

     Our investigation revealed a lack of cooperation and
initiative by the Laboratory beyond specific tests requested.  We
found that the requisite expertise was present at the Laboratory,
but it was something that the USAO had to discover.  We share the
prosecutors' disappointment in the Laboratory's lack of initiative
or involvement in the case.  We can empathize with the prosecutors
who wanted to use the FBI for experts and receive the benefit of
the Laboratory's suggestions in developing the prosecution theory. 
Although we cannot address the soundness of the examinations the
private experts and prosecutors requested, many of the problems and
the perception of incompetence could have been avoided by direct
conversation between the prosecutors and the Laboratory.

     Cadigan was aware that the idea for some tests, including the
attempt to recreate the hole in Sammy Weaver's jacket, had
originated with the private expert, and the case agents were
frustrated that  the prosecutors were going outside "normal
investigative channels" by hiring experts to conduct "alternative
examinations" that would not be done by the Laboratory. [FN1014] 
Cadigan believes that one of the main differences between the FBI
Laboratory and private examiners is that the FBI Laboratory is
"extremely conservative" and that FBI examiners will not testify to
results not based on scientific fact because the Laboratory must
maintain its reputation of being able to withstand cross
examination.  He believes that this distinguished FBI scientists
from the majority of experts retained by defense counsel, whose
primary purpose is to propose alternate theories to those advanced
by the prosecution.

     If the government's cases are to be presented successfully and
fairly in the courtroom, the technical expertise of the FBI
Laboratory must be available to assist trial teams beyond areas
about which Laboratory experts can testify.  For example, test
firings of the weapons at the Y during the August 21 shooting were
significant for planning the prosecution's theory and establishing
trial strategy.  The prosecutors and the rest of the trial team
needed timely assistance from experts in interpreting evidence. 
Developing alternate theories of how events occurred is part of the
investigative and trial preparation process.  The scope of
information that a prosecutor must develop should not be limited
during trial preparation only to admissible tests and  evidence.

     An example of a test conducted by the independent examiner
that the prosecution found helpful was an identification by
elimination.  The independent examiner did an analysis of
cartridges found at the Y with weapons known to have been on the
scene to exclude those that could not have been responsible for the
cartridges.  The FBI Laboratory expert viewed this form of
identification as unscientific in that other unknown weapons may
have been at the site.  Nevertheless, the elimination of some
weapons would assist the prosecutor in making decisions.  It would
also help at trial to know which weapons are capable of making a
bullet hole associated with the fatal wound.

     We believe a more coordinated, professional, creative, and
cooperative approach to litigation and investigations would be far
more helpful than the process we discovered in the Weaver matter.

c.   Discovery Demand for Test Firings and Laboratory Notes

     Our investigation found that the delay in turning over
Laboratory notes and test firings was one of several examples of
the FBI resistance to, disagreement with, and misunderstanding of
its discovery obligations in the Weaver case.  We found the FBI's
actions and decisions inappropriate.  A court should not be
compelled to order discovery compliance to resolve disputes between
components of the government.  Understandably, the delays caused by
this attitude evoked a negative response from the court and
counsel.

     We found no evidence that the delays in the Laboratory tests
were designed or intended to postpone the trial or obstruct
justice.  The decision to wait for an order was in conflict with
the "open discovery" strategy of the USAO and the government's
representations of cooperation in court.  Objections to discovery
should have been addressed to the court through the USAO.  The
accidental commingling of the materials sent to Idaho and the
events that followed contributed to the court's perception that the
FBI had no regard for the rights of the accused and for the
administration of justice.

4.   Conclusion

     The lack of coordination and communication both within the FBI
and with the USAO appears to be the major cause of the delays and
the other problems examined in this section of the report.

     979 Items were also submitted on January 5, 1992.

     980 On January 20, 1993, Lindquist sent Cooper and Roderick's
weapons to the Laboratory and, on February 11, he sent Harris and
Sammy Weaver's weapons for ejection pattern tests.  The results of
the test on Degan's weapon were reported on January 22.

     On January 28, the Laboratory reported that the examinations
requested on January 20 would take ten weeks to complete.  They
were actually completed on March 17.  On February 9, the Laboratory
reported that the examinations requested on January 28 would take
ten weeks to complete.  They were completed on February 25.  On
March 31, the Laboratory reported that the examinations requested
on March 21 would take ten weeks to complete.  They were completed
on April 12.  In our opinion, these inaccurate estimates show a
lack of organization and probably made the prosecution less willing
to request additional testing.

     984 The defense asserted that the two holes would be evidence
that Degan received a shot to his back, spun around, and received
a fatal shot from Cooper.  This theory ignores the identification
of Harris' bullet as the fatal shot to Degan's chest.

that the agents attending these autopsies were not knowledgeable
about events surrounding the injuries.  FD-302 Interview of Dr.
George Lindholm, October 7, 1993, at 2.

     992 Blood and hair samples were taken from Randy Weaver after
he surrendered and were forwarded to the FBI Laboratory on
September 1, 1992.  Cadigan FD-302, August 17, 1993, at 25.  There
is no record of the Laboratory receiving blood samples of the
Weaver group, other than Randy Weaver's.  An FBI interview report
erroneously stated that a sample of Harris's hair had been taken.
After his surrender, Harris was taken to a hospital for treatment.
According to a report prepared by FBI Special Agent James T. Davis,
dated August 30, 1992, Davis took a blood sample from Harris at the
hospital and Special Agent John took hair samples.  The blood
sample was forwarded to the FBI Laboratory on September 1, 1992. 
We understand that John did not obtain hair samples.

did not know the trial date until November or December.  We find
the principal examiner's ignorance of the data symptomatic of the

IV. SPECIFIC ISSUES INVESTIGATED

 K. The Preliminary Hearings of Weaver and Harris 

  1. Introduction 

  Following their arrests, government agents transported
Weaver and Harris to hospitals to receive medical treatment for
the gunshot wounds that they had suffered. Thereafter, the
court decided to conduct separate preliminary hearings for the
two men. In addition, the federal magistrate judges handling
the preliminary hearings elected to combine the preliminary
examination and detention hearing in one proceeding. The
combined preliminary examination and detention hearing for
Weaver was scheduled to begin on September 10, 1992; the
combined preliminary examination and detention hearing for
Harris was scheduled to begin on September 14, 1992. 

  On Friday, September 11, 1992, one day after the Weaver
preliminary hearing had begun, U.S. Attorney Ellsworth appeared
in court to argue a motion seeking to continue the preliminary
hearing of Harris from September 14 to September 15 in order to
accommodate the additional security needs presented by the visit
of Vice President Quayle to Boise on September 14. It has been
alleged that Ellsworth represented in court that Harris would be
permitted a full preliminary hearing that would not be
terminated or interrupted by the return of a grand jury
indictment. With the understanding that a full preliminary
hearing would be conducted, counsel for Harris consented to the
continuance. 

   The preliminary hearing of Harris began on
September 15. On the second day of the preliminary hearing, the
proceeding were interrupted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald
Howen, who informed the court that the grand jury had just
returned an indictment against Weaver and Harris. The Weaver
preliminary hearing was also interrupted and the parties
informed of the indictment. Although the magistrate judges
ultimately decided to discontinue the preliminary hearings, they
afforded Weaver and Harris the opportunity to question witnesses
during the detention phase of the hearings. 

   It has been alleged that the government acted
improperly when it sought grand jury indictments while the
preliminary hearings were in progress. In particular, it has
been argued that once the government elected to proceed by
preliminary hearing, it was stopped from abandoning the
preliminary hearing. With regard to the Harris preliminary
proceeding, the question has been raised whether the government,
in light of the Ellsworth representations, was obliged to
complete the preliminary hearing and whether the failure to do
so violated any legal or ethical rules. 

  2. Statement of Facts 

  a. Arrest and Initial Processing of Weaver and Harris 

  On August 23, 1992, a criminal complaint was filed
charging Weaver and Harris with violations of 18 U.S.C. 111,
1111 and 1114. Harris surrendered to federal authorities on
August 30, and was taken for medical treatment to the intensive
care unit at Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane, Washington. 
The next day, Weaver surrendered and was taken to St. Lukes
Hospital in Boise for treatment. On September 2, 1992, U.S.
Magistrate Judge Cynthia Imbrogno conducted the initial
appearance of Harris in the hospital and continued his
preliminary examination and detention hearing until September 14
because of his medical condition. 

  Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen originally planned to
conduct joint preliminary hearings for Weaver and Harris but the
delay caused by the medical treatment for Harris, coupled with
federal time requirements, precluded this plan. [FN1015] As a 
result, the preliminary hearing for Weaver was scheduled for 
September 10th before Magistrate Judge Mikel Williams and the 
preliminary hearing for Harris was scheduled for September 14 
before Magistrate Judge Lawrence Boyle. The magistrate judges 
decided to conduct the preliminary hearing and detention hearing 
in one proceeding. 

  Howen was assigned to handled the Harris preliminary hearing 
while Assistant U.S. Attorney Lindquist was assigned to handle the
Weaver preliminary hearing. [FN1016] Howen initially expected
that he would present the government's case at the Harris
preliminary hearing through a summary witness and that this
presentation would take half a day. Lindquist expected each
preliminary hearing to take two days "at the most." According
to Howen, it was the normal practice of the magistrates in the
district to schedule the preliminary hearing after the grand
jury had convened, if the time requirements permitted, so as to
avoid conducting a preliminary hearing if an indictment were
going to be returned. Thus, Howen was surprised when the
magistrates set the Weaver and Harris preliminary hearings
before the grand jury met in [G.J.] [FN1019]

  From the moment that Weaver and Harris were taken into custody,
Howen intended to present an indictment at the next session of 
the grand jury which was scheduled for [G.J.]. [FN1020] All
attorneys working on the matter knew of this plan, including
U.S. Attorney Ellsworth, who as head of the office, supervised
Howen and Lindquist. Indeed, in his September 3, 1992 letter to
Special Agent in Charge Eugene Glenn, Ellsworth noted that the
grand jury proceeding would begin on [G.J.]. [FN1021]

  Howen always believed that if the grand jury were to return 
an indictment before the preliminary hearings were completed 
that the indictment would extinguish the right to the preliminary
hearing. [FN1022] He believed that Ellsworth shared this view. 
[FN1023] Indeed, Howen recalled that prior to the beginning of the
preliminary hearings, he discussed with Lindquist and he
believes also with Ellsworth the possibility that the Harris
preliminary hearing could be terminated by the return of an
indictment. [FN1024]

  b. September 10-11. 1992 

  The combined preliminary examination and detention hearing 
for Weaver began on September 10. On that day the government 
spent the entire day examining Deputy Marshal Roderick. [FN1025]
When the preliminary hearing resumed on September 11, defense 
counsel cross-examined Roderick and, in the afternoon,
the government conducted the direct examination of Deputy
Marshal Cooper. At the end of the proceedings on September 11,
it was agreed, at the request of defense counsel Gerry Spence,
that the hearing would resume on September 16, 1992. [FN1026]

  On Friday September 11, 1992, three days before the
Harris preliminary hearing was to commence, U.S. Attorney
Ellsworth, filed a motion and a supporting affidavit requesting
that the Harris preliminary hearing be continued one day until
September 15. Ellsworth explained that the Bose Chief of Police
had expressed concern to him about being able to provide
security to both the Harris preliminary hearing and to Vice
President Quayle who was scheduled to visit Boise on September
14. [FN1027] In arguing the motion to the court, Ellsworth 
[FN1028] told the court that the U.S. Secret Service had also 
expressed concern over the increased security demands created 
by the Quayle visit. [FN1029] When Judge Boyle asked for Harris' 
position on the continuance, defense counsel Nevin replied: 

  The primary concern that I have is that this not be
simply an opportunity for the government to get a grand jury
impaneled and to indict Mr. Harris and avoid the obligation to
provide him with a preliminary hearing. And I've been afraid
all along that was what was going to happen and that this would
get delayed in some way so that would be possible. 

  I understand . . . this is approximately the time when
the grand jury sits and is available. And if this is just an
effort to do that, then I certainly object to it. [FN1030]

  Now maybe Mr. Ellsworth could assure us or we could
stipulate that a preliminary will be held on Tuesday and that
there will not be an indictment filed which would supersede
that, and in that case I would be glad to stipulate to it. 

  The court then invited comment from the Government to
which Ellsworth responded: 

  As indicated in my affidavit there is no underlying basis
for this . . . beyond the representations to me of the chief of
police of Boise. . . . [W]e are prepared and ready to go to the
preliminary hearing on Monday. I am willing to give assurances
that we intend to have a preliminary hearing and there is no
ulterior motive other than the request of the chief of police of
Boise that the -- he's concerned about his security people. . .
.But there is no ulterior motive other than what's expressed in
the motion and affidavit. [FN1031]

  Thereafter, the following exchange occurred between the
parties and the court, 

  THE COURT: Okay. Do you gentlemen want to take a minute
and talk privately and then I can come back in? 

  MR. NEVIN: Yeah, I mean if -- if what counsel is saying
is that there is going to be a preliminary hearing on Tuesday
not matter what, why that's fine. I -- we -- no objection. 

  THE COURT: So you would agree and stipulate to -- 

  MR. NEVIN: Yeah. 

  THE COURT: -- to postpone the preliminary examination and
detention hearing from Monday the 14th to Tuesday the 15th? 

  MR. NEVIN: Upon that condition, yes. 

    * * * * * * 

  MR. ELLSWORTH: The government has no problem with
that stipulation. 

  THE COURT: Well, let me just understand so I don't make
a procedural mistake. And is it my understanding Mr. Nevin,
that you agree based on the representations of the United States
attorney that their motive is simply to honor requests by the
chief of police regarding Mr. Quayle's visit to Boise, you will
stipulate for a transfer of this -- or rescheduling of this from
Monday until Tuesday? 

  MR. NEVIN: Yeah. And just so I don't make a
mistake in what I'm saying. I read what Mr. Ellsworth has said
as a guaranty that we'll have a prelim on Tuesday, and that's
there -- this is not an attempt to delay this proceeding so that
an indictment could be filed or the grand jury could be
impaneled, whatever. And that we will have a preliminary
hearing on Tuesday no matter what. And upon that representation
I stipulated that the matter may be continued until Tuesday. 

  THE COURT: Okay, you're not asking as a condition
of your stipulation that they not subsequently impanel a grand
jury and return an indictment if that's such? 

  MR. NEVIN: Yeah. No, I don't consider that to be part
of our stipulation. 

  THE COURT: All right. Mr. Ellsworth, is that agreement
adequate for you? 

  MR. ELLSWORTH: I have no problem with that agreement,
Your Honor. . . . [FN1032]

 Thereafter, Judge Boyle granted me motion to continue the
preliminary hearing until September 15. [FN1033]

  Ellsworth told investigator that when he argued this
motion he expected that the Harris preliminary hearing would
take no longer than one day. At that time, he was aware that
Magistrate Judge Williams had permitted Weaver's defense counsel
to subpoena the marshals to testify; however, Ellswroth did not
know whether Magistrate Judge Boyle, who was new on the bench,
would adopt a similar approach in the Harris preliminary hearing.
Ellsworth knew that they intended to present an indictment on 
[G.J.] [FN1035] but denied discussing with anyone or giving
serious consideration to what would occur if an indictment were
returned while the preliminary hearing was in progress. [FN1036]
Ellsworth stated that he was surprised when the defense objected
to his request and believed that they distrusted his stated
reason for the continuance. [FN1037] Ellsworth insisted that he 
did not believe that he was guaranteeing a full preliminary 
hearing. He saw no conflict between his representation and his 
knowledge that an indictment would be presented on [G.J.] since 
he thought that the hearing would take one day and, thus, would 
be over before the indictment was presented to the grand jury. 
[FN1038]

  Neither Howen nor Lindquist recall having any discussions with 
Ellsworth before he appeared in court on September 11th. [FN1039]
However, Howen believed that Ellsworth knew that the government
intended to present an indictment to the grand jury on [G.J.] 
[FN1040] and that the magistrate in the Weaver preliminary hearing 
was giving defense counsel unusually broad latitude in calling
witnesses and in permitting expanded cross-examination of the
government's witnesses. [FN1041] Furthermore, Howen told 
investigators that after the first day of the Weaver preliminary 
hearing it "was very apparent" to them that the preliminary 
hearing would be longer than a one or two day proceeding. [FN1042]

  [G.J.]

  [FN1043]

  [G.J.]

  [FN1044]

  (2) Beginning of the Harris Preliminary Hearing 

  The preliminary hearing of Harris began on September 15. 
For the first two hours, Howen argued 10 motions that the
government had filed late the previous day. [FN1045] Thereafter,
Lindquist spent the remaining part of the day conducting the
direct examination of Special Agent Gregory Rampton while Howen
left the hearing and presented witnesses before the grand jury
in another room in the courthouse. 

  At the end of the proceedings on September 15, Lindquist
informed the court that he had a scheduling conflict if the
Harris preliminary hearing continued the next day since he was
supposed to participate in the Weaver preliminary hearing. 
Lindquist explained that Howen was unavailable to conduct either
hearing because, "we have the grand jury convened, which is
going to demand his time." [FN1046] As a result, Lindquist 
requested that the Harris hearing be continued. After defense 
counsel objected to the request, [FN1047] the following colloquy 
occurred: 

  MR. NEVIN: . . . . The -- I have been concerned all
through this, that where the United States was going with a
grand jury indictment, and then an argument that would cut off
our right to have a preliminary hearing. 

  When we appeared in Court last Thursday, Mr. Ellsworth
was there, and Mr. Ellsworth was there on a motion to continue
these proceedings from yesterday until today. 

  I said at that time, that was what I was afraid they were
doing, and that if they would guarantee me that was not what
they were doing, and that we would go forward with a preliminary
hearing, no matter what, they holding it at another time was
fine with me. 

  I went outside here, and I saw grand jury witnesses going
into the grand jury room, I know that's what they are doing. 
We've been told Mr. Howen can't be here tomorrow because he's
got to appear before, and again that's a choice they have made
for him to be there instead of here. 

  But, in any event, if counsel will assure me that we will
hold and complete this preliminary hearing, I don't mind if we
continue it until a later time, and that there will be not
argument upon -- if a grand jury indictment is returned, that
we're not entitled to complete this hearing. And upon that
insurance, let's hold it another time, whenever it's convenient,
that's fine. . . . 

  MR. LINDQUIST: . . . [C]ounsel will not have that
assurance. We're all very much aware that the purpose of a
preliminary hearing does not result in a charging document. The
purpose is to get us to that grand jury, which is the
institution that initiates the charging document. . . . 

  I'm simply saying that we are proceeding with the grand
jury as it is convened, pursuant to Court order, and I'm not
going to make any commitment as to what that grand jury will do. 
That is not in my power. That's not my authority. [FN1048]

The court then asked Lindquist whether he had "visited with Mr.
Ellsworth about the nature of the hearing held last week on this
very question," to which Lindquist replied that he had "about a
two-meeting" with Ellsworth and had simply learned that defense
counsel was cynical about the reasons Ellsworth had given for
the continuance. Having ordered that the preliminary hearing
reconvene the next morning, the court explained that it was
going to "pull out the tape" of the earlier hearing because it
believed that Ellsworth had represented that "there would be a
complete preliminary hearing held in this matter." 

  d. September 16, 1992 

  (1). [G.J.] 

  [G.J.]

  [FN1050]

  [G.J.]

[FN1051] Thereafter, the grand jury deliberated and returned two
indictments against Weaver and Harris charging them with
violations of 18 U.S.C. 1. 115, 1111 and 1114. 

  Howen stated that when he presented the indictment to the
grand jury his understanding of what Ellsworth had stated in
court that previous Friday was that the continuance was
requested to accommodate the security concerns of the police and
the Secret Service and that the request was not a subterfuge to
avoid having a preliminary hearing before an indictment was
returned. He was aware of no other representations having been
made by Ellsworth. [FN1052] In addition, Howen said it was unclear
to him whether Judge Boyle was going to allow the same broad
latitude in issuing subpoenas to Harris as Judge Williams had
allowed for Weaver which would extend the length of the Harris
hearing. [FN1053]

  Ellsworth believed that before the indictment was
presented that he had briefly mentioned his September 11th
statements to Howen and Lindquist but that he had not discussed
the statements in detail including any representations he may
have made to Nevin that Harris would have a preliminary hearing. 
[FN1054] Ellsworth denied that they ever discussed that the Harris
preliminary hearing could be terminated by obtaining the return
of an indictment. However, he conceded that they did
contemplate ending the Weaver preliminary hearing in this
fashion. [FN1055]

 (2) Harris Preliminary Hearing 

  The Harris preliminary hearing resumed on September 16
with the defense examining its first witness, Deputy Marshal
Hunt. Assistant U.S. Attorney Monty Stiles handled the proceeding
while Lindquist continued to handle the Weaver preliminary hearing
and Howen was before the grand jury. [FN1056] In the middle of the
morning session, Howen interrupted the proceedings and informed 
the court that the grand jury had returned two indictments against
Weaver and Harris. [FN1057] Howen requested immediate arraignment. 
Thereafter, the court declared a 10 minute recess. When court 
resumed, Howen stated that he had not been present in court when 
certain conversations occurred between the court and Ellsworth. The 
court then took another brief recess to allow Howen to review a 
transcript of the September 11 hearing transcribed by the judge's 
secretary the previous evening. [FN1058]

  When the proceedings resumed, Judge Boyle made it clear
that he considered the initial appearance of Harris to have been
at the Spokane hospital on August 30, 1991 before Judge Imbrogno
and, therefore, that the time requirements of Fed. R. Crim. P. 
began to run from that date. [FN1059] Howen then argued that the 
case would have been indicted the prior week if the court had not
delayed the impaneling of the grand jury for one week because of
the Labor Day holiday. [FN1060] Howen then admitted that Ellsworth
"did guarantee a preliminary hearing" but argued "[w]e appeared 
for the preliminary hearing. . . . [W]e think at this time, with 
the return of the indictments. . . the preliminary hearing now
should go on to the detention hearing. . . ."  [FN1061]

  Although Judge Boyle concluded that Ellsworth had moved
for the continuance in good faith and seemed to agree that, as a
legal matter, the return of an indictment extinguished the right
to a preliminary hearing, he was concerned that the Ellsworth
representations might have estopped the government from indicting 
Harris. [FN1062] In response, Howen adopted a narrow reading
of the September 11 transcript and argued that preliminary
hearings are typically brief and that all that Ellsworth was
promising was that a preliminary hearing would be held on
September 15 [FN1063] and that because a hearing had been held on 
that day, the Government was not estopped from indicting Harris. 
[FN1064] Howen denied having any improper motive in presenting the
indictment to the grand jury and argued that because the
defendants were in custody, they had a right to immediate
presentment before a grand jury and indeed, that the Speedy
Trial Act mandated that they be brought before a grand jury
within 30 days of arrest. [FN1065]

  Defense counsel Nevin argued that this matter was not
dependent upon the statutory provisions and caselaw that held
that an indictment extinguished the right to a preliminary
hearing but rather was dependent upon the effect to be given
Harris' waiver of a right to object to a continuance in return
for a promise by the U.S. Attorney that Harris would have a
preliminary hearing. [FN1066] Nevin, pointing to the lengthy 
argument of motions and the lengthy direct examination of 
Rampton, argued that Howen had no intention of completing the 
preliminary hearing on September 15, 1992. [FN1067] He maintained
that the clear import of what was stated in court on September 
11th was that in return for Harris' consent to continuing the 
preliminary hearing the government agreed to give Harris a full 
preliminary hearing without interrupting it with the return of an 
indictment. [FN1068] Thereafter, Nevin moved to quash the 
indictment. 

  After listening to the arguments of the parties, the
court took the matter under advisement and commenced the
detention phase of the hearing. [FN1069] Thereafter, the 
government resumed its direct questioning of Special Agent 
Rampton after which defense counsel cross examined Rampton. 

  stigators found that Ellsworth had a somewhat confused
recollection of the events during this time period. He recalled
having concern after the Harris preliminary hearing proceedings
concluded on September 15 because it became apparent to him that
they would continue beyond the one day he had anticipated. It
was at that point that he recalled discussing with either Howen
or Lindquist that they might have to continue the preliminary
hearing. However, he did not remember that they ever considered
not presenting the indictment on September 16. Indeed, it was
his recollection that they decided to proceed and to deal with
any objections to the indictment that were raised. [FN1070]

  Howen told investigators that if he had been arguing the
motion on September 11, he would not have made the statements
that Ellsworth did. He attributed these statements to the fact
that Ellsworth was not the attorney responsible for litigating
the case and that he was unfamiliar with the issues in the case.
Had Howen been in court, he would have explained that, if the
court were to conduct the preliminary hearing before the
convening of the grand jury -- a schedule that Howen argued was
inconsistent with the practice in the district -- he would
present an indictment, which, if returned, would extinguish the
preliminary hearing. [FN1071] Despite his views about the 
statements made by Ellsworth, Howen stated that if had been 
provided a copy of the September 11 transcript before going 
before the grand jury it would not have changed his decision 
to present the indictment. [FN1072]

  Based on his conversations with Ellsworth, Lindquist
believed that on September 11 Ellsworth intended to agree that
Harris had a right to a preliminary hearing but not to agree
that the government could not seek an indictment that would
terminate the preliminary hearing. Lindquist thought that
Ellsworth intended to guarantee at least a partial preliminary
hearing. However, Lindquist admitted that he believed that they
"all agreed that what was communicated to [Nevin] was probably
ambigious and could easily have been interpreted as I get my
preliminary hearing from beginning to end." [FN1073]

 (3) Weaver Preliminary Hearing 

  On September 16, the preliminary hearing of Weaver
resumed. However, before defense counsel began to cross-examine
Deputy Marshal Cooper, Lindquist informed the court and defense
counsel that a grand jury had been convened and would be handing
down an indictment that day. [FN1074] Shortly thereafter, an 
indictment was served on Weaver and the court heard argument from 
the parties as to whether the preliminary hearing should be
continued. The court then permitted defense counsel to cross-
examine Cooper before ruling that the preliminary hearing was
being terminated. Judge Williams concluded that the grand
jury's finding of probable cause obviated the need for the
preliminary hearing and opined that the issue of prosecutorial
misconduct could be addressed by motion with the district court
judge. [FN1075] Thereafter, the court proceeded to the detention phase
of the proceedings. Lindquist rested after introducing a few
exhibits; defense counsel called no additional witnesses. The
court ordered that Weaver be detained. [FN1076]

 e. September 17, 1992 

  On September 17, the court ruled on the Harris motion to
quash the indictment. Judge Boyle concluded that although he
"truly believe[d]" that Ellsworth had made the request for a
continuance in good faith, he interpreted "the stipulation
entered into between counsel as contemplating that Mr. Harris
would be entitled to a preliminary examination." [FN1077] With 
regard to what legal effect should be given the breach of the 
agreement, including whether it warranted quashing the indictment,
Judge Boyle thought that the issue was better left to a 
superseding proceeding or appeal. However, he did not believe 
that Harris had been prejudiced by how the preliminary and 
detention hearings were conducted. [FN1078] The court concluded 
that the return of the indictment extinguished the need for the 
purpose of the preliminary hearing which was to determine whether
probable cause existed that a crime had been committed and that 
Harris had committed it. As a result, Judge Boyle held that the
preliminary hearing would not continue. [FN1079]

  Thereafter, the court began the detention phase of the
hearing and defense counsel proceeded to cross-examine Special
Agent Rampton. After Rampton completed his testimony, defense
counsel called and questioned Deputy Marshals Dave Hunt, Arthur
Roderick, Larry Cooper, Joseph Thomas and Francis Norris. 
Following argument by counsel, Judge Boyle ordered that Harris
be detained. [FN1080]

 f. Subsequent Defense Challenges 

  On November 16, 1992, Weaver and Harris sought to dismiss
the indictments returned against them, arguing, among other
grounds that the preliminary hearing had been improperly
terminated. They asserted that the Government improperly
obtained the indictments only after it realized that probable
cause had not been demonstrated at the preliminary hearings
because none of the witnesses offered had seen either defendant
fire the shot that killed Degan. In addition, they argued that
once the Government elected to proceed against the defendant by
preliminary hearing it should "be estopped from abandoning that
proceeding." [FN1081] To hold otherwise, in their view, would 
permit the Government to abuse the preliminary hearing, if it 
appeared that the defense might prevail, in violation of the 
due process rights of the defendants to introduce evidence. 
[FN1082] Harris also contended that dismissal was warranted in 
his case since his consent to a continuance had been secured by 
a false promise that the hearing would not be superseded by an 
indictment. [FN1083]

  The government filed its response to the Weaver and
Harris motions to dismiss on November 23, 1992 and argued that
there was no legal authority to support the proposition that it
was unconstitutional for the prosecution to have the grand jury
return an indictment while a preliminary hearing was in
progress. [FN1084] Furthermore, the Government noted that Weaver 
had requested the continuance of the preliminary hearing from 
September 11, 1992 to September 16, 1992. [FN1085] The 
Government failed to address directly Harris' argument that the 
Government had represented that an indictment would not be 
returned prior to the completion of the preliminary hearing. It 
did, however, argue that Harris had been afforded a completed 
preliminary hearing that was completed on September 17, 1992, one 
day after the indictment had been returned. [FN1086]

  Magistrate Judge Williams concluded that the U.S.
Attorney's Office had acted within the scope of the applicable
laws and was not guilty of prosecutorial misconduct. In
addition, he concluded that there was no legal barrier to an
indictment being returned prior to the completion of the
preliminary hearing. Once the indictment was returned, the need
for the probable cause determination of the preliminary hearing
became unnecessary. [FN1087]

  Shortly thereafter, Magistrate Judge Boyle ruled on the claims 
made by Harris in his Motion to Dismiss. [FN1088] In that
opinion, Judge Boyle adhered to his earlier ruling on the issue
and reiterated his conclusion that there was no legal impediment
to a grand jury returning an indictment while a preliminary
hearing was in progress. [FN1089] In addition, Judge Boyle found 
that Harris had failed to demonstrate that he had been deprived of
any constitutional or procedural right or that he had suffered
prejudice that justified dismissal of the indictment. [FN1090] 
Nowhere in his opinion did Judge Boyle address the impact of the
Ellsworth representations. 

  On January 8, 1993, Weaver and Harris filed a joint
motion in which, among other forms of relief, they sought to
dismiss the indictment. In this pleading, they repeated their
allegation that the U.S. Attorney's Office had subverted the
preliminary hearing process by securing a grand jury indictment
when it had become apparent that probable cause could not be
found at the preliminary hearing. In addition, they argued that
this alleged subversion was exacerbated in the case of Harris
since the U.S. Attorney had stated to the court that an
indictment would not be sought until the completion of the
preliminary hearing. [FN1091]

  District Court Judge Edward Lodge rejected this defense
challenge and adopted the recommended report and order of
Magistrate Judges Williams and Boyle in orders issued on
February 17, 1993. Judge Lodge repeated his rejection of the
motion to dismiss in his order addressing the motion to
disqualify the U.S. Attorney's Office from prosecuting the case. 

  3. Discussion 

  We agree with the judicial determinations in the Weaver
and Harris prosecutions that the return of an indictment in the
midst of a preliminary hearing extinguishes the right to a
preliminary hearing. The sole purpose of the preliminary
hearing is to determine whether probable cause exists to believe
that the defendant has committed the criminal conduct described
in the complaint. Once the grand jury has made an independent
determination that probable cause exists and returns an
indictment, that document becomes the charging document in the
prosecution. There is no reason for the preliminary hearing to
continue. Nor are we aware of any estoppel principle that would
restrict the government from returning an indictment while a
preliminary hearing is in progress. 

  Despite this conclusion, we are troubled by the
representations that Ellsworth made in court on September 11th,
and question whether the members of the U.S. Attorney's Office-
- especially Ellsworth -- behaved ethically in light of these
representations. Our concern is not that Ellsworth fabricated
the need for a continuance since the record is uncontradicted
that law enforcement personnel had articulated the security
problems created by the trial and the Quayle visit. Rather, our
concern is directed at two other areas. First, whether the
statements that Ellsworth made constituted a guarantee that
Harris would have a "full" or "complete" preliminary hearing in
return for agreeing to a continuance and, if such a
representation was made, did Ellsworth make it with the intent
to promise a complete preliminary hearing. [FN1092] Second, 
whether Howen or Lindquist understood that Ellsworth had made 
such a representation before the indictment was presented to 
the grand jury. 

  Focusing on the first issue, an examination of the
September 11 transcript reveals clearly that defense counsel
Nevin was concerned that if the preliminary hearing were
continued, the prosecution might obtain an indictment and
terminate the hearing. Thereafter, there was an exchange among
Nevin, Ellsworth and the court in which the agreement of the
parties was formed. Ellsworth insisted that he had not ulterior
motive for the request and stated that "I am willing to give
assurances that we intend to have a preliminary hearing . . . ." 
[FN1093] Nevin said that he would have no objection to the 
continuance "if what counsel if saying is that there is going to 
be a preliminary hearing on Tuesday no matter what. . . ." [FN1094]
Ellsworth responded that "[t]he government has no problem with that
stipulation." The court then proceeded to ensure that the
parties understood the terms of the agreement. Nevin agreed
that he was agreeing to continue the preliminary hearing on the
representation that Ellsworth was making the motion simply to
honor the requests of the chief of police, that Ellsworth was
not making the request to permit his office time to present an
indictment to the grand jury and that Ellsworth was providing a
guarantee that Harris would have a preliminary hearing on
September 15. Nevin agreed that the agreement did not include a
promise that the USAO would not subsequently impanel a grand
jury and return an indictment. In response, Ellsworth told the
court that he had "no problem" with the terms of the agreement. 
[FN1095]

  Critical to this issue is what did Ellsworth intend or
believe he was promising when he entered into this agreement on
September 11, 1992. The defense argued that he was promising a
"full" preliminary hearing. In contrast, Ellsworth and Howen
seem to believe that Ellsworth never promised a "full"
preliminary hearing but rather "a" hearing or "some" preliminary
hearing would be held on September 15. Ellsworth stated that he
believed that the hearing could be completed in one day. Both
men did not believe that any guarantees had been given that, if
the preliminary hearing took longer than one day, that an
indictment would not be returned. 

  If we were to strictly construe the meaning of the words
used by the parties, it is true that the word "full" or its
functional equivalent was never uttered in court. However, we
are uncomfortable with the hypertechnicality of such an
approach. We believe that implicit in a request for a promise
of "a" preliminary hearing is the idea of a full rather than a
partial preliminary hearing. Indeed, when first confronted with
the statements that Ellsworth made, Howen stated to the court,
"[w]e think, in good faith, the United States Attorney, with the
-- with the transcript I have here, did guarantee a preliminary
hearing. [FN1096] The remarks of the court echoed this view. 
[FN1097] In its initial ruling on this issue, the Court concluded 
that the stipulation "contemplate[ed] that Mr. Harris would be 
entitled to a preliminary examination." [FN1098]

  Having concluded that a fair interpretration of the
language used by Ellsworth was to promise a complete preliminary
hearing we must proceed to our next area of inquiry which is
what did Ellsworth intend when he made these representations in
court. Ellsworth insisted that it was never his intent to
guarantee that Harris would have a complete preliminary hearing
but rather only to represent that there would be "a" preliminary
hearing on September 15. [FN1099] A careful review of the evidence
does not convice us otherwise. Thus, we cannot conclude that
Ellsworth intended to guarantee Harris a full preliminary
hearing. 

  Despite this conclusion, we are concerned by the actions
of Ellsworth. At the outset, we are troubled by the
insensitivity or misunderstanding that he demonstrated
concerning the impact of his September 11 statements. Ellsworth
failed to appreciate the effect given to his words because they
were uttered by someone in the position of the U.S. Attorney. 
We are also concerned about the apparent failure of Ellsworth to
carefully and continually evaluate all of the information
available to him. The evidence establishes that Ellsworth knew
on September 11 that Howen would be seeking an indictment when
the grand jury convened on [G.J.]. It also appears that
Ellsworth may have participated in discussions concerning the
possibility that an indictment could be returned while the
preliminary hearing was in progress and that the legal effect of
this action would be to extinguish the preliminary hearing. 
Finally, it seems probable that Ellsworth also was aware that
judicial rulings in the Weaver preliminary hearing had permitted
the defense board latitude in calling witnesses to testify in
the preliminary hearing thereby transforming it from a summary
proceeding into a longer hearing and that the potential existed 
that the Harris hearing might be similarly handled. Although
this information was available to Ellsworth, there was no
indication that he carefully evaluated it when considering the
timing of the Harris indictment. Thus, despite our inability to
comfortable conclude that Ellsworth intentionally misrepresented
the nature of the government's agreement, we believe that his
inattention to the clear import of his words coupled with his
failure to monitor the progress of the Harris preliminary
hearing and the timing of the presentment of the indictment came
precipitously close to unethical conduct. 

  The investigative record failed to develop evidence
establishing that Howen or Lindquist understood the scope of
what Ellsworth had arguably promised in court on September 11. 
Based on their remarks to the court and to us, both men, prior
to the time when the indictment was returned, appeared to have
been under the impression that the main issue discusses in court
was whether the security concerns articulated by Ellsworth
constituted a fabricated excuse designed to give the government
more time in which to secure an indictment. [FN1100] From his 
remarks to the court on September 15, Lindquist did not seem to see
Ellsworth's statements as providing a guarantee that there would
be a preliminary hearing but rather only as an indication that
they intended to proceed with the preliminary hearing on that
date. 

  However, we are concerned about the events after the
court session on September 15. Based on a reading of the
transcript of the proceeding, we find it difficult to believe
that Mr. Lindquist did not realize at the end of that day that a
serious issue had developed over the representations that
Ellsworth had made four days earlier. Indeed, we believe that
Lindquist may have raised his concern to Howen because 

  [G.J.] 

[FN1101] It appears that neither Howen or Lindquist ever considered
or discussed the need to evaluate the impact of the Ellsworth
statements before resuming the grand jury proceedings. We think
that the potential implications of these statements were
apparent and, thus, we would have expected some discussion to
have occurred about the impact of indicting Harris while the
preliminary hearing was still in progress. 

  As a practical matter we do not believe that Harris was
prejudiced by this controversy since he was allowed to question
witnesses during the detention phase of the proceeding that he
would have probably called to testify at the preliminary hearing
if had been allowed to continue. [FN1102] Rather, what concerns us 
is the appearance of impropriety created when Mr. Ellsworth, as the
U.S. Attorney, made statements that reasonable indicated that a
promise of a preliminary hearing was being made and then
supervised actions that appeared to violate that promise. 
Moreover, we are also concerned that this situation may have
been attributable in part to the failure of Mr. Ellsworth to
have thoroughly evaluated and monitored the information
available to him before and after his appearance in court on
September 11th. 

  4. Conclusion 

  We conclude that a reasonable interpretation of the
language that Ellsworth used in court on September 11, 1991 was
that Mr. Harris would have a full preliminary hearing. Although
the government never promised that an indictment would not be
returned it created the impression upon which the defense relied
that such a return would not occur until the preliminary hearing
had been completed. We do not believe that Mr. Ellsworth
intentionally misrepresented the position of the government yet
we do conclude that he gave insufficient consideration to the
information available to him and to the plain meaning of his
statements. Finally, the evidence does not sustain the charge
that before the indictment was presented to the grand jury that
Howen and Lindquist believed that Ellsworth had guaranteed a
complete preliminary hearing to Harris. We find no misconduct
by them in this matter.

grand jury for the District of Idaho would meed [G.J.]
                    but could not do so in September 1992 because
of delay caused by the Labor Day holiday and the need to swear in
a new grand jury.  If this delay had not occurred, the grand jury
would have met on  [G.J.]     and returned the indictment before
the preliminary hearing had begun.  It was the Government's
contention that the defense had attempted to manipulate the
preliminary hearing proceedings so as "to frustrate and prevent
the orderly receipt of evidence and testimony by the Grand Jury" 
and that its request for a remand for further preliminary hearing
was no more that a discovery device since they has been unable to
satisfy the deposition requirements of Fed. R. Crim P. 15. Id. at

preliminary hearing by securing an indictment."  Standard
3.3.10(d), ABA Standards for Criminal Justice (1992).  Although
the Department of Justice has not adopted the ABA Standards as
official policy of the Department, it recommends all U.S.
Attorneys to familiarize themselves with the standards since the
courts use the standards with addressing matters presented to
them.  United States Attorney's Manual, 9-2.102.

     1097. For example, at the proceedings on September 15th,
after Lindquist informed the court of his scheduling problems,
defense counsel Nevin reiterated his concern about the grand jury
returning an indictment.  When Lindquist asserted that he could
not assure Nevin that Harris would have a complete preliminary
hearing uninterrupted by an indictment, the court inquired
whether Lindquist had "visited with Mr. Ellsworth about the
nature of the hearing held last week on this very question." 
Later the court stated that it was going to review that tape of
the hearing that evening because he thought that "there was some
representation that there would be a complete preliminary hearing
held in this matter."  Id. 228-233.

     1098. Id., September 17, 1992, at 4.  During their
discussions with investigators, Lindquist agreed that the words
uttered by Ellsworth were ambiguous while Ellsworth conceded that
one could have concluded from his words that he was guaranteeing
a full preliminary hearing.  Ellsworth Interview, Tape 3, at 43. 
Lindquist Interview, Tape 1, at 31-32.

     1099. Ellsworth Interview, Tape 3, at 43.

     1100. Later, when asked to interpret the September 11
statements that Ellsworth made, both Howen and Lindquist
interpreted them as promising "some" preliminary hearing but not
a "full" preliminary hearing.  For the reasons already discussed
we do not agree  with this interpretation of the record. 
Although we find these interpretations of the Ellsworth
statements by Howen and Lindquist to be somewhat disingenuous we
do not attribute these explanations to any bad motive on their
parts but rather on an understandable desire to defend a
colleague who they believe made ambiguous statements buy did not
do so in bad faith.

     1101. [G.J.]

     1102. Members of the U.S. Attorneys Office reject Harris'
argument that he relinquished a valuable right by consenting to
the continuance since, if Harris had withheld his consent, they
would have simply proceeded with preliminary hearing as
scheduled.  See, e.g., Lindquist Interview, Tape 1, at 30. This
argument, in our view, misses the mark and overlooks the negative
impact created by the U.S. Attorney making representatives and
then failing to honor them.

IV. SPECIFIC ISSUES INVESTIGATED

 L. Scope of the Indictment and Alleged Prosecutorial Misconduct
Before the Grand Jury 

  1. Introduction 

  Following Weaver's surrender, the prosecution presented a
series of charges against him and Harris to a grand jury on
[G.J.]. An indictment was returned on September 16, charging
the defendants with the murder of Deputy Marshal Degan and with
an assault on Degan and Deputy Marshals Roderick and Cooper. 
[FN1103]

  [G.J.], which returned a superseding indictment on
October 1 that included a broad charge of conspiracy by Weaver
and Harris. [FN1104]

  [G.J.], which returned a second superseding indictment on
November 19, setting forth essentially the same charge contained
in the October 1 indictment. [FN1105]

  On January 8, 1993, counsel for Weaver and Harris filed
pretrial motions to dismiss the superseding indictment, in part,
because of alleged prosecutorial misconduct that occurred during
the grand jury proceedings between September 16 and October 1. 
The defense claimed that Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen
made improper statements to the grand jury, which were the
equivalent of unsworn testimony, and that Howen had elicited
irrelevant and protracted testimony regarding the violent
criminal activities of white supremacist groups known as the
Aryan Nations, Order 1 and Order 2. Defense counsel asserted
that this evidence was introduced to inflame the grand jury and
prejudice it against Weaver and Harris. [FN1106]

  Weaver's counsel also alleged at trial and to this
investigation that the conspiracy charged in Count 1 of both
superseding indictments was overly broad in that it covered a
period beginning in January 1983 and continuing through August
31, 1992. During this investigation, members of the FBI also
argued that the scope of the indictment was too broad and should
not have included the conspiracy count. Furthermore, defense
counsel claimed that the government brought certain charges in
the superseding indictments, for which there was no factual
basis. 

  In addition to these allegations, we have also considered
whether the prosecution improperly limited the scope of the
grand jury's investigation to crimes committed by Weaver and
Harris and precluded a broader inquiry into possible crimes
committed by law enforcement officers in the shooting of Vicki
Weaver. [FN1107] Finally we have examined the propriety of the 
decision of the government to seek the death penalty in the 
Weaver case. 

  2. Statement of Facts 

   a. Scope of the Indictment: The Conspiracy Count
Count 1 of both superseding indictments alleged the existence of
a wide-ranging conspiracy among "Randall C. Weaver, Vicki
Weaver, Kevin L. Harris and others known and unknown to the
Grand Jury, including some other members of the Weaver family,"
beginning from the time Weaver moved his family from Iowa to
Idaho in 1983 and continuing through Weaver's surrender to
authorities on August 31, 1992. The prosecution's theory was
that the Weavers and Harris had long planned a violent
confrontation with law enforcement, a plan that came to fruition
on August 21, 1992, when Harris killed Deputy Marshal Degan. 
[FN1108]

  Weaver's counsel accused the prosecution of "engaging in
the 'demonizaiton'" of Randy Weaver by adding the conspiracy
count to the original indictment. Defense counsel alleged that
the conspiracy count was used to justify the introduction of
inflammatory and prejudicial evidence at trial. [FN1109]

  Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen had prosecuted a number of
Aryan Nations and related cases and was well acquainted with the
racist beliefs, violent philosophy, and anti-government sentiments
held by those associated with such groups. [FN1110] Among
these groups were the Order 1 and the Order 2, which had carried
out a series of robberies and bombings in the Northwest in the
mid-1980s. [FN1111] Early in the Weaver investigation, Howen 
noticed similarities between the views expressed by the Weavers 
and those espoused by members of the Aryan Nations and the 
Orders. [FN1112] Howen learned that, in a 1983 newspaper 
interview, Weaver had discussed plans to move from Iowa to 
Northern Idaho to live in an isolated hideaway and "survive the 
coming 'great tribulation.'" The article stated that Weaver was 
"developing defense plans that include[d] a 300 yard 'kill zone' 
encircling [his] compound." [FN1113]

  Howen decided to pattern the charges against Weaver and
Harris after indictments he had used in Aryan Nations cases.
[G.J.] [FN1114]

 [G.J.] 

 [FN1115]

  Assistant U.S. Attorney Lindquist, who helped Howen draft
the indictment, told this investigation that he and Howen knew
that they would have to address the death of Vicki Weaver in the
government's case. He reasoned that it would be strategically
wiser to acknowledge the events of August 22 forthrightly at
trial than to permit the defense to use the government's failure
to mention these events to their advantage with the jury. [FN1116]

  Howen and Lindquist also feared that the trial court
would not allow the prosecution to introduce evidence of the
Weavers' past conduct to prove their intent to provoke a violent
confrontation with law enforcement officials, unless that
conduct was included in the indictment. [FN1117] They, therefore, 
sought to establish that Randy Weaver, his family, and Kevin 
Harris had formed a conspiracy to resist the U.S. Government 
and to assault government and to assault government agents and 
that the conspiracy began to take shape in Iowa as far back as 
1983. [FN1118]  The objects of the conspiracy were set forth in
the indictment:

 1. To forcibly resist, oppose, impede, interfere with,
intimidate, assault and/or otherwise cause a violent
confrontation with law enforcement authorities in the engagement
in or on account of the performance of their official duties of
enforcing the laws of the United States. . . as to said Randall
C. Weaver, Vicki Weaver, Kevin L. Harris and others; 

 2. To purchase, develop and maintain a remote mountain
residence/stronghold; 

 3. To illegally and otherwise make, possess, sell and/or conceal
firearms and ammunition; 

 4. To fail to appear for trial on pending federal criminal
charges after orally and in writing agreeing to appear for trial
before a federal judge; 

 5. To hinder or prevent the discovery, apprehension, arrest and
trial of federal fugitives from justice; 

 6. To steal, conceal, retain and/or convert the personal
property of others to their own use; 

 7. To intimidate neighbors, as well as law enforcement officers
and agents, by the use, display, threat to use and/or discharge
of firearms; 

 8. To use, display, threaten to use, fire and/or discharge
firearms at or near human beings, vehicles and/or aircraft; and 

 9. To assault, shoot, wound, kill and/or murder, or threaten to
cause such to occur. . . by means of the use of deadly weapons.
. . . [FN1119]

  The proposed conspiracy count initially listed 28 overt
acts, including the 1983 newspaper interview, the Weavers' move
to Idaho in 1983, the shooting death of Deputy Marshal Degan,
and an attempt to take offensive action against a helicopter,
which resulted in the death of Vicki Weaver. An additional 14
overt acts were added to the second superseding indictment. 

  The U.S. Attorney's Office in Idaho did not have a formal
review process for indictments. [FN1120] That office also did 
not require a prosecution memorandum for evaluating proposed
indictments. However, Howen did discuss the superseding
indictment with Ellsworth, who approved the conspiracy count. 

  Howen and Lindquist also discussed the proposed
conspiracy count with representatives of the Marshals Service,
BATF, the FBI, and the Department of Justice. They received
conflicting opinions as to the wisdom of including such a count. 
Henry Hudson, Director of the U.S. Marshals Service during the
Weaver/Harris prosecution, spent several hours reviewing the
indictment and believed that the conspiracy count detracted from
the most significant charge which was the murder of Deputy
Marshal Degan. [FN1121]

 [GARRITY] 

 [FN1122] FBI case agents Venkus and Rampton also disagreed 
with the conspiracy theory. [FN1123]

 [GARRITY] 

 [FN1124]

  None of the counts charged in the indictment required
review or approval by the Department of Justice. Nonetheless,
Howen sought input from the Department. James Reynolds, Chief
of the Criminal Division's Terrorism and Violent Crimes Section,
and Deputy Section Chief Dana Biehl had reservations about the
manner in which the indictment had been drawn. However, since
DOJ had no supervisory control over the case, they did not seek
to impose their views on the prosecution. [FN1125]

  b. Evidential Support for Certain Overt Acts and
Substantive Offenses 

  Defense counsel, both in pretrial motions and in an
interview with this inquiry, claimed that "a great majority" of
the overt acts alleged in the indictment as part of the
conspiracy count were without evidentiary support and should not
have been charged. [FN1126] The defense also complained that many
of the overt acts were not, in themselves, criminal or had no 
relation to the object of the conspiracy. 

  The defense asserted in pretrial motions that Count 1 of
the indictment, which charged a wide ranging conspiracy, forced
them to defend against "alleged crimes that are irrelevant to
the case." [FN1127] The overt acts challenged included those set 
forth in the following paragraphs of the second indictment: 

 7. On or about May 6, 1985, Randall C. Weaver and Vicki Weaver
mailed a letter addressed to the President of the United States
and the . . . United States Secret Service; . . . . 

 32. On or about April 18, 1992, Randall C. Weaver, Vicki Weaver,
or Kevin L. Harris shot at or near a helicopter and its
occupants; . . . . 

 36. On or about May 2, 1992, Randall C. Weaver and Kevin L.
Harris stole a video camera and other equipment, later
destroying it or converting it to their own use; . . . . 

 38. On or about August 3, 1992, Randall C. Weaver, Vicki Weaver,
Kevin L. Harris and/or some other members of the Weaver family
stole a water tank and pipe belonging to another; 

 39. On or about August 17, 1992, Kevin L. Harris and/or some
other members of the Weaver family attempted to enter a
residence occupied by another and took or attempted to take the
personal property of others; . . . . 

 41. On or about August 22, 1992, Randall C. Weaver or Kevin L.
Harris and an unidentified female, probably Vicki or Sara
Weaver, took offensive action against a helicopter and its
occupants, including attempting to shoot at the helicopter,
resulting in the death of Vicki Weaver and the wounding of Kevin
L. Harris and Randall C. Weaver. . . . [FN1128]

  The defense also claimed that there was no evidence to
support the allegation that Randy Weaver shot Deputy Marshall
Degan on August 21, 1992 and fired at the other marshals. The
trial court adopted the finding of Magistrate Judge Boyle, who
ruled that the overt acts complained of were relevant to the
defendants' role in the conspiracy and that statements, acts,
and threats of violence against other bore upon issues such as
premeditation and malice. [FN1130]

  The court dismissed Counts 6 and 8 on the defendants'
motion at the conclusion of the prosecution's case-in-chief. 
Count 6, which charged Weaver and Harris with assaulting federal
officers in a helicopter on August 22, 1992, was dismissed
because the court found no evidence that the officers knew of
the assault. The court considered this knowledge to be an
element of the offense. Count 8, which charged the receipt and
possession of firearms by a fugitive, was dismissed because the
court found no proof that Randy Weaver had travelled across
state lines, as is required by the statute under which the crime
had been charged.

 f. Decision to Seek the Death Penalty 

  Count 5 of the second superseding indictment charged
Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris with the murder of Deputy U.S.
Marshal William Degan while he was "engaged in or on account of
the performance of his official duties." [FN1176] Section 1111 
of Title 18, provides for a sentence of death or life imprisonment
upon conviction for the murder of a federal officer. 

  Department of Justice policy requires the approval of the
Department's Criminal Division before a U.S. Attorney may
recommend application of the death penalty. [FN1177] Although the
prosecution did not request permission to try the Weaver matter
as a capital case for several months, the trial court considered
it a potential death-penalty case from the time the first
indictment was returned charging Weaver and Harris with Degan's
murder. The Court advised both defendants at their arraignments
that the maximum penalty for conviction on that count was death
and, as a consequence, gave them additional appointed counsel, 
increased the compensation given to counsel, and provided for
additional investigative expenses. [FN1178]

  On January 8, 1993, the defense filed a motion claiming
that the possible penalties for Count 5 could not, under the
Constitution, include the death penalty. The defense argued
that the capital punishment provision of 18 U.S.C. 1111 had
been invalidated by virtue of the Supreme Court's decision in
Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972) and subsequent rulings by
the Ninth Circuit. [FN1179] The prosecution responded that the 
capital provision of section 1111 was still viable and that the 
Court could fashion standards for its application that met the
requirements of Furman. [FN1180] The prosecution's response 
recognized that this position had been rejected by the Fifth 
Circuit and by the District of Alaska. [FN1181]

  While the decision on the defense motion was pending,
U.S. Attorney Ellsworth applied to the Terrorism and Violent
Crime Section of the Criminal Division of the Department of
Justice for authorization to seek the death penalty. As
justification for the request, Ellsworth wrote: 

 [T]he mutual premeditation [of Weaver and Harris], founded in
racial bigotry and baseless hatred for authority, is cold and
heinous in its direction at law enforcement. . . . The death of
[Deputy Marshal] Degan was the direct and planned result of
Weaver's selfish and monstrous proclamation that "[t]he tyrant's
blood will flow." His legal and moral accountability fully
supports imposition of the death penalty. [FN1182]

  The Terrorism and Violent Crimes Section recommended
against Ellsworth's request because it did not think that the
death penalty would survive a constitutional challenge under the
statute. James Reynolds, Chief of the Terrorism and Violent
Crimes Section, also had doubts about the seriousness of the
U.S. Attorney's request. [FN1183]

   The application was transmitted to Associate
Deputy Attorney General David Margolis, who believed that the
killing of a federal law enforcement officer warranted the death
penalty and that the penalty was constitutional as applied under
the statute. However, he also shared Reynolds' reservations
about the seriousness of the U.S. Attorney's intentions and
thought it was possible the U.S. Attorney was "going through the
motions." [FN1184] Margolis then telephoned Ellsworth and spoke 
with him and Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen. They assured Margolis 
that the case was sound and that they were seriously pursuing the
death penalty in this matter. [FN1185]

  Thereafter, Margolis discussed the matter with Deputy
Assistant Attorney General John C. Keeney. Both men were swayed
by the serious nature of the charge, and they decided to approve
the request to seek the death penalty. [FN1186] In making the 
decision, Margolis recognized that guilt would have to be 
proven beyond a reasonable doubt before the death penalty could 
be invoked. [FN1187] Ellsworth was given formal permission to 
seek the death penalty through a letter from the Acting Attorney 
General. [FN1188]

  Shortly thereafter, on February 26, 1993, the trial court
issued an order adopting the defense's position that the death
penalty provision of 18 U.S.C. 1111 was void under Furman and
Ninth Circuit precedent. [FN1189]

  3. Discussion 

   a. Scope of the Indictment: The Conspiracy Count 

  It would be illogical and unfair to infer from the trial
jury's verdict of acquittal on the conspiracy count that the
prosecution's theory was wholly unfounded or wrongfully
contrived. We have found no evidence that the prosecution acted
without a good faith belief that sufficient proof existed to
support the conspiracy charge, notwithstanding the often harsh
accusations made by the defense before and during trial. That
does not mean, however, that it was prudent to extend the scope
of the conspiracy to 1983. 

  Howen and Lindquist were concerned that, without a
conspiracy charge, they would not be permitted to introduce
evidence of the Weavers' past statements and conduct to explain
the events leading up to the shooting on August 21, 1992. Count
2 of the indictment charged that the earliest substantive
offense committed by Weaver, the sale of two sawed-off shotguns,
occurred in October 1989. The BATF informant involved in that
transaction first met Weaver at the World Aryan Congress in
1986, and there were tape recordings of conversations involving
Weaver and the informant beginning in January 1987. Evidence of
the circumstances under which the informant met Weaver would
almost certainly be admitted, even without a conspiracy charge,
especially since the defense claimed that Weaver had been
entrapped into making the sales. Likewise, letters and
statements following Weaver's arrest on the weapons charge in
January 1991 showing that Weaver would not submit to authorities
would have been admissible with regard to Count 3, which
charged Weaver with failure to appear for trial. 

  On the other hand, by describing the conspiracy as
beginning in 1983, the prosecution was able to introduce
evidence of the interview, in which Weaver discussed plans to
move from Iowa to Northern Idaho and develop a "300 yard 'kill
zone'" around his house. This was a key element of the
conspiracy theory. 

  Many of the criticisms of the conspiracy theory are
legitimate. For instance, 

  [G.J.] 

  [FN1190]

  [G.J.] However, at trial, the defense effectively
attacked the theory, claiming that the Government was trying to
"demonize" Weaver by charging that everything he did proved that
he hated the Government. [FN1191] Allegations that acts such as 
moving to Idaho and building a cabin were proof of a conspiracy 
clearly had the capacity to distract the trial jury from the 
killing of Deputy Marshal Degan. 

  As for the defense claim that many of the overt acts
charged in the conspiracy count were without evidential support,
the magistrate denied the defense motion to dismiss the
indictment after considering whether the allegations about which
the defense had complained were "relevant to the charge
contained in the indictment and [were] inflammatory and
prejudicial." [FN1192] We have made the same inquiry. 

  Overt Act 7 refers to two letters written by Randy and
Vicki Weaver on May 6, 1985, [FN1193] which allegedly contain 
threats made by Randy Weaver against former President Reagan. 
Deputy Boundary County Sheriff Ekstrom testified that the U.S. 
Secret Service had investigated Randy Weaver in February 1985. 
Shortly thereafter, on February 28, 1985, the Weavers filed a
handwritten affidavit with the Boundary County Clerk, claiming
that certain persons were conspiring to place Weaver and his
family in danger and to precipitate an attack on his life. The
affidavit alleged that his "accusers" made false statements
about his connections with the Aryan Nations, his ownership of
illegal weapons, and threats he allegedly made against the
President and the Pope. Weaver wrote that the plot was designed
to provoke the FBI into storming his home. He also expressed
the fear that he would be killed or arrested for assaulting a
federal officer, if he tried to defend himself. The affidavit
stated: "I make legal and official notice that I believe I may
have to defend myself and my family from physical attack on my
life."  [FN1194]

  We agree that the Secret Service investigation and the
February 1985 affidavit were relevant to whether Weaver planned
a violent confrontation with law enforcement. However, we do
not believe that the letters written in May 1985 were relevant
to the issue. One letter was an apology to President Reagan, in
which Weaver claimed that his neighbors had sent the President a
threatening letter under his name. The other letter demanded a
written apology from the Secret Service for falsely accusing him
of making the threats. [FN1195] Neither letter appears to have 
furthered the overall conspiracy. 

  Overt Act 32 alleged that a helicopter with a television
crew had been shot at as it flew near the Weaver residence. 
When the first superseding indictment was presented to the grand
jury, the prosecution had evidence that no shots had been fired
at the helicopter. [FN1196]

  [G.J.] 

 [FN1197]  The failure of the prosecution to do either is
significant. The justification given by the FBI sniper for
shooting at Randy Weaver on August 22, 1992 was that he believed
that Weaver and Harris were preparing to shoot at an FBI 
helicopter flying nearby. [FN1198] Evidence that Weaver and 
Harris had fired at a helicopter earlier would certainly have 
tended to bolster the sniper's testimony. The grand jury was 
entitled to a balanced view of the alleged incident. 

  [G.J.] 

  [FN1199]

  [G.J.] 

[FN1200] We find that this evidence was pertinent to at least one
of the objectives of the unlawful agreement alleged in the
conspiracy count: "hinder[ing] or prevent[ing] the discovery,
apprehension, arrest and trial of federal fugitives from
justice." Overt Act 36 was thus properly included in the
indictment. 

  We also conclude there was adequate evidence to support
the inclusion of Overt Acts 38 and 39, which alleged the theft
of property belonging to the Rau family. 

 [FN1201]

 [G.J.]

 [FN1202]

 [FN1203]

  As noted above, one of the objectives of the unlawful
agreement alleged in the conspiracy count was "[t]o steal,
conceal, retain and/or convert the personal property of others." 
Evidence regarding the theft of the Raus' property bore on that
allegation. [FN1204] Moreover, the Weavers' harassment of the 
Raus was a factor in the marshals' decision to resume 
surveillance of the Weaver property in August 1992. It was not 
improper to include these allegations in the indictment. 

  In regard to the charge in Overt Act 41 that Randy
Weaver, Kevin Harris, "and an unidentified female, probably
Vicki or Sara Weaver" attempted to shoot at an FBI helicopter,
Special Agent Hoiruchi testified that he saw three persons run
out of the Weaver cabin upon hearing the helicopter, one of whom
he identified as Kevin Harris. [G.J.] The prosecution knew full
well when Overt Act 41 was drafted that Vicki Weaver had been
killed while holding open the door of the cabin for the three
persons who had responded to the helicopter, one of whom was a
female. Even though Horiuchi could not identify the female, the
prosecution had abundant evidence that Vicki Weaver had not run
outside. Naming Vicki Weaver as one of the people who might
have responded to the helicopter could readily be interpreted as
an attempt to assert that Horiuchi was justified in shooting
her. It was careless and wrong for the indictment to charge
than "an unidentified female, probably Vicki or Sara Weaver"
took offensive action against the helicopter. [FN1205]

  The prosecution never contended that Randy Weaver shot
Degan, but it did assert that Weaver, Harris, and the other
family members engaged in joint criminal activity that included
murder, conspiracy, and assault on the marshals. 

  [FN1206]

  [G.J.] 

  [FN1207]

  Although Overt Act 40 does not specifically state that
Weaver was being charged as an aider and abetter, the section of
the conspiracy count defining the roles of the participants
states that Weaver "committed the crimes of aiding and abetting
murder and attempted murder." [FN1208] Count 5, which corresponds 
with Overt Act 40, also alleges that "Kevin L. Harris, as aided,
counseled, induced or procured by Randall C. Weaver . . . did .
. . shoot, kill and murder one William F. Degan. . . ." It is
also evident that Weaver was charged as an aider and abetter in
Count 5 with respect to shots fired at the other marshals during
the confrontation at the Y. 

  [G.J.] 

  [FN1209]

  We believe that several of the overt acts discussed above
should not have been included in the indictment. This appears
to have been the result of overzealousness, or perhaps poor
judgment, but not malice, on the part of the prosecution. 
However, the allegation that Randy Weaver was the moving force
behind the violent confrontation that caused Kevin Harris to
shoot at the four marshals, killing William Degan, was amply
supported by evidence presented to the grand jury. 

  We have found no intent of behalf of the prosecution to
charge Counts 6 and 8 knowing there was insufficient proof of
the elements of those offenses. Howen acknowledged to this
inquiry that a more thorough researching of these statutes would
have spared the government judicial dismissal of the counts. 
[FN1210] However, we find no impropriety in the charging of these 
counts. [FN1211] The conspiracy theory presented by the prosecution 
undoubtedly had the capacity to distract the trial jury from the 
killing of Deputy Marshal Degan. That is not to say that the 
prosecutors would have avoided acquittals by charging the case 
differently. The defense focused heavily on the arguments that 
Randy Weaver had been entrapped into making the weapons sale to 
the BATF informant, that firing at the marshals was an act of self
defense, and that there was no justification for the shooting of
Sammy and Vicki Weaver. We cannot assume that this approach
would have failed, had the case been prosecuted solely on the
murder charge and a few other substantive offenses. The case
would be difficult, no matter how it was charged. 

  We believe that some of the prosecution's difficulties
could have been avoided by a more formal review of the
indictment within the U.S. Attorney's office. The conspiracy
theory was not seriously tested until after the indictment had
been returned. In a case of this complexity, it would have been
advisable for the office to have a written prosecution
memorandum for discussion before seeking an indictment. 

  b. [G.J.] 

  [Editor's Note: Footnotes 1212 to 1217 were omitted here as 
were pages 366 to 367.]

  It is not improper for a prosecutor to express an opinion
as to the merits of the case "as long as it is clear to the jury
that the opinion is based only on the evidence that is before
the jury and the jury itself can evaluate." [FN1219] We have found
certain instances when Howen's comments went beyond explanation
or summaries of the evidence and bordered on statements of
personal knowledge. Howen's questioning of [G.J.] 

  [G.J.]

  [FN1220]

  [FN1221]

  [G.J.]

  [FN1222]

  [FN1223]

  [G.J.]

  [FN1224]

  [FN1225]

  Prosecutors are accorded wide latitude in presenting
their cases to the grand jury. [FN1226] However, although the 
prosecutor "properly has wide discretion in grand jury 
proceedings . . .this discretion is not boundless." [FN1227]

  The Department of Justice has set forth general standards
of conduct for prosecutors before the grand jury: 

 In his/her dealings with the grand jury, the prosecutor must
always conduct himself/herself as an officer of the court whose
function is to insure that justice is done and that guilt shall
not escape nor innocence suffer. He/she must recognize that the
grand jury is an independent body, whose functions include not
only the investigation of crime and the initiation of criminal
prosecution but also the protection of the citizenry from
unfounded criminal charges. The prosecutor's responsibility is
to advise the grand jury on the law and to present evidence for
its consideration. In discharging these responsibilities,
he/she must be scrupulously fair to all witnesses and must do
nothing to inflame or otherwise improperly influence the grand
jurors. [FN1228]

  The court's pretrial ruling that there was no misconduct
regarding the presentation of evidence concerning the Aryan
Nations and the Order is not conclusive for purposes of this
inquiry. We agree, [G.J.] that some background on [G.J.] was
important to put in context the tape recordings of Weaver and
the BATF informant and to define words and phrases used in those
conversations. [FN1229] Howen had been permitted to introduce 
similar evidence in past Aryan Nations prosecutions, and those 
convictions had been affirmed on appeal. [FN1230] We also 
recognize the need to clarify Vicki Weaver's citation to 
"Mathews" in a letter to the U.S. Attorney. However, we believe 
that the volume of evidence presented [G.J.] went beyond that 
which was necessary to accomplish those goals. [FN1231] For 
instance, [G.J.] 

  Other examples of problematic testimony abound. 

  [G.J.] [FN1232] Unless it is relevant to the offenses under the
investigation, comments linking the accused to a criminal class
are also inappropriate. [FN1234] It is generally improper to 
elicit testimony deliberately on irrelevant and prejudicial 
matters. [FN1234]

  [G.J.] 

  Such expressions serve no legitimate purpose, other than
to suggest to the grand jurors that the prosecutor, as an expert
in cases like the one before them, should be accorded particular
credibility. That is not a fitting posture for a prosecutor to
assume. 

  [G.J.] 

  [FN1235]

  [FN1236]

  [FN1237]

  c. [G.J.] 

  The United States Attorneys' Manual provides that the
prosecutor is "to advise the grand jury on the law and to
present evidence for its consideration." [FN1238] Instructions 
on the law must be accurate and not deliberately misleading. 
[FN1239] Although an indictment returned "by a legally 
constituted and unbiased grand jury" is presumed valid, [FN1240] 
an indictment may be subject to challenge, if the prosecutor's 
instructions are so flagrantly erroneous that the grand jury is 
deceived in some significant way. [FN1241]

  [G.J.] 

  [FN1242]

  [G.J.] 

  [FN1243]

  [G.J.]

  [FN1244]

  [FN1245]

 Rather, we attribute this failure in part to an institutional
weakness existing between the USAO and the FBI. The prosecutors
knew that the FBI had conducted an internal inquiry into the
shooting and that the FBI had concluded that the shooting was
within established rules and regulations. Such findings are
not, as a routine matter, subject to examination by prosecutors
or persons outside the FBI. Thus, the FBI considered the issue
closed and resisted any act or inquiry which could be
interpreted as challenging the actions of the HRT. Indeed, we
have found that the FBI frustrated the prosecutors' efforts to
interview FBI headquarters witnesses, [G.J.], and withheld
documents relating to the shootings, including the shooting
incident report. This created an environment in which the USAO
was unlikely to even contemplate the HRT members being subjects
of a criminal investigation especially since the USAO believed
that the shooting incident had already been examined in an
administrative review of the incident. 

 d. Decision to Seek the Death Penalty 

  Finally, regarding the decision to seek the death
penalty, Ellsworth and Howen were aware that case law in the
Ninth Circuit did not support the application of the death
penalty in circumstances such as those presented by the
Weaver/Harris case. [FN1246] The prosecution chose to proceed 
based on arguments raised by the Department of Justice in an 
appeal then pending before the Ninth Circuit. [FN1247] We do 
not fault the prosecution for adopting the Department's legal 
theory and seeking a ruling from the trial court based on that 
theory. 

  We do, however, share the misgivings expressed by some
members of the Department of Justice as to whether this was
factually an appropriate case for imposition of the death
penalty. [FN1248] Keeney and Margolis appear to have deferred to 
the Ellsworth and Howen's representations about the strength of 
the proof in the case. [FN1249] Ellsworth and Howen assured them 
and this investigation that they were serious and wanted to 
proceed with the request. [FN1250]

  There is no evidence to dispute the good faith of the prosecution 
in making the application to seek the death penalty. [FN1251]
We are not convinced, though, that the confidence expressed by
the U.S. Attorney's Office that this case presented a good set
of facts to test the viability of the death penalty in Idaho was
justified. 

  4. Conclusion 

  We share many of the reservations about the scope of the
conspiracy count expressed by members of the Marshals Service
and the FBI. Although we did not find that the prosecutors
charged Weaver and Harris in bad faith, we believe that their
judgments were not always as thoughtful and well reasoned as
they should have been. 

  [G.J.] 

  [FN1252]

  Finally, the decision to seek the death penalty may be
viewed as overarching by the prosecution.

verdict, which could have been based on various factors,

be allowed to consider all evidence that tends to mitigate moral
culpability and militate against a sentence of death.  See Zant

a trivial matter unlikely to prejudice the jury unduly.

abetted offensive action against the helicopter by hoding the
door open.  From Horuichi's testimony, it is clear that the
threat to the helicopter had ceased by the time Randy and Sara
Weaver and Harris ran to the cabin.  The overt act alleges that

IV. SPECIFIC ISSUES INVESTIGATED

  M. Alleged Problems with the FBI's Participation and
Cooperation in the Discovery Process 

  1. Introduction 

  From the beginning of its preparation of the Weaver case
for trial, it was always the intent of the U.S. Attorney's
Office in Boise, Idaho ("USAO") to provide discovery to the defense
in accordance with a modified open discovery policy. [FN1253]
This discovery policy together with the scope and breadth of the
indictment created concern among members of the FBI including
those at FBI headquarters. [FN1254] Such concern contributed to a
resistance by the FBI to produce certain materials that the USAO
deemed pertinent to the case but which the FBI believed were
either irrelevant to what it perceived to be the real issues in
the case or too sensitive to be disclosed. In addition, some
believed that the failure of the FBI laboratory to process
materials and to conduct tests in a timely fashion further
impaired the ability of the USAO to respond to the discovery
demands of the Weaver case. [FN1255] A final discovery problem 
surfaced during trial when the FBI produced, in response to a 
defense subpoena, additional documents related to the FBI shooting
incident report which the USAO maintained it had requested in
discovery throughout the pretrial period. It has been alleged
that these problems and the delays and embarrassment that
resulted were unnecessary and adversely affected the Weaver
case. 

  2. Statement of Facts 

  a. Defining the Scope of Discovery 

  Immediately after Harris and Weaver surrendered to law
enforcement authorities, the USAO began preparing the case for
indictment and trial. Important components of this process
included taking steps to insure that evidence was located and
preserved and developing a discovery strategy. [FN1256] Due to 
the intense media interest in the Weaver case coupled with the
defense allegations that law enforcement personnel had acted
unlawfully and that government officials were participating in a
coverup, members of the USAO decided to adopt a modified open
discovery policy. [FN1257] Such a discovery policy was consistent
with the USAO practice in handling other cases in their district. 

  On October 16, the USAO and defense counsel entered into
an agreement captioned "Stipulation and Reciprocal Request for
Discovery and Inspection, Notice of Alibi and Notice of Mental
Condition" which set forth the discovery obligations of the
parties. Pursuant to the terms of the stipulation, the parties
were to provide the reciprocal disclosure of the materials
stated in Rule 16(a)(1) and 16(b)(1) and the "reciprocal pre-
trial disclosure and inspection of Jencks Act (18 U.S.C. 3500)
materials, Rule 26.2, F.R. Crim. P materials and transcripts of
testimony and exhibits presented to the Grand Jury." [FN1258] It 
was further agreed that "rough notes [were] generally not Jencks or
Rule 26.2 materials unless they [were] a substantially verbatim
recital of the trial or intended trial witness' oral statement
or seen, signed or otherwise adopted by the witness' oral statement, 
or seen, signed, or otherwise adopted by the witness . . ." 
[FN1259] The stipulation added that "in the exchange of Jencks or
Rule 26.2 materials including rough notes, the parties [were]
authorized to redact information from those materials as
permitted by case law, statute or rule, including but not
limited to . . . information directly or indirectly relating to
equipment, tactics and strategies of investigation, apprehension
or arrest and case preparation. Such redaction [was to] be
subject to in camera inspection by the Court upon written motion
or objection of a party." [FN1260] With regard to the timing of
discovery the stipulation stated that, "[i]t is the intention of
the parties to accelerate the time table for discovery and
inspection to a time significantly in advance of trial so that
all pre-trial motions are fully and promptly made and ruled on,
so that trial preparation is completed in advance of trial, so
that unjustifiable delay and expense are eliminated which may
result from literal application of the statutes and rules, and
so that a fair, just and truthful determination of the charges
pending against the defendants may be resolved consistent with
the security concerns of the Court, the parties, defendants and
prospective witnesses. . . . The parties further stipulate[d]
and agree[d] to file a written response to [the] stipulation on
or before October 23, 1992, and on a continuing basis thereafter
pursuant to Rules 12.1(c), 12.2 (a) and (b) and 16 (c), F.R.
Crim. P." [FN1261]

  A week after signing of the stipulation, the government
provided its initial discovery response. [FN1262] The government
continued to provide material during the pretrial period and
into the trial. Indeed, the government filed multiple addenda
summarizing the huge volume of materials that had been produced
to the defense, including video tapes, audio tapes,
investigative reports, laboratory reports and thousands of pages
of documents. 

  Much of the material that the government produced in
discovery originated from the FBI and was produced on a timely
basis. However, questions have been raised as to whether
actions by the FBI impeded the discovery process. In
particular, allegations have been made that the FBI failed to
cooperate with allegations have been made that the FBI failed to
cooperate with the USAO in meeting its discovery obligations and
unjustifiably resisted producing certain documents. These
actions are alleged to have impacted adversely on the
prosecution of the Weaver case. 

  b. The FBI Response to Discovery Demands 

  From his very first communications with Special Agent in
Charge Eugena Glenn on September 3, 1992, [FN1263] U.S. Attorney
Ellsworth made it clear that it was important for the FBI to
preserve and produce a broad range of documents that would be
pertinent to discovery and trial. Ellsworth and Assistant U.S.
Attorney Ronald Howen, who was primarily responsible for the
discovery matters in the Weaver prosecution, strongly believed
that a complete production of relevant materials [FN1264] was 
critical to defend against the charge of a government coverup. 
Throughout the pretrial period members of the USAO repeatedly 
requested the FBI to produce all pertinent materials and 
requested an opportunity to review all the relevant files at FBI
headquarters. 

  According to Supervisory Special Agent T. Michael Dillon,
most of the conversations with the USAO concerning discovery
occurred between the FBI case agents -- Special Agents Joseph
Venkus and Gregory Rampton -- and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Howen
and Kim Lindquist. Rampton and Venkus passed these discovery
requests to Dillon, who relayed them to FBI Headquarters. 
Dillon told investigators that from the beginning of the Weaver
case he was required to make frequent phone calls to FBI
Headquarters in an attempt to assist in the release of discovery
materials. He stated that most of his contacts were with Gale
Evans of the Violent Crimes Unit of the Criminal Investigative
Division ("CID") although he did recall at least one phone
conversation with Section Chief Michael Kahoe. [FN1266]

  It is normal FBI practice for the Principal Legal Advisor
at the Field Division level to handle discovery requests since
they usually have access to the requested materials. [FN1267] 
In this case, however, the Boise Resident Agency produced those
materials over which they had access and then coordinated with
FBI headquarters regarding the other materials that were housed
or controlled there. [FN1268]

  [GARRITY] 

  [FN1269]

  [FN1270]

  The first discovery conflict surfaced on September 23,
1992, when Lindquist travelled with Rampton to Quantico,
Virginia to meet with Assistant Special Agent in Charge Richard
Rogers to discuss the actions of the Hostage Rescue Team
("HRT"). While at Quantico they met with special agent Lester
Hazen who showed them a copy of the operations plan drafted for
the HRT during the Ruby Ridge crisis. When Lindquist requested
a copy of the operations plan Rogers responded that the
operations plan had never been approved and he did not want to
produce the document to Lindquist because it contained sensitive
information. Finding this position unacceptable, Lindquist is
reported to have told Rogers that he would obtain a court order
that would permit him to have access to the operations plan. 
Because it appeared that neither Rogers nor Lindquist were
willing to compromise, Rampton suggested that Lindquist be able
to review the report but not be given a copy of it. If the
court requested the information later, Rampton proposed that the
parties could negotiate further about the release of the
information. Rampton reported that Lindquist and Rogers acceded
to this compromise. [FN1271]

  Rogers also informed Lindquist and Rampton that all of
the HRT members had prepared signed sworn statements as part of
an internal shooting review conducted by the Inspection Division
of the FBI. When Rampton requested these statements, Rogers
told him that he did not have the authority to release them and
instructed Rampton to contact the Inspection Division. Later
Rampton spoke with Paul Philip, the Deputy Assistant Director of
the Inspection Division about obtaining these statements. [FN1272]
Rampton recalled that Philip contacted Dave Binney who told him
that the signed statements could be given to Lindquist. Thereafter,
Rampton informed Rogers of the authorization, obtained the sworn 
statements from the HRT members, attached a cover 302 and produced 
them to Lindquist. [FN1273] Lindquist recalls that he reviewed 
these statements on this trip but that he never was given access 
to the entire shooting incident report. [FN1274]

 c. Attempts to Resolve the Discovery Disputes 

  Unable to resolve its disagreement with the FBI regarding
these documents, both the USAO and the FBI sought the assistance
of the Terrorism and Violent Crime Section ("TVCS") of the
Criminal Division of the Department of Justice in Washington,
D.C. The initial disagreement between the USAO and the FBI
focused on a relatively small number of documents. The most
significant documents in this group were the September 30, 1992
shooting incident report; the November 9, 1992 shooting incident
Review Group memorandum; the FBI operations plan and annex; and,
later, the FBI critique of the U.S. Marshals Service. 

  [FN1281]

  [GARRITY] 

  [FN1282]

  [GARRITY] 

 (1) Documents at Issue 

  The first document at issue was the shooting incident
report dated September 30, 1992. That document was a report
prepared by a shooting incident review team of the Inspection
Division of the FBI and represented the findings of an
administrative inquiry into the August 22, 1992 shootings by the 
HRT at Ruby Ridge which resulted in the death of Vicki Weaver and
the injuries to Kevin Harris and Randy Weaver. [FN1283] It 
consisted of: a 5-page cover memo with findings from Inspector 
Thomas W. Miller dated September 30, 1992; the statements of the HRT
members some of which were signed sworn statements and others
which were in the form of a FD-302; [FN1284] autopsy reports of 
the three individuals killed at Ruby Ridge; a statement of the 
prospective status of the subjects; crime scene photographs and 
diagrams; and news clippings. The notes of the investigators who
conducted the interviews of the HRT members were not included as
part of the report. 

  The shooting incident report had been forwarded to the
Shooting Incident Review Group ("Review Group") which reviewed
it to determine if any administrative action was warranted
against any FBI employee involved in the shootings. After
analyzing the report, the Review Group prepared a four-page
memorandum articulating its views as to whether administrative
action was appropriate. In this memorandum dated November 9,
1992, the Review Group concluded that the actions taken were
lawful and within FBI rules and procedures and thus no
administrative action was necessary. This memorandum was
attached to the September 30, 1992 report and forwarded to
Steven Pomerantz, the Assistant Director of the Administrative
Services Division. 

  [GARRITY] 

  Although the FBI had produced in discovery most of the FD-302
statements of those interviewed in the internal investigation,
it was unwilling to produce the entire shooting incident report
because it was an internal document that had never previously
been produced in discovery. 

  [GARRITY] 

  [FN1285]

  [GARRITY] 

  [FN1286]

  Another document at issue was the operational plan and annex
which set forth the initial strategy contemplated for the
operational plan to be used at Ruby Ridge. [FN1287] Components of 
this plan included controlling the crisis site through the deployment
of sniper/observers followed by establishing communications with
Weaver and others in the cabin. 

  [GARRITY] 

  [FN1288]

  [GARRITY] 

  [FN1289]

  The third document that the FBI did not want to produce in
discovery has been referred to as the "marshals critique." [FN1290] 
This is a two page document containing 12 critical observations of
the actions of the Marshals Service at Ruby Ridge. These
observations are supposed to be based on interviews of members
of the Marshals Service and the HRT. Special Agent Venkus and
Assistant U.S. Attorney Lindquist first learned of this document
on December 1, 1992 when they traveled to Washington, D.C. to
review the FBI headquarters file and to talk with HRT members.
Venkus made a copy of the critique and took it back to the FBI
office in Boise where Venkus gave Lindquist access to it under
the condition that it be returned. [FN1291]

  Because of the critical nature of the critique, the Bureau
resisted its disclosure. 

inappropriate because it [GARRITY] [FN1292] Dillon reportedly told
Deputy Marshal Masaitis that he would rather see a mistrial than
produce the marshals critique in discovery. [FN1293] When Lindquist 
tried to explain to Dillon the serious repercussions that would 
occur if the government failed to produce the critique in discovery
but later produced it in response to a Freedom of Information
Act request, Dillon responded that the document had come from
someone's desk and was not in any official file that would be
searched for a FOIA. request. From Dillon's comments, Lindquist
was concerned that someone from the Bureau might be
contemplating destroying the document so that it would not have
to be produced. Lindquist advised strenuously against such
action. [FN1294]

  (2) Negotiations Among the Parties 

  Due to the complaints received from the USAO and the FBI,
attorneys from the Terrorism and Violent Crime Section of the
Department of Justice contacted FBI officials in an attempt to
solve the impasse. [FN1295]

  [GARRITY] 

  [FN1296]

  With the arrival of 1993, the USAO and FBI could still not
agree on what documents needed to be produced in discovery. On
January 4, Howen and Lindquist met with the FBI case agents and
repeated their request for all pertinent documents at FBI 
Headquarters, including the shooting incident report. [FN1297] 
On January 6, Howen sent a letter to Glenn in which he formally 
repeated his earlier requests for all pertinent materials from FBI
headquarters and elsewhere, including files, reports, documents,
that they had not previously received. Howen then wrote, "[i]n
other words, we want access to everything." Howen also requested
a copy of "[t]he administrative file concerning the review of
the HRT sniper shooting on August 22, 1992 . . . but not limited
to, the shooting reports, the names and phone numbers of the
agents who participated in the preparation of the report, any
diagrams or charts of angles, including a preliminary diagram
that showed the sniper shot directly into the house, and any
other document or papers" and "[a]ny other documents or reports
of any evaluations or critiques of the actions of . . . the HRT
team on August 22-31, 1992." [FN1298] Copies of this letter were 
sent to James Reynolds and Michael Dillon. 

  Later that same day, U.S. Attorney Ellsworth called James
Reynolds, Chief of the Terrorism and Violent Crime Section of
the Criminal Division of DOJ, and complained that the local FBI
was refusing to produce documents needed in the Weaver case.
Although a number of documents were involved involved, Ellsworth
identified the most critical ones as being the shooting incident
report and the HRT operations plan. Following his conversation
with Ellsworth, Reynolds arranged a meeting for the next day at
the Department of Justice with FBI officials to discuss the
discovery dispute. [FN1299]

  The first meeting was held on January 7. Attending the meeting
on behalf of the Department were Deputy Assistant Attorney
General Mark Richard who chaired the meeting, Reynolds, and
Deputy Section Chiefs Dana Biehl and Mary Incontro; attending
the meeting on behalf of the FBI were Danny Coulson and Mike
Kahoe, the Chairman of the Shooting Incident Review Group. At
the meeting the participants focused on the scope of the
indictment and the specific documents that the FBI did not want
to produce. The FBI maintained that the indictment was too broad
and should have been limited to the death of Deputy Marshal
Degan on August 21. The FBI argued that a more narrowly drafted
indictment would have eliminated the need to produce the
documents at issue. [FN1300] Richard, who opined that it was much
too late to shift the government's theory of the case, agreed with
Reynolds that a more narrow indictment would not have shielded
the documents from production. [FN1301]

  With regard to the documents at issue, Coulson articulated his
concern that the operations plan had never been approved and
that if the operations plan were to be released it would
disclose HRT operational secrets. As a compromise, Coulson
offered to allow the prosecutors to view the operations plan
after the sensitive information had been redacted. Reynolds
believed that this compromise was reasonable and stated that
when the USAO was informed of the proposal they agreed with it. 
[FN1302] At the end of the meeting, the FBI agreed to allow the 
USAO to view but not possess or produce the following documents: 
the November 9, 1992 Review Group memorandum; the August 23, 1992
operations plan and annex; the September 15, 1992 internal FBI
headquarters note; an undated internal FBI headquarters note
regarding the Weaver and Harris matter [FN1304]; 19 situation 
reports from August 23-31 1992; and the shooting incident report 
dated September 30, 1992. [FN1305]

  Later that day, Kahoe instructed Gale Evans, Unit Chief of the
Violent Crimes Unit of the Criminal Investigative Division, to
send the shooting incident report to Mike Dillon by overnight
delivery. Evans, who obtained a copy of the report from the
files of Kahoe who had been the Chairman of the Shooting
Incident Review Group, did not recall seeing interview notes
with the report. Thereafter, Evans prepared a memorandum to
accompany the report which incorporated instructions from Potts
that the report was to remain within FBI space and was to be
reviewed by prosecutors only within this space. [FN1306]

  On January 12, Evans forwarded the documents to Dillon that
the FBI had agreed to produce in the January 7th meeting [FN1307] 
and stated in the accompying memorandum: 

  As with the Shooting Report furnished to Salt Lake Division
over the weekend of 1/8/93, the above documents are to be
maintained in the Boise Resident Agency and afforded appropriate
security. Per Assistant Director Potts, these documents are not
to be released to the prosecution and are only to be reviewed
under FBI supervision. 

  [GARRITY] 

[FN1309] Venkus stated that when they received these instructions,
he, Rampton and Dillon were upset that they could not turn the
report over to the USAO. [FN1310]

  Lindquist reviewed these documents in the FBI office in Boise
on January 20. [FN1311] Following this review, Lindquist informed 
Howen that the report was not harmful to their case and that he
believed it was discoverable. [FN1312] Shortly thereafter, 
Ellsworth wrote a letter to Dillon requesting that he provide the
following documents to review, to produce in discovery and to
use at trial: administrative shooting report, headquarters memo
of shooting report, operations plan and annex, internal
headquarters note with entries regarding the case and headquarters
situation reports such as SIOC log synopses. [FN1313] Ellsworth 
opined that the documents were either responsive to
the government's obligations under Jencks and Brady or were
otherwise discoverable. He then wrote: 

  Your agency requested that our office not have possession of
these documents or review them in discovery without first giving
you written notice and an opportunity to intervene or persuade
the Department of Justice to intervene in our decision regarding
discovery and inspection. We remain sensitive to your concerns
and wish to work with the F.B.I. in this regard, but, as we
addressed in our letter of January 6, 1993, our office needs
access to all files and documents at F.B.I. Headquarters that
related to this case, not only for use at trial, but, also, to
complete pretrial interviews of all potential witnesses. We
reiterate the need to review all such materials as they might be
further identified. [FN1314]

  Ellsworth closed the letter by requesting "immediate and
permanent possession of these materials and a review of any
additional possession of these materials and a review of any
additional that might still be identified." [FN1315] In early 
February 1993, Lindquist again requested the FBI to produce all
documentation at FBI Headquarters that was pertinent to the
Weaver case including the SIOC logs which Rampton subsequently
determined had already been produced. [FN1316]

  It was not until the middle of March 1993 that Department of
Justice officials learned that the FBI had still not produced
these documents to the USAO. Thereafter, Reynolds retrieved a
copy of the January 12, FBI memo transmitting the documents at
issue to the Boise Resident Agency. Using that document as a
reference Reynolds contacted the USAO and reviewed whether the
documents listed in that memorandum, including the FBI critique
of the marshals which Reynolds added to the list, were needed at
trial or for discovery. [FN1317] After his discussion with the 
USAO, Reynolds requested Dana Biehl to examine the documents that 
the USAO wanted to produce in discovery and to provide his views as
to whether they were discoverable. [FN1318] On March 17, Biehl sent
a memorandum to Reynolds in which he opined that the three
documents at issue were either Brady or Jencks material. [FN1319]

  After reviewing the Biehl memorandum, James Reynolds, on March
18, sent a memorandum to Mark Richard informing him of the
continuing discovery dispute between the FBI and the USAO. In
addition to the documents discussed at the January 7th meeting,
Reynolds told Richard that an additional document -- a marshal's
critique which the prosecution knew existed but had never seen-
- had been added to the list of documents that the FBI did not
want to produce. Reynolds informed Richard that all of the
documents at issue, with the exception of some internal FBI
headquarters notes, appeared to be discoverable or to constitute
Jencks or Brady material. He recommended that they work with the
FBI and the prosecutors to resolve the issues and to develop a
strategy to protect sensitive information within some of the
documents. In addition, Reynolds noted, "we need to ensure that
there is no additional material at Headquarters that is
discoverable. While personnel of this Section are prepared to
staff this effort, we have not been successful in initiating it,
as the Bureau's intransigence appears to emanate from Larry
Potts' level or above." [FN1320]

  Five days later, a second meeting was held at the Department
of Justice to discuss the discovery dispute. This March 23rd
meeting was attended by Richard, Reynolds, Incontro, and Biehl
from the Department of Justice and Potts, Coulson, Kahoe from
the FBI. According to Reynolds, the FBI continued to complain
about the scope of the indictment and its impact on their
discovery obligations. [FN1321] Incontro and Biehl recalled that 
they supported the USAO position that most of these documents,
including the shooting incident report, should be produced in
discovery. [FN1322] Reynolds recalled that Coulson finally 
consented to the production of the documents if sensitive portions
of the operations plan were redacted. Those individuals at the 
meeting thought that the proposal to redact the operations plan 
was reasonable. [FN1323]

  On March 26, the USAO filed its Eighth Addendum to its
Response to the Discovery Stipulation. In that document, the
government identified additional items that were being produced
in discovery including the November 9, 1992 Review Group Memo,
the situation reports, the shooting incident report, the 
operations plan and annex and the marshals critique. [FN1324]
Although identified in this filing, these documents were not 
produced to the defense until later. [FN1325] The shooting ]
incident report was delivered by hand on April 7, 1993; [FN1326] 
the situation reports and the operations plan were delivered on 
April 10, 1993; and the Review Group memo and the marshals 
critique were delivered on April 12, 1993. [FN1327] The Weaver 
trial began the next day on April 13, 1993. 

  d. The Defense Subpoena Deuces Tecum For the Shooting Incident
Report. 

  On April 13, 1993 the defense filed an ex parte application
for subpoenas duces tecum. Among the subpoenas sought was one
ordering Inspector Thomas W. Miller, who had headed the review
team examining the FBI shooting at Ruby Ridge, to bring "any and
all records used by the 'Shooting Incident Review Team.'" [FN1328]
Other subpoenas requested the FBI to produce copies of certain 
manual provisions and certain personnel files. [FN1329] Judge Lodge
approved the issuance of these subpoenas on April 14. It appears 
that defense counsel delivered the subpoena for Miller to the Boise 
office of the FBI. Dillon sent the subpoena to Miller and 
forwarded a copy to FBI Headquarters. Dillon recalled discussing 
this subpoena with Kahoe and telling him that the defense would 
want the notes developed during the shooting investigation. 
Thereafter, Dillon learned that the notes were in the Legal 
Counsel Division and he told Kahoe that they would have to be 
mailed to Miller for him to testify. [FN1330]

  The evidence is conflicting as to whether the FBI notified the
USAO of this subpoena. Rampton believed that during the trial
Lindquist asked Venus to obtain a copy of the subpoenaed
materials but that Venkus did not think that the information was
needed until Miller was scheduled to testify. [FN1331] A July 29,
1993 chronology of events prepared by Rampton and Venkus after the
trial and an April 28, 1993 handwritten note by Venkus indicate
that Lindquist was advised that once Venkus received the "1-A"
material sought by the subpoena he would produce it to Lindquist
who would give the material to the defense. [FN1332] Lindquist who
would give the material to the defense. Lindquist had a vague
recollection of perhaps hearing that a subpoena had been served
on Miller but he could recall no further details. [FN1333] Howen 
had no recollection of discussing with Lindquist in late April 
1993 any efforts that the FBI was taking to check the "1-A" files 
for the interview notes. [FN1334] Although Howen was aware of 
subpoenas issued at the same time for FBI manuals and personnel 
files, he did not recall learning about this subpoena until early 
June. [FN1335] However, he added that if he had known about the 
subpoena he would not have been concerned because he would have 
assumed that the FBI would have produced the same documents as 
they had produced in discovery. [FN1336]

  On April 14 or 15, Supervisory Special Agent Brian Callihan
from the Civil Litigation Unit I ("CLU I") of the LCD received a
phone call or a facsimile from the FBI office in Boise informing
him of two subpoenas that had been sent by Weaver's counsel.
According to Callihan, someone had decided that the subpoena
requesting the manual would be handled by the local office of
the FBI as a routine request for the FBI manual while the
subpoena directed to Miller would be handled by the LCD even
though it had not been properly served. 

  Attached to the subpoenas was a letter dated April 12, 1993
from defense counsel Charles Peterson to "potential witness"
advising the witness as follows" 

  Although the subpoena requires your attendance on April 17,
1993, I expect that you will not be called to testify until the
completion of the Government's case, some six weeks into the
trial. Please call my office as soon as possible so that you may
be advised of a specific date and time to appear -- otherwise
the subpoena requires you to attend continuously from the
beginning of the trial until your testimony is given. If I am
unavailable, please ask for Diane or Yvonne. [FN1337]

  Calihan stated that the letter left him with the belief that
defense counsel would advise Miller when to appear. [FN1338] 
Because Callihan believed that Miller would probably not testify 
for at least another two months, he saw no reason to expedite the
production of the subpoenaed documents. Callihan insisted that
no one ever informed him that there was a need to expedite the
handling of the subpoena or that the records were needed prior
to the testimony of Miller. In addition, he believed that proper
service of the subpoena had never been made on Miller. [FN1339]
Accordingly, he processed the subpoena consistent with routine
procedures by sending it to the Civil Discovery Unit ("CDRU") of
the LCD. 

  On April 30, two weeks after first learning of the subpoena,
Callihan prepared a request to the CDRU and described the
litigation as follows: 

  Criminal trial is ongoing. The U.S. Attorney's office has
previously released a number of documents to the defense. The
attached subpoena requests additional documents for release to
the defense. [FN1340]

  He then described the work that needed to be done: 

  Locate and process for release to the defense attorney
documents responsive to the attached subpoena. The shooting
report has previously been released. The records used by the
Shooting Incident Review Team would include 1-A's in the
Shooting Review file and any other documents referred to and
relied upon in the Shooting Report. [FN1341]

  Callihan also requested that the search be coordinated with CLU
I and with Division 6. [FN1342]

  The Callihan request was directed to Monique Wilson. When
Wilson first reviewed the subpoena she did not think that it
included a request for the handwritten notes so she discussed
the issue with Callihan on April 30. Callihan instructed her
that the notes should be included. Later that day she requested
the file from the confidential file room and received it shortly
thereafter. However, when she examined the materials that had
been produced she noticed that the handwritten notes were
missing. She then returned to the confidential file room where
they found the handwritten notes in the bulky exhibit section.
Wilson stated that there was initial confusion in locating these
notes because an incorrect date had been placed on the outside
of the bulky package. Thereafter, Wilson processed the
documents, made 5 copies as requested by Callihan and forwarded
these materials to Callihan on May 11. [FN1343]

  When Callihan received the package from CDRU he reviewed it,
approved it for dissemination and sent it on May 21, 1993 to the
FBI mail room with a cover letter instructing them to send it to
Miller and to send courtesy copies to the USAO. [FN1344] Callihan
did not include instructions as to how the package was to be 
mailed; he concluded later that considering the size of the 
package and the absence of specific mailing instructions that it 
would have been sent by fourth class mail. [FN1345]

  Two weeks later, on June 4, the package arrived at the USAO.
Roberta Cruser, the docket technician for the USAO, opened the
package, dated stamped the Callihan cover letter and routed the
materials at about 10:00 a.m. that morning to Howen. [FNB1346] At 
the luncheon recess Howen returned to his office. The court had 
just excused HRT member Lon Horiuchi after defense questioning hag
been completed. When Howen arrived in his office he discovered
the package on his desk with the May 21 cover letter from
Callihan which indicated that Callihan was enclosing two copies
of documents responsive to the defense subpoena seeking "any and
all records used by the Shooting Incident Review Team." In
addition, the letter stated: 

  These documents consist of the original statements, and the FBI
Manual of Investigative Operations and Guidelines provisions
noted in the report as being read by all members of the Shooting
Incident Review Unit and we believe that they are ready for
release to the defendants' attorneys. [FN1347]

  Howen recognized that many of the documents in the package had
been provided previously to them and to the defense in
discovery. However, other documents in the package had never
been produced. These never produced documents were: the agents'
interview notes from the "1-A" files of all FBI personnel
interviewed in the investigation except for Eugene Glen; and two
drawings by HRT sniper Horiuchi including a shooting diagram of
the second shot taken through the Weaver front door on August
22, 1992. When Howen examined the materials in the package and
saw the Horiuchi diagram he knew that the late production of
these materials would be difficult for the prosecution to
explain and would result in significant criticism by the media.
The impact was even greater because it followed closely behind
several other damaging and embarrassing disclosures made during
the trial. [FN1348] Howen stated that he does not think that he 
had ever "been as low professionally." [FN1349]

  Thereafter, Howen returned to the courtroom and informed the
parties of the package that he had just received. Defense
counsel referred to it as the latest in a series of incidents
that had prejudiced the rights of the defendant and moved for
the case to be dismissed because of alleged prosecutorial
misconduct and for sanctions to be imposed on the government.
Howen, after noting that many of the materials in the package
had been previously produced, [FN1350] informed the court that 
his office was in the process of trying to determine the reasons
for the late production of these materials. Howen stressed that 
his office produced the materials as soon as they were received 
and suggested that the responsibility for the late production of
these materials rested elsewhere. The court deferred a
definitive ruling until after the weekend and then stated, 

  [T]he Court is very upset about these things happening. It does
appear that it is somewhat of a pattern on the part of people,
agencies outside of the District of Idaho. The Court does not
agree that there is any evidence that the U.S. Attorney's Office
at least locally, is doing anything to hinder the prosecution of
this case or prejudice the defense. The comments of Mr. Howen
just now indicate his veracity and his sincerity in trying to
comply with the rules . . . . It seems to be totally inexcusable
and extremely poor judgment on the part of whoever is involved
to send something like this fourth class mail when a trial of
this nature is going to, the cost of time and human tragedy that
is involved. [FN1351]

  Following the court session, the USAO and others sought an
explanation for the late arrival of the package of materials
sent by Callihan. Callihan recalls that on June 4, a woman from
the USAO called and asked in a "rude and obnoxious" manner why
the documents had been sent by fourth class mail and why it had
taken so long to send them. Callihan stated that he inquired why
there was such a concern to which the woman said that Howen was
upset about the delay. Callihan then told her that the request
had been handled like similar requests and that Howen could call
him to discuss the matter if he wanted. [FN1352]

  Sometime between 5:30 and 6:00 p.m. on June 4, Dillon
telephoned Joseph R. Davis, Assistant Director of the Legal
Counsel Division and informed him that the FBI headquarters was
responsible for the late production of the documents in the
Weaver case and that the judge in the case was very upset. [FN1353]
Dillon also mentioned that he had received an earlier discovery
request for these documents but had not received the documents
until that day. He told Davis that the U.S. Attorney had
requested the FBI to provide an explanation for the delay to
give to the judge. Davis left messages on the answering machines
of Brian Callihan and Thomas Clawson to call him. [FN1354]

  Later that same day, Callihan returned Davis' call. Davis
informed him that the U.S. Attorney and Dillon were upset about
the lateness of the transmittal and were unsure of what
documents were in controversy. Callihan explained how he
processed the request and repeated his understanding that there
was no urgency to the request since Miller had not been expected
to testify for several months. [FN1355]

  Thereafter, Davis called Ellsworth to attempt to resolve the
conflict between the accounts given by Dillon and Callihan.
During a conference call in which Davis, Callihan, Ellsworth,
Dillon and perhaps others participated, Callihan repeated his
version of events. Howen remarked that these documents were
responsive to a number of discovery requests and should have
been produced earlier. Ellsworth agreed and, along with Howen,
requested LCD and Dillon to prepare sworn declarations to the
court explaining the production delay. These declarations were
prepared and sent to the USAO. [FN1356]

  Sometime around June 5, the government received an affidavit
prepared by Brian Callihan in which he detailed how he learned
of the subpoena, the actions he took in responding to it and the
beliefs he had concerning the time requirements for production
of the materials. Callihan then stated, "[a]lthough I may have
been aware of a request from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the
Shooting Incident Review Group Report, I was unaware that the
U.S. Attorney's Office had previously requested any or all other
records, documents, and notes in connection with this
investigation." [FN1357] Dillon also prepared a draft affidavit 
in which he accepted responsibility for not adequately relaying 
the USAO request to FBI headquarters. Howen decided not to file 
any of the affidavits filed by individuals involved in the 
incident. [FN1358]

  On June 8, the parties made additional arguments to the court
concerning how they should proceed after the disclosure of the
subpoenaed materials. Of particular focus of the parties was the
Horiuchi drawing and its significance. The court reserved its
ruling until the next day but before doing so stated that: 

  The Court does not excuse the FBI Agency,
The Court thinks there has been a failure to comply
with what was fully understand [sic] to be required.
They get involved in these technicalities as to who
was served, but it is obvious they had notice of it,
they were aware of what was required, and again, it
is not anytime to be playing games with the Court
on technicalities. [FN1359]

   Judge Lodge issues his ruling on June 9 and ordered 
Horiuchito return for further examination in court due to the 
failure of the government to produce the materials in a timely 
manner.  In addition, he assessed against the government the 
costs and defense attorney fees for the one-day delay. [FN1360]  
Almost five months later, on October 26, Judge Lodge issues an 
order imposing a separate fine of $1920 against the FBI.  This 
fine represented the fees paid to defense counsel on the day 
that Horiuchi was brought back to testify.  In this order, which 
is discussed more fully in section IV(o), Judge Lodge was highly 
critical of the actions of the FBI which he believed hampered 
the ability of the government to comply with its obligations to 
produce discoverable documents including Jencks and Brady 
materials.  As a result of these actions, Judge Lodge found that 
the FBI had failed to comply with its discovery obligations under 
Fed. R. Crim. P. 16 and held them to be in contempt of court in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 401. [FN1361]

3.   Discussion

               a.   FBI Resistance to USAO Discovery Requests

  Our investigation has revealed that the prosecution of the
Weaver matter was plagued and complicated by a continuing series
of disagreements, misunderstandings and preconceptions that existed
between the FBI and the USAO.  One of the areas where such
problems surfaced involved the efforts of the USAO t respond to its
discovery obligations in the case.  Over the course of the
pretrial period, the FBI produced a large volume of material on a timely
basis.  Indeed, the FBI Resident Agency in Boise appeared to have
been cooperative with the USAO and to have made good faith
efforts to comply with the requests of the USAO.

     Although the overall effort of the FBI to respond to the
discovery requests of the USAO appeared to have been good, we
have found two areas where problems existed.  The first involves 
the problems associated with the actions of the FBI Laboratory, 
which are discussed elsewhere in this report.  The second area
concerned the resistance of personnel at FBI headquarters to 
produce a group of documents that was small in number but 
significant in importance to the issues in the case. [FN1362]

     With regard to the production of this group of documents, 
it is our conclusion that FBI personnel, predominantly at the
headquarters level, [FN1363] imposed unreasonable resistance and
applied inappropriate standards to the discovery requests from 
the USAO, exhibited an unjustified unwillingness to cooperate as 
a teen member in the prosecution, and evidenced a troubling 
distrust of the USAO.  Indeed, we were distressed by the 
persistent intransigence shown by FBI headquarters personnel.

     From the outset, officials at FBI headquarters opposed the
prosecutors' theory of the case.  They steadfastly adhered to
their view that the indictment should be limited to the assault 
of a federal officer charge and that the conspiracy count was not
supported by the evidence.  The prosecutors were aware of this
view but disagreed with it. Although a free exchange of ideas and
information should always occur between the FBI and the USAO, the
FBI in this case failed to appreciate that it is the prosecutor
not the FBI that controls the direction of the prosecution.  The 
FBI failed to identify the point where healthy debate became
destructive resistance.

     The FBI used their disagreement over the scope of the
indictment to support their refusal to produce certain materials
in discovery.  In the final analysis, with one exception, there
seems to have been little basis for their refusal to produce 
these materials.  Although the shooting incident report was an
internal document, it was certainly pertinent to the issues in
the prosecution.  Even members of the FBI conceded its relevance.
[FN1364] Standing alone, the fact that such a report had never been
produced in discovery was not a basis to resist its production. 
Furthermore, as a practical matter, most of its contents,
including the statements of the HRT members, had already been 
produced in discovery.  Nor do we think that the resistance of 
the FBI to producing the November 9, 1992 Review Group memorandum 
was justified.  Again, a document that was shielded from criminal
discovery simply because it is evaluative in nature.  Similarly,
with respect to the marshals critique, there seemed no sound
basis upon which the FBI could object to its production. The 
marshals critique may have been embarrassing to the FBI and the 
Marshals Service and it may not have been the result of thorough 
research and analysis but those factors are totally irrelevant to 
its discoverability.  Of all the contested documents, the only one
for which the FBI would seem to have had a valid concern was the
operations plan and annex.  However, as was ultimately done, the
sensitive portions were redacted from the document before being
produced to the defense.  The prosecutors did not object to the
redactions and, indeed, from the beginning of the controversy had
been willing to consider the redaction of the document. [FN1365] 
Despite this willingness to compromise, the FBI maintained a
course of stubborn resistance.

     In addition to the unjustified refusal to produce these
materials we are concerned by the bureaucratic resistance of the
FBI.  Although objections were raised to producing these
documents in discovery, no one ever assumed control at the 
headquarters level in an attempt to resolve the dispute 
expeditiously.  Instead the controversy lingered for months
before all of the documents were eventually produced in
discovery. During this process, the FBI seemed to lose sight of 
its role as the investigative arm of the Department of Justice 
which is supposed to assist, not impede, federal prosecutors in 
pursuing violators of federal criminal laws.  It was not until the
Criminal Division of the Department of Justice intervened that the
discovery dispute was received. [FN1366]

     Our investigation revealed that the discovery problems were
symptomatic of a disturbing distrust by the FBI of the local
federal prosecutors.  Nothing in our investigation provided any
explanation or justification for this lack of trust.  We hope
that the uncooperative attitude displayed by the FBI in the Weaver
matter was an aberration.  James Reynolds characterized the
discovery dispute in the Weaver case as "unique."  He told
investigators that it was unusual for the Department to become
involved in pretrial discovery disputes in cases litigated by the
U.S. Attorneys.  The refusal and reluctance of the FBI to permit
the prosecutors to view the documents was, in Reynolds' view,
inconsistent with his prior experience with other agencies in
releasing material that was classified or of even greater
sensitivity than the documents at issue in the Weaver case. 
Reynolds stated that it was apparent to him that the Violent
Crimes Section of the FBI did not have a good idea of what was 
legally discoverable in a criminal case. [FN1367]

  FBI officials blamed some of the discovery difficulties to the
attitudes of members of the USAO.

                            [GARRITY]

                                        [FN1368] Our investigation
found no support for these claims.  From the beginning of the
preparation of the case for trial, the USAO made it clear as to
the scope of discovery and the types of materials that needed to 
be produced.  Despite its repeated requests to review the
headquarters files related to this case, the prosecutors were
never afforded this opportunity. [FN1369]  Indeed, to this day, the
prosecutors are not confident that all pertinent materials located
from FBI Headquarters were shown to them. [FN1370]  The prosecutors
recognized the discoverability of the contested documents and
believed that they were obligated to produce them.  The
determination to obtain and produce discoverable materials cannot
be classified as intransigent behavior.

     Although we believe that the USAO was clear in articulating
the materials that needed to be produced in discovery, we are
somewhat perplexed as to their failure to keep the Department of
Justice officials who were assisting them in resolving the dispute
better informed of the progress of the FBI in producing the
documents at issue.  After the January 7 meeting, over two months
passed before the USAO contacted the Department of Justice to
inform them that the FBI still needed to produce these documents so
that the USAO had gained possession of these documents.  The USAO
never informed the Department of Justice officials of this
additional delay and thus, never gained the further benefit of any
assistance that they could have provided.  Perhaps if the USAO had
been more aggressive in keeping the Department informed of the
progress of the production of the documents the controversy could
have been resolved sooner.

     It is unclear what exact impact the dispute over these
documents had on the government's case.  Neither Howen nor
Lindquist viewed this controversy as determinative of the outcome
of the case. [FN1371]  However, Lindquist thought that the repeated
controversies over discovery issues had a cumulative effect on the
judge that resulted in the judge imposing sanctions on the
government after the untimely delivery of the subpoenaed version
of the shooting incident report. [FN1372]  In addition, the dispute
needlessly diverted the valuable time, energy and attention of the
prosecutors from critical trial preparation tasks.  Ellsworth
stated that they felt that they were "battling on two front" -- the
defense counsel and the FBI. [FN1373]  The prosecutors did not need 
the added aggravation of engaging in this debate at a time when they
were required to prepare the case and witnesses for trial and to
respond to continuous defense motions.  The discovery debate also
worsened the already tense relationship between the USAO and the
FBI Resident Agency in Boise. [FN1374]  Indeed, Dillon thought that 
the reluctance of the FBI Headquarters to release the documents
contributed further to the tension between his office and the
USAO.1375  The USAO had the right to expect the cooperation of the
FBI throughout all phases of the discovery process.  However,
instead of a partner in this process, FBI Headquarters assumed the
role of an adversary.

    b.   Problems With Producing the Complete Shooting Incident 
Report and Supporting Materials

     Our investigation confirms that the USAO from September 1992
and throughout the pretrial period repeatedly requested the FBI to
provide all materials pertinent to the events that occurred at Ruby
Ridge. [FN1376]  As the case preparation proceeded, the USAO renewed
their requests for this material on a number of occasions. 
Moreover, as they learned that particular documents existed they
included these documents in their requests.  One such document was
the shooting incident report dated September 30, 1992 and the
memorandum of the Shooting Incident Review Group dated November 9,
1992.  When the USAO finally received these documents on the eve of
trial they believed that the materials produced to them constituted
all of the documents related to the shooting report.  However, 
unknown to them at the time, the production was incomplete.

     Shortly after the trial began and apparently without the
knowledge of the USAO, the FBI received a defense subpoena for the
shooting incident report and supporting materials.  Five weeks
later, the Legal Counsel Division of the FBI completed its response
to the subpoena and sent the large package, without mailing
instructions, to its mail room for shipment.  Two weeks later, the
package arrived at the USAO in Boise.  Howen discovered upon
opening the package that it contained, in addition to the shooting
incident report that the government had already produced to the
defense, the interview notes of the HRT members and two drawings by
FBI sniper Lon Horiuchi.  None of these latter materials had ever
been shown or given to the USAO.

     The late production of these materials was significant and had
a detrimental impact on the prosecution of the Weaver case. 
Indeed, this event provided additional support for the defense
argument that the government was covering up the events that had
occurred at Ruby Ridge.  Moreover, the U.S. Attorney opined that
when Horiuchi was called back for further cross examination, it
afforded the defense another opportunity to remind the jury of the
death of Vicki Weaver and how she had been killed. [FN1377]

     The untimely production of these materials raises a number of
concerns.  First and foremost is why these materials were not
produced during the pretrial discovery phase of the case.  there
can be no doubt that the USAO requested these materials in a timely
fashion and that they were entitled to have the FBI produce them
promptly.  Throughout the pretrial period the USAO, most notably
Howen, repeatedly requested the FBI to produce all materials
related to the FBI's participation at the crisis at Ruby Ridge.  It
appears that Dillon transmitted many of the USAO discovery requests
to FBI Headquarters.  Moreover, in addition to any communications
received from the Boise Resident Agency, FBI Headquarters personnel
were notified of these requests from direct communications with the
USAO as well as by their discussions with members of the Terrorism
and Violent Crime Section of the Department of Justice.  Indeed,
FBI headquarters officials were disgruntled because of the
persistent attempts of the USAO to obtain 'everything."  However,
if there was ever any question as to the scope of materials that
the USAO wanted with respect to the shooting incident report it
surely was resolved by the January 6, 1993 letter from Howen to
Glenn.  The specificity of that letter in our opinion left no doubt
that investigative notes and certainly drawings by an HRT sniper
were encompassed within the request.

     Based on our investigation, we conclude that headquarters
personnel were informed of the scope of discovery sought by the
USAO yet failed to take adequate efforts to locate responsive
materials.  Dillon seeks to accept fully responsibility for this
production problem because he may not have made adequate request
for the investigative notes of the internal shooting inquiry. 
[FN1378] Howen opined to investigators that he thought it was 
unfair for Dillon to take the blame for what he believed to be 
omissions of FBI Headquarter's personnel. [FN1379]  We agree.  
Perhaps someone should have been more aggressive in formulating 
instructions to FBI headquarters and monitoring the quality of 
their response. Nevertheless, the primary responsibility in this
case must rest on the doorstep of FBI headquarters. They 
understood the requests and they were responsible for generating 
and storing the records being sought.

     We have yet to obtain clear evidence of what actual efforts
were taken by the FBI to search their files for documents
responsive to the discovery request as outlined by the USAO. 
However, our impression is that it was not a well organized search. 
Indeed, during our investigation, we found at least one document
that fell within the scope of discovery but which the FBI had not
located and produced. [FN1380]  With regard to the
shooting incident report, FBI officials argued that as a practical
matter the original investigative notes are not considered to be
part of the shooting report and that the discovery request was not
broad enough to encompass these notes. [FN1381]  We find this 
explanation unavialing since discovery request was certainly broad 
enough to encompass such notes. [FN1382] These officials indicated 
that they consider the shooting report to consist of the
report without the backup notes. [FN1383]  Also troubling is the
apparent failure of CID to consult with the Inspections Division --
which was responsible for preparing the report -- and determine if
they had retained any pertinent files. [FN1384]  David Binney, who is
the Assistant Director of the FBI Inspection Division, was very
sure that he never received a discovery request for the shooting
incident report.  Binney emphasized that because a shooting
incident report contains sensitive information the Legal Counsel
Division would have to authorize the release of the document before
it would be produced.  Accordingly, if he had received a request,
he would have forwarded it to Assistant Director Davis in the Legal
Counsel Division.  He has no recollection of making such a
referral. [FN1385]

     In addition to our concern over the quality of the FBI's
response to the discovery requests, we are distressed by the
apparent lack of coordination between the CID and LCD after the
subpoena was received.  The FBI's pretrial response to the
discovery request appears to have been handled totally by CID. We
learned that such involvement by CID in criminal discovery was
unusual. [FN1386] No evidence was found that CID ever communicated 
with LCD when it was responding to the discovery requests. 
[FN1387]

     Later, when the subpoena request arrived at FBI Headquarters,
it was handled by LCD with no apparent assistance from CID.  We
find no evidence that CID and LCD worked together to produce the
materials requested in the subpoena.

                            [GARRITY]

                [FN1388] Although the April 30 search request
prepared by Brian Callihan referenced that the report had been
produced previously, there is no indication of when Callihan
acquired that knowledge.  The only conflicting evidence of whether
CID was aware of the subpoena came from Dillon who recalled
directing the subpoena to Miller and to FBI Headquarters.  He seems
to believe that he forwarded the subpoena to CID since he recalled
speaking to Kahoe about the need to obtain the notes developed
during the investigation and that he later learned that the
subpoena had been transferred to LCD for handling.  At that time,
he recalled telling Kahoe that the investigative notes would have
to be sent to Miller in order for him to testify.  However,
Dillon's recollection conflicts with that of Brian Callihan of LCD. 
Callihan did not recall learning about the subpoena from CID but
rather from either a phone call of a facsimile on April 14 or 15, 
1993 from the Boise Resident Agency. [FN1389]

     In addition to issues associated with the thoroughness of the
FBI's response to the discovery request, we are concerned about the
nature and quality of the FBI response to the defense subpoena. It
is our view that aspects of that response could have been 
undertaken in a more responsible manner. [FN1390] At the outset, 
we are troubled that the FBI did not communicate with defense 
counsel Peterson to determine when Miller would testify. Callihan 
told investigators that he expected defense counsel to contact 
Miller. However, we think that the letter was clear that the 
obligation was upon the FBI not defense counsel to make the 
contact.  We cannot countenance the laissez-faire attitude shown 
by the FBI to its legal obligations in an ongoing federal trial. 
Indeed, we are troubled by the relaxed pace at which the FBI 
responded to the subpoena when they had not even determined a 
date for Miller's testimony.  After receiving the subpoena, 
Callihan waited two weeks before forwarding it for processing 
and when it was returned to him, he waited another ten days 
before drafting a cover letter and sending the package to the 
mail room.  Then, when he forwarded it to the mail room, he 
neglected to provide specific mailing instructions.  Finally, 
we fail to comprehend why the USAO was not consulted about 
responding to this subpoena.  None of the prosecutors in the 
USAO -- Howen, Lindquist or Ellsworth -- ever recall being told
of the subpoena or of any efforts by the FBI to assemble the 
requested materials.  Nor is thee any evidence that Dillon 
alerted the prosecutors to the existence of this particular
subpoena which was received at the same time as the subpoena for
the FBI manual. [FN1391]  The cryptic references to the USAO in a 
few notes do not suffice to establish such knowledge.

     Some of these discovery problems seem to have been caused by
the failure of the FBI to have an organized system for responding
to discovery requests.  As previously mentioned, we requested the
FBI to conduct another search of its files to ensure that all
documents responsive to the discovery obligations in the Weaver
case had been produced. [FN1392]  We made this request because of our
concern over the thoroughness and care in which the earlier
searches had been conducted.  We see a compelling need for a
centralized tracking system in the FBI that would monitor and
coordinate discovery and subpoena requests and then record actions
taken in a case.  Included in this tracking information should be
the name of the person responsible for handling the requests as
well as an identification of the files searched and the materials
produced.  Such requests should be handled by one person in one
division not by multiple persons in multiple divisions.

     In addition to improving the methodology of retrieving
responsive documents, we believe that the FBI needs to examine its
practices concerning the preservation of case related materials. 
During our investigation, there were a number of instances in which
an interviewee told us that he had prepared a document but no one
could produce a copy of it.  For example, we were told that there
were multiple drafts of the operations plan yet we only were able
to locate one draft version.  Similarly, we never located any
original facsimiles or notes of headquarters personnel that were
prepared during the crisis at Ruby Ridge.  We are troubled by the
apparent lack of a system to preserve such critical records and
believe that the FBI needs to institute a system to avoid such
omissions in the future.

          4.   Conclusion

     Although we found no intent by the FBI headquarters personnel
to violate the discovery obligations of the government, we believe
that the FBI unreasonably resisted the efforts of the USAO to
comply with their discovery responsibilities in the Weaver case. 
In addition, it appears that the FBI did not put forth its best
efforts in responding to the discovery requests or the subsequent
defense subpoena.  Indeed, the decision of the court in October
1993 to fine the FBI for its intransigence on
various discovery issues is consistent with our conclusion. 
Although the facts giving rise to the problems in the Weaver case
may be unique, we believe that serious organization problems exist
and must be corrected.  There is a critical need in the future to
improve the quality of the response of the FBI to discovery
demands.  Such improvement must include establishing an organized
system of responding to and monitoring discovery requests and
improving the coordination among FBI components.

     W. Douglas Gow, Associate Deputy Director of the FBI,
requested that this document be prepared in response to a call
from Henry Hudson who asked him whether he "had any thought about
the handling of [the Weaver] crisis or crisis in general." 
Hudson told Gow that as the new Director of the USMS he would
appreciate any ideas that Gow could provide.  Thereafter, John
Uda was assigned the task of preparing the document.  From the
instructions that he received, Uda understood that he was
identifying talking points that Coulson and Hudson would want
discuss about the Weaver/Harris matter.  Uda emphasized that

that the USAO had made two previous requests for all FBI
documents pertaining to the Weaver case but that these requests
had been handled by the Resident Agency in Boise and the Criminal

     1362 Glenn told investigators that he believed to the extent
that any controversies arose over certain documents such as the
shooting incident report, he attributed them to differences
between the FBI Headquarters and the USAO.  With regard to those
controversial documents that were controlled by FBI Headquarters,
Glenn stated that he was simply a conduit transmitting the
request and had no role in the decision of whether the document 
would be produced in discovery.  Glenn Sworn Statement, at 35-37.

     1363 Howen attributed the resistance to producing these
documents to FBI Headquarters rather than the local FBI office.

case agents were very diligent and helpful in assisting with 
discovery except when they were under contrary instructions from 
superiors.  Lindquist interview, Tape 5, at 31.

     1364 Special Agent Rampton believed that there was an
unnecessary delay in producing the shooting incident report and
the operations plan.  He could understand the need of the USAO for
these documents and did not believe that there was anything in
the documents harmful to FBI interests.  Rampton FD-302, at 36. 
Although he did not think that the conclusions of the report were
relevant to the issues in the Weaver prosecution, Davis conceded
that the factual content of the report probably rendered it
subject to discovery.  Davis FD-302, at 5.  Lindquist recalled that
Rampton, Venkus and Dillon agreed with him that there was no
reason not to produce the report.  Lindquist believed that they had
recommended to FBI Headquarters that the report be released. 
However, they indicated to Lindquist that they were encountering
significant resistance from FBI Headquarters regarding the

     1376 Howen stated that on a number of occasions that the USAO
made both written and oral requests of the FBI to produce all
materials having any relevance to the Weaver matter.  These
requests were made to the FBI office in Boise and presumably
relayed to FBI Headquarters.  Howen said that they also told
members of the Terrorism and Violent Crime Section of DOJ that they
suspected that there was some type of file on the shooting incident
report and that they wanted access to everything.  Howen Interview,

     1378 Dillon FD-302, at 9-10.  Joseph Davis, Assistant Director
of LCD also appears to assign responsibility for the problem to
Dillon.  Davis believes that the primary responsibility for
responding to criminal discovery in the FBI usually rests with the
office of origin and, in those situation when responsive documents
are located elsewhere, it is the responsibility of the office of
origin "to set appropriate leads to insure their timely
production."  Davis FD-302, at 5-6.

response of the FBI to the crisis at Ruby Ridge.  Included as
topics for discussion were deployment problems, tactical issues and
negotiation issues.  Gale Evans FD-302, at 3-4.  As a precautionary
measure, we requested the FBI to search its files again at
Headquarters and at the field offices involved in responding to the
Weaver crisis to determine if any additional responsive documents
existed.  This search resulted in the location of one document that
had not been previously identified and produced.  However, this
document did not contain any information significant to the issues
examined in this investigation.

     1382 [GARRITY]

     1383 Howen stated that when he viewed and finally received the
shooting incident report he never thought to ask the FBI for
material in the 1-A file.  He told investigators that because it
was an internal investigation, he did not know if the 1-A procedure
was being followed.  Howen Interview, Tape 9, at 21.

     1384 The Inspection Division of the FBI is responsible for
conducting a shooting incident review when requested by another
division.  When the review is completed, the report is sent to the
requesting division.  According to Paul Philip, the Inspector
Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI Inspection Division, once the
Inspection Division forwards this report to the requesting
division, that division becomes the owner of the report and has the
right to decide whether the report should be released.  FD-302

I of the Legal Counsel Division, was certain that LCD was not

Similarly, Austin Anderson, Unit Chief of the Investigative Law
Unit of the LCD, did not recall ever participating in any

case.  He told investigators that Gale Evans, the Unit Chief of the
VCMO Unit, confirmed that he had no notes or records indicating
that Anderson had discussed any discovery issues with him.

intentionally trying to impede the process."  Lindquist Interview,
Tape 5, at 21.  We found no evidence to support this suspicion.

     1391 See Section IV(O) for a discussion of the response of the
FBI to the subpoenas for manual provisions and personnel files. 
Joseph Davis recalls one phone call with Ellsworth in which
Ellsworth informed him of the defense request for the manual
provisions as well as the shooting incident report.  Ellsworth was
unable to tell Davis when these requests were made or when they
were due.  As a result of this conversation, Davis sent an
electronic mail message to Beau McFarland around April 26, 1993
requesting him to investigate the matter and to make sure that FBI
was responding appropriately.  Davis FD-302, at 5-6.  However, in
that message, Davis wrote only about the subpoena 
for the manual provisions; no mention was made of the subpoena for
the shooting incident report.  Memorandum from Davis to McFarland,
April 27, 1993.

IV. SPECIFIC ISSUES INVESTIGATED

N.   Alleged Problems With the Participation of the FBI in 
Case Preparation and Its Relationship With Other
Members of the Trial Preparation Team

          1.   Introduction

     One of the issues that arose as the various law enforcement
entities converges at Ruby Ridge was which agency had the primary
responsibility for planning, organizing and coordinating the
activities of law enforcement personnel.  It was decided early in
the crisis that the FBI would have the lead role in the operations
at Ruby Ridge.  However, after Weaver and Harris surrendered, the
focus shifted from crisis resolution to trials preparation and the
U.S. Attorney's Office in Boise ("USAO") assumed the lead role. 
Initially, the FBI believed that it was to be the sole agency
assisting the USAO in trial preparation.  Later, for reasons that
the USAO and the FBI dispute, agents from the U.S. Marshals Service
and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms ("BATF") were
assigned by their respective agencies to assist the USAO.

     The FBI believed that the addition of these agents was
unnecessary, improper and was accomplished in a less than
forthright manner by the USAO.  The arrival of the marshals and the
BATF agents coupled with disagreements over how witness interviews
in Iowa were to be conducted worsened the already fragile working
relationship between the FBI and the USAO.  Thereafter, various
actions and attitudes of the investigative team created significant
discord between the FBI and the other team members.  In addition,
the USAO alleges that their efforts to prepare their case for trial
were also hampered by the failure of officials at FBI Headquarters
to make themselves available for interviews.

          2.   Statement of Facts

a.   Defining the Structure of the Trial Team and
the Role and Responsibilities of the Individual
Members

(1)  The Lead Agency Concept and the Initial
Disagreement Regarding the Interviewing of
Witnesses in Iowa

     As the various law enforcement agencies arrived at Ruby Ridge
on August 21 and August 22, 1992, it quickly became evident that
there was a need for one agency to assume the leadership role
during the crisis.  Because the assault of a federal officer charge
fell within the jurisdiction of the FBI, it was decided that it was
appropriate for the FBI to perform this role.  Once the crisis was
over, and the focus had shifted to trial preparation, Assistant
U.S. Attorney Howen believed that the leadership 
role was transferred from the FBI to the USAO. [FN1393] 
Although Howen and Assistant U.S. Attorney Lindquist would
entertain suggestions from the FBI, they viewed themselves as the
"captains' responsible for directing case preparation and any
additional investigative activities that were necessary. [FN1394]

     From the outset, tensions existed between the FBI and the
USAO.  A number of early incidents intensified the growing
animosity between the two government entities.  One of these
incidents centered around the request of the USAO to transport the
birthing shed on the Weaver property from Ruby Ridge to Boise.  The
USAO argued that it was important to have the shed accessible to
permit the testing and use of the shed at trial. [FN1395] The FBI
disagreed and maintained that the shed was not necessary and that
the transportation and storage costs were too high.  The FBI
ultimately agreed to transport the shed to Boise.  Later, when it
became apparent that the USAO would not be using the shed, the FBI
questioned whether the initial request to transport the shed had
been well considered. [FN1395]

     Another issue that created controversy concerned the
conducting of witness interviews in Iowa.  Howen had informed the
FBI case agents that to support the conspiracy theory it was
important to interview witnesses in Iowa who knew Weaver before he
moved to Idaho.  Howen and Lindquist wanted one of the case agents
to conduct these interviews since they believed that they best
understood the facts and nuances of the case. [FN1397]

[GARRITY]

[FN1398] However, the FBI informed the USAO that a 

[GARRITY]

case agent could be sent to handle an important interview or a
followup interview. [FN1399]

     At a September 28, 1992 meeting, Special Agents Venkus and
Rampton advised Howen that they were going to send out leads to
Iowa.  According to Venkus, Howen expressed no opposition to this
plan. [FN1400]  On the next day, Howen gave Venkus a list of 
witnessesb for the FBI to interview [FN1401] and noted on the list 
that he wanted "clean 302s." [FN1402]  Soon after Venkus sent out 
the leads, Howen told him that he had misunderstood his 
instructions and that he had just wanted to have the addresses of 
the prospective witnesses updated. [FN1403]

     Ellsworth protested this action to Special Agent in Charge
Eugene Glenn and argued that the agents had only been instructed to
conduct "background leads" which consisted of identifying

[GARRITY]

individuals and places of residence. [FN1404]  Howen, who did not 
recall instructing Rampton to send out the leads, explained to 
Rampton that he did not want the leads conducting the interviews 
because of the animosity existing between the people being 
interviewed -- many of whom were friends or supporters of the 
Weavers -- and the FBI because he wanted to avoid creating a paper 
trail of FD-302's which would reveal his case preparation strategy 
to the defense.  He told Rampton that if the FBI were going to 
conduct the interviews, he wanted the case agents who were 
familiar with the case to handle it. [FN1405]  Lindquist 
instructed Dillon to stop all of these interviews and that if he 
failed to do so, the interviews would have to be redone. [FN1406]

     At some point during this time period, Howen informed Rampton
that he wanted to participate in the Iowa interviews and that he
would not have to generate interview reports. [FN1407]  Rampton told
Howen that Iowa FBI agents would be conducting these interviews. 
One week later, Lindquist informed Rampton that the Marshals
Service had offered them two marshals to assist with the case and
that they had accepted the offer. [FN1408]

     A third dispute between the USAO and the FBI involved [G.J.]
Lindquist explained that it was an essential part of the
government's case to show what had occurred at Ruby Ridge on August
22 as well as on August 21.  Part of this proof consisted of

[G.J.] [GARRITY] [FN1415]

[GARRITY] [FN1416]

[FN1417]

[G.J.]

[FN1418]  Howen viewed this incident as the "defining moment" 
when the working relationship between the USAO and the FBI on 
the Weaver case "was over." [FN1419]

(2)  The Decision to Assign Members of the
Marshals Service and BATF to Assist in
Case Preparation 

     In late October 1992, Deputy Marshals Robert Masaitis and John
Stafford were assigned to assist the USAO in the preparation of the
Weaver case for trial.  At around the same time, BATF also assigned
two special agents -- Herbert Byerly and Jane Hefner [FN1420]-- to
assist the USAO.  Various accounts were provided to investigators
as to who was responsible for assigning the marshals to assist in
the preparation of the case.  Some individuals, including FBI
members, believe that the U.S. Attorney or someone in that office
had made the request [FN1421] while others insist that Director Henry
Hudson volunteered the services of the marshals.  Hudson told us
that he assigned the marshals to the case sometime in October 
1992 after he had a telephone discussion with Ellsworth during 
which Ellsworth complained about the FBI. [FN1422]  However, according 
to Ellsworth and Howen, Hudson offered the assistance of the 
marshals and they accepted the offer. [FN1423] Lindquist remembers 
the incident differently and believes that he first presented the 
proposal to Tony Perez and that the final acceptance of his proposal 
occurred during an October 1992 meeting with Hudson. [FN1424]

     In addition to who precipitated the inclusion of the Marshals
Service and the BATF in the case of preparation, was the issue of
why it was necessary to include them.  The perception among some
was that the USAO was unhappy with the performance and attitude of
the FBI including their refusal to have case agents cover leads
[FN1425] and their failure to accomplish the tasks assigned them. 
[FN1426] Howen insisted that the decision to bring the marshals 
into the case had nothing to do with any disagreement with the FBI 
but rather was because the USAO needed the help. [FN1427] Ellsworth,
who maintained that he had always envisioned the BATF and the 
Marshals Service as having a role in the Weaver case, agreed 
that the decision was influenced by the need for more assistance in
preparing the case.  He was also concerned that the FBI decision to
send leads to conduct out of state interviews indicated that they
were not devoting enough resources to the matter.  He was
particularly concerned because the agents, in contrast to the
marshals, were not based in Boise but rather hundreds of miles away
in Northern Idaho.  Furthermore, the availability of Venkus was
potentially threatened by the demands created by the illness of his
mother.[FN1428]  Lindquist stated that in addition to needing more
help, [FN1429] the presence of the marshals and the BATF agents
demonstrated to the jury a united effort by the government.[FN1430]
Rampton disagreed that the USAO needed the help and maintained 
that there was insufficient work for all of these agents. [FN1431]

     The FBI was also displeased by the failure of the USAO to
consult with them and to inform them of the decision until after
the agents had begun working in Boise.  Ellsworth could not recall
how the FBI was informed about the addition of the marshals.  He
argued that the marshals were always a part of the case and,
indeed, their involvement had preceded that of the FBI.  He
believed that the only change was that two marshals were being
brought in to substitute for Cooper and Hunt who had an obvious
conflict since they were witnesses to the events at issue. [FN1432] 
Howen did not have a clear recollection of how he informed Venkus
and Rampton but suspected it was about the same time that he told
them that they were going to be working together as a team with the
USAO as the chief decision maker. [FN1433]  Lindquist believes that he
told Venkus and Rampton that he had asked the Marshals Service
about providing marshals to assist in the case preparation and that
they were being made available. [FN1434]

     When Rampton first learned that the marshals would be working
on the case he expressed his concern to Lindquist.  According to
Rampton, Lindquist responded that the decision had already been
made and that it was not a Bureau decision.  Later Rampton learned
that the marshals had been in Boise for a week and had been
conferring with the Howen and Lindquist at the time that he first
learned that they would be working on the case. [FN1435]  Dillon 
said that when he called Lindquist and voiced his displeasure, 
Lindquist responded that he did not have to tell Dillon anything 
and that "you guys can't work with anyone." [FN1436] Thereafter, 
Glenn sent Ellsworth a letter protesting the bringing in of the 
marshals to which Ellsworth responded. [FN1437] Rampton stated that 
BATF Agent Byerly was also brought into the investigation without
the knowledge of the FBI. [FN1438]

     With the addition of the marshals and BATF agents to the team,
issues also arose as to what tasks these agents would be performing
and to whom they would be reporting.  Some in the FBI initially
understood that these agents would be assisting in case preparation
but would not be conducting any investigatory activities. [FN1439] 
According to Hudson, Ellsworth told him that he wanted the deputy
marshals to participate in conducting the investigation.  Hudson
expressed reservations about this plan because he did not believe
that any statutory authority existed for this role and he was
concerned that Ellsworth might use the deputy marshals as leverage
against the FBI.  To guard against such a result, Hudson had Duke
Smith work out the details with Mike Dillon with the understanding
that the marshals were to support the FBI but receive their
instructions from the USAO. [FN1440]  Deputy Marshal Stafford had a
somewhat different understanding.  He believed that his
responsibilities would include conducting interviews, locating
witnesses and preparing backgrounds of the defendants. [FN1441]  
Rampton said that Lindquist told him that the marshals would do 
whatever came up in the investigation. [FN1442]  Ellsworth agreed 
with this statement and acknowledged that he had initially 
envisioned that the marshals might be conducting 
interviews. [FN1443]

     The FBI officials always considered the Bureau to be the lead
investigative agency.  Accordingly, it believed that the other
agents would report to and through them.  For example, it was
Rampton's initial understanding that the Marshals Service had
assured Dillon that the marshals would be assigned to the FBI. 
Rampton said this plan was never followed. [FN1444] Dillon told 
Venkus that FBI Headquarters had confirmed that the marshals were 
to report to the FBI and were not to conduct any investigation or
interviews without the approval and knowledge of the FBI. [FN1443]
When the FBI realized that the USAO was adamant that the FBI would
not be the lead agency and that the other agents would not report
through it, the FBI was outraged and responded that it was "their
investigation" and that "they would proceed as they deemed
necessary." [FN1446]

     Chief Deputy Marshal Ronald Evans originally understood that
Masaitis and Stafford would be assisting FBI case agents Venkus and
Rampton. [FN1447]  However, Hudson stated that while the marshals would
be assisting the efforts of the FBI he intended that they would
receive their orders from the USAO. [FN1448]  Stafford was told by his
superiors that he would be working as a team member with the FBI as
opposed to working for the FBI. [FN1449]  Similarly, Masaitis was told
that he was being assigned to assist the USAO and was never told
that he would be working under FBI direction. [FN1450]

     Howen and Lindquist always intended the agents to work on
teams as equal partners and to report directly to them not
through the FBI. [FN1451]  The plan was for each of the agencies to be
responsible for three counts of the indictment as well as some of
the overt acts of the conspiracy. [FN1452]  Howen anticipated that the
Marshals Service and the BATF agents would assist in case
preparation as well as perform some investigatory tasks. [FN1453] 
However, Howen stated that the FBI resisted this approach and
wanted to be a "buffer" between the USAO and the other
agencies. [FN1454]  Ellsworth did not have a clear recollection on this
issue but thought that there may have been an initial understanding
that the FBI case agents would be the intermediary between the USAO
and the marshals. [FN1455]

     The FBI also questioned the jurisdictional authority of the
Marshals Service to be investigating certain counts of the
indictment.  Glenn maintained that the FBI had primary jurisdiction
over all counts in the indictment because the assault on a federal
officer charges were the main offenses alleged in the indictment
and the other charges were "lesser included offenses."  In this
regard, Glenn argued that "[t]he FBI has always retained primary
jurisdiction when other crimes have arisen out of a substantive
violation over which the FBI has jurisdiction" and that [i]t would
not be cost effective to include numerous agencies whenever an
investigation results in lesser included offenses." [FN1456] 
Ellsworth noted in his response to Glenn that he was correct that 
the FBI had primary investigative jurisdiction over the federal 
officer assault count but reminded Glenn that the FBI did not have
exclusive jurisdiction over all counts in the indictment. Ellsworth
accused Glenn of being myopic when he advocated that the FBI had 
exclusive jurisdiction since the other agencies had a vested 
interest in the case and should be permitted to participate "on 
the same footing as the Bureau.' [FN1457]

                    (3) The First Team Meeting

     Howen and Lindquist convened the first team meeting in Post
Falls, Idaho on October 30, 1992. [FN1458]  The parties memories 
differ somewhat as to the tone of this first meeting and what was
discussed.  Howen and BATF Agent Byerly recalled it as an
organizational meeting where the team approach was discussed and
responsibilities were assigned for the various counts of the
indictment and the overt acts of the conspiracy. [FN1459] Byerly
thought that all participants were enthusiastic at this first
meeting. [FN1460]  Deputy Marshal Stafford had a different 
impression. He recalled FBI agents Venkus and Rampton as being 
"very formal and chilly." [FN1461]  Deputy Marshal Masaitis 
sensed that Rampton and Venkus were unhappy about the Marshals 
Service being involved in the case. [FN1462]  Venkus told 
investigators that it was not until he arrived at the meeting 
that he realized that BATF Agent Byerly would also be assisting 
in the case preparation. [FN1463]

     Among the topics discussed at the first meeting were the
organization of the case preparation effort and the
responsibilities of the individual team members.  Howen and
Lindquist informed the agents that each agency would be responsible
for three counts of the indictment and for some of the overt acts
alleged in the conspiracy.  The BATF was responsible for the
original gun charges; the Marshals Service was responsible for the
failure to appear charge; and the FBI was responsible for the
assault of a federal officer charge.  The agents were to work in
teams and to report to Howen or Lindquist. [FN1464]

     Another subject discussed was the conducting of interviews in
Iowa.  Rampton recalled that Howen indicated the need to do
additional interviews in order to develop information that could be
presented to the grand jury.  Rampton interpreted these comments as
a request and sent a teletype asking that leads be sent.

b.   Specific Problems in Case Preparation
Interviews Conducted by the Marshals Service
and BATF Agents

     During the pretrial period, members of the investigative team
had several discussions concerning the conducting of out of state
interviews and whether these interviews should be documented. 
Lindquist recalled Howen expressing concern that if these
interviews were documented that they would have to be produced
under the open discovery policy and such a disclosure would alert
the defense to the manner in which the prosecution was preparing
its case.  According to Lindquist, Howen then asked the FBI case
agents if they could conduct an inquiry without generating a report
and then review the substance of the interview with him to
determine if any exculpatory or otherwise discoverable information
had been learned.  Lindquist understood that if such information
had been discovered Howen intended to have a report written and to
produce the information to the defense.  Lindquist recalled that
Rampton and Venkus stated that such an approach was "probably" not
a bad idea but that Bureau policy required them to generate a 302. 
At that point, Stafford and Masaitis stated that they were not
mandated to create such forms and would be able to proceed as 
Howen had proposed. [FN1465] Lindquist had no problem with the 
approach because he was convinced of Howen's integrity and knew 
that if any Brady material were uncovered that Howen would 
produce it. [FN1466] 

  At some point, Masaitis remembered that after FBI agents
had conducted some interviews in Iowa and obtained negative
results, the USAO suggested that Stafford interview these
witnesses again. The FBI opposed the suggestion. [FN1467] 
Stafford suggested at the team meeting that he "conduct [the]
investigation like cases [he] had worked as a pre trial
investigative arm of the United States Attorney's Office in the
past." Stafford said he tried "to prepare witnesses to talk to
the U.S. Attorney prior to trial and not write reports on it.~ 
According to Stafford, it is the normal practice of the U.S.
Marshal`Marshal's Service when "doing a case" to document
interviews and information acquired for lead purposes. However,
if they are assisting the U.S. Attorney's Office in preparing a
case for trial or the grand jury, that form is not used. [FN1468] 
Stafford claimed that Howen and Lindquist reacted favorably to
this suggestion. [FN1469] He does not recall them stating that
it would be "a good idea not to produce paper." [FN1470] 

  Venkus recalled that in one team meeting Stafford told
the participants that he could conduct an interview without
creating discoverable documentation. In response, Venkus
advised Stafford that this was contrary to FBI policy and that
he disagreed with the suggestion. Venkus thought that Stafford
prided himself on not having to create paper like the FBI. fn
1471 

  Rampton thought that the documentation issue was first
raised by Howen and Lindquist. He stated that they wanted
investigation done, especially in Iowa, and that they did not
want any interview documentation created so as to avoid having
to produce it in discovery. Because of the FBI's practice of
documenting all interviews with a 302, Rampton stated that Howen
and Lindquist decided that the marshals would do the Iowa
interview since they had "volunteered" not to produce paper on
the interview. Rampton expressed concern about this plan to
Dillon, as well as to Howen and Lindquist. Thereafter, Howen
and Lindquist qualified their instructions to the FBI and said
that they should continue to document their interviews as they
had in the past. [FN1472] Rampton had suggested tot Howen that
FBI agents in Iowa do the interviews and then, if necessary,
Howen, who wanted to participate in the interviews, could do a
followup. According to Rampton, Howen and Lindquist wanted the
marshals to do the Iowa interviews and Rampton disagreed,
stating that those interviews were an FBI function. [FN1473] 

  Howen stated that when it became apparent to him that the
FBI would not allow its case agents to conduct the out of state
interviews, he thought that perhaps the marshals could do it. 
He then asked Stafford if he could conduct the interviews and
whether he was required to prepare written documentation. 
Stafford told Howen that he could conduct the interviews and
that he was not required to document it. [FN1474] Thereafter,
Howen had the marshals and the BATF agent serve subpoenas and
conduct witness interviews. 

  Stafford said that Howen and Lindquist asked him to serve
approximately 100 subpoenas and to conduct interviews of
individuals in Iowa, Northern Idaho, Oregon, Spokane, Washington
and Denver, Colorado. [FN1475] Most of these interviews were
conducted in Iowa. Stafford thought that the FBI did not want
to participate in these interviews because they had other things
to do. However, he did not know whether the FBI agents had ever
been asked to conduct the interviews. [FN1476] He did believe
that the FBI agents knew what he would be doing since before he
left to conduct the Iowa interviews he informed Mike Dillon about
his anticipated activities. [FN1477] 

  While serving subpoenas, Stafford said he would conduct
interview of those individuals being served. One such interview
was of Howard Brashure in Iowa who was developed as an
informant/witness. [FN1478] Stafford explained that because
this was a high profile case, identifying information about the
witness was not placed on the subpoena but rather on a separate
sheet of paper attached to the subpoena. [FN1479] Stafford
wrote down on this sheet any information that he received during
the interview that he judged to be important as well as
providing his impression of the person as a witness. 
Thereafter, he mailed the sheets back to the U.S. Attorney's
Office. Stafford did not know whether any of these sheets were
ever produced to the defense although he said he was not aware
of any exculpatory material not being turned over to the
defense. [FN1480] A review of the discovery records in the
Weaver case revealed that other than the cryptic notes on some
of the subpoena cover sheets, Stafford did not document these
interviews and that these sheets were not produced in discovery. 

  Howen said that Stafford knew whom to interview based on
the subpoenas that were given to him. According to Howen, the
goal was to ask questions that would determine whether a person
should or should not be a witness. [FN1481] Howen told
investigators that he did not instruct Stafford to as specific
questions of the subpoenaed parties but rather informed him of
general subject areas that were important to case development. 
These areas included: the Weavers' activities primarily during
the 1983-85 time period; any information about Weaver's alleged
plan to build a 300 yard kill zone; and identifying any other
witnesses who might be helpful and Howen might want to interview
personally. [FN1482] When Stafford returned from serving the
subpoenas he would brief Howen on the information that he had 
learned. [FN1483] Howen insisted that he never instructed
Stafford no to create documentation but rather used Stafford
because he understood that it was the policy of the Marshals
Service not to create documentation for this type of interview. 
fn 1484 Howen never discussed with Stafford what constituted
exculpatory information nor did Stafford ever raise the issue. 
Howen assumed that Stafford understood the nature of exculpatory
information based upon his experience in the Marshals Service. 
Howen never remembered Stafford conveying to him any exculpatory
information from the interviews conducted in Iowa. [FN1485] 

  Lindquist stated that Howen was primarily responsible for
giving Stafford any instructions regarding the serving of the
subpoenas and the interview questions to be asked. [FN1486] To
the extent that Lindquist gave Stafford instructions, they were
general in nature and intended to obtain information that would
reveal the type of person that Weaver was. [FN1487] Lindquist
did not recall any specific instructions given concerning the
documentation of these interviews although he assumed that the
documentation issue had been resolved at the earlier meeting. 
[FN1488] It was not until before trial that Lindquist learned
who had been interviewed in Iowa. [FN1489] 

  BATF Agent Byerly did not conduct any interviews in Iowa. 
[FN1490] However, he did participate with Stafford, BATF Agent
Gunderson, Deputy Marshal Hunt and Sheriff Whittaker in serving
subpoenas on 20-40 people in Northern Idaho [FN1491] who 
were neighbors of the Weavers and in conducting "related
interviews." [FN1492] Byerly could not recall Howen or
Lindquist requesting them to conduct interviews without
documenting them. [FN1493] With regard to the interviews that
Byerly conducted, he told investigators that he told the witness
"to tell the truth and cooperate with both the prosecution and
the defense." [FN1494] Of the conversations that he had with
witnesses, Byerly said he prepared approximately five or six
interview reports. His criterion for whether an interview
report was necessary was whether the new information would help
the prosecution or the defense. [FN1495] 

  Masaitis did not conduct any interviews in Iowa but did
conduct several interviews while assisting the USAO. Because
none of these interviews produced any positive information,
Masaitis did not document them. Masaitis said it is his
practice to only document an interview if significant
information is developed. He denied that the USAO ever
instructed him not to document the interviews. [FN1496] 
Masaitis never considered his actions "as conducting
investigation." [FN1497] 

  Rampton and Venkus said that they were never informed
about when the Iowa interviews were conducted or about the
results of these interviews. Indeed, it was not until later
that the FBI case agents learned of them. [FN1498] Glenn did
not learn about these interviews until after the trial 
when the case agents told him that some of these interviews 
had been conducted without their knowledge. [FN1499] Rampton 
said that the Iowa interviews were done primarily to support 
the conspiracy count but also developed information to 
support other counts. [FN1500] He did not know whether these 
interviews produced any exculpatory information. [FN1501] 

  There is no record of what the Iowa witnesses told
Stafford. Howen insisted that if these interviews had produced
exculpatory information he would have produced it to the
defense. [FN1502] To the extent that he was informed of the
information, Lindquist never learned of any Brady information
being disclosed in these interviews. [FN1503] Although Venkus
did not know the specifics of what Stafford had learned in the
interviews, he suspected that some of it was of significance. 
For example, he recalled hearing Stafford discussing
"voluminous" information that a witness had given him about the
John Todd tapes and the concept of "Illuminating." Venkus
believed that Stafford viewed the Todd tapes as a critical link
in the proof required to show the origins of Weaver's alleged
conspiracy. [FN1504] 

  (2) Acoustical Test 

  The marshals involved in the August 21, 1992 shooting at
Ruby Ridge reported receiving a hundred or more incoming rounds. 
However, investigators recovered far fewer bulled casings. Some
theorized that echoes may have caused it to sound as if more
rounds had been fired. Another important issues in the case was
who fired the first shot. Deputy Marshal Norris had reported
hearing a shot that sounded like it came from the type of gun
that Roderick and Degan were carrying. This conflicted with
Cooper's version of events which was that Harris had fired the
first shot. Thereafter, the USAO and members of the 
investigative team discussed the need to conduct an acoustical
test to explain these arguably conflicting findings. [FN1505] 

  Lindquist believed that he first identified the need to
consider whether an acoustical test should be conducted. [FN1506]
He recalled discussing the issue and that he and Rampton
took some steps to determine if there was an expert at the FBI
that would address the issue. At some point, Lindquist recalled
discussing the issue with someone and the FBI laboratory. He
remembered that this individual thought that it would be
difficult to control the environment sufficiently so as to be
confident that the were duplicating the acoustical reality as it
existed on August 21, 1992. [FN1507] Lindquist recalled that he
was not completely satisfied with the response given by the
individual from the FBI lab and had the impression that the
individual had not given adequate consideration to his
questions. Soon thereafter, Lindquist spoke with a federal
prosecutor in Los Angeles who confirmed that it was difficult to
control all of the factors so as to be comfortable with the
accuracy of an acoustical test. [FN1508] Thereafter, Lindquist
suggested to a team member that when they accompanied Lucian
Haag to Ruby Ridge to work on the shooting reconstruction that
they might want to fire a few rounds to see what they heard. 
Thereafter, he understood that this was done and that those
present could reach no conclusions as to the effect of echoes or
whether it was possible to distinguish the weapons being fired. 
fn 1509 

  Rampton confirmed that on approximately October 21, 1992,
he had discussed with Lindquist the need to have and acoustical
test conducted to determine what echoes or reverberations were
caused by the firing of weapons like those involved in the
August 21st shootings. Thereafter, Rampton communicated with
the FBI Laboratory about having the test conducted. [FN1510] 
Following this initial contact, Rampton and Lindquist had
several phone conversations with Supervisory Special Agent Bruce
Koenig who was assigned to the FBI's Engineering Research
Facility in Quantico, Virginia, about the feasibility of
conducting an acoustical analysis of the gunshots fired at the
top of the mountain at Ruby Ridge. Koenig understood that the
Assistant U.S. Attorney with whom he spoke was anxious to 
determine if echoes could have accounted for the difference 
between the number of shots heard by the marshals and the 
number of casings found. He told the attorney that certain 
structures such as cliffs would cause echoes and recommended 
positioning listeners at the various locations where the 
marshals reported being and then firing multiple shots in 
various directions and from various locations to listen 
to the effect. Koenig told the attorney that he was
willing to travel to Ruby Ridge and conduct the test firings. 
Indeed, arrangements were made for Koenig and his team to fly to
Idaho but at the last minute either Rampton or the attorney
contacted him and told him that the trip was unnecessary because
they had conducted the tests and no echoes were heard. [FN1511] 

  Masaitis recalled learning that the FBI had expressed
some resistance to conducting the test. The other team members
then explored the option of hiring an expert to conduct the test
but learned that this option would be too costly. At that
point, they decided to conduct their own informal experiment. 
[FN1512] 

  At the end of October, Howen, Stafford, Masaitis, Hunt
and Bruce Whittaker from the Boundary County Sheriff Department
travelled to Ruby Ridge to participate in an acoustical test
which consisted of firing weapons similar to those belonging to
the marshals involved in the August 21st shooting. Stafford
believes that Venkus and Rampton were asked to accompany the
group but did not do so. [FN1513] Once everyone assumed their
positions, Masaitis fired some rounds from the rock outcropping
adjacent to the Weaver house while Hunt was down by the & areas. 
fn 1514 Shots were also fired from the & and the area where
Sammy started his retreat back to the cabin. [FN1515] Howen
could not recall if the marshals present made any comments about
how the shots sounded. [FN1516] Although Masaitis could not hear
echoes because he was firing the gun, he recalled that someone
had stated that they had heard echoes. [FN1517] All parties
involved in this test stated that no record, either audio or
written, was produced. [FN1518] 

  At the initial team meeting on October 30, 1992,
Lindquist announced that the test had been completed and that
the FBI laboratory did not need to conduct the examination.[FN1519]
He was not aware that at the time Rampton was still in the
process of locating an FBI expert to conduct an acoustical test. 
[FN1520] Rampton, who was informed of this acoustical experiment
after it had been completed, was surprised by the unscientific
methodology used. [FN1521] Howen explained that he decided not
to pursue an expert opinion since he questioned whether an
expert would be able to provide an accurate opinion since any
test that he would conduct would be after the leaves had fallen
from the deciduous trees thus rendering the conditions different
from those present at Ruby Ridge on August 21, 1992. [FN1522] 

  The USAO never informed defense counsel about this
experiment. [FN1523] Lindquist explained that he did not think
this rudimentary experiment, which used neither an expert or
equipment, constituted the type of activity that was required to
be disclosed under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16. He characterized their
activities as "preliminary" to see if a formal test might be
warranted. [FN1524] Howen agreed this was not a test and was 
something that anyone, including the defense, could have
conducted. [FN1525] 

  (3) Cooperation and Trust Among Trial Team Members 

   (i) Historical Problems in the Working Relationship Between 
the USAO and the FBI 

  Almost everyone questioned about the subject agreed that
the USAO and FBI experienced numerous problems in their working
relationship during the Weaver prosecution. However, these
problems did not originate with the Weaver matter but rather
appear to have been developing over a number of years. Indeed,
many individuals in the USAO and the FBI agreed that the two
agencies had a history of a poor relationship which deteriorated
further in the Weaver matter. 

  From the FBI perspective, Supervisory Special Agent
Dillon felt that there were numerous incidents which contributed
to the problems. He stated that one factor was Howen's
personality which because noticeably hostile to the FBI after
the prosecution of Randy Baldwin. [FN1526] Dillon characterized
Howen's personality after the Baldwin case as being "very
pompous and condescending." Problems between Howen and the Fbi
continued when the two offices strongly disagreed over whether a
local sheriff from Shoshone County should be prosecuted for
public corruption. The FBI ultimately presented the case to the
Department of Justice for consideration. Thereafter, the Public
Integrity Section of the Criminal Division of the Department of
Justice prosecuted the matter -- the first trial ended in a hung
jury while the second trial ended with an acquittal. According
to Dillon, Howen and Ellsworth were extremely upset over the
handling of that case. [FN1527] Dillon told investigators that
one major criticism that he and others had about Howen was that
he would discuss and issue with the FBI or give an instruction
to the FBI and then later forget the discussion or having given
the instruction. Howen would then portray the FBI action as
being contrary to his wishes. Dillon gave as an example a 1990
case involving the arrest of Aryan Nation members with the
arrest scenario proposed by the FBI. According to Dillon, 
Howen repeatedly complained "who was working for who" [FN1528] 

  Special Agent in Charge Glenn reported that the
relationship between the USAO and the FBI had been strained for
"some time" and "seemed to deteriorate" further with the Weaver
prosecution. as examples of prior disagreements between the two
offices he pointed to several cases in which the USAO had
concluded that a case lacked prosecutive merit but subsequent
review by the Department of Justice had concluded otherwise.
[FN1529] 

  U.S. Attorney Ellsworth agreed that the relationship
between the USAO and Glenn and Dillon had not been the best. He
attributed this problem in part to the case involving the
Shoshone County Sheriff. Although the two offices managed to
work together on matters, Ellsworth stated that the relationship
was one characterized "by pleasantries and ... cordiality at a
very superficial surface level ... but one where we never really
... were able to ... deal with hard issues. [FN1530] Lindquist
was the only member of the USAO and the FBI who stated that
there was not a history of problems between the USAO and the
FBI. Lindquist insisted that the Weaver case was an anomaly and
that before and after the Weaver case he has had a "marvelous
relationship" with the FBI. [FN1531] To the extent there existed
any bad blood" between the FBI and the USAO he characterized it
as "bad blood" between Ellsworth and Dillon who did not get
along. [FN1532] this statement seems inconsistent with the
statements of other individuals interviewed including Special
Agent Wayne F. Manis who provided a 13-page chronology of a
problem that he had with Lindquist which indicated Lindquist's
knowledge of the animosity between the USAO, especially USA
Ellsworth, and Dillon and Glenn that had occurred over the
handling of the prosecution of the Shoshone County Sheriff.
[FN1533] 

  Officials at FBI headquarters were aware that there were
problems in the working relationship between the USAO and the
local and district offices of the FBI. This knowledge was based 
largely on the controversy over the public corruption case
involving the Shoshone County Sheriff. [GARRITY] [FN1534] Other
than this incident, we found no indication that FBI Headquarters
had intervened. 

   (ii) Problems in the Working Relationship Among Team Members 

  From the moment that the USAO and the FBI began working
on the Weaver case problems surfaced in their historical
hostilities. Much of the difficulty can be traced to their
negative perceptions that each agency had developed from working
together on prior matters. The USAO found the FBI to be very
inflexible and inextricably attached to the idea of being the
lead agency and exercising total control over any investigative
task in the case. In addition, the prosecutors were critical of
the unwillingness of the FBI to become a "team player." Howen
noted a significant difference between the attitude of members
of the Marshals Service and members of the FBI. He found the
former to be open, flexible and willing to assist with case
preparation in any way that they wee needed while he found the
FBI to be uncooperative and unwilling to volunteer information. 
[FN1535] Similarly, Lindquist characterized the Marshals Service
and BATF as "very open, very cooperative, very accessible" in
contrast to the FBI which he characterized as a "brick wall." 
[FN1536] Ellsworth attributed part of the difficulties between
the USAO and the FBI to the FBI mentality that "the FBI way is
always right." [FN1537] The FBI case agents found the USAO to
be very controlling and unwilling to include them in the case
preparation process. In addition, the FBI criticized the
prosecutors for being to autocratic, abrasive and
confrontational. 

  While preparing the case for trial, there were a number
of incidents that contributed to the negative perception that
each agency had of the other. For example, early in the case,
Lindquist learned that the FBI had issued a directive to the
case agents that they were only to take instructions from
Ellsworth. This directive also required Howen to transmit in
writing to the agents any leads or investigative requests that
he wanted pursued. Apparently this directive was the result of
several incidents including the inclusion of the marshals on the
trial team and the miscommunication concerning the sending of 
leads to Iowa. Lindquist and Ellsworth were very angered by this
directive and contacted the Terrorism and violent Crime Section
of the Department of Justice. Lindquist believed that they
intervened and had the directive revoked. [FN1538] The USAO was
also troubled by the resistance that the FBI showed to the
discovery obligations of the prosecution and to the USAO request
for expert assistance from the FBI Laboratory. [FN1539] 

  From the FBI perspective, they were quite upset with how
the USAO was handling the Weaver prosecution including: the
decision to bring the Marshals Service and BATF into the case,
the USAO opposition to sending leads to conduct the Iowa
interviews, [FN1540] the broad scope of the indictment and the
open discovery policy followed by the USAO. Other issues that
concerned the FBI included the debate over the need to transport
the birthing shed from Ruby Ridge to Boise for use at the trial,
criticism voiced by other team members about the FBI crime scene
search and the USAO treatment of FBI members. [FN1541] 

  The FBI case agents assigned to the Weaver matter
complained that they felt isolated from the activities of the
other team members. For example, Rampton complained that he was
unaware of the projects on which the marshals were working in
part because they were creating no documentation of their
activities. [FN1542] In addition, the FBI case agents believed
that efforts were taken to exclude them from team meetings and
other team activities. 

  Lindquist denied that they intentionally excluded FBI
members from meetings or activities but acknowledged that there
may have been occasions where teams or subteams met without the
other group members. [FN1544] Howen tried to conduct a team
meeting every two or three weeks. He insisted that everyone was
invited and notified of these meetings to discuss matters on
which a particular subteam was working. [FN1545] Both Howen and
Lindquist denied ever instructing the marshals or the BATF
agents to conduct some type of investigative activity and not
inform the FBI about it. [FN1546] Ellsworth suggested that the
reason that the FBI agents felt excluded and believed that the
marshals had a more active role than they did was because the
FBI agents were somewhat physically isolated because they were 
not always in Boise. [FN1547] 

  In addition to the problems that they attributed to the
USAO, the FBI agents also detected hostility and a lack of
cooperation from other team members, most notably the marshals. 
For example, although they made their files available to the
other agencies to assist in case preparation, the FBI case
agents did no feel that the other agencies reciprocated. 1548 
The FBI case agents also recognized that the marshals assigned
to the case were sensitive to any remarks or actions by the FBI
that seemed to question the truthfulness of statements made by
Deputy Marshals Cooper and Roderick. For example, at some
point, Venkus and Rampton discussed the possibility that Degan
may have been moving as he fired his weapon since the spent
cartridges from Degan's gun were spread over 22 feet. This
theory was contrary to the marshals' account that Degan had not
fired his weapon. When Rampton presented this theory, he
recalled Masaitis becoming very upset, stating that he did no
have to listen to this and then leaving the discussion. 
Thereafter, Rampton informed Howen that he was going to send
Degan's gun for an ejection pattern test to determine how far
the spent shells would be ejected. Rampton insisted that Howen
concurred with the plan but later failed to acknowledge his
approval thereby making it look as if Rampton had taken this
action on his own. [FN1549] Several weeks later, Rampton
recalled that Howen met with him and asked if he felt that he
could continue as a team member considering the hostility he had
created by questioning the veracity of Cooper. Rampton insisted
that he was not accusing Cooper of lying but only wanted the
team to focus on a possible conflict between the physical
evidence and Cooper's statement that Degan had not fired his
gun. [FN1550] 

  From the perspective of the marshals, Stafford was
troubled by Rampton's questioning of the truthfulness of the
Cooper and Roderick statements regarding who fired the first
shot. Stafford felt that when Rampton characterized these
statements as being "less than truthful" he was suggesting that
Cooper and Roderick had "purposely" omitted some information. 
[FN1551]  Another incident that angered the marshals concerned the
inaccuracies that appeared in the FBI draft of the Cooper FD-
302. [FN1552] 

  The other team members were aware that the FBI agents
were having difficulty integrating into the team and that
discord existed between them and the FBI agents. For example,
after the first meeting, Stafford perceived that the FBI case
agents were not greatly involved in the case and that they did
not appear to attend very many of the meetings. [FN1553] He
characterized the behavior of the FBI on the case as lacking
initiative and response [FN1554] yet he admitted that he had no
knowledge of the FBI ever refusing to do an investigative task
in this matter. However, he stated that he knew of instances in
which work was assigned to FBI agents but was not completed. 
[FN1555] 

  Another team member, BATF Agent Byerly attributed the
discord between the FBI and other team members to "the
reluctance by the FBI to attempt techniques beyond the norm,"
and the resistance of the FBI to release certain documents and
information to the USAO. [FN1556] Byerly was never aware of any
attempts to exclude a team member from a meeting or to withhold
the existence or the results of an investigative activity from
another team member. [FN1557] According to Byerly, any
disagreements related to issues involving investigative
techniques and proposed approaches to supporting the
government's case such as the proposed reconstruction of the
shooting scene. [FN1558] 

  According to Howen, throughout the case preparation and
trial period, issues continually arose that created discord
between the FBI and the Marshals Service. In his words, the
problem "never got better." [FN1559] Howen took no specific
actions to diffuse the hostility other than to try to listen to 
all sides and allow them equal input into issues. [FN1560] 
Howen also attributed some of the discord between the FBI and
the Marshals Service to an attitude which he believes is
pervasive in the FBI which is that they are the premier
investigative agency and that the other federal agencies are
inferior. There was also a perception among the Marshals
Service members of the team that the FBI had made many errors in
their handling of the crime scene, including the triangulation
issue [FN1561], and that their efforts would have been better if
it had been an FBI agent who had been killed. The discovery of
a document prepared by the FBI that was highly critical of the
Marshals Service actions in the Weaver case further deteriorated
the relationship between the case agents and the FBI. [FN1562] 

  Lindquist attributed the disagreements with the FBI to
the actions and directives of upper management officials and
their failure to communicated with the prosecutors. He believed
that the difficulties that they experienced communicating with
the decision makers in the FBI were due to the command structure
of the FBI and their refusal to communicate with those not at a
comparable rank. [FN1563] To the extent that disagreements
arose between him and the case agents, they were always able to
resolve them except when upper management became involved and
issued orders as to the position to take. [FN1564] Lindquist
said he believed that the FBI case agents were confronted with
the dilemma of wanting to perform their jobs but being required
to adhere to the FBI position on issues such as the lead agency
concept and the sending out of leads. By the early part of
1993, Lindquist thought that the FBI case agents were working
well with the others on preparing the case for trial. [FN1565] 

  (4) Attempts to Interview FBI Officials at Headquarters 

  As part of their case preparations, Howen and Lindquist
wanted to interview FBI officials who were involved in the
deployment and instruction of the Hostage Rescue Team ("HRT")
and in the formulation and modification of the rules of
engagement. Among the individuals that they wanted to interview
were Danny Coulson, Larry Potts and Mike Kahoe. Howen and
Lindquist identified two separate occasions when they
unsuccessfully sought to interview these individuals. The first
occurred in October 1992 when the prosecutors came to Washington
to meet with DOJ officials and the Marshals Service. [FN1566] 
According to Howen, they had provided advance notice to the FBI
that they were going to be in Washington and wanted to interview
these officials. However, when they arrived in Washington and
contacted the FBI, they were informed that the FBI officials
were unavailable. [FN1567] Neither prosecutor made the
interview arrangements. Howen did not know who had set up the
interviews with the FBI but speculated that it was Dillon or
Rampton [FN1568] while Lindquist believed that the Terrorism and
Violent Crime Section at the Department of Justice had made the
arrangements for a specific day. [FN1569] 

  The second time that Howen and Lindquist were
unsuccessful in interviewing the headquarters officials was
sometime in early March 1993. Although Howen could not recall
what, if any, prior arrangements had been made to conduct the
interviews, [FN1570] Lindquist believed that specific times and
been set for these interviews. [FN1571] Lindquist stated that
when they arrived they were told that the FBI officials were
unavailable. It was his impression that they were being "put
off." [FN1572] 

  In a March 17, 1993 memorandum, Dana Biehl mentioned that
the prosecutors expressed a need to interview Potts, Kahoe,
Coulson, Uda and Apple. [FN1573] On the next day, James
Reynolds informed Mark Richard, Deputy Assistant Attorney
General of the Criminal Division, of the need of the prosecutors
to interview these individuals. In addition, Reynolds noted
that when the prosecutors had been in town the previous week,
the FBI had declined to make them available until the Waco
standoff was resolved. Reynolds opined that this position was
unacceptable. [FN1574] He told investigators that his
impression was that Howen and Lindquist had not made advance
appointments with the FBI officials. [FN1575] Mary Incontro
told investigators that when the interview request was made
almost everyone was involved with the WACO crisis. She added
that the FBI always indicated a willingness to meet with the
prosecutors. [FN1576] 

  Thereafter, Reynolds attempted to arrange interviews with
the FBI officials. The FBI agreed to make the officials
available on two or three consecutive days between the hours of
7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. When Reynolds informed Lindquist of this
proposal, Lindquist responded that they had been in Washington
two weeks ago and now the FBI officials could come to Boise. In
a later call, Howen and Lindquist indicated that they would try
to complete the interviews during a one week recess in late
April 1993. [FN1577] Howen said he may have conducted one or
two interviews by phone but that the time demands of the trial
caused him to abandon further telephone interviews. [FN1578]

  3. Discussion 

   a. Decision to Have the Marshals Service and BATF   
Assist in Case Preparation 

  The USAO created great conflict between it and the FBI
when it decided to add the marshals and BATF agents to the trial
preparation team. We find the FBI's actions and attitudes to
have been unjustified and terribly disruptive to the USAO's
trial preparation efforts. Although conflicting evidence exists
as to whether the USAO requested the addition of the marshals to
the trial team or whether the Marshals Service volunteered its
services, we are confident that it was a decision that was
welcomed by both the Marshals Service and the USAO. Perhaps the
USAO could have been more tactful or sensitive in the timing and
manner in which they informed the FBI of this action. However,
we do not consider such a decision to have been one that
required FBI concurrence or approval. We believe that the
decision was appropriate and was certainly one within the
purview of the USAO.   We accept the representations of 
the USAO as to why these agencies were added to 
the trial team, including that they needed additional
assistance in preparing the case for trial. This was a
complicated case that was made dramatically more labor intensive
by the scope of the indictment and the inclusion of the
conspiracy count. Investigative activities needed to be
conducted outside of Boise and large amounts of evidence needed
to be processed, organized and analyzed. We think it was
entirely appropriate for the USAO to turn for assistance to the
Marshals Service and the BATF, both of which had prior
investigative interest and involvement in the case. 

  We are troubled by the reaction of the FBI to the
addition of these new members to the trial team and its
tenacious adherence to its position of being the lead agency. 
Such resistance was unjustified, distracted the USAO from its
task of preparing the case for trial, and set a negative tone
for the working relationship between the FBI and the other team
members. 

 That the FBI had primary jurisdiction over the assault charges
does not confer power on it to control the entire case. There
was room on the case preparation team for the participation of
other agencies having an interest in the case. Once the case
became the responsibility of the USAO we think that they, not
the FBI, were the appropriate governmental body to control the
direction of the case preparation activities. Although a
component of these activities included additional investigation,
we do not find it inappropriate for the USAO to control and
direct such activities. Indeed, it is the USAO that must
present evidence at trial to satisfy all of the elements of the
charged offenses and to meet the defenses raised by the
defendants. Consequently, we believe that the USAO was in the
best position to assess how to prepare the case for trial. 
Having the FBI function as an intermediary between the USAO and
the other agencies would have added a needless and burdensome
bureaucratic layer. We respect the decision of the USAO not to
have instituted such an approach and are extremely critical of
the rigidity of the FBI on this issue. In our view, the FBI
lost sight of its role as assisting rather than controlling the
actions of the USAO. 

   b. The Iowa Interviews and the Failure to Document
the Results 

  We are not aware of any legal principle or statutory
requirement that requires governmental investigators to document
all of the interviews that they conduct. See United States v.
Martino, 648 F.2d 367, 387 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 456 U.S.
943 (1981). Although the FBI requires its agents to document
their interviews, other governmental agencies do not impose
requirements that are as exacting. In this case, the
prosecutors took advantage of the less restrictive documentation
requirements of the Marshal Service and had the marshals conduct
approximately 100 witness interviews during the serving of
subpoenas. [FN1553] It is our opinion that this practice was
imprudent. 

  Under the Brady doctrine the government is required to
disclose to the defense material evidence that is both favorable
to the accused and material to either guilt or punishment. See
United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 676, 682 (1985); Brady v.
Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963). This requirement is not
limited to information that is in written form but extends to
oral statements of which the government is aware. See
generally, Carter v. Rafferty, 826 F.2d 1299 (3d Cir. 1987),
cert. denied, 484 U.S. 101 (1988). In addition, the prosecutor
is responsible for producing Brady information which is within
the knowledge of persons working as part of the prosecution team
of intimately connected with the government's case. United
States v. Butler, 567 F.2d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 1978); United
States v. Morell, 524 F.2d 550, 555 (2d Cir. 1975). Although we
discovered no evidence that these interviews produced any
exculpatory information, our inquiry was severely restricted
since no written, audio or video record was created of these
interviews. Without memorializing these interviews, we were
forced to rely on the memories of two individuals: Howen and
Stafford. 

  Howen insisted that if these interviews had produced any
exculpatory information that he would have notified defense
counsel. No matter how sincere Howen is on the issue, we are
not comfortable that the interview process in place was adequate
to ensure that exculpatory information was identified. No one
ever instructed the marshals or took steps to ensure that they,
particularly Stafford, understood the type of information that
qualified for production under the Brady rule. Moreover, some
of the notations that Stafford made on the subpoena cover sheets
suggest that significant information might have been learned. 
[FN1584] Although this information may not have been Brady
material, we have no reliable means to comfortably conclude that
it is not. 

  Although we recognize that prosecutors may sometimes
participate either directly or indirectly in interviews that are
not documented, we are concerned by the actions of Howen in this
case. Here, we are not talking about one or two undocumented
interviews but rather we are faced with a situation where
approximately 100 interviews were conducted in this manner. 
[FN1585] Although there may be no direct evidence that 
exculpatory information was learned and concealed, we think that
adverse interferences may be drawn by the undocumented interview
process followed in the Weaver prosecution. There were no
reliable safeguards in place to ensure that if exculpatory
information were learned that it would be provided to the
defense. [FN1586] Relying on the memory and judgment,
regardless of how well intentioned, of a marshal who was not
specifically trained or instructed regarding the identification
of exculpatory information, does not suffice. Accordingly, we
find the procedure to be inappropriate and advise against
adopting a similar practice in the future. 

    c. Acoustical Experiment at Ruby Ridge 

  We find nothing improper about the acoustical experiment
that members of the prosecution team conducted in late October
1992 at Ruby Ridge. Indeed, we accept the explanation provided
by Lindquist that it was nothing more than a preliminary attempt
to determine if expert assistance was necessary. The test
firings were not scientifically planned or conducted. Even
Rampton was surprised by the unscientific methodology used. The
test consisted only of the firing of guns at the approximate
locations where the participants of the August 21, 1992 shooting
were located. There were no controls on the experiment or
written findings. Nor, as Howen recognized, was there any way
to duplicate the August 21st conditions since most of the leaves
had fallen from the deciduous trees. 

  The test results were clearly not discoverable under Fed.
R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(D) for two obvious reasons. [FN1587] First,
the test would not qualify as a scientific test or experiment as
that term is commonly understood. The actions that the
participants took in conducting their rudimentary test did not
utilize modern scientific techniques. [FN1588] Second, Rule 16
has been interpreted as requiring only the disclosure of written
reports and written test results. United States v. Peters, 937
F.2d 1422, 1425 (9th Cir. 1991); United States v. Glaze, 643
F.2d 549, 552 (8th Cir. 1981). The government is under no duty
to turn over informal internal documents, but need only disclose
final results and reports. United States v. Iglesias, 881 F2d
1519, 1523-24 (9th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1088
(1990). Here, no written results were ever prepared. 

  Even if the experiment were not discoverable under Rule
16, the issue remains whether the government should have
disclosed it to the defense as Brady material. We find that
such disclosure was not required. From the evidence produced in
our investigation, we found no indication that the test produced
any type of result that could be properly classified as being
exculpatory in nature. No one present for the test could recall
what, if any, conclusions were reached. Lindquist, who was not
present at the test, recalls hearing that the results were
inconclusive as to the effect of echoes and whether the firing
of different types of guns could have been distinguished. Howen
told investigators that he never gave any consideration to
informing the defense of the acoustical test because he did not 
consider what they were doing to be exculpatory. [FN1589] Moreover,
in our view, the unscientific nature of the test coupled with the
difference in conditions caused by the fallen leaves were
significant variables that would call into question any results
obtained. For all of these reasons, we conclude that the test
did not constitute Brady material. 

  d. Attempts to Interview FBI Officials 

  Although we find the difficulty that the prosecutors
encountered in attempting to interview FBI officials in
Washington to be unfortunate, the evidence was inconclusive that
these officials or others in the FBI were intentionally avoiding
being interviewed. Indeed, we are not convinced that explicit
interview arrangements were ever made. No one was able to
provide us with a satisfactory account of who set up the
interviews, what specific arrangements were made, and what
information was provided to the interviewees. Neither Howen nor
Lindquist had a good sense as to who was making the arrangements
to interview the FBI officials. Nor did the clearly recall
having exact times set during which the interviews would occur. 

  Furthermore, none of the FBI officials recalled the first
unsuccessful interview attempt. All denied that they had ever
refused an interview request from the prosecutors. Mary
Incontro indicated that the officials always appeared willing to
meet with the prosecutors. To the extent that these officials
may have been unavailable for interviews during the Waco crisis,
we do not find the excuse to have been a fabrication. These
officials were closely involved in the Waco crisis, were working
long hours and were responsible for monitoring the crisis and
making critical decisions. When James Reynolds contacted them,
they agreed to make themselves available for evening interviews. 
Although perhaps the FBI officials could have shown more
flexibility in accommodating the needs of the prosecutors, we
cannot conclude that their actions were totally without
justification. 

  In the future, we would hope that the FBI will work to
facilitate the access of prosecutors to FBI headquarters
officials who are important to the preparation of federal
prosecutions. A system needs to be instituted whereby the local
FBI office either can make firm arrangements for such interviews
or can introduce the prosecutors to the officials so that direct
arrangements may be made. Although we appreciate the continuous
demands made of many FBI officials, they must recognize that
assisting federal prosecutors in preparing their cases for trial
is included among their responsibilities as a member of the
federal law enforcement team. 

  a. Relationship Among the Investigative Team 

  Prior to the beginning of the Weaver case preparation,
problems existed in the working relationship between the FBI and
the USAO. However, the relationship between these two branches
of the department of Justice dramatically deteriorated with the
Weaver prosecution. Although our investigation did not reveal
that either side was intentionally taking actions to aggravate
the other or to sabotage the prosecution, we were dismayed by
the failure of the parties to more actively try to resolve their
disagreements. 

  Many of the individuals questioned about the relationship
between the USAO in Boise and the FBI attributed the discord to
a personality clash between the parties involved. [FN1590] 
Some, including Stafford, attributed the problem as being
traceable primarily to the FBI Headquarters and the regional
office in Utah. [FN1591] We agree that some of the difficulties
were probably worsened by personality clashes between members of
the USAO and the FBI. However, we believe that the problem goes
much deeper and originated in the bureaucratic rigidity of the
FBI and the institutional bias displayed by some members of that
institution. 

  The behavior of the FBI in the Weaver case revealed their
troubling unwillingness to work as a team player. If the FBI
could not be in control or it its views were not adopted, the
FBI participated in an unreasonable manner by either refusing to
cooperate or going through the motions of cooperating while
exhibiting a negative attitude. Examples of such behavior
included the intransigence that the FBI showed with regard to
its opposition to the case agents conducting the interviews of
the Iowa witnesses, the unwillingness of the FBI to accept and
work with representatives from the other investigatory agencies,
the failure of the FBI to actively assist the USAO by providing
expert assistance, [FN1592] and the resistance of the FBI to
producing materials that the USAO believed were discoverable. 

 [G.J.] 

 [G.J.] 

 The FBI is supposed to work together to assist the prosecutors
in developing and presenting criminal cases for trial. In the
Weaver case the FBI lost sight of this crucial responsibility. 

  When decisions were made by the USAO with which they did
not agree, the FBI found it difficult to accept them and to
proceed with the task of preparing the case for trial. This
problem appeared both to emanate from the managerial levels of
the FBI and to filter down in a diluted form to the case agents. 
We also detected a prevalent and troubling attitude among
members of the FBI that they are the superior investigators and
that all other investigative agencies are inferior. This
attitude was detected by the other agencies which served to
further weaken the already fragile working relationship. 

  Although we sympathize with the pressures under which
members of the USAO were operating in prosecuting this case, we
were left with the impression that perhaps further actions and
discussions might have lessened or resolved the disagreements
between the USAO and the FBI. With regard to the clash between
the FBI and the other investigative agencies, the USAO appeared
to allow matters to proceed without taking any significant steps
to improve the working relationship among these groups. We
suspect that the personalities involved in these disputes
contributed to the standoff that seemed to exist between the
USAO and the FBI. What was needed was a strong personality that
could have risen above the fray and attempted to resolve the
disagreements and misunderstandings that existed. We are
encouraged by the actions and attitude of the new U.S. Attorney
for the District of Idaho and are hopeful and optimistic that
she and the FBI will be successful in eliminating some of the
problems that have plagued the relationship between her office
and the FBI. 

  4. Conclusion 

  The working relationship between the FBI and the USAO and
other team members in the Weaver case was poor and, in our view,
adversely impacted upon the preparation of the Weaver case for
trial. Active steps must be taken to ensure that such problems
do not repeat themselves in subsequent prosecutions.

     1457 Ellsworth stated that: the FBI had primary investigative
jurisdiction as to the two assault on a federal officer counts and
the murder count; the Marshals Service had 
primary investigative jurisdiction as to the three counts of the
indictment charging the failure to appear, harboring a fugitive and
commission of a crime while pending release for trial; the BATF had
primary jurisdiction for the three gun related offenses; and that
all three investigative agencies had responsibility for parts of
the conspiracy count.  Letter from Maurice Ellsworth to Eugene
Glenn, October 23, 1992, at 1-2.

     1458 Initially, Venkus and Rampton informed Howen and
Lindquist that they would be unable to attend the first meeting
because of a conflicting meeting with Dillon.  Venkus FD-302, at

because they were embittered by the decision to bring in the other
agents.  Lindquist Interview, Tape 2, at 15-16; Memo to

marshals would serve their subpoenas. He could not recall why
Deputy  Marshal Cluff, who had the region, did not serve the

 1532 [Garrity] 

 1583 Although Howen and Lindquist may not have issued a
specific directive not to document the interviews, the evidence
demonstrates without question that they did not want to create a
paper trail of their activities for the defense to discover and
that the reason that they did not have the FBI conduct the
interviews was because their agents were required to prepare
written reports of the interviews that they conducted. When
questioned about the failure of the deputy marshals to document
the interviews conducted while serving subpoenas, former
Marshals Service Director Hudson stated that he would not permit
an Assistant U.S. Attorney to direct a deputy marshal not to
write a report in order to avoid discovery requirements. Hudson
FD-302, at 9. 

 1584 For example, on the subpoena sheet for Chris Colegrove,
Stafford deleted the typed words "not needed" and wrote
"needed." Stafford wrote on the subpoena sheet for Steve
Tanner, "This guy must be interviewed. Ron & Kim, Talk to me
about this guy. JWS." 

 1585 U.S. Attorney Ellsworth was unaware that these
interviews had not been documented and had always assumed that
the marshals had agreed to use the FD-302 interview form when 
conducting interviews. He stated that he would have been 
concerned if he had learned that the interviews were not 
being documented since a record needed to be made of
the information collected to ensure that the USAO was complying
with its discovery obligations. In addition, Ellsworth thought
that the conducting of undocumented interviews seemed
inconsistent with the open discovery policy of the USAO. 
Ellsworth saw no problem in documenting all interviews but
stated that there might be some situation when it would not be
necessary. Ellsworth Interview, Tape 4, at 26-28. 

 1586 James Reynolds believed that an interview should be
documented if it generates significant information even if the
amount of information involved is small. Reynolds FD-302,
October 3, 1993, at 6. 

 1587 In the discovery stipulation executed by the parties,
they agreed "to reciprocal disclosure and inspection of all
material stated" in Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1) and 16(b)(1). See
stipulation and Reciprocal Request for Discovery and Inspection,
Notice of Alibi and Notice of Mental Condition, dated October
16, 1992, a 1. Rule 16(a)(1)(D) of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure provides in pertinent part that, 

  Upon request of a defendant the government shall permit
the defendant to inspect and copy or photograph any results or
reports ... of scientific tests or experiments ... which are
within the possession, custody or control of the government, the
existence of which is known, or by the exercise of due diligence
may become known, to the attorney for the government, and which

V. RECOMMENDATIONS

     Law enforcement officials confronted fundamental and recurring
problems of crisis management at Ruby Ridge.  Recently, the
Department of Justice completed an exhaustive review of the
government's response to the crisis at Waco, Texas.  The review
included recommendations for managing barricade/hostage situations,
coordinating law enforcement efforts, and dealing with persons
whose motives and beliefs are unconventional.

     Our recommendations expand on some of the ideas expressed in
the Waco report, and, because each crisis presents its own
particular difficulties, we offer recommendations emanating from
the Ruby Ridge situation.

1.   The Policy for the Use of Deadly Force and the
Authorization Structure for Rules of Engagement
Must be Standardized for All Federal Law
Enforcement Agencies.

We believe that all federal law enforcement officers should be
governed by a standard deadly force policy.  Thus, we recommend
that the Department of Justice establish a universal policy on the
use of deadly force to govern the law enforcement components within
the Department and to serve as a model for other agencies.

We have concluded that the special Rules of Engagement in
force at Ruby Ridge violated the Constitution of the United States. 
We also found that the poorly drafted and ambiguous rules created
confusion among those who were obliged to make instantaneous, life
and death decisions while attempting to obey the requirements of
the rules.  In hostage/barricade situations, law enforcement
officers need a clear definition of the conditions under which
deadly force may be employed.  It is critical that law enforcement
personnel have a common and clear understanding of the rules
governing their conduct.  Moreover, when special rules of
engagement are necessary, established review and authorization
procedures must be in place.

Recently, the Department of Justice established the Office of
Investigative Agency Policy, headed initially by the Director of
the FBI.  We suggest that Office may be best equipped to develop a
standardized policy on the use of deadly force and to formulate
procedures for formulating and authorizing special rules as needed.

2.   Crisis Response Teams Need to be Created

As the authors of the Waco Report observed, it is imperative
that specially trained crisis managers, familiar with relevant
tactical, behavioral, and scientific disciplines, be available to
respond to crises.  FBI special agents in charge of particular
geographical areas are not necessarily the best qualified
individuals to supervise the government's response to crisis
situations.  We recommend that specially trained crisis managers
should be deployed for that purpose.  Expertise, not geography,
should control.  The recent consolidation of the FBI negotiations
and tactical operations, as recommended in the Waco Report, will
have an impact on the role both disciplines play in resolving
crises.

We enthusiastically endorse the recent proposal by the
Terrorism and Violent Crime Section of the Department of Justice
that the FBI Crisis Response Team include specially trained
prosecutors to provide legal support to tactical teams. 
Substantial difficulties confront prosecutors preparing a criminal
case after a violent standoff between suspects and law enforcement. 
Law enforcement agents in such situations need to be mindful that
a successful prosecution is one of the objectives of a favorable
resolution of the crisis.  The presence of prosecutors at crisis
sites can contribute significantly to the ultimate success of the
law enforcement effort within the criminal justice system.

Frequently, as at Ruby Ridge, the local FBI and local SWAT
teams arrive at the scene before the HRT.  Therefore, we propose
periodic joint training exercises by enhanced Crisis Response
Teams, HRT, FBI SWAT teams and other federal and local law
enforcement agencies.  Such cross-training, as discussed in detail
in the Waco Report, would have a number of benefits, including
greater knowledge and appreciation of the contributions of each
element of the response team.

3.   A Multi-Agency Review with DOJ Representation
Should be Established to Review Shooting Incident
Reports

We found that the FBI review of the shooting incident at Ruby
Ridge was not sufficiently thorough or accurate.  We recommend that
all internal reviews of shooting incidents by federal agencies be
scrutinized by a board of representatives of law enforcement
agencies prior to the close of the internal review process.  The
board should include at least one DOJ attorney with special
expertise in this area.

The board could adopt the agency's findings and
recommendations, return the report for additional inquiry, or refer
the report to the appropriate component of the Department of
Justice.  The board would also be responsible for weighing
recommendations made by the agency review team.

Such a process would encourage a higher quality of internal
review throughout federal law enforcement agencies as well as
increase public confidence in the review process.

4.   Coordination Must Be Improved Between the FBI and
Prosecutors in Regard to Discovery

Significant problems in the Ruby Ridge prosecution arose in
the discovery process.  The FBI delayed giving prosecutors the
documents they needed for trial preparation and to provide to the
defense in discovery.  The delayed production of these documents to
the defense occurred, in part, because of disputes between the FBI
and the prosecutors about the material that was required to be
produced.  The delay in the production of the FBI Shooting Incident
Report exemplifies this problem.

We recommend that the Department of Justice mandate that the
FBI release to prosecutors Shooting Incident Reports and supporting
documentation when a confrontation has resulted in death or serious
injury.  Moreover, the FBI should denominate a unit within the
Bureau to coordinate and monitor discovery in a timely and thorough
manner.  Finally, the Department of Justice should establish
guidelines governing the production of FBI material.

5.   Coordination Among the FBI Crime Scene
Investigation Team, the FBI Laboratory, and the
Prosecutors Must Be Improved

Our report is critical of the crime scene investigation at
Ruby Ridge.  Because an experienced evidence response team was not
used to recover and preserve evidence, the quality of the search
and the resulting evidentiary analyses were compromised.  To
increase the chances of a successful prosecution, FBI Headquarters
should mandate that its evidence response team be used in
situations like Ruby Ridge to conduct systematic and thorough crime
scene investigations.

The FBI Laboratory has for years been under conflicting
pressures to perform analyses quickly for many different cases. 
Nonetheless, we believe that the problems that our inquiry has
disclosed could have been avoided.  The FBI Laboratory should not
key its analyses to the trial date.  Prosecutors need laboratory
analyses to develop a theory of their case, and analyses often
suggest that additional examinations should be performed.  We also
recommend that the FBI assign an agent familiar with the theory of
the case, the evidence, anticipated defenses, and FBI forensic
capabilities to coordinate the prosecution's interaction with the
Laboratory.  In complex cases, this role may be exclusive of other
responsibilities.

We also recommend that the FBI reevaluate its policy on
memorializing witness interviews.  We found inaccuracies in FD-302
interview reports of critical trail witnesses, which undermined
their credibility at trial.  The FBI needs to give
consideration to other methods available that would more accurately
memorialize witness interviews.

6.   U.S. Attorneys' Offices Should Establish A Formal
Indictment Review Process

The indictment drafted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen was
reviewed and approved solely by U.S. Attorney Ellsworth.  A number
of defects in the indictment went undetected.  We believe that
significant indictments should be more carefully scrutinized.

We recommend that significant indictments be formally reviewed
by a committee of Assistant U.S. Attorneys within a particular
office, who have been thoroughly briefed on the theory of the case,
the evidence, and anticipated defenses or problems.  We do not
suggest that such a process would resolve every factual or legal
difficulty.  However, it would encourage a more rigorous analysis
of the relevant conduct and would probably ensure more appropriate
charges.

7.   Other Recommendations

We recommend that our analysis of the conduct of Assistant
U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen be referred to the Executive Office for
United States Attorneys for whatever action it deems appropriate.

Finally, we recommend that our findings concerning the events
surrounding the shooting of Vicki Weaver by the FBI sniper/observer
on August 22, 1992 and the Rules of Engagement under which he
operated be referred to the appropriate component of the Department
of Justice for an assessment of its prosecutive merit.
