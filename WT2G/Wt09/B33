<HEAD><TITLE>WINDENERGY</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<BODY><BODY BACKGROUND="leinen3.jpg">
<CENTER><h3>WINDENERGY</h3></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><img src="wind3.jpg"></CENTER><p>

One of the biggest already used regenerative
(renewable) energy sources is the wind. It is expected to 
deliever about 10% of the primary energy demand.  Windenergy 
is produced by windmills, socalled windpower stations.  The 
ideal location for a windpower station is of course the 
coastline, but there are as well enough places in the inland 
that get enough wind.<p>

<ul>Essential is of course a detailed expert opinion on the 
location:<p>


<li>Measurements of the windforce, direction of the wind, speed of 
the wind, 
intensity of turbulences, temperature, atmospheric pressure ect. 
<li>lightning frequence

<li>expert opinion on noise, prognosis on emision
<li>estimation of the expected produced energy per year 
<li>adaption to the power supply system
<li>valid laws and regulations


<p></ul>


This basic work will be carried out by specialised companies,
engeneering offices or by university experts,
who will - in general - look after everything after the order 
has been handed over to them.
<p>

<CENTER><img src="wind4.jpg"></CENTER><p>
Modern windpower stations in windy areas with good wind are already 
working 
economicly effective.  <br>


It should be clear that it is not very sensible to plan a windmill 

in the garden to cover your own electricity needs.  Planning 
sensible 
means to purchase a share in a windpower station, located in an 
area 
with a lot of wind, perhaps in a "windpark" with several units.
These stations do not need any battery to stock the energy but 
supply 
their electricity directly into the public power supply system. 
This way you are building a kind of energy system and can reload 
your 
electric vehicle on any electricity plug. The energy used this way 
is 
leveled out by the energy produced in a windpower station you are 
holding 
a share in. The daily use of energy is regained this way in a 
system that 
is ecological beneficial.<p>

Try calculating the cost for your next car (especially if it is 
your 
second family car) like this:<br> 

Instead of buying a "normal" car for 50.000 marks, you buy an 
eletronic vehicle for approx. 25.000 marks. For the 25.000 left 
over 
you purchase a share in a windpower station..<br>
90% of all distances driven with a car are within the range of a 
modern  
<a href="mobil1e.htm">electric vehicle </a>or a lot closer.
<p>


An interesting variation for the future is the utilisation of 
offshore windpower.
 Offshore windpower is energy produced in windpower stations that 
are located in the 
sea. Presently negotiations are made to lay the legal fundaments 
for the realisation of such plans.<p>
<CENTER><img src="wind5.jpg"></CENTER><p>


To make sure you are investing in the right windpower station it 
is best to get as much information 
material as there are available. Non profit organisations offer 
infos and help.  
<!-- In Deutschland kann an dieser Stelle folgender Verband  als 
erste 
Anlaufstelle gelten:<p>

Deutsche Gesellschaft für Windenergie<br>
Lutherstr. 14<p>
30171 Hannover<p>
Tel.: 0511 282363<br>
Fax.: 0511 282377 -->
<p>



Anybody who is interested in regenerative (renewable) energies 
should think flexible and global.
 Germany takes the second position worldwide with 3000 windpower 
stations after California (17 000)
 but it is important to push the idea worldwide, especially in the 
countries of the third world.
 As an internet surfer you're used to thinking open and global and 
to act in this manner, so - 
don't be afraid of projects in foreign countries.
 The important thing is that "the wind starts blowing". As soon as 
we have the latest 
informations about foreign projects we will publish them here. 
Please keep your patience,
 we' re working on it.<p><hr>

<CENTER><h3>New ecologically beneficial technics - IAA ´95</h3>
</CENTER>

The situation for ecologically beneficial cars is not so good when 
you consider the 
offers made this year. Compared to last year cars with 
alternative technics have 
disappeared again from the stands of the car producers. Some of 
them took them out of 
their product line completely, others have completed their studies 
and are presenting 
examplary models that are ready to go into production. The main 
reason for the caution 
of the manufacturers is the fact that there seems to be no real 
market for such cars, 
they feel there is a lack of interest to buy these automobile.  
But - is that really so?<p>

Most car producers fear the high investment cost for the 
manufacturing plant and the 
risk to face enormous losses if the car - or better the ,mobile" - 
doesn't sell, a risk 
that cannot be taken in times of high unemployment rates.
<p>

And now the positiv things: Irmscher - a company well known for 
Opel car tuning 
is offering a Hybrid version based on the Opel Corsa from spring 
1996 onwards.<p>
<CENTER><img src="selectr1.jpg"></CENTER><p>
<ul>
<li>A mobile for everyday use, aspects like space and safety well 
considered.
<CENTER><img src="selectr2.jpg"><img src="selectr3.jpg"></CENTER>




<li>The small 2-cylinder motor is not constructed to move the car 
but to activate a 
generator that reloads the battery.
<li>This way the mobile drives solely with an electric motor, with 
constant revolution 
and optimated efficiency.
<li>Two electric motors for the single wheel drive at the front 
axle, no shift drive.

<li>No storage battery but modern nickel-cadmium-batteries. Time 
to reload: less than two hours. 

<li>Power assisted braking, side crash protection, protected 
passenger cell and airbag are included. 

<li>Can be deliverd as a van, ideal for all trades and businesses 
(e.g. bakers)that serve 
customers within a certain distance from their workshop.
<p>
<CENTER><img src="selectr5.jpg"></CENTER>

<li>The price should stay under DM 30.000.

<li>Referring to the manufacturer a leasing system for the 
batteries is thinkable. 
The owner of a mobile will drive to a battery station and change 
his empty battery for a reloaded one. 
This way he can always participate in the latest technology. Old 
batteries can be recycled to almost 100%.
We consider this method to be very positiv for the consumer and 
therefor are planning to write a 
more detailed essay concerning this subject in the near future.

<h3><CENTER>The Solar Energy Supply</CENTER></h3><p>
<CENTER><img src="schaf4.jpg"></CENTER><p>

The science differentiates between direct and diffuse sunlight. 
Sunlight is 
designated as "diffuse rays" if it comes through the clouds, fog 
or haze to 
the surface of the earth.
Both kinds of rays can be used for the production of energy, 
whereas the 
proportion can differ very much from location to location. In 
areas with a 
big proportion of direct rays, e.g. the Sahara or California the 
high temperature 
can be used for the generation of current in solarthermoelectric 
units.<p>

In other areas, like Germany, the propotion of diffuse light is 
higher. Only 
systems that are fit for this specification can be used here, to 
focus from 
the all sides incoming light.<p>
<ul>First you differentiate between two possibilities of active 
use of solar energy:<p>

<li><a href="therm1e.htm">Solarthermoelectric Collectors,
</a>, 
the temperature of the sunlight is used here.
<li><a href="pv1e.htm">Photovoltaic Cells, </a>
used for the generation of electric current energy.</ul><p>
<ul>
Third the passive utilisation of sunenergy, an important factor 
for the planning 
of buildings. Next time you' ll find more about that under 
ecological architecture.</ul>

On the average, every German uses twenty times as much energy as a 

man or woman in the third world. If everybody on this planet would 

use as much energy as we do, our earth would collapse in very 
short time.<p>

Fundament of every sensible way of living must be the idea of 
saving energy, 
i.e. we do not have to go without wealth or luxury if and when we 
use, and 
produce energy intelligently and effectivly.<br> 
If we use it effectivly we could even live more comfortable in the 
future and 
at the same time be healthier.

The utilisation of regenerative 
(renewable) energies is based on the reaction 
of 
several components of which each is an important factor in the
"step by step" use of new technologies that are classified to be 
ecologycal beneficial.

Only through the combination of all possible variations a sensible 
use of regenerative (renewable) 
energy will be possible in the long run.</CENTER>

<HEAD><title>Biological Masses, Hydraulic Power and other 
Alternatives </title>

</HEAD>
<BODY><BODY BACKGROUND="leinen3.jpg"><BR>
<h3><CENTER>Biological Masses</CENTER></h3><p>
<CENTER><img src="biom1.jpg"></CENTER>
<p>

Biological mass could cover the total European energy demand until 

2020, 
the areal needed would be a quarter of the actual agricultural 
cultivated land. 
This number corresponds to the estimated area of land inactivated 
until 
then and could be used for the planting of energy plants.
The government bonus would be untouched by this decision. 
Fundamental for a 
sensible utilisation would be the use of different cultures and a 
production 
technique that is adapted to these proceedings. This would be an 
almost inexaustable 
market for the agriculture around the world, especially in the 
countries of the Third World.<p>


Biological mass is an exchange product of stored sun energy. The 
steadily growing of 
biological mass withdraws C02 from the atmosphere while growing 
and gives it off into 
the atmosphere during the process of combustion - once again a 
self contained system.
 Compared to fossile substances this means a reduction of the C02 
emmision.<p>

<table border="5" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
<tr> <td>
<ul>Primary substances are:
<li>Biological mass from land/sea material
<li>Vegitable and animal remainders material
<li>Waste
</ul></td>
 <td>
<ul>Changing process:
<li>Physical
<li>Thermochemical
<li>Biological
</ul></td>
 <td>
<ul>Final Product:
<li>Solid burning
<li>Fluid burning
<li>Gas
<li>Electricity
<li>Heat
</ul></td> 
</tr>
</table><p><hr>

<h3><CENTER>Biological Gas</CENTER></h3><p>
<CENTER><img src="biogas1.jpg"></CENTER><p>


Organic waste, animal or vegitable remainders can be used for the 
production of gas. 
Stored in a so called foul bin, sealed airtight and dark, 
biological gas and 
fertilizer are produced with the help of micro organism.
Normally the so produced gas is then stored in a steel gasometer 
or plastic reservoirs. 
The gas can be used for cooking, room and water heating. The gas 
can work most 
effectively in the so called powerheat-linkage. In power stations 
electric energy 
is produced with a gas motor and a generator, the water is heated 
by the motor cooling system.
<p><hr>

<CENTER><h3>Heating Power Plant</h3></CENTER><p>

<li>Simultaneous ecological beneficial production of electricity 
and heating.


<li>The efficiency of this method is about 90%, natural gas, 
biological produced 
gas or diesel extracted from the rape plant can be used for the 
running of 
the power plant.

<li>Decentralized utilisation, fit for the supply of smaller 
units.

<li>The smallest amount of heat needed is 100-150 kW, this 
corresponds to the heat 
needed for about 30 one family units.

<li>The energy surplus is fed into the public energy system.
<li>A combination with any other regenerative (renewable) energy 
is possible.<p>


Any private person running a heating power plant is only allowed 
to supply 
within a certain area. Ideal for this systems are areas where new 
houses are build 
so that a heating system can be created which connects the 
consumers, individual 
heating systems are no longer needed.
It is necessary to have distribution points between the 
decentralized system 
and the disribution inside the houses (radiators, underfloor 
heating, warm water boiler).
There are no costs for chimney, gasfiring or oil tank.
<p><hr>
<ul><h3><CENTER>Re-growing raw materials</CENTER></h3><p>

<CENTER>
Regrowing raw materials are plants that are not used for food or 
food production 
but for the production of goods or energy.</CENTER><p>
<li><i>Reed, C4 grass.</i><p>
There are more than 1700 different species of C4 grass, 
a variety that couldn't be called a monoculture.
<p>

<ul><i>Utilisation</i><p>

<li>Energy in form of electricity, heat or fuel.
<li>Chemical replacements/substitudes for the production of 
varnish, thinner and plastic.
<li>Biological building- and isolating materials.
<li>Paper and other packing materials.
<li>Eatable or compostable table ware.
<li>Compounds of washing powder and cleaning agents.
<li>Car parts ( biological renewable fibre compound materials)
</ul><p>


<ul><i>Advantages:</i><p>

<li>Less consumption of water
<li>No necessary for plant protective agents.
<li>Regrowing every year, fast growth.
<li>Approx. three times as much biological mass as rape.
</ul><p>

<li><i>Rape</i><p>
Employable as fuel and oil.<p>

<ul>
<li><i>Diesel extracted from the rape plant, RME 
(Rapemethylester).

</i><br>Less soot, sulphur free, biological renewable, practised 
economical cycle, 
positive energy outcome, presently more than 350 petrol stations 
in 
Germany, approx. 80 in Austria.
Considering the ecological conditions, approx. 5% of the German- 
and 10% 
of the European diesel consumption could be replaced.<p>

We would like to talk about our own experiences with bio-diesel 
(diesel 
extracted from rape plants). Since October 1994 (after a 100.000km 
inspection) 
our car, a Citroen BX Turbodiesel, has been refilled with 
bio-diesel only. 
The motor is running well, the smell is much less compared to 
normal diesel, 
the consumption is the same compared to normal diesel, approx. 6.5 
to 7 liters per 100km.
We wanted to find out what happens to the petrol pipes, so we did 
not change them before
 we started the test.
They lasted for about 10 months before they had to be renewed 
because they had swollen
to double their normal size and the texture was brittle. Citroen 
couldn't supply the 
pipes fit for our demand, so we had to renew the pipes again after 
a certain period, 
costing us 1000 marks up til now. Please try to get information 
about this at your car dealers.
<p>


<li><i>Hydraulic oil</i>
<li><i>Lubricants</i>
<p></ul>


<li><i>Straw</i><p>

Referring to scientific studies in Danmark, the burning of the 
agricultural straw 
surplus could cover 7% of the danish energy demand.<p> 

 
<li><i>Wood, wood remainders and scrap</i><p>
</ul>

Hobart liegt an der Flußmündung des Denvent River mit dem 
majestätisch wirkenden Mount Wellington im Hintergrund. Die 
Seefahrerstadt vermittelt einen Eindruck über ihre Entwicklung: 
Koloniale Landhäuser, und große Stadtparks machen Hobart mit Recht 
zur geschichtlich interessantesten Stadt Australiens.<p><hr>

<h3>Langfinger willkommen...</h3><img src="dieb1.gif" align=right>


Für umgerechnet 699,--DM können Gäste des Atrium-Hotels in Darwin/Australien eine Übernachtung buchen und
hernach aus dem Zimmer mitnehmen, was sie wollen: Bett, Matratzen, Tische, Tv, Fön, sogar Teppich und 
Badezimmerarmaturen. Hintergrund dieses kuriosen Sonderangebots, das Hotel soll 
in Kürze komplett renoviert werden.<p><hr>

 

<h3>Für Schlaflose...</h3>
<img src="party1.gif" align=left>

Wer auch früh am Morgen noch nicht ans Schlafen denkt, kann in Madrid neuerdings in sogenannte "After Hours"
 einkehren. Dabei handelt es sich um Disko-Kneipen, die erst um 7 Uhr morgens öffnen. Die ersten Gäste kommen, 
wenn die "normalen" Diskotheken im Morgengrauen ihre Pforten schließen.<p><hr>


<h3>Zimmer zum Recyceln </h3>

Das Hotel- und Gaststättengewerbe steht vor einer kleinen Revolution: Das Scandic Hotel in Stavanger an der norwegischen Südwestküste 
hat die ersten 60 wiederverwertbaren Zimmer. Die von der Scandic-Kette entwickelten Gästedomizile verfügen über Böden 
und Möbel aus nordischen Hölzern. Die Textilien sind aus reiner Wolle oder Baumwolle, die Metallteile 
<img src="dose1.gif" align=right>

wurden auf ein absolutes 
Minimum reduziert. Sparduschen und Toiletten gehörten ohnehin schon zum Standard. Ein Sprecher der Hotelkette: 
"Unsere neuen Zimmer sind zu 97 % recycelbar."<p><hr>


<h3>Rote Karte für Hauspapagei</h3>
<img src="papagei1.gif" align=left>
Das Basil Street Hotel im Lodoner Stadtteil Knightsbridge hat sich von seinem Maskottchen, den Papagei Basil,
getrennt. Der Vogel hatte immer mehr Gäste durch sein reiches Repertoire an Schimpfwörtern geschockt, die ihm
das Personal des Hauses beibrachte. Jetzt sucht das Hotel nach einem neuen Papagei für seinen Parrot Club.
Einstellungsvoraussetzungen: Der Vogel soll nur reden, wenn er angesprochen wird, und z.B. niemals sagen:
"It´s time to go!"<p><hr>

<h3>BRITISH - VIRGIN - ISLANDS</h3>

Die BRITISH - VIRGIN - ISLANDS (BVI) sind ein in Deutschland noch 
fast unbekanntes Reiseziel. Es handelt 
	sich dabei um eine wunderschöne, ursprüngliche Insellandschaft in der nördlichen Karibik. 
	TORTOLA, die Hauptinsel, ist das geschäftliche Zentrum mit mehreren 
	Hotels und Ferienwohnungen. 13000 der insgesamt 16000 Einwohner der Inseln leben hier.<p>
<img src="bvi1.jpg" align=right>
VIRGIN GORDA verfügt über gut entwickelte 
	Ferienanlagen. Auch die anderen Inseln, ungefähr 12 von 50 Inseln sind 
	bewohnt, bieten interessante Möglichkeiten zur Urlaubsgestaltung. Die 
	äußerst geringe Arbeitslosigkeit führt zu einem verhältnismäßig hohem 
	Lebensstandard im Vergleich zu anderen karibischen Inseln und bringt eine 
	soziale Stabilität mit sich, so daß Kriminalität kaum vorhanden ist. Auch setzt 
	das Gouvernement der Kronkolonie auf kontrollierte Entwicklung des 
	Tourismus und damit verbunden, einen besseren Schutz der Natur.<p> 

	Was Sie auf den BRITISH - VIRGIN - ISLANDS nicht finden sind Hochhäuser, Verkehrsampeln, Kasinos und 
	Discos, auch kein Mc Donald` s oder andere Fast-Food-Ketten.<p>
Karibikurlaub vom Feinsten, für Naturliebhaber, Genießer und Entdecker. 





<p><hr>


<h3>Neues bei "USAir"</h3>
<img src="usair1.gif" align=left>

 

	Als Ergänzung zu den bereits bestehenden Flügen nach Pittsburgh, 
	Boston und Philadelphia bietet USAir ab Mai 1996 auch tägliche

<h3>Eiskletterkurse im Sonnental - Urlaubserlebnis für Wagemutige 
</h3> 
<img src="ital1.jpg" align=left>


	Wer im Winterurlaub etwas Außergewöhnliches erleben möchte, der kann in 
	Italien beispielsweise im Trentiner Sonnental das Eisklettern erlernen. Es werden 
	verschiedene Kurse angeboten. Das Wochenprogramm des Sonnentals sieht jeden 
	Mittwoch einen Ausflug zum Eisklettern auf dem Belvedere-Wasserfall vor. Der 
	Treffpunkt ist jeweils um 13.30 Uhr vor dem Verkehrsbüro von Pejo Fonti. Diese 
	Exkursion kostet 50.000 Lire pro Person.<p>

 Für die sportlichen Urlauber gibt es auch an 
	den anderen Wochentagen interessante Unternehmungen im Sonnental, beispielsweise 
	Skilaufen außerhalb der Piste am Freitag und Samstag oder eine Lektion im Free-
Climbing am Freitag nachmittag. <p>
Am Donnerstag können die Gäste an einer alpinen 
	Skitour durch das Val di Strino teilnehmen und am Dienstag bietet sich die Möglichkeit 
	am Nachmittag einmal das Schneeschuhlaufen am Lago delle Malghette 
	auszusprobieren.<p> 

	Diejenigen, die es auf die zugefrorenen Wasserfälle in einer fast unberührten 
	verschneiten Landschaft zieht, können ebenfalls einen dreitägigen Eiskletterkurs von 
	Freitag 8.00 Uhr bis Sonntag 17.00 Uhr buchen. Vom Erlernen der Sicherheitstechnik 
	bis zum eigenhändigen Erklimmen eines Wasserfalls reicht das Spektrum eines Kurses. 
	Dieses atemberaubende Vergnügen kostet bei vier TeilnehmerInnen 
pro Person 260.000 Lire. 
	Die Ausrüstung wird von den Organisatoren kostenlos zur Verfügung gestellt.<p><hr>

For this model you have to use a wood that is full of resin - larch, 
delivered to you ready cut,  in the right mesures and sizes. Especially 
fit for use are trunks that are cut in winter for they have highest 
stability and through the frost period a high resistance to destructive 
insects. Stored for at least a year the heartwood gets a max stability 
through the segmentation.<BR>

Segmentation: the heartwood is cut in two halfs, glued opposite against the cutting edge. Using this method you will get an almost warp- and stressfree beam.<P>

<h3>Die Lisboa Card - der preiswerte Weg, Lissabon kennenzulernen</h3>

 
	Seit Herbst diesen Jahres gibt es für die Besucher Lissabons einen einfachen und 
	preiswerten Weg, die Hauptstadt Portugals kennenzulernen: Die Lisboa Card. Sie 
	berechtigt zur uneingeschränkten Benutzung aller öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel, 
	zum freien Eintritt von 26 Museen und historischen Denkmälern und zu einem 10 
	bis 50%-igen Preisnachlaß bei anderen touristischen Attraktionen. Jeder erwachsene 
Inhaber einer Lisboa Card kann darüber hinaus bis zu zwei Kinder unter fünf 
	Jahren kostenlos mitnehmen. Die Lisboa Card kostet für 24 Stunden 1200 
	Escudos (circa DM 12), für 48 Stunden 2000 Escudos und für 72 Stunden 4600 
	Escudos. Die Karte kann täglich zwischen 9.00 und 17.00 Uhr am Posto Central 
	do "Lisboa Card", Rua Jardim do Regedor, no. 50, Tel.: (1) 343 36 72/3 erworben 
	werden. Der Inhaber erhält zusätzlich eine Broschüre mit Kartenmaterial, die 
	ausführlich über alle Leistungen der Karte informiert.

<h3>Indien - Für Assam, Meghalaya und Tripura keine Genehmigung mehr erforderlich</h3>
<img src="indien1.jpg" align=left>
 
	 
	Die drei Bundesstaaten, im äußersten Nordosten Indiens gelegen, können seit kurzer Zeit von 
	Einzel- wie auch Gruppenreisenden ohne die bislang erforderliche Genehmigung besucht 
	werden. Herrliche, unberührte Landschaften, ethnische Vielfalt und eine einmalige Flora und 
	Fauna zeichnen den Nordosten Indiens aus.<p> 

	Assam, am Fuße des Himalayas gelegen und von dem mächtigen Brahmaputra durchzogen, 
	ist der bekannteste der drei Staaten  neben den berühmten Teeplantagen sind die 
Nationalparks Kaziranga, Manas und das Vogelreservat Sibsagar die Attraktionen für die Besucher. Im 
	historischen Sibsagar befindet sich der größte Shiva-Tempel Indiens und die Ruinen des Palastes 
	der Herrscher von Ahom. Assams Hauptstadt Guwahati ist das Tor zu den südlicheren 
	Bundesstaaten Meghalaya und Tripura. <p>

	Meghalaya, "Wohnsitz der Wolken", ist geprägt von sanften, grünen Hügeln und rauschenden 
	Wasserfällen. Die Hauptstadt Shillong wurde vom Gesandten des damaligen britischen 
Generalgouverneurs geplant und wegen der Atmosphäre und dem angenehmen Klima nannten die 
	Briten Meghalaya "Schottland des Ostens". <p>

	In Agartala, Haupstadt des kleinen Tripura, zeugen elegante Paläste von der 1300 Jahre 
	währenden Herrschaft der Maharajas  sie förderten Wissenschaft, Kultur und Handwerk, und 
	die Traditionen der Bildhauerei, Holzschnitzkunst, Metallbearbeitung und der Webkunst, für 
	die Tripura berühmt ist, haben bis heute überdauert. <p>

	Es gibt Flugverbindungen von New Delhi nach Guwahati (tägl.) und von Calcutta nach 
	Guwahati, Shillong oder Agartala.

<h3>Jerusalem - Dinieren wie König David</h3><img src="israel1.gif" align=right>


 


	Zum "King David Feast", einem einzigartigen, von 15 internationalen Spitzenköchen zubereiteten Bankett, lädt 
	Jerusalem im Rahmen seiner 3000-Jahrfeier im kommen- 
	den Jahr ein. Rund 500 Gäste werden bei dem zwölfgängigen Festessen am 18. März 1996 im Binjanei Ha'Ouma 
	wie zu König Davids Zeiten dinieren. <p>

	Zum Team der Spitzenköche gehören unter anderem internationale Größen der Kochwelt wie beispielsweise Paul 
	Prudhommes aus den USA, Paul Haberlin aus Frankreich 
	und Vincent Bossotto aus der Schweiz. Die Köche lassen 
	sich bei der Kreation der verschiedenen Gerichte, die alle 
	koscher zubereitet sind, von der Bibel inspirieren. Artisti- 
	sche Darbietungen unterhalten die Gäste während des 
	fünfstündigen Banketts. Eigens für dieses kulinarische 
	Ereignis entworfenes Geschirr sorgt für eine Atmosphäre 
	wie am Hofe des legendären Königs.

<h3>Indonesien - So verhalten Sie sich richtig</h3>

 

	Händeschütteln zur Begrüßung ist in 
	Indonesien üblich, aber geben Sie niemals 
	Ihre linke Hand. Vermeiden Sie auch, 
	etwas mit der linken Hand zu geben 
	oder zu nehmen. Die Benutzung des 
	Zeigefingers, um auf jemanden zu 
	deuten oder um jemanden herbei- 
	zuwinken, gilt als unhöflich. Mehr 
	über lokale Sitten und Tabus zu 
	wissen, ist auch in Indonesien sinnvoll und vermeidet Mißverständnisse.

<center><h3>Nationalparks und Wildreservate:</h3></center>



Die Schönheit der Natur Australiens

können Sie in über 2000 Nationalparks

und Wildreservaten und 10 World

Heritage-Stätten sehen: Great Barrier

Reef, Muru (Ayers Rock), Regenwälder

von Queensland, Fraser Island und die

verlassene Täler von Südwesttasmanien.

Beim Besuch eines Nationalparks oder

einer World Heritage-Stätte können Sie

im Visitor Centre sowohl Karte und

Broschüre erhalten, als auch Dia- und

Filmvorführungen sehen.  Während der

Haupturlaubszeit finden Führungen statt.<p>



Australien hat im Hinblick auf Nationalparks eine lange 
Tradition, es erklärte 1879 als erstes Land der Welt 
einen Park in Sydney zum "Nationalpark" - den Royal 
National Park.  Alle Bundesstaaten besitzen
Nationalparks und World Heritage-Stätten, die Sie 
entdecken und erkunden können.  Viele davon liegen nicht 
weit von Groß- und Kleinstädten entfernt.  Fragen Sie bei 

den State Parks und Wildlife and Conservation Authorities 

nach Auflistungen und Informationen über die 
Einrichtungen und die angebotenen Freizeitaktivitäten.<p>

Within our environement the forest has important functions: he is living 
space for plants and animals as well as recreation space for the human being. 
The forest protects the ground from erosion and stores water. Modern forestry 
has made it possible to use the forest in such an economically sensful way that 
a natural circulation is formed. There are only as many trees cut down as there 
are trees growing in the same period of time. If you are using wood today, you 
are using a raw material usable in multiple ways. A raw material that is easy 
to supply, easy to manufacture and easy to get rid of.<P>


Wood is of ecological and economical importance. It is one of the few 
materials that are disposable for the human beeing as long as he cultivates 
the forest in a sensible way. 
<P><HR><P>

<CENTER>Wood is esthetical, natural, full of life, of a high value but still not expensive.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Using wood is conservation.</FONT><BR> 
Building a blockhouse wood is used the most natural way. That is why wood is of such high 
value to people who care for their health and the environement.

<li>Flatten the pondwalls, remove all sharp stones and rests of roots.
<li>Spred a layer of sand in the dug out pit, about 5-10cm high. If possible use an additional fleece.

<li>Do not forget to plan all other special things, like artificial runs, nature 
filters or cascades from the very beginning! Think of all watercirculations under 
the ground, like runs or cascades, as well as about several electric connections 
for the pumps and the spotlights that you are placing around the pond.

<HEAD><TITLE>Garden Pond</TITLE></HEAD>

<BODY><BODY BACKGROUND="leinen3.jpg">
<CENTER><img src="teich1.jpg"></CENTER><P>

Everybody who likes the idea of having a garden pond should know that he is going to spend a lot of time,
work and money. But on the other hand you are surely regaining a piece of nature to give you peace and relaxation and at the same time creating living space for countless animals. The most important point here is the thoughtful planning that has to be completed before the actual work starts.
<p>
The following advices are based on own experiences worked out the building of our own foil pond.
No guide can give you a 100 % guarantee for the success because that is very dependent on the 
position of the pond.

<p>
<ul><h3>Position:</h3>
<li>Shadow at midday, sun for the rest of the day, at least 6 hours.
<li>Protection on the "weather-side", the climat is very important for the insects and plants that grow and breed on,
in or near the pond.
<li>No trees close to the water. The quality of the water is endangered especially in autumn when leafs and needles
are falling down from the trees and the water quality is most important for plants and animals.
<li>Something worth thinking about is a fresh water supply, e.g. a well or a run.
<li>Please also consider playing children and keep the pondside as flat as possible - about 50 cm wide, put a fence
around the ground an inform your liability insurance and make all possible steps to protect any living species
that meight come near your ground.</ul>
<ul><h3>Let`s start!</h3>

<li>Mark the planned outlines of the pond with chalk or white sand.
<li>The bigger the pond is the more stable are the life conditions for plants and animals and the water quality.
That way you can reduce
the cost for the maintanance of your pond immensly.
<li>Forget the idea of trying to build it yourself with a spade, you will need an exavator.
In its deepest zones the pond should have a depth of about one meter to guarantee survival for the animals that
live in the water during the winter season.
<li>Split your pond into flatwater or swampzones, middle-deep zones and deepwater zones.
<li>Test with a qualified pair of scales if the pondside is on the level.
<li>If you start building in late summer, the pond will be filled with rainwater in autumn and winter.

<img src="barbad2.jpg" align=left>

	Miles and miles of beaches welcome the visitor in hue 
	ranging from delicate pink to purest white. Together with 
	the spectacular blue sea and the steady trade winds they 
	make Barbados a place that is unparalleled for relaxation. 
	Sports activities range from diving to sailing and surfing,
tennis, golf or riding, just to name a few.<p><pre> </pre><p><pre> </pre><p>
<img src="barbad3.jpg" align=right>
	Being the most easterly of  the Caribbean islands, Barbados has a distinctive 
	character: a pleasant mixture of typical British and sunny-Caribbbean influences. 
	First-time visitors to Barbados will be pleasently surprised by the friendliness of the 
Bajans.<p><pre> </pre>

	<h3>Bridgetown:</h3>The capital was founded by the British 
	settlers in 1628. Trafalgar Square, a miniature version of 
	the famous London square including a statue of Admiral 
	Nelson is centrally located. The Queens Park and the

	<h3>Diving: </h3>The breath-taking underwater 
	world with its coral reefs and 
	colourful fish is a real paradise for 
	divers. <p>

	<h3>Drinking Water: </h3>Barbados´ water is 
	pure and safe to drink. It is filtered 
	through local limestone base and pumped 
	to the tap with a minimum of chemical 
	treatment. <p>

	<h3>Entertainment: </h3>Barbados offers a 
	spectacular nightlife with dance shows, 
	night clubs and discos. Especially on the weekend various hotels arrange evenings with 
	fire eaters, limbo dancers and steel bands. <p>

	<h3>Festivals: </h3>The Holetown Festival starts in February with the anniversary of the arrival 
	of the first settlers. Easter weekend brings accolades to the local people who compete in 
	the two-day Oistins Fish Festival. The completion of the sugar cane harvest is being 
	celebrated with music, dance and native culture at the Crop Over Festival. The National 
	Independence Festival of Creative Arts is being celebrated in November. <p>

	<h3>Food and Drink: </h3>There´s a good selection of restaurants with international and local 
	cuisine. The island´s speciality is Flying Fish. Rum, the national drink of the island is 
	being mixed and served with different ingredients. <p>
<img src="barbad6.jpg" align=left>
	<h3>Geography: </h3>Barbados is the most easterly island of 
	the archipelago of the Caribbean islands. The calm 
	Caribbean Sea on the sheltered west coast contrasts 
	dramatically with the towering, crashing waves of the 
	Atlantic Ocean on the north and east coast. <p>

	<h3>Government: </h3>Barbados is an independent member of the 
	British Commonwealth. The Queen of Great Britain is 
	also the Queen of Barbados and is represented by the 
	Governor General. <p>

	<h3>Harrisons Cave:</h3>Series of beautiful underground 
	caverns with crystalline stalagtites and stalagmites, 
	two streams, pools and a waterfall. <p>

	<h3>History:</h3>The first inhabitants of Barbados were the 
	Arawaks and Caribs. In 1536 a group of Portuguese 
	sailors landed on the island while on their way to 
	Brazil. They called the island "Los Barbados" after 
	the ficus trees whose aerial roots look like beards. 
	Barbados became independent in 1966. <p>

	<h3>Landscape:</h3> The pear-shaped island has a total area of 
	430 km² and is 30 km long and 20 km wide at its widest 
	point. The island is usually described as a flat land 
	but in fact the land rises from west to east in a 
	series of gentle terraces to the highest point, Mount 
	Hillaby in St. Thomas at 350 m.<p>

	<h3>Markets: </h3>A variety of fresh fruit and vegetable is being offered at the markets which are 
	an ideal spot to get into contact with Bajans. Visit the markets in Bridgetown (Cheapside 
	and Fairchild Street) or the fish market in Oistins. <p>

	<h3>Party Cruises: </h3>The Bajan Queen and the Jolly Roger provide four hour cruises with 
	partying to life bands, an open bar and Barbeque Buffet dining or for simply relaxing. 
	Enjoy the elegant ambience aboard the "Harbour Master" with its own submarine, restaurant, 
	theater, nightclub, function area and one of the largest bars in Barbados.<p>

	plantation "great houses" of former plantation owners are open to the public. Examples are 
	St. Nicholas Abbey, St. Peter and Villa Nova in St. John.<p> 

	<h3>Population: </h3>Barbados is home for approx. 263.000 inhabitants, called Bajans. They are 
	well-known for their friendliness, helpfulness and happiness.<p> 
<img src="barbad7.jpg" align=left>

	<h3>Taxis: </h3>There are taxis on the airport, beach resorts and most of the hotels. The fares 
	are generally fixed, however, the taxis are not equipped with a
	taximeter. It is therefore 
	advisable to negotiate about 
	the fare in advance if going on 
	an island tour by taxi.<p> 
<img src="barbad9.jpg" align=right>
	<h3>Watersports: </h3>Available 
	watersports are windsurfing, 
	catamaran sailing, water-skiing

	Hall Gully. The Oughterson National Wildlife Park with its monkeys, tropical birds, 
	crocodiles, snakes and tortoises is a nature experience for everyone.<p>

<CENTER><h2>AUSTRALIEN</h2><p>
<img src="koala1.jpg"><p>
</CENTER>
Australien ist ein gewaltiger Kontinent, der sich vom 
Indischen 
Ozean bis zum Pazifik erstreckt.
Es ist der kleinste Kontinent und zugleich die größte 
Insel der 
Welt mit starken Gegensätzen. Moderne Städte zeigen
sich an Flüssen oder Häfen von ihrer schönsten Seite. Im 
Herzen 
des Landes folgen die Aborigines dem Lebensstil
ihrer Vorväter.<p>
<CENTER><img src="rock1.jpg"><p></CENTER>
Cattle Stations sind Landstriche, die Hunderte von 
Kilometern lang 



sind. Besucher erleben hier das unverfälschte
Leben im Outback: Viehantrieb, Schafscheren, Känguruhs 
und Grillen 



im Freien.<p>
<CENTER><img src="lafeu1.jpg"><p></CENTER>
Bei einem Glas Bier im Country-Pub hören sie den 
Geschichten aus 
dem Leben abseits vom Streß der Großstadt zu.<p>

Unternehmen Sie eine Buschtour mit einem 
Aborigine-Führer.Besuchen 



Sie den mystischen, roten Felsen in der Wüste
oder gehen Sie in Malls oder Einkaufspassagen 
australischer 
Großstädte Shopping.<p>
<CENTER><img src="abo1.jpg"><p></CENTER>
Die Urlaubsinseln laden zum Sonnenbaden oder zum 
Schnorcheln im 
Korallenriff ein. Unternehmen Sie Wanderungen
durch den prähistorischen Urwald, machen Sie Weinproben, 
eine 
Hafenrundfahrt mit einem Segelboot oder seilen Sie
sich von einem im Dunst liegenden Berg ab. <p>
Australien bietet für jeden etwas. Eine einzigartige 
Lebensart, 
keine Luftverschmutzung und saubere
Bäche, die den Regenwald durchziehen. Jede Menge 
Abwechslung, wer 
hier mal war, hat wirklich was zu erzählen.

ausgeschenkt. 


 Sonntags je nach Staat verschieden.  Restaurants, Klubs 
und 
Hotelbars haben flexiblere Öffnungszeiten.  Ab 18 Jahren 
dürfen 
Jugendliche Alkohol kaufen und in der Öffentlichkeit 
trinken.<p>

<h3>Behindertengerechte Einrichtungen</h3>

In Australien ist man sehr auf behindertengerechte 
Einrichtungen 
bedacht.  Bei frühzeitiger Anmeldung mit Angabe der Art 
der 
Behinderung können Sie sich darauf verlassen, daß sich 
die 
Fluggesellschaften, Hotels und
Reisebüros so gut wie möglich darauf einstellen.  
Entgegenkommen 
findet man auch in vielen Kinos und Restaurants.  Die 
Neubauten 
haben Rollstuhlrampen.  Weitere Informationen erhalten 
Sie von:<p> 


National Information Communication Awareness Network 
(NICAN)<br> 
P0 Box 407 Curtin, 2605<p>

Tel: (06) 285 3713 <br>Fax: (06) 285 3717<p>

<h3>Benzin</h3>

Verbleites und bleifreies Benzin werden an dem gut 
ausgebauten 
Tankstellennetz zum

Literpreis von $A 0,65 - 0,75 abgegeben.  Die 
Öffnungszeiten 
variieren, und viele Tankstellen nehmen internationale 
Kreditkarten an.<p>

<h3>Führerschein</h3>

Ein Besucher darf in Australien Fahrzeuge mit einem 
gültigen ausländischen
Führerschein derselben Fahrzeugklasse
fahren.  Führerschein und Reisepaß müssen beim Autofahren 

mitgeführt werden.  Der internationale Führerschein 
allein ist 
nicht ausreichend, er muß mit dem gültigen Führerschein 
mitgeführt 


werden.<p>

<h3>Geldumtausch/Reiseschecks</h3>

Ausländische Währung kann in allen internationalen 
Flughäfen 
umgetauscht werden.  Geldumtausch oder Einlösung von 
Reiseschecks 
ist in Banken oder großen Hotels möglich.<p>

Banken:	Mo-Do 9.30-16.00 Uhr, Fr 9.30-17.00 Uhr.<p>

Postämter: Mo-Fr 9.00-17.00 Uhr.<p>

<h3>Impfungen</h3>

Es sind keine Impfungen nötig, vorausgesetzt,

Sie haben sich innerhalb der 6 Tage vor Ihrer

Ankunft in Australien nicht in einem

Gelbfiebergebiet aufgehalten.<p>

<h3>Kleidung</h3>
In den tropischen Gebieten trägt man das ganze Jahr 
hindurch 
leichte Kleidung (Naturfaser).  In den südlichen, 
gemäßigten 
Klimaregionen benötigen Sie abends eine Jacke oder einen 
Pullover, 


denn die Nächte sind manchmal kühl.  Für die Wintermonate 
sind im 
Süden Pullover und wärmere Kleidung 


zu empfehlen.  Wenn Sie am Barrier Reef Fische beobachten 
möchten, 


bringen Sie als Fußbekleidung leichte Turnschuhe mit.<p>


<h3>Kreditkarten</h3>

American Express, Bankcard, Carte Blanche, Diners Club, 
MasterCard, Visa und ihre Tochtergesellschaften.  Fragen 
Sie Ihre 
Bank vor der Abfahrt.<p>

<h3>Maße und Gewichte</h3>

Die Ihnen bekannten Maßeinheiten, wie km, km/h, kg, 1, °C 
werden 
benutzt.<p>

<h3>Medizinische Versorgung</h3>

Verschreibungspflichtige Medikamente

dürfen mitgeführt werden.  Wenn größere Mengen benötigt 
werden, 
sollte man am Zoll ein Attest vorlegen.  Einige Rezepte 
müssen 
jedoch von einem in Australien zugelassenen Arzt neu 
ausgestellt 
werden.<p>

Staatsangehörige aus Finnland,

Großbritannien, Italien, Malta,

Neuseeland, den Niederlanden und
Schweden können Medicare, den australischen staatlichen 
Gesundheitsdienst, in Anspruch nehmen.  Schließen Sie 
eine private 


Krankenversicherung ab.

<h3>Notfall</h3>

Wählen Sie im Notfall 000, um Krankenwagen, Feuerwehr und 
Polizei 
zu alamieren.<p>

<h3>Per Anhalter/Hitchhiking</h3>

In einigen Staaten Australiens nicht erlaubt.  Es wird 
dringend 
davon abgeraten.  Mögliche Gefahren muß man gegen den 
preislich 
reduzierten Buspaß abwägen.<p>

<h3>Shopping</h3>

Es gibt Kaufhäuser, Einkaufspassagen, Andenkenläden, 
Boutiquen und 


Fachgeschäfte.  Erwerben Sie Opale oder Halbedelsteine, 
Schaffell- 


und Lederwaren sowie Kunstgegenstände.  Geschäfte zum 
zollfreien 
Einkauf gibt es in Stadtzentren und internationalen 
Flughäfen.<p>

<h3>Sonnenschutz</h3>

Tragen Sie einen Hut mit breiter Krempe, ein 
langärmeliges Hemd 
und benutzen Sie für ungeschützte
Körperteile Sonnencreme mit
Schutzfaktor 15 und darüber.  Vermeiden
Sie die Sonne zwischen 11.00-15.00

Uhr, da die UV-Strahlung dann am stärksten ist.<p>

<h3>Sprachunterricht</h3>

Australische Colleges und Universitäten sind weltweit 
anerkannt 
und nehmen eine bedeutende Stellung ein.  Warum Englisch 
in 
Australien lernen?  Neben den niedrigen 
Lebenshaltungskosten sind 
weitere Pluspunkte: gutes Wetter, Sehenswürdigkeiten, 
freundliche 
Atmosphäre, Sprachschulen mit ganzjährigem 
Unterrichtsprogramm.<p>

<h3>Sicherheit am Strand</h3>

Die freiwilligen Lebensretter der Surf Life Saving 
Association 
patrouillieren populäre Strände.  Schwimmen Sie immer 
zwischen den 


Flaggen.  Die meisten Strände werden patrouilliert.<p>

<h3>Telefonieren</h3>

Die Grundgebühr für ein Ortsgespräch beträgt 40 Cents.  
Orts-, 
Fern- und Auslandsgespräche können von öffentlichen 
Münzfernsprechern gemacht werden.  Gebühren entnehmen Sie 
dem
Telefonbuch oder fragen Sie bei der Vermittlung.  Die 
australische 


Telefonkarte (Phonecard) wird in vielen Geschäften 
verkauft und 
kann in 75% der Telefonzellen benutzt werden.  
Kreditkartentelefone (Creditphones), finden Sie in 
Flughäfen, 
Stadtzentren und Hotels.<p>

<h3>Unterwegs</h3>

In Australien herrscht Linksverkehr und Anschnallpflicht. 
 Taxis 
gibt es in

Städten.  Qantas, Ansett Australia und deren 
Tochtergesellschaften 


bieten einen Pass, der vor der Ankunft zu kaufen ist.  
Bahn und 
Bus: Moderne Dienste verbinden Städte und wichtige 
Zentren.<p>

<h3>Visum</h3>

Besucher, ausgenommen Reisende mit australischem oder 
neuseeländischem Reisepaß, müssen vor der Einreise ein 
Visum 
beantragen.  Siehe Visa-Information.<p>

<h3>Verschiedenes</h3><ul>

<li>Die Stromspannung beträgt 240/250 Volt, Wechselstrom 
50 Hz.  
Die 
Steckdosen haben drei Einsteckstellen, deshalb benötigen 
Sie einen 


Adapter.  In Hotels gibt es gewöhnlich Universalstecker 
für 240 
V-Rasierapparate.

<li>Es wird kein zusätzliches Bedienungsgeld in Hotels 
und 
Restaurants 
berechnet.  Trinkgelder liegen stets in Ihrem Ermessen.

<li>Das Rauchen ist in öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln, auf 
Inlandsflügen, in zahlreichen öffentlichen Gebäuden und 
einigen 
Restaurants untersagt.

<li>In North Queensland müssen Sie zwischen Ende Oktober 
und 
Anfang 
Mai auf Quallen aufpassen, die an der Küste angeschwemmt 
werden.  
Davon betroffene Strände haben meistens Hinweisschilder.  
Populäre 


Strände haben sichere Schwimmbereiche im Ozean.</ul><p>


<h3>Wetter</h3>

Im Norden herrscht tropisches Klima, das etwa 40% der 
australischen Landmasse beeinflußt; die restlichen 
Gebiete liegen 
in einer gemäßigten Klimaregion.  Dennoch gibt es 
Variationen 
innerhalb dieser Klimazonen.<p>
Frühling:            September-November<p>
Sommer:	Dezember-Februar<p>
Herbst:              März-Mai<p>
Winter:              Juni-August<p>

<h3>Zeitzonen</h3>

Australien hat drei Zeitzonen:
<ul><li>Eastern

Standard Time (EST) in NSW, ACT,

VIC, TAS und QLD; <li>Central Standard

Time (CST) in SA und NT; <li>sowie

Western Standard Time (WST) in WA.</ul><p>

Die Zeitverschiebung ist wie folgt: <ul><li>EST

= 12.00 Uhr,<li>CST = 11.30 Uhr,<li>WST =
10.00	Uhr.</ul><p>  Außer in QLD, NT und

WA, gilt die Sommerzeit von Oktober/November bis März.  
Die Uhren 
werden dann um 1 Stunde vorgestellt.<p>


<h3>Zoll</h3>

Strenge Gesetze verbieten die Einfuhr von Drogen, 
geschützten 
Tieren und Pflanzen sowie daraus hergestellten Artikeln.  
Es gibt 
keine Einfuhrbeschränkungen bezüglich Ihrer Reisekasse.  
Beträge 
über $A 5000 in australischer oder anderer Währung sind 
allerdings 


bei der Ein-und Ausreise meldepflichtig.<p>

Besucher ab 18 Jahren dürfen 1l Alkohol, 250 Zigaretten 
oder 250 g

<h3>Autofahren und Mietwagen</h3>

Australiens Straßennetz ist gut ausgebaut.  Die großen 
Fernstraßen 


und Städteverbindungen sind in gutem Zustand. Jedoch gibt 
es 
einige ungeteerte Straßen, die den Erlebnishungrigen auf 
staubiger 


Piste ins Outback führen.<p>


<h3>Straßenkarten/Verkehrsinformationen
</h3>
Ausführliche Verkehrsinformationen und Straßenkarten 
erhalten Sie 
bei den Automobilclubs des jeweiligen Bundesstaates.  
Mietwagen 
sind generell mit Straßenkarten ausgestattet.<p>



<h3>Touristeninformationen</h3>

Selbst in den kleinsten Orten werden Sie eine 
Touristeninformation 


mit umfangreichem Material finden.  Halten Sie Ausschau 
nach dem 
"I" 
= Information.<p>


<h3>Straßenverkehrsordnung</h3>

In Australien herrscht Linksverkehr.

Höchstgeschwindigkeit in den Städten

60 km/h; auf Land- und Fernstraßen

100 km/h, außer bei abweichenden

Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzungen.

Anschallpflicht besteht für Fahrer und

Beifahrer.  Der erlaubte Alkoholgehalt

beträgt 0,5 Promille, nur im Northern

Territory 0,8 Promille; strichprobenartige

Kontrollen gibt es in den meisten

Bundesstaaten.<p>

<h3>Führerschein</h3>
Ein Besucher darf in Australien mit einem gültigen 
ausländischen 
Führerschein derselben Fahrzeugklasse 
fahren.  Führerschein und Reisepaß müssen beim Autofahren 

mitgeführt werden.  Der internationale Führerschein 
allein ist 
nicht ausreichend, er muß mit dem gültigen Führerschein 
mitgeführt 


werden.<p>


<h3>Benzin</h3>

Verbleites und bleifreies Benzin kostet ca. $A 0,70 pro 
Liter.  
Auf dem Land ist Benzin teurer.  Es gibt ein gutes 
Tankstellennetz; die Öffnungszeiten sind unterschiedlich. 
 
Kreditkarten werden in der Regel angenommen.<p>

<h3>Behinderte Fahrer</h3>

Behindertengerechte Fahrzeuge sind nicht immer vorhanden. 
 Fahrern 


wird empfohlen, die eigene Handschaltung mitzubringen und 
in 
Australien im

Mietwagen anbringen zu lassen.  Weitere
Informationen erteilt "Paraplegic and
Quadriplegic Association" des betreffenden
Bundesstaates, mit der Sie sich vor der
Abreise in Verbindung setzen sollten.<p>

<h3>Pannenhilfe</h3>
Bei Problemen mit dem Mietwagen benachrichtigen Sie den 
Autovermieter.  Er wird einen Pannenwagen organisieren.  
An den 
Tankstellen kann Ihnen ebenfalls geholfen werden.  Mit 
Ihrem 
Automobilclub eventuell kostenlose Leistungen im Ausland 
abklären.
<p>

<h3>Fahren im Outback</h3>
Fahren Sie vorsichtig, wenn Sie in das dünnbesiedelte 
australische 


Hinterland kommen.  Planen Sie Ihre Fahrt mit guten 
Straßenkarten, 


bleiben Sie auf bekannten Straßenabschnitten; prüfen Sie 
Straßenbedingungen und angegebene Einrichtungen vor der 
Abfahrt.  
Nehmen Sie ausreichend Proviant und Benzin mit und 
mindestens 4-5 
Liter Wasser täglich pro Person.  Trinken Sie regelmäßig 
genügend 
Wasser.  Bleiben Sie bei einer
Panne bei Ihrem Fahrzeug und meiden Sie die Sonne!<p>


<h3>Automobilclubs in Australien</h3>
Bringen Sie die Mitgliedskarte Ihres
Automobilclubs mit für evtl. kostenlose
Pannenhilfe, Reiseführer, Straßenkarten,
Hotel- und Campingführer.  Weitere
Informationen erhalten Sie von:<p>
Automobile Association of Australia,<br>
21 Northbourne Ave,<p> Canberra ACT 2601<p>
Tel.:	(06) 247 7311<br> Fax: (06) 257 5320.<p>

<h3>Fähre noch Tasmanien</h3>
Zwischen Australien und Tasmanien setzt
Sie die Fähre Spirit of Tasmania über die
Bass-Straße.<p>

<h3>Mietwagen</h3>
Auf Flughäfen und Hauptbahnhöfen, in Städten und 
Urlaubsorten gibt 


es Mietwagenfirmen.  Leihwagen können bei der Ankunft 
gemietet 
werden, jedoch ist es besonders in den Schulferien 
ratsam, im 
voraus zu buchen.<p>

Die meisten Autovermieter stellen Straßenkarten für Ihre 
Reiseroute 


zur Verfügung.  Autoverleihfirmen geben Ihnen gerne eine 
Liste 
ihres Niederlassungsnetzes.<p>

Mietpreise richten sich nach Ort, Fahrzeugtyp und 
Mietdauer.  Es 
gibt Wochenpauschalen.  Die Fahrzeuge müssen vollgetankt 
zurückgegeben werden.  Es gibt keine Kilometerbegrenzung 
in
Stadtbereichen.<p>

<h3>Versicherung</h3>
Vollkasko- und Haftpflichtversicherung ist im Mietpreis 
enthalten. 


 Eine private Unfallversicherung kann gegen ein Entgelt 
abgeschlossen werden.  Fahrer unter 25 Jahren müssen 
gegebenenfalls eine Zusatzgebühr entrichten.<p>

<h3>Zahlungsbedingungen</h3>
Die meisten Autovermieter verlangen die Vorlage einer 
Kreditkarte. 


 Bei Barzahlung ist der gesamte Mietpreis sowie Kaution 
für die 
Tankfüllung im voraus fällig.  Die Kaution wird dann bei 
Ablieferung des Fahrzeugs zurückerstattet.<p>

<h3>Campervans und Motorhomes</h3>
Den Kontinent mit dem Camper oder Wohnmobil zu entdecken 
wird 
durch das milde Klima in Australien und die zahlreichen 
Übernachtungsmöglichkeiten auf Campingplätzen 
leichtgemacht.<p>

Ein Campervan ist ein umgebauter Kleintransporter mit 
Hubdach.  
Der Innenraum ist zugleich Wohn- und Schlafraum für zwei 
bis drei 
Personen.<p>

Ein Motorhome hat Platz für 4-6 Personen.  Wohnraum, 
Schlafraum 
mit Einzel- oder Doppelkabine sind auf einem LKW-Chassis 
montiert.
<p>

Ein Campervan läßt sich leichter manövrieren; ein 
Motorhome bietet 


jedoch mehr Platz.  Mit dem Campervan und Motorhome 
können Sie in 
das Stadtzentrum fahren, jedoch nicht in Parkhäusern 
parken.  
Lassen Sie deshalb lieber Ihr Fahrzeug am Stadtrand 
stehen und 
benutzen Sie den öffentlichen Nahverkehr.<p>

Gut ausgestattete Campervans und Motorhomes können 
überall in 
Australien gemietet werden.  Mietpreise variieren je nach 

Mietdauer, Jahreszeit und
Fahrzeugtyp.  Mindestleihdauer ist
gewöhnlich 7 Tage, bei einem Monat oder länger gibt es 
einen 
Preisnachlaß. Im Dezember und Januar (während der 
Schulferien) 
wird gewöhnlich ein Aufpreis von $A 10-15 pro Tag 
berechnet.<p>

<h3>Campingplätze</h3>

Es gibt zahlreiche Campingplätze in schöner Umgebung.  
Grundeinrichtung: Stromanschluß, warmes/kaltes Wasser, 
Duschen, 
Toiletten und Waschmaschinen/Trockner.  Die Plätze kosten 
zwischen 


$A10-18 pro Tag für 2 Personen.  Zeltplätze sind auch 
vorhanden.<p>



Auf vielen Campingplätzen kann man feststehende Wohnwagen 
oder 
Ferienhütten für ca. $A20-70 pro Tag für 2 Personen 
mieten.  
Bettwäsche und Decken werden ebenfalls vermietet.<p>

Vorausbuchung wird empfohlen.  Die australischen 
Automobilclubs 
und staatlichen Fremdenverkehrsämter halten 
Campingplatzverzeichnisse für Sie bereit.<p>

<h3>Motorradverleih</h3>

Motorräder können nur in Neusüdwales und Westaustralien 
gemietet 
werden.  Sie dürfen damit durch das Land fahren, jedoch 
müssendie 
Motorräder beim Vermieter wieder abgegeben werden.<p>

Die Mietpreise liegen zwischen $A60-95 pro Tag und 
$A300-500 pro 
Woche je nach Hubraum.  Eine Kaution von $A500 ist zu 
zahlen.  Für 


längere Mietdauer gibt es Ermäßigung.<p>

<h3>Geländefahrzeuge</h3>

Die meisten Autovermieter setzen bei Fahrern Erfahrung 
mit 
Allradantrieb voraus.  Gute Vorbereitung ist für Ihre 
Reise 
besonders wichtig.  Holen Sie vor und während der Reise 
Rat ein.  
Geben Sie Ihre Reiseroute bei den örtlichen 
Polizeidienststellen 
bekannt.<p><hr>

<h3>Unterkunftsmöglichkeiten:</h3>

Die in Australien vorhandenen Unterkünfte

werden nicht nur den höchsten Qualitätsansprüchen, sondem 
auch 
jedem Geldbeutel gerecht.  Die Unterkünfte umfassen 
Luxushotels, 
Ferienanlagen, bequeme Motels, Appartements und 
Herbergen, Farmen 
und Privathäuser.  Wenn möglich sollten Sie Ihre Zimmer 
im voraus 
buchen.  Sprechen Sie mit Ihrem Reisebüro!<p>

<h3>Standard der Unterkunft</h3>

<ul>Diesem Reiseführer wurde die Sternbewertung des 
Australian 
Automobile Clubs zugrundegelegt.  Die Preise variieren 
gemäß der 
angebotenen Einrichtungen und dem Standort.  Der 
nachstehende 
Zimmernachweis gilt lediglich als Richtlinie und kann 
geändert 
werden.

<li>5 Sterne: Große Hotels von internationalem

Qualitätsniveau (1-2 Personen $A170-350;
Suiten $A400-2100)

<li>4-4,5 Sterne: Außerordentlich gut eingerichtete 
Hotels mit 
großem 
Komfort; (1-2 Personen $A110-240)

<li>3-3,5 Sterne: Gut ausgestattete Hotels mit 
freundlichen 
Zimmern 
(1-2 Personen $A80-180)

1-3 
Schlafzimmer und Wohnbereich, Küche, Waschsalon und

($A120-200)</ul><p><hr>

<h3>Unterkunftsarten:</h3>

<h3>Hotels</h3>

In Australien gibt es viele internationale Hotelgruppen, 
die eine 
qualitativ hochwertige Unterkunft anbieten. In Städten 
und auf dem 


Land stehen darüber hinaus zahlreiche 3- und 4 Sterne 
Hotels zur 
Verfügung.<p>

<h3>Motels</h3>
Eine große Auswahl moderner, komfortabler Motels verteilt 
sich auf 


ganz Australien.  Für den Selbstverpfleger gibt es Zimmer 
mit 
eigenem Bad oder Dusche, Telefon, Fernsehen, 
Einrichtungen, um 
Kaffee oder Tee zuzubereiten und einen Kleinkühlschrank.  
Oftmals 
haben die Motels auch ein Restaurant oder einen 
Swimmingpool.<p>

<h3>Appartements</h3>

Selbstverpflegern stehen ebenfalls

Appartements zur Verfügung, in denen man ungestört ist 
und eine 
Kochmöglichkeit hat.  Wäsche und Kochutensilien werden 
bereitgestellt oder können gegen ein Entgelt gemietet 
werden.  In 
den meisten Städten gibt es eine gute Auswahl an
Ferienwohnungen.<p>

<h3>Ferienanlagen</h3>

Australische Ferienanlagen bieten qualitativ hochwertige 
Dienste 
und Einrichtungen mit einem umfassenden Freizeitangebot 
an.  Viele 


davon haben sich auf das Tauchen, Golf oder Tennisspielen 
und 
Angeln spezialisiert.<p>

<h3>Herbergen</h3>

Es gibt zwei Herbergsarten, die speziell für den 
Reisenden mit 
kleinem Geldbeutel in Frage kommen: private Herbergen für 

Backpacker und Jugendherbergen.  Sie bieten Unterkunft 
für 
Selbstverpfleger mit freundlicher und entspannter 
Atmosphäre.<p>

Von Strandhütten über Baumhäuser in Queensland bis zu 
Berghütten 
in Tasmanien sind Herbergen zum Big Business geworden, da 
die 
Anzahl der Reisenden, die zu Sparpreisen nach Australien 
kommen, 
ständig wächst.<p>

Herbergen sind für Selbstverpfleger, d.h. das Putzen ist 
die 
Pflicht jedes einzelnen, der dort übernachtet.  Das 
Preis-Leistungsverhältnis würde so manchen Reisenden die 
Sprache 
verschlagen, wenn er wüßte, was er für $A 15 und darunter 
bekommen 


kann.  Die Liste der erhältlichen "Extras" ist für diese 
Herbergen 


umfangreich.  Es gibt Einzel- u. Doppelzimmer (Doppel- 
oder 
Einzelbett) sowie große Schlafsäle mit vielen Betten.  In 
manchen 
Herbergen gibt es
 
doppelstöckige Betten, um möglichst viele Personen 
unterzubringen.
<p>

Diese Herbergen bieten Unterkünfte zu Sparpreisen, sind 
rund um 
die Uhr geöffnet und haben ein Mindestmaß an 
Vorschriften.  Es 
gibt keine Altersgrenze und die Zimmergröße ist 
unterschiedlich. 
Übernachtungen kosten durchschnittlich $A12.<p>

Inzwischen gibt es 150 Jugendherbergen (YHA), die in 
Australien 
seit 1939 preiswerte Unterkunft anbieten.  Sie können in

<h3>Übernachtung mit Frühstück</h3>

"Bed and Breakfast" heißt in Australien ein herzliches 
Willkommen 
in einer Pension.  Auf diese Weise lernen Sie das echte 
Australien 


mit seinen unverfälschlichen Menschen kennen.  Bei den 
meisten 
BB-Unterkünften handelt es sich um
Eigenheime, einige Ferienwohnungen und Gästehäuser.  
BB-Unterkünfte sind sehr unterschiedlich. Einige sind in 
einfühlsam sanierten Häusern und Landsitzen, andere in 
Stadthäusern oder üblichen Familienhäusern untergebracht. 

Übernachtung mit Frühstück wird überall in Australien 
angeboten.  
Vergessen Sie jedoch nicht, daß diese Unterkünfte nicht 
denselben 
Komfort bieten wie Hotels.  Es empfiehlt sich stets, im 
voraus 
telefonisch zu reservieren!<p>

Einige BB-Unterkünfte gehören einem Regionalverband an, 
der einen 
Mindeststandard der vorhandenen
Einrichtungen garantiert.  Verbandsmitglieder haben neben 
ihrer 
Eintragung ein Symbol. Eine Übernachtung mit Frühstück 
kostet in 
der Regel $A50-100.  Kreditkarten werden nicht 
angenommen.<p>

<h3>Auf dem Bauernhof</h3>

Es gibt viele herrliche Bauernhöfe, die eine gemütliche 
Atmosphäre 


bieten und auf das Detail achten.  Viele 5-Sterne Hotels 
versuchen 


ihren Gästen dies mit großer Mühe anzubieten.  
Aufenthalte auf dem 


Bauernhof beinhalten Mahlzeiten und Unterbringung auf dem 
Land.  
Die Palette erstreckt sich von einfacher, komfortabler 
bis zur 
Luxusunterkunft.  Die Bauernhofaufenthalte unterscheiden 
sich von 
anderen Unterkunftsmöglichkeiten dadurch, daß die 
Bauernhöfe 
bewirtschaftet werden.  Die Gäste werden somit in der 
Familie 
aufgenommen und im Haus oder angrenzenden
Wohngebäuden untergebracht.<p>

Bauernhöfe unterscheiden sich sehr: Farmhäuser, kleine 
Gehöfte in 
Agrargebieten bis zu abgelegenen Outback-Stationen.  
Manche Farmen 


haben sich auf besondere Urlaubsaktivitäten 
spezialisiert: Reiten, 


Skifahren, Buschwanderungen in Nationalparks, Vogel- und
Tierbeobachtung, Angeln, Tennis oder Schwimmen.  Einige 
Farmer 
holen die Gäste vom Bahnhof oder Flughafen ab.  
Erkundigen Sie 
sich bei der Buchung.<p>

Der Tagespreis liegt bei $A75-300 pro Person und 
beinhaltet 
Unterkunft, eigenes Bad/WC, alle Mahlzeiten, Aktivitäten 
und 
Anfahrten.  Buchen Sie Ihren Urlaub auf dem Bauernhof bei 
State 
Travel Centres oder State Motoring Associations.<p>

<h3>Country Pubs</h3>

Wenn Sie mit dem Auto unterwegs sind, sollten Sie 
keinesfalls die 
Wirtshäuser auf dem Land, das sog.  Country Pub 
übersehen.  
Eiskaltes Bier, Mahlzeiten und einfache komfortable 
Unterkunft 
werden dem Durchreisenden geboten.  Für eine Übernachtung 
zu $A35 
brauchen Sie nicht allzu tief in die Tasche zu greifen.<p>


<h3>Campingplätze</h3>

Es gibt keine bessere Art, Australiens beeindruckende 
Natur zu 
erleben, als zu Zelten oder den Schlafsack unter dem 
südlichen 
Himmel auszurollen.  Wegen seiner Größe, geringen 
Bevölkerungsdichte und der unterschiedlichen Landschaften 
ist 
Australien das Land für den begeisterten Camper.<p>

Ganz einfach ein Zelt irgendwo in der Natur 
aufzuschlagen, 
verkörpert das Leben im Freien.  Obwohl das in den 
meisten 
Gegenden Australiens kein Problem ist, sollte man doch 
folgendes 
beachten.  Auf Privatgrundstücken muß man eine 
Zelterlaubnis 
einholen.  Manche Gebiete verbieten das Zelten oder es 
gibt 
bestimmte Vorschriften.  Erkundigen Sie sich entweder auf 
der 
Gemeinde oder fragen Sie bei der Polizei.<p>

Wenn Sie im Freien zelten, sollten Sie immer einen Kocher 

mitnehmen.  In manchen Gebieten Australiens ist es 
während des 
Sommers wegen
Waldbrandgefahr verboten, ein Lagerfeuer zu machen.<p>

Wohnwagenplätze bieten die

Bequemlichkeit und Sicherheit eines

eingerichteten Campingplatzes.  In Australien gibt es ein 

umfangreiches Netz gut ausgestatteter Wohnwagenplätze in 
allen 
wichtigen Touristengebieten und den meisten Städten.  
Ausgezeichnete landesweite Campingplatzführer gibt es von 

Automobilclubs, wie z.B. NRMA in Neusüdwales.  Falls Sie 
Mitglied 
bei einem Automobilclub sind, erhalten Sie diese Führer 
kostenlos 
oder zu einem ermäßigten Preis.<p>

Die Einrichtungen sind unterschiedlich: Stromanschluß, 
warmes/kaltes Wasser, Duschen, WC, Waschmaschinen/ 
Trockner.  Der 
Platz kostet zwischen $A8-15 pro Tag für 2 Personen.  
Viele 
Wohnwagenplätze vermieten feste Wohnwagen oder Hütten ab 
$A16-65 
für 2 Personen.  Meistens können Sie Wäsche und Decken 
mieten.<p>

In den National Parks ist das Zelten in bestimmten 
Gebieten 
erlaubt.  Hier gibt es Bush Camps (einfache sanitäre 
Einrichtungen), deren Preise sich von Park zu Park 
unterscheiden.  


Beliebte Plätze müssen vor Schulferienbeginn gebucht 
werden.  
Selbstverständlich sind in Nationalparks oder 
Naturschutzparks 
besondere Umweltschutz- und
Sicherheitsvorschriften zu beachten.  Häufig sind 
Lagerfeuer 
untersagt, deshalb brauchen Zelter immer einen Kocher.  
Waldbrände 


sind insbesondere während der Sommermonate eine große 
Gefahr.  
Daher müssen die Warnungen unbedingt befolgt werden.<p>

Lassen Sie sonst guten Menschenverstand walten.  Lassen 
Sie keinen 


Abfall zurück, waschen Sie sich nicht in Flüssen oder 
Seen 
(Waschmittel, Zahnpasta und Seife sollten nicht benutzt 
werden, da 


sie für Fische und Natur schädlich sind).  Schlagen Sie 
Ihr Zelt 
auf bereits bestehenden Plätzen auf. Wenn Sie ein 
Lagerfeuer 
machen, benutzen Sie nur abgestorbenes Holz. (Das Absägen 
von 
Bäumen wird strafrechtlich geahndet.) Jeder Bundesstaat 
hat eine 
unabhängige Nationalparkbehörde, die Führer mit 
Einzelheiten über 
die Einrichtungen des Parks herausbringen.  Hierzu 
gehören New 
South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria, Northern Territory und 
Queensland.<p>

Die staatlichen australischen Motororganisationen und die 
lokalen 
Fremdenverkehrsämter veröffentlichen Führer über Zelt- 
und 
Wohnwagenplätze.<p><hr><p>

<BODY><BODY BACKGROUND="leinen3.jpg">



	<h3>Staatsform: </h3>Barbados ist unabhängiges Mitglied des Britischen Commonwealth. 
Staatsoberhaupt ist die englische Königin, die durch den Generalgouverneur repräsentiert wird.<p>

 
	<h3>Strände: </h3>Die Küste von Barbados besteht zu 85% aus herrlichen Stränden mit feinem, 
	weißem Sand. Vor allem die West- und Südküste sind beliebt wegen der ruhigen See. <p>

<img src="barbad5.jpg" align=right>

	<h3>Tauchen: </h3>Die atemberaubende Unterwasserwelt der Insel mit Korallenriffen 
	und vielen buntschillernden Fischen ist 
	ein wahres Paradies für Taucher.<p>

 
	<h3>Taxis: </h3>Am Flughafen, in Badeorten und 
	an den meisten Hotels stehen Taxis bereit. Im allgemeinen werden feste 
Fahrpreise verlangt. Da die Wagen jedoch 
	nicht mit einem Taxameter ausgestattet 
	sind, ist es empfehlenswert, den Preis 
	für eine Inselrundfahrt im voraus zu 
	vereinbaren.<p>

 
	<h3>Trinkwasser: </h3>Barbados ist eine der wenigen karibischen Inseln, wo man Leitungswasser 
	gefahrlos trinken kann, da es durch den geologischen Unterbau aus Kalkstein und Korallen 
	gefiltert wird und anschließend nach nur geringfügiger chemischer Behandlung klar und rein 
	aus dem Wasserhahn fließt.<p>

<img src="barbad11.jpg" align=left> 
	<h3>Unterkunft: </h3>Die 150 Hotels auf Barbados verfügen über 
	insgesamt ca. 12.000 Betten. Außerdem gibt es Pensionen, 
	Apartments und komplett möblierte Villen. Die Preise 
	variieren von weit unter DM 60,-- pro Nacht für ein 
	einfaches Apartment bis zu mehr als DM 600,-- für eine 
	Übernachtung in den feinsten Luxushotels.<p>

 
	<h3>Währung: </h3>Die landesübliche Währung auf Barbados ist der 
	Barbados Dollar (BDS$), der an den US-Dollar gebunden 
	ist. 1 US Dollar = 2 BDS Dollar. Alle gängigen 
Kreditkarten wie American Express, Visa, Eurocard, Diner´s usw. 
	werden von den meisten Hotels, Restaurants und zahlreichen 
	Geschäften akzeptiert. Achtung! Euroschecks werden nicht 
	angenommen! Empfehlenswert sind Traveller Cheques; 
überall in Barbados kann mit US $ bezahlt werden.<p>

<img src="barbad9.jpg" align=right>
 
	<h3>Wassersport: </h3>Zur Auswahl stehen u.a. Windsurfen, 
Katamaransegeln, Wasserski und Parasailing. Besonders an der 
	Südküste finden sich ideale Bedingungen für Windsurfer. Ein 
	Begriff unter Wellenreitern ist das Fischerdorf Batsheba in 
	St. Joseph.<p> 


	<h3>Wildparks: </h3>In den Wildparks von Barbados (Wildlife Reserve 
	und Welchman Hall Gully) kann man wilde Affen in ihrer natürlichen Umgebung beobachten. 
	Der Oughterson National Wildlife Park ist ein Naturlehrpark für Jung und Alt mit Affen, 
	tropischen Vögeln, Krokodilen, Schlangen und Schildkröten.<p>

	<h3>Geschichte: </h3>Die ersten Bewohner von Barbados waren die Arawak- und Carib-Indianer. Die 
	Insel wurde 1536 von portugiesischen Seefahrern auf dem Weg nach Brasilien entdeckt. Sie 
	tauften sie "Los Barbados", weil die Luftwurzeln der Bäume an Bärte erinnerten. 1966 
	erhielt Barbados die Unabhängigkeit. <p>

	<h3>Geographische Lage: </h3>Barbados ist die am weitesten östlich gelegene Karibikinsel, 
eingebettet zwischen der Karibischen See und dem Atlantik. Vor allem an der atlantischen 
	Seite  der Nord- und Ostküste  findet man rauhe See und hohe Wellen, während das Meer im 
	Westen und Süden der Insel ruhiger ist. <p>

	<h3>Harrison's Cave: </h3>Harrison's Cave bietet ein atemberaubendes Naturschauspiel. 
Regentropfen haben eindrucksvolle unterirdische Höhlen mit unzähligen Stalagmiten und 
	Stalaktiten geschaffen sowie 2 Flüsse, Becken und einen Wasserfall.<p>
 
	<h3>Klima: </h3>Auf Barbados herrscht ein angenehmes Klima mit einer durchschnittlichen 
Temperatur von 26°C. Die Sonne scheint an über 3.000 Stunden im Jahr. <p>


	<h3>Landschaft: </h3>Die birnenförmige Insel hat eine Fläche von ca. 430 km² und ist ca. 30 km 
	lang und 20 km breit. Die Landschaft ist überwiegend flach, steigt jedoch in sanften 
	Terrassen von Westen nach Osten an bis zum höchsten Punkt, dem Mount Hillaby in St. Thomas 
	mit 350 m.<p> 

	<h3>Leihwagen: </h3>Die Insel kann man ideal mit dem Leihwagen entdecken. Auf Barbados herrscht 
	Linksverkehr. Man benötigt einen gültigen Führerschein sowie einen lokalen Führerschein, 
	der gegen eine kleine Gebühr bei Autovermietungen und Polizeistationen erhältlich ist.<p>

 
	<h3>Märkte: </h3>Auf den Märkten wird viel frisches Obst und Gemüse angeboten. Sie sind der 
	ideale Ort, mit der einheimischen Bevölkerung in Kontakt zu kommen. In Bridgetown gibt es 
	Märkte an der Cheapside, der Fairchild Street und in Oistins einen Fischmarkt.<p> 

<img src="barbad7.jpg" align=left>
	<h3>Öffentliche Verkehrsmittel: </h3>Das öffentliche Verkehrsnetz ist ausgezeichnet. Busse in 
	den gelben und blauen Nationalfarben von Barbados unterhalten ausgedehnte Liniendienste 
	auf der Insel. Eine einfache Fahrt kostet ca. DM 1,10. <p>


	<h3>Party Cruises: </h3>"Bajan Queen" und "Jolly Roger" bieten 
	vierstündige Kreuzfahrten mit Life-Musik, einer Bar und 
	Barbecue-Buffet. Oder genießen Sie die elegante Atmosphäre 
	an Bord der "Harbour Master", mit eigenem Tauchboot, 
	Restaurant, Theater, Nachtclub, Veranstaltungsbereich und 
	einer der größten Bars in Barbados.<p> 


	<h3>Plantagen: </h3>In mehreren großen, mit authentischen Möbeln 
	eingerichteten Herrenhäusern der früheren Plantagenbesitzer (z. B. Nicholas Abbey in 
	St. Peter und Villa Nova in St. John) kann man sich einen Eindruck verschaffen, wie die 
	Zuckerbarone im Kolonialzeitalter gelebt haben.<p> 


	<h3>Religion: </h3>Religion spielt im Leben der Bajans eine große Rolle. Barbados hat über 140 
	verschiedene Kirchen. Die Bevölkerung ist jedoch überwiegend evangelisch.<p> 


	<h3>Sport: </h3>Barbados´ Nationalsport ist Cricket. Während der Saison von Mai bis Dezember 
	finden überall Spiele statt. Ein anderer, typisch englischer Sport ist Polo. Die 
Möglichkeiten sportlicher Betätigung sind weitreichend: Windsurfen, Wasserski, Tennis, 
	Squash, Basketball, Volleyball, Netzball, Hockey, Rugby, Fußball, Bridge, Schach, Domino, 
	Billard, Darts, Pferderennen, Reiten, Radfahren, Wandern, Schießen, Judo, Karate, 
Autorennen. Golfplätze befinden sich bei den Hotels Sandy Lane, St. James, Rockley Resort 
	Hotel, Christ Church und Almond Beach Resorts, St. James. Der neu eröffnete Golfplatz 
	Westmoreland in St. James bietet sogar eine 27-Loch Anlage.<p><hr>

<br clear=all>

<p><hr><p>

The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is not a government.  It's a term used to describe the five regions surrounding Toronto.  The province and municipalities (on a voluntary basis) have been meeting to discuss common issues since the late 1980s.
<p>

The population of the GTA is 4.5 million and grows by 100,000 each year.

Metro Council meets every other Wednesday. Coverage of Metro Council meetings is on Cable 10 from 9:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m., 2 p.m. - 6:30 p.m., and 8 p.m. until the adjournment of Council.  Immediately following Metro Council breaks, reporters question councillors live about issues of the day.  Normally, only the Wednesday session of Council is broadcast, even if the meeting runs longer than one day.
<p>
MetroMatters is a live Metro affairs phone-in show that airs on Cable 10 from 7 - 8 p.m, on non-Council Wednesdays.  The show is hosted by Heather Kerr.  Metro councillors and Chairman Tonks are frequent guests on the show.

The Levels of Government in Canada
</b></font>
<br clear=all>

<p><hr><p>

<font size=+2><b><i>Where does Metro fit in?</i></b></font>
<p>

Metropolitan Toronto is in Ontario and Ontario is in Canada.  Sounds easy?  Well, the local government process is just as easy, once you understand how each level fits into the government framework of this country.                         
<br>
<p>
Let's start with Canada.  The level of government that is responsible for matters that affect all of Canada is called the Canadian or federal government.  It is the largest government in Canada and is headed by the Prime Minister.  It is the level of government responsible for areas such as foreign policy, taxation, currency and banking, criminal law and procedure, defence, citizenship, postal services, unemployment insurance and national economic policy.
<br>
<p>
Canada is made up of 10 provinces and two territories.  Each province has its own government, with a Premier as the head, to look after matters that affect that province.  This is the level of government that is responsible for health services, tourism, natural resources, highways, hospitals, native affairs and worker's compensation to name but a few areas. 
<p>
Within the provinces are the municipal or local levels of government.  If you live in the City of <a href="http://www.city.toronto.on.ca">Toronto</a>, <a href="http://www.city.north-york.on.ca/">North York</a>, <a href="http://www.city.scarborough.on.ca">Scarborough</a>, <a href="../council/maps/etobicoke.html">Etobicoke</a>, <a href="../council/maps/york.html">York</a> or the <a href="../council/maps/east_york.html">Borough of East York</a>, you live in one of the six area municipalities.  But, you also live in The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto.  Municipal government in Metropolitan Toronto is organized as a two-tier system of government.

<p>
A two-tier or two-level system of government means that The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto--or Metro as it is commonly called--and the area municipalities share in the delivery of municipal services.  For instance, Metro is responsible for those services which are most economically or effectively provided on a larger geographic scale such as <a href="../services/abc/police.html"> policing</a>, <a href="../services/abc/ttc.html">public transit</a>, <a href="../services/departments/community_services.html#seniors">homes for the aged</a>, <a href="../services/departments/ambulance.html">ambulance services</a>, <a href="../services/departments/community_services.html#social">welfare assistance</a>, solid <a href="../services/metro_works/waste/index.html">waste</a> disposal and <a href="../services/metro_works/water/index.html">water</a> supply. 

<p>
The area municipalities, on the other hand, are responsible for providing services of a more local nature such as garbage collection, fire protection, local parks, marriage licenses, building by-laws, local libraries and public health services.

<p>
For over forty years Metro and the area municipalities have worked together to serve the needs of its residents--now over 2.3 million.  This union is reflected in the logo of The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto: six interlocking rings that symbolize the member municipalities.  By working together, residents receive the highest quality of municipal services possible.

<BR CLEAR=ALL>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B><I>How it all started</I></B></FONT>
<P>


In 1953, the Province of Ontario passed The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Act.  This
Act created a federated system of government made up of the 13 municipalities in the area.  By
joining together, the municipalities could provide effective and efficient delivery of many
government services.
<P>

The need for cooperation among the municipalities and the coordination of services was
recognized in the first decade following World War II.  A sudden increase in population
meant an increase in the demand for municipal services.  The numerous municipalities,
working independently to meet the needs of their residents, resulted in an unnecessary
duplication of services.
<P>

To solve this problem, the province created a two-tier system of government with a
re-designed structure for service delivery--the first such structure in North America.
<P>

In 1967, the original municipalities were regrouped to form the six municipalities that exist
today: the cities of <A HREF="http://www.city.toronto.on.ca">Toronto</A>, <A HREF="http://www.city.north-york.on.ca/">North York</A>, <A HREF="http://www.city.scarborough.on.ca">Scarborough</A>, <A HREF="../council/maps/etobicoke.html">Etobicoke</A>, <A HREF="../council/maps/york.html">York</A> and the <A HREF="../council/maps/east_york.html">Borough of East York</A>. Together, these municipalities form The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto--the largest municipality in Ontario and Canada, and the sixth largest government in Canada in terms of population.
<P>

The goal of the Metro government is best understood through its mission statement:
<P>
<B>The purpose of the Government of Metropolitan Toronto is to build and sustain a diverse urban community, one that is socially, economically and environmentally healthy.  The rights of individuals must be balanced with the interests of the community as a whole.  A sense of partnership, built on the effective participation of all sectors, must be fostered among its citizens, elected representatives and public servants.</B>
<P>
<B>The Government must ensure that the infrastructure of Metropolitan Toronto is sound and well serviced, within a stable financial framework, and it must provide effective, co-operative leadership on multi-jurisdictional issues.
</B>

<font size=+4><b>Metro standing committees</b></font>
<br clear=all>

<p><hr>

Standing committees help Council in the decision-making process. By considering and debating the various reports received from Metro departments, agencies, boards and commissions, the committees are able to make decisions themselves or to provide Council with a recommendation.
<p>
In 1994, the number of standing committees was reduced from seven committees to five. They are: Financial Priorities Committee; Planning and Transportation Committee; Environment and Public Space Committee; Human Services Committee and the Corporate Administration Committee.
<p>
Each committee has 12 <a href="../you/committees_council.html">members</a> except the Financial Priorities Committee, which has 11 members. The Financial Priorities Committee recommends to Council the budget allocations for each standing committee, taking into consideration the approved corporate priorities. The committees set service priorities and recommend budgetary allocations for the operations under their control. They also make sure the services they are responsible for are delivered effectively and efficiently.
<p>
The new structure offers better ways for Metro to meet the needs of residents. The operations of departments and agencies will be coordinated better by standing committees. Grouping like services in fewer committees will improve the coordination of issues and make it easier for the public to take part in Metro government.
<p>
Metro's standing committees meet once every four weeks. For the dates of committee meetings and the exact locations, please contact Access Metro at (416) 392-8000.

<p><a name="special"><hr></a><p>

<b>Special Committees</b>
<p>
<ul>In addition to the standing committees, there are also several special committees which Council members may belong to.
<p>
The Striking Committee and the Nominating Committee are two examples of special
committees. The Striking Committee considers and recommends Council members for various standing committees and agencies, boards and commissions. The Nominating Committee interviews and recommends citizen members to various agencies, boards and commissions.
<p>
Special task forces or steering committees are established on an as-needed basis, for a limited time, to examine specific policy or program issues. Task forces which have been organized in the past include: the Metro Youth Task Force, the Social Development Strategy Task Force and the Task Force on the Reform of Municipal Financing.
<p>
A special committee is the Political Steering Committee for the Review of Government in Metropolitan Toronto. It is made up of Metro, area municipal and provincial members. It is working on making municipal government as efficient as possible and is seeking ways of reducing duplication.</ul>

<P>
As a part of Metro's policy of open and accessible government, the Metropolitan Toronto government encourages public participation in its decision-making process.
<P>
People <A HREF="#address">write in</A> or <A HREF="#fax">fax</A> and can now <A HREF="mailto:metroclerk@metrodesk.metrotor.on.ca">e-mail</A> their comments and concerns.
<P>
Participation also includes the opportunity for interested parties to appear at meetings of the standing committees of Metro Council to speak on matters of concern.
<P>
These <A HREF="/services/departments/schedule/schedule.htm">committees meet </A>once a month to review policy and operating matters under their jurisdiction, and their recommendations are then submitted to the full Metro Council for consideration.
<P>
Contact the <A HREF="#secretary">committee secretary</A> in the Metro Clerk's department who is responsible for the committee you wish to appear before, prior to the meeting.  Let the committee secretary know that you wish to make a deputation on a particular issue on the agenda.
<P>
Members of the public may also write in to the appropriate committee and request to speak on a matter not on a current agenda.
<P>
<B>The following points are intended to assist you in making deputations before Metro committees:</B>
<UL>
	<LI>Deputations are usually heard as a first matter of business at the meeting.
	<LI>Committees may decide to hear deputations at specific times during their meetings.
	<LI>Each deputation is limited to 5 minutes in order to provide as many people as possible the opportunity to speak. Members of the committee may then ask questions of the speaker.
	<LI>A written submission may be presented, but it is not necessary. Written comments may also be submitted without making a verbal presentation.
	<LI>If an organization wishes to address a committee, one person should be chosen to represent the group.
	<LI>Audio visual equipment is available, if required.
	<LI>Facilities are available for graphics presentations from your lap-top computer.
	<LI>Translation services are available and can be arranged in advance.
	<LI>Following the decision of Council, interested parties are advised of the outcome of the issue.
</UL>

The committee secretary is available to provide additional assistance with respect to individual committees.

<font size=+4><b>Metro's Election Process</b></font>
<br clear=all>

<hr><p>

<ul>Metro councillors are elected directly to Council rather than being appointed by the area municipalities.  Residents vote for councillors according to the ward or geographic area that they live in.  For example, if you live in the Etobicoke Kingsway-Humber ward, you would vote for someone who is campaigning in that ward.  Within Metro Toronto there are 28 wards with an average of 80,000 people in each ward.
<p>

Mayors, on the other hand, sit on Metro Council by virtue of being elected as mayor in their area municipality.  They provide an important link between Metro and the area municipalities.  The six mayors are the only members of Council who serve on both the municipal council for their area municipality and Metro Council.
<p>
Mayors, Metro and area municipal councillors, school board trustees and public utility commissioners are all elected for a three-year term.  Elections for all positions are always held on the second Monday in November.  The area municipalities organize the municipal and school board election process.  The next municipal election will be in November 1997.
<p>
If you are interested in running as a candidate for local office, contact the clerk of your local area municipality to find out whether or not you are eligible.</ul>

<center><h1>Water Supply</h1></center>
Metro Works runs an extensive water treatment system sitting on the shores of Lake Ontario. In Metro WorksWorld, you can find information about the system and our programs, as well as answers to some frequently asked questions on water supply and sewage
treatment.<p>
It's a complex task, taking water from Lake Ontario and making it
fit to drink.  Metro WorksWorld will enable you to discover the
history of water in Metro Toronto and information about our
individual treatment plants.

<center><h1>Solid Waste Management</h1></center>

Solid waste management has been an issue of considerable debate since the very beginnings of our community.  <P>
Listed below are several factsheets prepared by Metro Works, designed to inform you on how solid waste is managed in Metro Toronto.  The information presented below will provide you with details on Metro Works transfer stations, landfill sites and our
Materials Recovery Facility, integral components of Metro Works solid waste management system.  You'll also learn about programs geared to the Industrial, Commercial and Institutional sector as well as how to request a tour of our facilities or a
presentation on Metro's solid waste management programs.

<font size=+2><b><i>Garbage or Recycling hasn't been picked up?</i></b></font>
<p>

Each city or borough in Metro Toronto collects <a href="blue_box.html">Blue Box</a> materials and garbage.  Metro then processes and sells the recyclables and disposes of the garbage in a <a href="#landfill">sanitary landfill</a>.  The only exception to this is the city of North York, who processes and sells its own recyclables.
<p>

If you have questions about the collection of garbage or <a href="blue_box.html">Blue Box materials</a>, please call your city or borough's works department:

<center><h1>Household Hazardous Waste</h1></center>

The role of Metro Works' household hazardous waste initiative is to help divert toxic materials from entering our landfill sites. Through the program, Metro Works accepts household hazardous waste at eight permanent depots: five at Metro Works transfer stations, one at Metro's Materials Recovery Facility and one each at the Keele Valley and Brock West landfill sites.<P>
The factsheets listed below will provide you with information on the proper management and disposal of household hazardous waste in your home.  For more information, call (416) 392-4330.

Ashbridge's Bay Park was named after Sarah Ashbridge, a Quaker widow and United Empire Loyalist from Philadelphia who settled here in 1793 and obtained a Crown land grant in 1799 for a farm.  The marshes in the bay and lower Don Valley surrounding the Ashbridge's farm were very important habitat for waterfowl, including loons, wild geese, and wild swans.  Her two sons, John and Jonathan, fought in the War of 1812 and were involved in the Rebellion of 1837.  They lived at their waterfront farm until their deaths; Jonathan died in 1845 and John in 1861. 
<P>
Ashbridge's Bay originally extended from Cherry Street to Woodbine Avenue although lake filling for industrial uses has claimed most of the marshlands.  The Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority acquired the remaining land from the Metropolitan Toronto Works Department and the Toronto Harbour Commission in 1972 for a lakefill extension into Lake Ontario.  A waterfront park was developed public  recreation purposes which officially opened in 1977.

The Betty Sutherland Trail follows the meanders of the East Don River from Duncan Mill Road to Sheppard Avenue.  A small community called Oriole developed at the Leslie Street and Sheppard Avenue intersection during the late 1800's.  It was probably named after the many Baltimore Orioles which inhabited the area during the summer months.  Some of the land in this area belonged to George S. Henry, Premier of Ontario from 1930 to 1934.  Henry purchased the south-east corner of Sheppard Avenue and Leslie Street from James Stewart in 1898 and established Oriole Lodge Farms, a dairy farm with over eighty Holstein cows.  His original farmhouse still overlooks the river valley.
<P>
Betty Sutherland served thirteen years as an elected representative of North York Council until her retirement from politics in 1985.  From 1979 to 1985, Mrs. Sutherland was a member of Metropolitan Toronto Council and the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority.  Devoted to the improvement of recreational opportunities for citizens and visitors to Metro Toronto, Mrs. Sutherland was Chairman of Metropolitan Toronto's Parks, Recreation and Property Committee from 1982 to 1985, and a member of the Authority's Don Valley Advisory Board from 1981 to 1984.  The trail was named in her honour by Metropolitan Toronto Council on March 1, 1988, in recognition of her significant contribution to the development of the regional parks system.  Following trail construction, Metro Park & Culture's landscape naturalization efforts included the planting of native trees, shrubs and wildflowers.  These plantings enhance biodiversity and improve wildlife habitat.

Bluffer's Park was designed to improve public access to the waterfront along the base of the Scarborough Bluffs.  Brimley Road was one of the few locations where a descent to Lake Ontario was possible.  Originally owned by the Borough of Scarborough, the mainland at the base of the bluffs was transferred to the
Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority in May 1960 as part of the Waterfront Plan for Metropolitan Toronto.
<P>
The park was developed in two stages by the Authority.  The first phase satisfied a need for public open space and was officially completed and opened in 1975 at a cost of $2.2 million.  Phase two, developed for $6.0 million and completed in the early 1980's, provided public launching facilities for recreational boaters and sailors, as well as open space for private yacht clubs.  A total of 2.6 million cubic metres of lakefill was used at Bluffer's Park.  On top of the bluffs a large meadow offers an excellent view of the sandstone cliffs, Bluffer's Park and beyond.  The Park & Culture Department is responsible for the maintenance and operation of this waterfront park.

The tall spires of the eroded sandstone cliffs in Cathedral Bluffs Park rise more than 90 metres above Lake Ontario.  This is the highest point along the bluffs, a result of the coincidence of the Lake Ontario and glacial Lake Iroquois shorelines. 
<P>
At one time, much of the parkland belonged to the Sisters of St. Joseph, whose property extended from Kingston Road to the lake.  The land for Cathedral Bluffs Park was finally acquired from Dolphin Developments by Metropolitan Toronto in January 1960, after the company proposed to develop a residential neighbourhood on the property.  During the approval process for the Cathedral Bluffs neighbourhood, the Metropolitan Toronto Planning Board recommended the subdivision be approved on the condition that the southern section be acquired for public open space.

Appropriately situated on the water's edge, Cliff Lumsdon Park offers a spectacular vantage point of Lake  Ontario and the east waterfront to downtown Toronto.  Before becoming waterfront parklands, the Metro Works Department had used this location for the New Toronto Filtration Plant (later known as the Lake Shore Pumping Station).  When this local water supply system was replaced in 1968 by the Metropolitan Waterworks System, the remaining facilities were gradually demolished.  By 1976, jurisdiction of the property was transferred to the then Metro Parks Department. 
<P>
Cliff Lumsdon will be remembered as one of Canada's most outstanding athletes.  Born on April 13, 1931 in Toronto, Lumsdon's long and illustrious swimming career began in the pool at the West End Y.M.C.A. in Etobicoke, near his home.  By the age of eighteen, he had earned international acclaim for long distance swimming, winning the first of his four World Championships.  Seven years later, in 1956, he became the first swimmer to cross the icy waters of the Juan De Fuca Straits from Victoria, British Columbia to Port Angeles, Washington.  
<P>
Cliff Lumsdon was honoured with many awards for his swimming achievements.  In 1949, he was earned the Lou Marsh Trophy as the country's outstanding athlete and in 1976 was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame.  He was inducted into the Order of Canada in 1982.
<P>
Throughout his long career Lumsdon received most of his swimming instruction from Gus Ryder, a legendary coach.  Lumsdon himself went on to coach many top-ranked Canadian swimmers.  He also coached his daughter, Kim Lumsdon, who successfully completed a crossing of Lake Ontario on August 27, 1976. 
<P>
On March 1, 1988, the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto dedicated this park in recognition of Cliff Lumsdon's many outstanding achievements and his lifelong contribution to the community.  He passed away on August 31, 1991.  In 1993, a plaque was unveiled at Cliff Lumsdon Park in his memory.

Colonel Danforth Park recognizes the contribution of an American, Asa Danforth, to the expansion of the Toronto road network beyond Scarborough Township.  He was hired by the government of Upper Canada in 1799 to cut a 33-foot wide highway from the east end of King Street to the mouth of the Trent River, near Trenton, at a negotiated price of $90 per mile.  It was finished just one year later.  Originally the road was to be named Dundas Street after the Secretary of State, but was commonly known as "Danforth's Road" which is still retained in Metropolitan Toronto.  Although the route seems indirect it was typical of the era, following native trails and settlers' paths that bypassed many of the physical obstacles which made travel so difficult 190 years ago.  A number of small communities were also connected by the road. 
<P>
Oddly enough, Danforth was never a commissioned military officer.  The Colonel probably earned his title because many of the labourers were hired from the military and could identify with his hard-driving, disciplined manner.  Almost immediately after its
completion, complaints were raised about the road's construction.  Bridges collapsed and many sections were impassable due to the overgrowth of vegetation and fallen trees.  As a result, Danforth had difficulty collecting his money and land grants promised to his labourers were deferred, so he returned to America a very
disappointed and bitter man.
<P>
In 1962, the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority transferred management responsibilities for Colonel Danforth Park to Metropolitan Toronto after its acquisition from the Township of Scarborough.

Colonel Samuel Smith Park recognizes one of Etobicoke's first settlers.  In 1793, Colonel Samuel Bois Smith of the Queen's Rangers was granted 1680 hectares of Crown land by Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe.  His tract extended from Lake Ontario to Bloor Street and from Kipling Avenue to Etobicoke Creek.  The south-eastern most portion of this land is now part of this waterfront park.  
<P>
Col. Smith played a role in the public administration of Upper Canada.  He was interim president of the colony from May 1817 until August 1818, until Sir Peregrine Maitland arrived from England to replace Francis Gore.  Col. Smith inhabited a modest homestead near the Etobicoke Creek from 1799 until his death in 1826.  Except for a mill built about 1820 and a trail which crossed through the property roughly following today's Lake Shore Boulevard West, Col. Smith's large estate remained undeveloped, impeding local settlement and east-west transportation during the colony's early years.  It would be many years before a suitable road was constructed.
<P>
The park includes lands associated with the former Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital, which was established and operated by the province from 1888 to 1979.  Also known as the Mimico Lunatic Asylum, it was the first asylum in Ontario designed to care for patients using a decentralized "cottage" system, a vast improvement over the less humane institutions at the time.  Generous lands surrounding the facilities were devoted to agriculture and gardening.  The farms and gardens, maintained by patients, were both therapeutic and productive -- a model of self-sufficiency and modern treatment that proved quite successful.  Patients also helped construct many of the buildings here. 
<P>
The former hospital lands are now a significant public greenspace and heritage resource.  An additional lakefill area, created by the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, provides improved access to the lake.  Further landscape naturalization and habitat restoration projects such as the creation of a 3.6 ha wetland (a partnership project between Metro Toronto, M.T.R.C.A., Provincial and Federal governments) and Carolinian tree and shrub plantings will be undertaken.  These will help fulfill Metro's goal of a healthy waterfront that offers unique outdoor recreation opportunities.  Over the next several years parking and washroom facilities, a formal garden and picnic areas will be developed.  In 1993, a segment of the Waterfront Trail traversing the park was completed.  Elements of Col. Samuel Smith Park's unique architectural heritage will be restored to further enhance the beauty and character of this waterfront park.

Coronation Park was created in 1934 when the seawall was extended from Strachan Avenue to Bathurst Street to improve general harbour conditions and extend the C.N.E. regatta course.  Conservationists and war veterans expanded the role of the park to include a commemorative coronation planting.  The planting was inspired by Richard St. Barbe Barker's "Men of the Trees", an international organization known for its promotion of reforestation as a means of uniting nations.
<P>
After detailed planning and design led by F. E. Robinson (President of the Toronto Chapter of Men of the Trees), Thomas Hobbs and Andrew Gillespie (Toronto Ex-Serviceman's Coronation Committee), the planting took place on May 12, 1937, and was considered the largest ceremonial planting in Canada at the time.  A royal oak tree, paying tribute to King George VI, surrounded by a ring of oak trees--symbolizing the countries of the British Empire -- was planted to create a central focus in the park.  A grove of maple trees was also planted in memory of the many Canadian troops who fought overseas, further enhancing this waterfront landscape.
<P>
In 1993, Metro Park & Culture opened the Coronation Park regional softball centre.  This multi-purpose facility includes a pavilion with team changerooms and year-round washrooms for parks visitors.  Offices and storage for parks staff are also provided.  All three slo-pitch softball diamonds are illuminated for night games.

Cudia Park was transferred to the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority from the then Borough of Scarborough in May 1960, and included in the Waterfront Plan for Metropolitan Toronto.  It was acquired as part of program to promote public ownership along the bluffs as a means of curtailing further erosion.  Cudia Park is intended to be part of a continuous strip of parkland along the Scarborough Bluffs that will include footpaths, picnic areas, and structures to improve access to the lake.  Known as Cudia Park before becoming part of the Metro parks system, the name comes from the Cudia family, who were long time residents in the area.

Dentonia Park Golf Course was named after Susan Marie Denton, who arrived from Boston in 1888 to marry Walter Massey.  An established Toronto family, the Masseys were best known for their farm implement company Massey-Harris (later Massey-Ferguson) and their philanthropy which included the construction of Massey Hall.  In 1897, as a source of relaxation and partly to fulfill a dream of owning a farm, Walter Massey bought 100 hectares of table and valley land just outside the city limits and named it Dentonia Park. The farm began to produce fresh eggs and milk to help combat the thousands of deaths occurring from typhoid fever, especially among small children.  Due to the success of the farm within its first years of operation, Massey formed the City Dairy Company. 

In 1901, Walter Massey died after contracting the disease he was trying to fight. Susan Massey continued to live at the farm.  In 1926, she donated part of the land to the City of Toronto for public parkland on the condition that it remain known as Dentonia Park.  She built an enormous 100 room house which was given to the Crescent School for boys in 1933. Dentonia Park Golf Course is situated on part of the old estate. 

In September 1961, Metropolitan Toronto acquired the land from the City of Toronto.  The 13-hectare site was ideally suited for a "pitch and putt" par 3 golf course, and in the spring of 1967 Dentonia Park Golf Course opened at a cost of $350,000.  Without a doubt, Dentonia Park Golf Course is one of the finest and most challenging par 3 facilities in Ontario.  It's perfect for beginners just learning the game or advanced players sharpening their short shots.  An inexpensive family outing -- only minutes from downtown Toronto.

Derrydowns Park occupies a secluded section of the Black Creek valley, north of Grandravine Drive.  The park is named after Derrydown Road, located just east of the park.  Metropolitan Toronto received the parkland from the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority in 1980.  During the early 1800's the area was known as the District of Elia.  It was settled primarily by Pennsylvania Germans, of which the Samuel Snider family were the most prominent in the area bounded by Sheppard Avenue, Keele Street, Finch Avenue, and Jane Street.  They arrived in 1806 and continued to acquire land until the early 1900's.

The Lower Don river follows a narrow, steeply sloped valley south from the Forks of the Don (at the confluence of three tributaries:  the East and West Don rivers and Taylor Creek) to Lake Ontario.  While only 8.0 kilometres long and a small fraction of the watershed's total 360 sq. km. area, the river passes through some of Metro Toronto's most developed and densely populated neighbourhoods.  The Lower Don has held an important role in the region's history as a place of settlement, agriculture and, later, industry.  Present-day efforts to renaturalize the watershed and restore its health will revive the Lower Don's role as a natural greenspace corridor.
<P>
The river valley was an inland transportation route well-known to Native peoples for its abundant hunting and fishing.  European settlement in the Lower Don valley began about 200 years ago.  Fertile floodplain lands were soon cleared by farmers to grow fruits and vegetables.  The wood was used for building and heating.  As mills were established along the river, the watercourse was rerouted and dammed to provide power.  Growing demands for food and manufactured goods such as textiles and leather followed an expanding population in Toronto.  By the 1900's, this once thickly-wooded valley had been reshaped into an industrial and transportation corridor at the expense of greenspace and natural habitats.
<P>
Changes to the valley were obvious.  Most of the mixed deciduous and coniferous forests had disappeared.  South of Gerrard Street the slow, meandering river was straightened and its banks reinforced with wood and steel to control floods (made worse by the disappearance of vegetation).  Marshes and river oxbows were cut-off and filled.  Portions of Lower Don tributaries such as Castle Frank Brook, Rosedale Brook and Mud Creek were buried underground.  This resulted in improved passage for the C.N.R. railway and added industrial lands, while apparently combatting the cholera epidemic (a virus believed to propagate in wetlands).  Railways and roads moved a growing flow of traffic along the floodplain.  In 1892, the Beltline Railway was opened -- a passenger service which linked the city to the new suburban communities of Rosedale, Moore Park and Forest Hill via the Don valley.  New steel bridges at Queen and Bloor Streets spanned the valley.  The Ashbridge's Bay delta, at the mouth of the Don River, was filled in and the river rerouted through the concrete banks of the Keating Channel. 
<P>
The Lower Don became a productive industrial area, valuable for its employment and the goods and services created there.  By the late-1800's, improved transportation and abundant resources like water and clay had attracted manufacturers of paper, bricks, chemicals and beer.  Mill sites located along the Lower Don included Todmorden Mills, Taylor Paper Mills, Don Valley Paper Company, and the Weyborn Degreasing Plant (later owned by Domtar Polyresins).  The Don Valley Brickworks, founded by the Taylor family about 1890, used rock extracted from the nearby valley walls and water from the river to produce much of Toronto's building stone for the next fifty years.  Historic Toronto architecture such as Casa Loma, Massey Hall, the Ontario Legislature, and University of Toronto buildings such as Hart House and Convocation Hall were constructed with Don Valley Brickworks material.  While significant for its role in regional industrial heritage, the north face of the old Brickworks quarry is also recognized internationally for its Pleistocene geology --excavation has revealed a series of glacial and fossil deposits at least 300,000 years old.  In 1984, the Brickworks was acquired for public open space purposes.  A master plan study for the park is presently being conducted by the Brickworks Technical Steering Committee.
<P>
Rapid population growth and automobile-dependent suburbanization following World War II further disconnected the valley's natural communities.  In the 1960's, development of the Don Valley Parkway and the Bayview Avenue Extension ensured the Lower Don would remain an important transportation corridor for Metro Toronto as urban expansion proceeded further and further north.  By the late 1980's, virtually the entire watershed had been urbanized.  The health of the river's headwaters and related wetland habitats were threatened.  River water flowing downstream into the Keating Channel, at the mouth of Lake Ontario, was heavily polluted.
<P>
These conditions caused public attention focus on the need to improve the health of deteriorated greenspace resources.  In this effort, the Don watershed became a case study.  The Royal Commission on the Future of the Waterfront's reports  "Watershed" (1990) and "Regeneration" (1992) suggested a planning strategy that reconnected valley corridor ecosystems to foster the renewal of healthy, self-sustaining natural habitats.  In 1992, a 25-member Don Watershed Task Force was established with a mandate to help the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority develop a regeneration plan for the entire watershed.  The resulting "Forty Steps To A New Don" recommended that regeneration plans for sub-watersheds be guided by a Don Watershed Council, with public and elected officials as members.
<P>
In a spirit of cooperation, communities and municipalities are working together to develop regeneration plans for their local areas.  The Lower Don Task Force's "Bringing Back the Don", is one example of a sub-watershed plan to reconnect the river and its surrounding natural environment.  Metro Park & Culture works together with many local community groups including the Evergreen Foundation and Boy Scouts of Canada on landscape restoration, naturalization and wetland re-establishment projects.  In 1994, the Boy Scouts planted 4800 spruce and pine seedlings in the Lower Don valley.  Many other groups have planted wildflowers and shrubs.  Over time, these efforts will return the watershed to a healthy, self-sustaining condition and provide a model for ecosystem planning in urban communities.

The Lower Don can be reached from Taylor Creek and E.T. Seton parks at the Forks of the Don River, and through the Moore Park and Rosedale ravines, further south.  Don Mills Road, Bayview Avenue, Beechwood Drive, Pottery Road, and Lakeshore Boulevard provide the main road access to the valley.  The Lower Don pedestrian bicycle trail follows the river from Lake Ontario north to the Forks of the Don  River.  The Bloor - Danforth subway crosses the valley --visitors can choose either Castle Frank or Broadview stations although the use of a street map is suggested.  A number of T.T.C. buses can also be taken allowing for many different and interesting routes to be planned.

Don Valley Golf Course opened on August 1, 1956, at cost of $535,000 for land acquisition and course construction.  The river was named in 1793 by Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe after the River Don in Yorkshire, England.  Crown Surveyor Alexander Aiken referred to the Don River as Necheng Qua Kekonk in September 1788, upon surveying the lands purchased from natives.  Wonscoteonoch, meaning "black burnt lands", was another name used, probably signifying that the Don Valley had been swept by fire at one point.

Before its acquisition by Metro Toronto, the land was owned by the City of Toronto and named after W. W. Carson, a prominent civic leader, long-time Hogg's Hollow resident, and a son of the Jolly Miller Inn's proprietor.  In 1954, Hurricane Hazel's impact severely altered the course of the West Don River at York Mills Road and demonstrated the need for a regionally coordinated watershed management strategy.  Metro Toronto purchased 65 hectares of Carson Park in February 1955, released one hectare for new road allowances, and proceeded with development of the Don Valley Golf Course.

After more than 35 years of continuous use, much of the landscaping at Don Valley was beginning to show its age.  While vegetation in and around the course had become well-established, tees and greens were worn out and the irrigation system required replacement.  In 1993, the Park & Culture Department undertook an extensive restoration program for the golf course.  The two year program included improvements such as several hole realignments, the creation of a naturalized wetland "water hazard" and significant drainage and soil modifications to the tees and greens.  Tees and greens will also be enlarged to accommodate the level of play experienced at the course.

Lush vegetation and a rolling landscape present an exciting natural setting for Don Valley Golf Course.  Its classic Howard Watson design has a traditional variety of holes and a legendary reputation for its exciting natural setting.  Hallelujah Corner includes the signature par 5 12th hole followed by an outstanding par 3
challenge, providing breathtaking scenery and spectacular golfing.

Downsview Dells was developed by Metropolitan Toronto in October 1960.  It was called Black Creek Park, but this name led to confusion with Black Creek Pioneer Village in the Black Creek Conservation Area further north.  The name was subsequently changed to Downsview Dells at the request of the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority.  "Downs View" was the name of John Perkins Bull's farm, located in the area during the early 1800's.  Downsview became a well-established agricultural community with mills, general stores, shoemakers and taverns.  The park is located along a secluded, heavily forested section of the Black Creek valley.

Ernest Thompson Seton was born August 14, 1860, in South Shields, Durham, England.  Although he died an American citizen on October 23, 1946, much of his childhood was spent in Toronto.  As a young boy Seton wandered through the ravines of Toronto observing animals in their natural habitat; often painting and sketching these scenes.  In 1897, he won a gold medal from the Ontario College of Art, and received a scholarship to the Royal Academy in London, England.  He was best known for his literary works, having written Wild Animals I Have Known (1898), Two Little Savages (1903), Life Histories of Northern Animals (1909), The Book of Woodcraft and Indian Lore (1912), and Trail of an Artist-Naturalist (1940), as well as numerous articles.  Seton was recognized as the pre-eminent naturalist of the early twentieth century, and furthered this cause by forming the Woodcraft Indians in 1902.  Seton's idea to teach boys about Indian lore and the wilderness was later adopted by Lord Baden-Powell who founded the Boy Scouts.
<P>
E. T. Seton Park is located in the Central Don area of the West Don River valley, south of Eglinton Avenue East.  The parkland was acquired from the Flemingdon Development Corporation in the 1960's for the Metropolitan Toronto Zoo, which was eventually built in the Rouge Valley.  Beginning July 1, 1965, the Province of Ontario leased the north-east corner of the park from Metropolitan Toronto for ninety-nine years to operate the Ontario Science Centre.

Earl Bales Park is located on the site of the old York Downs Golf Course in the West Don River valley.  Tees and greens can still be recognized in the park landscape.  The property was originally owned and settled by John Bales, the great grandfather of Robert Earl Bales.  The historic Bales homestead, built in 1824, remains intact at the north-west corner of the park.  The Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority acquired the parkland in 1972 before transferring management responsibilities to Metropolitan Toronto and the City of North York.  Approximately one-quarter of the park's 58.43 hectares are leased to North York for community recreation purposes.

Robert Earl Bales was 37 years old when elected as Reeve of the Township of North York in 1934.  He was the youngest Reeve in North York's history and later went on to become York County Council Warden after eight years as a council member.  From its inception in 1947 to 1968, he was a member of North York's planning board and its Chairman for many years.  To honour Earl Bales' record of public service in North York, the park was named after him and officially opened on June 19, 1975, by Premier William Davis.

The land in and around the East Don River valley was predominantly used for farmland before suburban housing was built after World War II.  Early settlement included a small community called Flynntown which developed about halfway between Sheppard Avenue and Finch Avenue along Leslie Street.  It was named after the shoemaker Martin Flynn, who operated a small general store and cobblery during the late 1850's. Two sawmills operated along the East Don River: one near Flynntown and another at Finch Avenue.  A brick yard was also located in Flynntown about 1878.  In 1905, a massive steel trestle was built to span the valley for the Canadian Northern Ontario Railroad. 
<P>
In March 1984, the Park & Culture Department began a phased development plan including parking, bridges, washrooms, and a paved trail extending from Duncan Mill Road north past Finch Avenue.  Landscape naturalization, including the planting of native trees, shrubs and wildflowers, has been undertaken following trail development.  In 1994, the rehabilitation of a wet sedge meadow near Cummer Avenue was initiated -- this cooperative effort involving local community groups, the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (in accordance with the Don Watershed Strategy) and Metro Park & Culture will, over time, result in improved wetland habitat conditions and enhanced biodiversity.

East Point Park is one of Metro's largest parkland areas along the Scarborough waterfront -- its unique location near the mouth of the Highland Creek provides an important opportunity to link Lake Ontario waterfront parklands with greenspace in the river valley.  Most of the East Point Park property was acquired by Metro around 1960 from the Township of Scarborough.  By 1979, Metro had
constructed the Highland Creek Sewage Treatment Plant and the F.J. Horgan Filtration Plant at the east and west ends of the property, leaving a large central area to remain as parklands.  Some
additional lands were acquired from the Watford Chemical Company and adjacent residences in the 1970's. 
<P>
Geologic conditions and a moderate climate (due to the proximity of Lake Ontario) have combined to form four significant plant
communities and habitat areas: a railway prairie community, two zones of white bottled-gentian wildflowers, a wetland area, and an old field and woodland community which traces the drainage flows of a ravine leading to the lake shore.  The diversity of plant life found here is due to the imperfectly drained, fertile topsoil found above a series of glacial deposits that form the bluffs.  These bluffs rise in height from 10 M high at the park's east side to 25 M at the west side -- the highest point is over 33 M high.  
<P>
Many different recreational possibilities exist for East Point Park.  The first master plan for the park, published in 1979 by the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, was revised in 1992 to reflect growing public awareness that environmental heritage plays a valuable role in Metro's parks.  An Environmental Impact Study, completed in 1990, and other public submissions sought to sensitively integrate active recreation facilities, such as sports fields, into the larger natural environment.
<P>
In 1995, Metro Park & Culture completed the East Point Park regional softball centre on the west side of the park.  Landscaping of the diamonds includes a perimeter bordered by a naturalized transition zone of indigenous plant materials including white cedar shrubs, a customized wildflower mix which blends seeds from the native plant community, and paper birch, black walnut and red maple trees.  This buffer will provide separation between the softball centre and parklands to the east.  A series of formal and informal trails will integrate the various ecological communities and guide visitors through the park in a manner that minimizes impact on the natural environment.

Edwards Gardens, a picturesque landscape in the Wilket Creek valley, is one of three formal gardens in Metro's regional park system.  Alexander Milne, a Scottish weaver, and his family settled here after the War of 1812.  He began a milling operation and eventually obtained a land title by 1827.  As the Milnes prospered, their farm grew to over 240 hectares and two more mills were added to production.  The farm remained in Milne family ownership for over a century.  For many years the watercourse which passes through Edwards Gardens was known as Milne Creek.
<P>
Rupert E. Edwards purchased the original Milne lot in 1944 as the site for a country home.  Sadly neglected during a series of ownership changes, the valley was little more than a wild tangle of weeds.  Edwards immediately set about creating a 152-metre long rockery (one of the largest in Canada), which required 381 tonnes of Credit Valley limestone and took over three summers to build.  The rockery followed Milne Creek which was intermittently dammed to ensure an adequate water supply for the garden.  Rustic bridges were built to span the creek.  Just as the Milne mills used water wheels for power, Edwards built a steel water wheel to generate electricity to help pump the 364,000 litres of water required each day.  Although providing a scenic backdrop for photographs, the system proved inadequate to meet the electrical needs of the gardens.  For entertainment, Edwards built a 9-hole, par 3 golf course along both sides of the creek. 
<P>
In 1955, the property was sold to Metropolitan Toronto, who in turn leased it to North York Township for maintenance.  Edwards Gardens officially opened in June 1956.  The newly formed Metro Parks Department began maintaining the gardens in 1958 and, two years later, additional land was acquired from the Toronto Suburban Separate School Board and the H.A.W. Plaxton estate to build the Civic Garden Centre and provide additional parking space.

Eglinton Flats is Metropolitan Toronto's largest regional sports field facility. Built on Humber River floodplain, the complex occupies three quadrants at the Jane Street and Eglinton Avenue West intersection. Scarlett Woods Golf Course, also operated by the Park & Culture Department, occupies the fourth quadrant at the south-west corner. In 1972, Metropolitan Toronto Council adopted a development program for South Humber Regional Park including Eglinton Flats. The facility opened in 1977. Six of the twelve pay-as-you-play tennis courts became available for year-round use after an inflatable fabric bubble was installed in 1989.
<P>
The complex takes its name from the area's characteristic landscape and Eglinton Avenue West. Interestingly, this road has an association with sports and contests since it was named after Archibald, the 13th Earl of Eglinton, who held a mock medieval tournament at his castle in France during August 1839. The land at Eglinton Flats was owned by the Scarlett family during the mid-1800's and later used extensively for market gardens until Hurricane Hazel devastated the area in 1954. The Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority acquired the land from the then Borough of York and many private owners before transferring it to the Park & Culture Department for maintenance and operation.

Etienne Brul&eacute Park recognizes the accomplishments of one of North America's earliest explorers.  On September 19, 1615, at the age of twenty, Etienne Brul&eacute became the first European to see Lake Ontario and, later, was probably the first to see Georgian Bay, Lake Huron, Lake Michigan and Lake Superior.  He was also the first European to live among the native people and adopt their customs. 
<P>
Brul&eacute had come to North America as a servant to Samuel de Champlain, the father of the French colony of New France.  In an attempt to win Huron Indian support, Champlain offered to help them wage war against the Five Nation Iroquois Indians of upstate New York.  Champlain sent Brul&eacute to the New York-Pennsylvania border (near the Town of Waverly) to meet an allied tribe known as the Carantouans, and enlist their help with the raid.  From Huron territory around Lake Simcoe, Brul&eacute travelled south along the Holland and Humber Rivers, across Lake Ontario, then through New York to the
Susquehanna River.  
<P>
Although Brul&eacute ultimately deserted the French and was ostracized by Champlain, his exploration of the hinterland was very important to the expansion of the fur trade.  A commemorative plaque and marker is located at South Humber Park. 
<P>
The Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority acquired the land as part of its Watershed Conservation Scheme from various sources including the City of Toronto, the Township of Etobicoke, and private land owners, before transferring management responsibilities to Metropolitan Toronto.

<P>
Marie Curtis Park is situated on both banks of the Etobicoke Creek where it flows into Lake Ontario.  Native people frequently visited the area and named the creek Etobicoke for "place where the wild alders grow". Augustus Jones, a crown-appointed surveyor, Anglicized the name to Black Alders Creek around 1800.
<P>
The park was created in 1954 after the high flood waters caused by Hurricane Hazel devastated a number of low-lying properties.  The disaster prompted provincial and municipal governments to administer flood protection.  Due to their hazardous location on the flood plain, 164 homes were acquired and removed. 
<P>
Public parkland was purchased by the Village of Long Branch, the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, and the Province of Ontario.  An additional gift of the Canadian Arsenals property by the Government of Canada, and some municipal land held by the Village of Long Branch, created a sizable parkland area.  In 1958, two private donations occurred: playground facilities by the Canadian Progress Club (Lakeshore Branch) and a drinking fountain by the Lakeshore Business and Professional Women's Club.  In 1982, the 15.7 hectare Canada Post property, flanking the parks' western edge, was acquired by the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority to be integrated with Marie Curtis Park in the near future.  
<P>
Marie Curtis was first elected as Reeve of the Village of Long Branch in 1953, a position she held until 1962.  She was a member of the first Metro Council which began January 12, 1954, and later played an instrumental role in the formation of a regional parkland system in Metropolitan Toronto.  In recognition of her outstanding contributions the park was named in her honour on June 5, 1959.

This extensive parkland, located in the West Don River valley north of Finch Avenue, was assembled by the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority in 1972 primarily for flood control purposes.  The Park & Culture Department developed the park, which offers both passive and active recreational areas.

The park was named after Dr. G. Ross Lord, P. Eng., in recognition of his service as the chairman of the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority from 1958 to 1972.  He advanced the cause of conservation for a further six years as a provincial appointee at the Authority.  Dr. Lord was also one of Canada's foremost hydraulic and flood control engineers.

<P>
Glen Rouge Park, in the Rouge River valley, contains the only fully-serviced campground within the Metro parks system.  Like other river valleys in Metropolitan Toronto, the Rouge valley sustained serious damage from the flood waters of Hurricane Hazel in 1954.  As a result of this natural disaster, the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority began a floodplain acquisition program in the early 1960's to limit private ownership and development of the floodplain.  Upon acquisition, lands were transferred to
Metropolitan Toronto Park & Culture Department for development and maintenance. 
<P>
When a 93-hectare parcel was acquired by the M.T.R.C.A. in 1974, it included Graham Park, a 100-site campground, and the Brigadoon Restaurant and Tavern, a popular banquet hall.  Metropolitan Toronto Park & Culture then leased the restaurant to a management group. However, the premises were destroyed by fire on December 28, 1980.  In May 1981, Metro reopened the facility as Glen Rouge Campground, named after its location in a steeply-sloped river valley, or glen, of the Rouge watershed.
<P>
The former Rouge Valley Ski Centre, at Twyn Rivers Drive and the Little Rouge River, was acquired in January 1970.  The Olympic Inn, a year-round resort with recreation facilities such as swimming and skiing, operated until the late 1960's until it was destroyed by fire.  In September 1970, the ski facilities reopened as the Caper Valley Skiways, but the venture proved unprofitable.  The ski-hills re-opened for the 1978 season under new management as the Rouge Valley Ski Centre.  Again, after two dismal seasons the ski centre failed and was closed for the last time.
<P>
During the 1980's, the Rouge Valley emerged as a public focus for the protection of diminishing natural heritage.  Lands owned by the Federal Government, the Province of Ontario and others were combined to form a continuous watershed park, eventually extending from Lake Ontario to the tributary headwaters at the Oak Ridges Moraine.  Planning for this park, guided by the Rouge Valley Management Plan (published 1994), will encompass natural and cultural heritage objectives, education, interpretation and recreation opportunities, while protecting and fostering the diverse ecological resources found here.

Guildwood Park, located on the edge of the Scarborough Bluffs, has a unique and interesting history. 
<P>
The property has been owned by a number of important people including Alexander MacDonnell of the Butler's Rangers and Speaker of the House in 1804; the Hon. Duncan Cameron, Provincial Secretary and Registrar of Upper Canada; and John Ewart, a Crown Commissioner whose daughter married Sir Oliver Mowat, Premier of Ontario.  A cabin constructed in 1795 still stands on the Guild Inn property. General Harold Bickford built the central building in 1914.  As World War I was reaching a conclusion in 1919 he commanded the Canadian Force which landed at Vladivostok.

Spencer and Rosa Clark purchased the 36-hectare estate in 1932 and established the "Guild of all Arts", a rent-free colony for more than one hundred craftsmen and their families.  Extensive facilities allowed artisans and apprentices to work in a number of mediums from sculpture to painting to ceramics.  The Clarks were avid supporters of the arts and collected over seventy architectural ornaments and artifacts in addition to one hundred and sixty sculptures.  Many of these pieces are still displayed throughout the site. 
<P>
While many of the artisans and craftsmen were fighting overseas during World War II, the Guild Inn facilities became part of the war effort at home.  Fifty Wrens (Womens Royal Navy Service) stayed during the winter of 1942-1943.  For the next four years the Inn was a military hospital for soldiers suffering nervous disorders.  The Clarks purchased an additional five hundred acres to provide year-round recreational facilities after the war, most of which became the residential community of Guildwood Village after it was sold to developers in the 1950's. 
<P>
Historic Guild Inn is one of Metro's best kept secrets.  Known throughout the world, the Inn has been visited by many artists, celebrities, royalty, and national leaders.  In 1978, Metro Toronto and the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority acquired ninety acres of the Guildwood property including the Guild Inn and its formal gardens for $8.2 million.  The Inn is operated as a full-service family resort, restaurant and conference centre (please call 261-3331 for information and reservations).  Visitors can enjoy fountains, sculpture gardens decorated with interesting architectural remnants and a promenade leading to the Scarborough Bluffs, surrounded by the mature forest of Guildwood Park.

The Lower Highland Creek contains a rich heritage of wetlands framed by forested ravine slopes.  Much of the floodplain below Lawrence Avenue is known as Stephenson's Swamp.  Red Oak, Eastern Hemlock, White Pine and Sugar Maple trees dominate the hillsides while the moist soils of the floodplain support Crack Willow and pockets of Cattail marshes.

Home Smith Park is situated on the west bank of the Humber River, opposite Etienne Brul Park. It commemorates Home Smith's contribution to community development in the Humber Valley. Robert Home Smith was born in Stratford, Ontario on July 12, 1877, the son of a Manitoba Supreme Court judge. Although his interests lay in architecture, Home Smith's mother convinced him to study law. Unfortunately, a serious illness left him partially deaf, so he abandoned the legal profession to pursue activities less dependent on hearing. Home Smith had a strong interest in developing land and by 1906 had purchased over 1,200 hectares in the Humber Valley. He began development of the Old Mill or Kingsway subdivision in 1912. Houses were built individually by owners on planned, subdivided lots in communities surrounding the valley. The Kingsway and Old Mill neighbourhoods may have been the first planned, fully serviced subdivisions in Toronto. Besides developing land, Home Smith also built the Old Mill Tea Rooms, constructed an electric train service along Annette Street, and designated land for commercial and recreational uses. 
<P>
The Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority acquired the land as part of the Watershed Conservation Scheme before transferring management responsibilities to Metropolitan Toronto.  In 1994, the Boy Scouts of Canada planted over 4000 cedar and sugar maple tree seedlings in Home Smith Park.

Humber Valley Golf Course, located along the west bank of the Humber River in Rexdale, became the second public course to be operated by Metro Toronto after 40.9 hectares were acquired from the Summerlea Golf Club in December 1957.  Until the mid-1950's the name "Humber Valley Golf Course" referred to a semi-private golf course located on the west bank of the Humber River from the Humber Sewage Treatment Plant north to King's Mill Park. 

The new Humber Valley Golf Course opened in March 1958 at a total cost of $357,554 for acquisition and development.  In 1992, Metro Park & Culture completed a $1.25 million renovation of the course including the construction of many new tees and greens, fairway realignments and the installation of an automated irrigation system.  The revised par 70 course challenges golfers with its combination of links and valleyland holes, appealing to all ages and skill levels.  Accuracy is crucial -- especially on the final three holes.

At the mouth of the Mimico Creek are the two landspits of Humber Bay Park.  Mimico comes from the Indian word "Omineca" meaning home of the wild pigeons because huge flocks were known to have inhabited the area.  On April 27, 1813, Humber Bay sheltered fourteen American warships under the command of Brigadier Pike of Pike's Peak fame (a 4301M high mountain in Colorado); nearly two thousand soldiers were preparing to raid and set fire to the Parliament Building further east during the War of 1812.
<P>
Humber Bay Village was an early lakefront community with close commercial and recreational ties to the water.  The park maintains a recreational focus for residents and visitors established during the mid-1800's when a number of hotels were built including the Royal Oak Hotel operated by a Scot named Octavius L. Hicks, John Duck's Wimbledon House, and a hotel operated by the famed distance runner Charles Nurse. Boating and other watersports were enjoyed here during the hot summer months.  Town council meetings were often held in the Humber Bay hotels. 
<P>
Developed by the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority with 5.1 million cubic metres of lakefill, at a cost of $6.56 million, Humber Bay Park was opened by Lieutenant-Governor John Black Aird on June 11, 1984.  Several habitat restoration projects have been initiated at Humber Bay Park including the planting of Carolinian trees and shrubs, the establishment of wildflower meadows and the creation of a warm-water fish habitat and wetland on the east peninsula.

Humber Arboretum is managed by the Humber College of Applied Arts and Technology, Metropolitan Toronto Park & Culture Department, Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, and the City of Etobicoke.  Fundraising efforts and development began in 1977 following an agreement between these four parties.  The first phase opened in the fall of 1982. Situated in the West Humber River valley, the Arboretum offers a balance of managed and natural areas, featuring a wide variety of plants and wildlife; it is a pleasant educational experience for visitors of all ages.  Several kilometres of self-guided hiking trails connect the various areas of the Arboretum, providing a wonderful way to experience nature.  The grounds are open every day of the year.
<P>
The Nature Orientation Centre, designed as a focal point for the Arboretum, is an educational facility which contains an assortment of ever-changing displays and exhibits.  Visitors can also see much of the site from the Centre's circular wooden deck.  The Dunington Grubb Gardens, below the Centre, are the most intensively cultivated section at the Arboretum.  Howard B. Dunington Grubb founded Sheridan Nurseries in 1913.  He and his wife gained recognition for their significant contribution to horticulture in Canada. Financial support for the Gardens was initially provided by their foundation.  The Woodlot and Meadow Garden is a 10-hectare fringe Carolinian hardwood forest (containing ash, maple, beech, and ironwood trees) surrounding a naturalized meadow where over 5,000 plants, typical of species found in this environment, have been introduced.  A trail connecting the Dunington Grubb Gardens to the Demonstration Gardens further east supports an extensive collection of native woody plants.  Plant lists developed with the Ontario Forestry Association emphasize those species which are most suitable for the urban environment. The Demonstration Gardens, opened in 1986, offers the "do-it-yourself" gardener many new landscape design ideas, from innovative building materials to construction techniques; it has become a scenic backdrop for unique plantings intended to show visitors how limitless landscaping can be.

James Gardens, on the west bank of the Humber River, is known for its flower gardens, terraced stone pathways beside sparkling spring-fed pools and streams, and mature trees.  In 1908, wholesale fish merchant Fred T. James purchased some land from his wife's parents and later added a parcel bought from the Home Smith Company.  For the next forty years James carefully transformed his property into a picturesque garden where public visitors were always welcome.  Before their main home was built in 1927, James lived in the coach-house that still stands next door.  He operated a fish market where the circular parking lot is today.  The terraces and collection pools were built almost fifty years ago using Humber River slate and weeping tiles.
<P>
James Gardens was purchased by Metropolitan Toronto in 1955 from the James estate.  In 1964, Metro Council authorized the establishment of a wildflower preserve at the park's south end in co-operation with the Federation of Ontario Naturalists.  This has added another interesting dimension to the gardens.

King's Mill Park is located on the west bank of the Humber River.  It was the site of the King's Mill and Reserve, established by Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe in 1793 as Etobicoke's first industry.  In 1821, Thomas Fisher leased the King's Mill, just below the Old Mill site.  He built his home "Milton" across from the Old Mill thirteen years later.  Fisher operated the mill until 1835 when he sold it to his friend and associate William Gamble, then moved upstream to the Village of Lambton Mills.  Gamble expanded the property and mill operations considerably.  Unfortunately, the mill was burned beyond repair in 1847.  The ruins at the Old Mill are actually remnants of a structure built on the same site by Gamble after the 1847 fire using the same millstream and tailrace.
<P>
High water levels from Hurricane Hazel in 1954 caused severe damage in the Humber Valley.  To prevent similar disasters from
reoccurring, a program of public ownership of the floodplain began.  The Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority acquired land from various sources including the City of Toronto, the Township of Etobicoke, and other private sources before transferring management responsibilities to Metropolitan Toronto.

Lambton Woods takes its name from the Village of Lambton Mills, a major 19th century community at the crossing of the Humber River and Dundas Street West.  Originally the settlement was known as Cooper's Mill after William Cooper's Grist and Saw Mill, built in 1806 on the east bank of the river.  To commemorate a visit in 1838 by John George Lambton, first Earl of Durham, the name was changed to the "Village of Lambton Mills".  Cooper's Mill was rebuilt into the Lambton Mill.
<P>
By 1857, the Village of Lambton Mills contained about 500 people and began to identify the entire community at Dundas Street and the Humber River.  Earlier, the community on the west bank was
frequently referred to as Milton Mills, although Milton Mill (owned by Thomas Fisher) was further downstream in what is now Home Smith Park.  Lambton Mills was served by a church, school, and post office which received mail daily.  It became an important commercial centre that included stores, a variety of milling operations, taverns, and hotels.  Within ten years the population had declined to 250 people as steam-powered mills replaced the water-powered mill.  Although technological change was detrimental to the community, Lambton Mills continued well into the next century.

Moore Park Ravine follows Mud Creek, a small tributary of the Don River.  The Don Valley Pressed Brick Works, started by the Taylor family in 1891, was located just east of the ravine.  Although later sold and renamed, the factory continued to manufacture bricks and became one of Ontario's oldest and longest operating brickworks, finally closing its kilns in 1988.  At one time, water drawn from Mud Creek was used in the brick making process.  The Brickworks property is now owned by the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority with Metro Toronto assuming management responsibility.  A master plan study for this unique parkland area is presently underway.
<P>
The community of Moore Park is nestled in the isolation of Avoca Vale below Mount Pleasant Cemetery, west of Mud Creek and east of the Deer Park community.  John Thomas Moore owned the 100 hectare property and in 1889 began developing it as a subdivision for affluent Torontonians.  Approximately 1,500 people resided in Moore Park when it was annexed by the City of Toronto in November 1912.
<P>
Moore was born in 1844 in Markham, Ontario, and held many prominent positions in business and political circles.  A chartered accountant by profession, he was a principal in the Alberta Central Railway and its president in 1911, and vice-president of the Belt Line Railway, a commuter line which served the rapidly expanding suburbs north and west of the City of Toronto.  The Belt Line Railway was not particularly successful, and was eventually discontinued due to competition from the automobile and other transit systems such as Sir William McKenzie's Toronto Street Railway.  Moore was an alderman for St. Paul's Ward in the City of Toronto and later, while living in Red Deer for business reasons, was the first member elected for that riding to the Alberta Legislative Assembly.
<P>
The Moore Park Ravine is currently maintained and operated by Metro Park & Culture.  Mud Creek defines the boundary separating the City of Toronto and the Borough of East York.  Both municipalities still own small parcels of land here.  The ravine is well-known for its walking path and natural habitat areas, and is enjoyed by visitors throughout the year.

The park is named after Morningside Avenue, a reference to its eastern location in the City of Scarborough.  "Morningside" usually refers to the sunrise side of an area. 
<P>
The valley of the Highland Creek was at one point inhabited.  A housing shortage after World War II resulted in many small cottages being converted into year-round residences, especially in the "Willows" area (immediately north-east of Lawrence Avenue and Orton Park Road) and elsewhere in the Highland Creek Valley below Highway 401.  Large numbers of settlers greatly intensified problems in an area not well suited for year-round habitation.  Contaminated wells, evictions, and home demolition were contentious issues in the post-war period.  The steep slopes and flat floodplain of the creek valley further complicated living conditions in the area as residents and their cottages were regularly threatened by flash flooding.  The severe damage from Hurricane Hazel in 1954 strengthened the demand for public ownership of floodplain land to prevent further development.
<P>
Other significant events in the history of Morningside Park include a joint project between the Township of Scarborough and Metropolitan Toronto in 1960 to construct a temporary bridge which made feasible a 61-hectare addition to the park.  The Camp of the Crooked Creek, located at the forks of the Highland Creek, was operated by the Boy Scouts of Canada from 1936 to 1968.  Since 1958, as lands were acquired by the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, management responsibilities were transferred to Metropolitan Toronto.  Landscape naturalization in the Highland Creek has been assisted by the Boy Scouts of Canada who have planted over 5000 White Pine Trees in Mornigside Park in 1994.

Northwood Park is located in the valley of the Black Creek, a tributary of the Humber River.  It was created using valley land from the old Northwood Golf Club.  During the early 1800's the area was known as the District of Elia.  It was settled primarily by Pennsylvania Germans, of which the Samuel Snider family were the most prominent in the area bounded by Sheppard Avenue, Keele Street, Finch Avenue, and Jane Street. The Sniders arrived in 1806 and continued to acquire land until the early 1900's for farming and milling. 
<P>
The 57-hectare Northwood Golf Club was purchased in the late 1970's to develop housing.  The undevelopable valley lands were then donated to the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority.  In 1980, management responsibilities for the land were transferred to Metropolitan Toronto.  In 1991, a successional forest revegetation pilot project was conducted in Northwoods Park.  Specific areas were planted with softwood and hardwood seedlings to extend and redefine the forest edges in an effort to reduce soil erosion, improve ground water recharge and provide a healthier habitat for wildlife.

Raymore Park is situated on land owned by the Scarlett family until the mid-1850's.  John Scarlett, a prominent businessman in the Westmount and Humbermount area, operated a distillery and a number of mills.  In 1857, local businessman Rowland Burr announced a proposal to build a canal four metres deep and thirty-seven metres wide, with sixty-four double locks, to link Lake Ontario and Georgian Bay through Lake Simcoe.  The canal route followed the Humber River Valley and actually cut through Raymore Park. Costs were estimated to exceed $35 million.  Although the project was later advanced by various groups such as the Toronto and Georgian Bay Canal Company and the Georgian Bay Ship Canal and Power Aqueduct Company, it was never completed.
<P>
In 1954, Hurricane Hazel washed away houses along the eastern section of Raymore Drive, near the river's edge.  Thirty-six people lost their lives when fourteen homes were destroyed by the record high flood waters.  Metropolitan Toronto dedicated Raymore Park to the hurricane's victims and survivors after management
responsibilities for the land were transferred from the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority.  After the hurricane, the Authority instituted the Watershed Conservation Scheme which eliminated riverbank development to prevent the reoccurrence of another disaster.  
<P>
On October 1973, Metropolitan Toronto Council renamed the southern portion of Raymore Park up to Humber Creek as the Ukrainian Canadian Memorial Park.  A memorial cairn honours the many Canadians of Ukrainian descent who sacrificed their lives for the cause of freedom while serving in the Canadian Armed Forces.

Thomas McDonald West owned and operated J. & J. Taylor Limited, Toronto Safe Works.  West and his wife Emma purchased the 16.2 hectare Rumph farm overlooking the Scarborough Bluffs about 1904-1905 and later divided it between their four children, Rosetta, Joseph McDonald, William Needham, and Howard Thomas.  Many of the historic landscape improvements enjoyed today were initially undertaken by Rosetta's husband, Robert Watson McClain, and Joseph McDonald West. 
<P>
Rosetta McClain died in December 1940.  On January 20, 1959, Robert Watson McClain offered their property as parkland in memory of his wife to the City of Toronto.  The property was transferred from the City of Toronto to the Borough of Scarborough in 1976 and on March 1, 1977, these lands were conveyed to the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority.  The Authority had already acquired the J.M. and H.T. West properties west of the Robert Watson McClain land in May 1974.
<P>
Metropolitan Toronto maintains and operates this waterfront parkland.  In 1985, the Park & Culture Department commenced the planning and development of a unique, fully-accessible garden park.  A central water fountain was designed with disabled patrons in mind as its gently sloped splash basin allows anyone to touch the water cascading down the granite rock.  Furthermore, planters and gardens have been designed to allow people with disabilities to maintain the park, reinforcing Metro's role as an equal opportunity employer.

Rouge Beach Park is located at the mouth of the Rouge River.  Two distinct geographical features define this area: a marsh area on the north side of the entrance road and a white sand beach on Lake Ontario.  The Rouge river and its main tributary, Little Rouge Creek, flow through an area that remains largely undeveloped -- the watershed encompasses about 2,200 hectares within Metropolitan Toronto.  Red clay in the river's banks give the water a distinct colour as it flows towards Lake Ontario; early eighteenth century French explorers noted the water's colour and recorded it as Rivire Rouge on maps.
<P>
Various bands of the Five Nations Iroquoian confederation inhabited the area until they were displaced by the Mississauga Indians in the late 1700's.  Remnants of early settlement can be found throughout the Rouge valley.  The Seneca Indians, an Iroquoian band, were believed to have inhabited an area between the Rouge River and Frenchman's Bay in Pickering; their main village was called Ganatsekwyagon.  The river was known by natives as Katabokokonk, meaning river of easy entrance. 
<P>
European settlement was not prevalent until the Crown began providing large land grants to United Empire Loyalists who were fleeing the United States after the American Revolution.  Major John Smith received a grant in 1792 that extended four kilometres along the shoreline of Lake Ontario and included the mouth of the Rouge River.  Major Smith's huge tract of land stalled any further development in the area for many years.
<P>
William Berczy, founder of the Town of Markham, attempted to build a canal along the Rouge River and the Holland River to connect Lake Ontario with Lake Simcoe.  Although it was never completed, a one-ton boat could travel 24 kilometres upstream by July 1795.  A variation on the project was undertaken by Cecil White in the 1920's.  His ambitious plan to transform the Rouge marsh and beach area into the "Venice of North America" was designed by Italian architects and included bridges and canals modelled after those in Venice.  Although channels were dredged in the marsh and a bridge connecting Woodgrange Avenue with Westpoint Avenue was built, the project collapsed after the stock market crash in 1929.  High flood waters from Hurricane Hazel removed the remaining structures built by White but, to this day, the channels are still visible in the marsh area.

Joseph Rowntree was an early pioneer in the north Humber village of Thistletown.  Named after its local physician Dr. Thistle, the village was originally known as St. Andrew's.  In 1843, Rowntree built a sawmill on the east bank of the river just outside the village and, five years later, built a grist mill on the west bank.  His mills were known as the "Greenholme Mills" and operated until the end of the nineteenth century.
<P>
Rowntree Mills Park was created by Metropolitan Toronto Council in 1959 following the Watershed Conservation Scheme, a Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority program designed to acquire floodplain lands.  In June 1969, Metro acquired a 5.2 hectare parcel at the north-east corner of the park from the Finnish Society of Toronto.  The Society had used the site as a recreation centre with steam-baths, saunas, bandshell, and an outdoor track with sports fields.
<P>
One of Metro's largest parks, Rowntree Mills contains a variety of landscape features and plant communities.  These include mown grass areas, forested valley slopes, bottomland forests, meadows and wetlands.  Identifying, protecting and enhancing these natural resources is a significant responsibility in the management of Metro's regional parklands.  Recently, a landscape character assessment was conducted in Rowntree Mills Park to evaluate its overall environmental quality.  Park use and maintenance practices were also monitored.  Results from these studies, combined with discussions with various interest groups and the public, will help guide the department's planning for this and other regional parks.

The Scarborough Bluffs are a significant geological feature resulting from the accumulation of sedimentary deposits when the Wisconsin Glacier advanced and retreated approximately 12,000 years ago.  The scenic cliffs are formed by the natural processes of wind and water erosion from Lake Ontario. 
<P>
Elizabeth Simcoe, the wife of Upper Canada's first Lieutenant-Governor, originally named the bluffs on August 4, 1793.  After seeing the beautifully carved sandstone cliffs, she considered building a summer residence on top and naming it Scarborough--reminiscent of the Yorkshire town in England also known for its cliffs.  Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe renamed the township
Scarborough, as tribute to the Duke of York who had recently defeated the French at battle in Holland.  When surveyed in 1791 by Augustus Jones, the township was called Glasgow.  Eventually, the Simcoe summer residence was built at Castle Frank overlooking the Don River Valley. 
<P>
In 1920, the Scarborough Water Works System was constructed here.  As Scarborough grew in population, the capacity of the filtration plant and pumping station were expanded; by 1952, the filtration plant processed 14.0 million gallons of water per day.  Only the pumping station is still in use today, operated as part of
Metropolitan Toronto's water supply system.
<P>
In May 1960, the Borough of Scarborough transferred its Scarborough Bluff holdings to the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority.  Various parcels of land were combined as part of the Waterfront Plan, a program designed to promote public ownership along the bluffs as a means of curtailing further erosion.  Scarborough Heights Park is intended to be part of continuous strip of parkland along the bluffs that will include footpaths, picnic areas, and structures to allow people to descend to the lake.

In 1972, Metro Council approved a development program for the South Humber regional park system. Among its features was the Scarlett Woods Golf Course which opened on July 1, 1974 at a cost of $549,260.  Both the golf course and the adjacent Scarlett Mills Park take their name from John Scarlett, an Englishman who settled in the area, raised a family, and helped develop the Humber Valley during the early 19th century.
<P>
Scarlett Woods Golf Course is an executive-length par 62 course suitable for beginners and experts alike.  Save your best shot for our 17th signature hole" -- the elevated tee of this par 3 hole overlooks a pond, 140 yards away from a well-bunkered green.

Scarlett Mills Park is located on the west bank of the Humber River near Eglinton Avenue.  Numerous members of the Scarlett family were early settlers in the area north of Lambton Mills, and Scarlett Road actually traversed many of their homesteads.  John Scarlett owned a sawmill and distillery operation that was located on the west bank where Scarlett Road crosses the Humber River.  Most of Lambton Golf and Country Club is situated on John Scarlett's homestead. 
<P>
After Hurricane Hazel inflicted considerable damage to life and property in 1954, the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority implemented the Watershed Conservation Scheme.  Lands were acquired from a variety of sources including the Township of Etobicoke, a landfill site at Edenbridge Drive and Scarlett Road, and private landowners, before management responsibilities were transferred to Metropolitan Toronto.

Serena Gundy Park is located in the West Don River valley, north of Eglinton Avenue East.  It was named after the first wife of the late James H. Gundy, owner of a 20-hectare private estate and president of the large securities dealer Wood Gundy Limited.  The parkland was donated by the Gundy Estate in March 1960, on the understanding that $200,000 would be spent during a ten-year period on park improvements and that a suitable memorial, approved by the trustees of the estate, would be erected.  A bronze plaque built into the stone gates at the Broadway Avenue entrance honours this generous gift. 
<P>
In addition, the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority also acquired parkland from the Township of Leaside in September 1965, further expanding the Central Don regional park system.

The Humber River Valley was part of an early passage into Huronia used regularly by natives and European traders and settlers.  The Humber Trail, or the Toronto Carrying Place, actually followed the east bank of the river along what is now Riverside Drive.  After Yonge Street was constructed in 1796, the Humber River declined as a major route inland because overland travel aided by the horse, and later rail, was not restricted by low water levels or the availability of boats. 
<P>
A plaque honouring Etienne Brul stands in South Humber Park.  In 1615, he became the first European explorer to reach the mouth of the Humber River.  His likely vantage point was from the scenic lookout at Humber Marshes, a steep ridge at the beginning of the Humber Trail. 
<P>
South Humber Park is located on the west bank of the river across from the Humber Marshes, just north of the Humber Sewage Treatment Plant.  Metropolitan Toronto purchased the former Humber Valley Golf Course in the early 1950's, but did not dedicate the remaining land as open space until 1955.  One year earlier, the Humber Valley was severely damaged by Hurricane Hazel.  To prevent similar disasters from reoccurring, a program of public ownership of other lands in the floodplain was initiated. 
<P>
In 1994, the Humber Bridge, a 6.5-metres wide and 139-metres long structure spanning the mouth of the Humber River was built at a cost of $4.05 million.  This "landmark gateway" connects the Waterfront and Martin Goodman Trails along the Lake Ontario shoreline with the Tommy Thompson Trail through the Humber Valley.  Elements reflected in the bridge's design and surrounding landscape reacquaint visitors with the region's cultural history and geographic significance.  Funding for the Humber Bridge was made possible by a partnership between the Metro government, the Province of Ontario, the
Waterfront Regeneration Trust and the cities of Etobicoke and Toronto.

Sunnybrook Farm was the 154-hectare country estate of Joseph Kilgour acquired at the end of the nineteenth century.  It extended east from Bayview Avenue to Leslie Street above Glenvale Boulevard and encompassed the Burke Ravine, named after Edward and Jonas Burke, who settled here in the 1860's and 1870's.  The first Provincial Plowing Match was held on Sunnybrook Farm in 1913.  Many other Canadian Establishment homes abutted Sunnybrook Farm including the Vaughan family's "Donnington", the Gundy Estate, and the McLean family's 365-hectare "Donlands Farm" to the east.  After her husband's death in 1928, Mrs. Alice Kilgour gave a 71-hectare parcel to the City of Toronto for parkland in memory of her husband who was "a great lover of nature".  The Toronto Field Naturalists opened the first urban wilderness trail in Canada at Sunnybrook Park on June 7, 1930 -- this organization also operates a visitor information centre at the log cabin nearby the entrance gates.  The parkland was a favorite campground for Boy Scouts and, during the Second World War, was a transit camp for troops preparing to leave for Europe. 
<P>
In 1946, the Department of Veterans Affairs purchased the remaining land for $14 million to build Sunnybrook Veterans Hospital, opening it in September of the same year.  The Burke Ravine and the eastern portion of the property remained as parkland.  Sunnybrook Park officially opened by Metropolitan Toronto on June 12, 1969, after land was acquired from the City of Toronto and from the Estate of Alice Kilgour in December 1965.  Two conditions of the Estate were satisfied; in 1968, memorial gates were built at the south entrance of the park, and access from Bayview Avenue has been maintained.  In 1994, the Thomas H. Thomson Nature Trail was established -- native wildflowers, ferns, shrubs and trees were planted along a series of interpretive trails within a mature forest.  This long-term project will help to diversify species and  encourage natural regeneration within the forest, while providing an educational experience for park visitors.

The Cherry Orchard was the original name for Sylvan Park.  Its current name is derived from nearby Sylvan Avenue and refers to the wooded, rural character of the area.  In Roman mythology, Sylvanus was a woodland deity.  After 1961, the property was owned by Bracondale Investments Ltd., then sold to Harvard Developments Ltd. which attempted to develop housing on the property.  The Cherry Orchard was purchased in 1966 by Metropolitan Toronto and transferred to the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority.  It was included in the Waterfront Plan for Metropolitan Toronto, a program to promote public ownership along the bluffs as a means of curtailing further erosion.  Sylvan Park is intended to be part of a continuous strip of parkland along Scarborough Bluffs that will include footpaths, picnic areas, and structures to allow people to descend to the lake.  
<P>
The western boundary of Sylvan Park is adjacent to a steeply-sloped ravine which cuts through the Scarborough Bluffs on its way to the lake.  This ravine is named after a well-known pioneer, Johnathan Gates.  Gates settled here about 1815 and later operated the Scarboro Inn, also known as Gates Tavern, at Kingston Road, just east of Bellamy Road.  In 1993, Metropolitan Toronto formally named this ravine Gates' Gulley.

In 1973, Metropolitan Council approved the acquisition of 48.030 hectares of the former Tam O'Shanter Country Club by the
Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority for use as a public park. Acquisition costs of $10,825,000 were shared by the Province of Ontario (40%), Metro Toronto (38%), and the then Borough of Scarborough (22%).  A 5.677-hectare parcel at the southeast corner is leased to the City of Scarborough for local park purposes.  Tam O'Shanter Golf Course occupies the remaining 42.353 hectares. 

The Metro Park & Culture began a comprehensive, $1.17 million redevelopment at the golf course in 1980.  Improvements at Tam O'Shanter included a new clubhouse, automated irrigation system, and a revised course layout.  Although the number of golfers has increased dramatically in Metro Toronto in recent years, fewer courses remain available for play.  Since 1967, many courses including York Downs, Rouge Hills, Morningside, DeHavilland, Forest Hills, Sunrise, Northwoods and West Hill have ceased operating and their lands were sold, usually for redevelopment.  Public golf courses have greatly increased in popularity as a result of these losses.

Taylor Creek Park follows a major tributary to the Forks of the Don River.  Three rivers meet at the forks and form the Lower Don River: the East Don, the West Don and this tributary.  Known by several names over the years, the two most commonly used names -- Taylor and Massey Creek -- are taken from two families with important historical ties to the area.  A third name, Silver Creek, was used during the early 1800's. 
<P>
Although not the first millers in the area, brothers John Jr., Thomas, and George Taylor moved here from Vaughan in 1834 to establish saw and paper mills.  By 1851, the Taylors owned a water-powered saw mill.  Three years later, the York Paper Mill was purchased from John Eastwood and Colin Skinner and later, a third mill, John Taylor and Brothers Paper Manufacturers, was added on the West Don River near the present North York border.  The mills were extremely productive and employed 100 people by the 1900's.  The Taylor lands extended from the river forks nearly a mile north of Eglinton Avenue, on both sides of Don Mills Road with more parcels in the Todmorden Mills area. 
<P>
The tributary's current name, Massey Creek, refers to 1897 when Walter Massey purchased about 100 hectares of land from Dawes Road to Pharmacy Avenue.  He named the estate Dentonia Farms after his wife, Susan Marie Denton, and produced milk here to help combat typhoid fever among Toronto children.  In 1901, Walter Massey died after contracting the disease but his wife continued to operate the City Dairy Company until the 1930's.  She built an enormous 100 room house which was given to the Crescent School for boys in 1933.  Dentonia Park Golf Course is situated on part of the old estate. 
<P>
A Canadian Northern Ontario Railway line ran along the southern slope of the valley after 1913 until it was sold in 1925 to the Canadian National Railway.  
<P>
In 1959, the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority began acquisition of these lands before transferring management responsibilities to Metropolitan Toronto.  The Park & Culture Department has undertaken many projects in the Massey Creek valley including pathways, bridges and landscape restoration.  In 1994, the Boy Scouts of Canada planted over 5000 spruce and pine seedlings in Taylor Creek Park.  
<P>
Next to Taylor Creek Park is the Charles Sauriol Conservation Reserve, which follows the East Don river valley from the Forks to Eglinton Avenue East.  Established in 1991, the reserve recognizes the efforts of Charles Sauriol, a popular author, long-time local resident and devoted naturalist who has sought to protect the Don Valley for many years.  His books "Remembering The Don" (1981), "Tales of the Don" (1984) and "Trails of the Don" (1992) and numerous articles have entertained readers with first-hand accounts of a lifetime spent in the valley.  For many years, Charles Sauriol's home was actually located near the southern entrance to the reserve.

The expansive Thistletown Area parklands are located at the junction of three major tributaries of the Humber River -- the West Humber River, Emery Creek, and the North Humber River.  The park receives its name from the village which was planned for John Grubb in 1847 around the intersection of Albion Road and Islington Avenue.  The property was part of John Grubb's farmlands.  Grubb was a promoter of the Albion and the Weston plank toll road companies, an elected member of the Home District Council and a magistrate.  Although originally known as St. Andrew's, Thistletown was renamed in honour of Dr. William Thistle, the local physician.

Since 1959, the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority has been gradually acquiring parkland here following the inception of the Watershed Conservation Scheme, a floodplain acquisition and management program.  In 1992, Metro Park & Culture initiated a $3.26 million parkland development program for the North Humber Region, including Rowntree Mills and Thackeray Park just further north.  This program will result in a fully integrated trail system connecting West Humber Parkland and Humber Arboretum to the parklands along the North Humber River.  
<P>
In the Thistletown area, the plan includes the construction of a pedestrian/ bicycle trail with several river crossings and landscape naturalization plantings.  By 1997, the trail will follow the West Humber River from Albion Road before reaching the North Humber River, cross Emery Creek, and branch west to Islington Avenue and east to Weston Road.  In June 1992, the provincial Ministry of Tourism and Recreation's Fresh Approach Community Recreation program contributed an additional $208,833.00 to this project.  To encourage habitat regeneration along the riparian zone, or river edges, native species such as Red Twig Dogwood, Pussy Willow, Saskatoon Berry, and Witch Hazel have been planted alongside the trail construction as it makes its way north to Rowntree Mills Park.

Todmorden Mills Park, located on what was once a gentle meander of the Don River, was one of the first areas to be settled in the valley.  In 1794, Isaiah and Aaron Skinner were granted 81 hectares of land by Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe to operate a saw mill, and the following year a grist mill license was also obtained.  Parshall Terry, the Skinners' brother-in-law, purchased the mills around 1798 but drowned ten years later.  His son operated the mills until his death during the War of 1812.  Two settlers from Yorkshire, John Eastwood and Thomas Helliwell Sr., purchased the property in 1821.  The settlement became known as Todmorden Mills, a reference to Helliwell's home town in England.  Helliwell built a brewery and distillery and, in 1825, Eastwood and Colin Skinner began the York Paper Mill.  Their paper mill was built with a distinguished, tall brick chimney to replace the grist mill.  After Helliwell's death, his sons continued to operate the brewery until 1847 when it was destroyed by a fire that also claimed the original Helliwell homestead.  In 1854, Todmorden Mills was purchased by the Taylor family, who by 1891 also operated the Don Valley Pressed Brick Works across the river.  The mill produced paper until the end of the century when the building was damaged by fire. 
<P>
During the early 1900's, Todmorden Mills underwent a lengthy series of ownership changes.  After serious damage from the flood waters of Hurricane Hazel in 1954, the property was acquired by Metropolitan Toronto.  In order to obtain additional land for construction of the Don Valley Parkway in 1958, the river was diverted west by cutting off the meander.  Unfortunately, this separated Todmorden Mills from its traditional water supply.  
<P>
In October 1964, Metropolitan Toronto Council, the Borough of East York and the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority entered into a three-party agreement whereby the historic buildings would be restored by the Borough as a Centennial project.  Todmorden Mills is now home to the East York Historical Society and the Todmorden Mills Museum where daily tours and frequent seminars are held.

<A NAME="about"><H3>About the Toronto Islands</H3></A>

The Toronto Islands were not always islands but actually a series of continuously moving sand-bars, or littoral drift deposits, originating from the Scarborough Bluffs and carried westward by Lake Ontario currents.  By the early 1800's the longest of these bars extended nearly 9 kilometres south-west from Woodbine Avenue, through Ashbridge's Bay and the marshes of the lower Don River, forming a natural harbour between the lake and the mainland. 
<P>
Visitors to the Toronto Islands have enjoyed their lakeside charm for centuries.  Although the peninsula and surrounding sand-bars were first surveyed in 1792 by Lieutenant Bouchette of the British Navy, they were well-known by native people.  Indian lore described them as a place of leisure and relaxation.  The main peninsula became known to European settlers as the "Island of Hiawatha". D.W. Smith's Gazetteer recorded in 1813 that "the long beach or peninsula, which affords a most delightful ride, is considered so healthy by the Indians that they resort to it whenever indisposed".  Many Indian encampments were located between the peninsula's base and the Don River.  The sand-bars were also important to birds and other wildlife.  During migration periods vast numbers of birds frequently stopped at the sand-bars and marshlands of the Don River and Ashbridge's Bay. 
<P>
A carriage path from York which led to Gibraltar Point at the western tip of the peninsula, and also followed the shoreline east to Scarborough Bluffs, was very popular during the early 1800's.  It later became known as Lake Shore Avenue.  Part of the boardwalk on Centre Island traces this same route.  A bridge across the Don River that was constructed to enable people from the city to reach Lake Shore Avenue also aided settlement east of the river.  In 1850, the young engineer Sanford Fleming studied the sand-bar movement and calculated that twelve hectares of area had been added to the western section of the sand-bars over the previous fifty years.  During that decade, a number of severe storms and their strong wave action worked to erode the peninsula, requiring frequent repair to small gaps until finally, in 1858, an island was created when a storm completely separated the peninsula from the mainland and the gap was not repaired.  The Eastern Gap has since become an important shipping route into the Toronto Harbour.
<P>
Dredging projects have been undertaken to stabilize shorelines, reduce sand-bar movement, create deeper boating channels, or raise land levels generally.  During 1904-6, a channel was cut north of the Island Filtration Plant, alongside Hiawatha Avenue.  In 1909, Long Pond was dredged to replace the regatta course previously located at Hanlan's Point.  The resulting material was used to enlarge Mugg's Island.  Similar projects created Olympic Island.  High lake levels continually damaged island properties and on January 1, 1956, the City of Toronto transferred the islands to Metropolitan Toronto to be developed as a regional park. Over 1,225,000 people visit this 230.388 hectare park each year.

<H2><A NAME="hanlan">Hanlan's Point</A></H2>

The Hanlan family was among the first year-round inhabitants on Toronto Island, settling at Gibraltar Point in 1862.  After the islands were transferred from the federal government to the City of Toronto in 1867, Plan D-141 divided the land into lots and allowed cottages, amusement areas and resort hotels to be built.  The west side of the island, commonly known as West Point, rapidly became a resort destination for the citizens of Toronto; the first summer cottage community was found here.  In 1878, a hotel was built by John Hanlan at the north-west tip of the island and soon after the area became known as Hanlan's Point.  Edward "Ned" Hanlan, probably the most famous member of the family, earned international recognition as a rower and held numerous world records.  By the 1890's three hotels and a summer recreation centre had been built. 
<P>
In 1894, an ambitious lakefill project by the Toronto Ferry Company added space for an amusement park that included an exciting roller-coaster called the Big Scream.  A baseball stadium, built in 1909 and destroyed by fire one year later, was rebuilt to hold 10,000 spectators.  Babe Ruth, a baseball legend, hit his first professional home run here.  The role of Hanlan's Point as a centre of recreation declined after the 1930's when the stadium was closed and the Maple Leaf baseball team moved to a new facility at the foot of Bathurst Street.  The amusement park was demolished and in 1937 Toronto Island Airport was constructed.

<A NAME="centre"><H2>Centre Island</H2></A>
<P>
Centre Island is located between Hanlan's Point and Ward's Island.  A carriage route along the peninsula connecting the mainland to Gibraltar Point Lighthouse later evolved into Lake Shore Avenue, the main east-west axis along Centre Island.  By the late 1800's, many of Toronto's wealthiest families built beautiful Victorian summer homes along Lake Shore Avenue, east from Manitou Road to Ward's Island.  In 1884, construction of an Anglican church, St. Andrew-by-the-Lake, was directed by Archbishop Sweatman.  Four years later Island Park was established on land previously occupied by the Mead Hotel, and has continued to offer an impressive panoramic view of downtown Toronto ever since.  Two distinctive bridges, still in use  today, were built to accommodate the increase in traffic along the  central north-south axis as the Centre Island Ferry, operated by the  Toronto Ferry Company, became more popular.  The Manitou Road bridge (1912) replaced an old wooden bridge and the Olympic Island bridge (1914) was built to link Olympic Island with Island Park.  Manitou  Road, the main commercial thoroughfare at Toronto Island from the  1890's to the 1930's still remains but comerce has been replaced by the Avenue of the Islands garden promenade which leads to a pier projecting almost 150 metres into Lake Ontario.
<P>
Ward's Island, actually the east section of the old peninsula, was named after the Ward family who first settled here about 1830.  David Ward, a local fisherman, raised seven children.  His son, William, built the landmark Ward's Hotel in 1882, just south of the ferry docks at Channel Avenue. Originally the building had two floors and a central, third story tower, but in 1922 the tower and upper floor were removed after the structure deteriorated.  The remaining building operated as a grocery supply and ice-cream parlour until its demolition in 1966.  The hotel, in addition to Wiman's Baths, built in 1881, created a pleasant resort that attracted many visitors.
<P>
On January 1, 1956, Metropolitan Toronto received the Toronto Islands from the City of Toronto for development as a regional park.  Many projects have been undertaken by the Park & Culture Department including fully accessible washrooms, a public marina, an amusement area and petting zoo, and the establishment of naturalized areas and wildlife reserves.

The thickly forested valley following Massey Creek east of Pharmacy Avenue to St. Clair Avenue is known as Warden Woods.  It is believed the name, originally spelled Wardin, referred to a warden for the Township of York who lived in the area.  Although a surveyed road that separated lots 32 and 33 existed here before the 1840's, it was named considerably later.  The 1910 Goad's Atlas records the road as Wardin Avenue. 
<P>
The valley's contour has been shaped by the erosion of Massey Creek through the Halton glacial till plain (Toronto's last glacial deposit) and through several underlying glacial deposits.  The shoreline of glacial Lake Iroquois intersects Massey Creek near Byng Park (see map).  About 12,000 years ago, Massey Creek actually into fed a sheltered bay that had formed behind a large south-west projecting sand spit -- an early forerunner of the Toronto Island.
<P>
The Lake Iroquois shoreline is an easily detected landscape feature.  When the last glaciers retreated from Toronto, between 13,000 and 14,000 years ago, deep layers of till, silt and clay were left behind.  This material, picked up and carried by the glaciers as they advanced towards the United States, was deposited directly onto the ground by the melting ice or into temporary glacial lakes.  Enormously heavy, the continent-wide ice sheet also depressed the land below its present level.  Water levels rose significantly when meltwater from the glaciers became trapped by the ice-blocked St. Lawrence outlet, creating Lake Iroquois -- the shoreline remains visible as the steep hill passing on an east-west course across the lower part of Metro Toronto and beyond.  As the glaciers retreated, land levels rose gradually, water drained through the St. Lawrence river valley and the shoreline receded to its present location some 8000 years ago.
 
The influence of these natural elements on the landscape of Warden Woods is quite apparent.  Wet swells run from the valley slopes, gently guided through clay deposits or seeps.  The sheltered valley and its mixed topography, fertile soils and areas of varied drainage provide rich conditions that support a diversity of plant and wildlife species.  Plant communities include red oak and sugar maple forests, old field and cattail seeps.  At least 178 different vascular plants have been found here including 123 native species. 
<P>
Warden Woods was acquired from the Sisters of St. Joseph by the Township of Scarborough in January 1959.  Since March 1965, Warden Woods has been maintained as part of Metro's regional parks.

A diversity of wooded areas and open spaces can be found along the banks of the West Humber River.  In July 1986, the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority consolidated valleyland from Humber Arboretum (at Highway 27) to Albion Road before transferring management responsibilities to Metropolitan Toronto.  The Park & Culture Department began a phased development program proceeded later that year which included a paved parking lot, pathways, and a comfort station designed for year-round use.  In January 1989, a new bridge spanning forty metres was installed west of Martin Grove Road, linking both sides of the valley for park visitors.  Cycling, jogging, and strolling are popular activities throughout the West Humber parkland.
<P>
The valley has also been the location for reforestation and wildflower plantings.  The Boy Scouts of Canada have undertaken a significant reforestation program in the valley east of Highway 27.  About 8,000 coniferous seedlings were planted south of Etobicoke General Hospital in the spring of 1990, with more plantings to follow.  Scouts Canada also assisted with an experimental wildflower planting during the summer of 1990. Results from these projects will help the Park & Culture Department to develop new techniques using various types of plant life to encourage successful landscape regeneration and beautification.

Alexander Milne first settled the northern end of the valley now known as Wilket Creek after the War of 1812.  From this period until the 1950's it was known as Milne Creek.  The name Wilket Creek originally referred to a tributary of the East Don River nearly three miles further north.  The park was developed by Metropolitan Toronto in 1960 to provide a suitable link between Edwards Gardens (originally the Milne settlement) and Serena Gundy Park.  
<P>
Wilket Creek Park is well-known for its mature coniferous and deciduous forest communities.  Depending on soil moisture, light, and orientation of the ravine slopes, mature stands of Eastern Hemlock, Sugar Maple, American Beech, Red Oak and Hop Hornbeam thrive along the valley walls.  Moist marshes and groundwater seeps that flow towards the creek provide the dampness needed by the ferns, cattail marshes and wet scrub communities along the
floodplain.  A diversity of species may be found within the valley including such rare plants as Canada Sicklepod, Snakerood, and New York Fern.  Some uncommon bird species have also visited here as a stop-off point during seasonal migrations.  This narrow, winding ravine has also benefitted from a number of wildflower plantings and natural regeneration projects conducted by Metro Parks and Culture.

York Mills was one of the earliest communities in Metropolitan Toronto.  It developed around the many mills located along a stretch of the West Don River at Yonge Street.  The community has been known by various other names including Big Creek Bridge (from 1797 to 1809), Heron's Bridge (to 1822), Millford Mills (to 1824), and York Mills after the 1836 opening of a post office.  Since 1850, Hogg's Hollow has also been used but it originally referred to a sub-division of the family property by the Hogg brothers.  York Mills also prospered due to its proximity to Yonge Street, the main route north from Toronto.  A radial rail line passed through York Mills to connect with points north of Toronto, further emphasizing the role location had on the town's development.

York Mills Park consists of floodplain lands acquired from public and private sources.  Hurricane Hazel inflicted considerable damage to the area in 1954, so a program of river channelization to improve drainage flow and control riverbank erosion was required.  In August 1957, land expropriated by the Township of North York was purchased by Metropolitan Toronto.  Additional lands were acquired in 1958 from the City of Toronto, the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority and private sources.

Tommy Thompson Park, on the Toronto waterfront, is a significant stopover for migratory birds and a favourite spot for visitors to enjoy cycling, jogging, fishing, walking and photography.  The park is located on a constructed peninsula known as the Leslie Street Spit.  Since construction is still underway, the park is open weekends and holidays only.
<p>
In the summer, a naturalist leads theme walks for the public on holiday weekends.  From spring to fall a shuttle van is available for visitors at half-hour intervals from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.  Call for additional information.

<center><h1>Building a Hot Compost Pile</h1></center>
     Hot piles are useful for composting food wastes with yard wastes (without pest problems), for killing soil diseases and weed seeds, and for producing compost in a short period of time.  Here are step-by-step instructions to make a hot compost pile.
<OL>
<LI>Gather all material needed to make a pile that is at least 1 cubic metre (3 cubic feet) in diameter.  Use equal volumes of both green (nitrogen-based) and brown (carbon-based) materials.
<LI>Run materials through a shredder or chop them in a garbage can with a "weed trimmer" to increase the surface area.  Leaves may be run over with a lawnmower to break them down.
<LI>Start building the pile with a 10-15 cm (4-6 inch) base of brown (carbon-based), coarse material such as small branches, cornstalks.  This bottom layer will increase airflow in the pile.
<LI>Next, add a 10-15 cm (4-6 inch) layer of nitrogen-rich materials.  Kitchen waste (avoid meat and dairy products as well as fats and oil) is an excellent source of nitrogen.
<LI>Place a 2.5 cm (1 inch) layer of browns (soil, finished compost or dried leaves) on top of nitrogen layer.
<LI>Continue alternating and mixing layers of green and brown materials and add water if necessary, until the pile is 1 metre (3 to 4 feet) high.
<LI>Close the bin or cover the pile and wait.  Monitor the temperature in the interior of the pile on a regular basis. The temperature should reach between 50-70 C (120-160 F) in approximately 4-7 days.
<LI>When the temperature begins to decrease, turn the pile.  Take materials from the outer edges and top of the pile and place them at the base and middle of the new  pile.  Those from the middle should be on the outside edges and top of the new pile.
<LI>Continue monitoring the temperature in the pile.
<LI>Approximately one week later, the temperature should peak. At this point, turn the pile again.  After another week, the compost should be finished.</UL><P>
     Note:     The composting process will still happen even if you don't follow all the steps mentioned above.  However, to speed up the process water are extremely important.<P>

<center><h1>The Value of Compost</h1></center>

<H2>What is compost?</H2>
Compost is considered a soil conditioner rather than a fertilizer and contains a good range of major and minor plant nutrients, plus trace elements essential for healthy plant growth.  Unlike chemical fertilizers, compost has a built-in time release mechanism, which chemical fertilizer manufacturers try to duplicate.
<HR>
<H2>What are the benefits of using compost?</H2>
Compost returns organic matter to the soil in a usable form.  This improves plant growth by:
<UL>
<LI>loosening up heavy clay soils so that air and water may get in
<LI>helping sandy soils to retain water and nutrients
<LI>adding essential nutrients and soil organisms to all soil
<LI>killing plant diseases and harmful organisms
</UL>
<HR>
<H2>How is compost used?</H2>
Compost can be used:
<UL>
<LI>in the flower and vegetable garden or on the soil around trees and shrubs
<LI>for house plants and planter boxes (after baking in a conventional oven at 82 degrees C/180 degrees F for one hour)
<LI>as part of a seed-starting mix
<LI>on the lawn as a top-dressing (when screened)
<LI>for making compost tea.  (Please see below.)
</UL>
<HR>
<H2>When is the best time to use compost?</H2>
The best time to dig compost into a garden is when preparing the bed for planting, in the spring or fall.  Used in this way, compost is called a soil amendment.  If only a small amount of compost is available, it can be spread in seed furrows, or added to each transplant hole.  Compost is an excellent "top dressing" and can be placed on the soil around flower and vegetable plants, shrubs and trees.
<HR>
<H2>Making compost tea</H2>
     One way to make use of your finished compost is to make compost tea.  Place the compost in a burlap bag and insert it in a barrel of water.  Let it steep for a week.  Gently stir the water everyday.<P>
When your tea has steeped to a strong tea colour, squeeze the burlap bag to extract all the moisture.  Stir the tea in order to incorporate the sludge with the tea.  Place the leftover compost on the garden as a mulch or add it back to your compost pile.<P>
Use the tea to water your garden or your plants, or use it as a nutritious spray for the leaves of all of your plants.<P>
<Blockquote><H3>Materials</H3>
<UL>
<LI>burlap bag, onion bag or old pillowcase
<LI>plastic drum
<LI>tap
<LI>silicone sealer
<LI>screen mesh
<LI>concrete blocks (optional)
</UL>
<BR>
<H3>Procedure</H3>
Place a tap at the bottom of the drum.  Seal it with silicone and glue wire mesh over the tap opening inside the drum.  You may add a lid if you wish.<P>

<H3>Variation<P></H3>
On a smaller scale, you can fill a watering can half and half with water and compost and let it steep until the compost tea is ready.<P></Blockquote>

<center><h1>Controling Odour</h1></center>

Composting is a great way to reduce your household waste by up to one-third, while        producing a rich soil conditioner for your garden, lawn and house plants.  For those who have never tried to compost, or are just beginning, odour is a common concern.  A hot and healthy compost pile will not create offensive odours.  To prevent odours from developing, there are a   few simple things to remember.

<HR><H2>1. Do not add large, unchopped items to the pile.</h2>

	Compostable items that are about one inch or smaller in size will break down very quickly, as they offer more surface area for the decomposer organisms to work on.  Large items that 			are not chopped into smaller pieces may decompose more slowly.

<HR><H2>2.	Make sure each layer of material is no more than 10-15 cm (4 to 6 inches) thick.</h2>

	Do not add large amounts of only one material.  When adding food waste to the top of the pile, bury it in the centre and cover with a one-inch layer of soil.  Always keeping a layer of soil on top of your pile will trap any mild odours that may occur.


<HR><H2>3.	Keep the whole pile as damp as a well-wrung sponge.</h2>

	The proper amount of moisture in the pile is very important in the control of odour.  Too much moisture can create a rotten egg smell.  


<HR><H2>4.	Never add meat, bones, dairy products, fats or oils to your compost pile.</h2>  These materials will smell as they decompose and may also attract unwanted insect and animal pests.


<HR><H2>5.	Make sure there is a lot of air in the pile.</h2>

	A compost pile that does not have enough air is called anaerobic.  To prevent an anaerobic compost pile, poke holes through it with a broom or rake handle, a stick or a commercial aerating tool, or turn it with a garden fork.<P>
You can also create a chimney that will regularly allow air into your pile.  Place a bundle of sticks, about 15 cm (6 inches) in diameter (tied with rope), or a piece of weeping tile punctured with small air holes, in the centre of your compost pile.
<HR>
<H2>Common Odours</H2>


<B>Ammonia:</B> An ammonia smell means that too much nitrogen-rich material has been added to the pile.  Materials that are high in nitrogen content include kitchen food waste and green grass clippings.  These are called green materials and they must be 	balanced with carbon-rich or brown materials to properly decompose in a com	post pile.  Materials high in carbon include brown leaves, dried grass clippings, dried garden plants and straw.<P>

			Always add equal amounts by volume of green and brown materials.  Turn and mix the materials in the compost pile; dampen to the wetness of a well-wrung sponge; and top with a 2.5 cm (1 inch) layer of soil.  The soil will trap any remaining ammonia and turn it back into nitrogen.<P>

<B>Rotten Egg:</B>	Compost piles that are too wet, or too compacted, will become anaerobic and give off a rotten egg smell.  To solve this problem, turn the pile with a garden fork or shovel to allow more air into the pile.  Mix in dry leaves or a similar dry material to absorb moisture. Repeat this step for a few days.  Then place a 2.5 cm(1 inch) layer of soil on top of the pile to introduce more decomposer organisms to the pile and reduce the odour.<P>

While anaerobic composting is the process used in some commercial composting units, the pile will smell during the decomposition process as the bacteria produced in the pile give off a foul-smelling gas.  The finished product from an anaerobic composter may also smell.

<center><h1>Community Composting</h1></center>

     Residents living in apartments, co-ops and condominiums across Metro Toronto are discovering that composting doesn't require a house with a large backyard.  What is required is green space, clear information, good leadership and a strong team effort.<P>
By participating in the Metro Toronto Community Composting Program, you can attend a free workshop where you'll learn how to set up a program in your community, the basic how-to's of composting and many good problem-solving techniques.  Your group will also be eligible to purchase a multi-bin composting unit from Metro Works for a greatly subsidized price.  To get your group started, just follow the steps listed below.
<HR>
<H2>Obtain clear information.</H2>
Come to a Community Composting workshop offered by Metro Works where you'll learn about composting from Metro's composting experts.  Take advantage of our free information materials.  These include a how-to booklet called "Be Good to Your Garden  - Compost!" (also available in French, Italian, Chinese, Spanish and Portuguese), factsheets on composting, and a video entitled "The Magic of Composting" available for free rental.
<HR>
<H2>Build a compost committee.</H2>
To get other residents involved, start generating some interest.  Post notices throughout your building to make others aware of your project, then call a meeting to discuss your plans.  Use Metro's composting video and information sheets to educate others about composting.  While all tenants who are interested in composting can participate, you will need some special help.  Ask for volunteers to join your compost committee.
<HR>
<H2>Locate the green space.</H2>
Check with your building superintendent or property manager to determine if there is a space available for use as a composting site.  You will need a level area with good drainage.  The amount of space you require will be determined by the type of composting bin(s) you choose for your program.
<HR>
<H2>Do some research.</H2>
Try to measure the total volume of waste produced by the residents in your building.  Remember that about 30% of this will be compostable.  Then meet with your building landlords, property managers, appropriate committees and maintenance staff to discuss setting up your composting program.  By working together you can create community composting systems to custom fit your building's needs.
<HR>
<H2>Education is the key.</H2>
When you're ready to begin, call all residents together to explain what the program is about and how it will work.  Show them where the bins are located and how to use them.  After the program begins, make sure you keep in touch with the participants through notices on bulletin boards, regular meetings and problem-solving sessions.
<HR>
<H2>Now you're composting!</H2>
A community composting program may sound like a lot of work and responsibility, but if your community is motivated and you stay organized, your project will be a success.  Don't forget, we're a part of your community as well.  We can answer your questions, give presentations and provide you with free informational materials.

<center><h1>Metro's Approach To Composting</h1></center>

     The value of composting has been recognized by gardeners for centuries.  But this simple process of turning food and yard waste into a nutrient-rich soil conditioner also means less waste going to landfill.  In order to promote the benefits of composting, Metro Works has undertaken a number of successful programs which are described below.
<HR>
<H2>Home composting program</H2>
By far the most successful composting program has been the sale of backyard composting bins for a subsidized price.  Over 120,000 units have been sold so far for just $15.00 each. Residents are offered a selection of bins to choose from - aerobic backyard units, vermicomposters (worm bins), apartment and balcony units and other specialty units for yard waste materials.  For more information on how to obtain a composter, call the Composter Order Line at (416)392-9573.
<HR>
<H2>Community composting</H2>
Composting is gaining popularity among apartment, condominium and co-op residents.  Through workshops offered by Metro Works, residents are taught how to compost, how to choose the composting system that will work best for their group and how to start and maintain a composting program.  Groups may then build their own composting bins or purchase them from Metro at a subsidized price.  For more information, call Kate Middleton at (416)392-9807.
<HR>
<H2>Composting in schools and businesses</H2>
Composting is not just for the backyard anymore.  Composting programs have now started in schools and businesses across Metro Toronto.  Composting in schools not only diverts waste from landfill, but it's also a great way for students to learn about reducing the waste they generate.  To learn more about setting up a program in your school, call Kate Middleton at (416)392-9807.  <P>
To find out more about starting a program in your office, call Metro's Commercial Waste Reduction Hotline at (416)392-4200.
<HR>
<H2>Leaf & yard waste collection and composting program</H2>
Through the Metro Leaf & Yard Waste Collection and Composting Program, leaves and other yard waste from residential collection are composted at the Avondale windrow composting site in Maple.  When available, the resulting compost is distributed free of charge throughout the summer, at special sites across Metro Toronto.  The compost is a great additive for flower and vegetable gardens, lawns or house plants.  For more information, call the Composting Helpline at (416)392-4689.
<HR>
<H2>Composting information</H2>
A variety of informational factsheets are available in English.  A free how-to-booklet, "Be Good to Your Garden -- Compost!", is available in English, French, Chinese, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish.  To order, call the Publications Order Line at 392-5420.<P>
Information Officers are available to make presentations to schools and associations.  To find out more, or to ask anything about composting, call the Composting Helpline at (416)392-4689.
<HR>
<H2>Home composting education project</H2>
Metro Works has provided funding to the home composting education project, operated by the Recycling Council of Ontario.  Through the program, more than 150 volunteers have been trained as Master Composters.  These volunteers teach other residents how to compost through workshops, presentations and public displays.  The Master Composters have also constructed a number of composting demonstration sites across Metro Toronto. <HR>
<H2>Centralized composting</H2>
A one-year collection and composting pilot, offered to 13,000 homes in Etobicoke, North York and Toronto, studied the feasibility of curbside collection of food and yard waste for composting at a central composting facility.  The results are still being determined, but consideration has been given to undertaking a similar pilot involving apartment residents and businesses.<P>

<center><h1>Make Your Leaves Work For You</h1></center>

     When autumn comes to a forest and the leaves drop to the ground, assorted fungi and bacteria will help to transform the leaves into a rich dark mold which feeds the trees again in years to follow.  You can learn from this natural process and put it to good use in your own garden.  There are several ways you can use your leaves.
<HR>
<H2>Compost your leaves.</H2>
Leaves are rich in carbon, minerals and fibre.  A healthy compost pile requires materials rich in both carbon and nitrogen.  To maintain a healthy balance in your pile, especially in winter when most materials going into the compost pile are nitrogen-rich kitchen waste, keep a supply of leaves close to your bin in a garbage can or pail with a secure lid.  Always try to add equal volumes of leaves and kitchen waste to your compost pile.
<HR>
<H2>Build a leaf compost pile.</H2>
Build a separate compost pile for leaves only.  A covered wood and wire compost bin can be made easily at home.  Plans are available by calling the Compost Helpline at (416) 392-4689. To accelerate the composting process and substantially reduce the volume of leaves, shred them in a garbage can with an electric lawn trimmer, run a lawnmower over the leaves, or use a commercial chipper/shredder.<P>
Alternate 15 cm (6 inches) of leaves with a 2.5 cm (1 inch) layer of soil (or finished compost) and moisten the pile.  Cover the leaves with a final layer of soil.<P>
In the spring, when the leaves have thawed, mix in an equal volume of food waste and a few shovelfulls of soil.  During the summer, check the pile occasionally and water when dry. The leaves should turn into a rich, dark compost by the fall.
<HR>
<H2>Try alternative composting methods.</H2>
Place shredded leaves and handfuls of soil in garbage bags, moisten the mixture and close the bags.  Once a week, shake the bags to mix the leaves and hasten their decomposition. By spring you should have leaf mold in the bags which can be dug into the garden or used as a top dressing.
<HR>
<H2>Use your leaves as a mulch.</H2>
Mulch is a layer of material which covers the soil surface.  You can use your leaves as a mulch on your vegetable garden or flower beds.

<Blockquote><H3>Fall & Winter</H3>
In the fall and winter, mulch insulates your garden and prevents frost from damaging the flower beds.  Apply at least 15 cm (6 inches) of leaves for best results.  Pile deep layers of leaves, or bags of leaves, around sensitive plants, such as roses, rhododendrons and tender perennials.  <P>
Some gardeners bag leaves on a dry day and put them on beds of root vegetables to insulate them throughout the winter.  By marking the spot with a brightly painted broom handle, you can dig your carrots, rutabaga and parsnips when you want them.<P>
<H3>Spring & Summer</H3>
Save some leaves for use in the spring.  As a spring and summer mulch, the leaves will conserve soil moisture, keep plant roots cool in the hot sun, and control erosion.  The leaves will also add organic matter and nutrients to the soil.</Blockquote>
<HR>
<H2>Know your leaves.</H2>
Walnut, butternut and black locust leaves should be treated with caution when used as a mulch or composted.  They contain a substance which is toxic to many plants, called juglone.  Shallow-rooted plants and grain, Kentucky bluegrass and black raspberries are some of the plants not affected by juglone.  After a year of composting, the juglone breaks down and the compost can be used safely.  For this reason, you may choose to compost these leaves separately.<P>

<center><h1>Winter Composting</h1></center>
     Don't stop composting just because it's cold outside.  While the decomposition process will slow down, your compost pile will keep working all winter long.  Just follow the tips in this factsheet.  Next spring you'll be glad you made the effort.
<HR>
<H2>Fall preparation</H2>
To prepare for winter, empty out as much material as possible from your composter. The unfinished compost can go back into the bin or be dug into garden beds under a 15 cm 
(6 inch) layer of soil.  The finished compost can be dug into garden beds, stored in a dry place for use during spring planting or it can be returned to your bins where it will help to speed up the decomposition process when spring arrives.<P>
Follow the standard procedure for starting a bin.  Place old plants and brush in the bottom in a 10-15 cm (4-6 inch) layer.  Add a layer up to 15 cm (6 inches) of leaves (browns) and then an equal amount of food waste (greens).  Top with 2.5 cm (1 inch) of soil or finished compost.  Repeat layering browns, then greens, then soil. <P>
Over the winter months you will be generating mostly food waste.  In order to maintain a proper brown:green (carbon:nitrogen) balance, you will need a constant source of carbon to mix with the food waste.  Fall leaves are an ideal choice.<P>
Collect leftover fall leaves for use in your composter during the winter.  Shred the leaves using a lawnmower or trimmer.  Smaller pieces will decompose faster and take up less space.  Store your containers of leaves in the garage or outside within easy access to your bin.  Note: if leaves are left outside, make sure they are protected from wind, rain and snow.  <P>
For more information on using your fall leaves, see our factsheet <A href="leaves.htm">Make Your Leaves Work For You.</a>
<HR>
<H2>Maintaining a hot pile</H2>
Keep layering the materials in your bin throughout the winter, alternating equal amounts of greens, browns and soil.  This will ensure that you're creating a "hot pile" which will keep the decomposition process going.  While the helpful decomposer bacteria in your pile will continue to work in temperatures as low as -15 C, you can create additional heat by insulating your bin.  Try placing old pieces of carpet or bags of leaves around the sides of the bin.  Note: this is not recommended in areas where rodents are a problem as they like to nest in protected areas. <P>
Don't worry if the outer edges of your pile are freezing.  The decomposition process is still working in the centre of your pile and the freezing process will actually break down the fibres in the organics, allowing the material to decompose more rapidly when the warm spring weather arrives.
<HR>
<H2>Turning the pile</H2>
Turning the pile in winter may release too much heat.  For this reason, it's important that you alternate layers of materials and maintain the necessary ratio of carbon (browns) and nitrogen (greens).  Once the warmer weather arrives, you should turn the pile every week or two and blend in more leaves, soil or finished compost that you've saved from the fall.
<HR>
<H2>Storing food waste </H2>
If you would like to cut your trips to the composter back to once every few weeks, store your food waste indoors in a container and cover it with soil, peat moss, or preservative-and paint-free sawdust.  Or consider moving your composter closer to the house if you don't want to walk through the snow.
<HR>
<H2>Winter alternatives</H2>
Composting with worms is a great winter alternative, either indoors or outdoors using an insulated bin.  All you need is a bin, red worms and bedding.  To learn more about worm composting, call Metro's Composting Helpline at (416) 392-4689 for free factsheets and information on how to purchase a worm bin.

<center><h1>Balcony Composting</h1></center>
While apartment life may make composting more challenging, it is not impossible.  You can compost your food and plant wastes in a number of ways on your balcony or indoors. Here are some ideas on how to compost if you live in an apartment.
<HR>
<H2>Garbage can with airstack</H2>
If using a commercial garbage can, make sure it has a minimum base diameter of 38 cm (15 inches).  If making your own square container, its base should be a minimum of 9 square metres (3 square yards).  Both types of composters require an unobstructed height of 55 to 85 cm (22-34 inches).
<HR>
<H2>Drainage</H2>
There should be a minimum of 4 holes, 5 cm (2 inches) apart, in the bottom of the container.  <P>
Start your compost pile 7 to 15 cm (3-6 inches) up from the bottom of the bin to allow for sufficient air circulation and drainage.  This can be done by building a "false bottom".  Place a heavy gauge screen (1/4  or 1/2 inch hardware cloth) on top of blocks placed inside the unit.  You can also use a layer of sticks and twigs.  Remember to always keep the drain holes clear of obstructions.
<HR>
<H2>Aeration</H2>
You will also need an "airstack" of approximately 12 cm (5 inches) in diameter, leading from the false bottom up through the top of the container.  Commercial airstacks can be purchased at gardening centres or you can create your own with a piece of plumbers pipe or weeping tile.  There should be holes drilled all the way down the sides of the pipe or tile. A roll of hardware cloth or a bundle of sticks can also be placed in the centre of the container.  <P>
A hole must be cut in the lid of the composter for the airstack to fit through.  It should be a snug fit to help prevent insects and other pests from entering your composter.  For extra protection from pests, put a fine mesh over the top end of the airstack.
<HR>
<H2>Set-up</H2>
Place your composter in a sunny area.  To ensure there is enough air circulation around the composter, set it approximately 30 cm (12 inches) away from any walls.  Also make sure the container is raised 5 to 10 cm (2-4 inches) above the ground and a tray is placed underneath to catch any liquid that may drain out.
<HR>
<H2>Adding materials</H2>
You can use the same materials for apartment composting as you would for regular outdoor composting (see factsheet entitled "Materials to Compost" for a detailed list).  Although this type of composting can accommodate yard wastes, it is primarily for household kitchen and plant waste.  All materials should be as small as possible and well
mixed (use a variety of materials).  When putting in fresh kitchen wastes, it's a good idea to add some leaves or soil on top to help control insects.
<HR>
<H2>Helpful hints</H2>
<OL>
<LI>For every 2 cm (5 inches) of organic material add a cup of garden soil.
<LI>The pile should always be as moist as a well-wrung sponge.
<LI>It is a good idea to stockpile some fall leaves to add to your pile all year round.
<LI>Make sure your container has a tight-fitting lid.
</OL>
<HR>
<H2>Vermicomposting</H2>
Vermicomposting, or composting with worms, is another way for apartment dwellers to compost.  A worm bin can be set up indoors or can be insulated to stay outside on a balcony. For more information, call Robin Tench at (416) 392-9804.
<HR>
<H2>Mini backyard units</H2>
Metro Works currently distributes a limited number of "baby" composters that are half the size of most backyard units.  For $15.00 the units come complete with a synthetic textile liner in the base which absorbs moisture, removing the chance of moisture leaching out onto your balcony.  For more information , call Kate Middleton at (416) 392-9807.
<HR>
<H2>Community composting</H2>
By getting together with other residents in your building it might be possible to site a backyard unit or a larger 3-compartment unit on green space adjacent to your building or on your rooftop.  For more information , call Kate Middleton at (416) 392-9807.<p>

<center><h1>Pest-Proofing Your Compost Bin</h1></center>

     Are there pests in your neighbourhood?  You may not even be aware of any small critters like raccoons, mice, rats, insects, etc., until you start to compost.  Previously unnoticed pests may now be looking for a new source of food in your compost pile.  The best solution is prevention.  If you compost correctly, your pile will be less attractive to pests.  This factsheet outlines some general tips and specific methods of protecting your compost pile.
<HR>
<H2>Prevention tips</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Do not compost any meats, fish, bones, oils, fatty foods or pet manures.  Animals will be attracted by the smell and the decomposition process will slow down as these materials take longer to break down.
<LI>Place materials that are high in carbon (e.g. dry leaves or dead plants) at the bottom of the pile and along the inside walls of your compost bin.  This will provide good airflow, drainage and odour control.  A well-managed bin will not attract as many pests.
<LI>Cover any exposed food with a layer of dry leaves or a 2.5 cm (1 inch) layer of soil and bury food waste into the centre of the pile.  This will reduce smells which may attract pests.  Also, micro-organisms in the soil will help to speed up the composting process.
<LI>Take measures to build a "hot" compost pile.  This is an active compost pile in which the internal temperatures become very hot.  Maintaining a "hot" pile takes some extra effort, but it is an effective way to ward off unwanted pests and you'll have finished compost in a shorter period of time.
<LI>Harvest finished compost at the bottom of the bin every 3-6 months.  This will discourage some pests from nesting in the warm finished compost.
<LI>If possible, choose a location for your compost bin that has good drainage and at least partial sunlight.  This will improve the efficiency of your pile.  Place your bin at least 8-12 inches from fences, decks and buildings to discourage pests and to improve air flow.
<LI>Pests will be less likely to discover your compost if they are not already attracted by other sources.  It's a good idea to put your plastic garbage bags into a container at the curb, or to not put out your garbage bags until the morning of collection.  Keep leaves and other materials for your pile in a secure garbage can near the composter.  Piles of yard waste can provide a safe place for pests to hide.
</OL>
<HR>
<H2>Insects</H2>
Flies, wasps, hornets and bees can be discouraged from your compost bin by covering any exposed food, with a 2.5 cm (1 inch) layer of soil.  Add more soil, if necessary.  Add air to your compost pile by turning it or creating air channels by plunging a broomstick handle into the pile.  Also keep the pile slightly damp so that it will heat up.  The higher temperatures will kill any fly larvae and discourage bees, wasps and hornets from nesting.
<HR>
<H2>Rodents and other small animals</H2>
Pest-proofing your bin, as described below, will prevent any animal from tunnelling up through the bottom, or climbing into the bin from the sides or top.
<OL>
<LI>Use hardware cloth to line the bottom and outside walls of your bin.  For mice 0.5 cm (1/4"); 16 gauge should be used with 1 cm (1/2"), 20 gauge used for keeping out larger pests.
<LI>Get a tight-fitting lid or modify your existing lid by adding hinges and a latch.  Or stretch a bungy cord or chain across the lid and fasten it to the sides of the bin.  A heavy brick or rock will also keep the lid secure.  Note: bungy cords can be dangerous if children are assisting in the maintenance of the composter.
<LI>Pile rocks or bricks around the outside bottom of your bin as a good temporary measure against some burrowing animals.
</OL>
<HR>
<H2>Animal repellents</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Phone the Compost Helpline at (416) 392-4689 for homemade remedies made from natural      household products.
<LI>Environmentally safe animal repellents can be found in hardware and gardening stores      or pest control companies.
<LI>For information on ultrasonic sound devices used to repel rodents and other wildlife,      contact Agriculture Canada.
</OL><HR>
<H2>Other agencies</H2>
If rodent problems persist, or in the unlikely event that rodents are nesting in your bin, call your local public health department or authorized pest control company.  If a small animal gets trapped in your bin, call your local animal control service or the Humane Society.
<H2>Don't give up!</H2>
There are many ways to compost.  You will need to find the method that works best for you.  If outdoor composting proves too difficult, try composting indoors with worms.  It's easy and produces great compost.  Call the Compost Helpline at (416) 392-4689 for more details.

<center><h1>Insects, Bugs and Slugs</h1></center>
The process of decomposition in your compost pile is a very complex, but natural one. Living organisms purify the organic matter in the pile by digesting it. If you have just tried composting for the first time, you may be surprised by the community of small organisms that have taken up residence in your compost pile. These organisms, which include many insects, bugs, slugs, bacteria and fungi, form what is called a food web. <P>
In the food web, each organism has a job to do in turning your organic waste into dark, crumbly finished compost. Many have the job of eating other organisms and turning <U>them</U> into compost. In your finished compost, at least one-third of the volume is made up of the dead, decomposed bodies of soil organisms.<P>
The food web is divided into three levels as shown on the attached diagram. The roles of the organisms, at each stage of the decomposition process, are explained below.
<HR>
<H2>Who lives in the food web?</H2>
The most prolific members of your compost pile's food web are the bacteria. Every piece of organic matter you place in the pile is covered with varying amounts of bacteria as they digest the organic material and break it down into its basic elements. While digesting, they are also reproducing at an incredible rate. One gram of bacteria can become about 450 grams of bacteria in only three hours. There are many kinds of specialized bacteria operating in different temperature ranges.<P>
<B>Psychrophilic Bacteria</B> work best in temperatures of about 13C (55F), but can stay on the job even in below freezing conditions. This is why you will notice your compost pile sinking in the winter; these bacteria are busy breaking down organic matter. As these cooler bacteria go to work, their activity actually begins to heat up the pile. The increased temperature creates the ideal conditions for the next type of bacteria to arrive.<P>
<B>Mesophilic Bacteria</B> work best in temperatures of about 21 to 32C (70 to 90F), but can stay on the job in even hotter conditions. The activity of mesophilic bacteria can heat the pile up to even greater temperatures of 43C (110F).<P>
<B>Thermophilic Bacteria</B> become active when the temperatures reach a range of 40 to 93C (104 to 200F). If you notice your compost pile steaming in the morning or on a frosty day, it's because these bacteria are busy at work, purifying and decomposing your organic waste. These bacteria generally last for up to five days, and then the pile begins to cool.<P>
<B>Actinomycetes</B> go to work next. These fine, gray-coloured cobwebs are a cross between the bacteria and fungi that often excrete vitamins and antibiotics as they consume the organic waste in your pile.<P>
<B>Molds and fungi</B> get down to business along with the actinomycetes. They're closely followed by the members of the food web that shock many a new composter. These are small mites, springtails (little insects that hop like fleas), beetles, centipedes, sow (pill) bugs, flies, slugs and earwigs. The slugs, sow bugs, earwigs and beetles all excrete "castings" that are very dark and fine, like those of earthworms.<P>
<B>Worms</B> also arrive at this stage. Unlike the other small and "scary" creatures, worms are generally welcomed by new composters. As a result of the worm's well-deserved reputation for being excellent decomposers, many people think that it's a great idea to add extra worms to their compost pile. This is unnecessary. Let the worms find their own way into the pile, when the conditions are right. They prefer the pile when it is cooler, so adding worms could lead to their quick demise in the hot, steamy pile.
<HR>
<H2>Maintaining the balance </H2>
All members of the compost food web are very beneficial to your compost pile and should be left alone to do their work. They need each other to survive. If you remove any of the member organisms, through the use of insecticides, you will interfere with their natural cycle and contaminate your compost. While the organisms are busy recovering from the imbalance created in their food web, your compost pile will be decomposing much slower. On the other hand, if you are willing to closely monitor the temperature in your compost pile, you can speed up the process by gathering excess sow bugs, earwigs and slugs and adding them to your pile after it has cooled.<P>
Composters often fear that the hungry organisms in the compost pile may escape to the garden or lawn and eat everything in sight. Fortunately, this is not the case. The compost pile is their preferred environment. In fact, other organisms from the garden or lawn may leave their homes and go into the compost pile! However, if you are concerned about the food web in your compost pile "breaking out", try the following tips:
<OL>
<LI>Create a barrier by spreading a line of wood ash (not barbecue ash) around your compost pile. This will keep the activity contained within the pile.
<LI>A similar, but more lethal technique, is to sink small margarine containers full of stale beer, molasses and water, or yeast and water in the ground around the compost pile. Unsuspecting slugs, sow bugs and earwigs will be attracted to the liquid, crawl inside and drown.</OL>
<HR>
<H2>Don't get bugged!</H2>
Some bugs and insects may overpopulate parts of your garden. If this is the case, try the following solutions.
<Blockquote>
<H3>Earwigs</H3>
If you discover earwigs on your plants, simply spray the offending ones with a solution of one teaspoon of soap detergent combined with a quart of water. This will kill the earwigs that are doing damage and spare the helpful bugs that are eating dead organic material. Earwigs can also be trapped in rolled up newspaper, old hose or flower pots (turned upside down) and shaken into the compost pile.
<H3>Flies</H3>
Flies, particularly fruit flies, can be greatly reduced in the compost pile by burying all food waste in the centre of the pile and covering the top of the pile with a one inch layer of soil or leaves.

Always keep the bedding as moist as a well-wrung sponge. Never let the temperature of the bin (or the area that it is stored in) drop below 4 degrees C (40 degrees F) or rise above 27 degrees C (80 degrees F).

When adding food to your bin, always bury it under three to six inches of bedding. Imagine the bin is separated into six sections and bury food in a clockwise direction starting with section 1, then 2, then 3 and so on. Once you have reached the last section, return to the first section and start again.

Your worms are finished composting when both bedding and food scraps are replaced with "castings". Castings are tiny dark brown droppings with a sweet, rich earthy smell. Remove the finished compost as soon as possible as worms cannot survive in their own castings. There are several ways you can harvest your bin:
<p><br>

<img src="gifs/1.gif" alt="[1]" width=65 height=110 align=left >
<p><br>
Scoop all of the finished compost to one side of the bin and add fresh bedding and food scraps to the cleared area. The worms will travel from the finished compost to the fresh bedding in search of food. After about a week, you can remove the finished compost and add more fresh bedding.
<p>

<img src="gifs/2.gif" alt="[2]" width=92 height=88 align=left >
Under direct light, dump the contents of your bin in piles on a sheet of plastic. Brush away finished compost from the top of the pile and return worms to fresh bedding.
<p><br>


<img src="gifs/3.gif" alt="[3]" width=82 height=98 align=left >
Remove 1/2 to 2/3 of the finished compost (worms too) and add to your garden. Add fresh
bedding to the bin but do not overfeed your worms because they need about three weeks to
repopulate.

<p>
After composting about four to six months, your bin may have too many worms - red wrigglers reproduce quickly! Give extra worms away so friends may start composting. In the warmer months, release the worms in your backyard composter or garden, or take them fishing. Red worms make great bait!

<center><h1>Composting With Worms</h1></center>

     Vermicomposting, or worm composting, is the decomposing of organic waste with red worms.  It is a very convenient way of composting for apartment dwellers, school staff and students, persons with disabilities, office workers, elderly persons and anyone else who would have difficulty maintaining an outdoor compost pile.<P>
Vermicomposting creates a fine black granular compost called "castings".  Worm castings are an excellent source of slow-release soil nutrients for your plants or lawn.  They also act as an excellent soil additive that prevents the caking of soil in potted plants.
<HR>
<H2>Creating a home for your worms</H2>
<Blockquote>
<H3>Bedding</H3>Red worms can live in bins made from plastic or wood.  These containers are partially filled with bedding material, most commonly peat moss, shredded newspaper, shredded cardboard, straw or a combination of these materials.
<H3>Moisture</H3>The worm bedding should be kept as moist as a well
wrung sponge. Occasionally, the bedding can become too wet and needs to be gently loosened with a hand cultivator or small garden fork.
<H3>Acidity</H3>Redworms prefer a bedding that it slightly acidic.  However, if the bedding is all peat moss, or the materials added are very acidic, add crushed and dried egg shells to reduce the acidity.
<H3>Light</H3>Red worms are very sensitive to light and need an opaque bin that has a lid or a dark plastic bag placed over the bedding to keep out the light.
<H3>Ventilation</H3>Most bins also have some means of ventilation, either through holes drilled in the bin itself or a system of air tubing that runs through the bin from one side to another.  Additional dry bedding material can also be added to help keep air in the bedding.
<H3>Drainage</H3>Worm bins with holes in the bottom for drainage should be placed on one by two inch blocks on a plastic tray.  The tray will collect any liquid which may drain from the bin.  A piece of sheer fabric should be laid over the drainage holes to prevent the worms from falling through.</Blockquote>
<HR>
<H2>Choosing the size of your bin</H2>
The following guide will help you decide what size of bin you will need.  You should keep in mind that red worms eat their own weight in food every day.  In other words, if you produce two pounds of food waste everyday, then you should have two pounds of worms in your bin.  If you find that your red worms are being overfed, simply get another bin and more worms.

<HR>
<H2>Finding your worms</H2>
Redworms are available for purchase from commercial growers, but can also be found for free in your own backyard!  They are small, under four inches in length, and red, with alternating dark and light brown stripes.  Redworms live in organic matter which is in contact with the ground.  You will find them in decomposing leaves and decaying plant waste, manure, and the cooler decomposed parts of a compost pile.  They generally live within the top four inches of soil, thus they are called the "surface feeders" of the earthworm family.<P>
N.B.     Redworms are not the worms that appear on roads and sidewalks after a rainfall.
<HR>
<H2>Feeding your worms</H2>
Red worms, a.k.a. red wrigglers, trout worms, manure worms or tiger worms, eat almost everything that humans eat.  (See back page for a complete list.)  Worms should be fed at least every few days.  Simply bury the food scraps a minimum of one inch below the surface of the bedding and leave for the worms to eat.  Fresh food waste decomposes in about a week or two.
<HR>
<H2>Harvesting the bin</H2>
Every three to six months the red worms will have converted the food wastes and their bedding into a mass of rich dark castings.  When the volume of the bedding has decreased, becomes noticeably darker, and you begin to see individual castings, it is then time to change or "harvest" the bedding.  Worms do not survive in their own waste and must have it removed.
<HR>
<H2>Methods of harvesting</H2>
<Blockquote><H3>Layering</H3>
Expose the contents of the bin to light.  This will cause the worms to work their way down towards the bottom of the bin, as they will try to avoid the light.  As they move downward, remove one layer of compost at a time.  The last layer will be mostly worms.  Add new bedding and the vermicomposting process will start again.
<H3>Sorting</H3>
Prepare half the original quantity of fresh bedding.  Pull the contents of the bin to one side and add the new bedding to the cleared side.  Bury the food waste in the new bedding and let the worms find their way to it.  After one to two weeks, check to make sure most of the worms have moved to the new bedding.  Pick out any remaining worms.  Then remove the old bedding.  Repeat this process, when necessary, alternating each half of the bin for new bedding.</Blockquote>
<HR>
<H2>Removal</H2>
<Blockquote><H3>for Gardening</H3>Remove about two-thirds of the contents of the bin, and use the compost, complete with worms, directly on your garden during the gardening season.  Fresh bedding can then be placed in the bin, as there should be enough worms and cocoons to populate the new bedding.  Make sure that you do not overfeed the worms at this time.
<H3>Pile and Sort</H3>Dump the contents of the bin onto a large plastic sheet and separate into small cone-shaped piles.  Place a bright light above the sheet.  The worms will move down away from the light and you can then remove the compost from the top of each pile.  A small pile of worms will remain, which can then be weighed.  Add fresh bedding and replace the correct amount of worms.  The remainder can be used to start another bin for you or someone else.</Blockquote>

<center><h1>Putting Your Worms to Bed</h1></center>
     Bedding plays an important role in the worm composting process.  It is the environment in which your worms live and eat.  Keeping your worms happy and healthy means choosing a suitable bedding and maintaining it properly.  The five essential reasons for preparing a worm bedding are:
<UL>
<LI>to hold moisture in the bin
<LI>to allow for air circulation
<LI>to give the worms a moist place to live and work
<LI>to permit air exchange through the bedding
<LI>to control odours
</UL>
There are several materials that are suitable for bedding.  Remember that worms will eventually eat their bedding, so it must be made from natural materials - fibrous (cellulose) and non-toxic.  A table of suggested beddings is attached.
<HR>
<H2>How much bedding is required?</H2>
That depends on the size of your bin and the amount of food waste generated in your household.  Use the samples below as a guide.<P>
     <Blockquote>A 2 ft. x 2 ft. x 8 in. (60 x 60 x 20 cm) box will require 4 to 6 lbs. (1.8 to 2.7 kgs.) of dry bedding.<P>
     A 3 ft. x 2 ft. x 1ft. (90 x 60 x 30 cm) box will require 9 to 14 lbs. (4 to 6.3 kgs.) of dry bedding.</Blockquote>
You can use a utility or bathroom scale to weigh your bedding.  First, weigh yourself.  Then weigh yourself while holding a plastic bag filled with dry bedding.  The difference between the two weights is the weight of the dry bedding.  Repeat this procedure for the weight of the water described below.
<HR>
<H2>How much water is required?</H2>
A worm's body is approximately 75 per cent to 90 per cent water.  The bedding should have the same moisture content to allow the worm to breathe easily through its skin.  To create a 75 per cent moisture content, create a 3:1 ratio of water to bedding, by weight.  Use a scale or pint bottles to measure the weight of water.  (One pint = one pound.)
<HR>
<H2>Special additives</H2>
Add a handful of soil or a tablespoon or two of crushed, dried egg shells or powdered limestone (calcium carbonate) at the initial stage of bedding preparation.  This gritty material will help the worms to break down food particles in their gizzards.  There are additional benefits.  For instance, the crushed egg shells and powdered limestone will add calcium to the bedding, and prevent the material in the bin from becoming too acidic.<P>
Caution:     Using your egg shells makes good waste reduction sense.  But if you wish to buy powdered limestone, make sure you buy lime that is mixed with feed or agricultural lime.  Other types of lime can kill your worms.
<HR>
<H2>Preparing the bedding</H2>
Mix one-half of the bedding with about one-half of the required amount of water in a large mixing container.  Add one or two handfuls of soil, crushed egg shells or powdered limestone, then add some more water.  Mix until the water is well distributed throughout the container.  Add entire contents to worm bin and distribute evenly.<P>
Prior to adding your worms, check the temperature of the bedding to ensure that it is not too hot or too cold.  Temperatures above 27 C (81 F) could be harmful to the worms.  If the temperature is below 8 C (46 F), the worms may freeze.  The most ideal working conditions will occur in temperatures between 13 -25 C (55 - 77 F).  Keep in mind that if the temperature is uncomfortable for you to live in, then it will also be uncomfortable for the worms.  If the temperature is acceptable, you can add your worms.<P>

<center><h1>Be Good To Your Garden - Compost!</CENTER></h1></center>
     Composting is the natural process through which kitchen and yard wastes decompose into a dark, nutrient-rich soil conditioner.  If you have a garden, a lawn, trees, shrubs or even plant boxes, you can use finished compost to improve the soil and the plants growing in it.
<HR>
<H2>Why should I compost?</H2>
Composting is an easy and free way to recycle natural materials and reduce waste.  By using compost, you return organic matter to the soil.  This improves plant growth by helping break down heavy soils; adding moisture and nutrient-holding capacity to sandy soils; and adding organisms and essential nutrients to any soil.  Rich organic soil produces healthy plants which help clean our air and conserve our soil.<HR>
<H2>How do I compost?</H2>
The composting process requires organic material (food and yard wastes), air, moisture and soil.  A holding unit or container will help speed up the composting process and discourage pests.<HR>
<H2>What can I compost?</H2>
One-third of your household waste can be composted!  Yard wastes, such as dried leaves and grass clippings make excellent compost. You can also compost kitchen scraps including fruit and vegetable peels and trimmings, egg shells, coffee grounds and tea bags.  Don't compost meat, bones or fatty foods such as cheese, salad dressing or leftover cooking oil as these will slow down the composting process and may attract pests.  Don't compost dog or cat feces as these may contain harmful pathogens.
<HR>
<H2>How do I get started?</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Place the composter bin on level soil with good drainage, 20-30 cm (8.12 inches) from fences, decks or buildings.  The area should have at least partial sunlight.
<LI>Make a 10-15 cm (4-6 inch) bottom layer of coarse material such as dead plant stalks and small branches for improved air flow and drainage.  Then alternate equal layers of yard waste with kitchen waste and a 2.5 cm (1 inch) layer of soil.  No single layer should be more than 6 inches deep.
<LI>Keep the pile slightly damp.  Cover to protect from rain and pests.
<LI>Turn the pile often with a pitch fork or shovel so it gets lots of air.  If the materials are too heavy, just poke holes deep into the pile with a broom handle.
</OL>
<B>Note: </B>The composting process will still happen even if you don't follow all the steps mentioned above. However, to speed up the process air, light and water are extremely important.
<HR>
<H2>Can large quantities of fall leaves be added to the pile?</H2>
It is best to avoid making too thick a layer of any one material, particularly leaves.  They can clump together and be slow to break down.  You can put some leaves on your pile, but it's better to make a separate leaf pile.  (Make sure the pile has protection from the wind.)  You can also add some leaves directly to your garden, on the surface as mulch, or dug in as you turn the soil before early planting.
<HR>
<H2>Will it smell?</H2>
A compost pile that is working well should not have an unpleasant odour.  If it does, it may be that the material is too wet or too compacted.  Adding dry organics such as autumn leaves can help absorb excess moisture.  Turn the pile frequently to allow it to dry out a bit and to ensure that enough air is able to circulate.  Make sure that food waste is buried into the pile or covered with a 2.5 cm (1 inch) layer of soil.
<HR>
<H2>Can I compost in winter?</H2>
Cold weather will not destroy your compost.  The outside may freeze, but the centre of the pile will still be decomposing, just at a slower rate.  You can continue to add material to your pile throughout the winter.  In the spring, the decomposition process will become active again.
<HR>
<H2>How long will it take?</H2>
This will vary, if your kitchen and yard waste is in small pieces, the process will be faster.  Similarly, frequent turning will speed up the process.  Typically, a well-maintained pile will create finished compost within 2 to 4 months.<P>
When compost is ready for use, it will be dark and crumbly like soil and the original kitchen and yard waste should no longer be recognizable.  Screen the compost through a wire mesh to remove the larger chunks of material.  Add these back to the compost pile to finish their decomposition.
<HR>
<H2>How do I discourage animals?</H2>
A well-managed pile will not usually attract animals.  However, if you live in an area that has a high population of raccoons, rats or other pests, you may wish to "pest-proof" your bin before you begin composting.  Line the outside and bottom of your bin completely with heavy-gauge quarter-inch hardware cloth or galvanized wire.  Be sure to use a bin with a tight-fitting lid that can be secured.  For more information on pest-proofing your composter, order out pest-proofing factsheet.

METRO CYCLING AND PEDESTRIAN COMMITTEE</a></FONT></b>

<br clear=all>

<hr>


<p><center><b><i>WHO ARE WE and WHAT DO WE DO -- OVERVIEW</i></b></center></p>

<p>The Metropolitan Cycling & Pedestrian Committee (MCPC) is a special advisory committee of the Council of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, established to advise <a href="http://www.metrotor.on.ca/council/index.html"> Metro Council</a> on cycling and pedestrian  issues.  The committee provides a forum to address specific issues.  The committee provides outreach to cyclists, pedestrians and the public generally.  MCPC's objectives include:</p>

<ul>

<P>	i.   advising on the implementation of facilities and services to facilitate cycling and walking as a safe and viable mode of travel for commuting, recreation, and other trip purposes</P>

<P>ii.  co-ordinating initiatives pertaining to cycling among the six municipalities within Metro Toronto.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><!-- FONT SIZE=2 --><a href="mcc-puft.htm">Full text of MCPC's Terms of Reference</a><!-- /FONT --></P>


</ul><hr>



<p><b><i>STRUCTURE</i></b></p>

<p>The committee's recommendations are referred to the <a href="http://www.metrotor.on.ca/services/departments/schedule/pt.htm" target="_top"> Planning & Transportation Committee </a>of Metro Council.  The recommendations are then referred to Metro Council for final consideration.

<p>The committee also has five sub-committees that deal with specific issues:</p>



<ul>

<li><p><b><a href="mcc-npsc.htm">Network Planning Sub-Committee</a></b></p>

<p>	focusing on road bicycling facilities and design issues--promotion of Bike Lanes,  standards for cycling facilities, etc. </p>

<li><p>	<b><a href="mccssesc.htm">Security/Safety Education Sub-Committee</a></b></p>

<p>	focusing on theft ( ways to reduce it ), safety concerns, and bicycle safety education</p>

<li><p><b><a href="mcc-tisc.htm">Transit Integration Sub-Committee</a></b></p>

<p>	focuses on integration of cycling with public transit ( such as GO and the TTC ) allowing for intermodal travelling</p>

<li><p>	<b><a href="mcc-pisc.htm">Pedestrian Issues Sub-Committee</a></b></p>

<p>	focusing on pedestrian issues</p>

<li><p>	<b><a href="mcc-plsc.htm">Promotion/Liaison Sub-Committee</a></b></p>

<p>	focusing on public awareness of the committee, pedestrian and cycling issues.</p>

</ul><hr>



<p><b><i>MEMBERSHIP</i></b></p>

<p>The current committee membership consists of members of Metro Council,  representatives of groups interested in cycling issues, and citizens-at-large:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Metro Councillor<a href="http://www.metrotor.on.ca/council/maps/toronto.html#don_river" target="_top"> Jack Layton</a> is the Chair, and Metro Councillors<a href="http://www.metrotor.on.ca/council/maps/toronto.html#midtown" target="_top"> Ila Bossons</a>, and <a href="http://www.metrotor.on.ca/council/maps/york.html#eglinton" target="_top">Caroline DiGiovanni</a> are MCPC members.</p>

<li><p>	Members  from interested groups including representatives from cycling groups ( <a href="http://olc.ismcan.com/tbn.htm" target="_top">Toronto Bicycling Network</a>, Women on Wheels ) bicycle retailers, and couriers.</p>

<li><p>	Members representing various transportation and environmental groups ( Better Transportation   Coalition, Citizens for a Lakeshore Greenway ).</p>

<li><p>	Members representing Metro and Separate school boards and students in high schools and universities.</p>

<li><p>	Members representing local city cycling committees.</p>

<li><p>	Three members at large, who are selected from the public based on their interest in cycling and pedestrian activities. </p>

</ul>

<p>At the main meetings, only members of the committee can vote.  For the sub-committees, anyone can participate.  Membership is by attendance, and all members of the sub-committee can participate in decisions of the sub-committees.  Staff from <a href="http://www.metrotor.on.ca/services/departments/planning.html" target="_top">Metro Planning</a>, <a href="http://www.metrotor.on.ca/services/departments/transportation.html" target="_top"> Metro Transportation</a>, and <a href="http://www.metrotor.on.ca/services/parks/dept.html" target="_top">Metro Parks and Culture</a> are often on hand to assist the committee and the sub-committees.</p><hr>

<p>Respect for others, cycle like you would like others to cycle.</p>



<p>Be cautious of trucks making right hand turns at intersections.  The truck body will sweep inward to the curb.  Stay back so that you will not be pinned by the truck and knocked down on to the roadway.  Your life may depend on it.</p>

"Pipe Dreams: The history of water and sewer infrastructure in Metro"
</b></font>
<br clear=all>

<p><hr><p>

<b>Location:</b><br>
Metro Archives, 255 Spadina Road (one block north of Dupont <A HREF="../../abc/ttc_map.html">subway</A> station)
<p>
<b>Hours:</b><br>
Monday to Friday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m<br>
Sundays, 12 to 6 p.m. 
<p>
Where does your water come from?  What happens when it goes down the drain?  Water is essential to our survival yet the supply of clean water and the treatment of sewage is often invisible to us.  
<P>
An exciting new exhibit at <a href="../../departments/clerk.html#archives">Metro Archives</a> traces the development of water and sewage service in Metro.  <i>Pipe Dreams</i> brings Metro's invisible infrastructure to the surface and explores the changes in people's concerns and priorities regarding water.
<p>  
Learn about how the <a href="water.html">water and sewage treatment</a> processes have evolved, how the complex pumping and distribution system gets adequate water to your home, and how today's environmental concerns are changing the way some things are done.
<p>
For more information about Pipe Dreams  and other programs at the Metro Archives, call the public message number (416) 397-5000.
<p>

<font size=+2><b><i>Attention Educators!</i></b></font>
<p>
The <i>Pipe Dreams</i> exhibit is ideal for students in grades 8 through OAC.  An educational resource for teachers and students comprising a variety of activities and exercises has been produced to enhance a visit to the Archives or to a water or sewage treatment plant.  The materials cover technological, scientific, historical, social and geographical aspects of urban water supply and sewage disposal.  Experienced teachers have developed exercises for the common curriculum -- all levels; intermediate/common curriculum; senior/OAC; and independent studies projects.  The easy to use binder is free to teachers within Metro who book a tour of the exhibit.  For more information or to schedule a tour, call the special teachers' information and booking number at (416) 397-7393.

<H3>Calorad, a whole lot more than weight loss!<IMG SRC="images/new.GIF" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=35></H3>
<P>The benefits of taking Calorad are much more than just to lose the
desired inches/fat from your body.  Calorad is 100% natural and is 
a FOOD which helps with your body's overall well-being.  The main ingredient is
Collagen. Collagen is a complex structural protein that provides
strength and flexibility to the skin, hair and nails.  As you age, your body's 
ability to make collagen slows down.  This loss can result in thinning hair, 
less resilient skin and brittle nails.  By replenishing collagen in your body, 
you can help to restore strength and flexibility. Collagen not only provides 
the major building materials for growth, repair and maintenance of nails, hair 
and skin, it also is an essential and major component of muscles, tendons, 
cartilage, teeth, eyes and more. This is a fuel your body needs.</P>

<UL>
<H3><A NAME="history"></A>History</H3>

<P>Calorad was created by Michel Gris&eacute;, a scientist and preeminent
master formulator for both the private and public sector.</P>

<P>Calorad was originally formulated for the agricultural industry and
the results were, and still are phenomenal. Chickens exchanged fat for
lean muscle and became more efficient egg producers (thereby improving
profit to producers). The beef, pork and dairy industries experienced the
same results; less fat, more muscle and better production.</P>

<P>In 1985, Michel Gris&eacute; revised and improved his formula to deliver
a 100%&nbsp;natural, safe and effective pure food designed for use by people.
Since then, the results have been incredible!</P>

<P>This 12 year old technology with a proven record in Canada has just
been approved since Januray 1996 for distribution in the United States.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3><A NAME="how_it_works"></A>How Calorad works</H3>

<P>Take one tablespoon (15ml.) of Calorad with 8 fl. oz. of water on an
empty stomach just prior to going to sleep. Your last meal (last food,
coffee, tea, alcohol, etc. except water) should be at least 3 hours before
taking it. The stomach needs to be empty because there is an important
enzymatic process which occurs with the Calorad<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2> </FONT></SUP>in
your stomach, and solid food will interfere with its effectiveness. And,
if you read in bed before sleeping, wait until you are through reading,
and take Calorad<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2> </FONT></SUP>directly before you fall
asleep!</P>

<P>Calorad works during the first 45 to 90 minutes of sleep. While the
mind goes to rest the body goes to work in a process of revitalization
and repair. That critical 3-hour period is very important between your
last evening meal and snack, and the time you go to bed and take Calorad.
Setting your alarm clock for 1 or 2 am if you've had a late supper won't
work as well, because you will already have had most of your first 90 minutes
of sleep when you awake to take your Calorad.</P>

<P>Calorad positively enhances the body towards optimum health during this
time period when it is taken correctly.</P>

<P>It is recommended that you stay on the program for a minimum of 3 months,
but results can occur in the first week or month. An incredible 86% of
Calorad<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2> </FONT></SUP>users will experience some positive
result within the first 90 days! Fifty percent of those will see a result
within the first month! And 25% within 60 days; the remaining 25% within
90 days. </P>

<P>There are no side effects or contraindications. Pre-puberty children
and pregnant or lactating women should not take the product. Some medical
conditions might slow results.</P>

<LI><A NAME="How does Calorad"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>How does Calorad work?</FONT></LI>

<P>Calorad is a nutritional supplement as well as a weight management product.
Its protein formula supports the body in building lean muscle tissue. For
those who carry around excess weight, the building of lean muscle tissue
assists the body in burning sugars and fats more efficiently. For those
who are trim, Calorad supports the body by building strength and vitality.</P>

<P>Calorad is good for all body types. It is a food supplement, more specifically
a protein supplement, that enhances the body's natural mechanism of rejuvenation
and repair. What is meant by &quot;the body's natural mechanism of rejuvenation
and repair?&quot; When we go to sleep at night, the first 45 to 90 minutes
of sleep are a period of productivity in the body. Our minds go to rest,
but our bodies go to work in a process of revitalization and repair. Calorad,
when taken on a stomach empty of food for at least 3 hours, with a glass
of water, directly before sleep, fuels and feeds that process. Just like
any protein that builds the body, Calorad builds in a heightened way when
taken in the prescribed manner.</P>

<P>The beauty of the program is that it is simple. The only behavior shift
necessary is the cessation of food intake 3 hours prior to sleep, which
in and of itself is a very healthy behavioral shift. In most diets, the
behavior modification is to deprive the body of calories or specific food
groups (like carbohydrates). This leads to perhaps some quick fix weight
reduction but results in the loss of muscle mass which is imperative for
efficient food processing. In most diets, 30% muscle mass is sacrificed
for weight loss. With Calorad, the building of muscle is what incurs the
weight reduction and consequently people lose inches as well as pounds.
Many people lose inches before they ever lose a pound, fitting differently
in their clothes or perhaps dropping a dress/pant size without noticing
any changes on the scale. In fact, there are those who initially put on
weight but lose inches because muscle weighs two times as much as fat.</P>

<P>The results show up differently in each subjective body. Some will experience
noticeable results in the first week and some not until the third month.
Some will lose steadily at a very slow rate (for instance one pound every
two weeks) and some will plateau out for a while. Calorad supports differently
for different body types. A small percentage of the population, estimated
at around 14%, will experience no weight reduction with Calorad for reasons
ranging anywhere from latent thyroid problems to personal chemistry. Those,
however, will benefit from the ingredients in Calorad much in the same
way they benefit from taking vitamin and mineral supplements. There is
no wrong experience of the product. It is simply life supporting in various
ways for different people. At minimum, Calorad is a 90 day program to experience
the full range of benefits applicable to your body's potential.</P>

<P>

<LI><A NAME="How do I take Calorad for optimum weight"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>How
do I take Calorad for optimum weight management results?</FONT></LI>

<P>One table spoon of Calorad should be taken directly before sleep, at
least 3 hours after your last meal, with a full 8 ounce glass of water.
You can mix the Calorad with the water or drink them separately. Calorad
should be the last thing you do before sleep. If you plan to read or watch
tv. you should wait to drink Calorad until you finish those activities.</P>

<P>Calorad works best if the stomach is empty of food for at least three
hours and you take it just as your head hits the pillow.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<LI><A NAME="How do I take Calorad for energy and"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>How
do I take Calorad for energy and stamina?</FONT></LI>

<P>Calorad works to sustain daytime energy levels when taken in the above
&quot;night time&quot; manner. For endurance and stamina</P>

<P>Calorad can also be taken during the day approximately one half hour
before meals. Athletes can take Calorad forty-five minutes to a half hour
before working out to support endurance and strength.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<LI><A NAME="How should I take Calorad if I don't want to take off weight"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>How
should I take Calorad if I don't want to take off weight?</FONT></LI>

<P>Calorad is primarily a nutritional supplement. Individuals who need
to lose excess pounds and inches experience these results with Calorad
because it supports the body in building muscle mass and consequently burning
fats and sugars more efficiently.</P>

<P>Calorad is not exclusively for any one body type, however, it can be
taken by all physical types alike as a strength optimizer and nutritional
support product. For individuals taking Calorad as nutritional supplement,
either of the above methods are appropriate for usage.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<LI><A NAME="Can I take Calorad if I'm taking other vitamins and minerals"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Can
I take Calorad if I'm taking other vitamins and minerals? How about if
I'm on medication?</FONT></LI>

<P>Calorad works with virtually all other nutritional supplements, that's
the great part. We suggest that if you take other nutritional supplements
you take them with your last meal to maximize the efficacy of Calorad.</P>

<P>Calorad works best when there is no other activity in the digestive
system. Similarly, if you are on medication it is best to take it with
your last meal. If you have any questions about the compatibility of your
medication with Calorad we strongly suggest you take Calorad to the health
practitioner of your choice before proceeding.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<LI><A NAME="What happens if I or my potential customer have"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>What
happens if I or my potential customer have (diabetes, high blood pressure,
etc.)?</FONT></LI>

<P>The answer is always the same. Although Calorad is pure and simply a
protein supplement, we always recommend when in doubt, take it to a professional
health practitioner.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<LI><A NAME="Are they any conditions under which I should not take Calorad"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Are
they any conditions under which I should not take Calorad?</FONT></LI>

<P>Pregnant and lactating women should not use Calorad. And prepubescent
children should not take Calorad.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<LI><A NAME="Can I have a snack during the three hours between my last meal and sleep"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Can
I have a snack during the three hours between my last meal and sleep?</FONT></LI>

<P>NO. Even a small piece of candy or fruit interferes with Calorad working
to its maximum effect. Three hours is the only restriction placed on the
diet with Calorad. We do recommend that individuals eat a healthy, well-balanced
diet during the day to stay fit. This includes foods from all the major
food groups. The beauty of the Calorad program is that it works best when
you do not deprive yourself of nutrients the body needs to function (including
fats and carbohydrates). The only behavioral shift is to stop eating at
least three hours prior to sleep. And this, in and of itself, is an extremely
healthy shift to make.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<LI><A NAME="Where is collagen from"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Where is collagen
from?</FONT></LI>

<P>Collagen is a fibrous protein found in connective tissue. In Calorad,
it is taken from the connective tissue of Canadian cows. We use Canadian
cows because they are held to very stringent health standards.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<LI><A NAME="What is potassium sorbate and methyl paraben"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>What
is potassium sorbate and methyl paraben?</FONT></LI>

<P>Potassium sorbate and methyl paraben are both extracts from blueberries.
Potassium sorbate is the lactose acid from blueberries and acts as a natural
preservative in Calorad. Methyl Paraben in alcohol extracted from blueberries
and acts as a bonding agent as well as a natural preservative.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<LI><A NAME="What if I don't like the taste"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>What if
I don't like the taste?</FONT></LI>

<P>Although we rarely hear that, it does come up once in a while. Here
are our suggestions. You can hold your nose so you won't taste anything.
Or you can dilute it in water.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<LI><A NAME="What kind of positive results can I expect in the first 30 days"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>What
kind of positive results can I expect in the first 30 days?</FONT></LI>

<P>Not everyone will experience dramatic and profound inch loss in the
first thirty days. Almost all will experience better sleep, improved over-all
fitness, muscle toning, and increased energy. We encourage you to pay close
attention to the positive transformations in your body. The results vary
over a wide range of reported victories.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<LI><A NAME="What happens if it doesn't work in the first 30 days"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>What
happens if it doesn't work in the first 30 days?</FONT></LI>

<P>To draw conclusions after the first thirty days is a premature evaluation.
Calorad works differently with each subjective physiology. This means results
could show up anywhere from one to three months into the program.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<LI><A NAME="What happens if it doesn't work in 30-60 days"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>What
happens if it doesn't work in 30-60 days?</FONT></LI>

<P>Again, the second month of Calorad may be too soon to judge with a particular
person. One important tip is to put the scale away and pay attention to
the inches and how you fit in your clothes.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<LI><A NAME="What happens if it doesn't work after 90 days"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>What
happens if it doesn't work after 90 days?</FONT></LI>

<P>If you have not experienced inch reduction after the third month of
taking Calorad, you may fall into the 14% of users who will not benefit
from Calorad as a weight management product. There are several reasons
for this incompatibility ranging from latent thyroid problems to personal
chemistry issues. If you fall into this population, it does not mean that
you will not benefit from the nutritional advantages Calorad promotes.
There is an intensive Calorad program for individuals who do not experience
results and wish to embark on an overall cleansing method to increase the
potential of Calorad's proper functioning.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<LI><A NAME="What happens if someone gains weight with Calorad?"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>What
happens if someone gains weight with Calorad?</FONT></LI>

<P>It is important that the scale not be the measure of success with Calorad
because muscle weighs more than fat. We suggest that you put the scale
away and pay attention to inches lost and the way you fit into your clothing.
Sometimes people put on weight initially with Calorad because the change
in their body's muscle composition reflects as pounds on the scale. These
same people, however, report inch reduction and muscle tome that attests
to the building of their bodies in a positive way.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Important things to remember when taking Calorad<SUP><FONT SIZE=+1>&reg;</FONT></SUP></H1>

<LI><B>Be Committed <BR>
</B>This is a 3 month program. There is an <B>86% success rate</B> when
taking Calorad, 50% of the people have their results in the first month
and the other 50% have results evenly in month 2 and 3. So if you are one
of those people who will not have your results until the 3rd month, and
you stopped after only 1 month you would never know how many inches you
could have lost because you gave up. You would be doing yourself a great
injustice.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>

<LI><B>Wait the 3 hours before bed <BR>
</B>The best results occur when your stomach is empty. If you can be committed
to not eating anything for 3 hours before you go to bed and then take Calorad,
you will have the results more quickly because your body can absorb Calorad
more readily when your stomach is empty. If, on an occasional evening,
you need to go to sleep and it has only been 2 hours still take your Calorad.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>

<LI><B>Measure yourself first<BR>
</B>It is important to remember that by taking Calorad, you will be building
lean muscle tissue and that muscle weighs 3 times MORE than fat. So you
might not see as much of a change on the scale when weighing yourself,
but what will go away is the fat on your body, so you will see a change
in your body composition. This is the result that you desire. So before
you start the Calorad program, measure your entire body and then periodically
throughout the program you can re-measure to see where your have lost the
inches and how much overall.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>

<LI><B>Record your health <BR>
</B>In order to help track any changes in your new lifestyle, you might
want to print this <A HREF="tip_table.html">table</A> and make 4 copies,
fill one out before you begin, and fill the others out the end of each
month. Since many changes will happen over time, this will help you to
determine what has really evolved. Your body knows its own priorities and
utilizes this product where it is needed most. Hence there will be different
timing based on each individuals needs. </LI>

Only, but you will earn <B>commission </B>if it is a qualified business
center (has $200.00 sales from the center). This sales volume need not
be purchased all at one time. It can accumulate and become qualified.</P>

<P>If you sign up as <B>TRIO</B>, three business centers will be awarded
IF the primary center is fully qualified at once (purchasing $200.00 of
product). These two #2 and #3 will hold volume for 90 days waiting to be
qualified ($200.00 volume for each). They must be qualified in this 90
day period or they will become non-active. The associate will not be in
the position to have a Trio after this time period. If at a later date
the associate wishes to open a new Business center, they may do so but
it will be placed somewhere in their downline and must be fully qualified

<P>Let's take an example. You've completed your application form and created

You then recruted and trained two people, Susan and Robert. Here is what

<P>Once you have $400 <A HREF="glossary.html#Group Business Volume">Group
Business Volume</A> in each <A HREF="glossary.html#Sales Organization">Sales
Organization</A> (Left and Right), you receive a $250 commission check.
An additional $800 <A HREF="glossary.html#Group Business Volume">GBV</A>
on each side, you will receive an additional $500 in commission. In order
to get an additional $1,000 in comission, you'll need to have an additional
$1,600 of <A HREF="glossary.html#Group Business Volume">GBV</A> on each
side. This commission plan allows you to receive as much as $1,750 per
week! All monetary values are in U.S&nbsp;Dollars. </P>

<P>Until you've reached the maximum comission available for your <A HREF="glossary.html#Business Center">Business
Center</A> ($1,750), the remaining <A HREF="glossary.html#Group Business Volume">Group
Business Volume</A> generated by your <A HREF="glossary.html#Sales Organization">Sales
Organization</A> is carried over to the next computation period. </P>

<P>Once your <A HREF="glossary.html#Business Center">Business Center</A>
has started earning, there is a monthly <A HREF="glossary.html#Personal Sales Requirement">Personal
Sales Requirement</A> of $100 in order to receive a comission check. </P>

<H3>Duplicate </H3>

<P>This is a very simple business. You help Robert, on your left, to duplicate
your efforts by creating his own Business Center and to find two people
to build his organization. Robert, will then train the two people his organization
to do the same. You then do the same with Susan.</P>

<H3><A NAME="How to increase"></A>How to increase your profit? </H3>

<P>If you desire to build a larger Sales Organization, then you have the
option of starting with 3 Business Centers.&nbsp;By purchasing $200 of
products, upon completing the Business Associate Application Form, you
will automatically open 3 Business Centers. By building two Business Center
(#2 and #3), you'll earn on all 3! For example, here is what your Sales
Organization could look like: </P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/biz2.GIF" HEIGHT=390 WIDTH=422></P>

<P>The Group Business Volume of Robert, Pam and their Sales Organization
would accumulate and generate comission for your Business Center #2. Similarly,
the Group Business Volume of Curtis, Susan and their Sales Organization
would accumulate and generate comission for your Business Center #3. Additionaly,
the Group Business Volumes used for the Business Center #2 and #3 feed
into the Business Center #1 to make you eligible for a third commission
check. </P>

<P>Therefore, each Business Center can earn up to $1,750 per week. <B>That's
a total of $5,250 a week! </B></P>

<P>In order to qualify your 3 business center, there is a minimum monthly
Personal Sales requirement of $100 for BC #1 and $75 for BC#2 and BC#3.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Business Center commission"></A>Business Center commission
schedule </H3>

<P>To understand how you are paid, it is important to remember that BV
= 50% of the Associate's cost of products. Therefore, if you sale $200
of products, this equals to $100 BV.</P>

<P>1. You must have sufficent volume on the left and right to be eligible
for each increment of the commission schedule. All the extra BV is carried
forward to the next computation period. Maximum BV: $2,800 left and $2,800
right.</P>

<P>2. Each active Business Center may achieve earnings of $1,750 weekly.</P>

<P>3. Commisions are calculated weekly, and payed biweekly.</P>

<P>4. The only qualifications to earn commisions on a weekly basis is $100
Personal Sales volume once a month.</P>

<P>5. No limits to depth on which you receive commisions.</P>

<P>6. No costs to become a Business Associate.</P>

<H3>Calorad, a whole lot more than weight loss!<IMG SRC="images/new.GIF" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=35></H3>
<P>The benefits of taking Calorad are much more than just to lose the
desired inches/fat from your body.  Calorad is 100% natural and is 
a FOOD which helps with your body's overall well-being.  The main ingredient is
Collagen. Collagen is a complex structural protein that provides
strength and flexibility to the skin, hair and nails.  As you age, your body's 
ability to make collagen slows down.  This loss can result in thinning hair, 
less resilient skin and brittle nails.  By replenishing collagen in your body, 
you can help to restore strength and flexibility. Collagen not only provides 
the major building materials for growth, repair and maintenance of nails, hair 
and skin, it also is an essential and major component of muscles, tendons, 
cartilage, teeth, eyes and more. This is a fuel your body needs.</P>

&quot;My results with Calorad have been phenomenal. I take Calorad during
the day for energy and stamina. I don't need to lose any weight, but there's
no denying the toning that's taking place. My calves are harder and more
defined, my thighs are tighter. It's really quite remarkable. I've given
Calorad to my patients with tremendous success. A physician colleague is
seeing his abdomen muscles like never before and is taking off pant sizes.
The ingredients are completely safe and effective.&quot; </P>

<DIV ALIGN=right><P>Dr. C.J. Middleton, D.C., Los Angeles, CA</P></DIV>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>&quot;I have been a chiropractor with a large nutritionally-based practice
for the past 25 years. I was introduced to Calorad 6 weeks ago. Having
heard what Calorad was supposed to do, I was interested in testing it.
We tested Calorad on our homeopathic computer and found it to be very pure
with no detectable residues. I then &quot;muscle tested&quot; it on many
patients. I found an amazingly high degree of biocompatibility. Calorad
truly does help people to lose inches, gain muscle tone and sleep better.
I have begun using Calorad on patients with both chronic and acute joint
pain with very good results. Since bringing Calorad into the office, we
have sold on the average 2 cases a week. Many of our patients who have
experienced the wonders of Calorad have become distributors and are helping
many of their family and friends find better health with Calorad.&quot;
</P>

<DIV ALIGN=right><P>William R Emard, D.C., Quartz Hill, CA</P></DIV>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>&quot;I have probably used the product longer than any other person
on the planet. And in addition to that I had the good fortune of monitoring
over 300 patients over a one-year period of time on the use of the product.
I monitored people that ranged in age from 17-years of age up to 77 years
of age with a variety of backgrounds and health histories. They included
people with high blood pressure, arthritis and many more conditions. Over
that one year period of time we averaged a weight loss of 4 pounds of fat
per month. I want to stress that we did a lot of testing. We did hydrostatic
weighting so that we would know exactly how much of the reduction was happening
in adipose tissue and how much was actually conversion of lean muscle mass.
Our results were extraordinary. I want to point out that our people were
not placed on a caloric restrictive diet. They were recommended to maintain
a good balance between fats, carbohydrates and proteins, to be sensible
with their diets and reduce sugars. We did not require that they exercise.
So the result of an average 3.75 pounds per month for over 300 people is
pretty phenomenal statistic. We also found that in that entire group we
had less than .6, less than 1% of the people had any loss of lean muscle
mass. We had 36% of the group that actually gained lean muscle mass during
that time.</P>

<P>Now what got people really excited was the fact that we lost as much
in inches per pound as we dropped in poundage. In other words, for every
single pound that was dropped from the body we saw 3.75 inches lost from
the body, and that was pure fat and without caloric restrictions. Another
thing that I liked about the product was that we all tightened up. We all
got firmer, and looked younger. It's truly an amazing product. For you
guys out there who have handle bars on the side, most of you will find
that in a month or two they'll be gone. And for us gals, we enjoyed some
wonderful things like losing the jowls under the chin and the flab under
the arms, and the skin of the thighs tightened up nicely. So we all thought
that the product was pretty dynamic. I personally took it for almost 4
years. I had a child late in life at age 42. After I delivered my son I
started back on Calorad and lost 38 pounds in one month. I have virtually
no stretch marks. I am a very short, tiny person. My son was 22 inches
long. One of the things I want to ask Michel is that if we can freeze this
stuff, I'd like to have a lifetime supply.</P>

<P>Calorad is very reliable and very safe. The only side-effects from the
product that we ever found were positive side effects. Something that I
didn't mention and that is very significant in the high-stress environment
that we all live in today is that, without exception, there is an attitude
change. Every user experiences a much greater sense of well-being which
occurred within the first couple of weeks. That's a marvelous health point
for everyone because if you feel better you are inclined to perform better
in your life. In the original study we saw a number of people begin to
exercise, not because they were required to but because they felt better.
I don't know what the magic is in the chemistry, I'm not sure anyone does,
but I do feel that some of it revolves around the quality of the human
being who developed the formula, and that very special energy which is
Michel Grise, I believe is translated into the product. We've learned in
science that there is energy coefficient involved. Michel Grise is a very
high human being and I believe that who he is affects the efficacy of the
product.</P>

<P>Ten years later down the road, there still isn't anything out there
that works like Calorad.&quot; </P>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>&quot;I have been a Chiropractic Physician for over 36 years and I pride
myself on the fact that I do all the things I tell my patients to do. Eat
right, exercise and make sure that I get the correct nutritional support
But mother nature has a way of sneaking up on a person and I was starting
to notice those not so subtle signs of being 61, love handles, softening
connective tissue, etc. For a person who is married, to a woman who is
23 years younger, this was not acceptable. Since starting Calorad three
weeks ago I have lost 2&quot; off my hips and all of my love handles and
am starting to notice an improvement in my connective tissue. My patients
are as excited about Calorad as I am and we look forward to a long, slim,
healthy association with Essentially Yours and Calorad.&quot; </P>

<P>&quot;My Ph.D. is in clinical nutrition and I've been working in the
nutritional field for 16 years. One of my focus areas is tracking people's
health problems to their root as nutritional deficiencies. From my broad
experience researching health in relation to nutrition, I recognize Calorad
as a product that is positively needed by everyone, whether they have a
weight problem or not. My experience with this product has been astounding.
My patients, under less than ideal stress conditions, are losing weight
and inches and gaining energy. Calorad stimulates a source of natural energy
in the body and those who are taking it are becoming self-evident testimonies
to the power of this incredible wellness resource. There is no need to
&quot;try out&quot; this product. It is an important source of nutrition
for all bodies alike and it works. I would say it's the next universal
juice drink.&quot; </P>

<P>&quot;I've been a chiropractor for the past 28 years and currently run
a clinic that sees 200 people a day. Calorad came into my possession a
little over a month ago and changed my outlook on life completely. At the
time I started on Calorad I was suffering from pneumonia and was 20 lbs
overweight. In the first few days the pneumonia completely disappeared
and my energy was back in tact. In the last four weeks I've taken off 18
lbs and have witnessed truly amazing results with my patients. An obese
patient of mine dropped 34 lbs in 2 weeks, reversing a condition that seemed
impossible. Inches and pounds are coming off like crazy. I've got couples
fighting over the bottles in my office. I'm so thrilled to be able to expand
my wellness practice with a product that safely and naturally helps people
lose weight. I know I can recommend Calorad and expect tremendous health
results for my patients.&quot; </P>

&quot;Calorad has changed my life. I'm 70 years old and I've been dieting
since I was 13. Not a day has gone by when food was not a conflicted experience
for me. I've tried every diet from grapefruit to Slimfast to a $1000 Park
Avenue diet that forced me to give up every food I love. On these impossible
schemes I've yo yo'd all my life. Until Calorad. Six weeks ago my relationship
with Calorad began and since then I've taken off 10 lbs, reshaped my entire
body, taken off 2 pant sizes and a dress size! I feel fabulous and I'm
living a guilt-free life of ease and enjoyment with food. I haven't modified
my diet in the least and I'm literally melting away. Calorad has changed
my life irreversibly.&quot; </P>

<P>&quot;Boy am I excited! I've lost 31 lbs. in under a month. I don't
know what to say except that I feel like I'm in my 20's again. That kind
of sums it up. I feel healthy, vitalized, firm and sexy. And I didn't do
a thing other than one tablespoon with water on an empty stomach before
bed. To be honest with you, I tested the Calorad by giving it my best appetite.
And I still lost weight! I've dropped two dress sizes and am close to a
third. On other programs I gained weight. They were impossible to sustain,
they were depressing and I ate more. Calorad not only makes me feel healthier,
it inclines me to act healthier. I couldn't be any happier. Calorad is
miraculous!&quot; </P>

<P>&quot;I have lost ten lbs. and 7 1/2 inches in 2 1/2 weeks without gaining
it back. I was a heavy child and found myself gaining 10 lbs, every year
of my adult life. I tried all the diets available but could not stick with
any of them. I am now losing weight without trying and with no side effects.
I feel more comfortable in my clothes and have a lot more energy. Calorad
really works!&quot; </P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>&quot;In the last 3-1/2 weeks I've lost 15 lbs taking a product called
Calorad. I haven't changed my diet and I haven't done any exercise. I just
take a tablespoon of Calorad before bed on an empty stomach. I've lost
so many inches that some of my pants I couldn't even fit into are now falling
off. My knees don't hurt any more. I can run up a flight of stairs. My
back only hurts occasionally now. Best of all, I feel 20 years younger.
It's not a buzz, like you get from caffeine -more like a feeling of overall
wellness. My younger brother and my 74 year old mother are now taking Calorad.
Best of all, when I lose all the weight I want to lost (about 56 more lbs).
I can simply switch to taking the Calorad in the morning -and that's the
entire maintenance program&quot;. </P>

&quot;I come from a hockey background, playing juniors in the hot bed of
American Ice hockey, Michigan. I currently do management and marketing
for a Southern California team and am quite conscientious about optimum
fitness myself. I am a weight lifter and have been in good condition athletically
and nutritionally all my life. When I started taking Calorad, I was in
the midst of a grueling project at work. I couldn't get to the gym and
I was curious to see what Calorad would do for me. In under a month I took
off three inches in my waist, going from a 34 to 31. I have stomach muscles
now that no amount of working out could ever achieve for me. I have far
more definition and am trimmer than when I previously worked out more rigorously.
I couldn't be happier. Calorad is strengthening and supporting me in ways
I never could have imagined.&quot; </P>

<P>&quot;I am an avid body builder and have been paying attention to personal
fitness as a passion for many years. I work out consistently, at least
4 times a week and am acutely aware of the way my body looks and feels.
Since I've been taking Calorad, I've noticed some tremendous changes in
my physical well-being. For one, my energy level has evened out. My three
o'clock dip has disappeared and I feel consistently healthy and energized.
As far as my external appearance goes, I'm seeing definition and toning
that is new and extremely exciting for me. In the last few weeks I've been
inundated with people from the gym and elsewhere asking me what I'm doing
that's working so well! I'm very happy and more fit than ever. </P>

<P>&quot;I am an aerobics instructor by trade. I didn't have any weight
to lose coming into my Calorad experience and was curious to see what this
&quot;muscle-builder&quot; would do for my body. Well, in my second month
of taking the product I'm noticing some pretty incredible things. I do
a lot of cardiovascular exercise but have not been lifting at all since
I started Calorad. Amazingly, my arms are now more defined than they were
when I was lifting weights. I'm starting to see cuts in my leg muscles
that have never come to the surface before. Just the other day I visited
my massage therapist who has supported me as an athlete for ten years.
He could not believe the enormous change in my body's muscle composition.
He was blown away that the body he had been working on for 10 years had
transformed so magnificently in just over a month. He wanted to know what
I was doing and bought two bottles of Calorad immediately. I didn't know
that I could feel better and stronger than I did a month ago, but Calorad
has changed my life in some pretty significant ways. </P>

&quot;I own a retail store called Supernatural Health Foods in Grandview,
Missouri. Janet Henry brought Calorad to my store and I decided to buy
my first 5 bottles before she left. Four bottles sold from the store and
then a customer came in who is the Head Nurse at Research Hospital. She
was extremely overweight (about 270 lb.), had a thyroid problem and a hormone
patch. I told her about Calorad and she bought a bottle right away. She
took my very last bottle and 2 days later she called me and said, &quot;you're
not going to believe it - this thing is shrinking my body!&quot; About
four days later she called and reported that all the sogginess under her
arms was tightening up!! That got me excited, I thought my Goodness there
is something to this. I began giving customers a brochure and saying, &quot;read
it, if you are interested, call us back&quot;. That worked because I ended
up having 75 people waiting for Calorad and I had to keep ordering 6 dozen
bottles at a time. Since that first experience, I went through 9 cases
in 4 weeks and I sold over 200 bottles since May. My goal is just to get
the word out because I'm so excited about the product - it works and it
is helping a lot of people. Tami, one of my salespersons is taking Calorad.
She and her husband are splitting the first bottle right now. In 2 1/2
weeks she said, &quot;It's incredible!! I have lost 2 1/2&quot; off my
rib cage, 2&quot; off my waist, 3&quot; off my hips and 1&quot; off each
thigh. On the 4th day, I began to feel significant muscle toning on my
thighs and calves. The toning and tightness is just incredible. Calorad
makes it so easy to sell with enthusiasm because the results are so immediate.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;For the past 12 years I have owned and operated &quot;For Ladies
Only Beauty Salon&quot;. I had never done any Network Marketing before
when I was invited to a meeting by Sue Hale. I went not knowing what to
expect. I only wanted to try Calorad first to make sure it worked, but
the meeting was so exciting and the presentation so reasonable, I decided
to buy five bottles and try the business. I still didn't know exactly what
I was going to do. I simply put a sign on the door that read: Lose weight,
no diet or exercise required, and I put some Calorad brochures on the counter.
What a surprise!!! The very next day I had to call Ray in Los Angeles for
5 more bottles and by that night I had to call for 5 more. At first my
customers wanted to wait to see what results I was going to have, but before
I had been on Calorad even 3 days, they came back and said, just give
me a bottle now. You're going to be skinny and I'm not and then I'm going
to be upset.' Also, I had been ill for the last year and on a lot of antibiotics.
My energy was gone and I was just dragging. I was going to doctors and
getting blood tests to try and find out what the problem was. After taking
Calorad the first night, I couldn't believe it. I felt like my old self!!
I will never give it up for just that!!! Even my family and friends saw
the change right away and asked if I was OK?? And then I sold it to all
my friends because they saw my energy change. From that point on I have
sold 10-12 bottles of Calorad per week from out of my salon and from return
customers!!!&quot; </P>

<H3>What is Network Marketing?</H3>

<P>Network marketing is a business idea that is not understood by most
people, yet it is the most advanced business concept available on the planet
today and it is so simple that anyone can learn to become very successful
in a short time.<BR>
</P>

<H3>Mistrust in Network Marketing</H3>

<P>People often have bad feelings about Network Marketing: &quot;It's a
pyramid&quot;</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>Standard corporations are a pyramid (President, VP, Executives, Manager,
Employees, ...)</LI>

<LI>Social Security is the only &quot;legal&quot; pyramid<BR>
</LI>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="Why"></A>Why is it a great opportunity?</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>If networked products were sold through the normal distribution chain
you could add 30% to the price.</LI>

<LI>You are teaching people how to stay healthy and save a lot of money
buy doing so. When they share these incredible products with others they
can even make some money.</LI>

<LI>The average person &quot;sells&quot; something 10 times a day by recommending
a restaurant, movie, store, etc.</LI>

<LI>The FTC (Federal Trade Commission) requires that Network companies
pay 66% of sales in bonuses to it's distributors, sharing the profits.</LI>

<LI>Saving 30% on products is a good reason to get in</LI>

<LI>Earning extra income is even better</LI>

<LI>Being able to buy unique, quality products is another reason.</LI>

<LI>The convenience is incredible. Would you change your buying habits
to earn an extra $2,000 a month?<BR>
</LI>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Other Incentives </H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>Minimal start-up costs </LI>

<LI>Travel opportunities </LI>

<LI>Empowering others and personal growth </LI>

<H3>The sky is the limit!</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>It is not uncommon at all for people to earn 6 figure incomes who work
the business for 2-5 years.</LI>

<LI>More millionaires in network marketing than in any other business.</LI>

<LI>Incredible tax advantages for having a home based business.</LI>

<LI>However, it is not a get rich quick scheme<BR>

<P><B><BLINK>Did you know?</BLINK></B></P>

<LI>Half of all executives regularly work not 40, but more than 60 hours
a week.</LI>

<LI><B>Fifty percent</B> of all retired people enter retirement with <B>less
than $10,000 in savings</B> and can look forward to living on one third
to one half of their former salary.</LI>

<LI>The average person is carrying <B>$15,000 of consumer debt</B>, not
counting mortgages and cars, and that makes it impossible to save for retirement.</LI>

<LI>If you are <B>under 35</B> you probably <B>won't see social security</B>.</LI>

<LI>Do you know how much you'll need to save right now to have a retirement
income of say $25,000 annually? You'll need a total of $450,000 to live

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="The 3 ways"></A>The 3 ways to make money</H3>

<H4>1. Trade time for dollars</H4>

<P>Everyone falls into this category even self employed people. If you
have to get paid, it is a job!</P>

<P><B>JOB</B> is<B> Just Over Broke</B>, which is where your job will keep
you. Your job holds you hostage. This way of making money is for your employer
not you.</P>

<P>Less than one percent of the millionaires in America made their fortunes
by trading time for money. Yet, 95 percent of Americans are using this
one financial vehicle to make a living and to try to accomplish their goals,
if they have any left.</P>

<H4>2. Investing your money</H4>

<P>Another way to make money is to invest it in the stock market, real
estate, limited partnerships, mutual funds, or other investment vehicles.</P>

<P>If you have one dollar that is earning 4% interest. Remember, this is
taxable income. If you are in the highest tax bracket, paying nearly 50%
in state and federal income taxes that means you are 2% ahead. Inflation
is 4% so you are losing 2%, that is $2 on every $100.</P>

<P>When you invest your money, your money is working for you. Fourteen
percent of all millionaires made their fortunes this way. Yet only two
percent of the people create their principal incomes this way.</P>

<P>Percentage of investors who profit from investments is low. You must
have extra money to invest in the first place.</P>

<H4>3. Investing your time</H4>

<P>The third way of making money is to leverage, or invest, your time in
other people. Leveraging your time is the key to lasting wealth in America.
When you leverage your time, you create more time and more money. 85% of
all millionaires in America created their fortunes this way-yet only 3
percent of us aredoing this.</P>

<H3><A NAME="There are 4 ways"></A><B>There are 4 ways you can leverage
your time</B></H3>

<P><B>Hire Employees<BR>
</B>You create more volume in sales by hiring others in your organization.<BR>
<B>Limitations</B>: expensive, not reliable, lazy, you cannot take vacations,
they steal from you, they demand benefits</P>

<P><B>Chain Stores<BR>
</B>This is a good way to grow the business.<BR>
<B>Limitations</B>: you cannot be in two places at once, a lot of debt
from expansion, no vacations, they still demand raises and benefits.</P>

<P><B>Franchise<BR>
</B>Franchise your business: Turn key operation that doesn't require a
lot of employees.<BR>
<B>Limitations</B>: you must train them, you make no money unless they
do, desirable locations disappear, competition is tough, economy is unstable,
profit margins are thin, real estate goes up, average fee for franchise
is $85,000, most people cannot qualify to buy a franchise.You are still
trading time for dollars.</P>

<P><B><A HREF="netmktg.html">Network Marketing<BR>
</A></B>This solves the limitations of franchising. It adds business depth
where franchising adds only business width.</P>

<UL>
<LI>Most people have heard about Network Marketing, but they usually don't
have a first hand experience. It is based on &quot;stories&quot;.</LI>

<LI>People are ready to put up with Fortune 500 companies laying-off, treating
employees poorly, laundering money and going from scandal to scandal, but
don't want to hear anything about Network Marketing companies... WHY?</LI>

<LI>The industry is now regulated and very legitimate.</LI>

<LI>By the end of the 90's, a good share of the people you know will be
involved with some form of <A HREF="netmktg.html">network marketing</A>
(the way the distribution system is going), so why not <A HREF="business.html">join
in now</A>?<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></LI>
</OL>

<OL>
<LI><A NAME="What type of Marketing"></A><B>What type of Marketing potential
and real value does the product have?</B></LI>

<P>Essentially Yours Industries Corp. products have proven value, are in
demand and sell! 
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<LI><A NAME="Does the business offer"></A><B>Does the business offer immediate
gratification to the beginner?</B></LI>

<P>You only need to introduce two excited people, not 6, 8, 10, or 20 as
in other programs. You do not have to wait to do tens of thousands of dollars
worth of sales volume to receive a performance check. Just two organizations
(legs) building to $400.00 in each and you earn $250.00. And it gets better
as you and your organization grows. 
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<LI><A NAME="How realistic are the"></A><B>How realistic are the requirements
and quotas in order to earn commissions?</B></LI>

<P>You only need to do $200.00 in personal volume to qualify and earn on
your organization's volume. You only need two good producers, two organizations!
Statistics prove that this is realistic. Essentially Yours Industries Corp.
does have monthly sales volume requirements but they only come into effect
after you are earning commissions. 
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<LI><A NAME="How high are the"></A><B>How high are the monthly sales requirements?</B></LI>

<P>Essentially Yours Industries Corp. requires $100.00 or in some cases
$75.00 in personal sales volume per month from representatives, once they
start earning commissions. 
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<LI><A NAME="Does the business require"></A><B>Does the business require
you to continue sponsoring more and more people, even building additional
personal group volume in order to earn?</B></LI>

<P>No! You only need two personally sponsored associates to qualify for
lifetime income. However, you sponsor more and support them to grow, your
income will grow as well. 
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<LI><A NAME="Does the business offer a weekly"></A><B>Does the business
offer a weekly or monthly pay?</B></LI>

<P>Once you build your organization in Essentially Yours Industries Corp.,
you will be paid biweekly. That means two checks per month. Your business
volume is calculated weekly however, maximizing your profit potential on
the volume your organization generates. (each business center can earn
up to $1,750.00 per week. If you have three business centers, your income
could reach $5,250.00 per week.) 
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<LI><A NAME="Do you accumulate organizational"></A><B>Do you accumulate
organizational volume until you get paid, or do you lose it each commission
cycle or when someone in your downline qualifies?</B></LI>

<P>This is one major pitfall in other plans. With Essentially Yours Industries
Corp., you will never lose your qualifying organizational volume from a
commission cycle, or even from someone in your downline qualifying before
you do. This practically guarantees your success. Your volume accumulates
until you are paid, whether it takes a week, a month or even a year. 
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<LI><A NAME="Does the business have"></A><B>Does the business have a &quot;Break
Away &quot; feature?</B></LI>

<P>In the Essentially Yours Industries Corp. Binary Marketing Plan there
are no negative incentives and you never make less because of someone else's
success. 
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<LI><A NAME="Does the business promote"></A><B>Does the business promote
inventory loading?</B></LI>

<P>There is no reason or incentive to do this with Essentially Yours Industries
Corp.. Whether you buy $600.00 or $6,000.00 makes no difference. Commissions
are paid on direct sales performance and only $200.00 Personal Volume is
required to qualify a Business Center. You cannot beat that! 
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<LI><A NAME="Does the business maximize"></A><B>Does the business maximize
duplication and multiplication of income?</B></LI>

<P>Once you qualify, you can multiply your income by having additional
Business Centers. All new Business Centers work to qualify previously existing
Business Centers. It is a work of genius! No other plan is as effective!

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<LI><A NAME="How does ESSENTIALLY YOURS"></A><B>How does Essentially Yours
Industries Corp. compensation plan compare to other Binary Marketing Plans?</B></LI>

<P>Essentially Yours Industries Corp.<B> </B>requires less sales volume
to earn more income than most other binaries. Essentially Yours Industries
Corp. requires two-thirds less volume to earn the same income as another
binary that is doing exceptionally well marketing jewelry (many of you
will know the company). And as a little extra tid bit, the originator of
the Binary Marketing System is David Crowe. Thank you for this wonderful
marketing plan David. The rest of us are imitators! 
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<LI><A NAME="Are there any taxes"></A><B>Are there any taxes on Essentially
Yours Industries Corp. products?</B></LI>

<P>All products are purchased through Essentially Yours Industries Corp.
All applicable state taxes, provincial taxes and city taxes must be collected
by both the company and the associate when selling the products. Any products
or literature brought into Canada are further subject to Canadian Duties
and GST. <BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<LI><A NAME="If I sign up"></A><B>If I sign up as an Associate only, can
I later change to a Single business and then later to a Trio Business?
</B></LI>

<P>If you sign up as an <B>ASSOCIATE ONLY</B>, then you are a person who
buys product at associate cost for personal use or resale. This position
will <B>NOT </B>receive a commission. The associate only position may be
upgraded by sending in a request to upgrade and an order for $200.00. The
associate only position will then be a SINGLE. (1 income center).</P>

<P>If you sign up as <B>SINGLE</B>, then you are the same as the Associate
Only, but you will earn commission if it is a qualified business center
(has $200.00 sales from the center). This sales volume need not be purchased
all at one time. It can accumulate and become qualified.</P>

<P>If you sign up as <B>TRIO</B>, three business centers will be awarded
IF the primary center is fully qualified at once (purchasing $200.00 of
product). These two #2 and #3 will hold volume for 90 days waiting to be
qualified ($200.00 volume for each). They must be qualified in this 90
day period or they will become non-active. The associate will not be in
the position to have a Trio after this time period. If at a later date
the associate wishes to open a new Business center, they may do so but
it will be placed somewhere in their downline and must be fully qualified
at the time of application. </P>

<UL>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Five concepts to help you appreciate the power of the
Essentially Yours network binary marketing plan.</H3>
</UL>

<UL>
<OL>
<LI>A BINARY IS NOT MULTI-LEVEL. In a binary, &quot;levels&quot; are irrelevant.
(We use the term &quot;links&quot; instead of levels, as we don't want
to use words that might cause people to associate a binary with multi-level
marketing.) In a binary, a person could have one leg which is only a few
links deep and another leg which is many hundred links deep, yet it is
still possible to maintain balanced volume if the undeveloped leg has more
high volume producers. This situation would not be profitable in a multilevel
plan. (A binary is definitely network marketing, yet it operates more productively
than most multilevel marketing.)<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></LI>

<LI>If one has created a &quot;runaway leg,&quot; they have actually created
a very fortunate situation! To experts of binary marketing, a &quot;runaway
leg&quot; is an advantage, not a problem. If you have one leg that far
outperforms your other leg, you are actually fortunate because your job
is half done for you. It is because the &quot;runaway leg&quot; is so strong
that one can concentrate on the undeveloped leg. This concept is often
misunderstood by those who compare the binary to multi-level marketing.<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></LI>

<LI>In a binary, the upline is far less likely to compete with the downline
for the same people because the system requires depth, not width. In multi-level,
one has to build wide because MLM plans tend to penalize when one places
high volume producers under low volume producers. However, in a binary,
one is actually better off placing high volume producers under low volume
producers because it motivates everyone and it doesn't penalize you one
cent. In fact, it creates a built-in support system.<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></LI>

<LI>In a binary, strong recruiters have no choice but to put newly sponsored
distributors underneath those previously sponsored. The structure itself
dictates it. MLM does not encourage people in the upline to build under
those in the downline because the compensation systems penalize distributors
for giving away their recruits. The binary system rewards them.<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></LI>

<LI>WEEKLY PAYOUT COMPUTATION - Affords special benefits and advantages.
The Essentially Yours binary computes payment every week, so that excess
volume is not discounted as it would be in longer payout binaries. With
this system it is unnecessary to manipulate processing new applications.</LI>
</OL>

<P>Receiving frequent checks and the satisfaction of helping to Improve
the quality of life for others are the motivating forces behind the Essentially
Yours network binary plan. With these products and this marketing plan...EVERYONE
WINS!!!</P>

<P>Most of us are becoming ill and <A HREF="./html/weight_loss.html">overweight</A> because of poor eating habits or just from eating the average American diet.&nbsp; Adding to that too much stress and not enough rest can really create havoc for your body.</P>
<P>The average American diet consists of non-vitalized, processed, over-cooked foods which have been robbed of their original nutritional value. Unless you are enjoying good health and eating mostly raw fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts and seeds, as well as cutting down on stress, exercising and getting proper rest, chances are you have headaches, backaches, leg aches, chest pains, tiredness, overweight and are just plain &quot;burned out&quot;.</P>
<P>The sad truth is that <B>Americans are getting fatter</B>.&nbsp; A recent study by scientists at the National Center for Health Statistics in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that the number of <B>overweight adults</B> in America has <B>increased 32%</B> in the last ten years.</P>
<P>It is human nature to oppose change, and we will think of all kinds of excuses why we shouldn't.&nbsp; It is a well known fact that most of us take better care of our automobiles than we do of ourselves. If we put &quot;junk fuel&quot; in our auto it begins to knock, ping and act sluggish. It only stands to reason, if we put &quot;junk fuel&quot; in our bodies, the same thing occurs. The old adage, <B>&quot;You Are What You Eat&quot;</B> is very true.</TD>

<P>Most of us are becoming ill and <A HREF="./html/weight_loss.html">overweight</A> because of poor eating habits or just from eating the average American diet.&nbsp; Adding to that too much stress and not enough rest can really create havoc for your body.</P>
<P>The average American diet consists of non-vitalized, processed, over-cooked foods which have been robbed of their original nutritional value. Unless you are enjoying good health and eating mostly raw fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts and seeds, as well as cutting down on stress, exercising and getting proper rest, chances are you have headaches, backaches, leg aches, chest pains, tiredness, overweight and are just plain &quot;burned out&quot;.</P>
<P>The sad truth is that <B>Americans are getting fatter</B>.&nbsp; A recent study by scientists at the National Center for Health Statistics in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that the number of <B>overweight adults</B> in America has <B>increased 32%</B> in the last ten years.</P>
<P>It is human nature to oppose change, and we will think of all kinds of excuses why we shouldn't.&nbsp; It is a well known fact that most of us take better care of our automobiles than we do of ourselves. If we put &quot;junk fuel&quot; in our auto it begins to knock, ping and act sluggish. It only stands to reason, if we put &quot;junk fuel&quot; in our bodies, the same thing occurs. The old adage, <B>&quot;You Are What You Eat&quot;</B> is very true.</TD>

<P>Fifteen years ago, scientists at <A HREF="http://www.carringtonlabs.com/">Carrington Laboratories</A> discovered a significant phytochemical in fresh aloe, which is called a <B>betamannan</B>.&nbsp; Within hours of cutting a fresh aloe leaf, that natural enzyme the betamannan breaks down into simple sugars which DESTROYS its functional capacity.&nbsp; The scientists' developed a processing method that (1) deactivates the destructive enzyme and (2) stabilizes the functional component, called a betamannon in the fresh cut aloe vera plant.&nbsp; And through a freeze-drying dehydration process, they make this into a powder.&nbsp;&nbsp; The final product of the patented process is trademarked <B>Manapol<FONT SIZE="-1"></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000">, the only nutraceutical-grade aloe vera extract with a scientifically standardized level of aloe betamannans.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;Researchers from <A HREF="http://www.carringtonlabs.com/">Carrington Laboratories</A> spent tens of millions of dollars to discover, stabilize and standardize a unique labile polysaccharide (betamannan molecule) in fresh aloe vera that scientists world-wide believe is responsible for its unprecedented reputation. Carrington has over 66 patents worldwide on the processing technique, composition of matter and pharmaceutical uses, making it one of the most secure and effective functional food products to enter this new market. In 1995, Carrington licensed the rights to Manapol to <A HREF="./html/mannatech.html">Mannatech International</A>. Mannatech is the clear leader in this newly emerging field.</TD>

<P><FONT SIZE="+4">A</FONT>mbrotose is a plant carbohydrate that will supplement the diet with sugars shown to be essential in the process of producing correctly structured glycoproteins. <B>Glycoproteins</B> are produced by our bodies through the use of eight essential polysaccharides, one of which is Mannose as contained in Manapol.&nbsp; Some of the more outstanding results experienced by some people using Mannatech products has been traced to the Mannose supplying an essential nutritional deficiency instead of the Manapol's support of the immune system.</P>
<P>Scientists have learned that Glycoprotein-molecules found on the surface of all cells, play a key role in ALL cellular communication.&nbsp; The name, glycoprotein, is derived from the molecules' composition:&nbsp; Sugar (glyco) and protein.&nbsp; Since up to 85% of glycoproteins are composed of 8 known specific polysaccharides, important to the healthy functioning of the human body, the need for these is essential.&nbsp; In other words, if any of these essential sugars are missing, glycoproteins will not be structured properly and <B>CANNOT</B> communicate correctly.</P>
<P>Correct communication between the body's cells is critical if the body itself is to function precisely.&nbsp; Incorrect function can result in debilitating conditions and disease.&nbsp; If cells don't communicate correctly with each other, the cells can fail to recognize external invaders such as certain bacteria and viruses and thus fail to defend themselves and fall victim to disease.</P>
<P>Some scientists tell us that all disease is the result of an abnormality of glycoproteins at the cellular level.&nbsp; The 1996 edition of Harpers Biochemistry Chaper 56 provides many insights into the role of glycoproteins in maintaining health.</P>
<P>How can we create the essential building blocks?&nbsp; Where do we get the raw materials to build these important glycoprotein molecules?&nbsp; <BR>Ultimately, only plants can capture the sun's energy to produce the carbohydrates (sugars) the body requires.&nbsp; This makes the plants in our diet of primary importance.&nbsp; From a universe of about 200 monosaccharides (sugars) found in nature, eight of them have been found important to the body's healthy functioning.&nbsp; If adequate supplies of the necessary sugars are not available, the process does not occur at optimal capacity.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mannose sugar (which is found in the aloe vera plant and has been the foundation of all Mannatech's products up until now) is one of the 8 sugars found that make up the glycoprotein.</P>
<P><A HREF="html/mannatech.html#scientific_team ">Mannatech's scientists</A> recognized that the necessary 8 sugars <B>MUST</B> either be synthesized by the body or obtained from dietary supplements.&nbsp; So they developed a patented compound called <B>Ambrotose<FONT SIZE="-1"></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000">that is now the new foundation to all their products.</FONT></P>
<P>It is expected that by adding Ambrotose to Mannatech products, that the results people will experience are even more dramatic.&nbsp; For example, auto-immune diseases such as Lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, MS, etc. are the result of altered glycoproteins.&nbsp; When just one of the essential polysaccharides is missing in our diet, the body's ability to communicate at the cellular level is compromised.&nbsp; Two of these polysaccharides are common in most diets.&nbsp; Six of them are rare.</P>
<P>At a recent awards banquet with Mannatech, there was a family and their three year old daughter who had undergone chemotherapy, two unsuccessful bone-marrow transplants and had tried Mannatech products without success. She was given the Mannatech products with the Ambrotose on Monday, August 19th and by Friday, August 23rd she was producing her C-7 Chromosomes!&nbsp; <B>Never before in medical history has this been accomplished!!!</B></P>
<P>The implications of this new technology is enormous.&nbsp; <A HREF="./mannatech.html">Mannatech's</A> scientists are the world leaders in complex carbohydrate technology.</TD>

<P>Fifteen years ago, scientists at <A HREF="http://www.carringtonlabs.com/">Carrington Laboratories</A> discovered a significant phytochemical in fresh aloe, which is called a <B>betamannan</B>.&nbsp; Within hours of cutting a fresh aloe leaf, that natural enzyme the betamannan breaks down into simple sugars which DESTROYS its functional capacity.&nbsp; The scientists' developed a processing method that (1) deactivates the destructive enzyme and (2) stabilizes the functional component, called a betamannon in the fresh cut aloe vera plant.&nbsp; And through a freeze-drying dehydration process, they make this into a powder.&nbsp;&nbsp; The final product of the patented process is trademarked <B>Manapol<FONT SIZE="-1"></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000">, the only nutraceutical-grade aloe vera extract with a scientifically standardized level of aloe betamannans.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;Researchers from <A HREF="http://www.carringtonlabs.com/">Carrington Laboratories</A> spent tens of millions of dollars to discover, stabilize and standardize a unique labile polysaccharide (betamannan molecule) in fresh aloe vera that scientists world-wide believe is responsible for its unprecedented reputation. Carrington has over 66 patents worldwide on the processing technique, composition of matter and pharmaceutical uses, making it one of the most secure and effective functional food products to enter this new market. In 1995, Carrington licensed the rights to Manapol to <A HREF="./html/mannatech.html">Mannatech International</A>. Mannatech is the clear leader in this newly emerging field.</TD>

<P><B>Weight-Loss Pills Need More Study</B></P>
<P>NEW YORK (Reuters) -- Diet drugs should be used only in obese individuals whose excess weight poses a serious health risk, according to a new report. The drugs, including the recently FDA-approved dexfenfluramine (sold under the name Redux), are no panacea for obesity, said researchers from National Task Force on the Prevention and Treatment of Obesity. </P>
<P>&quot;Medication may make it easier to resist temptation, but the ability to make long-term changes in diet and exercise remains the key to permanent weight loss and improved health,&quot; stated lead study author Dr. Susan Zelitch Yanovski in a release from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). </P>
<P>&quot;There's little justification for the short-term use of weight-loss drugs, because most patients regain lost weight when they stop taking medications,&quot; according to Yanovski, director of the Obesity and Eating Disorders Program at the NIDDK. &quot;This does not mean that these drugs are ineffective, but that obesity is a chronic disease that requires long term treatment.&quot; </P>
<P>However, the analysis of 20 previously published studies found that very few have looked at patients taking weight-loss drugs for more than 6 months, according to the report in this week's Journal of the American Medical Association. The studies included prescription appetite-suppressants, such as dexfenfluramine (Redux), fenfluramine (Pondimin), phentermine (Adipex-P, Fastin, Oby-Trim) and others. </P>
<P>Until more research is done, such drugs &quot;cannot be recommended for routine use in obese individuals, although (weight-loss drugs) may be helpful in carefully selected patients,&quot; the authors wrote. </P>
<P>The drugs can result in a loss of about 5 to 22 pounds when used in combination with dieting and exercise. However, weight loss hits a plateau at 6 months, and once drug-use is discontinued the lost weight is usually regained. </P>
<P>Most side effects of these drugs are relatively minor, including dry mouth, sleep disturbances and diarrhea. However, in rare cases, potentially life-threatening conditions can result, including primary pulmonary hypertension -- a severe constriction of blood vessels in the lungs that can cause heart failure. This rare disease occurs in 1 out of every 22,000 to 44,000 people taking prescription weight-loss drugs for more than 3 months. </P>
<P>The &quot;major promise&quot; of weight-loss medication is to &quot;enhance longer-term maintenance of weight lost with conventional therapies,&quot; wrote Yanovski, executive director of the Task Force that put together the report. </P>
<P>One out of every three people between the ages of 20 and 74 in the US is overweight or obese -- an estimated 58 million people. Obesity increases the risk of diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease. SOURCE: Journal of the American Medical Association (1996;276:1907-1915) </TD>

<P><B>Add The Essential Fats </B></P>
<P>Eating enough dietary fats is also an important consideration for anyone wanting to burn more fat and spare sugar. The only real &quot;bad&quot; fats in the diet are the artificial ones, like margarine and other hydrogenated fats, and fried or over-heated fats. All natural fats are good for your body as long as you consume them in moderation and you have healthy metabolism.</P>
<P>For most people this means about 30% of the diet can be fats, but they should be a balance of omega-6, omega-3 and, if your eat them, animal fats. Omega-6 fats are found in vegetables and most vegetable oils such as extra virgin olive and safflower. Omega-3 fats can be found in fish, beans, and linseed (flaxseed) oil. If you don't eat animal foods, some omega-3 or -6 fats will convert to arachidonic acid, the fat found in animal products. Good dietary sources of animal fats include butter, egg yolks, cheese and all meats including beef. A balance of these three fat groups will provide you with enough fats for a healthy lean body.&nbsp; Eating essential fatty acids (such as omega-3 oils and omega-6 oils) can help you become thin.&nbsp; EFAs move other fats, including the bad LDL cholesterol, out of the body.</P>
<P>Fat makes a wonderful source of energy.&nbsp; It levels out blood sugar.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some fat in the diet is necessary to assist the process of burning off stored fat.&nbsp; Dietary fats are one of the best ways to stimulate your metabolism, which is what you want to do if you goal is to increase fat burning. A fast metabolism converts fat to energy quicker.</P>
<P>Fat can also keep your appetite satisfied for up to six hours at a time.</P>
<P>You must not feel guilty about eating the correct kind of fat.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your health will suffer from it and you will have trouble losing weight.</TD>

<P>Look around you: everybody is living on high-carbohydrate, low-fat foods. It is supposed to be the key to good health promoted by the masses. This is very misleading and is actually making people very sick, in a very insidious way.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Despite eating less fat, <B>Americans are fatter than ever</B>. Why?&nbsp; Because <B>fat does not make you fat</B>, insulin does.&nbsp; There are two ways to increase insulin:</P>
<UL TYPE="DISC">
<LI>Eat too much food at any one meal, or</LI>
<LI>Eat too many carbohydrates</LI>
</UL>
<P>What most people do not realize is that the most commonly consumed carbohydrates (like pasta, bagels, breads and potatoes) actually quickly release sugar into the bloodstream and then, if not immediately used, this sugar is turned into <B>BODY FAT!!</B>&nbsp; Your body only has a limited amount of storage space for excess carbohydrates.&nbsp; It has, however, a limitless ability to turn excess carbohydrates into fat.</P>
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>When eating a high-carbohydrate meal, the level of glucose in the blood stream augments (more or less, based on the glycemic quality of the ingested carbohydrate.&nbsp; The <A HREF="./glycemic_index.html">glycemic index</A>&nbsp; is the rate at which a carbohydrate breaks down to be released as glucose into the bloodstream).</LI>
<LI>This augmentation triggers the secretion of insulin from the pancreas. The purpose of insulin is to carry the glucose through the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm of the cells for metabolism and use for energy. </LI>
<LI>Whatever glucose is not immediately consumed is converted into glycogen (glycogen synthesis), a stored form of energy used for later retrieval. </LI>
<LI>Glycogen is stored in the liver, the muscles and the spleen in limited amounts. The rest of available glucose gets stored in the adipose tissue (stored fat) where it is converted to fatty acids and then tryglicerides. </LI>
<LI>Insulin inhibits the breakdown of glycogen and tryglicerides back to glucose. </LI>
</OL>

<P>Each Income Center has two sides, a left and a right. Once the Income Center is permanently qualified, BV is accumulated on each side as sales are made. A $200 bonus is paid when both sides each accumulate $1,000 BV. This process of accumulation and pay is continued until the Income Center has earned a total of $1,200. At that point, both sides reset at zero and begin accumulating and paying the next cycle of earnings of $1,200. Because this bonus is calculated and paid weekly, the maximum earnings potential of an Income Center is $1,200 per week. Each Associate's Income Center qualifies, accumulates, pays and resets independently of all other Income Centers.</P>

<P>An Associate must generate $90 PWV prior to the Friday following the last day of the calendar month or the last day of the month if that day is a Friday. If an Associate fails to achieve $90 PWV by that date, all their accumulated volume in each Income Center will be zeroed out and no volume in each Income Center will accumulate until the Associate places an order for at least $90 PWV. At that point, they are eligible to begin accumulating new volume and earning the binary bonus again.</TD>

<LI>Although most people think <B>carbohydrates</B> are innocent with respect to weight gain, it does <B>get stored as fat</B> in the adipose tissue. </LI>
<LI>Although most people think they should eat a high-carbohydrate meal before they exercise, the resulting high-levels of insulin in the blood stream create a situation where stored fat can NOT (or with increased difficulty) be converted back to energy (burned). In addition, this process makes the body rely on ingested carbohydrates (in short supply) rather than use the stored energy through a buffering process. </LI>
<LI>High-carbohydrate meals <B>excessively stimulate the pancreas</B>. The usual resulting conditions are known as hypoglycemia in the first stages (moodiness, &quot;need to eat&quot;, shakiness when empty stomach, addiction for more carbohydrates, mood swings, etc.), and pancreas exhaustion later on, therefore leading to diabetes (no more insulin secreted by the pancreas. Must be injected manually). </LI>
<LI>Once you start consuming high-carbohydrate meals, you will go through what is referred to as the <B>&quot;yo-yo&quot; effect</B>. High-level of glucose in the blood stream call for heavy insulin secretion, which in turn has all chances to be over-reactive. As a result, the blood sugar level goes down under the normal level, causing your system, in state of deprivation, to ask for more and make you crave carbohydrates. You will then snack on a candy bar and the cycle starts over... This succession of highs and lows can often be observed in people around you and is frequently attributed to bad mood swings, PMS or simply an unstable personality... </LI>
<LI>Insulin has other negative effects that affect other areas of your metabolism, mood, blood pressure and arteries.</LI>
<LI>Foods with a high <A HREF="./glycemic_index.html">glycemic index</A> are foods that release glucose into the bloodstream quickly.&nbsp; Releasing glucose too fast&nbsp; will get a fast high but fast crash of blood sugar level.&nbsp; Releasing glucose at a slower rate can provide the body with a steady stream of energy.&nbsp; High glycemic foods can result in overproduction of insulin and eventual fat storage.</LI>
<LI>Eating high-carbohydrate diets can include carbohydrate addiction and yeast infections or candidiasis. <B>Candida</B> overgrowth in the intestines can cause chronic vaginal yeast infections as well as many other symptoms such as fatigue, sinus infections, headaches, gastrointestinal discomfort and bloating, earaches and infections.</TD>

<P>The two hormones, <B>insulin</B> and <B>glucagon</B> play a vital roll in weight loss and weight gain.&nbsp; Contrary to the idea that you can eat more and weigh less, the more you eat foods that stimulate insulin and suppress glucagon (ie. carbohydrates) the more body fat your body is going to store.&nbsp; So to balance this out, your diet must contain the appropriate amount of protein and complex carbohydrates to allow the insulin and glucagon to be secreted in proportionate amounts and work synergistic in using the consumed food for energy (burning the calories instead of storing them).</P>
<P>If you want to utilize more fats, the best advice is to minimize the insulin response by limiting your intake of <A HREF="./glycemic_index.html">refined sugars</A> and carbohydrates, which includes all sweets, non-100% whole grain breads, cereals and pasta, keeping all your carbohydrate intake to about 40% of the diet. Even certain natural foods, such as dried fruit, potatoes, honey and fruit juices are very high in carbohydrates. Keeping carbohydrates to 40% will help keep your blood sugar more stable, give you more energy and less cravings. More importantly, you will <B>lose body fat</B>. </TD>

<P><B>Eat more Proteins </B></P>
<P>Another important building block of the human body is protein.&nbsp; It is essential for tissue growth and repair and for forming neurotransmitters in the brain.&nbsp; It boosts the metabolic rate, enhances the immune system and provides the necessary amino acids to the body.&nbsp; When protein is increased in the diet, the body forms new muscle.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Protein's most specific function is to stimulate the production of the hormone <A HREF="./so_what_.html">Glucagon</A>.&nbsp; Glucagon's job is to open up the cells of the stored fat already in the body for use as a fuel source.&nbsp; What this means is that eating protein in the form of poultry, fish and red meat actually helps us lose weight by allowing our bodies to burn off its stored fat.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Protein raises the metabolic rate, which will give you more energy and endurance.&nbsp; </P>
<P>A diet of 40% carbohydrate and 30% <A HREF="./fats.html">fat</A>, leaving 30% for protein, is an excellent balance for many people who seek not only good health, but quality modification since individual needs may vary.</TD>

<UL TYPE="DISC">
<LI><B>What They Are</B></LI>
<LI><B>How They Work</B></LI>
<LI><B>Why You Need Them</B></LI>
</UL>
<P><B>What they are<BR></B>Vitamins are organic micro-nutrients that act like spark plugs in the body, keeping it &quot;tuned up&quot;, and functioning at high performance. But you cannot live on vitamins. They are not pep pills or substitutes for food. </P>
<P><B>How they work<BR></B>Vitamins are not the components of body structure. They stimulate, but do not act as, nutritional fuel. As catalysts, they work on the cellular level, often as co-enzymes, regulating body metabolic processes through enzyme activity, to convert proteins and carbohydrates to tissue and energy. Notwithstanding their minute size and amount in the body, vitamins are absolutely necessary for growth, vitality, resistance to disease, and healthy aging. Even small deficiencies can endanger the whole body. Unfortunately, it takes weeks or months for signs of some deficiencies to appear as the body uses up its supply, and even then a problem is often hard to pinpoint, because the cells usually continue to function at less and less efficiency until they receive proper nourishment or suffer irreversible damage.</P>
<P>Vitamin therapy and supplementation do not produce results overnight. Vitamins fill the nutrition gap at the deepest levels of the body processes. Regenerative changes in body chemistry usually require as much time to rebuild as they did to decline.</P>
<P>Even though it is impossible to sustain life without them, most vitamins cannot be synthesized by the body, and must be supplied from foods or supplementation. Excess amounts are excreted through the urine, or stored by the body until needed. </P>
<P><B>Why you need them<BR></B>Vitamin RDAs were established by the National Academy years ago as a guideline for the amounts of vitamins and minerals needed to prevent the most severe deficiency diseases. Today, because of poor dietary habits, over-processed foods, and agri-business practices, most health professionals recognize that supplemental amounts are often needed to achieve adequate nutrition and health. A recent USDA survey of the food intake of 21,500 people over a three day period showed that not a single person consumed 100% of the RDA for the nutrients surveyed. Only 3% ate the recommended number of servings from the four food groups. Only 12% of those surveyed ate the RDA for protein, calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc or vitamins A, C, B6, B12, B2, and B1. More importantly, the study noted that focusing solely on efforts to change dietary habits and discounting supplementation as a valuable option, leaves much of the population at nutritional risk, In fact, no dietary survey to date has shown that all recommended RDA nutrient intakes are being consumed through the daily diet.</P>
<P>As we age, vitamins can be particularly valuable aids to health maintenance of both body and mind. Antioxidants are especially needed in our diet.&nbsp; These nutrients work to block the oxidizing process in the body, a process that otherwise causes the production of free radicals, which damage and age our cells.&nbsp; Free radicals are caused by normal body processes as well as environmental factors such as radiation, tobacco, smoke, pesticides, food additives, air and water pollution.&nbsp; Good sources of antioxidants are vitamin C, vitamin E and beta carotene.&nbsp; </TD>

<P><B>The myth of burning fat</B></P>
<P>Current mythology has it that the only way to burn fat is through aerobic exercise. Guess what? Once again the current &quot;wisdom&quot; is wrong. Although anaerobic exercise (weight lifting) doesn't access fat directly, it still has a powerful indirect effect on the fat-burning process. </P>
<P>What is that effect? If the intensity of the anaerobic workout is high enough, it causes the body to release human growth hormone.&nbsp; This potent hormone has a number of important jobs in the body, one of which is to repair the microdamage done to muscle tissue during anaerobic exercise. </P>
<P>It takes a lot of energy to do the repair job, and that energy comes from your stored body fat. This means that, in effect, human growth hormone is the most powerful fat-burning hormone in the body. So release of human growth hormone from the pituitary gland is the crucial hormonal change that occurs with anaerobic exercise. That hormonal change gives you two important benefits: it burns fat, and it allows you to build new muscle at the same time.</P>
<P>There is one other time that human growth hormone is released, and it has nothing to do with training. It's released during sleep; actually during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. This is the time in which your body repairs itself for the next day of operation. The better the quality of your sleep, the more growth hormone will be released during your sleep.</P>
<P>So how do you maximize growth hormone release during sleep? Take <A HREF="http://www.4BetterHealth.com/calorad/">Calorad</A> before you retire. This will set in motion the hormonal foundation to allow maximum secretion of growth hormone. Thus allowing your body to build lean muscle tissue, which in turn allows you to burn your body fat. All while you sleep.&nbsp; </P>
<P>On the other hand, if you eat a carbohydrate-rich snack before you go to bed, you've done everything in your power to inhibit growth hormone release, and therefore inhibit the building of lean muscle tissue and burning of fat. Why? Because you've raised insulin levels, and insulin retards the secretion of growth hormone from the pituitary gland.&nbsp; So the best way to insure that you secrete growth hormone to burn fat, during the REM stage of sleep, is to have an empty stomach before you retire.&nbsp; </P>
<P>This means not eating 3 hours before bed.&nbsp; And then take <A HREF="http://www.4BetterHealth.com/calorad/">Calorad</A>.</TD>

<P><B>Supplementation: The need for it </B></P>
<P>In a perfect world, food can be our sole source of nutrition. Nature was designed to provide us with all the nutrients that we need in the form of food. A well-balanced diet should be all it takes to feed your body well, and promote good health and vitality.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, things are not the way they used to be anymore. The severe industrialization of the modern world, industrial farming and mass-production have generated a situation where the exhausted soil can not furnish enough of those nutrients for us to absorb through our normal diets.</P>
<P>It is time to wake-up to these rude facts: we simply often can not find enough nutrients in the foods we get in our stores.</P>
<P>Supplemental vitamins and minerals are very much a necessity in our diets.&nbsp; They help to combat stress and provide support for all aspects of the human biology.&nbsp; Since our soil is depleted of most minerals and vitamins, we have a tough time getting what we need from the foods we eat.</TD>

<P>Because each of our bodies are unique you should be concerned about general dietary guidelines.&nbsp; For example, the <A HREF="./vitamins.html">vitamin</A> and mineral Recommended Daily Allowances (RDAs) or the optimum number of calories and <A HREF="./fats.html">fat</A> grams a person should consume.&nbsp; If you think about it, just how much alike in body mass, bone structure, physical energy, shape and size are you when compared to anyone else???</P>
<P>You may have noticed that even within the same family, or with your friends, that someone might be able to consume just about anything and not gain a pound and for you just looking at the food puts on weight.&nbsp; This is due to your biochemical individuality.</TD>

<P><B>Slow oxidizers and fast oxidizers</B></P>
<P>This refers to the relative speed at which a person is able to utilize nutrients for energy, such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.&nbsp; Both types can have problems trying to keep their weight down and energy level constant. </P>
<P>To create energy your body also requires very specific minerals and <A HREF="./vitamins.html">vitamins</A> at every stage of energy production.&nbsp; If you are a slow oxidizer or a fast oxidizer due to your own specific set of vitamin and mineral deficiencies, you will not utilize energy efficiently.&nbsp; For a slow oxidizer, you burn food too slowly and therefore can feel lethargic and sluggish and gain weight easily.&nbsp; For a fast oxidizer you burn food too quickly, especially carbohydrates, and may feel hyped up, nervous and easily stressed. Fast oxidizers usually will have low blood sugar and can tend to be hypoglycemic.&nbsp; </P>
<P>What is important for both the slow and fast oxidizer is that you will need protein to stabilize your blood sugar levels.&nbsp; Fast oxidizers can eat the heavier, <A HREF="./proteins.html">proteins</A> such as red meat, and cold-water fish daily.&nbsp; The slow oxidizer will usually not handle fat well, and should stick to the leaner proteins, such as white-meat chicken or turkey and fish.</TD>

<P>Most of us are becoming ill and <A HREF="./low_bandwidth_html/weight_loss.html">overweight</A> because of poor eating habits or just from eating the average American diet.&nbsp; Adding to that too much stress and not enough rest can really create havoc for your body.</P>
<P>The average American diet consists of non-vitalized, processed, over-cooked foods which have been robbed of their original nutritional value. Unless you are enjoying good health and eating mostly raw fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts and seeds, as well as cutting down on stress, exercising and getting proper rest, chances are you have headaches, backaches, leg aches, chest pains, tiredness, overweight and are just plain &quot;burned out&quot;.</P>
<P>The sad truth is that <B>Americans are getting fatter</B>.&nbsp; A recent study by scientists at the National Center for Health Statistics in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that the number of <B>overweight adults</B> in America has <B>increased 32%</B> in the last ten years.</P>
<P>It is human nature to oppose change, and we will think of all kinds of excuses why we shouldn't.&nbsp; It is a well known fact that most of us take better care of our automobiles than we do of ourselves. If we put &quot;junk fuel&quot; in our auto it begins to knock, ping and act sluggish. It only stands to reason, if we put &quot;junk fuel&quot; in our bodies, the same thing occurs. The old adage, <B>&quot;You Are What You Eat&quot;</B> is very true.</TD>

<P>Fifteen years ago, scientists at <A HREF="http://www.carringtonlabs.com/">Carrington Laboratories</A> discovered a significant phytochemical in fresh aloe, which is called a <B>betamannan</B>.&nbsp; Within hours of cutting a fresh aloe leaf, that natural enzyme the betamannan breaks down into simple sugars which DESTROYS its functional capacity.&nbsp; The scientists' developed a processing method that (1) deactivates the destructive enzyme and (2) stabilizes the functional component, called a betamannon in the fresh cut aloe vera plant.&nbsp; And through a freeze-drying dehydration process, they make this into a powder.&nbsp;&nbsp; The final product of the patented process is trademarked <B>Manapol<FONT SIZE="-1"></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000">, the only nutraceutical-grade aloe vera extract with a scientifically standardized level of aloe betamannans.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;Researchers from <A HREF="http://www.carringtonlabs.com/">Carrington Laboratories</A> spent tens of millions of dollars to discover, stabilize and standardize a unique labile polysaccharide (betamannan molecule) in fresh aloe vera that scientists world-wide believe is responsible for its unprecedented reputation. Carrington has over 66 patents worldwide on the processing technique, composition of matter and pharmaceutical uses, making it one of the most secure and effective functional food products to enter this new market. In 1995, Carrington licensed the rights to Manapol to <A HREF="./low_bandwidth_html/mannatech.html">Mannatech International</A>. Mannatech is the clear leader in this newly emerging field.</TD>

<P>Look around you: everybody is living on high-carbohydrate, low-fat foods. It is supposed to be the key to good health promoted by the masses. This is very misleading and is actually making people very sick, in a very insidious way.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Despite eating less fat, <B>Americans are fatter than ever</B>. Why?&nbsp; Because <B>fat does not make you fat</B>, insulin does.&nbsp; There are two ways to increase insulin:</P>
<UL TYPE="DISC">
<LI>Eat too much food at any one meal, or</LI>
<LI>Eat too many carbohydrates</LI>
</UL>
<P>What most people do not realize is that the most commonly consumed carbohydrates (like pasta, bagels, breads and potatoes) actually quickly release sugar into the bloodstream and then, if not immediately used, this sugar is turned into <B>BODY FAT!!</B>&nbsp; Your body only has a limited amount of storage space for excess carbohydrates.&nbsp; It has, however, a limitless ability to turn excess carbohydrates into fat.</P>
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>When eating a high-carbohydrate meal, the level of glucose in the blood stream augments (more or less, based on the glycemic quality of the ingested carbohydrate.&nbsp; The <A HREF="./glycemic_index.html">glycemic index</A>&nbsp; is the rate at which a carbohydrate breaks down to be released as glucose into the bloodstream).</LI>
<LI>This augmentation triggers the secretion of insulin from the pancreas. The purpose of insulin is to carry the glucose through the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm of the cells for metabolism and use for energy. </LI>
<LI>Whatever glucose is not immediately consumed is converted into glycogen (glycogen synthesis), a stored form of energy used for later retrieval. </LI>
<LI>Glycogen is stored in the liver, the muscles and the spleen in limited amounts. The rest of available glucose gets stored in the adipose tissue (stored fat) where it is converted to fatty acids and then tryglicerides. </LI>
<LI>Insulin inhibits the breakdown of glycogen and tryglicerides back to glucose. </LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Add The Essential Fats </B></P>
<P>Eating enough dietary fats is also an important consideration for anyone wanting to burn more fat and spare sugar. The only real &quot;bad&quot; fats in the diet are the artificial ones, like margarine and other hydrogenated fats, and fried or over-heated fats. All natural fats are good for your body as long as you consume them in moderation and you have healthy metabolism.</P>
<P>For most people this means about 30% of the diet can be fats, but they should be a balance of omega-6, omega-3 and, if your eat them, animal fats. Omega-6 fats are found in vegetables and most vegetable oils such as extra virgin olive and safflower. Omega-3 fats can be found in fish, beans, and linseed (flaxseed) oil. If you don't eat animal foods, some omega-3 or -6 fats will convert to arachidonic acid, the fat found in animal products. Good dietary sources of animal fats include butter, egg yolks, cheese and all meats including beef. A balance of these three fat groups will provide you with enough fats for a healthy lean body.&nbsp; Eating essential fatty acids (such as omega-3 oils and omega-6 oils) can help you become thin.&nbsp; EFAs move other fats, including the bad LDL cholesterol, out of the body.</P>
<P>Fat makes a wonderful source of energy.&nbsp; It levels out blood sugar.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some fat in the diet is necessary to assist the process of burning off stored fat.&nbsp; Dietary fats are one of the best ways to stimulate your metabolism, which is what you want to do if you goal is to increase fat burning. A fast metabolism converts fat to energy quicker.</P>
<P>Fat can also keep your appetite satisfied for up to six hours at a time.</P>
<P>You must not feel guilty about eating the correct kind of fat.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your health will suffer from it and you will have trouble losing weight.</TD>

<P>Mannatech's proprietary blend of <B>Dioscorea</B> (Mexican Wild Yam) and <B>Ambrotose</B> provides unique building blocks for the body's production of prohormones. Enhanced prohormone production can aid the body in its burning of fat, recovery from exercise, energy production and regulation of metabolism. No other product contains these unique components.</TD>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0C5537">METABOLIC PROFILING &amp; FOODFORM&reg;</B></FONT></P>
<P>Clearly, a well-balanced diet is important to health.&nbsp; But what constitutes a well-balanced diet?&nbsp; Nutritional supplementation is very necessary.&nbsp; How do you know what to take for your body type?</P>
<P>There are three areas that play a roll in your metabolic profile:</P>
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI><B>Autonomic System</B>, controls all involuntary activity in the body: digestion, elimination, heart beat and immune activity.&nbsp; It is comprised of two divisions:&nbsp; Sympathetic and Parasympathetic.</LI>
<LI><B>The Oxidative System</B> is concerned with the rate at which nutrients are converted to energy in the cells through a process called oxidation.</LI>
<LI><B>The Endocrine System</B> exerts it influence on cellular metabolism through the secretion of hormones which regulate various activities in the body.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Genetically, each person has inherited various strengths and weaknesses in each of these systems.&nbsp; So the key is to determine a well-balanced diet or supplement plan for your body type that will support your strengths and strengthen your weaknesses to help balance your body's energy-producing systems.</P>
<P>Research has now provided the most scientifically based system of metabolic profiling and nutritional suppplementation available.&nbsp; To obtain a copy of this Metabolic Profile Survey so that you can determine YOUR body type, send us an email with your mailing address.&nbsp; This Profile Survey will help you to figure out which metabolically profiled multi-vitamin is right for your body.&nbsp; And it also gives you dietary recommendations as to which foods your body type will work best with.</P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0C5537">FOODFORM&reg;<BR></FONT></B>Once you have determined the metabolically profiled nutritional formulas, by taking the Profile Survey, the next step is to supply the body with the raw materials (vitamins and minerals) it can utilize effectively.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0C5537">What's Wrong with Ordinary Vitamin/Mineral Supplements?<BR></FONT>Contrary to what vitamin companies would like you to believe, the truth is that the vitamins and minerals in supplements are not the same as the vitamins and minerals in food.&nbsp; The ingredients are what is known as &quot;USP&quot; (United States Pharmacopoeia) vitamins.&nbsp; That means simply that they are isolated pharmaceutical chemicals.&nbsp; And the minerals are mined from the ground!</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0C5537">Vitamins-Supplements vs. Food<BR></FONT>For example, vitamin B-6 in supplements is pyridoxine hydrochloride, a s synthetic USP chemical.&nbsp; Not at all like the vitamin B-6 in food.&nbsp; The vitamins in food are in a highly-complex form we call the &quot;food matrix&quot; which our bodies recognize and utilize.&nbsp; This food matrix contains proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, bioflavonoids and other food factors.</P>
<P>The USP vitamins in supplements are not in a food matrix.&nbsp; They are isolated chemicals which your cells cannot recognize and utilize properly.&nbsp; Your body does the best it can to absorb a small amount, but most is excreted.&nbsp; The cells of your body were designed by nature to be nourished by the vitamins in natural foods, not by pharmaceutical chemicals.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0C5537">Minerals-Supplements vs Food<BR></FONT>All minerals originally come from the ground.&nbsp; Food grows in the ground.&nbsp; The minerals come up from the soil through the roots, and are transformed inside the plant cells into complex structures our bodies can utilize.&nbsp; They become part of the living plant tissue- part of the food matrix.&nbsp; That's why the iron in broccoli doesn't look like the iron in your car.&nbsp; But in supplements, the USP minerals are not food, they are rocks and metals mined from the ground.</P>
<P>For example, look at calcium supplements.&nbsp; Calcium carbonate is limestone; calcium sulfate is plaster and calcium phosphate is chalk.&nbsp; If we could assimilate rocks and metals from the ground, we wouldn't need to grow food! </P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0C5537">What about the SO-CALLED &quot;food-based&quot; vitamin/mineral supplements?<BR></FONT>&quot;Natural&quot; or &quot;Food-based&quot; supplements are formulated with the same USP chemical vitamins and minerals.&nbsp; The problem is they are still not recognizable to your body.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0C5537">FOODFORM&reg; Vitamins - The real thing<BR></FONT></B>IntraCell Nutrition Inc. 14 years ago helped to solve the problem of not eating right.&nbsp; Their team of researchers developed processes for converting USP vitamins and minerals into complex, natural forms your body can recognize and accept as food, to nourish your cells, without the toxicity of ordinary vitamins and minerals.</P>
<P>Many studies have proven that FOODFORM vitamins and minerals may be better absorbed, retained and utilized than the isolated USP forms.&nbsp; These FOODFORM vitamins will not upset your stomach like ordinary vitamins.&nbsp; You don't even have to take them with meals.&nbsp; Take them any time, even on an empty stomach.</P>
<P>Even if you try to eat right/healthy, it is difficult.&nbsp; That is why FOODFORM vitamins and minerals are so important to give our cells the nourishment we need to combat our fast paced lifestyles, polluted environments and long work hours.</TD>

<P>Each Income Center has two sides, a left and a right. Once the Income Center is permanently qualified, BV is accumulated on each side as sales are made. A $200 bonus is paid when both sides each accumulate $1,000 BV. This process of accumulation and pay is continued until the Income Center has earned a total of $1,200. At that point, both sides reset at zero and begin accumulating and paying the next cycle of earnings of $1,200. Because this bonus is calculated and paid weekly, the maximum earnings potential of an Income Center is $1,200 per week. Each Associate's Income Center qualifies, accumulates, pays and resets independently of all other Income Centers.</P>

<P>An Associate must generate $90 PWV prior to the Friday following the last day of the calendar month or the last day of the month if that day is a Friday. If an Associate fails to achieve $90 PWV by that date, all their accumulated volume in each Income Center will be zeroed out and no volume in each Income Center will accumulate until the Associate places an order for at least $90 PWV. At that point, they are eligible to begin accumulating new volume and earning the binary bonus again.</TD>
