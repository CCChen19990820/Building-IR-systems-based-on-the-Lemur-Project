               MOTION FOR EXPEDITED CONSIDERATION
                   AND FOR BRIEFING SCHEDULE


     Appellant United States of America hereby moves for
expedited consideration of this appeal and to establish a
briefing schedule.      On February 14, 1995, Judge Stanley
Sporkin signed an order refusing to enter the proposed Final
Judgment reached in this action by the United States and
Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft").  In the Order and
accompanying Opinion, Judge Sporkin misconstrued the permissible
scope of his review under the Tunney Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(b)-(h),
and thereby erroneously rejected a consent decree that
undoubtedly met the Act's "public interest" test and that was
supported by an affidavit submitted by Nobel prize winning
economist Professor Kenneth J. Arrow. Moreover, Judge Sporkin's
opinion makes clear that, before entering the decree, he would
require the government to reveal to the court all aspects of its
investigation of Microsoft, including the government's reasons
for every decision that it made in performing its Executive
Branch functions, details concerning conduct the government has
not at this point challenged, and the government's plans for
further action against the defendant.  The district court's
decision, unprecedented in the history of the Tunney Act,
radically alters the nature of Tunney Act review of proposed
consent decrees.  By so doing, it threatens the ongoing
enforcement program of the Antitrust Division, which relies
heavily on achieving consent decrees with antitrust defendants.
For these reasons, expedited review by this Court is necessary to
ensure that the Antitrust Division's enforcement program does not
suffer immediate and irredeemable harm.

                            ARGUMENT

     A party seeking expedited consideration generally "must
demonstrate the delay will cause irreparable injury and that the
decision under review is subject to substantial challenge"; but
"[t]he Court may also expedite cases . . . in which the public
generally [has] an unusual interest in prompt disposition" and
the reasons are "strongly compelling."  U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit, Handbook of Practice and
Internal Procedures 40 (1987).  Each of these tests is met here.

I.   THE DISTRICT COURT'S DECISION IS SQUARELY WRONG

     Judge Sporkin's Opinion in this case transforms the Tunney
Act into a blueprint for judicial prosecution of antitrust cases.
The Opinion's legal failings are legion, and it is not the
government's purpose to besiege the Court in this motion with
arguments properly reserved for a merits brief.  The district
court, however, committed at least three fundamental errors.   
First, the court erroneously concluded that the Tunney Act
permits a court to review the history of the government's
investigation (including related investigations), the
government's decision not to challenge particular practices at
the time that a consent decree is negotiated, and its intentions
to challenge uncharged conduct in the future.  As a consequence,
the court has sent the message to antitrust defendants that
agreeing to a consent decree with the government will open up the
entire range of that party's conduct to judicial scrutiny,
whether or not that conduct is related to the government's
concerns as set forth in the complaint before the court, and
whether or not the government has decided to challenge that
conduct at the time that the decree is negotiated.  The Tunney
Act, however, never was intended to substitute the court's views
of what case to bring for the government's.      Second, the
court departed from settled Tunney Act precedent by failing to
limit its consideration of the antitrust consequences of the
decree to whether the relief sought in the proposed Final
Judgment adequately remedies the violations set forth in the
complaint.  Indeed, the court condemned the decree because it did
not dissipate market power acquired through lawful conduct and
because it did not address antitrust concerns in markets not even
alleged in the complaint.  In the process, the court flat out
rejected, without justification, Professor Arrow's conclusion
that the practices challenged by the government did not
materially augment Microsoft's "installed base" of users, and his
considered judgment that, as a consequence, the decree
appropriately remedied the violation alleged by ensuring that
Microsoft does not continue the challenged practices in the
future.      Third, Judge Sporkin improperly departed from the
principle that he must defer to the policy and litigation
judgments of the Department of Justice, as well as its expertise,
see, e.g., United States v. Western Elec. Co., 993 F.2d 1572,
1576-77 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 487 (1993), by
impermissibly measuring the proposed Final Judgment against his
own vision of an ideal decree.  In so doing, the court failed to
pay heed to Judge Greene's admonition that "[i]f courts acting
under the Tunney Act disapproved proposed consent decrees merely
because they did not contain the exact relief which the court
would have imposed after a finding of liability, defendants would
have no incentive to consent to judgment . . . .  The consent
decree would thus as a practical matter be eliminated as an
antitrust enforcement tool, despite Congress' directive that it
be preserved."  United States v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 552 F.
Supp. 131, 151 (D.D.C. 1982), aff'd sub nom. Maryland v. United
States, 460 U.S. 1001 (1983).

II.  THE COURT'S DECISION WILL IRREPARABLY HARM THE PUBLIC   
INTEREST IN EFFECTIVE ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT

     These errors, and others, threaten the government's ongoing
enforcement program.  The consent decree, which conserves the
resources both of enforcement agencies and the courts, is a vital
tool of antitrust law enforcement.  Indeed, from August 1993
through September 1994, the Division filed, on average,
approximately two decrees per month.  That figure has risen to
almost three per month for the period of October 1994 through
January 1995.      That record of success is threatened while
Judge Sporkin's ruling stands, for its inevitable effect is to
deter parties from entering into consent judgments.  Both
potential defendants and the government will balk at entering
into consent decrees if, as Judge Sporkin has held, to gain court
approval, the government must reveal to the court all aspects of
its investigation.  If this were not enough, according to Judge
Sporkin, a Tunney Act court may reject a decree both because the
government has not brought the case that the court would like
brought or has not required a defendant to surrender competitive
advantages that did not result from the violations alleged and
which are not necessary to excise in order to craft an effective
antitrust remedy for those violations.  A defendant confronted
with the choice of litigating against the government or acceding
to these demands clearly would find the former more inviting.   
As a consequence, as long as Judge Sporkin's decision stands,
scarce government resources likely will be wasted litigating
cases that it otherwise would settle and settle appropriately,
and those resources will not be available to investigate or
prosecute other antitrust offenses.  Obviously, no remedy can
repair the resulting harm to the public interest. Thus, the
public has an unusual and compelling interest at stake. Antitrust
enforcement serves the public interest.                            
* * *   In addition to the above, the United States notes that it
perfected its notice of appeal the day after Judge Sporkin's
order was entered.  The United States, moreover, is prepared to
submit its opening brief within 21 days from the entry of a
briefing order.

                           CONCLUSION

     In sum, the Tunney Act does not authorize a court to perform
the Executive function of deciding whether the government should
have brought a different antitrust case.  Judge Sporkin's
contrary ruling raises the specter that, when an antitrust
defendant negotiates a proposed consent decree with the Division,
it will do no more than open up the entire range of that party's
conduct to judicial scrutiny.  The court was wrong, its errors
are potentially devastating to efficient enforcement of the law,
and expedited review is essential.

     For the foregoing reasons, the motion to grant expedited
consideration and to set a briefing schedule should be granted.   
Respectfully submitted.

STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION
        Defendant-Appellant Microsoft
Corporation ("Microsoft") appeals from two Orders of the
District Court (Hon. Stanley Sporkin):
(i)    refusing to enter a consent decree, agreed to by
Microsoft and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of
Justice (the "DOJ"), pursuant to the Tunney Act, 15 U.S.C. 
16(b)-(h) (J.A. 1190-91); and
(ii)    permitting certain unnamed software companies (the
"putative amici") and the Computer & Communications
Industry Association ("CCIA") to participate in the proceedings
below pursuant to 15 U.S.C.   16(f)(3) (J.A. 1192-93).
The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction over this
matter pursuant to Section 4 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.   4,
and 28 U.S.C.    1331 and 1337. The District Court issued the
Orders appealed from on February 14, 1995 (J.A. 1190, 1192),
and Microsoft filed a timely Notice of Appeal on February 16,
1995 (J.A. 1271). See 28 U.S.C.   2107(b).
        This Court has jurisdiction over
Microsoft's appeal from the Order refusing to enter the consent
decree pursuant to 28 U.S.C.   1292(a)(1) because the Order
denies an injunction. The Supreme Court held that the refusal
to enter a consent decree providing for injunctive relief is
appealable under Section 1292(a)(1) if such refusal (i) "might
have a serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence" and (ii) "can
be effectively challenged only by immediate appeal." Carson v.
American Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 83-84 (1981) (internal
quotation omitted). The Order refusing to enter the consent
decree has the "serious, perhaps irreparable consequence" of
denying Microsoft and the DOJ "their right to compromise
their dispute on mutually agreeable terms," instead subjecting
them to "the costs and uncertainties of litigation." Id. at 87-88.
The Order also "can be effectively challenged only by
immediate appeal" because the opportunity for Microsoft and
the DOJ to settle the case will be irretrievably lost if they are
forced to litigate to final judgment.1

        This Court has jurisdiction over
Microsoft's appeal from the District Court's Order permitting
the putative amici and CCIA to participate in the Tunney Act
proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C.   1291 under the collateral
order doctrine of Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337
U.S. 541 (1949). See Kimbro v. Velten, 30 F.3d 1501, 1503
(D.C. Cir. 1994), petition for cert. filed, __ U.S.L.W. ____
(U.S. Nov. 1, 1994) (No. 94-6703). The Supreme Court held in
Cohen that an otherwise non-final order is appealable under
Section 1291 if it "(1) conclusively determine[s] the disputed
question, (2) resolve[s] an important question completely
separate from the merits of the action, and (3) [is] effectively
unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment." United States
v. Weissberger, 951 F.2d 392, 396 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (internal
quotation omitted).
        The Order permitting the putative amici
and CCIA to participate in the Tunney Act proceeding satisfies
this test. First, the Order conclusively determined that the
putative amici and CCIA could participate, over the strenuous
objection of Microsoft and the DOJ (see J.A. 615, 625).
Second, the Order resolved an issue that is both important _
whether persons who flout the requirements of the Tunney Act
and fundamental principles of due process can participate in the
review of a consent decree, thereby preventing its timely entry
_ and is completely separate from the merits, i.e., whether
Microsoft violated the antitrust laws. Third, participation by the
putative amici and CCIA in the proceeding below would be
effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. By
that time, a settlement that provides the DOJ with more relief
than it could obtain if it prevailed on the merits after trial
(see
J.A. 201 & n.2) would have been lost as a direct result of the
putative amici's and CCIA's interference.

ISSUES PRESENTED FOR REVIEW
        1.    Did the District Court err
in refusing to enter the consent decree by reason of (a) the
scope of review it employed, (b) the scope of disclosure it
required, and (c) the substantive standard of review it applied,
all under the Tunney Act?
        2.    Did the District Court err
in conducting its review under the Tunney Act as a result of
multiple procedural and substantive errors of law, including (a)
reliance on extrajudicial sources of information, (b) acceptance
of belated submissions from persons who filed nothing during
the statutory 60-day comment period, (c) authorization of
individuals to participate in the proceeding on an anonymous
basis, and (d) fundamental mistakes as to the requirements of
the antitrust laws?

STATUTE CONSTRUED
Tunney Act, 15 U.S.C.   16(b)-(h)
(b)    Consent judgments and competitive impact statements;
publication in Federal Register; availability of copies to the
public
        Any proposal for a consent judgment
submitted by the United States for entry in any civil proceeding
brought by or on behalf of the United States under the antitrust
laws shall be filed with the district court before which such
proceeding is pending and published by the United States in the
Federal Register at least 60 days prior to the effective date of
such judgment. Any written comments relating to such
proposal and any responses by the United States thereto, shall
also be filed with such district court and published by the
United States in the Federal Register within such sixty-day
period. Copies of such proposal and any other materials and
documents which the United States considered determinative in
formulating such proposal, shall also be made available to the
public at the district court and in such other districts as the
court may subsequently direct. Simultaneously with the filing
of such proposal, unless otherwise instructed by the court, the
United States shall file with the district court, publish in the
Federal Register, and thereafter furnish to any person upon
request, a competitive impact states which shall recite _
        (1)    the nature and purpose of
the proceeding;
        (2)    a description of the
practices or events giving rise to the alleged violation of the
antitrust laws;
        (3)    an explanation of the
proposal for a consent judgment, including an explanation of
any unusual circumstances giving rise to such proposal or any
provision contained therein, relief to be obtained thereby, and
the anticipated effects on competition of such relief;
        (4)    the remedies available to
potential private plaintiffs damaged by the alleged violation in
the event that such proposal for the consent judgment is entered
in such proceeding;
        (5)    a description of the
procedures available for modification of such proposal; and
        (6)    a description and
evaluation of alternatives to such proposal actually considered

(c)    Publication of summaries in newspapers
        The United States shall also cause to be
published, commencing at least 60 days prior to the effective
date of the judgment described in subsection (b) of this section,
for 7 days over a period of 2 weeks in newspapers of general
circulation of the district in which the case has been filed, in
the District of Columbia, and in such other districts as the court
may direct _
        (i)    a summary of the terms of
the proposal for the consent judgment,
        (ii)    a summary of the
competitive impact statement filed under subsection (b) of this
section,
        (iii)    and a list of the materials
and documents under subsection (b) of this section which the
United States shall make available for purposes of meaningful
public comment, and the place where such materials and
documents are available for public inspection.
(d)    Consideration of public comments by Attorney General
and publication of response
        During the 60-day period as specified in
subsection (b) of this section, and such additional time as the
United States may request and the court may grant, the United
States shall receive and consider any written comments relating
to the proposal for the consent judgment submitted under
subsection (b) of this section. The Attorney General or his
designee shall establish procedures to carry out the provisions
of this subsection, but such 60-day time period shall not be
shortened except by order of the district court upon a showing
that (1) extraordinary circumstances require such shortening
and (2) such shortening is not adverse to the public interest. At
the close of the period during which such comments may be
received, the United States shall file with the district court and
cause to be published in the Federal Register a response to such
comments.
(e)    Public interest determination
        Before entering any consent judgment
proposed by the United States under this section, the court shall
determine that the entry of such judgment is in the public
interest. For the purpose of such determination, the court may
consider _
        (1)    the competitive impact of
such judgment, including termination of alleged violations,
provisions for enforcement and modification, duration or relief
sought, anticipated effects of alternative remedies actually
considered, and any other considerations bearing upon the
adequacy of such judgment;
        (2)    the impact of entry of such
judgment upon the public generally and individuals alleging
specific injury from the violations set forth in the complaint
including consideration of the public benefit, if any, to be
derived from a determination of the issues at trial.
(f)    Procedure for public interest determination
        In making its determination under
subsection (e) of this section, the court may _
        (1)    take testimony of
Government officials or experts or such other expert witnesses,
upon motion of any party or participant or upon its own
motion, as the court may deem appropriate;
        (2)    appoint a special master
and such outside consultants or expert witnesses as the court
may deem appropriate; and request and obtain the views,
evaluations, or advice of any individual, group or agency of
government with respect to any aspects of the proposed
judgment or the effect of such judgment, in such manner as the
court deems appropriate;
        (3)    authorize full or limited
participation in proceedings before the court by interested
persons or agencies, including appearance amicus curiae,
intervention as a party pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, examination of witnesses or documentary materials,
or participation in any other manner and extent which serves
the public interest as the court may deem appropriate;
        (4)    review any comments
including any objections filed with the United States under
subsection (d) of this section concerning the proposed
judgment and the responses of the United States to such
comments and objections; and
        (5)    take such other action in
the public interest as the court may deem appropriate.
(g)    Filing of written or oral communications with the
district court
        Not later than 10 days following the date
of the filing of any proposal for a consent judgment under
subsection (b) of this section, each defendant shall file with the
district court a description of any and all written or oral
communications by or on behalf of such defendant, including
any and all written or oral communications on behalf of such
defendant, or other person, with any officer or employee of the
United States concerning or relevant to such proposal, except
that any such communications made by counsel of record alone
with the Attorney General or the employees of the Department
of Justice alone shall be excluded form the requirements of this
subsection. Prior to the entry of any consent judgment pursuant
to the antitrust laws, each defendant shall certify to the
district
court that the requirements of this subsection have been
complied with and that such filing is a true and complete
description of such communications known to the defendant or
which the defendant reasonably should have known.
(h)    Inadmissibility as evidence of proceedings before the
district court and the competitive impact statement
        Proceedings before the district court
under subsections (e) and (f) of this section, and the
competitive impact statement filed under subsection (b) of this
section, shall not be admissible against any defendant in any
action or proceeding brought by any other party against such
defendant under the antitrust laws or by the United States under
section 15a of this title nor constitute a basis for the
introduction of the consent judgment as prima facie evidence
against such defendant in any such action or proceeding.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE
A.    Background: The FTC Investigation
        This action arises out of an investigation
commenced by the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") in
June 1990. Initially, the FTC's investigation concerned
allegations that Microsoft and International Business Machines
Corporation ("IBM") agreed in 1989 to limit the features of
Microsoft Windows, a graphical operating system, to increase
sales of OS/2, a more complex graphical operating system
jointly developed by Microsoft and IBM. When the
investigation got underway, however, the FTC discovered that
Microsoft was busy developing improved versions of
Windows, making the allegations of collusion completely
untenable. (J.A. 202-03 & n.3)
        Four years ago, the FTC's investigation
was publicly disclosed when a Microsoft competitor told a
securities analyst that it had been interviewed by the FTC Staff.
(J.A. 203) In the week that followed, stories appeared in major
newspapers reporting a wide variety of allegations that had
been made against Microsoft, including that:
(1)    Microsoft intentionally misled competitors about its
plans for Windows so that they would develop applications for
OS/2 instead;
(2)    Microsoft gave its applications developers an unfair
advantage over competitors by providing them with advance
information about new or improved Microsoft operating
systems;
(3)    Microsoft announced a non-existent version of its MS
-DOS operating system with features that matched or beat those
of a new release of DR DOS _ a clone of MS-DOS _ in order
to dissuade OEMs from licensing DR DOS;
(4)    Microsoft obtained confidential information about a new
pen-based operating system from GO Corp. in Microsoft's
capacity as an applications developer and then provided that
information to Microsoft's operating system developers; and
(5)    Microsoft insisted that customers license its applications
in order to obtain MS-DOS and Windows.
(J.A. 203-04)
        The FTC expanded its investigation in
April 1991 and, in August 1991, began requesting documents
from Microsoft and many of its customers on a wide range of
subjects, including the allegations of Microsoft's competitors
reported in the press, as well as the allegations about
Microsoft's licensing practices that ended up in the DOJ's
Complaint. Certain of Microsoft's leading competitors engaged
counsel in Washington, D.C. to press their views on the FTC.
(J.A. 204-06)
        The FTC's investigation culminated in
February 1993 when the Commissioners voted 2-2 on a
recommendation by the Bureau of Competition to initiate an
action in federal court seeking to enjoin certain of Microsoft's
licensing practices. The motion failed for lack of a majority.
(The Bureau of Economics declined to support the Bureau of
Competition's recommendation.) The Commissioners directed
the FTC Staff, however, to pursue a further investigation of
Microsoft relating to allegations that Microsoft had altered
Windows to render the operating system incompatible with
software products produced by Microsoft's competitors. This
investigation proceeded through the spring of 1993, involving
new document subpoenas and more than a dozen additional
depositions of Microsoft officers and employees. (J.A. 207-09)
        In July 1993, the Commission met again
to vote on a recommendation by the Bureau of Competition
(once again, not supported by the Bureau of Economics) to
initiate an administrative proceeding against Microsoft. The
Commission split 2-2 a second time, with the two
Commissioners trained as lawyers again refusing to support an
enforcement action. (J.A. 210)
B.    The DOJ Investigation
        In July 1993, the DOJ, in a virtually
unprecedented step, opened its own investigation of Microsoft
to revisit issues already canvassed in the three-year FTC
investigation. The DOJ secured access to the FTC's
investigative files, including hundreds of thousands of
documents previously produced by Microsoft and third parties.
In October 1993, the DOJ issued its first civil investigative
demand ("CID") to Microsoft, which Microsoft complied with
by mid-January 1994. In February 1994, the DOJ issued a
second CID to Microsoft, covering a wide range of additional
subjects and requiring Microsoft to produce hundreds of
thousands of additional documents. Depositions of senior
Microsoft executives ensued. (J.A. 213-14)
        In June 1994, after nearly a year of
investigation, the DOJ initiated settlement discussions with
Microsoft. From the outset, the DOJ insisted that Microsoft
change its licensing practices for MS-DOS and Windows on
the theory that those practices were preventing competitors
from distributing their operating systems through original
equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"). In particular, the DOJ
insisted that Microsoft stop entering into "per processor"
licenses, under which an OEM had the right to ship MS-DOS
or Windows with _ and paid a royalty to Microsoft for _ all
computers containing particular microprocessor types
designated by the OEM (e.g., Intel 80486DX). The DOJ also
insisted that Microsoft abandon the "minimum commitment"
feature of its license agreements, a mechanism by which
Microsoft provided volume discounts to OEMs based on their
willingness to license a minimum number of copies _ selected
by the OEM _ of MS-DOS or Windows during the term of the
license agreement. In addition, the DOJ wanted Microsoft to
limit the duration of its license agreements to one year. (J.A.
219)
        Settlement discussions between
Microsoft and the DOJ continued into July 1994. At
Microsoft's insistence, the discussions were expanded to
include representatives of Directorate-General IV ("DG IV"),
the competition authority of the European Union. DG IV had
been conducting its own investigation of Microsoft's licensing
practices, an investigation initiated after a broad complaint was
filed against Microsoft by one of its competitors in June 1993.
(J.A. 211) On July 15, 1994, Microsoft entered into a
stipulation with the DOJ _ and simultaneously made an
identical undertaking to DG IV _ agreeing to abandon per
processor licenses and minimum commitments with respect to
MS-DOS, Windows and successor products. (J.A. 30-36)
Microsoft also agreed to reduce the duration of its license
agreements to one year, giving OEMs the option to renew for
one additional year. Microsoft agreed not to tie MS-DOS or
Windows to its applications software (although there was no
claim it had done so previously), and undertook not to license
those operating systems on a flat fee basis. (J.A. 32-26) The
consent decree grants the DOJ extensive monitoring rights to
insure Microsoft's compliance. (J.A. 37-39)
C.    The Tunney Act Review
        The consent decree was filed along with
the Complaint on July 15, 1994. The case was assigned to
Judge Sporkin on July 18, 1994. (J.A. 4) Thereafter, the
consent decree was published in the Federal Register, along
with the DOJ's Complaint and Competitive Impact Statement,
in accordance with the Tunney Act. See 59 Fed. Reg. 42,845
-57 (1994). During the 60-day comment period provided by the
Tunney Act, 15 U.S.C.   16(b) _ which ran from August 20,
1994 through October 18, 1994 _ the DOJ received only five
public comments, none of which came from a significant
participant in the computer software industry. (J.A. 137-54)
Those public comments, along with the DOJ's responses
thereto, were published in the Federal Register as required by
the Tunney Act. See 59 Fed. Reg. 59,426-33 (1994).
    1.    September 29, 1994 Status Conference
        The District Court held a status
conference on September 29, 1994, prior to the conclusion of
the 60-day comment period. Judge Sporkin said that during his
summer vacation he read a book written by two reporters for
the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, James Wallace and Jim Erickson.
(J.A. 85) The book, entitled HARD DRIVE: BILL GATES
AND THE MAKING OF THE MICROSOFT EMPIRE (1992),
alleges, among other things, that Microsoft (i) engages in a
practice called "vaporware" _ that is, the announcement of
nonexistent products to injure competitors _ and (ii) derives
unfair advantages because its applications developers have
access to undisclosed information about Microsoft operating
systems. The District Court emphasized that it was impressed
by the book and its allegations, and said that it wanted matters
raised in the book to be fully vetted in the Tunney Act
proceeding. (J.A. 113)
    2.    November 2, 1994 Status Conference
        At a second status conference on
November 2, 1994, the District Court again dwelled upon the
allegations in HARD DRIVE, eliminating any doubt that the
book had assumed a central role in the Tunney Act proceeding.
        THE COURT: As I said last time, I
happened to read that book. And that book does allege some
very serious practices. Indeed, they cite chapter and verse.
        MS. BINGAMAN: I read the book
myself early in our investigation, as did a lot of people.
        THE COURT: And I want to be satisfied
that _ I would like to be satisfied that, in fact, the person was
writing fiction.
(J.A. 177)
        At the conclusion of the November 2
conference, the District Court told the DOJ to inform interested
persons that they had until December 5, 1994 to seek leave to
participate in the final hearing, then scheduled for December
15, 1994. (J.A. 191) See 59 Fed. Reg. 42,426 (1994). Only one
entity, I.D.E. Corporation, which had submitted a comment
during the statutorily prescribed period, sought leave to
participate in the hearing. (J.A. 601) On December 14, 1994,
the District Court informed the parties that the final hearing
would be delayed until January 20, 1995.
    3.    January 19, 1995 Order
        The day before the final hearing, the
District Court issued an order identifying matters it wanted
counsel to address. (J.A. 1208 n.15) Those matters, including
"vaporware" and purportedly unfair access by Microsoft
applications developers to information about Microsoft
operating systems, came directly out of HARD DRIVE.
    4.    January 20, 1995 Final Hearing
        At the rescheduled final hearing, the
District Court closely questioned counsel for the DOJ and
Microsoft about charges leveled against Microsoft in HARD
DRIVE. The subject of "vaporware" consumed the major
portion of the hearing (J.A. 817-20, 825-30, 846-48, 867-68,
877-84, 893-95, 902-22. 934-35, 938, 944-49, 951-54), even
though the concept is largely unknown to the antitrust laws.
See pages 32-33, infra. The District Court candidly admitted
that it focused on "vaporware" and other issues in its January
19 Order not because they had been alluded to by the putative
amici or CCIA but because they were discussed in HARD
DRIVE.
        THE COURT: I raised these [issues]
before I ever heard from any of these other people [i.e., the
putative amici and CCIA].
        MS. BINGAMAN: Oh, I know you did.
        THE COURT: I mean, I raised these. I
read a book once that raised all these issues, and that's why I
raised them.
(J.A. 855-56)
        Judge Sporkin also made clear that he
was not content to play the traditional role of judge as passive
umpire:
    Unfortunately, I took this role very seriously, and I got
involved in this case. And that's my problem. I got too
involved in this case perhaps. But there are certain things that
are gnawing at me, and I think I gave it to you yesterday in that
Order . . . .
(J.A. 817) When cautioned by counsel for the DOJ about
assuming a prosecutorial role, the District Court complained,
"You just took away my prosecutor's stripes from me." (J.A.
831)
        Based on what he had read in HARD
DRIVE, the District Court told the DOJ that by limiting itself
to the relief provided in the consent decree it was missing an
opportunity to rectify a "mess." (J.A. 846) Operating under the
dangerous misconception that it was dealing with "white collar
crime" (J.A. 827), the District Court made clear that its
approach to rehabilitating Microsoft would be plenary and
uninhibited by legal requirements. Illustrative of its approach is
the following colloquy with counsel for the DOJ, which
followed a summary of the consent decree and the specific
practices to which it was directed.
        THE COURT: You see, what you have to
explain to me is why not if these other practices _ say while
we're cleaning up this mess, why don't we also take care of _
you must agree that vaporware is a problem. You must agree
that to give Microsoft an advantage because their applications
people have access to their operation people [sic] _
        MS. BINGAMAN: Let me go to that.
        THE COURT: In other words, it would
seem to me to say, hey, look, we don't want to come back and
sue you next week. We don't want to sue you every Monday
and Tuesday. You ought to clean up this mess. They've got 50
lawyers there. They can make sure they're doing it.
        MS. BINGAMAN: Here's the answer,
Your Honor. If I had a case that I could file today on those
practices, I would file it. I've said that repeatedly.
        THE COURT: Well, I know, but you
don't have to have a case.
        MS. BINGAMAN: Oh, I do. I am the
Justice Department. For me to stand here and agree to relief
that I didn't include in my complaint because I didn't see the
case, and I can't see it today, _
        THE COURT: Yes, but you're
negotiating with them.
        MS. BINGAMAN: Your Honor, I didn't
negotiate these points because there wasn't a case. I never even
raised these points with them.
        THE COURT: I know that. But you say,
look, you got all these other problems. Why is it _ you know,
it's just good business sense that you don't want the Justice
Department or the Federal Trade Commission to be knocking
on your door every other day. . . . [T]he point I'm saying is I
spent years negotiating consent decrees. Believe me.
        MS. BINGAMAN: About violations you
thought occurred, right?
        THE COURT: I don't know what it was,but I _ don't pin me
down . . . .
(J.A. 846-47)
        As it had at the November 2 conference,
the District Court continued to challenge the DOJ's decision
not to include the allegations from HARD DRIVE in its
Complaint. (J.A. 830). The District Court also pressed for
access to the DOJ's investigative files. (J.A. 856, 945-46)
When the DOJ declined to cede its prosecutorial discretion to
the District Court, the District Court angrily accused the DOJ
of "stonewalling." (J.A. 853-54)
        The District Court permitted the putative
amici and CCIA to participate fully in the final hearing, despite
the fact that they submitted no comments during the 60-day
comment period specified in the Tunney Act and did not take
advantage of the additional period provided by the District
Court for seeking leave to participate in the hearing. The
putative amici filed, anonymously, a lengthy memorandum and
an even lengthier appendix of exhibits _ most of which were
press clippings and none of which was in evidentiary form _
approximately ten days before the final hearing. (J.A. 269, 379)
CCIA first came to the surface when it served papers on
Microsoft and the DOJ late in the afternoon the day before the
hearing. (J.A. 794)
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
        The District Court's refusal to enter the
consent decree, a decision subject to plenary review by this
Court, was erroneous as a matter of law. First, the Tunney Act
does not authorize the District Court to review allegations
beyond the scope of the DOJ's Complaint. Second, the District
Court's expansive interpretation of its power under the Tunney
Act is not supported by the language of the statute or numerous
cases construing that language. Third, if the Tunney Act did
entitle the District Court to usurp the DOJ's prosecutorial
function, then the statute would be unconstitutional. Fourth, the
District Court's refusal to enter the consent decree will impede
the DOJ's ability to negotiate future settlements.
        The entire Tunney Act proceeding was
undermined by serious procedural errors. First, the District
Court sought out and relied on extrajudicial sources of
information. Second, the District Court allowed parties who did
not comply with procedures specified in the Tunney Act to
disrupt the proceedings. Third, the anonymous appearance of
putative amici curiae violated fundamental principles of due
process and basic rules of practice.
        The District Court's refusal to enter the
consent decree was also based on fundamental mistakes about
the requirements of the antitrust laws. So-called "vaporware" is
not a basis for imposing antitrust liability unless, at a
minimum, the challenged announcement was false or
misleading at the time it was made. This conclusion is not
altered simply because an announcement is motivated by a
desire to increase sales at the expense of competitors. The
documents relied on by the District Court as supposed proof of
Microsoft's use of "vaporware" show nothing more than
legitimate competition.
        The District Court's reliance on
extrajudicial sources of information requires reassignment of
the case on remand to another District Judge.

ARGUMENT
I.
THE DISTRICT COURT'S DECISION HINGES ON A
QUESTION OF LAW SUBJECT TO DE NOVO REVIEW.
        This Court has not previously addressed
the standard of review applicable to an appeal from the refusal
to enter a consent decree under the Tunney Act because it has
never before faced the question _ one indication of the
extraordinary nature of the District Court's decision.2 In
United States v. Western Elec. Co., 993 F.2d 1572, 1578 (D.C.
Cir.), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 487 (1993) ("Triennial Review
Remand"), the Court noted that it might be appropriate to
analogize review of a modification of an existing consent
decree to appellate review of a district court's application of
the "substantial evidence" standard. "In that context the district
court decision drops out and the appellate court reviews the
agency decision directly, its sole deference being to the
agency." Id. Here, where the District Court did not conduct an
evidentiary hearing and thus had no basis for drawing factual
inferences or making credibility determinations, this Court
need not defer to any purported "fact finding" by the District
Court. See City of Las Vegas v. Lujan, 891 F.2d 927, 931
(D.C. Cir. 1989); Costello v. Agency for Int'l Dev., 843 F.2d
540, 543 n.5 (D.C. Cir. 1988).3

        This Court can review the materials
properly before the District Court, namely, the Complaint (J.A.
10), the consent decree (J.A. 26), the DOJ's Competitive
Impact Statement (J.A. 58), the five public comments and the
DOJ's responses thereto (J.A. 119), and the affidavits and
memoranda submitted by Microsoft and the DOJ (J.A. 193,
642, 646, 670, 718, 803, 990). From that record, this Court is as
capable as the District Court of determining whether the
consent decree adequately remedies the antitrust violations
alleged in the complaint, the only proper issue in a Tunney Act
proceeding. See United States v. Western Elec. Co., 900 F.2d
283, 293-94 (D.C. Cir. 1990) ("Triennial Review Opinion").
While reviewing a consent decree under the Tunney Act is not
strictly the review of agency action, the same rationale applies
for deferring to the DOJ's (i) assessment of relevant facts
following an extensive investigation, (ii) application of
antitrust law principles to those facts in deciding what claims to
include in the Complaint, and (iii) interpretation of the Tunney
Act based on long experience in implementing the statute. See
Novicki v. Cook, 946 F.2d 938, 941 (D.C. Cir. 1991); see also
Sabine River Authority v. United States Dep't of the Interior,
951 F.2d 669, 678-79 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 75
(1992).

II.
THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN REFUSING
TO ENTER THE CONSENT DECREE.
A.    The District Court Exceeded the Proper Scope
    of Review and Applied the Wrong Standard of
    of Review under the Tunney Act.
        A court's role in reviewing a consent
decree under the Tunney Act is to "determine that the entry of
such judgment is in the public interest," 15 U.S.C.   16(e). In
doing so, the court is not to substitute its judgment for that of
the DOJ in deciding how a case should be settled. To the
contrary, the scope of review under the Tunney Act is quite
limited, and a court must defer to the DOJ's assessment that a
consent decree is adequate unless the court has "exceptional
confidence" that the DOJ is wrong. Triennial Review Remand,
993 F.2d at 1576-77. A court "is not free, in making its public
interest determination, to decide whether the settlement is the
best that could have been reached or, if not, to substitute its
own separate notions as to the proper remedy." United States v.
Waste Management, Inc., 1985-2 Trade Cas. (CCH)   66,651,
at 63,046 (D.D.C. 1985). When viewed against the backdrop of
the DOJ's Complaint, the consent decree in this case is
unquestionably "within the reaches of the public interest."
Triennial Review Opinion, 900 F.2d at 309 (emphasis in
original).4

        Following an exhaustive investigation,
the DOJ filed a Complaint that addressed three practices: (i) the
per processor licensing option for MS-DOS and Windows that
Microsoft made available to OEMs (see J.A. 116-17); (ii) the
minimum commitment feature of Microsoft's license
agreements (J.A. 117); (iii) the two- to three-year duration of
those agreements (see J.A. 118); and (iv) certain non-disclosure
agreements ("NDAs") with a handful of independent software
vendors ("ISVs") that restricted their use of proprietary
information obtained by testing pre-release versions of
Microsoft operating systems (see J.A. 119-21).
        Although Microsoft continues to believe
that none of these practices violates the antitrust laws, it
agreed
to settle with the DOJ to avoid the burden and expense of
further investigation and potential litigation. Consistent with
the consent decree, Microsoft already has (i) stopped offering
per processor licenses to OEMs, (ii) reduced the duration of its
license agreements with OEMs to one year (with the option for
the OEM to renew for one additional year), (iii) eliminated
minimum commitments, and (iv) agreed that confidentiality
restrictions in NDAs relating to specific proprietary
information about operating system software will not extend
for more than one year from receipt of such information by an
ISV or beyond commercial release of the product, whichever
comes first.
        Given the weakness of the DOJ's case
(see J.A. 215 & n.18), the fact that the consent decree abolishes
every single practice challenged in the Complaint is prima facie
evidence that the consent decree is fully sufficient to eliminate
any potential antitrust violations by Microsoft. Even if the DOJ
is correct that Microsoft's licensing practices hindered efforts
by competitors to license their operating systems to OEMs (see
J.A. 842-43) _ a proposition contradicted by the commonsense
observation that OEMs will license any operating system for
which they perceive measurable consumer demand _ then the
problem was eliminated when Microsoft abandoned those
licensing practices more than six months ago (see J.A. 925).
        The District Court rejected the consent
decree because it did not address allegations against Microsoft
that the DOJ had consciously decided not to include in the
Complaint, based on the DOJ's assessment that it had no
prospect of succeeding on those claims (J.A. 836-37). The
allegations of interest to the District Court were contained in
HARD DRIVE, a book with which the DOJ was fully familiar
(J.A. 177), and were echoed in submissions of the putative
amici, whose counsel had brought the allegations to the DOJ's
attention during its investigation (J.A. 867-68). By refusing to
accept the DOJ's considered judgment that allegations other
than those included in the Complaint lacked merit (J.A. 836
-37), the District Court clearly exceeded its power under the
Tunney Act. As the court held in United States v. Airline Tariff
Publishing Co., 836 F. Supp. 9, 12 (D.D.C. 1993) (citations
omitted), "[t]he balancing of competing social and political
interests affected by a proposed antitrust consent decree must
be left, in the first instance, to the discretion of the Attorney
General."
B.    The District Court's Expansive Reading
    of the Tunney Act Is Insupportable.
        As authority for its expansive reading of
the Tunney Act, the District Court pointed to (i) various
statements in the statute's legislative history (J.A. 1218-21),
and (ii) the phrase at the end of Section 16(e) that permits a
court to take into account "any other considerations bearing
upon the adequacy of such judgment" (J.A. 1217).
        The congressional hearings and debates
that preceded enactment of the Tunney Act contain the usual
variety of opinions as to the statute's meaning, none of which
is authoritative. See Joy v. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc., 999
F.2d 549, 566 (D.C. Cir. 1993). This is especially true of the
testimony of persons who are not members of Congress _ on
which the District Court placed great emphasis. (J.A. 1219)
Such opinions do not necessarily reflect the view of a single
representative or senator, much less the view of Congress as a
whole. Consequently, such testimony has "no conceivable
persuasive effect" because it "reflect[s] nothing more than the
speakers' incomplete understanding of the world upon which
the statute will operate." Fort Stewart Schs. v. Federal Labor
Relations Auth., 495 U.S. 641, 650 (1990).
        The phrase at the end of Section 16(e)
cannot bear the weight with which it was freighted by the
District Court. In interpreting the Tunney Act, the District
Court was not writing on a clean slate. All other courts
interpreting the statute have read it to prohibit the kind of
wholesale incursion on the DOJ's prerogatives committed by
the District Court. See, e.g., United States v. BNS Inc., 858
F.2d 456, 462-63 (9th Cir. 1988) (Tunney Act "does not
authorize a district court to base its public interest
determination on antitrust concerns in markets other than those
alleged in the government's complaint").
C.    The Disclosure Mandated by the District Court,
    If Permissible under the Tunney Act, Would
    Render the Statute Unconstitutional.
        If the Tunney Act did empower courts to
delve into all aspects of the DOJ's investigation of an antitrust
defendant, the statute would raise serious constitutional
questions, under both the separation of powers doctrine and the
due process clause. Other courts construing the Tunney Act
have avoided such problems, recognizing that "where an
otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise
serious constitutional problems, the Court [should] construe the
statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is
plainly contrary to the intent of Congress." Edward J.
DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Bldg. & Constr. Trades
Council, 485 U.S. 568, 575 (1988); accord Blitz v. Donovan,
740 F.2d 1241, 1244 (D.C. Cir. 1984). Restricting review of a
consent decree to determining whether it remedies antitrust
violations alleged by the DOJ is certainly a "permissible"
reading of the Tunney Act, see Apache Survival Coalition v.
United States, 21 F.3d 895, 904 (9th Cir. 1994), and is
obviously preferable to the one adopted by the District Court,
which gives rise to serious constitutional problems.
    1.    Separation of Powers
        The District Court demanded that the
DOJ provide full details of its investigation, including an
accounting of all charges made by third parties against
Microsoft, whether or not the DOJ concluded that such charges
had merit. (J.A. 1209) That demand is flatly inconsistent with
the separation of powers. Article II grants prosecutorial
discretion to the Executive Branch, while Article III grants
power to adjudicate actual cases and controversies to the
Judicial Branch. It is a principle almost as old as the Republic
that "[t]he province of the court is, solely, to decide on the
rights of individuals, not to inquire how the executive, or
executive officers, perform duties in which they have a
discretion." Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 170
(1803).
        In the case of the Tunney Act, such
deference is compelled by the absence of appropriate standards
for a court _ necessarily lacking any factual basis since by
definition there has been no trial _ to substitute its judgment
for
the DOJ's concerning the terms on which a case is settled. As
now Chief Justice Rehnquist warned in discussing review of
consent decrees under the Tunney Act:
    The question whether to prosecute a lawsuit is a
question of the execution of the laws, which is committed to
the executive by Art. II. There is no standard by which the
benefits to the public from a "better" settlement of a lawsuit
than the Justice Department has negotiated can be balanced
against the risk of an adverse decision, the need for a speedy
resolution of the case, the benefits obtained in the settlement,
and the availability of the Department's resources for other
cases.
Maryland v. United States, 460 U.S. 1001, 1006 (1983)
(Rehnquist, J., dissenting). In short, if the District Court does
have sweeping prosecutorial authority under the Tunney Act _
to act, in Judge Sporkin's words, as a "police officer" (J.A.
960) _ then the statute is unconstitutional.
    2.    Due Process
        The District Court's requirement that the
DOJ turn over information developed during the course of its
investigation, even if that information does not evidence an
antitrust violation, raises serious due process concerns. (See
J.A. 1222-23; see also J.A. 111, 171-72) The Constitution does
not permit Judge Sporkin to peruse the DOJ's investigative
files in his chambers while depriving Microsoft of both notice
of the content of those files and an opportunity to respond to
allegations made against it.
    Reliance upon evidence considered in camera as the
basis for decision is fundamentally inimical to due process.
Only the most exceptional circumstances can justify
determinations based upon documents which interested parties
may not examine.
Briscoe v. Kusper, 435 F.2d 1046, 1057 (7th Cir. 1970)
(citations omitted); accord Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S.
165, 180-85 (1969).
        In resisting the broad disclosures sought
by the District Court, counsel for the DOJ attempted to explain
this critical aspect of procedural due process.
    If we want to bring charges against somebody and
contend that they've violated the law, we do so on the basis of
a public record. We present evidence in Court. The defendants
have their chance to rebut that evidence and put on evidence of
their own, and they have a chance to engage in a discussion
about what the requirements of the law are. And we think that
that's a very valuable part of our system.
    If we aren't bringing charges, however, we think it's
fundamentally unfair to the other party to come into Court and
lay on the table suspicions or allegations or innuendo _
(J.A. 179-80) As the DOJ observed, the procedure contemplated
by the District Court would be fundamentally unfair to antitrust
defendants like Microsoft that agree to consent decrees with the
DOJ. (See J.A. 180)
D.    Refusal to Enter the Consent Decree Will Interfere
    with the DOJ's Ability to Negotiate Settlements.
        The District Court's refusal to enter the
consent decree even though it redresses all of the antitrust
violations alleged in the Complaint _ together with the fusillade
of unfounded criticism from the District Court to which
Microsoft has been subjected in the Tunney Act proceeding _
will make other antitrust defendants leery of entering into
consent decrees, thereby hindering the DOJ's ability to obtain
settlements that it regards as favorable. As the Ninth Circuit
cautioned in Bechtel Corp., 648 F.2d at 666, the imposition of
"elaborate requirements" under the Tunney Act "might
undermine the effectiveness of antitrust enforcement by
consent decree." Even the AT&T decision upon which the
District Court relies recognizes that "[i]f courts acting under
the
Tunney Act disapproved proposed consent decrees merely
because they did not contain the exact relief which the court
would have imposed after a finding of liability, defendants
would have no incentive to consent to judgment and this
element of compromise would be destroyed. The consent
decree would thus as a practical matter be eliminated as an
antitrust enforcement tool, despite Congress' directive that it be
preserved." United States v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 552 F.
Supp. 131, 151 (D.D.C.), aff'd sub nom. Maryland v. United
States, 460 U.S. 1001 (1982).
        These concerns apply with even greater
force to settlements that the DOJ negotiates in conjunction with
other antitrust enforcement agencies. For example, the consent
decree here is identical in all material respects to an
undertaking made simultaneously by Microsoft to DG IV. The
District Court's refusal to enter the consent decree will
undercut the ability to negotiate similar multilateral agreements
in the future because DG IV and other foreign antitrust
enforcement agencies will be wary of indeterminate outcomes
in protracted Tunney Act proceedings.

III.
    SERIOUS PROCEDURAL ERRORS INFECTED
    THE ENTIRE TUNNEY ACT PROCEEDING.
        In reviewing the consent decree under the
Tunney Act, the District Court committed a variety of
procedural errors so egregious that they undermined the
integrity of the entire proceeding, providing further reason to
reverse the District Court's erroneous conclusion that the
consent decree is not in the public interest.
A.    The District Court Improperly Sought Out and
    Considered Extrajudicial Sources of Information.
    1.    HARD DRIVE
        From the very outset, Judge Sporkin's
views about Microsoft were shaped by HARD DRIVE. Judge
Sporkin readily admitted that _ after learning that this case had
been assigned to him _ he read the book in order to learn about
Microsoft: "I was on vacation in the library and thought it
would be a good idea maybe to know as much about Microsoft
as they're going to know about me." (J.A. 92) It was bad
enough that Judge Sporkin credited allegations in a book
riddled with factual inaccuracies, which Microsoft had no real
opportunity to rebut. It was worse still to make HARD DRIVE
the centerpiece of the proceeding.
        Instead of focusing on the Complaint, the
consent decree, the DOJ's Competitive Impact Statement, the
public comments and the DOJ's responses to those comments,
the District Court focused on HARD DRIVE. The following
colloquy with counsel for the DOJ is emblematic of this
approach.
        THE COURT: Over the summer I happen
[sic] to read HARD DRIVE. I don't know. Have you read that
book?
        MR. RUSSELL: No, I haven't, Your
Honor.
    . . .
        THE COURT: [A]s I read the book, it
doesn't seem to be one that's trying to be unfair. I mean, it
seemed to be somewhat balanced. They seemed to think that
the company had done a lot of good things. But there are a
number of practices, and I gather that this _ what peaks my
interest is from my old SEC days, but things like putting out
announcements that are misleading or not true to freeze the
competition, something called vaporware. I don't know what
that is. Maybe you've heard of it.
        MR. RUSSELL: I know the term very
well, yes.
        THE COURT: And I don't know that's
true or not. But if they're doing that, I think you ought to look
into it.
(J.A. 85) The topic of "vaporware" dominated the Tunney Act
proceeding even though (i) the DOJ _ following an extensive
investigation _ decided not to include a "vaporware" allegation
in the Complaint and (ii) liability has never been imposed
under the antitrust laws based solely on the use of "vaporware."
See pages 32-33, infra.
        When the DOJ asked Judge Sporkin
whether his reading of HARD DRIVE had given rise to
"specific concerns" other than "vaporware," he responded,
"Well, you read the book. They're all there." (J.A. 91) Upon
learning that Microsoft's counsel had not read HARD DRIVE
either, Judge Sporkin suggested that "everybody [should] read
the book and maybe we'd get on the [same page]." (J.A. 97-98)
It is apparent that in Judge Sporkin's mind, a book based
largely on conversations with Microsoft's competitors and
disgruntled former employees had replaced the Complaint as
the yardstick against which the sufficiency of the consent
decree was to be measured.
        Fixated on HARD DRIVE, the District
Court repeatedly asked the DOJ and Microsoft about
allegations made in the book during the two status conferences
that preceded the final hearing. (See, e.g., J.A. 85-86, 89, 91
-93, 97-98, 107-09, 113, 177-78, 188-89) What Judge Sporkin
really wanted to know was whether the authors of HARD
DRIVE were correct in alleging that Microsoft:
    (i)     intentionally "pre-announced" software
products still under development to deter the purchase of
competitors' products (the "vaporware" allegation) (see J.A.
85-86, 97-98, 177-78);
    (ii)    misappropriated proprietary information
about new software products being developed by smaller
companies by engaging them in sham merger negotiations (see
J.A. 91-92); and
    (iii)    took unfair advantage of the fact that it
develops both operating systems and applications that run on
those operating systems (see J.A. 107-09).
The DOJ properly refused to indulge Judge Sporkin's curiosity
about these allegations, which are both unfounded and wholly
unrelated to the Complaint.
    2.    Inadmissible Evidence
        Judge Sporkin's reliance on improper
sources of information was not limited to reading HARD
DRIVE on his summer vacation. He gave credence to a 100
-page submission by the putative amici (J.A. 269), a document
replete with conclusory assertions that have no factual support
whatsoever or are allegedly supported by the uninformed
speculation of news reporters (J.A. 379). Ignoring the
admonition that one should "[n]ever believe in mirrors or
newspapers,"5 the District Court cited things written about
Microsoft in "the Press over the years" as authority for factual
assertions in its opinion. (J.A. 1235 & n.36)

        During the final hearing, Judge Sporkin
asked counsel for the putative amici to "interpret" for him two
documents they had submitted that were incomplete (and
irregular) on their face and were never admitted into evidence.
(J.A. 879-84) This was necessary because Judge Sporkin had
no idea what the documents meant. As he explained, "the only
reason I need an interpretation is because this uses a language
I'm not familiar with." (J.A. 881-82) Expressing concern about
the "schnook consumer . . . thinking of buying the
TurboCharge" (a term from the automotive industry without
meaning in the computer software industry), Judge Sporkin
seemed unaware that the documents relate to programming
languages like TurboBASIC that are used by professional
software developers to create applications software. Such
programming languages are not operating systems, the only
products at issue in the Complaint. (J.A. 915-16) Having heard
no testimony from anyone with first-hand knowledge of the
documents or the events they describe, Judge Sporkin
announced that the documents were "conspiratorial" (J.A. 917)
_ although other members of the "conspiracy" were not named
_ and proved that Microsoft uses "vaporware" as an
anticompetitive weapon (J.A. 949-50).6

    3.    Ex Parte Communications

        In response to the DOJ's request at the
end of the final hearing that the District Court entertain no
more tardy submissions from third parties, Judge Sporkin said:

    If somebody throws over the transom _ we used to have
transoms around here _ some more documents [like those] that
Reback gave me, I'm not going to just say, hey, I can't see
them and throw them away. It would be like a police officer
who gets a report of a crime and says I'm off duty. Go and see
somebody else. I can't do that.
(J.A. 960) Apart from reflecting a profound misconception
about the proper role of judges in our legal system, see Jeffrey
S. Shaman, JUDICIAL CONDUCT AND ETHICS   5.10, at
114 (1990), this statement was interpreted by Microsoft's
competitors _ not surprisingly _ as an open invitation to
communicate with the District Court on an ex parte basis.
Several such communications were readily forthcoming.
    (1)    Emboldened by Judge Sporkin's
statement, the putative amici filed a supplemental submission
on January 31, 1995 to which they attached a document that
was redacted in its entirety from the copies of the submission
served on Microsoft and the DOJ. (J.A. 1002)
    (2)    Apple Computer, Inc. ("Apple"), a
Fortune 100 company, had no
compunction about sending directly to Judge Sporkin's
chambers on February 13, 1995 a letter and five affidavits that
accused Microsoft of various anticompetitive actions unrelated
to the Complaint. Incredibly, those materials were neither
served on the parties nor filed with the Clerk of the Court.7

    (3)    Andrew Shulman, a software industry
commentator who writes for magazines willing to publish his
views, faxed a letter directly to Judge Sporkin's chambers in
which he opposed entry of the consent decree and announced
that he had instructed his publisher to send a copy of his latest
book, Unauthorized Windows 95, to Judge Sporkin. Judge
Sporkin did not disclose receipt of Mr. Shulman's letter or the
book. It was only when the putative amici attached Mr.
Shulman's letter to a supplemental submission (J.A. 1039-41)
that Microsoft even learned of its existence, prompting
Microsoft to question how much other information came to
Judge Sporkin without the knowledge of Microsoft or the DOJ.
        Such ex parte communications are not
customary in the courts of this nation _ for reasons too obvious
to merit extended discussion. As the court observed in In re
Paradyne Corp., 803 F.2d 604 (11th Cir. 1986), ex parte
communications "conflict with a fundamental precept of our
system of justice: a fair hearing requires 'a reasonable
opportunity to know the claims of the opposing party and to
meet them.'" Id. at 612 (quoting Morgan v. United States, 304
U.S. 1, 18 (1938)).8

        Mr. Shulman is not a lawyer and perhaps
does not know any better, but the secret transmission of
information to Judge Sporkin's chambers by lawyers for the
putative amici and Apple was clearly unethical. See D.C. Rules
of Professional Conduct, Rule 3.5; see also Henry S. Drinker,
LEGAL ETHICS 78 (4th ed. 1963) ("A lawyer may not
properly give a memorandum to the trial judge without a copy
to the other side, even where the court asked for it.").
B.    The District Court Allowed Improper
Parties to Disrupt the Proceedings.
        The Tunney Act expressly provides that
public comments on a consent decree are to be submitted
within 60 days following the DOJ's publication of the consent
decree in the Federal Register. See 15 U.S.C.   16(b). That
comment period is fully "adequate to permit [individuals] a full
and fair opportunity to present their views on relevant antitrust
considerations bearing upon entry of the proposed final
judgment." United States v. Stroh Brewery Co., 1982-2 Trade
Cas. (CCH)   64,782, at 71,829 (D.D.C. 1982). While the
Tunney Act contains provisions for shortening the 60-day
comment period, 15 U.S.C.   16(d), that period may not be
extended "absent a request to do so from the government."
United States v. Airline Tariff Publishing Co., 1993-1 Trade
Cas. (CCH)   70,191, at 69, 894 (D.D.C. 1993). The DOJ made
no such request here.
        The 60-day comment period reflects
Congress' view that information necessary to decide whether a
consent decree is in the public interest should be adduced
"through the least complicated and least time-consuming means
possible." H.R. Rep. No. 93-1463, 93d Cong. 2d Sess. 8
(1974), reprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6535, 6539. Failure to
adhere to the 60-day comment period would permit third
parties to "unduly delay or prejudice the original parties,"
United States v. G. Heileman Brewing Co., 563 F. Supp. 642,
649 (D. Del. 1983), precisely what the putative amici and
CCIA have done here.
        The period for public comment on the
consent decree commenced on August 20, 1994 and expired on
October 18, 1994. Nearly three months later, and only ten days
before the final hearing, the putative amici submitted a 100
-page memorandum commenting on the consent decree. Not to
be outdone, CCIA waited until the day before the final hearing
to file its motion to intervene or, in the alternative,
participate
as an amicus curiae. Even though these submissions were
clearly untimely under Section 16(b), the District Court
permitted both the putative amici and CCIA to file papers and
present arguments at the final hearing pursuant to Section
16(f)(3), which authorizes the court to allow "appearance as
amicus curiae" or "participation in any other manner and extent
which serves the public interest as the court may deem
appropriate."
        The District Court reasoned that
requiring individuals to submit comments within the 60-day
period specified in Section 16(b) would effectively read
Section 16(f)(3) out of the Tunney Act. (J.A. 1206) It is the
converse that is true, i.e., permitting individuals to submit
comments right up to the final hearing renders the 60-day
public comment period meaningless. As an elementary rule of
construction, "[a] statute should be construed so that effect is
given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative
or
superfluous, void or insignificant, and so that one section will
not destroy another unless the provision is the result of obvious
mistake or error." 2A Norman A. Singer, STATUTES AND
STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION   46.06, at 119-20 (5th ed.
1992); see Consolidated Rail Corp. v. United States, 896 F.2d
574, 579 (D.C. Cir. 1990). The only way to give effect to both
Section 16(b) and Section 16(f)(3) is to limit participation as
amicus curiae or otherwise pursuant to Section 16(f)(3) to
individuals who have submitted a timely public comment. Such
a reading also promotes the interest in open proceedings that
underlies the Tunney Act, insuring that all comments on a
consent decree and the DOJ's responses to those comments are
published in the Federal Register and thus disseminated to the
public at large.
        Even if a court could authorize
individuals who submitted nothing during the 60-day comment
period to participate pursuant to Section 16(f)(3) on proper
notice to the parties, calculated efforts by competitors of an
antitrust defendant to disrupt a settlement at the last minute
should not be condoned. The injudicious atmosphere prevailing
at the final hearing _ with center stage given to persons making
unsubstantiated accusations based on press reports _ makes a
mockery out of the Tunney Act's scheme for the orderly and
efficient review of consent decrees.
C.    The District Court Wrongly Permitted
Parties to Appear Anonymously.
        It is a fundamental precept of American
jurisprudence that parties to litigation are entitled to confront
those accusing them of misconduct. See Southern Methodist
Univ. Ass'n of Women Law Students v. Wynne & Jaffe, 599
F.2d 707, 713 (5th Cir. 1979). As a result, the general rule is
that the identity of an amicus curiae must be disclosed. See
Robert S. Stern, et al., SUPREME COURT PRACTICE   13.3,
at 563 (7th ed. 1993).
        The ability to proceed anonymously is
limited to those rare situations in which there is an unusual
concern for protecting personal privacy or a material risk that a
person will suffer physical harm. See Doe v. Frank, 951 F.2d
320, 324 (11th Cir. 1992). Potential embarrassment or
economic harm is not a sufficient justification for allowing a
litigant to proceed anonymously. See National Commodity &
Barter Ass'n v. Gibbs, 886 F.2d 1240, 1245 (10th Cir. 1989).
See generally 2A James W. Moore & Jo D. Lucas, MOORE'S
FEDERAL PRACTICE   10.02, at 10-8 to 10-10 (1994).
        The District Court credited the bald
assertion of the putative amici _ almost certainly large software
companies _ that they were appearing anonymously because
they feared retaliation from Microsoft. (J.A. 1213) There was
no evidentiary support for that assertion. Even if there were,
however, such fear is not a sufficient basis for permitting a
litigant to proceed anonymously. See Wynne & Jaffe, 599 F.2d
at 713.
        The District Court stated that "[i]t is
preferable for persons to identify themselves to permit the
Court to ascertain any bias on their part." (J.A. 1213) That is
not "preferable;" it is necessary. Aside from the obvious due
process issue of denying Microsoft a right to confront its
accusers, the District Court's acceptance of the putative amici's
cloak-and-dagger tactics flatly contradicted basic rules of
practice.
        First, Rule 109 of the Rules of the U.S.
District Court for the District of Columbia expressly requires
that counsel disclose the corporate affiliations of their clients.
That rule serves the dual purposes of (i) allowing the court and
the parties to ascertain the need for recusal based on financial
interests of the court in corporate litigants, see D.C. Cir.
I.O.P.
IX(A)(3) ("the Court will not accept an amicus brief where it
would result in the recusal of a member of the panel"); and (ii)
enabling the court to enforce ethical rules that proscribe
conflicts of interest on the part of lawyers, see D.C. Rules of
Professional Conduct, Rule 1.7. Microsoft has no way of
knowing whether Judge Sporkin owns securities issued by the
putative amici, and neither does their counsel or Judge Sporkin
himself.
        Moreover, the law firm representing the
putative amici has never explained how it can act as regular
outside counsel for Novell, Inc. (and have a partner on Novell's
board of directors) while, at the same time, directly attacking
Microsoft's planned acquisition of Intuit (J.A. 70-72) in which
Novell has a substantial interest as the purchaser of a personal
finance software product to be divested by Microsoft. That
important ethical question has simply been swept under the rug
by the District Court.
        Second, persons filing amicus briefs are
typically required to set forth the nature of their interest in
the
litigation. See, e.g., Fed. R. App. P. 29. Such a statement is
expressly required by the rules of this Court. See D.C. Cir.
I.O.P. IX(A)(3). Of course, it is impossible to assess the alleged
interest of the putative amici here because they refuse to
disclose their identities.
        Finally, and more fundamentally,
allowing the putative amici to oppose entry of the consent
decree without requiring them to disclose their role in the
computer software industry contradicts the Tunney Act's goal
of exposing the process by which consent decrees are approved
to public scrutiny. The bias and interest of parties seeking to
block approval of a consent decree are critical to evaluating the
merits of their position. That is not possible, however, unless
they disclose who they are.

IV.
THE REFUSAL TO ENTER THE CONSENT DECREE
WAS BASED ON FUNDAMENTAL MISCONCEPTIONS
ABOUT BASIC PRINCIPLES OF ANTITRUST LAW.
        The District Court readily acknowledged
that the consent decree "deals with [the] licensing and non
-disclosure practices that the Government found to be
anticompetitive," i.e., the only antitrust violations alleged in
the
Complaint. (J.A. 1227) The District Court refused to enter the
consent decree, however, because it "does not address . . . a
number of other anticompetitive practices that from time to
time Microsoft has been accused of engaging in by others in
the industry." (J.A. 1227) Of these allegations _ none of which
was proven in the Tunney Act proceeding and all of which are
beyond the scope of the Complaint _ the District Court was
"particularly concerned about the accusations of 'vaporware.'"
(J.A. 1228) That concern runs directly counter to the law
regarding so-called "product pre-announcements."
A.    Product Announcements Violate the Antitrust Laws
Only
    If They Are Knowingly False or Misleading When
Made.
        The District Court defined "vaporware"
as "the public announcement of a computer product before it is
ready for market for the sole purpose of causing consumers not
to purchase a compe
titor's product that has been developed and is either currently
available for sale or momentarily about to enter the market."
(J.A. 1228) Throughout the proceeding below, Microsoft and
the DOJ told Judge Sporkin that product announcements do not
violate the antitrust laws unless they are knowingly false or
misleading when made. (See J.A. 205 n.12, 648-49, 994-95;
see also J.A. 826, 901-02, 912) The District Court dismissed
this as a "funny little interpretation of vaporware" (J.A. 914)
and a "rather narrow view of this highly questionable practice"
(J.A. 1231). To the contrary, it is a straightforward statement of
legal principles.
        The leading case on product "pre
-announcements" is MCI Communications Corp. v. American
Tel. & Tel. Co., 708 F.2d 1081 (7th Cir. 1981), modified,
1983-2 Trade Cas. (CCH)   65,520 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 464
U.S. 891 (1983). A month after MCI announced its plan to
provide nationwide long distance service, AT&T announced a
new long distance pricing scheme, called the "Hi-Lo" tariff,
and sought permission from regulators to utilize it. Id. at 1099.
Hi-Lo did not become effective until fifteen months later,
however, because of delays in obtaining regulatory approval.
Id. MCI challenged, inter alia, AT&T's "early" announcement
of Hi-Lo, claiming that AT&T "knowingly misled the public
into believing that the new tariff would be implemented
without 'undue delay.'" Id. at 1128.
        The Seventh Circuit rejected MCI's "pre
-announcement" claim, pointing out that "[i]t is certainly not
unusual for competitors to announce a new product, service or
price before its actual introduction in the market." Id. at 1129.
The court also noted that similar "pre-announcements" had
been upheld in a variety of factual contexts. Id. The decided
cases, the court continued, "suggest that AT&T's early
announcement of Hi-Lo must be found to be knowingly false
or misleading before it can amount to an exclusionary
practice." Id. (emphasis added). The court added that a more
restrictive rule would "inhibit the flow of valuable information
to the market [and] risk infringing upon protected commercial
speech and first amendment rights." Id. at 1128. Although it
was not disputed that AT&T's goal in announcing the Hi-Lo
tariff was to dissuade customers from switching to MCI, the
court concluded that there was "insufficient evidence to support
a finding of unlawful pre-announcement" because "[n]either
AT&T's application to the FCC for permission to file the Hi
-Lo rate, nor the accompanying press release contains any false
or misleading information about Hi-Lo or its availability." Id.
at 1129 & n.69.9

        In ILC Peripherals Leasing Corp. v.
International Business Machs. Corp., 458 F. Supp. 423 (N.D.
Cal. 1978), aff'd sub nom. Memorex Corp. v. International
Business Machs. Corp., 636 F.2d 1188 (9th Cir. 1980), cert.
denied, 452 U.S. 972 (1981), the court applied an identical
standard to a "pre-announcement" claim in the computer
industry. In that case, Memorex challenged, inter alia, the
accuracy of IBM's announcement that an improved control
program for external disk drives called NCP was expected to
be made available to customers by March 1973. Id. at 441. The
court concluded that "there was nothing knowingly false about
the NCP announcement," despite the fact that "actual delivery
of NCP slipped six months to October 1973." Id. at 442.
"[D]elivery slippages," the court noted, "are not uncommon for
complex new products in the computer industry." It was
dispositive, in the court's view, that there was "no evidence to
suggest that when IBM announced NCP for delivery in March
1973, it did not honestly expect the product to be available at
that time." Id. See also 3 Philip Areeda & Donald F. Turner,
ANTITRUST LAW   738i, at 284 (1978).10

B.    An Otherwise Legitimate Product Announcement

    Is Not Rendered Illegal Merely Because It Is Motivated

    by a Desire to Capture Sales from a Competitor.

        Despite this uniform authority, the
District Court insisted that announcing a product in advance of
its commercial release _ even if not deceptive or misleading _
is somehow improper if the announcement is motivated by an
intent to divert sales from a competitor. (See J.A. 1232; see
also J.A. 912, 918-19) This cannot be the law, for it would
punish companies for pursuing a goal that, fairly speaking,
motivates the entire free market system, namely, to capture
each and every sale possible through the use of all legitimate
means available. Any other conclusion would turn the Sherman
Act into a refuge for the inefficient rather than a tool for
promoting competition. See Northeastern Tel. Co. v. American
Tel. & Tel. Co., 651 F.2d 76, 87-88 (2d Cir. 1981), cert.
denied, 455 U.S. 943 (1982).
        All product announcements are
motivated, at least in part, by a hope that once consumers know
their options, they will elect to purchase improved products
still under development. Such announcements inform
consumers' purchasing decisions; they do not, and cannot,
"freeze" sales of competing products. (See J.A. 1229) It is even
less plausible to contend that such announcements "freeze"
development of competing products. (See J.A. 1232) On the
contrary, the announcement that a product is slated for
commercial release at some future time acts as a spur to
competitors to accelerate development of their own products,
an unambiguously procompetitive outcome.
        At its most basic level, "[c]ompetition
consists of winning business from rivals." MCI
Communications, 708 F.2d at 1113. Even a monopolist _
which Microsoft is not _ is free to compete for every last
sale.11 Because the antitrust laws were intended to encourage
vigorous competition, a desire by Microsoft to persuade
consumers to purchase its products instead of its competitors'
products cannot render otherwise legitimate conduct illegal. As
the First Circuit noted in Barry Wright Corp. v. ITT Grinnell
Corp., 724 F.2d 227, 232 (1st Cir. 1983) (Breyer, J.), focusing
on an intent to increase sales at the expense of competitors does
not work "in a world where executives may think no further
than 'Let's get more business,' and long-term effects on
consumers depend in large measure on competitors'
responses."
        Consequently, the antitrust laws focus on
whether challenged conduct is anticompetitive.
    Anticompetitive conduct is conduct without legitimate
business purpose. Such conduct makes sense only because it
eliminates competition. Acts which are ordinary business
practices typical of those used in a competitive market do not
constitute anticompetitive conduct violative of Section 2.
Trace X Chem., Inc. v. Canadian Indus., Ltd., 738 F.2d 261,
266 (8th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1160 (1985). The
notion that anything intended to have "an adverse impact on a
competitor's product" (J.A. 1232) is anticompetitive is
dangerously misguided; it would proscribe broad categories of
ordinary business conduct, such as advertising, sales
promotions and new product development.
C.    The Documents Relied on by the District
    Court Do Not Support Its Conclusions.
        As support for its conclusion that
Microsoft utilizes "vaporware," the District Court pointed to
portions of two performance evaluations of a Microsoft
employee dating from 1987 (and a page of handwritten notes of
unknown origin) that were submitted by the putative amici
(J.A. 1230-31) _ documents that the District Court
characterized as "smoking gun[s]" (J.A. 826). In fact, the
documents depict nothing more than Microsoft's legitimate
efforts to accelerate development of new programming
language products in response to competitive products from
Borland.
        Borland announced that it was
developing TurboBASIC on November 20, 1986. (J.A. 910) In
response, Microsoft accelerated development of QuickBASIC
3.0, which Microsoft started shipping one week before Borland
started shipping TurboBASIC on April 1, 1987. (J.A. 910)
Whatever benefit was derived from being first to introduce a
new version of BASIC thus rightfully belonged to Microsoft,
not Borland, because QuickBASIC 3.0 won the product
development _ as opposed to the product announcement _ race.
        Borland also had a programming
language product called TurboC. In June 1987, Microsoft
announced that it was developing two competing products _
QuickC and C 5.0 _ and predicted that those products would be
available to consumers in four months. Microsoft missed that
objective by one month, shipping both products in October
1987. (J.A. 911) Microsoft's announcement, which was neither
false nor misleading when made, was motivated by a proper
business purpose, namely, to inform software developers that
Microsoft was hard at work on products with features and
functionality superior to those of the Borland product.

V.
THE DISTRICT COURT'S CONSIDERATION OF
EXTRAJUDICIAL INFORMATION REQUIRES THAT THE
CASE BE REMANDED TO ANOTHER DISTRICT JUDGE.
        Microsoft has been severely prejudiced
by the District Court's decision to gather facts outside the
record of the Tunney Act proceeding. See Price Bros. v.
Philadelphia Gear Corp., 629 F.2d 444, 446 (6th Cir. 1980).
Although it had a duty to avoid extrajudicial information that
might influence its decision, the District Court actively sought
out such information, first by reading HARD DRIVE and then
by inviting the putative amici and others to provide it with
information on an ex parte basis.12

        Furthermore, the District Court's failure
to disclose whether it had received Mr. Shulman's letter or his
book (and perhaps other ex parte communications) _ and the
absence of any statement by the District Court that it neither
read nor considered such information _ is very troubling. See
pages 25-26, supra. Canon 3A(4) of the Code of Judicial
Conduct expressly states that "[a] judge should . . . neither
initiate nor consider ex parte or other communications
concerning a pending or impending proceeding." Consideration
of such ex parte communications by a judge is a basis for
disqualification. Authority for that proposition is scant, but
only because the practice is so improper that the issue does not
often arise. See United States v. Van Griffin, 874 F.2d 634, 637
(9th Cir. 1989); McFadden v. United States, 63 F.2d 111, 112
(7th Cir. 1933); see also 13A Charles A. Wright, et al.,
FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE   3543, at 586
(1984).
        Under 28 U.S.C.   455(b)(1), a judge is
required to disqualify himself "[w]here he has a personal bias
or prejudice concerning a party, or personal knowledge
concerning disputed evidentiary facts concerning the
proceeding." In addition, a judge is required under 28 U.S.C. 
455(a) to disqualify himself when, as an objective matter, his
"impartiality might reasonably be questioned." See Liljeberg v.
Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 856-60 (1988);
In re Barry, 946 F.2d 913, 916 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (Edwards, J.,
dissenting). Under both of these provisions, it is improper for a
judge to proceed with a case if he has formed an adverse
opinion about a litigant based on information obtained from an
extrajudicial source such as HARD DRIVE. See Liteky v.
United States, 114 S. Ct. 1147, 1155-57 (1994). That, however,
is exactly what Judge Sporkin said he did.
        By engaging in its own fact gathering, the
District Court assumed the inquisitorial role of a European
investigating magistrate, a clear basis for disqualification. See
Jeffrey S. Shaman, supra,   6.07, at 159-60. Indeed, less
egregious conduct has led to the disqualification of a judge.
See, e.g., In re School Asbestos Litig., 977 F.2d 764, 784 (3d
Cir. 1992) (disqualifying judge who attended seminar at which
13 of plaintiffs' 18 expert witnesses made presentations similar
to their anticipated trial testimony).
        Whether or not this Court concludes that
the District Court's conduct requires disqualification under 28
U.S.C.   455, the case should be reassigned to another district
judge on remand to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.
See Calvaresi v. United States, 348 U.S. 961, 961 (1955). The
Court can order such reassignment under its statutory power to
"require such further proceedings to be had as may be just in
the circumstances." 28 U.S.C.   2106; see Liteky, 114 S. Ct. at
1156-57; United States v. Torkington, 874 F.2d 1441, 1447
(11th Cir. 1989). This Court has not hesitated in the past to
reassign a case to a different district judge where the district
court's opinion reflects "the personal views of the author" as
opposed to an application of judicial precedents, see Naples v.
United States, 307 F.2d 618, 629 (D.C. Cir. 1962) (en banc), or
where the district court showed such disregard for established
procedures that the fairness of the proceeding has been called
into question, see Bishop v. United States, 349 F.2d 220, 221
-22 (D.C. Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 870 (1968).
        The gratuitous and unsupported
assertions by the District Court that Microsoft (i) is represented
by internal and external counsel who are not "credible" (J.A.
929), (ii) is unlikely to comply with the consent decree (J.A.
933), (iii) is routinely counseled to violate the law (J.A. 932
-34), (iv) might destroy relevant evidence (J.A. 884), and (v)
has become "robotized" and does not "understand[ ] how it
should act with respect to the public interest and the ethics of
the market place" (J.A. 1237) would lead any reasonable
observer to conclude that _ despite having heard no testimony
and having reviewed no admissible evidence _ Judge Sporkin
predetermined the merits of this case based on "independent
research" he did outside the courthouse. In order to restore the
integrity of these proceedings, the case should be remanded to
another district judge. See Alexander v. Primerica Holdings,
Inc., 10 F.3d 155, 164-65 (3d Cir. 1993); Louis Vuitton S.A. v.
Lee, 875 F.2d 584, 590 (7th Cir. 1989).

CONCLUSION
    A.    Because this Court owes no deference to
the District Court's conclusion that the consent decree is not in
the public interest, the Order should be reversed with a
direction that the consent decree be entered forthwith in its
present form. As this Court held in Gas Appliance Mfrs. Ass'n
v. Department of Energy, 998 F.2d 1041, 1045 (D.C. Cir.
1993), there is no need to remand to a district court for
application of the proper legal standard when the appellate
court is in as good a position as the trial court to review the
administrative record directly.
    B.    Because Judge Sporkin has demonstrated
personal bias against Microsoft that he acquired by considering
information obtained outside the Tunney Act proceeding, this
Court should remand the case to a different district judge to
enter the consent decree and address any issues that may arise
in the future regarding Microsoft's compliance with the
consent decree. See Judith R. v. Hey, 405 S.E.2d 447, 452-54
(W. Va. 1990) (remanding case to different trial judge because
original trial judge formed opinions on factually disputed
issues based on information obtained outside judicial setting).
    C.    If the case is remanded on any other
basis, the Court should instruct the District Court about the
scope of review of consent decrees under the Tunney Act,
including proper procedures to be observed in light of the due
process clause, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and other
applicable rules, and the Tunney Act.
    D.    The submissions of the putative amici
and CCIA should be stricken from the record for failure to
comply with the requirements of the Tunney Act, and the
putative amici's attempt to appear anonymously in violation of
basic principles of due process and applicable
court rules should be rejected. For the same reasons, their briefs
on this appeal should be stricken, and they should not be
allowed to participate in oral argument.

    1    In a typical litigation, an order denying
an injunction adversely affects only the party that sought
injunctive relief, and therefore only that party can appeal the
order under Section 1292(a)(1). See Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v.
Wetzel, 424 U.S. 737, 744-45 (1976) (dictum). That principle
has no application here, however, because both parties to the
consent decree are equally aggrieved by the District Court's
refusal to enter it. But see EEOC v. Pan Am. World Airways,
796 F.2d 314, 316 (9th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1030
(1987).
    2    See ABA Antitrust Section,
ANTITRUST LAW DEVELOPMENTS 573 & n. 193 (3d ed.
1992) (citing only one reported decision in which a court
refused to enter a consent decree under the Tunney Act).
    3    The District Court's bald assertion that
Microsoft is illegally maintaining a "monopoly position" (J.A.
1226) is symptomatic of the errors that result when purported
"fact finding" occurs in an evidentiary vacuum. Apparently
proceeding on the mistaken idea that it was ruling on a motion
to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the District Court
assumed the truth of all of the allegations in the Complaint.
The consent decree, however, expressly provides that it does
not constitute an admission by Microsoft of anything (J.A. 26),
and Microsoft emphatically denies that it possesses monopoly
power, i.e., the power to set prices or exclude competition, in
any segment of the computer software business.
    4    Accord, e.g., United States v. Bechtel
Corp., 648 F.2d 660, 666 (9th Cir.) ("The court's role in
protecting the public interest is one of insuring that the
government has not breached its duty to the public in
consenting to the decree. The court is required to determine not
whether a particular decree is one that will best serve society,
but whether the settlement is 'within the reaches of the public
interest.'") (citations omitted), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1083
(1981); United States v. Gillette Co., 406 F. Supp. 713, 716 (D.
Mass. 1975) ("It is not the court's duty to determine whether
this is the best possible settlement that could have been
obtained if, say, the government had bargained a little harder.
The court is not settling the case. It is determining whether the
settlement achieved is within the reaches of the public
interest.").
    5    John Osborne, The Hotel in Amsterdam,
Act. I (1968).
    6    The two documents later became the
cornerstone of the District Court's conclusion that truthfully
announcing products in advance of their commercial release is
"anticompetitive" (J.A. 1232) and "deceitful on its face" (J.A.
1236), a conclusion that makes no sense and is belied by the
documents themselves. See pages 35-36, infra.

    7    Judge Sporkin said he did not consider
the attachment to the putative amici's supplemental submission
(J.A. 1210) or the Apple materials in reaching his decision
(J.A. 1210-11), but he did not say he had not read them.
    8    Accord Jeffrey S. Shaman, supra,   5.10,
at 114 ("In the American legal system, facts are to be
determined on the basis of evidence presented in court within
the adversary process so that each side can present its version
of the facts . . . . Prior personal knowledge of facts may cause a
judge to predetermine a case or to evaluate facts on a one-sided
basis.").
    9    The decision in United States v.
American Tel. & Tel. Co., 524 F. Supp. 1336 (D.D.C. 1981), is
not to the contrary. In denying AT&T's motion to dismiss, the
court simply pointed to, among other things, evidence that
AT&T had announced Digital Data Service ("DDS") _ a
service AT&T had previously considered and rejected _ a full
two years before AT&T made the service available to
customers. Id. at 1356. At the time AT&T announced DDS in
response to a competitor's announcement of a similar service,
DDS was truly a non-existent product because AT&T had not
even begun to develop it. Id. at 1365 n.118.
    10    For unilateral action like "vaporware" to
be an antitrust violation, it must constitute monopolization or
attempted monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman Act.
15 U.S.C.   2. The District Court completely ignored this legal
requirement. See Southern Pac. Communications Co. v.
American Tel. & Tel. Co., 556 F. Supp. 825, 966 n.168
(D.D.C. 1982) ("there is no evidence in the record from any
customer that the so-called 'preannouncement' of Hi/Lo caused
that customer to decline to order service from plaintiffs or to
delay ordering service from plaintiffs"), aff'd, 740 F.2d 980

Patents Corp. v. Sparklets Devices, Inc., 112 F. Supp. 676, 689
(E.D. Mo. 1953) ("There is no substantial evidence that a single
customer of [the plaintiffs'] products ever read the ad or that
[the plaintiffs] lost a single sale by it.").
    11    See Ball Memorial Hosp., Inc. v. Mutual
Hosp. Ins., Inc., 784 F.2d 1325, 1339 (7th Cir. 1986)
("Vigorous competitors intend to harm rivals, to do all the
business if they can.").
    12    See Jeffrey S. Shaman, supra,   6.01, at
149-50 ("At the very least, participation in ex parte
communications will expose the judge to one-sided
argumentation, which carries the attendant risk of an erroneous
ruling on the law or facts. At worst, ex parte communication is
an invitation to improper influence if not outright corruption.").

FILED Feb. 14 1995



CLERK, U.S. DISTRICT COURT

District of Columbia



MEMORANDUM OPINION



The issue before this Court is whether the entry of a proposed

antitrust consent decree between Microsoft Corporation and the

United States is in "the public interest. FN 2 Microsoft is the

world's largest developer of computer software. On July 15,

1994, the Government filed a complaint charging Microsoft with

violating Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. 15

U.S.C.    1-7 (1973). On the same day the parties filed a

proposed consent judgment. FN 3



I. Background



The Government filed the complaint and proposed judgment after a

four-year investigation of Microsoft. The Federal Trade

Commission ("FTC") initiated the investigation in 1990.

According to Microsoft, but not confirmed by the Government, the

FTC considered a wide range of practices including: (1) that

Microsoft gave its developers of applications software information about

its operating systems software before providing it to other

applications developers; (2) that Microsoft announced that it

was developing a non-existent version of operating software to

dissuade Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs") from leasing

a competitor's operating system; (3) that Microsoft required OEMs

 that licensed its operating system software also to license

 Microsoft applications; and (4) that Microsoft licensed its

 operating systems to OEMs on a per processor basis. FN 4

Microsoft asserts that before the FTC investigation was completed, it was

 expanded to include every aspect of Microsoft's business. FN 5



There was never a majority vote among the FTC commissioners to

file an administrative complaint against Microsoft. In late

1993, after a 2-2 deadlock by the commissioners, no

administrative action was filed, and the FTC suspended its

investigation of Microsoft.



Following the suspension of the FTC investigation, Assistant

Attorney General Bingaman, the head of the Antitrust Division of

the Department of Justice, decided to revive the investigation.

In June, 1994 Microsoft and the Department of Justice initiated

settlement negotiations. Approximately a month later the parties

came to agreement and filed a proposed judgment with the

Court. FN 6



II. The Complaint



The complaint charges that Microsoft violated Sections 1 and 2 of

the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. 15 U.S.C.    1-7. The primary

allegations in the complaint concern licensing agreements

between Microsoft and OEMs of personal computers ("PCs"). The

complaint also addresses provisions of non-disclosure agreements

("NDAs") between Microsoft and other developers of applications

software, known as independent software developers ("ISVs"). The

complaint narrowly tailors the relevant product market to the

market for certain operating systems software for x86

microprocessors. The geographic market is not limited.

In order to understand the complaint, one must understand

something about computers, microprocessors, and operations and

applications software. A microprocessor is the "brain" of the

computer. The x86 microprocessor, or chip, runs IBM and IBM-

clone PCs. These chips are primarily, but not exclusively, made by

Intel. FN 7 Operating systems software acts as the central nervous

system for a personal computer, linking up the keyboard,

monitor, disk drive and other components. Applications software

enables the PC user to perform a variety of tasks including word

processing and database management. Applications software

operates on top of the PC's operating system and must be

designed to function with that operating system. As a result,

ISVs who design applications software need information about an

operating system's codes in order to design their software.

Microsoft designs both operating systems (e.g., MS-DOS) and applications

(e.g., Microsoft Word, a word processing program).



Microsoft has a monopoly on the market for PC operating systems.

Microsoft's share of the operating systems market identified in

the complaint is consistently well above 70%. FN 8 According to

Microsoft's 1993 Annual Report, as of June 30, 1993, 120

million PCs ran on Microsoft's MS-DOS. Microsoft also developed

 and sells Windows, a sophisticated operating system that runs on

 top of MS-DOS or a similar operating system. Windows allows a PC

 user to run more than one application at a time and shift

between them. Windows is known as a "graphical user interface."

 Approximately 50 million PCs now use Windows. Microsoft

 generally does not sell its operating systems directly to

 consumers. Instead, it licenses its operating systems to OEMs

for inclusion in the PCs they make. FN 9



Microsoft, the Justice Department, and a number of competitors

who oppose the entry of the decree all agree that it is very

difficult to enter the operating systems market. There are two

main reasons for this, each of which reinforces the other.



First, consumers do not want to buy PCs with an operating system

that does not already have a large installed base because of

their concern that there will not be a wide range of

applications software available for that operating system. The

second, complementary reason why there are large barriers to

entry into the operating systems market is that ISVs do not want to spend time

and money developing applications for operating systems that do

not have a large installed base. They perceive that demand

for that software will be low. As a result, OEMs have little

incentive to license an operating system that does not have a

large installed base and include it in their PCs.

In addition to these "natural" barriers to entry, the complaint

identifies Microsoft's use of per processor licenses and long

term commitments as "exclusionary and anti-competitive contract

terms to maintain its monopoly." A per processor license means

that Microsoft licenses an operating system to an OEM which

pays a royalty to Microsoft for each PC sold regardless of

whether a Microsoft operating system is included in that PC. In

other words, under a per processor license, if an OEM sells some

PCs with a competitor's operating system installed (e.g., IBM's OS/2), and

others with MS-DOS installed, the OEM would pay Microsoft

royalties for all PCs sold. In effect, the OEM pays twice every

time it sells a PC with a non-Microsoft operating system -- once

to the company that licensed the operating system to the OEM

and once to Microsoft. The complaint charges that per processor

licenses discourage OEMs from licensing competing operating

systems and/or cause OEMs to raise the price for PCs with a

competing operating system to recoup the fee paid to Microsoft.

The complaint further alleges that Microsoft's use of longterm

licensing agreements with or without minimum commitments, and

the rolling over of unused commitments unreasonably extended

some licensing agreements with Microsoft. These practices

allegedly foreclosed OEMs from licensing operating systems from

Microsoft's competitors.



The other anticompetitive practice cited in the complaint is the

structure of Microsoft's non-disclosure agreements ("NDAs") with

ISVs during the development of its new Windows operating

system. FN10 ISVs work with Microsoft during the development and

testing of new operating systems so they can produce

applications that run with that operating system and release

them around the time the operating system is released. This

collaboration benefits Microsoft in two ways. First, Microsoft

receives input from the ISVs on how to improve the operating

system. Second, a new operating system is more attractive to consumers

if there are compatible applications programs immediately

available. In order to protect confidential information about

its new software, Microsoft requires ISVs to sign NDAs in order to

obtain product information.



The complaint alleges that the recent NDAs Microsoft has executed

with ISVs are overly restrictive and anti-competitive. The

Government alleges that the NDAs not only legitimately protect

 against the disclosure of confidential information to competing

developers of operating systems but also discourage ISVs from

 developing their own competing operating systems and/or from

 developing applications for competing operating systems.



In sum, the Government alleges that the practices outlined above

 deprive competitors of substantial opportunities to license

 their operating systems to OEMs, preventing them from developing

 a large installed base. This discourages both ISVs from

designing software for competing operating systems and consumers

 from buying PCs with these competing operating systems. These

 practices also harm consumers by limiting the variety of

 available operating systems and raising the prices for non-

Microsoft operating systems.



Based on the allegations in the complaint, the Government sought

 the following relief:



(1) That the Court adjudge and decree that Microsoft has

 monopolized the interstate trade and commerce in the market for

 PC operating systems in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman

 Act.



(2) That the Court adjudge and decree that Microsoft has entered

 into unlawful contracts and combinations which unreasonably

 restrain the trade in interstate commerce in PC operating

 systems, in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.



(3) That Microsoft and all persons, firms and corporations acting

 on its behalf and under its direction or control be permanently

 enjoined from engaging in, carrying out, renewing or attempting

 to engage, carry out or renew, any contracts, agreements,

practices, or understandings in violation of the Sherman Act.



(4) That plaintiff have such other relief that the Court may

 consider necessary or appropriate to restore competitive

 conditions in the markets affected by Microsoft's unlawful

 conduct.



III. The Proposed Decree



The proposed decree negotiated and entered into by the parties is

significantly and substantially narrower than the requests

contained in the prayer for relief in the complaint. The consent

 decree limits certain of Microsoft's contract and NDA practices.

The prohibitions concern licensing agreements and NDAs for

certain operating systems software; operating systems software

for workstations are not covered. The decree does not address

any of Microsoft's applications software.



The decree enjoins Microsoft from entering into any licensing

agreement longer than one year, though OEMs may at their

discretion include in the licensing agreement a one year option

to renew.



Microsoft can impose no penalty or charge on an OEM for its

choice not to renew the licensing agreement, nor can it require

an OEM to commit not to license a competitor's operating system.

Microsoft may only license the operating systems covered by the

 decree on a per copy basis, with one exception. FN 11 Microsoft

 cannot include minimum commitments in its covered licensing

 agreements. The agreements cannot be structured so that the OEM

 pays royalties for including MS-DOS in a fixed number of PCs,

 whether or not the OEM actually sells that number of PCs with a

Microsoft operating system included.



The decree restricts the scope of the NDAs that Microsoft may

negotiate with ISVs. Microsoft cannot enter into an NDA whose

 duration extends beyond, (i) commercial release of the operating

 system, (ii) an earlier public disclosure by Microsoft, or (iii)

one year from the date of the disclosure of information

 covered by the NDA to a person subject to the NDA, whichever

 comes first. The decree also prohibits the use of NDAs that

 would prevent persons covered by that NDA from developing

applications for competing operating systems unless the

application

entailed use of proprietary Microsoft information.



The decree explicitly states that it does not constitute "any

 evidence or admission by any party with respect to any issue of

fact or law." Indeed, Microsoft has denied in its submissions to

 the Court that any of the allegations set forth in the complaint

constitute violations of the antitrust laws. FN12



IV. Motions To Participate



Before addressing the question of whether the proposed decree is

in the public interest, the Court must decide whether to approve

three opposed motions to participate in this Tunney Act

proceeding. I.D.E. Corporation ("IDEA") has moved to intervene

under Fed. R. Civ. P. 24. Anonymous persons, represented by Gary

Reback of the law firm of Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & Rosati

("Wilson, Sonsini"), have made a motion to file an amicus curiae

memorandum in opposition to the proposed final judgment. The

Computer & Communications Industry Association ("CCIA") has

 moved to intervene, or in the alternative, moved to participate

 as amicus curiae.



IV.A. Tunney Act - Participation by Interested Persons



Section 16(f) of the Tunney Act gives the Court wide latitude to

gather relevant information to make its public interest

determination. In order to exercise properly its independent

 role as mandated by Congress, the Court must ensure that it is

adequately informed about the intricacies and complexities of the

industry affected by the consent decree. FN 13 Section 16(f)(3)

 specifically empowers the Court to gather relevant information

by means of authorizing intervention and amicus curiae

participation:



(f) In making its determination under subsection (e) of this

 section, the court may



(3) authorize full or limited participation in proceedings before

 the court by interested persons or agencies, including

 appearance amicus curiae, intervention as a party pursuant to

 the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, examination of witnesses

or

documentary materials, or participation in any other manner and

 extent which serves the public interest as the court may deem

 appropriate.

  16(f)(3).



The Act also encourages participation by interested persons by

 setting forth a procedure for written public comments on the

 proposed consent decree.   16(b). The United States is required

 to publish in the Federal Register the proposed consent decree

as well as a competitive impact statement. Id. The public has

 60 days to submit written comments relating to the consent

 decree. The United States is required to file such comments with

 the District Court and publish such comments in the Federal

Register. Id. At the expiration of the 60 day period, the United

 States must file a response with the Court and publish such

 response in the Federal Register.   16(d).



In Senate hearings before the Subcommittee on Antitrust and

 Monopoly, Judge J. Skelly Wright, U.S. Court of Appeals for the

 District of Columbia Circuit, emphasized the vital role of

 participation in the consent decree approval process by outside

persons:



The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, while no

doubt among the most competent and dedicated groups of

professionals in Government service, nevertheless is made up of

human beings and, unfortunately, human beings occasionally make

mistakes.



In approving a particular decree, the Justice Department

attorneys may overlook certain issues, ignore certain concerns,

or misunderstand certain facts. The participation of additional

interested parties in the consent decree approval process helps

to correct these oversights. Senate Hearings, at 146.



Only five public comments were received pursuant to the

procedures outlined in   16(b). FN 14 These public comments did

 not provide much enlightenment about the proposed settlement.



Since receipt of these public comments, the Court has received

 motions to intervene and appear as amici in the proceeding.



IV.B. Timeliness of Motions to Participate



Both the Justice Department and Microsoft argue that the motions

to intervene and the motion to appear as amicus curiae

(hereinafter "motions to participate") are untimely because they

were served three months after the close of the Tunney Act's 60

day public comment period pursuant to   16(b), and were served

only days before the scheduled final hearing held on January 20,

1995.



These motions to participate were brought under  16(f) which

specifically gives the court a wide variety of alternatives to

gather information necessary to its public interest

determination. Section 16(f) and   16(b), while complementing

each other

in the sense that they both help to insure that the proposed

consent decree receives a thorough public airing, are wholly

separate provisions.



The Justice Department and Microsoft suggest that granting the

"late" motions to participate would be prejudicial because it

would delay the approval process. The Court is well-aware that

Congress directed that the public interest inquiry should be

conducted in "the least complicated and least time-consuming

means possible." S. Rep. No. 296, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 6

(1973) [hereinafter "S. Rep."]; accord H.R. Rep. No. 1463, 93d

 Cong., 2d Sess. at 12 (1974) [hereinafter "H.R. Rep."] "Extended

proceedings might Behave the effect of vitiating the benefits of

 prompt and less costly settlement through the consent decree

 process." 119 Cong. Rec. 24,598 (1973) (statement of Sen.

 Tunney).



But the Court cannot sacrifice the thoroughness of its inquiry,

 and hence, the validity of its determination that the consent

 decree is in the public interest in order to increase the speed

 with which the decree is approved. Judge J. Skelly Wright

aptly recognized that in cases of national import the Tunney Act

 process would be turned on its head if the Court considered the

 speed of review to be more important than the accuracy of

 review:



[I]n many cases, I would think, and have seen, no opposition

 filed, where the case is of great national importance, then time

 should be taken -- court's time and counsels' time should be

 taken to study the decree, to get information from the public

concerning the ramification of the decree, the anticipated

 results of the decree and, in my judgment, this time is well

 spent, even though it may take day, even though it might take

 weeks; it could have a trial that would last months and months.



So, to suggest that S. 782 will not require judicial time and

 counsel time would be misleading. In important cases, S. 782

 would require judicial time, necessarily so, and I believe

 rightfully so.

Senate Hearings, at 151.



The Court is simply not willing to find that because the motions

 were made days before the scheduled final hearing on January 20,

 1995 that the motions should be denied on timeliness grounds.

 The lack of any demonstrated prejudice to the parties, along

with the need for a thorough review of the proposed decree

 are factors that weigh against denying these late filings.



Despite the complexity and the national importance of this case,

 until these new motions to participate were filed, there was a

 severe lack of information regarding the proposed consent

 decree.



Only five public comments were filed during the public comment

 period. Neither the Justice Department nor Microsoft provided

 the Court with affidavits of experts. Moreover, the Justice

 Department failed to make available to the Court and to the

public "any other materials and documents [in addition to the

 proposed consent decree] which the United States considered

 determinative in formulating" the proposed consent decree.

 16(b). At the hearings held prior to receipt of the motions to

participate, the Court expressed its concern over the lack of

meaningful information. FN 15

Microsoft's response was that it would countenance no changes in

 the proposed decree. The Government stated that while it would

 not oppose the inclusion of a monitoring provision in the

 decree, it would oppose all other changes.



The Government has declined to provide the Court any meaningful

 information concerning the substance of its investigation, i.e.,

 what it investigated and the findings it made. Microsoft has

 gone a little further than the Government and tried to allay

certain of the Court's concerns. However, based on information

 received from the law firm of Wilson, Sonsini, some of the

 assurances provided by Microsoft have proved to be unreliable

 and contrary to fact.



If a Court is asked to approve a decree without information

 regarding the effect of the decree, then the Court's role

 becomes a nullity, exactly what the Tunney Act sought to

 prevent. The Justice Department and Microsoft's attempt to

 prevent the Court from considering information provided by third

parties when

they have not been forthcoming serves to thwart the Court's

 inquiry mandated by the Tunney Act. It was not until the third

 party motions were received that the Justice Department even

filed an affidavit by an economist regarding whether the proposed

decree will restore competitive balance to the operating systems

market.



The Court will invoke the procedures found in   16(f). In such an

important and complex case, if the Court were not to invoke 

16(f) procedures for gathering relevant information, the proper

exercise of the Court's discretion could be questioned. As

Senator Tunney observed:



[A]ll of the procedural devices cont[ain]ed in this subsection

are discretionary in nature. They are tools available to the

 district court for its use, but use of a particular procedure is

not required . . . . There are some cases in which none of

these procedures may be needed. On the other hand, there have

been

and will continue to be cases where the use of many or even all

 of them may be necessary. In fact, in a very few complex cases,

 failure to use some of the procedures might give rise to

an indication that the district court had failed to exercise

its discretion properly.



119 Cong. Rec. 3453 (statement of Sen. Tunney).



All third party submissions received prior to the January 20,

 1995 hearing will be made part of the record and have been

 considered in the Court's decision. Submissions by outside

 participants after the January 20, 1995 hearings were only

 considered

 if they had already been permitted by the Court (IDEA's January

 24, 1995 and related filings) and to the extent that they

 offered legal arguments on the record already before the Court

 (Wilson, Sonsini's February 1, 1995 filing). The Court specific

ally did not consider the section of the February 1, 1995 filing

 by the law firm of Wilson, Sonsini that dealt with a certain

 redacted document. FN16 Nor did the Court consider recent

 comments

(dated February 13, 1995) submitted by Apple Computer, Inc.



While untimely filings ordinarily should not be condoned, the

 Court has allowed them in this case for two reasons. First and

 foremost, the information and arguments submitted are helpful,

 particularly the submissions received from Wilson, Sonsini.

Second, the parties have not provided the Court with adequate,

 meaningful information. The Government, time after time, has

 refused to provide the Court with information concerning the

 substance of its investigation, i.e., what it investigated and

the findings it made.



The next question presented to the Court is whether the motions

to participate as interveners and/or amici curiae should be

granted in the form requested.



IV.D. Intervention



Both IDEA and CCIA have filed motions to intervene under Rule 24

of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. FN 17 Intervention is

 not a matter of right under the Tunney Act, as IDEA concedes.

 United States v. Airline Tariff Publishing Co., 1993-1 Trade

 Cas. (CCH) sec. 70,191, at 69,894 (D.D.C. Mar. 8, 1993) ("there

is no right to intervene in a Tunney Act proceeding to determine

whether a proposed consent decree is in the public interest.").

As such, it is within the Court's discretion to grant or

withhold intervention.



The Court declines to confer party status on IDEA and CCIA, with

the concomitant right to participate fully in the proceeding,

including the right to file an appeal. Pursuant to Rule 24(b),

 "[i]n exercising its discretion the court shall consider whether

the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the

 adjudication of the rights of the original parties." The Tunney

Act allows for a variety of alternatives for the Court to

receive relevant information in making its public interest

determination. Intervention, while one method for gathering such

information, would be too cumbersome and would unduly complicate

these proceedings. Although the Court welcomes the submissions

by IDEA and CCIA and will consider them in making its public

interest determination, the Court does not find that allowing

IDEA and

CCIA to intervene would enhance the Court's inquiry. Moreover,

such intervention could serve unduly to delay the resolution of

this case. The rights of IDEA and CCIA to proceed as private

litigants remain unaffected.



The Court will deny the motions by IDEA and CCIA to intervene. In

the alternative, the Court will permit IDEA and CCIA to

participate in the proceedings under the Court's authority

pursuant to   16(f)(3) to allow "participation in any other

manner and extent which serves the public interest as the court

may deem appropriate."



IV.E. Participation as Amicus



The law firm of Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & Rosati by its

partner, Gary Reback, filed a motion to enter an appearance

amicus curiae on behalf of certain clients in the computer

industry, who wish to remain anonymous. Both the Government and

Microsoft argue that amici's request to appear anonymously is

inappropriate. Section 16(f), however, authorizes the Court to

accept submissions by "any interested persons or agencies."

Thus, the Court could accept the submission directly from the

law firm or the economists identified in the submission. FN 18



The Tunney Act confers broad powers to gather information. There

is nothing in the statute that would preclude the Court from

 receiving information from those unwilling to identify

 themselves. It is preferable for persons to identify themselves

 to permit the Court to ascertain any bias on their part.

However,

there could be instances where the fear of retaliation by an

alleged monopolist could deprive the public of relevant,

 material information. Indeed, Mr. Reback's clients have asserted

 the

fear of retaliation as their reason for requesting anonymity.

 Nothing has been presented that would put into question the

 sincerity of their position.



Microsoft argues that to allow the amici to appear anonymously

stymies the efforts of the parties and the Court to determine if

there would be grounds for the Court's recusal. The Court does

not know the identity of Mr. Reback's clients, whom Mr. Reback

has identified as competitors of Microsoft. As a member of

the Bar, it clearly would be incumbent on Mr. Reback to bring

any disqualifying information to the Court's attention.



Microsoft's next challenge is that the submission goes beyond an

analysis of the legal issues presented and seeks to introduce

factual matters into the record. Microsoft contends that it is

not the function of an amicus curiae to seek to introduce

factual matters or to present the opinions of experts.



The actual label of "amicus curiae" on the submission is not

 relevant. Section 16(f) specifically permits the Court to

 authorize Participation in any other manner and extent which

 serves the public interest as the court may deem appropriate."

 To argue that the Court should not consider the amici submission

 because it goes beyond the role of the usual amici submission

 runs counter to the plain language and purpose of the statute.

 That the law enables this Court to consider a brief such as was

 submitted by amici is without question. Accordingly, the Court

 hereby grants the motion to file the memorandum of amici curiae

 in opposition to the proposed final judgment. FN19



The Tunney Act envisions participation by interested persons in

the consent decree approval process, and such participation is

meant to ensure that the Court's public interest determination

is fully informed. The Court as well as the parties would have

preferred to receive these motions to participate at an

earlier date during these proceedings. However, the substantive

comments received from these third parties provide the process

with the information necessary to foster an appropriate public

airing of the issues. If the Court is to serve its role as an

independent check, then it is vital that the Court receive

responsible information from the public. The delay caused, which

was minimal, certainly is justified by the need to consider

the important issues presented.



V. The Public Interest Determination



V.A. Standard and Scope of Review



The Tunney Act requires that "before entering any consent

judgment proposed by the United States . . ., the court shall

determine that entry of such judgment is in the public

interest." 15 U.S.C.   16(e). Congress passed the Tunney Act so

 that the courts would play an independent role in the review

 of consent  decrees as opposed to serving as a mere rubber stamp.

See S. Rep., at 4; H.R. Rep., at 8. In determining whether to approve

or reject a consent decree, the Court must consider that "[t]he

balancing of competing social and political interests affected

by a proposed antitrust decree must be left, in the first

 instance, to the discretion of the Attorney General." United

 States v. Western Electric Co., 993 F.2d 1572, 1577 (D.C. Cir.

 1993) (quoting United States v. Bechtel Corp., 648 F.2d 660, 666

 (9th Cir. 1981)). It is not for the Court to determine whether

 the settlement is the best possible in the Court's view, but

instead, whether it is "within the reaches of the public

interest." United States v. Gillette Co., 406 F. Supp. 713, 716

(D. Mass. 1975).



In passing the Tunney Act Congress was concerned with the secrecy

 of corporations' dealings with the Government and the immense

 power that such corporations may wield. Senate Hearings, at 1

(statement of Sen. Tunney). Therefore, it would be an abdication

of the Court's responsibility, as mandated by Congress, not

to conduct a thorough review of this proposed decree. The role

of the Court is to scrutinize the exercise not only of the

Government's expertise but also of its good faith. See Gillette,

406 F. Supp. at 715. Approval should not automatically follow

 the review process no matter how incomplete or ineffective the

 Court finds the decree to be. See United States v. American Tel.

 and Tel. Co., 552 F. Supp. 131, 151 (D.D.C. 1982) aff'd

 sub nom Maryland v. United States, 460 U.S. 1001 (1983) ("It

 does not follow from these principles, however, that courts must

 unquestioningly accept a proffered decree as long as it somehow,

 and however inadequately, deals with the antitrust and other

public policy problems implicated in the lawsuit.")



The Department of Justice argues that the scope of the Court's

review is limited to both the alleged anticompetitive practices

and the relevant markets set forth in the complaint. This

position is not supported by the language of the statute, its

legislative history, precedent or common sense.



The Justice Department relies on the Act's reference to both

 "termination of the alleged violations" and the "violation set

 forth in the complaint" to support its position. 15 U.S.C. 

 16(e)(1)-(2). In citing small portions of the Act's language,

the Government fails to consider the language of the statute as a

whole:



Before entering any consent judgment proposed by the United

States under this section, the court shall determine that the

 entry of such judgment is in the public interest. For the

purpose of such determination, the court may consider-



(1) the competitive impact of such judgment, including

termination of alleged violations, provisions for enforcement

 and modification, duration or relief sought, anticipated effects

 of alternative remedies actually considered, and any other

 considerations bearing upon the adequacy of such judgment;



(2) the impact of entry of such judgment upon the public

generally and individuals alleging specific injury from the

violations set forth in the complaint including consideration of

the public benefit, if any, to be derived from a determination

of the issues at trial.



15 U.S.C.   16(e)(1-2). Fifteen U.S.C.   16(e)(1) merely informs

the Court that the "termination of alleged violations" is one

factor the Court "may consider" in making its determination.

Section 16(e)(1) also explicitly states that the Court may

consider . . . any other considerations bearing upon the adequacy

of such judgment." The broad language of this last provision

clearly shows that the court is not limited in its inquiry to

the more specific provisions set forth in the same section.



The Justice Department also narrowly focuses on the wording in

one part of Section 16(e)(2) (i.e. Violations set forth in the

complaint."). In so doing, it ignores the language of the rest

of the provision and therefore misreads its meaning. FN 20



Section 16(e)(2) states "the court may consider . . . the impact

of entry of  such judgment upon the public generally and individuals

alleging specific injury from the violation set forth in the

complaint." 15 U.S.C.   16(e)(2).FN21 This section gives

the Court the authority to consider not only the effect of the

entry of the decree on those claiming to be hurt by the

violations alleged in the complaint, but also the effect on the

public. The language of the Act does not restrict the scope of

inquiry into the effect of the decree on the public to the

specific injuries alleged in the complaint.



The legislative history supports the position that the Court may

look beyond the face of the complaint in evaluating the public

interest. FN 22 In hearings on the Tunney Act, the then Deputy

Assistant Attorney General of the Antitrust Division made clear

that the Justice Department's interpretation of the bill was

 that the Court, in certain circumstances, would look not only at

 whether the decree adequately addressed the complaint, but

also at whether the complaint itself war adequate. "[T]his

 inquiry apparently would encompass not only whether the relief

 is adequate in view of that sought in the complaint, but whether

 the Government sought appropriate relief in the complaint

itself." Consent Decree Bills: Hearings Before the Subcommittee

on Monopolies and Commercial Law of the Committee on the Judiciary

 House of Representatives, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 87 (1973)

 (statement of Hon. Bruce B. Wilson, Deputy Assistant Attorney

General, Antitrust Division, United States Department of

Justice). FN 23



In some instances, courts evaluating consent decrees under the

 provisions of the Tunney Act have considered markets and

 practices outside the scope of the complaint. For example, in

 AT&T, Judge Harold Greene conditioned the Court's approval of

 the decree, in part, on the addition of a provision that would

bar AT&T's entry into the nascent electronic publishing market.

AT&T, 552 F. Supp. at 181-83. Judge Greene did this even though

the Government had not alleged any anticompetitive practices by

AT&T in this market.

In addition, the electronic publishing market is arguably not

 part of the relevant market identified in the complaint.



Judge Greene's opinion in AT&T clearly explained why, in some

 instances, the Court cannot limit itself to the decree's effect

 on the practices alleged in the complaint. In order to determine

 whether a decree is in the public interest, the Court must

 evaluate whether it meets the test of a valid antitrust remedy,

 to "effectively pry open to competition a market that has been

 closed by defendant['s] illegal restraints." AT&T, 552 F.Supp.

 at 150 (quoting International Salt Co. v. United States,

332 U.S. 392, 401 (1947)). Simply prohibiting repetition of the

 specific conduct in the complaint may not in all cases achieve

 that goal. Therefore, the Court cannot limit the scope of its

 considerations in the way the Government has suggested.



While the Court must show some deference to the discretion of the

 Justice Department, see Western Electric, 993 F.2d at 1577, such

 deference does not preclude the Court's taking into

 consideration practices and markets that the Government has

 failed

 to address. Cf. Gillette, 406 F. Supp. at 715 ("Congress did not

 intend the court's action to be merely pro forma, or to be

 limited to what appears on the surface.").



Senator Tunney, the law's co-sponsor, recognized the possible

 adverse consequences from entry of a consent decree that fails

 to address anticompetitive practices outside the scope of the

 decree. "[A] bad or inadequate consent decree may as a practical

matter foreclose further review of a defendant's practices

 both inside and outside the scope of the decree." 119 Cong. Rec.

 3451 (statement of Sen.

served if the Court can look only at the market and practices

alleged in the complaint because of the opportunity costs of

failing to address severe anticompetitive practices that do not

appear in the complaint.



If the Court's scope of review is as narrow as the Government

claims, the Government could effectively foreclose judicial

review of the decree. For example, the Government could initiate

a massive antitrust probe and find significant violations in a

large market. Then, bowing to political or other pressures, the

Government could write a complaint that alleges only minor

 anticompetitive practices in a very small market and file it

contemporaneously with a decree that addresses those limited

violations. Under the Government's rationale, the Court could

only

consider whether the decree adequately addressed the alleged

 violations. If its scope of review were so limited, the Court

 would have to approve the decree. The Tunney Act as well as

common sense dictate that entry of such a decree would not be in

the public interest.



V.B. Public Interest Determination



The Court cannot find the proposed decree to be in the public

interest for four reasons. First, the Government has declined to

provide the Court with the information it needs to make a proper

public interest determination. Second, the scope of the decree

is too narrow. Third, the parties have been unable and

 unwilling adequately to address certain anticompetitive

 practices, which Microsoft states it will continue to employ in

 the future and with respect to which the decree is silent. Thus,

 the

 decree does not constitute an effective antitrust remedy.

 Fourth, the Court is not satisfied that the enforcement and

 compliance mechanisms in the decree are satisfactory.



V.B.1. Insufficient Information



The parties did not create the necessary record to enable the

Court to make its public interest determination. While the

scrutiny that a proposed consent decree requires is dependent

upon the particular facts of the case, at a minimum, the Court

should be apprised of the following:



(1) The broad contours of the investigation i.e., the particular

 practices and conduct of the defendant that were under

 investigation along with the nature, scope and intensity of the

 inquiry;



(2) With respect to such particular practices and conduct, what

 were the conclusions reached by the Government;



(3) In the settlement discussions between the Government and

 defendant: (a) what were the areas that were discussed, and (b)

 what, if any, areas were bargained away and the reasons for

 their non-inclusion in the decree;



(4) With respect to the areas not discussed at the bargaining

 table or not bargained away, what are the plans for the

 Government to deal with them i.e.. is the investigation to

 continue, and, if so, at what intensity, or if the investigation

 is to be closed, then the Government must explain why it is in

the public interest to do so.



Basically, other than being told the Government spent a great

deal of time on a wide ranging inquiry and that the defendant is

a tough bargainer, the Court has not been provided with the

essential information it needs to make its public interest

finding. FN 24 To make an objective determination, a court must

know

not only what is included in the decree but also what has been

negotiated out, directly as well as indirectly, i.e. what is the

 understanding of the parties as to what, if any, additional

action the Government will or will not take with respect to

 matters that were inquired into, but with respect to which the

 decree is silent.



One of the main purposes of the Tunney Act was to bring the

 consent decree process into the open. Senate Hearings, at 1

 (statement of Sen. Tunney). In this case, the Government has

 filed its complaint and decree contemporaneously so the Court

 has no

 insight into what charges the Government originally intended to

 file. The Court does not know whether the Government has

 bargained

away other pernicious practices that were deleterious to the

 public. The Government has steadfastly refused to address any

 conduct of the defendant beyond that presented in the four

 corners of the decree. The Government has taken the position

that the Tunney Act limits the Court's review to only those

matters

contained in the decree and the Court in not permitted to

explore any other areas and cannot even consider evidence

received from third parties (i.e., pursuant to their comments)

that legitimately raise questions as to whether the defendant

has been

engaged in anticompetitive practices not included in the decree.

The Tunney Act does not dictate this kind of sterile review nor

does it justify the stonewalling that has taken place in

these proceedings. There is absolutely nothing in the Tunney Act

that would circumscribe the Court's review as the Government

suggests. See Section V. A., supra. To so hold would render the

Act a nullity. "Tunney Act courts" are not mushrooms to be

placed in a dark corner and sprinkled with fertilizer.



V.B.2. Scope of the Decree



The Court finds the decree on its face to be too narrow. Its

 coverage is restricted to PCs with x86 or Intel x86 compatible

microprocessors. The decree covers only MS-DOS and Windows and

 its predecessor and successor products. Neither party has even

 addressed the Court's concern that the decree be expanded to

 cover all of Microsoft's commercially marketed operating

 systems. Given the pace of technological change, the decree must

 anticipate covering operating systems developed for new

microprocessors. FN25 In addition, taking into account

Microsoft's

penchant for narrowly defining the antitrust laws, the Court

fears there may be endless debate as to whether a new operating

system is covered by the decree. FN 26



V.B.3. Ineffective Remedy



The Court cannot find the proposed decree to be in the public

 interest because it does not find that the decree will

 "effectively pry open to competition a market that has been

 closed by defendant['s] illegal restraints." AT&T, 552 F.Supp. at

 150. During the period in which this matter was before the Court

the

Government did little to show that the decree would meet this

test beyond telling the Court that it had labored hard, that the

decree was good, and that it should be approved. At the eleventh

hour, only after the Court again requested information to

allay its concerns, did the Government finally produce an

affidavit from Nobel Laureate economist, Professor Kenneth

Arrow. FN 27



The affidavit made three main points: 1) that the market is an

 increasing returns market with large barriers to entry; 2) that

 the violations set forth in the complaint contributed in some

 part to Microsoft's monopoly position; and 3) that the decree

 will eliminate "artificial barriers that Microsoft had erected

 to prevent or slow the entry of competing suppliers of operating

 system software products."



The Court does not doubt the Government's position that the

practices alleged in the complaint are artificial barriers. FN 28

Nor does it doubt that the decree does address those practices.

But what the Government fails to show is that the proposed

decree will open the market and remedy the unfair advantage

 Microsoft gained in the market through its anticompetitive

 practices.



Professor Arrow's affidavit states that the operating systems

 market is an increasing returns market. In layman's terms that

 means that once a company has a monopoly position, it is

 extremely hard to dislodge it. Professor Arrow and the

 Government also concur that part of Microsoft's monopoly

position is

attributable to the artificial barriers it erected. Professor

Arrow only argues that the decree prospectively removes these

artificial barriers. He does not explain how the decree remedies

the

monopolist position Microsoft has achieved through alleged

illegal means in an increasing returns market. If it is

concededly difficult to open up an increasing returns market to

competition once a company has obtained a monopoly position, the

Government has not shown how

prospectively prohibiting violative conduct that contributed to

 defendant's achieving its monopoly position will serve to return

 the market to where it should have been absent its

 anticompetitive practices.FN29 Simply telling a defendant to go

 forth

 and sin no more does little or nothing to address the unfair

 advantage it has already gained. In short, given the Government's

expert's own analysis of this market, the decree is "too

 little, too late."



The proposed decree without going further, is not in the public

interest because it does not meet the test of an effective

antitrust remedy. FN 30 The decree deals with licensing and

 nondisclosure practices that the Government found to be

 anticompetitive and detrimental to a free and open market. What

the decree

does not address are a number of other anticompetitive practices

that from time to time Microsoft has been accused of engaging in

by others in the industry. Since a Court cannot shut it

s eyes to the obvious, it has asked the parties to discuss these

 widespread public allegations. The Government has refused, and

Microsoft has claimed that the accusations are false.



The accusations range from charges that Microsoft engages in the

 practice of vaporware i.e., the public announcement of a

 computer product before it is ready for market for the sole

 purpose of causing consumers not to purchase a competitor's

 product

 that has been developed and is either currently available for

 sale or momentarily about to enter the market. Other allegations

 include charges that Microsoft uses its dominant position in

 operating systems to give it an undue advantage in developing

applications software and that it manipulates its operating

 systems so competitors' applications software are inoperable or

 more difficult for the consumers to utilize effectively.



Throughout these proceedings this Court has expressed repeated

 concern about these allegations, in part, because it is

 concerned that if they are true and defendant continues to

 engage in them, it will continue to hold and possibly expand its

 monopoly position, even if it ceases the practices alleged in

the complaint.



The Court has been particularly concerned about the accusations

 of "vaporware." Microsoft has a dominant position in the

 operating systems market, from which the Government's expert

 concedes it would be very hard to dislodge it. Given this fact,

 Microsoft could unfairly hold onto this position with aggressive

 preannouncements of new products in the face of the introduction

 of possibly superior competitive products. In other words, all

 participants concede that consumers and OEMs will be reluctant

to shift to a new operating system, even a superior one,

 because it will mean not only giving up on both its old

 operating systems and applications, but also risking the

 possibility that there will not be adequate applications to run

 on the superior product. If this is true, Microsoft can hold

onto its market

 share gained allegedly illegally, even with the introduction of

 a competitor's operating system superior to its own. By telling

 the public, "we have developed a product that we are about

to introduce into the market (when such is not the case) that

 is just as good and is compatible with all your old

 applications," Microsoft can discourage consumers and OEMs from

 considering switching to the new product. It is for this reason

that courts may consider practices outside the complaint. See

AT&T,

 552 F. Supp. at 150. FN 31



With respect to the vaporware claim when this matter was raised

 at the November 2, 1994 status call, counsel for Microsoft

 stated the charge was false. The colloquy with the Court was as

 follows:



The Court: Well how do you answer those charges?



Counsel for Microsoft: Those charges we believe are entirely

 false.



The Court: In other words, the vaporware charge is false?



Counsel for Microsoft: That's correct.

Transcript of Hearing, September 29, 1994, p. 15.



When questioned about the practice, the Government refused to

disclose what it knew about the practice or what investigation

it had conducted with respect to it.



This was the state of the record until Mr. Reback submitted two

documents to the Court (Court Exhibits 1 and 2). FN 32 Both of

 these documents are internal Microsoft records. They are part of

 two Microsoft employee evaluation forms. In the first, the

 Microsoft employee writes that during the past six months he

 engaged in the following beneficial activities for Microsoft,

 "QB3 preannounce to hold off Turbo buyers." FN 33



The second document is even more specific. In a self-evaluation,

 a Microsoft employee wrote, "I developed a rollout plan for

 QuickC and CS that focused on minimizing Borland's first mover

 advantage by preannouncing with an aggressive communications

campaign." (emphasis added) These documents indicate that the

 highest officials of the company knew of the practices that were

 utilized to impact adversely on the market plans of a

 competitor. Whether the documents are actionable or not,

 certainly at a minimum they require explanation from the

parties. No

satisfactory explanation has been given.



Although Microsoft acknowledges the authenticity of the

documents, it denies they describe the practice of vaporware and

indeed, states that the practice that is described is a

perfectly legitimate competitive practice. When pressed as to

why the practices described in the documents were not vaporware,

counsel

for Microsoft stated he would limit "vaporware" to those

instances where no product at all exists at the time of the so-

called "preannouncement." According to counsel, it does not

 even matter that the date for introduction of the preannounced

 product is not met. Counsel further advised the Court that he

 would advise his client to continue to engage in the described

 practices. FN 34



At the January 20, 1995 hearing, the Government merely

acknowledged receipt of the documents. It outright refused to

 discuss them or to state what consideration it has given to

 them. It declined to state whether it had even interviewed the

 authors of the documents. In a subsequent filing, the Government

has taken

the following position: "[P]roduct preannouncements do not

violate antitrust laws unless those preannouncements are

 knowingly false and contribute to the acquisition, maintenance,

 or

exercise of market share." Of course, this is not the time or

place to debate the Government's rather narrow view of this

highly questionable practice. It is obvious that the Government

has adopted a criminal standard and may have ignored the fact

that it also has plenary civil authority to enjoin violative

practices without having to prove criminal culpability.



Regardless of how narrow the Government's view is, it is

incumbent on the Government to address whether the defendant has

 been preannouncing products and what effect, if any, such

 preannouncements have had in eliminating competition in an

increasing

 returns market where the market has clearly been tipped. Even if

 Microsoft's current practice of "preannouncing" did not meet the

 Government's definition of vaporware, shouldn't the Court be

 advised whether there is a basis for seeking to limit the

 practice in fashioning an antitrust remedy? As Judge Green held

 in the AT&T case, even practices that have not been found to be

 unlawful can be prohibited if they prevent the prying open of

 the market that has been closed through illegal restraints.

AT&T, 552 F. Supp. at 150. Even if these practices might be

 legal in another context, defendant's ability to use them to

 maintain a monopoly position that it gained in part through

 improper licensing and nondisclosure agreements certainly raises

the question whether a decree that does not address such

 anticompetitive practices, is in the public interest.



This Court cannot ignore the obvious. Here is the dominant firm

 in the software industry admitting it "preannounces" products to

 freeze the current software market and thereby defeat the

 marketing plans of competitors that have products ready for

market. Microsoft admits that the preannouncement is solely for

the purpose of having an adverse impact on a competitor's

product. Its counsel states it has advised its client that the

practice

is perfectly legal and it may continue the practice. This

 practice of an alleged monopolist would seem to contribute to

the acquisition, maintenance, or exercise of market share.



The Government has pressed for the adoption of its decree on the

 grounds that it will open up competition. Given the Government's

 desire to open up competition why does it not want to take on

 the vaporware issue?



When the Court gave Microsoft the opportunity to disavow this

 practice by an undertaking it declined to do so. What is more,

 the Government told the Court that if it conditioned its

 approval on Microsoft's undertaking no longer to engage in the

 practice, the Government would withdraw its approval of the

decree even if Microsoft agreed to the undertaking.



The Court cannot sign off on a decree knowing that the defendant

 intends to continue to engage in an anticompetitive practice

 without the Government providing a full explanation as to its

 "no action" stance. It would almost be the equivalent of a

Court accepting a probationary plea from a defendant who has told

 the Court he will go out and again engage in inappropriate

 conduct.



V.B.4. Compliance



The only change in the decree that the Government stated it would

 accept is the Court's suggestion that Microsoft establish an

 internal mechanism to monitor the decree. This too Microsoft has

 declined even to consider. Microsoft's position is that its

50 or so in-house lawyers, along with its outside retained

 counsel, are sufficient to monitor the decree. This is the same

 group that has advised its client that "product

 preannouncements" to impede competition is proper behavior.



This Court finds itself in a position similar to that of Judge

 Greene in AT&T, who refused to approve the decree without

 modification because of his concern as to its compliance and

 enforcement. FN 35 AT&T, 552 F.Supp at 214-17.



Based on Microsoft's counsel's representations to this Court, the

 Court is concerned about the question of compliance. This

 concern is heightened because even though the Company on prior

 occasions has publicly stated at does not and will not abuse

its dominant position in the operating systems market vis-a-vis

its development of application products, it has refused to give

the Court the same assurance. Without a compliance mechanism,

the Court cannot make the public interest finding. This is

particularly so because Microsoft denies that the conduct charged

in the Government's complaint to which it has consented,

violates the antitrust laws.



This is clearly the kind of case that Congress had in mind when

it passed the Tunney Act. Microsoft is a company that has a

monopolist position in a field that is central to this country's

well being, not only for the balance of this century, but

also for the 21st Century. The Court is certainly mindful of the

heroic efforts of the Antitrust Division to negotiate the

decree. There is no doubt its task was formidable. Here is a

company that is so feared by its competitors that they believe

they

will be retaliated against if they disclose their identity even

in an open proceeding before a U.S. District Court Judge.



The picture that emerges from these proceedings is that the U.S.

 Government is either incapable or unwilling to deal effectively

 with a potential threat to this nation's economic well being.

 How else can the four year deadlocked investigation conducted

by the FTC be explained. What is more, the Justice

 Department, although it labored hard in its follow up

 investigation, likewise was unable to come up with a meaningful

 result.



It is clear to this Court that if it signs the decree presented

 to it, the message will be that Microsoft is so powerful that

 neither the market nor the Government is capable of dealing with

 all of its monopolistic practices. The attitude of Microsoft

confirms these observations. While it has denied publicly that

 it engages in anticompetitive practices, it refuses to give the

 Court in any respect the same assurance. FN 36 It has refused to

 take even a small step to meet any of the reasonable concerns

that have been raised by the Court. FN 37



The Government itself is so anxious to close this deal that it

 has interpreted certain anticompetitive practices so narrowly

 that it possibly has given the green light for persons to engage

 in anticompetitive practices with impunity. To in any way

condone the practice of announcing products before they are ready

 for market to freeze a competitor's product is terribly

 bothersome to this Court. "Vaporware is a practice that is

 deceitful on its face and everybody in the business community

 known it. Why else has the business community dubbed the

practice

 "vaporware?" It is interesting that business leaders know that

 the practice is improper but the Government does not. Philip K.

 Howard's comment from his book "The Death of Common Sense" might

well be right: "Law designed to make Americans' lives safer and

 fairer has now become an enemy of the people."



The Tunney Act provides that a Court must find that a proposed

 consent decree is in the public interest before it shall enter

 an order to that effect. Because of the many concerns that the

 Court has, that finding cannot be made on the present record.



The Court fully understands the role the judiciary plays in this

 society. It has no interest in intruding on the prerogatives of

 the executive branch. The Courts only reason for being involved

 in this case is because of the dictates of the Tunney Act.

To make the public interest finding required by the Tunney

Act, the Court has to be confident of its decision. It does not

have the

confidence in the proposed antitrust decree that has been

presented to it. In part, this lack of confidence is a result of

the Government's "stonewalling" position.



Microsoft has done extremely well in its business in a relatively

 short period of time, which is a tribute both to its talented

 personnel and to this nation's great ethic that affords every

 citizen the ability to rise to the top. Microsoft, a rather

new corporation, may not have matured to the position where it

 understands how it should act with respect to the public

 interest and the ethics of the market place. In this

technological age, this nation's cutting edge companies must

 guard against

 being captured by their own technology and becoming robotized.



Some might suggest that disapproval of the proposed decree serves

 little purpose since all that the Government will be able to

 achieve if it prevails after a lengthy trial would be the relief

 set forth in the proposed consent decree.



This is not necessarily so. First after a fully successful

 litigated case and findings made, the judgment may have

 preclusive effect in other cases. Second, unlike a denial in a

consent decree, once a court issues its findings and

conclusions, a party's denial of liability has no effect unless

the party is

successful on appeal. Third, a court of equity has a wide range

 of remedies it can fashion to protect the public interest. After

 a trial in which the Government prevails, the Court is not

limited solely to the relief set forth in the Governments earlier

 proposed negotiated settlement. Certainly, all parties to a

 litigation face certain risks. While the risks are greater, so

are the rewards. FN 38 For all of the above reasons, the Court

finds that the proposed antitrust consent decree is not in the

public interest. An appropriate order accompanies this

 memorandum opinion.



DATE: February 14, 1995



Stanley Sporkin

United States District Judge





FN 1 The findings and discussion contained in this opinion are

for

the purposes of this opinion only and will have no bearing on or

play any role in any litigation that might follow this

proceeding.



FN 2 15 U.S.C.   16(e) (Supp. 1994) (Tunney Act).



FN 3 The Court has held three hearings on the proposed consent

decree -- (1) a status call on September 29, 1994; (2) a status

call on November 2, 1994; and (3) a final hearing on January 20,

1995.



FN 4 Per processor licenses, applications and operating systems

software are all defined below.



FN 5 This would include operating systems software, applications

software, and computer peripherals.



FN 6 The Justice Department cooperated with the Directorate-

General IV of the European Commission ("DG IV"), the European

Union's antitrust enforcement authority. Microsoft has consented

with the DG IV to comply with provisions virtually identical to

those in the consent decree presently before the Court.





FN 7 The 486 and Pentium chips are examples of x86

 microprocessors.



FN 8 Apple computers do not run on x86 microprocessors and utilize

Apple's own proprietary operating system.



FN 9 In the first half of 1994, 80% of Windows units sold by

Microsoft were through OEMs.



FN 10 The newest version of Windows is scheduled for release

sometime in 1995 and is code-named Chicago.



FN 11 This exception allows for certain Per System Licenses. A per

system license means a license for a particular system or model.

The decree allows OEMs to designate identical machines

containing different operating systems as distinct systems. This

is intended to prevent OEMs from paying royalties to Microsoft

for all the computers of a certain system even if some do not

include a Microsoft operating system.



FN 12 Entry of decrees containing denials by the defendant of the

allegations in the complaint are not favored in other government

agencies. See 17 C.F.R.   202.5(e) (1994) (Securities and

Exchange Commission).



FN 13 The Tunney Act envisioned that the courts were to be an

 "independent force" rather than a "rubber stamp in reviewing

 consent decrees." Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act:

 Hearings on S.782 and S.1088 Before the Subcomm. on Antitrust

and Monopoly of the Senate Comm. on the Judiciary, 93d Cong.,

1st Sess. 1 (1973) [hereinafter "Senate Hearings"] (statement of

Sen. Tunney).



FN 14 The law firm of Chan & Jodziewicz submitted a comment on

behalf of a number of small computer companies. The comment

 charged that Microsoft violated copyright laws by not allowing

purchasers of MS-DOS to resell it in any manner they choose. In

addition, the comment charged that Microsoft engaged in illegal

tying by leasing MS-DOS to OEMs and not selling it to the

public. The basis of the claim that this is illegal is that

Microsoft "ties" the purchase of MS-DOS to the purchase of a PC.



Micro Systems Option commented that Microsoft's inclusion of a

graphics feature in its operating systems would reduce demand

for Micro Systems own product, which performs similar functions.

Anthony Martin commented that Microsoft had begun to engage in

 new anticompetitive conduct, specifically pressuring software

 suppliers to switch from old versions of Windows to the next

 version to be released. Mr. Martin suggested that the Department

of Justice should reopen its investigation.



IDE Corporation, an OEM which has a licensing agreement with

 Microsoft, commented that the decree should have forced

 Microsoft to repay certain royalties received from IDE in an

 agreement of a type prospectively forbidden in the decree.



Finally, J. Adam Burden commented that the Government should have

 brought no action at all against Microsoft, whose success is

 attributable to good products.



FN 15 On January 19, 1995 the Court issued the following order in

 an attempt to supplement the record and obtain information

 necessary to make its public interest determination.







A hearing in the above captioned case has been scheduled for

January 20, 1995. At that hearing, the Court requests the

parties to respond to the following:



(1) How the proposed consent decree will restore competitive

 balance to the operating systems market?



(2) Why the proposed consent decree should not be amended to

 include:



(a) A provision that would clearly state that the consent decree

 applies to all operating systems commercially offered by

 Microsoft;



(b) A provision barring Microsoft from engaging in the practice

 of "vaporware" i.e., releasing misleading information concerning

 the status of the introduction into the marketplace of new

 software products;



(c) A provision establishing a wall between the development of

 operating systems software and the development of applications

 software at Microsoft;



(d) A provision requiring disclosure of all instruction codes

 built into operating systems software designed to give Microsoft

 an advantage over competitors in the applications software

 market;



(e) A provision establishing an appropriate compliance apparatus

 (e.g., private inspector general, business practices officer or

 compliance officer) to ensure compliance with the decree;



(g) In the event Microsoft chooses not to pay I.D.E. Corporation

 the damages that it seeks, a provision that would avoid costly

 litigation. For example, allowing this Court to refer the matter

 to a Special Master.



FN 16 In response to the allegations made in the submissions that

this Court has considered, the Government has insisted that

 Microsoft's illicit activities covered by the proposed consent

 decree be considered apart from the other matters addressed in

the submissions. The Court knows of no theory of

 compartmentalization in carrying out its responsibilities under

 the Tunney Act. Of course, related relevant conduct must be

 considered and all such conduct has been considered except for

 conduct outlined in the redacted document attached to the

supplemental

 submission filed by Gary Reback on February 1, 1995. Since that

 information has not been made available to Microsoft, it has not

 been considered by the Court. This, however, should not preclude

the Government from considering the new submission it has

 received from Mr. Reback, and if it believes such information is

 pertinent to this case, on notice to defendant, it may request

 the Court to reopen these proceedings so the information

appropriately may be considered.



FN 17 CCIA is comprised of approximately 25 member companies,

many

 of whom are manufacturers and/or providers of computer products,

 computer software and services.



FN 18 It is interesting to note that one of the public comments

 was filed by a law firm on behalf of certain unnamed clients and

 neither the Justice Department nor Microsoft objected.



FN 19 But see footnote 16, supra, with respect to certain

 materials not considered by the Court because they were not

 submitted to Microsoft.



FN 20 By focusing only on snippets of Section 16 to defend its

 position as to the narrow scope of the Tunney Act, the

 Department ignores the cardinal rule of statutory interpretation

 "that a statute is to be read as a whole." Kind v. St. Vincent's

Hospital, 112 S.Ct 570, 574 (1991); see also DAE Corporation v.

 Engeleiter, 958 F.2d 436, 439 (D.C. Cir. 1992).



FN 21 The legislative history shows that the inclusion in the

bill

 of specific factors that the Court "may consider," such as

 "termination of [the] alleged violations was not intended to

 limit the scope of the Court's inquiry. 119 Cong. Rec. 24,599

(1973) (statements of Sen. Tunney).



FN 22 The Justice Department has cited a statement from the

Senate Reports to support its position that the Court is

restricted to

considering only the allegations in the complaint in analyzing

whether the decree is in the public interest. See Department

of Justice Motion for Final Judgment at 12 (citing S. Rep.

No. 298, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. at 3 (1973)). Their motion

mischaracterizes the statement. The statement simply stands for

the proposition that the Court needs to know what other relief

the Department considered when the Court evaluates whether relief

 is appropriate with reference to the allegations in the

 complaint. The statement does not support the Government's

 assertion the Court may consider only the relationship between

 the actual allegations and the remedies in the decree. In fact,

the statute gives the Court a much broader scope of review. See

supra.



FN 23 The then Deputy Attorney General made clear that the

Justice

Department did not approve of the broad scope of the bill. His

testimony made equally clear that the bill appeared to give the

Court authority to look beyond the allegations in the

complaint. Id.



FN 24 In the hearing on January 20, 1995, the following colloquy

took place:



The Court: Well, every time I ask you I get stonewalled. Every

time -- not you -- I ask your people what is it? What are the

facts? They stone-wall me. And I don't like to be stonewalled.



Ms. Bingaman: Okay. You know why I'm stone-walling you? You bet.



Transcript of Hearing, January 20, 1995, p. 46.



FN 25 It is difficult to imagine in this dynamic area that by the

 end of the period (7 years) the decree will be in effect, there

 will not be wholesale change with respect to microprocessors and

 operating systems.



FN 26 See discussion infra, at page 46.



FN 27 When

to testify, the Government stated he was not available to

testify at the hearing.



FN 28 "The decree is to be tested on the basis of the relief

provided, on the assumption that the government would have won."

Gillette, 406 F.Supp. at 716 n.2; see also United States v.

Airline Tariff Pub. Co., 836 F. Supp. 9, 12 n.4 (D.D.C. 1993).



FN 29 The legislative history of The Tunney Act gives further

 support to the argument that the Court may find a decree is not

 in the public interest because of its failure to go beyond mere

prospective remedies. Senator Tunney cited the antitrust

decrees in the "smog case and the IT&T consent decree as examples

of

 abuses the Act was drafted to remedy. In the "smog case" Senator

 Tunney noted the failure of the decree to "require the auto

 industry to undo its past damage." Senator Tunney criticized

the failure of the IT&T decree to force IT&T to disgorge its

 profits even though IT&T prospectively had to divest itself of

 certain companies. 119 Cong. Rec. 24,598 (1973). See also

 testimony of Judge J. Skelly Wright, Senate Hearings, at 147.



FN 30 The goal of the remedy is not only to prevent future

occurrences of illegal conduct, but also to cure the ill effects

of such conduct and to deny the violator future benefits of that

conduct. See United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 340

U.S. 76, 88-89 (1950); Wilk v. American Medical Association, 671

F.Supp. 1465, 1484-85 (N.D.Ill. 1987), aff'd 895 F.2d 352 (7th

Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 927 (199O).



FN 31 The Court may not only consider practices outside the

complaint, it may also prohibit such practices even if they have

not been found to be unlawful if that is necessary to formulate

an effective decree to prevent the recurrence of monopolization.

See AT&T, 552 F.Supp. at 150 n.80 (citing with approval

United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 110 F.Supp 295,

346-47, aff'd, 347 U.S. 521 (1954) and Hartford-Empire Co. v.

United States, 323 U.S. 386, 409 (1945)); see also United States

Gypsum Co., 340 U.S. at 89.



FN 32 According to Mr. Reback, these documents come from public

sources.



FN 33 QB3 is Microsoft software; Turbo is software developed by

Borland, one of Microsoft's competitors.



FN 34 Transcript of Hearing, January 20, 1995, p. 110-11.



FN 35 The proposed AT&T decree and the decree before this Court

contain almost identical provisions regarding the Court's role in

enforcement and continuing jurisdiction.



FN 36 Microsoft has stated to the press over the years that there

 is a "Chinese Wall" between its operating systems and

 applications divisions. See Memorandum of Amici Curiae in

 Opposition to Proposed Final Judgment, p. 19. In Microsoft's

 submission

to the Court, it maintains that there is no such separation and

 that one is not necessary. See Memorandum of Microsoft

 Corporation in Support of Proposed Final Judgment, p. 7 n.12.



FN 37 See footnote 15, supra.



FN 38 The Government has expressed concern that if the Court

rejects the consent decree, Microsoft would be able to

reinstitute the prohibited practices that have been banned by

the consent decree with which Microsoft has voluntarily agreed

to comply

pending this Court's determination. The Government's fears are

misplaced. The Government is reminded that it has filed with the

Court a complaint in which it has prayed for an injunction

against Microsoft enjoining it "from engaging or carrying out,

renewing or attempting to engage, carry out or renew any

contracts, agreements, practices or understandings in violation

of the Sherman Act [and] (4) that plaintiffs have such other

relief that the court may consider necessary or appropriate to

restore competitive conditions in the markets affected by

Microsoft's unlawful conduct."



If Microsoft wants to dissolve its "standstill" agreement with

the Government pending the completion of these proceedings, the

Government certainly can move for a preliminary injunction

pending conclusion of the litigation. If it can prove to the

Court the merits of its position, it will be entitled to

appropriate relief.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA


UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Plaintiff,

vs.

MICROSOFT CORPORATION and
INTUIT INCORPORATED,
Defendants.

No. C-95-1393 WHO

PRETRIAL ORDER
NUMBER 1



After plaintiff, United States of America, filed its complaint on
April 27, 1995, alleging that the proposed acquisition of
defendant Intuit Incorporated by defendant Microsoft Corporation
would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. section 15,
the parties appropriately agreed that the public interest demands
a speedy resolution of the important legal and factual questions
raised inherent in the dispute. To accomplish this purpose, the
parties entered into a stipulation, annexed hereto as Exhibit A,
providing procedures designed to expedite trial preparation and
shorten the length of trial and expedite the appellate process,
The parties left it to the Court to determine whether the pretrial
preparation should take six or eight weeks from the date of filing
the complaint and whether at trial each party would take one week
or two weeks to present its case. Accordingly,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:

1. The hearing on plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction,
pursuant to Rule 65(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
is consolidated with a trial on the merits that will commence on
Monday, June 26, 1995, at 8:30 a.m.

2. Plaintiff and defendants jointly will each have no more than
forty-five (45) trial hours to present their case, including both
direct and cross-examination of witnesses and presentation of
legal arguments to the Court. Cross-examination time will run
against the party or parties cross-examining the witness rather
than against the time of the party who called the witness.

3. The Court will be in session from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Monday
through Thursday, including two fifteen (15) minute breaks.

4. A pretrial conference will be held on Thursday, June 22, 1995,
at 10:00 a.m.

5. In accordance with the Stipulation,

a. The parties will submit an agreed confidentiality stipulation
and protective order to the Court for its approval by May 3, 1995.


b. Defendants will answer the complaint by May 12, 1995.

c. All discovery will be completed by no later than June 16, 1995,
with the exception of discovery directed to plaintiff's rebuttal
expert witnesses, if any.

d. Plaintiff has no present intention of serving requests for the
production of documents on defendants, but reserves the right to
do so on a limited basis if (a) defendants put in issue matters
not covered by plaintiff's previous discovery demands, or (b) such
requests are directed to matters or events occurring since
defendants' previous document productions. Plaintiff may serve a
maximum of twenty (20) contention interrogatories if they are not
duplicative of interrogatories contained in plaintiff's previous
Civil Investigative Demands and Requests for Additional
Information and Documents under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976.

e. Defendants jointly will propound a maximum of twenty-five (25)
written interrogatories and twenty-five (25) requests for
production of documents to plaintiff.

f. The parties will respond to all written interrogatories and
will produce documents responsive to all document production
requests within seven (7) days of receipt, and will inform the
opposing party or parties promptly of any objections to such
discovery demands.

g. Plaintiff will have the right to depose any person on
defendants' list of trial witnesses. In addition, plaintiff can
take a maximum of four (4) additional full-day depositions of
current employees of either of the defendants.

h. All depositions will be limited to a single day and, unless
otherwise agreed between the parties, will commence at 9:00 a.m.
and will conclude no later than 5:00 p.m. Depositions of current
employees on defendants' list of trial witnesses who have been
deposed previously will be limited to five (5) hours of testimony.


i. By May 3, 1995, the parties will exchange lists for trial,
including both live and deposition witnesses. The witness lists
will include a statement of topics to be addressed in the
testimony of each witness. The witness lists for plaintiff and for
defendants jointly will each include no more than twenty (20) live
witnesses, including any subsequent supplementation. The witness
lists may be supplemented by adding the name of any person who is
thereafter deposed no later than forty-eight (48) hours after the
close of his or her deposition. The witness lists may also be
supplemented on a limited basis in good faith until June 14, 1995.
Thereafter, no supplementation of witness lists will be permitted
except by leave of the Court for compelling cause shown.

j. The parties will exchange proposed stipulations of
uncontroverted facts by May 5, 1995, and will negotiate in good
faith to finalize those stipulations as soon as practicable.

k. The parties will exchange designations of portions of
transcripts or videotapes of depositions to be used at trial no
later than June 14, 1995. Such designations by plaintiff and by
defendants jointly will not exceed five hundred (500) transcripts
pages (or the equivalent in videotape excerpts). The parties will
exchange counter-designations relevant to the portions of the
transcript designated by the opposing party or parties and will
interpose objections to those designations no later than June 17,
1995. The parties will interpose objections to such
counter-designations no later than June 20, 1995.

l. The parties shall endeavor to make their trial witnesses or
other persons under their control available for deposition within
seventy-two (72) hours of the date on which the deposition is
originally noticed. Any person not ultimately available for
deposition by subpoena or otherwise who was not previously deposed
in circumstances where counsel for one of the defendants was
permitted to attend and cross-examine may not be called as a
witness at trial.

m. No later than June 12, 1995, the parties will exchange lists of
exhibits to be used at trial. The parties will stipulate as to the
admissibility of all such exhibits except as to relevance,
materiality and cumulativeness, unless a good-faith objection is
raised concerning authenticity or hearsay within five (5) days
following receipt of the list. The exhibit lists may be
supplemented on a limited basis in good faith until June 19, 1995,
and any good-faith objections to such supplementation must be
raised by no later than June 23, 1995.

n. All charts, diagrams or other graphic evidence will be included
in the Exhibit list. Any such graphic evidence created thereafter
shall be furnished to the opposing party or parties within
forty-eight (48) hours after its preparation and in no event less
than twenty-four (24) hours before it is offered in evidence.

o. Plaintiff will designate all expert witnesses and provide
defendants with all reports prepared by those witnesses no later
than June 5, 1995. Defendants will designate all expert witnesses
and provide plaintiff with all reports prepared by those witnesses
no later than June 9, 1995. Plaintiff will designate any rebuttal
expert witnesses and provide defendants with all reports prepared
by those witnesses no later than June 13, 1995. The parties may
depose expert witnesses designated by the opposing party or
parties, subject to the one-day limitation noted previously.

p. Plaintiff will serve and file a pretrial memorandum no later
than June 14, 1995. Defendants will serve and file a pretrial
memorandum no later than June 21, 1995.

q. No later than June 16, 1995, the parties will submit the
pretrial statements required by Local Rule 235.7, including the
previously agreed stipulation of uncontroverted facts.

r. All motions in limine will be filed no later than June 16,
1995, and all responses to such motions will be filed no later
than June 21, 1995. If the Court finds that five (5) days is
inadequate time to address all motions in limine, the trial date
will be postponed to accommodate the Court's schedule.

s. All correspondence, court papers (excluding voluminous
attachments) and discovery requests will be served by facsimile as
well as by overnight courier. Documents received after 4:00 p.m.
Pacific Daylight Time shall be deemed to have been received the
following day.

6. A list of exhibits, with a brief statement following each
exhibit that describes its substance or purpose and the identity
of the sponsoring witness shall be prepared in accordance with
Local Rule 235-7(j), and shall be prepared on a form substantially
similar to the form annexed hereto as Exhibit B. The exhibits
shall be numbered consecutively. Plaintiff's exhibits shall
commence with "Exhibit No. 1" and defendants' exhibits shall
commence with "Exhibit No. "1000." Each party's exhibits shall be
marked with the exhibit tags annexed hereto as Exhibit C.

7. The originals and two copies of the exhibits (in loose-leaf
binders with tabs) shall be lodged with the Clerk's Office. In
addition, at trial counsel shall have one set of exhibits for
their own use and one set for the witnesses.

Any document lodged with the Clerk's Office shall be delivered to
the Clerk's Office in boxes or binders clearly marked with the
caption and number of the case, the name(s) of the party(ies)
lodging the document(s) and the contents of the box(es) and/or
binder(s). A notice of lodging shall be filed with the Court.

If there is any difficulty with the Clerk's Office in the lodging
of documents required by this Order, please ask the filing clerk
in the Clerk's Office to contact the Judge's Court Clerk or to
call his chambers for clarifications.

8. Plaintiff shall serve and file with the Court proposed findings
of fact and conclusions of law no later than June 21, 1995. The
findings of fact shall set forth in simple declarative sentences,
separately numbered, all factual contentions relied upon by the
party in support of its claim for relief. Such findings of fact
shall, so far as possible, contain no color words, labels, or
legal conclusions, and shall be set forth so as to enable the
opposing party to set forth the counterfindings required.

9. Defendants shall file counterfindings of fact and conclusions
of law numbered to correspond with the opposing party's findings
of fact and conclusions of law. The counterfindings of fact shall
set forth in simple, declarative sentences, separately numbered,
all factual contentions relied upon by the party. Such
counterfindings shall, so far as possible, contain no color words,
labels, or legal conclusions, and shall set forth only the party's
contentions as to the same factual matters set forth in the
opposing party's corresponding findings of fact of the same
number. Additional findings of fact and conclusions of law, upon
which the party relies and as to which the plaintiff has not set
forth a contention, shall also be set forth. Such additional
findings and conclusions shall follow and be numbered
consecutively with the party's counterfindings and conclusions
that correspond to the opposing party's findings and conclusions.
Defendants' counterfindings shall be filed no later than June 26,
1995.

10. The Court clarifies its suggestion to counsel with respect to
communications with the media and suggests that as officers of the
Court they exercise sound discretion in responding to any media
questions.

COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AGAINST COMBINATION IN VIOLATION
OF SECTION 7 OF THE CLAYTON ACT


The United States of America, acting under the direction of the
Attorney General, brings this civil action pursuant to Section
15 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C.  25, to obtain
equitable and other relief to prevent a violation of Section 7
of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C.  18, and alleges:

Nature of the Action

1. The United States brings this antitrust action to prevent the
proposed acquisition by Microsoft Corporation, the world's
largest and most powerful personal computer software company, of
Intuit, Inc., the dominant producer of Personal
Finance/Checkbook ("PF/Checkbook") software. Microsoft is
Intuit's most significant competitor. The proposed acquisition
would eliminate competition between Microsoft and Intuit, which
has benefitted consumers by leading to high quality, innovative
products at low prices.

2. The PF/Checkbook Software Market is highly concentrated, with
Intuit's
"Quicken" product commanding a 1994 unit sales share of 69% and a
total installed base of more than seven million customers.
Microsoft's PF/Checkbook product, "Microsoft Money," was
introduced in 1991, and the resulting competition led to lower
prices and increased innovation. Microsoft is now the number two
competitor in the PF/Checkbook Software Market, with a 1994 unit
sales market share of about 22%, and an installed user base of
about one million customers. Absent the acquisition, Microsoft
Money would likely continue to compete successfully because (a)
Microsoft already has devoted substantial resources to the Money
products which it would increase even more substantially in the
future, and (b) the PF/Checkbook Software Market, for the
reasons explained below, is strategically important to
Microsoft.

3. The effects of this proposed acquisition could reach well
beyond today's PF/Checkbook Software Market. The acquisition
threatens harm to consumers in other important areas of
commerce, especially the area of personal computer based ("PC-
based") home banking, which is a relatively tiny part of the
PF/Checkbook Software Market today. Before the acquisition,
Microsoft and Intuit had independent plans to compete in the
field of electronic
commerce, starting with enhancement of their PF/Checkbook
software products to enter the emerging home banking
marketplace. Established PF/Checkbook software products provide
an important asset to develop home banking, in part because
existing customers are likely candidates for PC-based home
banking. The special competitive significance to Microsoft and
Intuit of dominating the present PF/Checkbook Software Market as
a strategic "cornerstone" asset in that emerging business (and
the likely effect of the proposed acquisition) were recognized
by Intuit's Chairman, who wrote in a September 1994 memorandum
to his board about the proposed acquisition of Intuit by
"Godzilla" (Intuit's code name for Microsoft):

Our future vision is both vulnerable to and would benefit from
Godzilla's strengths.... Our combination gives FIs [Financial
Institutions] one clear option, eliminating a bloody share war
and speeding adoption. --That, in turn enriches the terms of
trade we can negotiate with FIs.

Vulnerability [of Intuit to Microsoft] is a key question.

If we believe we are not overly vulnerable, then we believe we
can succeed. Elimination of competition will enhance that
success, perhaps greatly. (Emphasis supplied).

4. Microsoft's Manager, Business Development and Investments,
reached a similar conclusion in an August 1994 analysis of the
proposed acquisition.

* Slade [a Microsoft code name for Intuit] is the clear and
dominant leader in PF software and the current installed base of
users would likely prefer to stay with Quicken when they do
electronic transactions. MS owns Windows and Marvel [a new
Microsoft on-line network] and therefore is in a much better
position to access many millions of users in the future with PF
service options. Since neither company has both of these
strengths, the banks, credit card associations and others
are in a stronger position to play us off against each other.
As a combination, we would be dominant.

(Emphasis supplied).

5. Microsoft has agreed to acquire Intuit for what, as of Monday,
April 24, 1995 would exceed $2 billion in Microsoft stock, more
than twice Intuit's preannouncement market capitalization of
$813 million. In an attempt to avoid an obvious antitrust
challenge, Microsoft
devised a planned "fix," whereby it has agreed simultaneously to
transfer part (but not all) of Microsoft's Money business unit
to a third party, Novell, Inc. The purported fix would fail to
remedy the anticompetitive effects of the proposed Intuit
transaction. Novell, with the assets it
is supposed to receive from Microsoft, cannot be nearly as
effective a competitor with Money as Microsoft is and would be
absent the transaction.

6. If consummated, the proposed transaction, even accounting for
the asset sale to Novell, likely would add to the dominance of
the number one product (Quicken), would weaken greatly the
number two product (Money), and would substantially increase
concentration and substantially reduce competition in the
PF/Checkbook Software Market. Because these products are a
crucial springboard into other important, but emerging, areas of
commerce, the effect on consumers would likely be higher prices
and lessened innovation not only in PF/Checkbook software
products but in other related products and services, such as PC-
based home banking.

7. Accordingly, the proposed acquisition violates Section 7 of
the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C.  18.

Jurisdiction

8. Microsoft sells Microsoft Money and Intuit sells Quicken in
interstate commerce. Defendants' activities in developing,
producing and selling Money and Quicken also substantially
affect interstate commerce in other respects. The Court has
jurisdiction of this action and jurisdiction over the parties
pursuant to 15 U.S.C.  22 and 28 U.S.C.  1331 and 1337.

Venue

9. Both Microsoft and Intuit transact business in this District.
Venue is proper in this District under 15 U.S.C.  22 and 28
U.S.C.  1391(c).

The Defendants

10. Microsoft is a Washington corporation with its headquarters
in Redmond, Washington. Microsoft's operating system software,
particularly its Disk Operating System ("DOS") and its
associated Windows product, are by far the dominant operating
systems for Intel
x86 architecture personal computers (sometimes also called IBM-
compatible" personal
computers), which in turn is the dominant platform for personal
computing. Microsoft also develops, markets and sells
applications software, including applications software for use
with DOS and Windows on IBM-compatible personal computers.
Microsoft has announced that it will introduce "Windows 95" in
August of this year. Windows 95 will be the next upgraded
release of Microsoft's Windows operating system.

11. Microsoft has a dominant position in operating systems for
IBM-compatible personal computers. It also is the most powerful
competitor in the world for many categories of applications
software. Using its resources and operating system position,
Microsoft has introduced new products to compete directly
against, and has secured the leading position over,
the previous leaders in the most significant business
applications software categories for IBM-compatible personal
computers, including spreadsheet software (Microsoft's Excel has
overtaken
Lotus 1-2-3), word processing software (Microsoft's Word has
overtaken WordPerfect), and others. Intense competition against
category leaders by the most powerful competitor in the industry
has benefitted consumers by increasing the pace of innovation
and accelerating the price decline of products in those
categories.*

12. In the field of consumer software for IBM-compatible personal
computers, Microsoft also has competed vigorously and
successfully. It has the leading applications in several
categories, including a combined word
processing/spreadsheet/database product (Microsoft Works), a
low-end desktop publishing product (Microsoft Publisher), a CD-
ROM encyclopedia (Microsoft Encarta) and others. As with
business applications, Microsoft has directly challenged the
leader in some categories (such as desktop publishing and CD-ROM
encyclopedias), and has competed successfully to a leading
position. Such competition has benefitted consumers through
greater innovation and lower prices.

13. Intuit is a Delaware corporation with its headquarters in
Menlo Park, California. Intuit has concentrated its efforts on
the development and sale of financial applications software.
Intuit's Quicken is the leader in the PF/Checkbook Software
Market by a substantial margin. Intuit also owns the category
leader in personal tax preparation software (Turbo Tax, a
recently acquired product) and the co-leader in small business
accounting software (Quickbooks).

Relevant Product Market

14. Some 30% of households in the United States now have a home
personal computer (a "home PC"). The vast majority of home PCs
now being sold are IBM-compatible personal computers. All IBM-
compatible personal computers can run Microsoft's DOS or Windows
operating systems, and an overwhelming majority (well in excess
of 80%) now are being sold with a Microsoft operating system.
Because applications are written to work with specific operating
systems, applications programs for IBM-compatible personal
computers must, as a practical matter, be written to run on Windows
or, to a lesser, waning extent, on DOS without Windows.

15. One important application for home PCs is PF/Checkbook
software. Intuit's Quicken product was the number one selling
home PC software product in 1994, topping all others, including
even the most popular entertainment programs. PF/Checkbook
software is designed to give the home PC user electronic control
over an integrated set of personal finance records and
transactions. Currently, the core integrated functions of
PF/Checkbook software products include an "electronic
checkbook," which automates check writing and check register
record keeping, household budgeting, personal asset and
liability tracking and reporting, including features such as
loan tracking, stock and bond portfolio tracking, home
inventories, cash and retirement account tracking and personal
financial statements, and "front end" software for automated
bill-paying in association with a bill-paying service. The term
"front end" means that only the initiating part of the function
resides in home PC software. To complete the function, there
must also be a communication channel or "switch" (usually a
service using the telephone network) and a "back end,"
consisting of software and associated equipment at the other end
of the line to receive and process each transaction (in this
example, the other end of the line would be located at a bill-
paying service, but for home banking it would be at the bank).

16. Importantly, the checkbook, automated bill paying, asset
tracking and other
functions in PF/Checkbook software are linked together so that
transactions are automatically accounted for wherever affected
assets appear in the program. That integration allows the
consumer to track all transactions across account, financial and
tax files.

17. The core functions of PF/Checkbook software have increased in
both number and quality over the past several years, as
Microsoft and Intuit have battled to attract new customers
through better and more useful products. Competition to improve
old functions and to add new
ones is an important part of the rivalry between Intuit and
Microsoft.

18. There has been substantial innovation in the market for
Personal Finance/Checkbook software. Within the past year, a
potentially important new function, front end software for home
banking, has been developed and incorporated into some
PF/Checkbook software products. Microsoft's 1994 release of
Microsoft Money (version 3.0) included a home banking feature. This
year, Intuit plans to add home banking in its 1995 release of
Quicken
products. As with the functions discussed above, home banking is
linked to the rest of the program so that home banking
transactions are accounted for automatically wherever affected
assets appear in the program.

19. PF/Checkbook software is targeted principally for sale to
owners of home PCs. It is sold through two major distribution
channels, the "OEM channel" and the "retail channel." The OEM
channel consists of personal computer manufacturers who pre-
install operating systems and applications programs on their
personal computers. The retail channel consists both of sales
through retail stores that sell software products and direct
sales to consumers who order from a catalog or over telephone
lines.

20. PF/Checkbook software for IBM-compatible personal computers
(the PF/Checkbook Software Market) is a relevant product market
under the Clayton Act. PF/Checkbook software offers a group of
linked features that make it a superior product for personal
financial asset tracking and for which there are no close
substitutes. Purchasers and potential purchasers of IBM-
compatible PF/Checkbook software would not turn to any alternate
product if the price of PF/Checkbook software increased by a
small but significant amount.

Relevant Geographic Market

21. The relevant geographic market is the United States.
Monetary, language, financial industry, and other differences
outside the United States prevent PF/Checkbook software products
suitable for other foreign markets from being reasonable
substitutes for a U.S. version.

Competition and Entry

22. The principal competitors in the PF/Checkbook Software Market
are Intuit with Quicken and Microsoft with Money. H&R Block
Financial's "Managing Your Money" and Computer Associates'
"Simply Money" also are sold in the market, but have little
competitive significance. Managing Your Money was a significant
participant several years ago, but its importance as a
competitive influence has declined. The product recently has
been offered for sale by H&R Block at least partly as a result
of the announcement of the proposed Intuit acquisition.
Similarly, Computer Associates, a major supplier of mainframe
computer software, attempted unsuccessfully to enter and
establish a meaningful presence in the market by "giving away"
more than a million free copies of Simply Money for only a
shipping and handling charge. A low percentage of "free copy"
recipients actually use the software and Computer Associates has
little, if any, competitive influence in the market.

23. The PF/Checkbook Software Market is highly concentrated.
Quicken's unit market share of 1994 sales was about 69%.
Microsoft Money's unit share was about 22%. Unit shares for
Managing Your Money and Simply Money were less than 5% each.
From a 1994 revenue perspective, Quicken's lead in the market
was even more substantial: Quicken, 85%; Microsoft Money, 7%;
Managing Your Money, 5%; and Simply Money, 2%.

24. Entry into the PF/Checkbook Software Market is difficult.
Between them, Intuit and Microsoft control more than 90% of the
market, and both are daunting competitors in the market. A
substantial installed user base with an established, successful
product (such as Intuit's seven million customer installed base
for Quicken) creates a revenue stream of profitable upgrade
sales to the installed base. The upgrade revenue stream can
justify low initial pricing by market leaders with a proven
product, particularly in the OEM market. Such pricing, and
the
prospect of such pricing, discourages new entry, because a
potential competitor with an unproven product would know that it
would at best be faced with years of losses, with no assurance
of ever generating enough upgrade revenue to recoup its losses.
Writing adequate software "code" even to match today's
successful products would be no easy task--as witnessed by
Microsoft's own four-year effort to achieve feature parity with
Quicken. Even with the code, entry into the PF/Checkbook
Software Market would be difficult, expensive and slow.
Microsoft's own attempt to enter the market with its Microsoft
Money product has been slow and expensive. After four years, it
still has not achieved a positive return on its investment, but
has incurred substantial losses.

25. Most OEMs and retail customers in the PF/Checkbook Software
Market will purchase only products with an established
reputation for reliability, performance and customer support. At
a minimum, it takes years and a significant investment of
resources to build such a reputation.

26. In sum, a new competitor would not be likely to enter
successfully the PF/Checkbook Software Market within any
reasonable time with a product offering the core functions
necessary to compete effectively. No such entry could be
expected, within any reasonable time, to deter or counteract a
small but significant price increase resulting from the
acquisition.

The Proposed Acquisition

27. Microsoft has agreed to acquire all the stock of Intuit from
Intuit's shareholders in exchange for 1.336 shares of Microsoft
stock for each share of Intuit stock, with a minimum price of
$1.4 billion. If the transaction closed today, the price would
be approximately S2 billion. There is no ceiling on the purchase
price, which ultimately could be higher.

28. If the proposed acquisition of Intuit closes, Microsoft has
agreed to transfer to
Novell some of its Microsoft Money business assets-but not enough
to allow it to compete anywhere near the level provided by
Microsoft before the proposed Intuit acquisition. The transfer
to Novell would include only the Microsoft Money computer code,
associated intellectual property and documentation, the
Microsoft Money customer list and some technical
assistance from a few members of the Microsoft Money team during a
brief transition period. The Microsoft Money team itself,
including all product managers, developers, programmers and sales
and marketing personnel, apparently will remain with Microsoft.
In contrast, Microsoft has described the Intuit people as the
most important resource it will acquire if the transaction
closes. Novell had no plans to enter the PF/Checkbook Software
Market as an owner/developer of such software before Microsoft
offered Microsoft Money to it in connection with this proposed
transaction. Instead, Novell proposed to become a Quicken
customer, intending to resell Quicken as part of a package of
home computer software products.

29. Although Microsoft considered the Microsoft Money business to
be important enough to justify devoting significant resources--
many millions of dollars-as a business in its own right and as
the cornerstone of a significant emerging market, the up-front
purchase price to
be paid by Novell for those Microsoft Money assets that Microsoft
has agreed to transfer would
be zero. Novell would thereafter pay to Microsoft a ten percent
royalty on its first year of net sales of Money, which would be
less than a million dollars even if Novell were as successful as
Microsoft expected to be in 1995. To induce Novell to enter into
the proposed transaction, Microsoft has given Novell certain
other guarantees that could require Microsoft to pay millions of
dollars to Novell if it does not succeed with Money.

30. Before the proposed transaction was announced, part of the
vigorous competition between Intuit Quicken and Microsoft Money
was competition for OEM customers and for PC-based home banking
strategic allies. Microsoft has an existing business
relationship with two important OEMs, Packard-Bell and Gateway
2000. Both currently pre-install on their Home PCs
a "bundle" of Microsoft consumer applications software that
includes Microsoft Money. Shortly before the acquisition was
announced, Microsoft received a signed letter of intent from
MasterCard, under which Microsoft Money and derivative products
of Microsoft Money would have been used as part of a "Master
Banking" home banking program in a strategic alliance between
Microsoft and MasterCard. Both relationships were valuable to
Microsoft's Money business. The Microsoft Money relationships
with Packard-Bell, Gateway and MasterCard would be of critical
importance to Novell's ability to compete with Money. Microsoft
did not
agree to transfer those relationships to Novell, but agreed
instead not to use Quicken to compete with Novell in
relationships with Packard-Bell, Gateway or MasterCard through
March 1996.

Harm To Competition

31. The effect of the proposed acquisition of Intuit by Microsoft
may be substantially
to lessen competition in the PF/Checkbook Software Market.

32. Actual and potential competition between Microsoft and
Intuit, the two strongest and most significant competitors in
the PF/Checkbook Software Market, will be eliminated.
Competition from Novell against Quicken will be at best a weak
replacement for the lost competition from Microsoft. Microsoft,
the strongest competitor in the software industry, has the
resources, ability and resolve to challenge Intuit's leading
market position (in both the OEM and retail channels), while
Novell does not. Absent the acquisition, competition between
Quicken and Microsoft Money would increase. Microsoft's reason
for proposing the acquisition
of Intuit was its identification of the PF/Checkbook Software
Market as strategically important to Microsoft as a leading home PC
application today, as a front end for home banking tomorrow, and
as a front end more generally for on-line financial transactions
in the more distant future.

33. But for the proposed
acquisition, Microsoft would compete aggressively against Intuit
for sales in the PF/Checkbook Software Market. In fact,
Microsoft advised Intuit that Microsoft would substantially
increase its competitive efforts against Quicken if Intuit did
not
agree to be acquired. Microsoft's Executive Vice President
reported to Microsoft's Chairman:

        I tried to tell him [Intuit's Chairman] what else we
could do since we have decided this is such an important area
and we had not organized or staffed] adequately. I tried to tell
him how much we could do with a $1 billion. I tried to be non
threatening, but let him know we would do something
aggressively.

34. The proposed transaction would weaken Money
greatly, which would further enhance the dominance of Quicken in
Microsoft's hands. As a senior Microsoft official responsible for
Microsoft Money wrote in approximately June 1994:

        If we were to try to buy Intuit and had to sell our
offerings in [the core PF/Checkbook functions], who would be
willing to buy us out ant be a serious competitor. If it was
known that we were buying Intuit's offerings in [the core
PF/Checkbook functions], then I can at imagine anyone would be
stupid enough
too [sic]--not only would they be way, way far behind
competitively I think they would imagine that we'd never be
allowed to do it. (Emphasis supplied).

35. Potential new competitors, if any, would find it even more
daunting to compete against Quicken, the number one product in
the market, if it were in Microsoft's hands. Microsoft would
retain many of the advantages that made Microsoft Money a
powerful number two competitor against Quicken. Instead of using
those advantages to compete against Quicken, Microsoft would be
able to use the combined advantages of both to dominate
potential customers and strategic partners more thoroughly than
Intuit could do with Quicken or Microsoft could do with
Microsoft Money--especially if the two had to compete with each
other.

36. As spelled out in defendants' documents (quoted in Paragraphs
3 and 4), the proposed transaction creates an appreciable risk
that future PC-based home banking services will have to use a
Microsoft Quicken front end at higher prices than would prevail
in the absence of the acquisition.

37. Novell would be a substantially weaker competitor with Money
against Microsoft Quicken than Microsoft has been (and would
continue to be) against Intuit Quicken. For example, because of
the market power that Microsoft will acquire if the acquisition
is consummated and Novell's lack of comparable advantages,
MasterCard, Gateway and Packard-Bell, which Microsoft and Novell
agreed were crucial to Novell's ability to compete with Money in
the marketplace, will not commit to arrangements with Money in
Novell's hands that are comparable to the arrangements they had
or proposed to have with Microsoft Money.

38. Novell lacks important assets, resources and commitment to
the product that give Microsoft competitive strength with Money
and make the PF/Checkbook category strategically important to
Microsoft. Novell was not willing to pay any up-front purchase
price to obtain Money. The category is not as strategically
important to Novell as it is to Microsoft. Novell may ultimately
conclude not to continue funding the extended losses that would
be required,
with little chance of success, to compete vigorously enough to
provide price, quality and innovation discipline in the
PF/Checkbook Software Market comparable to Microsoft's
competition in the absence of the proposed acquisition.

39. Unless restrained, the proposed acquisition will violate
Section 7 of the Clayton Act.

Requested Relief

The United States requests (a) adjudication that Microsoft's
proposed acquisition of Intuit would violate Section 7 of the
Clayton Act, (b) preliminary and permanent injunctive relief
preventing consummation of the proposed acquisition, (c) an
award to the United States of the costs of this action, and (d)
such other relief as is just and proper.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FILES ANTITRUST SUIT TO CHALLENGE
MICROSOFT'S PURCHASE OF INTUIT

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The $2 billion deal planned by Microsoft
Corp. to buy Intuit Inc., which includes, "Quicken,"
the leader in personal finance software, was challenged today by
the Department of Justice when its Antitrust Division filed a
suit to block the merger on the grounds it would likely lead to
higher prices and lessened innovation in that market.

Intuit's Quicken is the leading personal finance software and the
Number One selling home personal computer software product with
a 1994 market share of almost 70 percent and more than 7 million
users. Microsoft's "Money" is the Number Two personal finance
competitor with a 1994 market share of about 22 percent and
about 1 million users. Between them, Intuit and Microsoft
accounted for more than 90 percent of personal finance software
sales in the United States in 1994.

Personal finance software is used by consumers at home on
personal computers to control their financial records and
transactions. In 1994, sales in that market reached nearly $90
million.

"Allowing Microsoft to buy a dominant position in this highly
concentrated market would likely result in higher prices for
consumers who want to buy personal finance software and would
cause those buyers to miss out on the huge benefits from
innovation," said Anne K. Bingaman, Assistant Attorney General in
charge of the Antitrust Division. "Moreover, Microsoft's control
of that market will give it a cornerstone asset that could be
used with its existing dominant position in operating systems
for personal computers to seize control of the markets of the
future, including PC-based home banking."

In an attempt to alleviate anticompetitive consequences,
Microsoft said it would transfer part, but not all, of its Money
assets, essentially at a zero purchase price, to Novell Inc., a
software developer headquartered in Provo, Utah. The complaint
alleges that this partial transfer to Novell would not be enough
to prevent the anticompetitive effects of the Intuit acquisition
since Novell could not be as effective a competitor with Money
as was Microsoft.

"This so-called fix just won't work. Novell simply can't replace
Microsoft--with its leading position in the personal computer
software industry--in competing against an entrenched, dominant
product like Intuit's Quicken," said Bingaman. "Also, keeping
Quicken independent, will allow others to team with
Quicken to compete in the emerging electronic commerce markets,
including home banking."

The Department filed its civil antitrust complaint in U.S.
District Court in San Francisco. It would prevent Microsoft,
headquartered in Redmond, Washington, and Intuit, headquartered
in Menlo Park, California, from consummating the proposed deal.

According to the complaint, both Microsoft and Intuit recognized
their combination would enable them to eliminate the substantial
competition between them in the personal finance/checkbook
software market and the emerging market for home banking. The
complaint quotes Intuit's chairman, Scott Cook, as saying to his
board of directors that the acquisition would eliminate "a
bloody share war" and allow for "enriched terms of trade." The
complaint also states that a Microsoft executive concluded: "As
a combination we would be dominant."

In its complaint, the Department also stressed that entry into
the personal finance software market is difficult. If Microsoft
were allowed to buy Intuit's Quicken, a new competitor would not
likely be able to enter the market within a reasonable amount of
time with a product that would be able to compete effectively in
the market, the Department said.

Two other products, H&R Block Financial's "Managing Your Money"
and Computer Associates' "Simply Money," are also sold in the
personal finance software market. They represent a total of
less than 10 percent of the market and have almost no competitive
significance, the Department said.

Personal finance/checkbook software products have a number of
core integrated functions, including: an electronic checkbook
with automated check writing, check register keeping and
household budgeting; personal asset and liability tracking and
reporting, cash and retirement account tracking and personal
financial reporting and statements; and automated bill paying in
conjunction with a bill-paying service. These core functions are
linked together so the consumer's records and transactions are
all automated and connected.

Intuit also makes a number of financial and productivity software
products, including, TurboTax and MacInTax tax software and
QuickBooks business accounting software. Microsoft does not
currently sell software products in these categories.

<P>On May 17, 1995, the United States Senate, by a vote of 96-3, adopted

Senate Resolution 120, which established the Special Committee to Investigate

Whitewater Development Corporation and Related Matters (hereinafter the "Special

Committee"), to be administered by the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban

Affairs (the "Banking Committee").  Resolution 120 charged the Special Committee

with the responsibility to conduct an extensive investigation into and to hold

public hearings on specified matters relating to the President's and Mrs.

Clinton's investment in Whitewater Development Corporation ("Whitewater") along

with James and Susan McDougal, Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association

("Madison Guaranty"), and related matters.  

<P>In discharging its responsibilities under Resolution 120, the Special

Committee deposed 274 witnesses and held 60 days of public hearings, during

which 136 witnesses testified.  The Committee also reviewed approximately 1

million pages of documents produced by the President and Mrs. Clinton, the White

House, various federal agencies, and a number of individual witnesses.

<P>Resolution 120 authorized the Committee to investigate and to hold public

hearings into three general subject areas.  Section 1(b)(1) authorized

investigation into whether White House officials engaged in improper conduct in

handling papers in Deputy White House Counsel Vincent Foster's office following

his death on July 20, 1993--the so-called Foster Phase of the Special

Committee's inquiry.

<P> With respect to the Washington Phase of the inquiry, Section 1(b)(2)

authorized investigation into whether the White House improperly interfered with

any investigations or prosecutions by various federal agencies relating to,

among other things, Whitewater, Madison Guaranty related entities, and Capital

Management Services, Inc. ("CMS").

<P>Finally, in the Arkansas Phase, &#167; 1(b)(3) of Resolution 120 authorized the

Special Committee to investigate, among other things, the activities of

Whitewater, Madison Guaranty, CMS, Lasater & Co., and the work and billing

practices of the Rose Law Firm relating to Madison Guaranty.

1.<P>The Foster Phase.

<P>During the 103d Congress, the Banking Committee, pursuant to Senate

Resolution 229, conducted an inquiry into the cause of Mr. Foster's death and

the conduct of the subsequent investigation of his death by the United States

Park Police.  On July 15, 1994, Special Counsel Robert B. Fiske, Jr. advised the

Banking Committee that "public hearings on the subject of the handling of

documents in Mr. Foster's office while this investigation is continuing could

prejudice our investigation."1  Accordingly, the Banking Committee's public

hearings on July 29, 1994 into the cause of Mr. Foster's death excluded inquiry

into the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office.

<P>At the conclusion of the Banking Committee's hearings in the summer of

1994, the  following matters, among others, were identified for future inquiry

relating to Mr. Foster's death:

<P>*<P>the White House interference into the Park Police search of Mr.

Foster's office;



<P>*<P>the presence of White House counsel staff during standard Park Police

investigatory interviews;



<P>*<P>the White House insistence that the Park Police investigation proceed

with Department of Justice involvement to the extent that DOJ was "calling the

shots" and "setting up protocol" and the Park Police were "stand[ing] and

waiting for permission to do our job"; and



<P>*<P>the late delivery of the note in Mr. Foster's office to Park Police,

discovered by White House counsel.2

<P>On April 22, 1995, Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr advised the

Chairman and Ranking Member of the Banking Committee that his investigation

would not be hindered or impeded by a Senate inquiry into the way in which White

House officials handled documents in Mr. Foster's office following his death.

<P>Accordingly, the Special Committee commenced its investigation and public

hearings into whether White House officials engaged in improper conduct in

handling documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death.  The Special

Committee recognizes that Mr. Foster's death remains a source of much grief to

his family and friends.  In conducting its inquiry under section 1(b)(1) of

Resolution 120, the Committee sought to balance carefully the need to protect

the privacy of the Foster family and its duty to carry out fully the mandate of

the Senate.

2.<P>The Washington Phase.

<P>Resolution 120 directed the Special Committee to review the handling of

several federal investigations relating to the Whitewater real estate venture;

Madison Guaranty McDougal's S&L, the failure of which cost American taxpayers

more than $60 million; and CMS, a small business investment company owned by

David Hale, who made illegal loans to James and Susan McDougal in part to

finance the Whitewater investment.  Specifically, section 1(b)(2) of the

Resolution authorized the Special Committee to conduct an investigation and

public hearings into the following matters:

<P>(A)<P>whether any person has improperly handled confidential Resolution

Trust Corporation ("RTC") information relating to Madison Guaranty or

Whitewater, including whether any person has improperly communicated such

information to individuals referenced therein;



<P>(B)<P>whether the White House has engaged in improper contacts with any

other agency or department in the Government with regard to confidential RTC

information relating to Madison Guaranty or Whitewater;



<P>(C)<P>whether the Department of Justice has improperly handled RTC

criminal referrals relating to Madison Guaranty or Whitewater;



<P>(D)<P>whether RTC employees have been improperly importuned, prevented,

restrained, or deterred in conducting investigations or making enforcement

recommendations relating to Madison Guaranty or Whitewater; and



<P>(E)<P>whether the report issued by the Office of Government Ethics on

July 31, 1994, or related transcripts of deposition testimony --



<P><P>(i)  were improperly released to White House officials or others prior

to their testimony before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs

pursuant to Senate Resolution 229 (103d Congress); or



<P><P>(ii)  were used to communicate to White House officials or to others

confidential RTC information relating to Madison Guaranty or Whitewater.3

<P>In conducting the inquiry mandated during this so-called "Washington Phase"

of the investigation, the Special Committee examined whether the President and

Mrs. Clinton -- or their agents -- misused the power of the presidency in

responding to a series of investigations of the Whitewater matter.  As in the

past, the Senate sought to serve as the public's watchdog, to expose abuses of

the public trust. 

<P>Of necessity, the Special Committee inquired into the investigative and

prosecutorial processes of Executive Branch agencies to determine whether the

laws were properly and faithfully executed.  Congress has a duty to investigate

allegations that the normal investigative and prosecutorial processes of the

Executive Branch have been compromised.4  More important, Congress has the

constitutional obligation to ensure that the President's private interests have

not been elevated above the public good.



3.<P>The Arkansas Phase.

<P>This is the beginning of the Whitewater matter.  In this phase of its

inquiry, the Senate charged the Special Committee with investigating the complex

web of intermingled funds, fraudulent transactions, political favors, and

conflicted relationships which comprise the "20 years of public life in

Arkansas" that Mrs. Clinton did not want an independent counsel, among others,

to look into.5

<P>Specifically, Section 1(b)(3) of Resolution 120 authorized an investigation

and public hearings into the following matters:

<P><P>(A)  the operations, solvency, and regulation of Madison Guaranty

Savings & Loan Association, and any subsidiary, affiliate, or other entity owned

or controlled by Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association;



<P><P>(B)  the activities, investments, and tax liability of Whitewater

Development Corporation and, as related to Whitewater Development Corporation,

of its officers, directors, and shareholders;



<P><P>(C)  the policies and practices of the RTC and the Federal banking

agencies (as that term is defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance

Act) regarding the legal representation of such agencies with respect to Madison

Guaranty Savings and Loan Association;



<P><P>(D)  the handling by the RTC, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Savings and Loan

Insurance Corporation of civil or administrative actions against parties

regarding Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan Association.



<P><P>(E)  the sources of funding and the lending practices of Capital

Management Services, Inc., and its supervision and regulation by the Small

Business Administration, including any alleged diversion of funds to Whitewater

Development Corporation;



<P><P>(F)  the bond underwriting contracts between Arkansas Development

Finance Authority and Lasater & Company; and 



<P><P>(G)  the lending activities of Perry County Bank, Perryville,

Arkansas, in connection with the 1990 Arkansas gubernatorial election.

<P>These various subjects, seemingly disparate, are nevertheless woven

together by common and recurring themes of abuse of power, fraud on federal

institutions and theft of public funds, and frequent neglect, if not deliberate

disregard, of professional, ethical, and, at times, legal standards.

<P>*  *  *

<P>The Special Committee completed its task under Resolution 120 in a

bipartisan manner.  With few notable exceptions, the Special Committee conducted

its investigation and public hearings by mutual consent between the Chairman and

Ranking Member, thus obviating the need for votes by the Special Committee.

<P>Because the testimony of witnesses before the Special Committee was often

contradictory, incomplete, or inaccurate as to important events and actions, the

Committee placed particular emphasis on available documentary evidence. 

Unfortunately, throughout its inquiry, the Committee was hindered by parties

unduly delaying the production of, or withholding outright, documents critical

to its investigation.  Although the White House was most often and most notably

engaged in this course of action, the pattern of noncooperation extended to

other parties, as this Report lays out more fully in the Washington Phase of the

Special Committee's inquiry.

<P>This Report of the Special Committee is divided into three separate but

interrelated parts.  Part 1 focusses on the Foster Phase of the inquiry, into

whether White House officials engaged in improper conduct in the handling of

documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death.  Part 2 summarizes

the Special Committee's investigation into the Washington Phase and discusses

the handling of federal investigations into Whitewater and related matters, the

Administration's attempts to interfere with these investigations, and the White

House's attempts to interfere with Congressional inquiries into the

Administration's alleged improprieties.  Part 3 centers on the Arkansas Phase

and details the transactions and activities that comprise Governor Clinton's web

of political, personal, and business relationships--a web that includes, among

others, Whitewater, Madison, CMS, James McDougal, David Hale, and Danny Ray

Lasater.  Each Part begins with a separate, detailed outline and concludes with

respective endnotes.

<P>These three parts are interrelated because the entire story of Whitewater

is not simply the sum of its parts.  Rather, seeping through the pages that

follow are clearly identifiable patterns of motivation, conduct, and, at times,

concealment.  Beyond discrete judgments of impropriety in particular instances,

therefore, the Special Committee has examined the evidence and reached

conclusions that transcend any individual persons, actions, or events but rather

illuminate patterns of conduct behind the Whitewater affair.

<P>The Conclusions of the Special Committee are summarized at the beginning of

each Part.  They do not answer all questions and allegations that have surfaced,

but, taken together, they provide a comprehensive survey of the facts uncovered

by the Special Committee in its 13 months of investigation.  And they offer a

full, fair, and often troubling picture of the inner workings of government that

the Senate, by an overwhelming mandate, charged the Special Committee to present

to the American people.

States, knowingly and willfully falsified, concealed and covered up by
trick, scheme and device, a material fact, and knowingly and willfully

1990.

<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>On April 28, 1996, President Clinton testified behind closed doors for 4 hours as a defense witness in the trial of two of his partners in the failed Whitewater real estate deal.</P>

<P>Clinton, who is not accused of any wrongdoing in this proceeding, recorded his testimony on videotape at the White House for viewing later in the trial of James and Susan McDougal, who are charged with bank fraud and conspiracy.</P>

<P>The Clintons entered into a partnership with the McDougals in the Whitewater real estate venture in 1978. Although their investment lost money, questions have arisen about whether funds for the project were siphoned from the Madison Savings and Loan Association, which was also a McDougal holding.</P>

<P>The following is a transcript of the deposition.</P>
<HR WIDTH=525 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>Whitewater Trial - Pres. Clinton Video Deposition Transcript</B></P>

<P>The transcript from President Clinton's videotaped testimony at the fraud and conspiracy trial of James and Susan McDougal and  Gov. Jim Guy Tucker in Little Rock, Ark.:</P>

<P>JAMES MCDOUGAL ATTORNEY SAM HEUER: Please state your name.</P>

<P>A: Bill Clinton.</P>

<P>Q: What is your occupation at this time?</P>

<P>A: President of the United States.</P>

<P>Q: President Clinton, please tell the jury about your career leading up to the point in time that you became President of the United States.</P>

<P>A: Well, I graduated from law school in 1973 and I went home to Arkansas, and I found a position teaching at the university. And I was there from 1973 until I assumed office as Attorney General in 1977, January.</P>

<P>During that time, I ran for Congress and lost, I married my wife, and then made a successful race for attorney general. In 1978, I was elected governor; in 1980, our daughter was born and I was defeated for governor. And I practiced law for a time, and then in 1982, I was re-elected governor. I served as governor from 1982 until I was elected president in 1992.</P>

<P>Shortly after I was elected president, I resigned the office and the lieutenant governor, now Governor Tucker, became governor.  And you know the rest.</P>

<P>Q: Mr. President, do you know defendant James McDougal?</P>

<P>A: I do.</P>

<P>Q: Please tell the jury when and how you got to know Mr. McDougall</P>

<P>A: We met, oh, about 30 years ago when he was running Senator Fulbright's office in Little Rock and I was a student at Georgetown working for Senator Fulbright part-time on the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee here in Washington.</P>

<P>Q: Was there ever a time when Mr. McDougal worked for you  while you served as governor of the state of Arkansas?</P>

<P>A: Yes, there was. In my first term, he was my economic development liaison. He had a lot of important responsibilities. worked with the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission, he worked with other agencies that dealt with economic matters. He  was kind of a troubleshooter on projects designed to advance our economy and get more jobs for our people. And he worked for -  not the entire first term, not the whole two years, but for most of the two-year period between '79 and '80 he was working in the Governor's office.</P>

<P>Q: Have you ever been engaged in a business relationship with Mr. McDougal?</P>

<P>A: Yes. We had two.</P>

<P>Q: Would you please tell the jury about those?</P>

<P>A: In 1977, Mr. McDougal, who was - at that time had been, I think, for some time, engaged in various real estate development projects, asked me if I wanted to invest a small amount of money  in one in Pulaski County. And I did, I invested, as I recall, about $2,800 for about a year and a half, and I liquidated the investment and made about $5,000. So I had a profit of $2,100, it was a nice profit.</P>

<P>Then after that, Mr. McDougal invited Hillary and I to invest with Jim and Susan in 230 acres of land in Marion County which  was unimproved land near the White River, and is now called  Whitewater land. And we did that. And we invested in that in 1978, and I was in that investment until 1992.</P>

<P>Q: Were you aware of Mr. McDougal's purchase and ownership of  a savings and loan in Little Rock, Arkansas in the 1980s?</P>

<P>A: Yes. I became aware at some point that he bought a savings and loan, I think it was maybe in Woodruff County, and then got permission to move it down to Little Rock in the early 1980s.</P>

<P>Q: Mr. President, did you ever have any loan relationship with Mr. McDougal's savings and loan known as Madison Guaranty concerning your investments?</P>

<P>A: No, sir, I did not, I never borrowed any money from Madison Guaranty.</P>

<P>Q: Did you ever cause anybody to borrow any money for your benefit, Mr. President?</P>

<P>A: No, I did not.</P>

<P>Q: Did you ever have any personal loan with Madison Guaranty at any time, Mr. President?</P>

<P>A: No, sir, I didn't.</P>

<P>Q: Did you ever campaign with or for Jim McDougal?</P>

<P>A: I did once. Mr. McDougal had, as I said, worked for Senator Fulbright, that's what he was doing when I met him 30 years ago, and had supported others who ran, but in 1982, he, himself, ran for Congress in the third congressional district, the same district where I had run eight years earlier in 1974. And it was also in that year that, as I said previously, I ran for governor. Having been defeated in 1980, I was trying to get back in office. He won the Democratic primary, and after a very difficult battle, so did I.</P>

<P>And so, in the general election, from time to time we would be together when the Democratic Party would sponsor rallies in that part of the state, I would be there, he would be there, we would be campaigning together, we would be endorsing each other, and it  was an interesting campaign. But I remember that, I think - I think that's the only time.</P>

<P>Q: Are you familiar with a former judge of Arkansas who now lives in Conway called Jim Johnson?</P>

<P>A: Yes, I am.</P>

<P>Q: During the time that you served as governor of Arkansas, Mr. President, was Mr. Johnson a supporter of yours?</P>

<P>A: Oh, no.</P>

<P>Q: Mr. President, please characterize your relationship with Justice Jim Johnson while you were in politics in the state of Arkansas, sir.</P>

<P>A: I think a fair characterization would be that it was one of opposition, both his opposition to me and my opposition to him.  The first campaign I worked in, I supported a candidate for governor who was running against Justice Johnson, that was 1966. In 1968, Justice Johnson ran against Senator Fulbright, and I, along with Mr. McDougal, worked against him then, in that we had severe differences of opinion, and I vividly remember his characterization of Senator Fulbright was soft on communism, for example, it was that sort of emotional aspect to the campaign.</P>

<P>Then at some point in the 1980s, after I became governor, Justice Jim Johnson became a Republican, and therefore, more explicitly opposed to me. Now, if you would see him on the street, he would be just as friendly as could be, you know, and you would have a cordial conversation, but I was never under any illusions that - he and I were basically polar opposites in terms of what we thought was good for our state, good for our people, and good for our future.</P>

<P>And then when I ran for president, he was exceedingly active with some of the extremist groups that were stirring up negative stories about me, my record as governor, and indeed trying to create an impression of our state that was unfavorable. So, there is almost an unbroken strand of opposition between me and Jim Johnson that starts in 1966 and ends in 1992.</P>

<P>And I don't suppose it has ended, but at least that was the last dramatic chapter in his vigorous involvement in the machine, that sort of publicity machine against my candidacy for president in 1992.</P>

<P>Q: Has he continued to criticize you since you have obtained the office of president of the United States?</P>

<P>A: I think he has, but to be honest, I haven't paid a lot of attention to it.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. If you would, please, describe your relationship with Jim McDougal in the 1980s.</P>

<P>A: Well, in the early '80s, I didn't see Jim much in the first couple of years, because he didn't live in Little Rock. But sometime after his race for Congress, which was 1982, sometime after that, maybe 1983, he moved to Little Rock, he had purchased the savings and loan, he had moved the S&L to Little Rock, he set it up in downtown Little Rock, less than a mile from the Governor's mansion. So, after he moved there and began to get active in trying to rebuild that neighborhood and establish relationships in the community, I would see him more frequently.</P>

<P>Q: Are you familiar with a former municipal judge by the name of David Hale?</P>

<P>A: Yes, I am.</P>

<P>Q: Please tell the jury when you became acquainted with him.</P>

<P>A: I think I met David Hale sometime in the mid-1970s, and I believe it had something to do with the Jaycees. He had - at some time in that period, he was the national president for the Jaycees, he was from Arkansas. I was a member of the chapter at Fayetteville, and as a candidate for office, I would, from time to time, go to the conventions of the Jaycees. So, I believe I met him at one of those, somehow in connection with his Jaycee activities.</P>

<P>Q: Did you ever have a business relationship with Mr. Hale, either personally or through his company, known as Capital Management Services?</P>

<P>A: No.</P>

<P>Q: Did you ever receive any loan from Mr. Hale personally or from his business known as Capital Management Services?</P>

<P>A: No, I didn't.</P>

<P>Q: You said earlier that you ran for political office in Arkansas in 1976, I believe; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: Yes, 1976, I was a candidate for attorney general. I won the Democratic primary, and the only time in my life I had no Republican opposition, so I was elected.</P>

<P>Q: Did you ever ask Mr. Hale at that time to serve as your campaign manager?</P>

<P>A: No, I didn't do that. Now, let me say, Mr. Heuer, to make a full disclosure, if, in fact, I saw David Hale in 1976, I knew that he was an active Jaycee, I'm certain that I asked him for his support if I saw him. I asked every person I saw in the first half of 1976 to support me and do whatever they could for me. So, I'm certain - I'm sure if I did see him, I asked him to help me, but I didn't ask him to be my campaign manager.</P>

<P>Q: Was your opponent George Jernigan at that time?</P>

<P>A: Yes, George Jernigan was one of my opponents. George Jernigan and Clarence Cash were my opponents.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. In late '85 or 1986, were you aware of any plans that Mr. Hale had to increase a capital base in his business known as Capital Management Services?</P>

<P>A: No, I wasn't.</P>

<P>Q: Are you familiar with an office that Jim McDougal established sometime in 1986 in the south part of Pulaski County on property that was commonly referred to as Castle Grande Estates?</P>

<P>A: I know Mr. McDougal in 1986 had an office on 145th Street</P>

<P>Q: That's the same.</P>

<P>A: - at south Pulaski County. I don't know if that's the same place, but I know he had an office out there.</P>

<P>Q: Did you ever visit him on 145th Street?</P>

<P>A: Yes, I did, one time.</P>

<P>Q: And tell me, you were known in Little Rock to enjoy jogging; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: I did, I did then, I do now.</P>

<P>Q: Tell the jury if you've ever jogged from the mansion to Mr. McDougal's office on 145th Street at any time.</P>

<P>A: No, sir, I didn't do that. In fact, I couldn't have done that.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. When you visited Mr. McDougal at his office on this singular occasion, were you wearing jogglng shoes?</P>

<P>A: No. I was dressed up, I had a shirt and tie on, coat and tie. I remember the day quite well, because I was going to a Siemens-Allison plant, it is a big German plant, they make electrical motors in Arkansas, and they had announced an expansion of the plant. They were going to hire about 200 more people, as I recall, and they were good jobs, and we needed them, and I had worked hard on that, and I was looking forward to the day. And I had never been out that way before. I thought I had been on every road in the state, but to the best of my knowledge, I had never been out that way before.</P>

<P>And Mr. McDougal's office was in a trailer, as I recall, on the way out there. And I stopped there for a few minutes, either going to this event or coming from this event, but I don't remember, to be honest, whether I was going to or coming from, I just know I stopped there.</P>

<P>Q: Do you remember what date that was?</P>

<P>A: I have refreshed my memory by resorting to my own records, and I know now it was in June of 1986.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. What was the weather like, if you recall?</P>

<P>A: Well, as I recall, it was warm. It normally is in Arkansas in June, and I remember it was a sunny day, because we - I remember that from the Siemens-Allison event.</P>

<P>Q: Was anyone with you at that time?</P>

<P>A: I believe Bob Nash was with me, because he was my principal economic development aide, and then the trooper who was assigned to duty that day was driving us.</P>

<P>Q: Did you have any contact in any shape, form, or fashion with David Hale at that visit to</P>

<P>A: No, I didn't. He wasn't there.</P>

<P>Q: All right. Were you ever present in Mr. McDougal's office on 145th Street when a discussion occurred about financial assistance from David Hale or his Capital Management Services Company involving any other business that you or Mr. McDougal may have had?</P>

<P>A: No, sir, never.</P>

<P>Q: Were you ever present at any time for any meeting between Jim McDougal and David Hale?</P>

<P>A: Never, I never was present at any meeting.</P>

<P>Q: Were you ever present when there was any discussion of getting any kind of loan from David Hale or his SBIC?</P>

<P>A: No.</P>

<P>Q: Did you ever make a statement that your name could not appear on any loan documents or financial documents related to any type of loan from David Hale or his SBIC?</P>

<P>A: Absolutely not.</P>

<P>Q: Did you ever get assurance from Jim McDougal that your name would be secreted from any loan documents pertaining to any loan from David Hale or his SBIC?</P>

<P>A: No, we never had any conversation about it at all.</P>

<P>Q: Did you ever tell David Hale that you had property in Marion County, Arkansas, that you could use as collateral or security for a loan from him?</P>

<P>A: I did not do that, no.</P>

<P>Q: Did you ever ask David Hale to make you a loan?</P>

<P>A: No.</P>

<P>Q: Did you ever ask David Hale to make Jim McDougal a loan?</P>

<P>A: No.</P>

<P>Q: Did you ever ask David Hale to make Susan McDougal a loan?</P>

<P>A: No, I didn't.</P>

<P>Q: Did you ever ask David Hale to make Jim Guy Tucker a loan?</P>

<P>A: No.</P>

<P>Q: Did you ever, in any shape, form or fashion, put any pressure on David Hale for the purpose of obtaining a loan or for the purpose of causing him to make loans through his SBIC?</P>

<P>A: I did not put any pressure on David Hale.</P>

<P>Q: Do you have any idea what he is talking about in regard to these loans that he has come up with?</P>

<P>A: No, sir. I tried to keep - he has told two or three different versions of this, and I've tried to keep up with these different stories, but all I know is that any suggestion that I tried to get any money from him or I tried to keep that a secret or I put any pressure on him, these things are simply not true, they didn't happen.</P>

<P>Q: In late 1985 or early 1986, were you aware or made known of any purported agreement whereby Madison Guaranty Savings  and Loan would advance money to Mr. Hale or his company in some shape, form, or fashion as agreed to between Mr. Hale and Jim McDougal whereby Mr. Hale would then make loans to various people?</P>

<P>A: That was a long question, Mr. Heuer.</P>

<P>Q: I understand.</P>

<P>A: It has got a short answer. No, I didn't know anything about Mr. Hale's financial business.</P>

<P>Q: And the same question for Susan McDougal?</P>

<P>A: No, I did not.</P>

<P>Q: Or Jim Guy Tucker?</P>

<P>A: No, I did not.</P>

<P>Q: Did you ever have any conversation with Jim McDougal wherein you were led to believe that you and Mr. McDougal could obtain financing or money from David Hale at any time?</P>

<P>A: No, Jim McDougal never talked to me about anything like that.</P>

<P>Q: Did you ever have any meetings with Jim McDougal at the governor's mansion in January of 1986?</P>

<P>A: We did have a meeting in January of 1986.</P>

<P>Q: And what was the topic of that meeting?</P>

<P>A: Well, it was more than 10 years ago, and I have had a lot of meetings. But my memory is that Jim wanted to talk to me about his concern that the state Health Department was not treating him fairly at one of his developments; not the Whitewater Development, he had another land operation. And as I recall, the area being developed was not connected to a municipal sewer system, so that in order to sell these lots and put houses on them, they had to have septic tanks there, and they had to get a permit.</P>

<P>And I have a clear memory that he believed that the people the Health Department had assigned to look into this were not giving him fair treatment, and in fact, one of them was actively trying to undermine his attempt to sell this property to others. And he was upset about it, and he actually gave me a memorandum about it, you know, just outlining one or two items, and he asked me to look into it. And I did, I subsequently arranged for him to have a meeting about it.</P>

<P>Q: In that meeting, Mr. President, did there ever come a point where a discussion was had with you and Mr. McDougal about any plans involving David Hale providing financing in any shape, form, or fashion?</P>

<P>A: No, sir, it didn't - we didn't discuss that.</P>

<P>MR. HEWER: Your Honor, I would pass the witness at this time.</P>

<P>THE COURT: Mr. Collins or Mr. Brown?</P>

<P>MR. COLLINS: Mr. Brown, Your Honor.</P>

<P>MR. BROWN: Thank you, Your Honor. If the Court pleases, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, and Mr. President.</P>

<P>THE WITNESS: Mr. Brown.</P>

<P>EXAMINATION ON BEHALF OF GOV. JIM GUY TUCKER  BY MR. BROWN:</P>

<P>Q: I will try to be as brief as I can and as precise as I can in asking you these questions. If I am unclear, please ask me to repeat the question.</P>

<P>Mr. President, do you know Jim Guy Tucker?</P>

<P>A: I do.</P>

<P>Q: And when did you first meet Jim Guy Tucker, Governor Tucker?</P>

<P>A: I believe I met the governor almost 30 years ago here in Washington. I believe the first time I ever met him was in Senator Fulbright's office in the late '60s, and if my memory is correct, I believe that he had finished Harvard and was on his way to Vietnam as a war correspondent, or had just come back from Vietnam. And of course, after that, he went home to Arkansas, and then after I finished law school, I did, so I have known him ever since then. But I believe that's the first time I met him.</P>

<P>Q: All right. Can you describe your relationship with Governor Tucker over the years?</P>

<P>A: Well, it has changed a little from time to time.</P>

<P>Q: All right. I'll get you to tell us about that?</P>

<P>A: When I - first of all, I was very impressed with him when I first met him, and I liked him. But then he went home to Arkansas and I went - I went away, I lived in England for a couple of years and I went to law school. But while I was in law school, he was elected to prosecutor for Pulaski County. And then when I came  home and made my race for Congress in 1974, that was the same year  Mr. Tucker ran for attorney general.</P>

<P>After he was elected attorney general and I was defeated for Congress and went back to teaching in the Arkansas Law School,  he asked me to prepare for him an anti-trust brief on an issue involving the banking and interest rates in Arkansas that he wanted to file on behalf of our state before the U.S. Supreme Court. I prepared that brief, and in the course of doing it, had a lot more contact with him, and we became better friends.</P>

<P>In 1975, late '75, when Hillary and I were married, we had a private wedding ceremony, but we had a larger party that night,  and I invited Jim Guy to the party and I remember he flew up there to the party. Then in 1976, there was an opening for Congress in Little Rock, he ran for that job and got elected, and I ran for his job, I became attorney general. And again, we had a good relationship.</P>

<P>And in 1978, when he ran for the United States Senate after the death of Senator McClellan, along with Senator Pryor and Congressman Thornton, I ran for the governorship, and I was  elected governor. He lost the Senate race, and he basically devoted himself after that, nearly as I could tell, to his own business interests and his law practice. So, I didn't see him so much then, but we were still friendly.</P>

<P>Then in 1982, after I was defeated for governor in 1980, I ran for re-election in '82 in a very crowded Democratic primary field which included Governor Tucker. So, we ran against each other for the first and, thank goodness, the only time in our careers. It was a very difficult, very heated race, and it left some hard feelings. I was lucky enough to win it. But we were sort of estranged after that.</P>

<P>Although I always respected the way he handled it, he continued to support the Democratic Party, he continued to stand up for the things that I believed in, and from time to time, he even made contributions to my campaign. But we weren't really close. It got a little better as time went on, you know, time often heals some of those wounds, it got a little better.</P>

<P>Q: I understand.</P>

<P>A: Then in 1990, there was another brief period of tension, because Governor Tucker was considering running for governor  and I was considering running for re-election. As it turned out, I ran for re-election, he ran for lieutenant governor, and we began to serve together. In my view, he had a hard job, because when I started running for president, under the Arkansas constitution, he is the governor, the lieutenant governor is the governor with all the powers of the office. So, I have had a cordial relationship with him since then.</P>

<P>Q: Now, Mr. President, understanding your relationship historically with Governor Tucker, particularly as it related to the political aspects of it, have you ever had any business relationships with Governor Tucker?</P>

<P>A: No, Mr. Brown, I never have.</P>

<P>Q: Now, let me focus, if you will, in the year 1985 and 1986. Were you ever aware that David Hale, in fact, had a company  called Capital Management Systems? Were you ever made aware of that, Capital Management System -</P>

<P>A: I don't know.</P>

<P>MR. HEWER: Services.</P>

<P>BY MR. BROWN:</P>

<P>Q: Services, excuse me, I'm sorry, Services.</P>

<P>A: I don't know. My guess is that I did not know that he had a company by that exact name.</P>

<P>Q: All right.</P>

<P>A: I knew that David - I want to make a full disclosure here.</P>

<P>Q: Okay.</P>

<P>A: I believe I knew that David Hale had a business of some kind, or was in business, as well as being a municipal judge, but I don't believe I knew that was the name of his company or what that company was, exactly.</P>

<P>Q: Well, apparently I had some problems repeating the name of that company, too. But it is Capital Management Services. Let me ask you this question: Did you ever request David Hale or any of his companies to make a loan to or for the benefit of Governor Tucker, to the best of your knowledge?</P>

<P>A: I did not.</P>

<P>Q: Are you aware of whether or not there was ever any agreement of any kind involving Governor Tucker, David Hale and Jim McDougal which concerned the making of loans for the  mutual benefit of these persons or other persons?</P>

<P>A: If there ever was such an agreement, I had no awareness of it.</P>

<P>Q: Are you aware of whether or not there was ever any agreement of any kind involving Governor Tucker and David Hale through any of his companies which had the intent of increasing the capital of David Hale's small business investment company or any company that he might have been associated with?</P>

<P>A: If there was an agreement like that, I didn't know anything about it.</P>

<P>Q: Did Governor Tucker ever ask you to do anything at any time to help him obtain loans from David Hale or any of his companies?</P>

<P>A: No, sir, he did not ever ask for that kind of help.</P>

<P>Q: Did he ever ask you to do anything at any time to help obtain loans for any of Governor Tucker's companies?</P>

<P>A: No.</P>

<P>Q: All right. And I guess this question has been asked, but since we represent different individuals, I need to ask you this question as it relates to Governor Tucker.</P>

<P>Q: Did you ever pressure David Hale to do anything at any time to benefit - or for the benefit of Governor Jim Guy Tucker?</P>

<P>A: I did not.</P>

<P>Q: In late 1985 and early 1986, were you aware of whether or not there was ever any agreement involving Governor Tucker and  David Hale and Jim McDougal involving Madison Guaranty loans in  exchange for loans from David Hale's company, CMS, that we have referred  to?</P>

<P>A: I was aware of no such agreement. I did not -</P>

<P>Q: Did you ever have -- excuse me.</P>

<P>A: I want to make sure I made myself clear.</P>

<P>Q: All right.</P>

<P>A: I was not aware of that agreement if, in fact, it existed. If there was an agreement, I knew nothing about it.</P>

<P>Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, did you ever have any conversation with Governor Tucker, in which he informed you that he would be arranging a loan through Madison Guaranty  Savings and Loan which would enable David Hale to make loans to various other people?</P>

<P>A: No, sir, I never did.</P>

<P>MR. BROWN: Mr. President, I have no further questions.</P>

<P>THE WITNESS: Thank you.</P>

<P>THE COURT: Mr. McDaniel?</P>

<P>MR. McDANIEL: Yes, Your Honor.</P>

<P>THE COURT: Do you need a break?</P>

<P>MR. McDANIEL: I'm not going to be very long, Your Honor. At  your will, we can either proceed or at the conclusion of my questioning, I will defer.</P>

<P>THE COURT: All right. Why don't you proceed?</P>

<P>MR. McDANIEL: Thank you, Your Honor.</P>

<P>EXAMINATION ON BEHALF OF SUSAN McDOUGAL BY  MR. McDANIEL:</P>

<P>Q: Good afternoon, Mr. President.</P>

<P>A: Good afternoon, Mr. McDaniel.</P>

<P>Q: We have been introduced, and I'm Bobby McDaniel, and along with Jennifer Horan, the federal public defender, represent Susan McDougall And in that regard, I would like to ask you, do you  know Susan?</P>

<P>A: I do.</P>

<P>Q: Can you tell us, sir, when and how did you meet Susan?</P>

<P>A: I met Susan through her relationship with Jim, I met them before they married, and if my memory serves me right, I think he taught a course at Ouachita University in Arkadelphia, and I believe she was a student there, I think that's how they met. But anyway, we met, therefore, it would have been somewhere either  in the late '60s or the early '70s, some time in that area.</P>

<P>Q: All right, sir. To get right to the point, Mr. President - A: And let me -</P>

<P>Q: All right, sir.</P>

<P>A: Also, they invited me to their wedding, I remember that, it was outside out in west Little Rock some place, or west of Little Rock some place, and I remember being there.</P>

<P>Q: All right, sir. And as I say, to get right to the point, Mr. President, did vou ever request David Hale to make a loan to Susan McDougal?</P>

<P>A: No, sir, I did not.</P>

<P>Q: Mr. President, did you ever in any way try to pressure David Hale directly or indirectly, to make a loan to Susan McDougal?</P>

<P>A: I did not pressure David Hale to do that.</P>

<P>Q: All right, sir. And I want to focus for a minute on a time frame late 1985, early 1986, and again, we represent separate defendants, and it may be cumulative, but bear with me, I will be brief. Were you aware of any alleged agreement whereby - involving Susan McDougal and David Hale, involving loans that would be made with Madison Guaranty in exchange for loans being made for David Hale's company? Did you have any knowledge of any such agreement, if it existed?</P>

<P>A: If it did exist, I didn't know anything about it.</P>

<P>Q: Mr. President, likewise, in reference to that same time frame, early '85 - late '85, early '86, were you aware of any alleged agreement involving Jim Guy Tucker, Jim McDougal, David Hale, or Susan McDougal, involving Madison Guaranty loans in exchange for loans from David Hale's company?</P>

<P>A: No, sir.</P>

<P>Q: Were you aware in 1986 that on April 3rd, 1986 David Hale's small business investment company, Capital Management Services, made a $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal doing business as Master Marketing? Were you aware of that in 1986?</P>

<P>A: No, Mr. McDaniel, I was not.</P>

<P>Q: Mr. President, did you ever discuss a $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal with David Hale in any way?</P>

<P>A: I did not.</P>

<P>Q: Mr. President, did you urge David Hale to make any such loan?</P>

<P>A: No.</P>

<P>Q: Did you ever discuss a $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal from David Hale with Jim McDougal?</P>

<P>A: No.</P>

<P>Q: Did you ever discuss a $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal from David Hale with Susan McDougal?</P>

<P>A: I did not.</P>

<P>Q: Did you receive any of the proceeds from a $300,000 loan made to Susan McDougal by David Hale's company?</P>

<P>A: I did not receive any proceeds, sir.</P>

<P>Q: When, if you know, did you first become aware that Susan McDougal did receive a $300,000 loan from David Hale's  company, if you know?</P>

<P>A: I believe it was when it broke in the press, when there were reports in the press, whenever that was, when was it, '92, '93, whenever.</P>

<P>Q: Okay.</P>

<P>Q: But I didn't know anything about it before then.</P>

<P>Q: Mr. President, in 1986, were you aware that Jim and Susan McDougal were buying land in south Pulaski County from International Paper Realty Company for a project, real estate development project, later to be known as Lorance Heights? Were  you aware of that in 1986?</P>

<P>A: No, sir. The only thing I knew about was what I testified, I stopped in on 145th Street at Mr. McDougal's office, in a suit, it is too far to jog, and that's all I know. I don't know where they got that property, I didn't know if they had any other property, I don't know where they got that.</P>

<P>Q: All right, sir. And were you aware in 1986, for a few months' period of time during that year, that Lorance Heights property was held in the name of Whitewater Development Company? Were you  aware of that in 1986?</P>

<P>A: No, sir. In 1986, I did not know that.</P>

<P>Q: Were you aware, also, in 1986 that later in that year the Lorance Heights land was transferred out of Whitewater  Development Company into another McDougal company? Were you aware of  that, its going on?</P>

<P>A: No, sir. Since I didn't know it was ever in there in the first place, when it left, I was not aware of that, either.</P>

<P>Q: All right, sir. And did you know in 1986 how the McDougals financed the purchase of the land later known as Lorance Heights?</P>

<P>A: No, sir, I did not.</P>

<P>Q: Did you know in 1986 where the McDougals got the funds for the down payment for this land from International Paper?</P>

<P>A: No.</P>

<P>Q: Were you aware that in the late 1980s there was litigation involving the McDougals and International Paper Company  whereby International Paper eventually took back this land?</P>

<P>A: No, sir.</P>

<P>Q: When did you -</P>

<P>A: I don't remember knowing about that, either, in the 1980s. I don't believe I knew anything about that.</P>

<P>Q: When did you first find out, if you know, that Whitewater Development Company briefly held title to this land known as Lorance Heights?</P>

<P>A: When that information appeared in the press, whenever that was. It was either in late - in '92 or '93, sometime in that time frame, that information appeared in public, and that's how I  became aware of it.</P>

<P>MR. McDANIEL: Your Honor, as has previously occurred, and to  Mr. President a thank you. I have no further questions.</P>

<P>THE COURT: All right, Mr. Jahn, you might proceed with your cross examination.</P>

<P>EXAMINATION ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF BY MR.  JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: Mr. President, during the course of your direct examination, sir, you made a reference to different versions of David Hale's accounts. Can you tell us, sir, what is your source of information concerning different versions of David Hale's accounts?</P>

<P>A: Well, just from press accounts and from reports that my counsel have given me.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. Are you aware, sir, of what he testified to?</P>

<P>A: I believe he testified -</P>

<P>Q: I'm not asking you, sir, what he said. I'm saying, has anyone related to you a version of what his testimony was under oath?</P>

<P>A: I read the press accounts of it.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. You read how - to what extent, sir, were they quotations, were they direct quotations?</P>

<P>A: Well, I read - I don't remember, but I read the press accounts, and of course, my counsel has briefed me. They said that under oath he said that I was in jogging shorts in the cold weather on 145th Street.</P>

<P>Q: Okay.</P>

<P>A: And some other things.</P>

<P>Q: So, you did receive, then, direct information concerning what it was that Mr. Hale had apparently testified to under oath; is that correct?</P>

<P>Q: You indicated, sir, that your counsel provided you information concerning how Mr. Hale had testified. I believe you indicated there was something along the line of wearing jogging shorts while you were at the 145th Street. What other information did you receive, not from the newspapers, but what other information did you receive concerning the subject matter and the content of Mr. Hale's testimony?</P>

<P>A: None, sir. I mean, my impression is that all of us were talking about what we read in the paper.</P>

<P>Q: Were you aware, sir, or are you aware, sir, that the law firm that was formerly - Mr. Lindsey was formerly associated with was buying a transcript of the testimony provided in the court, sir?</P>

<P>A: No, sir, I was not aware of that.</P>

<P>Q: Is Mr. Lindsey still associated with the White House, sir?</P>

<P>A: He is.</P>

<P>Q: What is his current association with the White House?</P>

<P>A: Mr. Lindsey is one of my aides, he travels with me, and he does political work for me.</P>

<P>Q: Has he ever related to you, sir, accounts as to what Mr. Hale allegedly said under oath during the course of this trial?</P>

<P>A: I don't believe so.</P>

<P>Q: I believe the question, sir, was whether or not anyone other than your attorney had related subject matter concerning what Mr. Hale had allegedly testified during the course of his testimony?</P>

<P>A: No, sir. I believe that all of us, including my attorneys, I believe we were all discussing what we read in the paper about Mr. Hale's testimony.</P>

<P>Q: You, sir, in your position, receive extensive briefing and briefing books concerning virtually every item that occurs to you on your daily schedule; is that correct, sir?</P>

<P>A: Well, I get a national security briefing in the morning and I get a scheduling book for the rest of the day, yes, sir.</P>

<P>Q: Have you received a briefing book concerning your testimony, sir?</P>

<P>A: I have received a briefing book which contains what I have said before in my interrogatories, and our notes on the three times I have been interviewed already by the Special Counsel's Office.</P>

<P>Q: Did that briefing book contain any accounts concerning what Mr. Hale had allegedly said under oath during the course of this trial, sir?</P>

<P>A: No, sir, it didn't.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. You were asked by Mr. Heuer, sir, concerning whether or not you had ever gone to Mr. McDougal and sought financial aid from Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan concerning your  joint business ventures; do you remember that, sir?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir, I do.</P>

<P>Q: You and Ms. Clinton - well, perhaps maybe I'm misphrasing it. There was, in fact, an occasion in which you did go to a financial institution controlled by Mr. McDougal concerning financial assistance to the Whitewater Development, was there not, sir?</P>

<P>A: That's correct.</P>

<P>Q: All right. Can you tell the jury, sir, what arose, what was the circumstances by which - first of all, who was it that did it?</P>

<P>A: My memory is that when Mr. McDougal had the bank up in Madison County, in the mountains of north Arkansas, Madison County is a county that adjoins Marion County were the Whitewater property was, that I had borrowed some money there, either Hillary or I one borrowed some money there, but it was our - our family, Hillary and I borrowed the money to build a house on one of the lots, one of the Whitewater lots that Jim thought would make it easier for us to sell the lots, make it more attractive, make it more realistic. And he had called me and said he had put some money into the developing of the lots and I should build a house, and we agreed to that, and that's what we did. I think that's what the loan was for.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. And that was the Bank of Kingston; is that correct, sir?</P>

<P>A: I believe that's right.</P>

<P> Q: All right. Later became called Madison Bank and Trust, I believe. Were you familiar with the change in name at a later date?</P>

<P>A: I am now, I don't know that I knew when it happened.</P>

<P>Q: And were you aware at the time, sir, that that was a financial institution owned jointly by Mr. McDougal and Stephen Smith?</P>

<P>A: I knew that Steve had an interest in the bank, yes.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. I believe the question was something along the line of, kind of describe for the jury's benefit your knowledge of Stephen Smith and your relationship with Stephen Smith.</P>

<P>A: I met Mr. Smith I believe in 1972 when he was a young Arkansas state legislator from Madison County. And in 1974,  when I ran for Congress, Mr. Smith supported that effort, worked in my campaign. He later came to work for me and he worked in my first term as governor, in the governor's office. He left shortly before the election of 1980, and that's the last time he ever worked for me. I maintained a limited but occasional contact with Steve in the years after that.</P>

<P>Q: And while he worked for you in the governor's office was the same time that Mr. McDougal also worked with you in the  governor's office?</P>

<P>A: That's right, they worked there together.</P>

<P>Q: And was that also the same time that Mr. McDougal advanced  to you or sought you out concerning your investment in what later became Whitewater Development Corporation? Was that also  about the same time?</P>

<P>A: Mr. Jahn, I think that was before that. I believe that Mr. McDougal and Susan and Hillary and I invested in Whitewater in 1978, before I became governor.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. But in 1978, was Mr. Smith working for you as attorney general, sir?</P>

<P>A: He was working in the attorney general's office.</P>

<P>Q: Okay.</P>

<P>A: But Mr. McDougal wasn't.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. Thank you. I'm sorry. Again, if I ask a question that's not a hundred percent within the confines of your memory, please correct me on that particular regard.</P>

<P>A: All right, sir.</P>

<P>Q: So, there did come an occasion then where you were approached, or you and Mr. McDougal discussed obtaining some financing for the benefit of Whitewater Development Corporation, and Mr. McDougal made the arrangements, did he not, sir?</P>

<P>A: Well, I assume that we made them together, since we took out the loan and we took it out from that bank.</P>

<P>Q: Do you recall you and your wife going to the Bank of Kingston and executing notes and the like?</P>

<P>A: No, I think we signed the note without going up there.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. And so, at the time that you did it, you knew that it was Mr. McDougal's institution?</P>

<P>A: I did.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. And you knew that he and Mr. Smith were basically in control of that institution?</P>

<P>A: I did.</P>

<P>Q: Now, at the time that it was done, though, is it fair, and I don't want to put words in your mouth that aren't fair, sir, is it fair to say that you actually considered that to be a debt of Whitewater Development Corporation, even though you were personally, or perhaps your wife was personally responsible, didn't you really consider that to be part of the Whitewater Development Corporation Enterprise, itself?</P>

<P>A: Mr. Jahn, I think the fair way to characterize it was, I considered that loan in the same light that I considered the other loans that we had taken out to finance Whitewater. That is, I had hoped that the company would generate enough income from the sales of lots to repay those loans, but I was well aware that if it did not generate that income that I would be personally liable on them.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. And that hope, sir, was based upon representations that Mr. McDougal made to you; is that correct, sir?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir. He had been in the land development business for some years, and he had enjoyed quite a bit of success in that.</P>

<P>Q: And you and your wife had no experience in land development; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: No. I had had that one very limited experience where I had made an investment with him and it had returned a nice profit in a modest amount of time.</P>

<P>Q: But as far as putting in roads and developing tracts</P>

<P>A: No.</P>

<P>Q: - and developing marketing programs and the like, that was Mr. McDougal's expertise.</P>

<P>A: That's right. And that was the understanding, that we would put in half of the money but that he would manage it.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. And you deferred to Mr. McDougal's expertise in that particular area?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir, I did.</P>

<P>Q: Did Ms. McDougal have any expertise in that particular area?</P>

<P>A: Well, they worked together. I donit know exactly what she knew, but they did work together, she was very active in the business, and of course, she helped to promote it and market it. She did some of the marketing.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. So, when there came occasions in which you had questions for Mr. McDougal, and you couldn't contact Mr. McDougal, was Ms. McDougal his alter ego as far as the Whitewater Development Corporation itself was concerned?</P>

<P>A: I don't know if I would use that word, Mr. Jahn. There were times when I talked to him over the years, times when I talked to her. The truth is, we didn't - once the property became more or less self-financing, we didn't talk much for years about it.</P>

<P>Q: Now, you say "once the property became self-financing.'' Did there come an occasion, sir, in which you believed that the properties had, in fact, become what you called self-financing?</P>

<P>A: I believe it was in - I believe in 1981, Mr. McDougal informed me that he had sold enough lots and payments were being paid on enough lots so that at least the bank notes could be paid down. I believe that's right.</P>

<P>Q: How important was that to you and Ms. Clinton, sir? And at this particular time, with all due respect, like most states, or perhaps like most southern states, public officials aren't overpaid in the state of Arkansas, are they?</P>

<P>A: We were paid less than the other southern states.</P>

<P>Q: Okay.</P>

<P>A: But - well, in 1981, I was a lawyer and making a pretty good living. But when I was attorney general and governor, I didn't make much. But Hillary made more money than I did, and she did quite well and we were quite comfortable, but we didn't want to be - we didn't want to lose all the money we had borrowed, obviously, and I was pleased when the investment began to pay out.</P>

<P>Q: And the representation then from Mr. McDougal that he had these hopes and expectations and dreams that the properties would start to sell and then they would become self-supporting, that was an important feature of the decision to invest in the first place, wasn't it, sir?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir. But what happened to that property happened a lot of times - in a lot of places, the market changed rather dramatically in 1979 and '80 in our state, and in other places, as well. I didn't blame Mr. McDougal or anyone else. The market changed on us and we bore the consequences.</P>

<P>Q: But by 1981, I believe it was your testimony, though, Mr. McDougal still represented to you that despite the market change, there had been enough sales to make the property basically self-sufficient; isn't that correct?</P>

<P>A: That's correct.</P>

<P>MR. HEWER: May it please the Court.</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: Sir, do you recall whether or not there was a name affixed to that particular piece of property that we were talking about as far as the loan from the Bank of Kingston?</P>

<P>A: No, sir, I don't.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. Does lot 13 ring a bell with you, sir?</P>

<P>A: That - it sort of rings a bell, that could have been it, where the house was.</P>

<P>Q: And do you recall, sir, that there was subsequently a sale of that particular piece of property to a man by the name of Hillman Logan, do you remember that, sir?</P>

<P>A: I do remember that.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. And in connection with that particular sale, the property had been placed in either your wife's name or you and your wife's name, and it was necessary, then, for you to execute certain documents and papers in connection with that sale; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: That could be. I don't remember the documents, but I will it could have been the case.</P>

<P>(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibit Number 94 was marked for identification.)</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: All right. I want to show you, if you will, sir, what has been marked for</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: And Ms. Nance, I think we need some copies for defense counsel.</P>

<P>MS. NANCE: (Complies.)</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: What has been marked for identification first as Government's Exhibit 94. And I would ask you, if you would, to take a look at this, sir.</P>

<P>A: (Witness reviews document.)</P>

<P>(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibits numbered 94-A and 94-B  were marked for identification.)</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: Your Honor, if we could have a second, there apparently was some confusion when copies were provided to  counsel.</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: Have you had a chance, sir, to review the document that has been identified as Government's Exhibit 94?</P>

<P>A: I have, sir.</P>

<P>Q: Does it have a signature, sir, on there that purports to be your signature?</P>

<P>A: It does.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. Does it also have a signature on there that purports to be the signature of James McDougal?</P>

<P>A: It does.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. Let me ask you, Mr. President, is the signature on Government's Exhibit Number 94 -</P>

<P>A: Wait, wait. It does not have a signature.</P>

<P>Q: I'm sorry. It's a blank - is that one blank, then?</P>

<P>A: Well, I can't see. It looks like there is something down there, but I can't tell, it may be Jim's.</P>

<P>Q: Okay.</P>

<P>A: And I can't see. It says ''Officer/Purchaser,'' but I can't read it. The only signature that I see here - well, this could be James McDougal, the Bank of Kingston. It is very - it could be. I can't tell for sure because of the copying.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. Well, let's just go back, then, to your signature. You can't see your signature; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: It is partially blocked, but I can see some of it.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. And then, also there is a signature that purports to be the signature of your wife; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: That is correct.</P>

<P>Q: Sir, is that your signature?</P>

<P>A: I don't believe it is.</P>

<P>Q: All right. And as far as your wife's handwriting, sir, does that appear to be your wife's handwriting?</P>

<P>A: I don't believe it is.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. I'm going to show you next Government's Exhibit 94-B, as in boy, and I would ask you, sir, if you could, to review this document.</P>

<P>A: (Witness reviews document.) All right.</P>

<P>Q: Have you had a chance, sir, to review that document?</P>

<P>A: (Witness reviews document.)</P>

<P>Q: And we are going to go just to the signature, Mr. President.</P>

<P>A: All right.</P>

<P>Q: If that will help speed things up.</P>

<P>A: All right. Q: Okay. Once again, on the last page, sir, is there a signature that purports to be your signature on that particular document?</P>

<P>A: Yes.</P>

<P>Q: And is there a signature, sir, that purports to be your wife's signature on that document?</P>

<P>A: Yes, yes.</P>

<P>Q: And is there a signature that purports to be Mr. McDougal's on that document?</P>

<P>A: Yes, yes.</P>

<P>Q: And as far as the document itself is concerned, 94-B, sir, is the signature on that document yours?</P>

<P>A: I don't believe it is.</P>

<P>Q: All right. And as far as the handwriting that appears under the - for Ms. Clinton, sir, does it appear to be Ms. Clinton's handwriting?</P>

<P>A: I don't think so, no.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. Now, as far as the document itself or the property itself is concerned, these two documents are - can you tell us what the heading is, as far as the title of the document?</P>

<P>A: It says ~~``Escrow Contract.''</P>

<P>Q: Okay. And can you give us a date? Is there an approximate date on the contract, itself?</P>

<P>A: December 9th, 1981.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. And as far as the contracts to the property, itself, did it, in fact, cover the property that was the subject of the loan at the Bank of Kingston, or can you tell from the legal description, sir?</P>

<P>A: Well, it says, "Tract 13 of the Whitewater Estates," and it is being sold for $27,500. I believe that it was the subject. I'm not positive, but I believe it is.</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: Your Honor, we would move the introduction of Government's Exhibits 94 and 94-B.</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: Mr. President, you have identified those particular documents, and I believe they are now in evidence. If you would, sir, I'm going to show you next what has been marked for identification only as Government's Exhibit 94-A, and would ask you, sir, if you can, can you examine Government's Exhibit 94-A?</P>

<P>MR. COLLINS: You mean "B," I think.</P>

<P>THE WITNESS: Yes, I can. (Witness reviews document.)</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: If you would, sir, the signature that's on that particular - first of all, what type of document is it as far as its heading is concerned?</P>

<P>A: It says, "Warranty Deed."</P>

<P>Q: Okay. And can you give us an approximate date that appears at the bottom of the document where it is executed?</P>

<P>A: December 14th, 1981.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. And as far as the signature that appears on that, sir, does that appear to be your true signature?</P>

<P>A: Yes, it does.</P>

<P>Q: All right. And as far as the handwriting that appears on that particular document, sir, does that appear to be your wife's true handwriting?</P>

<P>A: It does.</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: Your Honor, we would move the introduction of Government's Exhibit 94-A.</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: Mr. President, as far as the document itself is concerned, it did, in fact, accurately reflect that you and your wife were transferring that particular piece of property to Mr. Logan; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: That's what the document says.</P>

<P>Q: All right.</P>

<P>A: It's a Warranty Deed.</P>

<P>Q: And can you explain, though, how your signature appears on the escrow, the two versions of the escrow contract that was presented to you as Government's Exhibits 94 and 94-B?</P>

<P>A: I believe that - no, I can't explain that, that's the first time I have seen it.</P>

<P>Q: All right. Have you looked - well, I believe you have been shown to it - you were shown during the course of your interrogatories, I think you were questioned about it during that time, during the course of your interrogatories, you also expressed at that time the sentiment that it was not your signature. And so, I'm asking now, if you would - that was just, what, 1994, 1995.  Can you explain - do you have any recollection as to how your  signature could have appeared on this particular document?</P>

<P>A: I have no recollections about it.</P>

<P>Q: Okay.</P>

<P>A: I just - I remember that we sold the house to Mr. Logan.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. Who was it that you looked to as far as the management of the sale? Did you, in fact, negotiate with Mr. Logan?</P>

<P>A: No, I never met him.</P>

<P>Q: Did your wife even negotiate with Mr. Logan?</P>

<P>A: No.</P>

<P>Q: Who did you and your wife look to, sir, as far as negotiations and the management of the sale of properties located at Whitewater Development Corporation?</P>

<P>A: Mr. McDougall</P>

<P>Q: All right. So, as far as the particular document, then, that bears a signature that purports to be your signature, do you have an opinion, sir, as to who might have signed that particular document?</P>

<P>A: I don't know that.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. Have you ever - was it ever brought to your attention at that particular time that anyone was going to seek your permission to affix your signature to a document, a legal document?</P>

<P>A: I just don't remember.</P>

<P>Q: All right. Well, did you ever give Mr. McDougal either expressed or implied permission to affix your signature to any documents bearing - or relating to Whitewater Development Corporation business?</P>

<P>A: I don't remember having such a discussion, but Mr. McDougal was clearly managing the property and doing what he thought that he could to move the property.</P>

<P>Q: Okay.</P>

<P>A: But I don't remember any specific discussion of that, sir.</P>

<P>Q: And you entrusted Mr. McDougal, or you trusted Mr. McDougal to do what was necessary for the benefit of the joint venture between yourself and your wife; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: I did trust him, yes, sir.</P>

<P>Q: All right. And were there occasions, for instance, where Mr. McDougal would send you documents to sign, such as loan renewals and extensions, that you would sign and return to him?</P>

<P>A: Well, I signed some renewals and extensions over time, perhaps he sent them to me. I don't remember specifically.</P>

<P>Q: Well, did you ever initiate or undertake an active role in obtaining the financing for Whitewater Development Corporation, itself?</P>

<P>A: No, sir, I did not.</P>

<P>Q: All right. As far as the initial loans that Whitewater, can you explain to the jury basically how Whitewater Development Corporation was initially financed?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir. When we bought the 230 acres of land, we - the price was $200,000, and we paid $20,000 down, which we  financed with a loan, I think from Union Bank of Little Rock, but anyway, from another bank, and then we borrowed the $180,000 amount from the local bank in Marion County, the bank in Flippin, it has had several different names over the last 15 years, I think it has had three different names, but anyway, it is the only bank in town.</P>

<P>Q. Okay</P>

<P>A. We borrowed the money from that bank, the principal amount. And it was - and our hope, I will say again, was that we could sell enough lots so that the income from the lots would at least be sufficient to pay off the bank notes when they came due, and then hopefully, some day, we would actually make a  profit.</P>

<P>Q: Okay.</P>

<P>A: It was a vain hope, as it turned out.</P>

<P>Q: As far as the land itself, let's take it one step at a time, you talked about the purchase of the land. Did you and Ms. Clinton ever even go and look at the land before it was acquired, sir?</P>

<P>A: No, sir. We saw some pictures of it, and I was very, very familiar with that county, with the White River, that's where I had run for Congress, I had lived in northwest Arkansas for three years before I moved to Little Rock, and so I was - when Jim described it to me, and I saw a couple of pictures, I knew where it was and what it was.</P>

<P>Q: Okay.</P>

<P>A: And I made the judgment it was a good business risk.</P>

<P>Q: Sure. So, you, again - he showed you photographs, he described it to you, he told you what his hopes were for the property, he told you what his expectations were for the property; is that correct, sir?</P>

<P>A: That's correct.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. And did he tell you what his dreams and visions were for the property, for the area?</P>

<P>A: Well, I was familiar with the work that he was doing, and with the fact that he had done quite well in the 1970s, as land values had escalated and retirees had flooded into our state, and it seemed like a good risk to me, because I was familiar with the experience of the last several years.</P>

<P>Q: Is the answer yes, sir? Did he tell you what his dreams or visions were for this particular property?</P>

<P>A: Well, he told me what he hoped - he told me what he hoped would happen to the business ventures.</P>

<P>Q: Okay.</P>

<P>A: And I thought it was a good risk, and so I joined him.</P>

<P>Q: And you placed your trust, and your wife placed your trust in Mr. McDougal's abilities and his integrity; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: Yes. But we also had an independent judgment about what the market would probably do. Turned out our judgment was  wrong.</P>

<P>Q: Now, you had a situation involving Mr. Logan's property. You indicated you got some financing at Union National Bank. Do you know who the loan officer was at Union National Bank that made that loan?</P>

<P>A: I don't remember that, sir.</P>

<P>Q: Did you ever know or meet a Harry Don Denton that worked at Union National Bank?</P>

<P>A: I know who Don Denton was. I'm not sure I met him at that time or whether he was the loan officer on the note.</P>

<P>Q: Did you have anything to do with acquiring the initial financing from Union National Bank?</P>

<P>A: I'm not sure. I might have, because I had some friends who worked there and I knew the people who owned the bank, but I'm not sure.</P>

<P>Q: As far as the major financing from the only bank in Flippin, and I'm with you, I can't keep the names straight, so let's just refer to them, to the bank in Flippin, as far as the major financing, did you have anything to do with that major financing?</P>

<P>A: Well, I knew the people at the bank, and I was aware that they were willing to finance it, but I believe Mr. McDougal made the contact.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. So, again, you were deferring to Mr. McDougal's expertise and Mr. McDougal's leadership</P>

<P>A: That's right.</P>

<P>Q: - in terms of establishing this particular transaction?</P>

<P>A: That's correct.</P>

<P>Q: Now, let's just jump ahead. You indicated in 1981 there was a representation made to you by Mr. McDougal that the bank, in and of itself - I mean, the land, in and of itself, was now generating enough income to become self-sufficient. Do you remember that, sir?</P>

<P>A: I believe, to be specific, Mr. Jahn, I believe that the representation was that enough lots had been sold so that the cash flow on the lots would at least cover the bank notes when they came up.</P>

<P>Q: Okay.</P>

<P>A: And I think that that's - by then, I had already invested some money, I didn't think I would ever get it back because of the changes in the economy, and I was simply relieved to know that the bank note would be able to be paid as it came up. And so, I remember being very relieved about it.</P>

<P>Q: Did there come a time, sir, where you were called upon, though, to execute another note, a note that was what has been referred to as the interest refinancing note? Did there come an occasion in which you were required or requested to execute another note to pay for interest payments that had not been made on the initial purchase loan?</P>

<P>A: Can you refresh my memory, do you have some specific evidence here?</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: Do we have the document, itself?</P>

<P>MS. NANCE: (Complies.)</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: Counsel, do you want to look at it first? I'm just going to show it to him for memory recollection.</P>

<P>(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibit Number 91 was marked for identification.)</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: If you would, Mr. President, I'm going to show you only for the purpose of refreshing your recollection, Government's Exhibit 91.</P>

<P>A: (Witness reviews document.)</P>

<P>Q: Mr. President, have you had a chance, sir, to look at the document?</P>

<P>A: Yes, I have.</P>

<P>Q: Does it refresh your recollection, sir, concerning the date in which a loan was made to refinance the interest on the bank in Flippin's note?</P>

<P>A: No, it does not.</P>

<P>Q: Let me ask you this final question, sir. Is that your signature at the bottom of the document, sir?</P>

<P>A: Mr. Jahn, as has been pointed out, it is a little smudged, and I can't be sure. It might - it might or might not be, and it might well be my wife's signature there, I just can't tell. I think I ought to point out for the benefit of the Court and the jury that this - that this date is November 1st, 1982, that was just a couple of days before the general election for governor, and that it would be the last thing on my mind to be involved in this. I do not have any recollection of it. But I cannot say for sure that the signatures at the bottom are not mine or Hillary's. I'm confident the others weren't, I'm not so confident on these. It might be mine and it certainly might be hers, I'm just not sure.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. Mr. President, if we could, sir, let's move on to the time frame of 1985 and 1986. And at that particular time, I believe you testified that Mr. McDougal had, in fact, moved back into town and had opened a savings and loan within Little Rock; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: That's correct, sir.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. Do you recall at this time, sir, the financial obligations which you and Ms. Clinton had toward the Whitewater Development Corporation's investments and its obligations financial institution - obligations at other financial institutions?</P>

<P>A: Well, the bank note in Flippin was still outstanding at some level, I don't know that I knew what level, and we may or may not have paid off the loan for - that we took out to pay for the house. I don't remember whether it had been paid off by then or not. It was</P>

<P>(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibits Numbered 87 and 89  were marked for identification.)</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: Okay. If you would, sir, I'm going to show you what has been first marked for identification as Government's Exhibit 89, and then I'm also going to show you Government's Exhibit 87.</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: Ms. Nance, if you could provide those.</P>

<P>MS. NANCE: (Complies.)</P>

<P>THE WITNESS: (Witness reviews document.)</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: Counsel, are we ready?</P>

<P>MR. McDANIEL: Yes.</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: Government's Exhibit 87, sir, I would like to ask you, do you have that before you?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir, I do.</P>

<P>Q: The signature which appears on the bottom of Government's Exhibit 87, can you identify that, sir, as being your signature?</P>

<P>A: Yes, it is mine.</P>

<P>Q: All right. And can - well, can you tell us as far as the type of document, what is the document itself, sir?</P>

<P>A: This appears to be a loan extension agreement with the Security Bank of Paragould with the amount extended, $13,800.</P>

<P>Q: Did there come an occasion, sir, in which the bank loan that we discussed previously, the Bank of Kingston, later Madison Bank and Trust, did there come an occasion, sir, when that loan was moved out of that financial institution to another financial institution?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir.</P>

<P>Q: Okay.</P>

<P>A: It did.</P>

<P>Q: And at the time that that was moved, did you execute a note, then, at the other institution?</P>

<P>A: I believe I did.</P>

<P>Q: All right. And that was the Security Bank of Paragould; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: That's correct, yes, sir.</P>

<P>Q: Now, did you make the arrangements as far as that particular note is concerned as far as negotiating for that particular loan?</P>

<P>A: Mr. Jahn, I honestly don't remember, it was a long time ago. I don't remember.</P>

<P>Q: All right. But as far as the loan itself was concerned, it was the loan you made in connection with the Whitewater  Development Corporation?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir, that's right.</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: Your Honor, we would move the introduction of Government's Exhibit 87.</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: And if you would, sir, Government's Exhibit 89, do you have that in front of you, as well?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir, I do.</P>

<P>Q: And we are back to the bank in Flippin; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: That's correct.</P>

<P>Q: Now, this particular document, does it have a date in the upper right-hand corner, sir, as far as the date that the document was executed?</P>

<P>A: Yes, it says, November 26th, 1984.''</P>

<P>Q: And does it have underneath a maturity date as far as how long this note was good for?</P>

<P>A: December 3rd, 1986.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. And as far as the document itself, the borrowers on the left-hand, upper left-hand portion, can you tell us who was the obligors under the document in the upper left-hand corner?</P>

<P>A: Whitewater Development, Inc., James B. McDougal, Susan H. McDougal, Bill Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton.</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: Your Honor, we would move the introduction of Government's Exhibit 89.</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: Mr. President, if you would, going back to Government's Exhibit 87, can you tell us what the amount was - at the renewal executed on September 30th, 1985, what was the amount of that renewal?</P>

<P>A: The amount extended was $13,800.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. And as far as Government ts Exhibit 89, as far as the renewal in November of 1986 due on December 3rd, 1986,  what was the loan amount in that particular instance?</P>

<P>A: $100,121.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. And these were both Whitewater Development Corporation obligations; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: Well</P>

<P>Q: I mean, from your state of mind, from your point of view, these were both Whitewater Development Corporation obligations; is that correct, sir?</P>

<P>A: They were Whitewater Development obligations if Whitewater Development had the money to pay them. Otherwise, they were  our obligations, personally. The four of us were jointly and individually obligated on the big bank note, and I was obligated on the small one.</P>

<P>Q: And it was your expectations and hopes and dreams and visions, though, that Whitewater Development Corporation would still be the entity that would be responsible for paying this note; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: I hoped eventually we could at least break even, that's right.</P>

<P>Q: All right. Now, in 1985 and 1986, sir, you still had - I believe you indicated Mr. McDougal had moved back into town.  Did you have fairly frequent contact with him during the year 1985, for instance?</P>

<P>A: I'm not sure. Itm sure I saw him a few times. I donit know how - I hate to use the word "frequent," because I don't know how many times. But I had some contact with him in 1985 over various things.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. You talked about your jogging, and if you can, I think it is on the record, but how far was Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan from the mansion at that particular time?</P>

<P>A: It was less than a mile from the Governor's mansion.</P>

<P>Q: All right. And there would be occasions, then, on which you would go out jogging on the streets of Little Rock; isn't that correct?</P>

<P>A: That's correct.</P>

<P>Q: And when you would go jogging on the streets of Little Rock, quite often, unlike today, sir, you had a lot more personal freedom, did you not, as far as being able to move without the necessary requirements of security?</P>

<P>A: Yes. And particularly if I was downtown in daylight, I would run sometimes on Main Street, that was one of the streets I regularly ran on.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. And you were free to run on your own and to go out and run and go by and visit people and talk to people and the like?</P>

<P>A: That's correct.</P>

<P>Q: And did you, in fact, on occasion jog past or jog to Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan?</P>

<P>A: On occasion, I did jog past it, yes.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. And on occasions, did you actually jog to it and go inside and stop and visit with people, sir?</P>

<P>A: I believe that once or twice I actually went in, yes.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. Now, during, again, the year 1985, were there occasions, sir, in which you, as governor of the State of Arkansas, would seek out advice from Mr. McDougal?</P>

<P>A: It's possible. Could you refresh my memory? Have you got a specific issue you want to raise?</P>

<P>Q: Yes, sir, I've got one. If you would, I want to</P>

<P>(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibit Number 73 was marked for identification.)</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: Could we have Government's Exhibit 73?</P>

<P>MS. NANCE: (Complies.)</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: May I approach the witness, Your Honor?</P>

<P>THE COURT: You may.</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: I want to show you what has been marked for identification purposes as Government's Exhibit 73.</P>

<P>A: (Witness reviews document.)</P>

<P>Q: Mr. President, I was showing you Government's Exhibit 73. And perhaps to speed things up a little bit, sir, I will try a little leading questions. That's a memo directed to you dated February 7th, 1985; is that correct, sir?</P>

<P>A: That's what it says, yes, sir.</P>

<P>Q: All right. And it is from Jim McDougal; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: Yes, it is all typed, there is no signatures on it, but it is typed, it says, ''To Governor Bill Clinton from Jim McDougall''</P>

<P>Q: Okay. And it is at the bottom left-hand side, sir, as far as the slug, I believe is what they call it, the initials, it says, JRM/SS on the bottom left-hand corner; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: That's correct, sir.</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: Your Honor, we would move the introduction of Covernment's Exhibit 73.</P>

<P>THE COURT: All right. Received.</P>

<P>(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibit Number 73 was received  into evidence.)</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: Mr. President, in Government's Exhibit 73, Mr. McDougal is writing to you concerning a request from someone in your office, i that correct, someone named Kathy?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir.</P>

<P>Q: And who is Kathy, sir?</P>

<P>A: I'm not sure, but it could be Kathy McNatt, it probably is someone who worked in the - in the appointments section of the governor's office.</P>

<P>Q: All right. And in it, it talks about recommendations for two people to fill the vacancies on the State Savings and Loan Board.</P>

<P>A: Yes.</P>

<P>Q: Can you tell the jury, sir, what is the State Savings and Loan Board?</P>

<P>A: The State Savings and Loan Board is a board - let me say, Arkansas has a lot of these boards, hundreds of them. The legislature at one point in history created a board to advise the person who is in charge of overseeing the state chartered savings and loan. The board, by statute, has to be comprised of people who, themselves, are in the savings and loan business, except there is a consumer position by law and there might or might not be a position for a senior citizen, I just don't remember. But otherwise, the vast majority of the board members have to come out of the state S&Ls, and I think at the time there were just a handful of them left in Arkansas.</P>

<P>Q: And were you aware, sir, that Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan was, in fact, a state chartered savings and loan?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir, I was.</P>

<P>Q: And if you would, sir, second paragraph, in the second paragraph, Mr. McDougal recommends John Latham, who was  Chairman of the Board of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan. Did you  know John Latham, sir?</P>

<P>A: I did.</P>

<P>Q: And did you, in fact, appoint Mr. Latham to the Savings and Loan Board based upon Mr. McDougal's recommendation?</P>

<P>A: Well, first of all, Mr. Jahn, let me say, I'm not sure I ever saw this memo, but we did appoint Mr. Latham, and Mr. McDougal, I believe, did recommend him, and I wouldn't be surprised if he wasn't the only person that wanted to be on the board. It was hard, we had to go scare up people to be on some of these boards by the mid-1980s. So I believe he was appointed.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. But you are saying you're not sure you ever saw the memo. If you saw the memo, though, would you follow Mr. McDougal's recommendation?</P>

<P>A: Well, I might have, might have done it if I hadn't seen it.</P>

<P>Q: Okay.</P>

<P>A: But in this case, I'm not sure that - as I've explained to you, this was a board with relatively little power, that had - the membership requirements included the requirement that people would be involved in the S&L business. We didn't have many state savings and loans left by then, and I wouldn't be surprised if Mr. Latham wasn't the only person that asked to be on this board.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. It had limited power, you indicated, but at the same time it did have some power, did it not, as far as branch regulations?</P>

<P>A: I expect it did.</P>

<P>Q: For instance, within the savings and loan institution?</P>

<P>A: Sure. I believe that's right.</P>

<P>Q: And were you familiar, sir, with a limitation that was placed upon savings and loans, or state chartered savings and loans concerning their investment in private businesses or their investment in service corporations limiting their investment to three percent?</P>

<P>A: I don't believe I was.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. Do you know whether or not Mr. McDougal was aware of any such limitation?</P>

<P>A: I don't know.</P>

<P>Q: Do you know whether or not Mr. McDougal was having any difficulty within his institution concerning any such limitation?</P>

<P>A: I do not.</P>

<P>Q: You indicated you know John Latham. Did you know Greg Young at the Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan?</P>

<P>A: I don't remember him, no, sir.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. If you would, sir, can you, for the benefit of the jury, read the last paragraph on Government's Exhibit 73, the memo from Mr. McDougal to yourself.</P>

<P>A: It says, Bill, we are down to only about 15 state chartered savings and loan institutions, and I'm about the only one around who has any interest in this board.''</P>

<P>Q: Now, as far as a memo from Mr. McDougal where it contains a personal sentiment such as this, Bill,'' do you feel, sir, that if you probably would have received a memo such as that, your staff probably would have brought that to your attention?</P>

<P>A: I just don't know, sir. There is no check here. My mail was opened by other people. It is quite possible that I would send an appointment form, a recommendation, with just some note saying, Jim McDougal recommended him.'' I just don't know what happened. But I certainly can't tell from this memo that I ever saw it, because when I saw things, I nearly always checked where my name was.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. I asked you concerning the status of Whitewater Development Corporation, and as far as the trust and faith that you put in Mr. McDougall Did Whitewater Development  Corporation in 1985 have a checking account, to your knowledge?</P>

<P>A: I don't know one way or the other. I never wrote any checks from it or received any checks from it.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. That was the next question. Did you have any authority over any checking accounts that bore the name Whitewater Development Corporation''?</P>

<P>A: I had - we, I was a passive investor, Mr. McDougal was managing the property.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. Did he ever talk to you, sir, concerning the status of their particular investments or concerning the status of the checking account in the spring of 1985?</P>

<P>A: I don't recall any conversations with Mr. McDougal about Whitewater in 1985.</P>

<P>Q: Directing your attention to March 29, sir, 1985, were you aware that the Whitewater Development Corporation checking  account was overdrawn approximately $25,000?</P>

<P>A: If it, in fact, was overdrawn, I was unaware of that.</P>

<P>Q: Now, in - you indicated that in the spring of 1985, let's just go back, in the spring of 1985, did there come an occasion, sir, in which Mr. McDougal raised funds for your campaign?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir, there did.</P>

<P>Q: All right. Can you tell the jury, as far as - first of all, spring of 1985 was not a campaign year, was it, sir?</P>

<P>A: No.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. What type of debt was Mr. McDougal assisting you on?</P>

<P>A: I had been re-elected Governor in the fall of 1984, in a campaign that I was fortunate enough to win handily, I got over 60 percent of the vote, but I owed about a $100,000 when the race was over, and I was having to pay it off. And Mr. McDougal  volunteered to have a fund raiser to pay a portion of the debt off.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. Is it fair to say, sir, as far as a debt that is incurred and exists after a campaign, sometimes those are the hardest ones to get rid of?</P>

<P>A: Not if you are a Governor that won with over 60 percent of the vote, it is not hard.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. But as far as the assistance that Mr. McDougal gave to you, you appreciated it, did you not?</P>

<P>A: I sure did. I appreciate everybody that contributed to my campaign .</P>

<P>Q: You made a comment, in fact, during the course of your direct testimony that as a candidate, it is quite second nature to ask people for their assistance; isn't that correct?</P>

<P>A: It is.</P>

<P>Q: Either their vote, perhaps some volunteering on the campaign; is that correct, sir?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir.</P>

<P>Q: Perhaps putting a sign, even something as small as putting a sign up in their front yard can become something of importance to you; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: Very important, yes.</P>

<P>Q: Then, of course, money is also important; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: It is.</P>

<P>Q: And also actually physically working in the campaign, going door to door, knocking on the door and the like, that becomes very important?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir. It is.</P>

<P>Q: Is it fair to say, then, as a campaign, you are asking quite a lot of people then, "Can you help me out?"</P>

<P>A: That ts the only way you can prevail is thousands of people helping you.</P>

<P>Q: All right. And in fact, because as you indicated, as your success in all your years in Arkansas, you must have asked thousands and thousands and thousands of people for their help?</P>

<P>A: I certainly did.</P>

<P>Q: Now, as far as the campaign itself is concerned, you did, in fact, attend a campaign fund raiser, it was located at Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir.</P>

<P>Q: And it was on April 4th, 1985; is that correct, sir?</P>

<P>A: I don't remember the exact date, but it was in the spring of '85 sometime.</P>

<P>(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibit Number 83 was marked  for identification.)</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: Okay. Let me, if you can, for the purpose of refreshing your recollection only, I'm going to show you what has been marked for identification as Government's Exhibit 83, and I believe I can represent, sir, that this was your schedule for the day of April the 4th, I believe, 1985.</P>

<P>A: (Witness reviews document.)</P>

<P>Q: And to be specific, sir, does it refer, ''At 4:15 Jim McDougal's fund raiser for the Governor''?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir. This is a Thursday, April 4th, 1985, and it says one of the things I did on this day was to leave the office at 4:15 to go to a fund raiser which Jim McDougal hosted.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. And does that refresh your recollection, then, as far as the date of the fund raiser itself?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. And if</P>

<P>A: I mean, I don't - this appears to be one of my schedules, and so - I do know it was in the spring of '85, so it probably was on April 4th.</P>

<P>Q: All right. And if you would, sir, during the course of that fund raiser, did you receive contributions from - either directly or indirectly, from certain individuals that were at that fund raiser?</P>

<P>A: Well, there were people who were there who contributed. I don't believe I received them, I don't believe they handed me the checks, but there were people there who contributed.</P>

<P>Q: Mr. President, during the course of your direct examination, you were questioned concerning your relationship with Mr. Tucker back during the time in which you and he ran against each other. Do you remember that line of questioning, sir?</P>

<P>A: I do.</P>

<P>Q: And I believe you've indicated that your relationship was estranged to a certain extent during the course of that campaign, which was in 1982; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: That's correct, sir.</P>

<P>Q: Now, did it begin to improve, though, shortly thereafter?</P>

<P>A: Well, as I said, when we discussed this before, or when I testified to this before, it was strained, but Governor Tucker, as a private citizen, continued to support the Democratic Party in Arkansas, continued to support my policies, and from time to time gave me contributions, which I very much appreciated.</P>

<P>So, there was a distance between us throughout the 1980s that had not been there before when we were younger and when we were very close, but as time went on, and as I said before, it got better. You know, time tends to heal those kinds of wounds.</P>

<P>Q: By 1985 and 1986, sir, was there still a distance between yourself and Mr. Tucker, or had you, in fact, become closer together?</P>

<P>A: Well, he contributed to my campaigns in the '80s a couple at least twice that I know of, but I think it would be fair to say that we had not recovered the kind of close relationship we had when we were young men.</P>

<P>Q: Had you gotten to a point, sir, where Mr. Tucker would confide in you concerning his business relationships in 1985 and 1986?</P>

<P>A: No, sir, we had not.</P>

<P>Q: Were you aware, sir, that he was doing business with Mr. McDougal during that period of time?</P>

<P>A: No, sir, I was not.</P>

<P>Q: Were you aware, sir, that he was seeking and obtaining loans from Mr. Hale during that period of time?</P>

<P>A: No, sir, I was not.</P>

<P>Q: Did he talk to you concerning his financial status during the years 1985 and 1986?</P>

<P>A: No, he didn't.</P>

<P>Q: Did he ever share with you any hopes or dreams or expectations that he had concerning his business future during the year 1985 and 1986?</P>

<P>A: I don't believe we ever had a conversation like that.</P>

<P>Q: All right. Now, as far as getting back to 1985, if you would, sir, I want to show you what has already been admitted as Government's Exhibit</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: I'm sorry, has this one been admitted?</P>

<P>MS. NANCE: What number?</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: 533-B, I think.</P>

<P>MS. NANCE: No.</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: I won't show you that particular check, sir. Were you aware, did Mr. McDougal ever talk to you, sir, concerning a development called Flowerwood Farms in the spring of 1985?</P>

<P>A: I'm not aware that he did, sir. But perhaps you could help me, maybe you know something I don't know. But I have no recollection of that.</P>

<P>Q: In the spring of 1985, Mr. McDougal, the documents will show, borrowed $135,000 from a Stephens Security Bank in Arkansas, a man by the name of Richard Smith made the loan. Did Mr. McDougal ever discuss with you, sir, the need to make a loan during the spring of 1985? We are talking about spring of 1985.</P>

<P>A: No, sir.</P>

<P>Q: Were you aware, or did he ever tell you, sir, that some of the proceeds from that loan were utilized to make payments or deposited in the account of Whitewater Development Corporation?</P>

<P>A: No, he did not.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. Again, back to the spring of 1985, who were you trusting as far as the management of Whitewater Development Corporation?</P>

<P> A: As I have said repeatedly, Mr. Jahn, Mr. McDougal was managing the property and had since we first bought it.</P>

<P>(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibit Number 76 was marked for identification.)</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: I'm going to show you next, sir, what is marked as Government's Exhibit 76, being a Warranty Deed bearing a file stamp of the 10th day of June, 1985.</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: And Your Honor, we would move the introduction of Government's Exhibit 76 based upon the understanding we had concerning deeds that were filed in public - in court.</P>

<P>THE WITNESS: (Witness reviews document.)</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: May I assume it has been admitted, Your Honor, without objection?</P>

<P>THE COURT: Yes, received.</P>

<P>(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibit Number 76 was received into evidence.)</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: Mr. President, do you need more time to look at it, sir?</P>

<P>A: No, sir, I have looked at it.</P>

<P>Q: All right. Mr. President, this Warranty Deed reflects that on the 3Oth day of May, 1985, James B. McDougal, as President  of Whitewater Development, Incorporated, also with a signature of Susan H. McDougal, as Secretary of Whitewater Development, Incorporated, transferred certain lots, and specifically lots two, three, four, five, six, nine, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 23, 24, 29, 30, 35, 37, 43, and 44 to an organization called the Ozark Air Services, Incorporated. Do you know who or what Ozark Air Services, Incorporated was, sir?</P>

<P>A: I don't believe I did know that, no.</P>

<P>Q: Did you know, sir, that these were the remaining unsold lots of Whitewater Development Corporation, Incorporated?</P>

<P>A: I don't believe I knew that at the time, no.</P>

<P>Q: Did Mr. McDougal consult with you, sir, prior to his transfer of the unsold lots of Whitewater Development in May of 1985?</P>

<P>A: No, sir.</P>

<P>Q: Did he ever tell you or did he tell you at that time, sir, as to what his - what he was receiving in exchange for these particular lots?</P>

<P>A: I don't believe he did, no.</P>

<P>Q: Did he ever talk to you, sir, concerning the obligations which you still, and you and Ms. Clinton still had, concerning the payments of debts in the name of Whitewater Development Corporation after 1985?</P>

<P>A: I'm not sure I understood that question, Mr. Jahn. Would you ask it again, please?</P>

<P>Q: Well, if Whitewater doesn't have any more real estate left over, where is the profit going to come from, Mr. President?</P>

<P>A: Well, presumably, sir, the real estate contracts were accompanied by the obligation to pay certain funds into Whitewater, that was the money that was going to be used to pay the bank notes off.</P>

<P>Q: Yes, sir. That's what you were going to break even on, or that's what Mr. McDougal told you?</P>

<P>A: That's what we hoped we would. And there were a period of several years within the early '80s where, at least I assume, that we were breaking even, or we were making the bank notes, the bank payments we were supposed to be making.</P>

<P>Q: Okay. And in fact, the profit that you and Ms. Clinton hoped to make was going to come from the sale of these excess lots, wasn't that a fact, sir?</P>

<P>A: Well, by then, sir, I had pretty much given up on making a profit, I was just hoping we could break even and not lose anything else.</P>

<P>Q: Well, now, Government's Exhibit 76, sir, is dated May 30th, 1985, and you still had the obligations reflected in the government's exhibits concerning the renewal of the loan which you signed in the fall of 1985. Do you remember that, sir?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir.</P>

<P>Q: Did Mr. McDougal, when you renewed that loan in the fall of 1985, did he tell you, sir, that he had, in fact, sold or transferred all of the real estate assets of Whitewater Development Corporation to Ozark Air Services, Incorporated?</P>

<P>A: No, sir, he didn't.</P>

<P>Q: Sir, if you would, in October of 1985, Mr. Tucker purchased 35 acres, or 34 acres of property at that same location that you've discussed previously in your testimony, that is, at 145th Street and what later became known as the Castle Grande area. Were you aware of that, sir, in October of 1985?</P>

<P>A: No, sir, I was not.</P>

<P>Q: OK. You indicated that you had been to that area on one occasion, and your recollection was that it was in June of 1986. Do you remember that?</P>

<P>A: Yes, I do.</P>

<P>Q: OK. If you would, sir, your calendar also reflects that in October of 1985, more specifically, October 26th, 1985, you went to the Siemens-Allison plant for their 15th anniversary celebration. Do you remember, sir, going to the Siemens-Allison plant at that location where you described in October of 1985 to celebrate their 15th celebration - 15th anniversary?</P>

<P>A: I believe I did go there, yes, sir.</P>

<P>Q: All right. At the time that you went, sir, that was on a Saturday, do you recall whether or not you knew Mr. Tucker had, in fact, purchased some real estate in that particular area?</P>

<P>A: I did not know that.</P>

<P>Q: OK. Your telephone call, toll records, sir, reflect that on the following Monday, October 28th, 1985, you received a phone call from Mr. McDougall. Do you recall, sir, what it was that you spoke to Mr. McDougal about on October 28th, 1985?</P>

<P>A: I don't know that I did speak to him.</P>

<P>Q: Well, if you can, let me show you some - are you familiar with the record-keeping system by Ms. Dixon, sir?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir, I am.</P>

<P>Q: OK.</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: If I may have a second, Your Honor.</P>

<P>(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibit Number 71-B was marked for identification.)</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: I'm going to show what has been marked for identification as Government's Exhibit 71-B as in boy, reflecting a page of her records of October 28th, 1985. Do you see that before you, sir?</P>

<P>A: (Witness reviews document.) This appears to be just a series of notes that Linda Dixon made to herself, yes, sir.</P>

<P>Q: And reflects a Jim McDougal, 3 p.m., 374-7777; is that correct, sir?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir. But it doesn't reflect whether he called for me or for Betsey Wright.</P>

<P>Q: OK. That's a good point, sir. But as far as the notation or the scratching out of the document, do you know what Ms. Dixon's practice was as far as calls which were either completed or returned as far as scratching out those particular document?</P>

<P>A: No, sir, I don't.</P>

<P>Q: OK. And Ms. Dixon was - what was her position at the time, sir?</P>

<P>A: She was my secretary.</P>

<P>Q: All right. And is she still employed with you, sir?</P>

<P>A: Yes, she is.</P>

<P>Q: OK. And what is her position now, sir?</P>

<P>A: She works in our office in Arkansas.</P>

<P>Q: OK. And as far as - but back to the question, sir. Do you recall receiving a phone call in October - October 28th, 1985 from Mr. McDougal?</P>

<P>A: No, sir. I have gotten a few phone calls since then. That was more than 10 years ago. I don't remember it, no.</P>

<P>Q: Sir, the records of the governor's mansion of the state of Arkansas reflect that on December 19th, 1985, Mr. McDougal and Senator Fulbright came by the mansion and visited with you. Do you remember that event, sir?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir. I remember that Senator Fulbright was in town and he wanted to see me, I wanted to see him, and Jim was good enough to bring him by.</P>

<P>Q: OK. During the course of that visit, sir, did you and Mr. McDougal have any conversations concerning the development of his property called Castle Grande out at the 145th Street location that you've talked about?</P>

<P>A: No, sir. I believe it was just a social visit with Senator Fulbright.</P>

<P>Q: OK. In that case, then, do you recall any conversations you might have had concerning some property that he desired to purchase from International Paper Company, property that later became known as the Lorance Heights development?</P>

<P>A: No, sir, we never talked about that.</P>

<P>Q: Now, you testified on your direct, sir, that you recall an occasion in January of 1986 when Mr. McDougal came by the mansion and visited with you; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir, he did.</P>

<P>Q: And your recollection, sir, was that that was sparked by some difficulty that he was having with the state of Arkansas, with an agency within the state of Arkansas?</P>

<P>A: That's correct.</P>

<P>(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibit Number 81 was marked for identification.)</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: Sir, if you would, I'm going to show you what has been marked for identification as Government's Exhibit 81. Government's Exhibit 81, sir, is a memo addressed to you; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir.</P>

<P>Q: And it reflects the discussion concerning that meeting on that Saturday in 1986, January 1986; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: Well, this is a memo to me from Nancy Hernreich, who was at that time my scheduler, and it has got my check on it in a handwritten notation, it is in my handwriting. It says Mr. McDougal wants to see me before Tuesday.</P>

<P>Q: OK. And it has the notation of 1-14 as the date, and then a notation of 1-18, `1 slash 18, Saturday, mansion''; is that correct, sir?</P>

<P>A: That's correct.</P>

<P>Q: And the handwriting at the bottom this "Saturday morning," that is your handwriting?</P>

<P>A: "Saturday morning," that is my handwriting.</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: Your Honor, we move the introduction of  Government's Exhibit 81.</P>

<P>THE COURT: All right. Received.</P>

<P>(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibit Number 81 was received  into evidence.)</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: In that, sir, what is the stated purpose as far as Mr. McDougal's desire to see you on that Saturday, the 18th of 1986, sir?</P>

<P>A: Well, this says - I will just read it. May I read it?</P>

<P>Q: Yes, sir, please. It is in evidence.</P>

<P>A: This is a note from Nancy. It says, He needs to see you before Tuesday to get you to sign some personal business papers. The best time would be this weekend or next Monday, which is a state holiday. Any time is fine with Jim. Do you want me to have him come by?'' So, this is between 1-14 and the next Tuesday, and  I said, "Saturday morning."</P>

<P>Q: Yes, sir. What were the personal papers that Mr. McDougal wanted you to sign, sir?</P>

<P>A: I don't know. I don't remember. And I'm not sure there were  any.</P>

<P>Q: Well, Mr. McDougal at this time was a friend of yours; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: Yes.</P>

<P>Q: He was a political adviser to a certain extent; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: He gave me some political advice, yes.</P>

<P>Q: He was a business partner of yours; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: Yes.</P>

<P>Q: It wasn't necessary for him to fib to your staff in order to get to see you, was it, sir?</P>

<P>A: No.</P>

<P>Q: Do you recall, sir, whether or not you were asked to sign any personal papers on January 18th, 1986, by Mr. McDougal when he  came to the mansion?</P>

<P>A: I do not remember signing any papers like that.</P>

<P>Q: All right. And no one has ever shown you any personal papers that bear a date of January 18th, 1986, that you signed for - on behalf of Mr. McDougal, have you, sir?</P>

<P>A: I don't remember doing it, and I have seen no documents that indicate that I did.</P>

<P>Q: All right. And as far as that particular visit, do you recall one particular reason that he came. Do you recall him bringing any personal papers with him when he came, sir?</P>

<P>A: I don't, no.</P>

<P>Q: Did he discuss with you, sir, any negotiations that he had concerning the purchase of property from International Paper Corporation in January of 1986?</P>

<P>A: Absolutely not. He never talked to me about that.</P>

<P>Q: Did he discuss with you any hopes or expectations that he might have concerning his Castle Grande real estate development during that meeting in January of 1986?</P>

<P>A: I don't remember any such discussion.</P>

<P>Q: Did he discuss with you the prospect of, regardless of the names, of acquiring additional property south? You do know  where Castle Grande is, right? I mean, you are familiar now with - that that was the name that was applied to the 145th Street development area by Mr. McDougal? I just want to make sure we are on the  same wavelength.</P>

<P>A: I'm familiar with the fact that he had that property on 145th Street.</P>

<P>Q: Yes, sir. And are you familiar, then, that there was advertising concerning Castle Grande and that was the name that was applied  to that particular real estate?</P>

<P>A: If you say so, I'll take your word for it.</P>

<P>Q: Well, I.m just asking you. OK. So, lefts talk about the 145th Street - let's just call it the Castle Grande property, if we can. We have to make sure you and I understand what we are talking about. Did he talk to you concerning any hopes and expectations that he had as far as developments of the Castle Grande property?</P>

<P>A: The only property he spoke with me about was the property that he was having trouble with the Health Department on. Now, I  know that wasn't Whitewater property, I don't believe it was Castle Grande property, but it was some property where there was no municipal sewer system, and it had to be inspected by the state and approved for installation of septic tanks.</P>

<P>Q: Maybe I can help you -</P>

<P>A: And I don't know whether - now, maybe that was the Castle Grande property, but I don't know. I have no recollection of that. There was no discussion of property acquisition or finances or anything. He was upset because he thought the Health Department was not giving him a fair shake on this property. I have a very clear memory of that, and that's all I remember him talking to me about.</P>

<P>Q: Let's be more specific, then, and maybe I can help you. Do you remember Maple Creek Farms, do you remember that was the  property where he was having the difficulty with the Health Department,  was Maple Creek Farms?</P>

<P>A: I remember that he owned some property called Maple Creek,  but I don't remember - if that's where it was, I'll take your word for it. I'm sure there are documents on that.</P>

<P>Q: But then you have no independent recollection, then, of any conversation on January 18th concerning either developments of Castle Grande is that correct, sir?</P>

<P>A: That's correct.</P>

<P>Q: You have no independent recollection, did he discuss with you purchases of the Castle Sewer and Water by Jim Guy Tucker  during the course of that January 18th, 1986 meeting?</P>

<P>A: No, sir, I don't.</P>

<P>Q: OK.</P>

<P>A: Not at that meeting.</P>

<P>Q: And you have no recollection, then, concerning purchases of property from International Paper Corporation; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: Absolutely not. We never discussed anything having to do with International Paper Corporation.</P>

<P>Q: All right. Now, you, in exchange, or after having this meeting with Mr. McDougal, you personally, sir, set up a meeting, then, with representatives from the State Health Department, did you not, sir?</P>

<P>A: Well, that's - what I did was, I first had my staff look into it, give me a report, and then they arranged to have this meeting set up.</P>

<P>Q: Sir, back to the question. You personally, though, took a role in setting up that meeting; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: I don't believe I called the Director of the Department of Health to meet with him, but I - it's conceivable, but I don't believe I did.</P>

<P>Q: Do you know Tom Butler, sir?</P>

<P>A: I do know Tom Butler.</P>

<P>Q: Mr. President, you called Tom Butler and you specifically asked him, if he would, to come to the meeting, sir, and at that particular time, you told Mr. Butler that you were doing this because Mr. McDougal is a supporter.</P>

<P>Do you remember that, sir?</P>

<P>A: Have you got some documentation that would help me with  that? That was a long time ago.</P>

<P>Q: Sure. I'm going to show you a report of interview with Mr. Butler, if you would, sir, dated March 8th, 1995.</P>

<P>MR. COLLINS: May we have a copy of that?</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: That's the only copy I've got.</P>

<P>MR. COLLINS: Will we get one?</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: Sure.</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: And I highlighted the particular portions, sir.</P>

<P>MR. KENDALL: May the witness be allowed to read the entire document?</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: Sure. Whatever. I just highlighted to try to speed things up.</P>

<P>THE WITNESS: (Witness reviews document.)</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: Have you finished it, sir?</P>

<P>A: Almost.</P>

<P>Q: OK.</P>

<P>A: I have now read the whole thing.</P>

<P>Q: OK. You personally set up that meeting, or took a role in setting up that meeting with a conversation with Mr. Butler, did you not, sir?</P>

<P>A: Well, according to this interview. First, let's talk about this. You have given me an interview done by the Office of Independent Counsel with Tom Butler, who was the number two  person at the Department of Health when I was governor, and that was  done in - last month, on March the 9th, in 1995. And Mr. Butler says that I called him and asked him to give Mr. McDougal an interview about his septic tank problems, and I stated to him that he had been a supporter of mine for years and had never before asked for anything from the state. And that might well have happened.</P>

<P>Q: OK.</P>

<P>A: I don't dispute that. Let me just say this, I remember very well the meeting that was held in the governor's office about this.</P>

<P>Q: OK. So, you don't dispute, then, that you could have even because of your respect for Mr. McDougal and your relationship with Mr. McDougal, you could have even personally undertaken to set up that particular meeting; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir.</P>

<P>(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibit Number 93 was marked for identification.)</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: OK. And Mr. Butler, in fact, here - I want to show you now Government's Exhibit 93. Do you see Government's Exhibit 93, sir?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir.</P>

<P>Q: In order to speed things up, I'm going to do a little leading of you, if I could. That's your schedule for the date of March 4th, 1986; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir.</P>

<P>Q: And it reflects that you did, in fact, have such a meeting with Mr. McDougal and Mr. Butler at 2 o'clock on that day; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir.</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: Your Honor, we would move the introduction of Government's Exhibit 93.</P>

<P>THE COURT: All right. Received.</P>

<P>(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibit Number 93 as received into evidence.)</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: At that meeting, sir, did Mr. McDougal tell you that on that very day, or effective that very day, he had signed a contract to purchase 200 acres of land from International Paper Corporation, sir?</P>

<P>A: No, sir, he did not. He was - as this report that you have given me points out and refreshes my memory, that day all he could talk about, according to this report that you have given me, and it is certainly consistent with my memory, was how upset he was about the Health Department on the land there. He never said anything about any purchase of the land.</P>

<P>Q: Did he tell you, sir, that he had made that purchase - I'm sorry, 800 acres, I have been corrected - of 800 acres in the name of Whitewater Development Corporation?</P>

<P>A: Absolutely he didn't. As a matter of fact, we were never even alone there. I had a big meeting there because he wanted a hearing from the Health Department, and he didn't say anything about any of that. Not - he didn't ever say anything about it, and he certainly didn't say anything that day, absolutely not. This was a meeting about, just as Tom Butler reports here in this document you have given me, this was a meeting about the problems he was having getting septic tanks approved.</P>

<P>Q: Had you, sir, by March the 4th, 1986, been informed by Mr. McDougal of his sale of other assets of Whitewater Development; that is, that at that day, on that date, Whitewater Development had no other real estate assets for sale? Had he ever told you about that transaction we talked about earlier, the one back in June of 1985?</P>

<P>A: First of all, Mr. Jahn, those are two different things. The answer to the second question is, no, I don't believe he ever told me about it. I don't believe I ever knew that. The answer to the first question, I don't think is quite accurate. If the lots were sold on escrow contracts, then the deed was withheld and they had to make the payments to Whitewater and then Whitewater would use the payments to pay off the bank notes. So, I don't think - the fact that the land was sold, it was a good thing for Whitewater, not a bad thing, sir.</P>

<P>Q: But those were the loans that you were hoping would break you even. As far as making any profit, there were no assets in March of 1986 to make your profit, were there, sir?</P>

<P>A: Well, I don't know the answer to that. That depends on - I don't know how much was outstanding on all those lots that had been sold. I don't know if they had paid it all off if it would have been enough to pay the bank notes off and more besides. I don't have a clue about that. I can't answer that question.</P>

<P>Q: In March of 1986, sir, the only way Whitewater Development Corporation could make money, the money that Mr. McDougal promised you, the profit, was to acquire new assets and make a profit on those assets; isn't that a fact, sir?</P>

<P>A: Sir, I would have to say no for two reasons. Number one is no and I don't know. Number one, Mr. McDougal never promised  me any money. He asked me if I wanted to take a risk with him, a business venture, an investment. There is no such thing in the free enterprise system as a risk-free investment. We took a chance, we made what I thought was a prudent investment, and it didn't make money. I'm sorry about that, but he didn't violate any promise to me on that.</P>

<P>Number two, whether there was any way to make money or not depends upon a question that I don't know the answer to, which is, what was the total outstanding due on all the contracts that had been sold as of that time, and was that total sufficient to cover the bank note and leave something over besides? I don't know the answer to that, and I don't know that - if you do, I would be glad to hear it, but I don't have a clue whether that is true or not.</P>

<P>Q: And you don't know the answer because Mr. McDougal didn't tell you, he didn't sit down and talk to you concerning whether or not there was enough money or enough assets left to make a profit for Whitewater Development Corporation; is that your testimony, sir?</P>

<P>A: I was a passive investor, he was managing the land, that is my testimony.</P>

<P>Q: Exactly. He was managing the land, he was making the decisions; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: That is correct, he was making the decisions.</P>

<P>Q: And it is your testimony then that he never once told you about any great hopes or expectations or visions that he had for property that he was purchasing from International Paper Corporation?</P>

<P>A: Never once, he never discussed International Paper.</P>

<P>Q: Did he ever mention the name "Lorance Heights" to you, sir?</P>

<P>A: I don't believe so. I have no recollection of that.</P>

<P>Q: Did he ever mention the name "Master Marketing'' to you, sir?</P>

<P>A: No, sir.</P>

<P>Q: Did he ever ask you to make any more additional contributions to Whitewater Development Corporation in the spring of 1986?</P>

<P>A: I don't believe he  did.</P>

<P>Q: Did Mr. McDougal make any statements to you concerning the development of roads on the Lorance Heights property, sir?</P>

<P>A: No.</P>

<P>Q: Did Ms. McDougal make any statements to you concerning the development of roads on the Lorance Heights property?</P>

<P>A: No.</P>

<P>Q: Do you know R.D. Randolph?</P>

<P>A: I do.</P>

<P>Q: OK. Did he ever talk to you about hiring R.D. Randolph to do work out at the Lorance Heights property, sir?</P>

<P>A: I knew that R.D. Randolph worked with Jim McDougall I don't believe I knew what he did.</P>

<P>Q: I asked you about organizations that you had not heard about. Did you ever hear any reference to a company called Master Marketing, sir?</P>

<P>A: No.</P>

<P>Q: Did you ever discuss a Master Marketing with Jim McDougal?</P>

<P>A: No.</P>

<P>Q: Did you ever discuss Master Marketing with Susan McDougal?</P>

<P>A: No.</P>

<P>Q: On April the 3rd, 1986, Master Marketing received $300,000 from David Hale's corporation, Capital Management Services. Were you told in advance, sir, that such a loan was going to be made?</P>

<P>A: No.</P>

<P>Q: Were you told after such a loan was made that it had been made?</P>

<P>A: No.</P>

<P>Q: Were you told as to how the proceeds of that loan were used?</P>

<P>A: No, sir.</P>

<P>Q: were you aware, sir, that $25,000 of the proceeds of that loan was used for the down payment in the name of Whitewater Development Corporation of the International Paper Company property?</P>

<P>A: I was not aware of that.</P>

<P>Q: Were you aware, sir, of the need as to when the closing date was to be, as far as the purchase of that particular property?</P>

<P>A: No, sir, I wasn't.</P>

<P>Q: Did you have contact at all, during the year 1986, with either Mr. or Ms. McDougal concerning Whitewater Development Corporation, to your recollection, sir?</P>

<P>A: Yes, I believe I did, along toward the end of the year.</P>

<P>Q: All right. What happened along toward the end of the year, sir, in reference to the Whitewater Development Corporation and Mr. and Ms. McDougal?</P>

<P>Who was it, first of all, that contacted you?</P>

<P>A: I believe it was Mr. McDougal, along toward the end of the year.</P>

<P>Q: OK. And he contacted you, did he not, sir, and he wanted you and Ms. Clinton to basically abandon any interest in the property; is that correct - in the corporation; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: My recollection is he called me and he said to me, ''This thing has lost money. We've put a lot of money into it. It's never going to run a profit. I'd like for you to sign your stock over to me and we could use it for,'' I think, for "tax purposes" or something. I believe that's the request he made.</P>

<P>Q: And what was your response, sir?</P>

<P>A: Well, I discussed it with Hillary, and in the end we decided not to do it.</P>

<P>Q: OK. When he made that request of you, sir, did he tell you that there was, in fact, 800 acres of land in the name of Whitewater Development Corporation?</P>

<P>A: What 800 acres? You mean, different from the Whitewater land?</P>

<P>Q: Yes, sir.</P>

<P>A: I don't believe he did, no, sir.</P>

<P>Q: Did he tell you about any great hopes or expectations - at that time when he asked you to abandon your interest in Whitewater Development Corporation, did he tell you about any great hopes or expectations he had for the development of that property?</P>

<P>A: Mr. Jahn, my recollection is - and I believe he also wrote me a letter about this time - my recollection is that I had a conversation with him and I had a letter. And my recollection is that what he said was there were - Whitewater had lost money, it still lost money, there were losses on Whitewater that he had sustained, that if he had all the - if he were the sole stockholder, if he and Susan owned all the stock, that he could get some tax advantages from those losses, which means by definition he had some gains somewhere. But I had no idea what those gains were or what the tax considerations were. He didn't discuss it with me, and I didn't ask him.</P>

<P>Q: So, he didn't tell you anything at all about the assets that were then in existence of Whitewater Development Corporation?</P>

<P>A: He did not.</P>

<P>Q: He didn't tell you about any of his plans for development of the property in the name of Whitewater Development Corporation?</P>

<P>A: No, sir, he didn't.</P>

<P>Q: Didn't tell you anything at all about his plans for the future for Lorance Heights; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: That's correct.</P>

<P>Q: OK. Did he tell you, sir, that he was going to transfer assets from the name of Whitewater Development Corporation to Great Southern Land Company?</P>

<P>A: No, sir, he didn't.</P>

<P>Q: Are you familiar with the name "Great Southern Land Company," sir?</P>

<P>A: I am now.</P>

<P>Q: OK. Did you have any interest in the Great Southern Land Company in 1986?</P>

<P>A: No, sir, I didn't.</P>

<P>Q: What did you know Great Southern Land Company to be in 1986, sir?</P>

<P>A: I don't think I knew anything about it in 1986.</P>

<P>Q: OK. If you would, sir -</P>

<P>A: I might have, I just don't remember.</P>

<P>Q: All right.</P>

<P>(WHEREUPON, Government's Exhibit Number 80 was marked for identification.)</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: If you would, sir, I'm going to show you Government's Exhibit 80, that's a check from Ms. Clinton to Great Southern Land Company.</P>

<P>MR. McDANIEL: Give us just a moment, counsel.</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: Surely.</P>

<P>THE WITNESS: (Witness reviews document.)</P>

<P>I have reviewed the document, sir.</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: OK.</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: To Great Southern Land Company in December of 1978; is that correct, sir?</P>

<P>A: Yes, that's a check that my wife signed.</P>

<P>Q: OK. Do you know what Great Southern Land Company was,  sir?</P>

<P>A: I'm assuming it is a company that Jim owned, but I don't -</P>

<P>Q: I'm sorry. Isn't it, in fact, a company that he was using back in 1978 at one time or another?</P>

<P>A: That's entirely possible and I've just forgotten it, that's right.</P>

<P>Q: And did he ever tell you, sir, that he intended to transfer real estate assets from Whitewater Development Corporation to his other company, Great Southern Land Company?</P>

<P>A: I don't believe so. I certainly have no memory of it.</P>

<P>Q: You indicated, sir, that you - or specifically denied having certain conversations with David Hale during the course of your testimony?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir.</P>

<P>Q: Do you remember that line of questioning? How long have you known David Hale?</P>

<P>A: I believe I first met him, as I said, 20 years ago, perhaps a little more than 20 years ago, now.</P>

<P>Q: OK. And you're not representing that you can remember each and every conversation that you had with Mr. Hale; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: No. I don't believe I've ever had any kind of a substantive conversation with him. I don't believe we've ever sat down and had a long talk about anything.</P>

<P>Q: Well, but have you ever sat down and had fairly short talks with him?</P>

<P>A: Not to my memory. But I mean, we have been in the same  place, you know, on a few occasions over 20 years, so I can't remember every time I have ever seen him.</P>

<P>Q: Wasn't it a fact that at one point he was the judge that handled any crimes that arose within the capital complex? Did you ever have any occasion to see him, for instance, when he was lobbying for pay raises for state judges and things like that?</P>

<P>A: Well, if he was in the Capitol building, I might well have seen him. I was around the Capitol building, particularly during legislative sessions, I would sometimes visit committee hearings, and I saw hundreds, perhaps even a few thousand people during  every legislative session.</P>

<P>Q: And you're not maintaining, though, that you can remember each and every conversation that you had with Mr. Hale?</P>

<P>A: Not at all. I wouldn't begin to say that.</P>

<P>Q: And you're not maintaining, sir, that you can recall whether - what Mr. Hale's reactions were to any conversations that he may or may not have had with you, are you, sir? You're not trying to say that you are clairvoyant or anything like that, are you?</P>

<P>A: What are you asking me, sir?</P>

<P>Q: Well, I'm just asking you, there is no way that you can get in and read Mr. Hale's mind, is there?</P>

<P>A: No. I certainly can't do that. I wouldn't presume to do that.</P>

<P>Q: You are not claiming that you can know the thoughts that went on within Mr. Hale's mind at the time that he may or may not have had conversations with you; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: First of all, sir, I'm not sure I ever had a conversation with him in the Capitol, so I can't even speculate about something I'm not even sure occurred.</P>

<P>Q: Well, I didn't say in the Capitol, I'm just saying any conversations. You must have had some conversation. Are you denying any conversations that you ever had with Mr. Hale at this time?</P>

<P>A: Absolutely not. If - I knew who he was, so if I were to run into him, I'd say Hello, how are you,'' but I don't recall any substantive conversation I ever had with him.</P>

<P>Q: All right. And it is your testimony that you don't recall putting any pressure on Mr. Hale; is that what you said, sir?</P>

<P>A: My testimony is that I did not put any pressure on Mr. Hale.</P>

<P>Q: Yes, sir.</P>

<P>A: That's my testimony.</P>

<P>Q: And you are adamant about that, aren't you, sir?</P>

<P>A: I am adamant about that.</P>

<P>Q: So that even if there were conversations which you can recall - or which you cannot recall which occurred between yourself and Mr. Hale, you know that it was not your nature to go about trying to place pressure on individuals with whom you had associations; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: I did not have any personal business conversations with Mr. Hale.</P>

<P>Q: Well, but I'm saying, as far as your adamancy as far as pressure is concerned, what is that based upon, sir?</P>

<P>A: Based upon the fact that it didn't happen, sir.</P>

<P>Q: Well, is it based upon your recollection of all of your conversations with Mr. Hale?</P>

<P>A: It's based on the fact that I know that I never pressured David Hale to make a loan, just like I never ran in my jogging shorts out to 145th Street to see him in the cold. I know that I never did that. What he - it is not true that that happened, sir. It did not happen.</P>

<P>Q: Did you ever jog directly to Mr. McDougal's office space, sir?</P>

<P>A: I don't believe I ever jogged directly there, sir, but I - it was - as I testified earlier, Mr. McDougal's office in downtown Little Rock was on Main Street. I never jogged to any of his real estate offices, and certainly not to 145th Street, which was 12 miles or so, or 10 miles or something from  downtown Little Rock.</P>

<P>Q: I don't know why you would want to change the question, Mr. President.</P>

<P>MR. HEWER: Your Honor, again</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: The question is, did you ever jog to Mr. McDougal's office space?</P>

<P>MR. HEWER: I'm going to object to the argument by counsel.</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: Have you ruled, Your Honor?</P>

<P>THE COURT: Was that responsive to your question?</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: The answer that the president gave? I will be more than happy to clarify, if he doesn't understand, Your Honor. I will be more than happy to rephrase.</P>

<P>THE COURT: Rephrase it.</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: Where was the Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan office space, sir?</P>

<P>A: As I testified, sir, it was on Main Street, less than a mile from the governor's mansion.</P>

<P>Q: And you didn't even need to jog, you could stroll from the mansion to Mr. McDougal's office space, could you not, sir?</P>

<P>A: I could.</P>

<P>Q: And, in fact, during 1985 and 1986, there were a number of occasions in which you basically just got in your car and drove around to various areas; isn't that correct, sir?</P>

<P>A: I don't know that that's true.</P>

<P>Q: Well, as far as reports - was there a Lincoln assigned to the mansion, sir?</P>

<P>A: The governor had a Lincoln, yes.</P>

<P>Q: Yes, sir. I believe the line of questioning, Mr. President, was, it was not far from the mansion to Mr. McDougal's office, was it, sir?</P>

<P>A: No, sir. And I've already testified that I often jogged by there, and that on one or two occasions, I actually went in. I've already testified to that effect a few hours ago.</P>

<P>Q: So, there would be nothing, then, to prevent you from either jogging, walking, or driving from the mansion to Mr. McDougal's office, is there, sir?</P>

<P>A: I could go to Mr. McDougal's office whenever I wished.</P>

<P>Q: That's right. And then there would be nothing that would prevent you from getting in Mr. McDougal's car and driving anywhere where you wanted to, was there, sir?</P>

<P>A: That would be highly unusual.</P>

<P>Q: Well, I'm asking you, sir, was there anything that would prevent you from doing it?</P>

<P>A: I don't recall ever doing it.</P>

<P>Q: Well, but sir, but I'm asking you, if you would, sir, the question is, was there anything that would prevent you from doing it?</P>

<P>A: I wouldn't do that unless there was some reason to do it, and I know of no reason why I ever did it.</P>

<P>Q: Mr. President, if you would, sir, the question is, was there anything that would prevent you from doing it?</P>

<P>A: Yes, there is something that would prevent me from doing it. If I were - if I had jogged by there and I were unaccompanied by the state trooper and he was going to drive me some place besides drive me home so that there wouldn't be the state trooper behind us going wherever we were going, then I wouldn't get in the car, I don't think, and go anywhere with him.</P>

<P>Q: You just threw up a reason why you couldn't. But is there anything that, under normal circumstances, would prevent you  from either walking, jogging, or driving over to Mr. McDougal's place  of business, getting in his car, and driving any place you wanted to?</P>

<P>MR. McDANIEL: Objection, Your Honor, it has been asked and answered now three times.</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: Your Honor, I submit it has -</P>

<P>THE WITNESS: I must not understand the question.</P>

<P>BY MR. JAHN:</P>

<P>Q: OK.</P>

<P>A: If you want to ask me about a specific example and if something happened, I will be glad to answer that. I have told you that I frequently ran on Main Street. On a couple of occasions, I went in to Mr. McDougal's office at the savings and loan. I felt free to see him whenever I wished to. Now, I don't know how else  to answer your question. I have no recollection of riding anywhere in a car with him. If you think that there is a time when I did that or you want to ask me about it, sir, I will be glad to try to answer it, but I'm doing my best to tell you the truth, and all you're asking me to do is speculate.</P>

<P>Q: No, sir. All I'm asking you to do is to admit to the jury, sir, that there is no physical law, no spiritual law, no inconsistency that would prevent you from getting in Mr.  McDougal's car and driving anywhere that you wanted to back in 1985 and  1986. That's all I'm asking you.</P>

<P>A: Well, and I explained to you what the facts were, what my practice was. I explained to you what my practice was. Could I physically do it without anyone restraining me? Yes, I could have done that.</P>

<P>Q: OK.</P>

<P>A: Was it my practice to do it? The answer to that is no.</P>

<P>Q: So, the answer is, there was no reason why you couldn't have done it, as far as no physical prevention, no moral prevention, no logical prevention that would have prevented you from having  done it; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: There was a logical reason not to do it.</P>

<P>Q: All right.</P>

<P>A: Depending on where we were going. But nobody - I wasn't in handcuffs and chains, if that's what you are asking. No, I could have physically done it.</P>

<P>Q: Is there a reason that you didn't want to answer that question?</P>

<P>A: I didn't understand it.</P>

<P>Q: Oh, I'm sorry.</P>

<P>A: I still don't.</P>

<P>Q: If I don't make myself clear, please feel free to speak up. You've talked about jogging past Mr. McDougal's office. You're aware, sir, are you not, that Mr. McDougal has a recollection concerning an occasion in which you jogged past his office and  had a conversation concerning Ms. Clinton?</P>

<P>A: I am aware of that.</P>

<P>Q: Are you aware of that?</P>

<P>A: Yes, I am.</P>

<P>Q: And you are aware, sir, that Mr. McDougal has a recollection of an event in which you jogged by and asked Mr. McDougal to  place Ms. Clinton's law firm on a retainer. Do you remember that, sir? I'm saying, do you remember that that's one of Mr. McDougal's recollections?</P>

<P>A: I remember that - I am now aware that Mr. McDougal remembers that I asked - I believe he has testified that he thought I asked him to give Hillary some law business. I don't know about a retainer.</P>

<P>Q: And you're now aware that Mr. McDougal remembers that event occurring and you don't remember it; is that correct, sir?</P>

<P>A: I remember going in to see him. I do not remember asking him to do that, no.</P>

<P>Q: OK. But you don't recall asking him to place Ms. Clinton on a retainer; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: I do not, no.</P>

<P>Q: You don't recall - do you recall asking him to give her a specific amount per month in reference to that retainer?</P>

<P>A: No, I don't.</P>

<P>Q: Do you recall any - you say you remember going in to see him. Do you remember going in to see him and discussing Ms. Clinton and law business for Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan?</P>

<P>A: I do not.</P>

<P>Q: Is there any - I just want to make sure I'm asking you the right question, I'm not asking you a question that you don't understand. Is there any combination of facts that I can ask you that comes anywhere close to what Mr. McDougal recalls as far as that particular conversation is concerned?</P>

<P>A: Well, I don't remember the specific request. You know, we spoke in passing about a lot of things over the years. I don't know whether he asked me, How is Hillary doing?" ' How are we doing?" I'm just answering the question as I know it. I do not remember making that specific request.</P>

<P>Q: Do you remember the question, sir?</P>

<P>A: No.</P>

<P>Q: Will you at least concede, sir, that it is human nature that individuals remember events said differently from each other?</P>

<P>A: Depends on the significance of the events and how long ago they occurred. But obviously people's memory of specific things are different as time passes.</P>

<P>Q: OK.</P>

<P>A: Particularly if they are not especially important to them.</P>

<P>Q: OK. And if they are especially important, there are occasions in which individuals can remember, even on important issues, can remember conversations differently, one remembering it one way and one remembering it another. Isn't that a fair statement, sir?</P>

<P>A: Your definition of important'' and mine might be different. I think there are some times when people have different memories of exactly what was said, and both of them are doing their best to tell the truth.</P>

<P>Q: That's correct. And those events occur whether it is important or unimportant. You're the one that injected unimportant. I'm just trying to point out that those differences occur whether it is important or unimportant; isn't that correct?</P>

<P>A: Some things stick in your memory more than others, that's right, Mr. Jahn.</P>

<P>Q: That's correct. And sometimes it is a direct function of time. You can remember something which occurred yesterday but you can't remember something that occurred a year ago and vice versa; isn't that correct, sir?</P>

<P>A: Yes, sir.</P>

<P>Q: All right. And you're not saying that Mr. McDougal is necessarily wrong concerning his recollection of the event, are you, sir?</P>

<P>A: No. All I'm saying is what I remember. That's all I can do.</P>

<P>Q: OK. And as of now, sir, you cannot remember having a conversation with Mr. Hale concerning how Master Marketing was going to be funded; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: I can remember that I never had such a conversation.</P>

<P>Q: Well, you can remember specifically that you never had that conversation?</P>

<P>A: I never had that conversation.</P>

<P>Q: OK. Did you ever have any conversation with Mr. McDougal concerning how Whitewater Development Corporation was going  to be funded in 1986, sir?</P>

<P>A: No, sir.</P>

<P>Q: Did you ever have any conversation with Susan McDougal concerning how Master Marketing funds were going to be spent in 1986?</P>

<P>A: No, sir.</P>

<P>Q: And those conversations you also specifically recall; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: No.</P>

<P>Q: Or the lack of those conversations?</P>

<P>A: No, there were no such conversations.</P>

<P>Q: You indicated, sir, that you know R.D. Randolph?</P>

<P>A: I do.</P>

<P>Q: OK. How long have you known R.D. Randolph?</P>

<P>A: A long time. Maybe almost as long as Mr. McDougall I think that Mr. Randolph worked with Mr. McDougal in Senator  Fulbright's office in Little Rock back in the '60s. So, I've known him a long time.</P>

<P>Q: OK. And known him both personally as well as through politics; is that correct, sir?</P>

<P>A: Well, I know him personally, if that's - I mean, I know him by his first name, I've known him for many years.</P>

<P>Q: And he was also -</P>

<P>A: Knew his father, knew he was from Logan County, and they supported me up there. I knew him.</P>

<P>Q: And then you also knew that he was very active in politics; did you not, sir?</P>

<P>A: Yes, I do. Well, that's how I met him, through Senator Fulbright.</P>

<P>Q: OK. And you were - and in fact, you were active in obtaining his employment with the state, were you not, sir?</P>

<P>A: I believe that he got a job with the state at some time before I left the governor's office, and I think he asked me to support that. And we had someone in the governor's office that actually tried to help place people with state jobs, so I might well have done that.</P>

<P>Q: Mr. President, if you would, sir, during the spring of 1986, sir, did you know, or did Jim McDougal talk to you about  arranging a loan to benefit Larry Kuca and a firm called Campobello Realty?</P>

<P>A: No, sir.</P>

<P>Q: In the early part of 1986, did Mr. McDougal talk to you concerning arranging a loan for the benefit of Stephen Smith, your former employee, and his company, The Communication  Company?</P>

<P>A: No, sir.</P>

<P>Q: Did he talk to you, sir, concerning arranging a loan to benefit Jim Guy Tucker in a firm called Castle Sewer and Water?</P>

<P>A: No.</P>

<P>Q: Did you have any conversations, sir, I believe it's already been covered, but I'll ask it again, concerning arranging a loan to benefit a firm called Master Marketing?</P>

<P>A: No, sir.</P>

<P>Q: And lastly, sir, did you ever have any conversations with Mr. Tucker concerning arranging a loan with David Hale to benefit a firm called Southloop Construction Company?</P>

<P>A: No, I did not.</P>

<P>Q: Sir, you indicated that you had - or that you recall that you did not have any conversations in depth, or any substantive conversations with Mr. McDougal during the year 1986. Do you remember that, sir?</P>

<P>A: No, I remember saying that I didn't recall ever having any substantive conversations with David Hale.</P>

<P>Q: I'm sorry, David Hale. I'm sorry.</P>

<P>A: I testified that I did talk to Mr. McDougal in January of '86 for sure, and I stopped by to see him in June at his trailer on 145th Street.</P>

<P>Q: OK. But as far as conversations with Mr. Hale, that you testified affirmatively that you did not have those; is that correct?</P>

<P>A: I have no recollection of any kind of conversations with David Hale in 1986.</P>

<P>Q: Isn't it a fact, sir, that in your interrogatories to the Resolution Trust Corporation you indicated that you could not remember any such conversations?</P>

<P>A: That's correct, I don't remember having them.</P>

<P>Q: OK. Does that preclude, then, sir, conversations which you no longer recall?</P>

<P>A: Well, if you mean could David Hale have said, Hello, Governor,'' when he was in the Capitol or something like that, I suppose that could have occurred. There were no substantive business-related conversations.</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: May I have a second, Your Honor?</P>

<P>THE COURT: Yes.</P>

<P>MR. JAHN: Pass the witness, Your Honor.</P>

<P>THE COURT: Mr. Heuer?</P>

<P>MR. HEWER: Your Honor, can we have a five-minute break at  this point in time?</P>

<P>THE COURT: Yes. We'll give you 10.</P>

<P>MR. HEWER: Thank you, Your Honor.</P>

<P>THE WITNESS: Thank you, Your Honor.</P>

<P>MR. HEWER: May it please the Court.</P>

<P>THE COURT: All right, Mr. Heuer.</P>

<P>MR. HEWER: I have absolutely no questions on redirect, Your Honor.</P>

<P>THE COURT: Mr. Collins or Mr. Brown?</P>

<P>MR. BROWN: May it please the Court, on behalf of Governor Tucker, we have no further questions. Thank you, Mr. President.</P>

<P>THE COURT: Mr. McDaniel?</P>

<P>MR. McDANIEL: Yes, Your Honor. Thank you. And on behalf of  Susan McDougal, no further questions. Thank you, Mr. President.</P>

<P>THE COURT: All right. The Court would like to express its thanks to the attorneys, the president, and the excellent staff people you have who have worked with us diligently in setting up these facilities, and, listen, they have really impressed the staff, and they have an open - an open invitation to return to this facility whenever they are in the Arkansas area.</P>

<P>THE WITNESS: Thank you, Your Honor.</P>

<P>THE COURT: That being the case, we will bring this to a close.</P>

<P>(Signature waived.)</P>

<P>(WHEREUPON, at 5:58 p;m., the taking of the above-entitled deposition was concluded.)</P>

<P>Here is the order issued Feb. 5, 1996 by U.S. District Judge George Howard Junior allowing for a subpoena of President Clinton for the trial of Susan and James McDougal and Governor Jim Guy Tucker.</P>
<HR WIDTH=525 ALIGN=LEFT>
<PRE>
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
plaintiff  
 
v.  

JAMES B. MCDOUGAL,
JIM GUY TUCKER AND
SUSAN H. MCDOUGAL, 
defendants
 
   Currently pending before the court is the request of defendants 
Susan H. McDougal and James B. McDougal for an order of this 
court directing the clerk of the court to issue a witness subpoena 
for President William Jefferson Clinton to appear and give 
testimony during the trial of this matter which is scheduled to 
commence on March 4, 1996. 
 
   After cautiously and heedfully reviewing defendants' request, the 
court is persuaded that the request is made in good faith and is 
reasonable; that the expected testimony of the president is relevant 
to some of the issues to be litigated in this action; and that the 
anticipated testimony of the president is vital in affording 
defendants a fair trial and an adequate defense. Accordingly, 
defendants' request is granted and the clerk of this court is 
authorized to issue the requested subpoena. 
 
   In an effort to avoid the likelihood that the president's personal 
appearance will have a negative impact on his ability to perform 
his duties as the chief executive of this nation, the court directs 
defense counsel to communicate with counsel for the president and 
coordinate a schedule for the president's appearance. If, however, it 
is concluded that the president's personal appearance is not tenable, 
counsel are directed to consider other options for presenting the 
president's testimony, for example, via videotape or satellite. 
 
   The court further finds that any costs incurred in implementing 
this order shall be borne by the government. 
 
  It is so ordered this fifth day of February, 1996.

<P>President Clinton's lawyers have asserted that notes of a meeting held in the law offices of Williams & Connolly regarding "Whitewater matters" in November 1993 are protected by attorney-client privilege.</P>

<P>Here is the letter the law firm has sent to the Senate Committee investigating Whitewater.</P>
<HR WIDTH=525 ALIGN=LEFT>
<PRE>
SUBMISSION OF WILLIAMS & CONNOLLY 
TO THE SPECIAL SENATE COMMITTEE REGARDING 
WHITEWATER AND RELATED MATTERS 
 
I. INTRODUCTION. 
 
On December 8, 1995, the Special Committee to Investigate 
Whitewater Development Corporation and Related Matters 
served a subpoena on William H. Kennedy, III, former 
Assistant White House Counsel, for documents in his 
possession relating to a meeting he attended on November 5, 
1993, at the law offices of Williams & Connolly, personal 
counsel to the President and Mrs. Clinton on so-called 
"Whitewater" matters. Mr. Kennedy has respectfully declined 
to comply with this subpoena on privilege grounds. In the 
transmittal letter accompanying the subpoena, the Chairman 
invited Mr. Kennedy "to submit . . . a legal memorandum 
which sets forth the basis for your refusal to comply with 
the subpoena." Because Mr. Kennedy's response to the 
subpoena is pursuant to the instructions of this law firm 
and of } the White House Counsel's Office, both entities 
are submitting separate memoranda stating the reasons why 
privilege applies to the documents sought by this subpoena. 
 
Two points cannot be overemphasized: first, the issue here 
is not the subpoenaed notes. The issue is the 
confidentially of the President and Mrs. Clinton's 
relationship with their personal lawyer. If they make the 
notes public, partisan investigators will next claim that 
they have waived the confidentiality of that entire 
relationship. That risk alone creates the need to maintain 
the confidentiality of the notes. Second, a President must 
be able to receive confidential legal advice about any 
personal matter including personal matters that might 
affect his public duties. The President and the Presidency, 
although distinct conceptually, are at times inseparable 
practically. On matters of common interest, the lawyers for 
each -- White House counsel and personal counsel  -- must 
be able to talk frankly in confidence, and delineate areas 
of responsibility, just as the President must be able to 
talk in confidence to both. Without such exchanges, neither 
lawyer could obtain the full picture necessary to offer 
sound advice, and neither could be effective in his or her 
role. The  President could not receive the legal advice he 
needs to conduct  his public and personal business. 
Moreover, the last decade has, for better or for worse, 
been a time when public policy  differences have been 
improperly referred to the criminal process, rather than 
resolved by the give and take of political debate, when 
motives are impugned and the specter of wrongdoing is 
raised at every turn, and when bareknuckle tactics rather 
than civility are the order of the day./1/ Today, when 
politics is too often practiced as a blood sport, a 
President, like any other elected official and like any 
citizen, deserves the full right to legal counsel, for he 
may be beset by overzealous or partisan investigators whose 
motive is not simply to uncover the truth but rather to do 
him political damage. 
 
These simple points alone compel the decision to resist the 
Special Committee's subpoena. 
 
        *      *       * 
 
For the reasons set forth in this memorandum, the November 
5, 1993, meeting is plainly protected by both the 
attorney-client privilege and the attorney work-product 
doctrine This was a meeting of present and past personal 
counsel for the President and Mrs. Clinton and of attorneys 
doing legal work in the White House. The purpose of the 
meeting was to brief new personal counsel and members of 
the White House Counsel's Office on "Whitewater" matters 
and to agree upon an appropriate division of responsibility 
for Whitewater" legal duties between personal and White 
House counsel. Indeed, as the following legal analysis 
demonstrates, the meeting is so clearly protected in so 
many different ways that the Special Committee's attempt to 
invade the privileged relationship is puzzling, 
particularly in view of the numerous permissible ways in 
which the Special Committee may gather relevant information 
concerning the meeting, which the Special Committee's 
counsel have not even attempted to date. 
 
The President and Mrs. Clinton have afforded comprehensive 
and unprecedented cooperation in every investigation into 
"Whitewater" matters. They have voluntarily produced tens 
of thousands of pages of documents to this Committee, the 
RTC, and the Independent Counsel. They have each testified 
three times under oath for the Independent Counsel, they 
have answered voluminous interrogatories for the RTC, and 
Mrs. Clinton has provided information under oath to both 
the FDIC and this Committee. 
 
For this Committee, however, it appears that no degree of 
cooperation is sufficient. As the hearings drag beyond 
their thirtieth day and face low ratings and flagging 
public interest, the Committee majority is plainly 
attempting to manufacture a controversy so that it can 
allege (finally) a failure of cooperation by the Clintons. 
It appears that the majority has made a conscious and 
concerted decision to spark this battle over the exercise 
of a privilege which, however well established as a matter 
of law, will provide a specious occasion to cry "Coverup!" 
Whatever partisan and political advantage there may be to 
this grandstanding, as a matter of law this unprecedented 
attempt is wholly devoid of merit. 
 
II. BACKGROUND TO THE NOVEMBER 5, 1993 MEETING. 
 
Starting on October 31, 1993, and in the days immediately 
following, there was a torrent of press discussion of the 
many matters now known collectively as "Whitewater." A 
review of these press accounts establishes that, by the 
date of the meeting, there had been unprecedented public 
disclosure of the on-going federal investigations. It was 
clear by November 5 that there would be an appropriate role 
for both personal and White House counsel. 
 
On October 31, 1993, The Washington Post reported that 4 
the Resolution Trust Corporation had 'asked federal 
prosecutors in Little Rock to open a criminal investigation 
into whether a failed Arkansas savings and loan [Madison 
Guaranty] used depositors' funds during the mid-80s to 
benefit local politicians, including a reelection campaign 
of then-governor Bill Clinton." Susan Schmidt, U.S. Is 
Asked to Probe Failed Arkansas S&L, The Washington Post, at 
Al. Citing "government sources familiar with the probe," 
the Post article presented a detailed picture of the RTC 
referrals. Id. 2/ It reported that the RTC had referred 
About 10 matters arising from transactions at" Madison to 
United States Attorney Paula Casey approximately three 
weeks earlier, and that the referrals included "questions 
about whether a series of checks written on Madison 
accounts ended up in Clinton's campaign fund." Id. 3/ 
 
The Washington Post story was only the first of a series of 
articles in the Post and other newspapers disclosing in  an 
extraordinary way reams of details about on-going federal 
investigative efforts. On November 1, 1993, The Wall Street 
Journal confirmed the existence of an investigation into 
Madison  Guaranty and publicized a second parallel federal 
investigation by federal prosecutors and the Small Business 
Administration regarding a former judge, David Hale, who 
was involved in the collapse of Capital Management 
Services, Inc., an SBA-funded small business investment 
company (SBIC). Bruce Ingersoll and Paul Barrett, U.S. 
Investigating S&L Chiefs '85 Check to Clinton. SBA-Backed 
Loan to Friend, The Wall Street Journal, at Ad. The Journal 
reported an investigation of alleged defrauding of the SBA 
by Hale's company, which it said had lent money to a firm 
owned by Mr. McDougal's wife, Susan. The article also 
stated that Mr. Hale had attempted to "stave off his 
indictments by providing investigators with information 
about Madison Guaranty's Possible misuse of funds for 
political purposes." Id. News of the federal investigations 
also carried by newspapers abroad. Martin Walker, Clintons' 
Associate to be Investigated, The Guardian, at 11. 
 
On November 2, 1993, both The Washington Post and The New 
York Times carried stories providing additional facts about 
the federal investigations. The Post reported that the FBI 
had raided the offices of Mr. Hales firm the previous 
summer and had "seized documents that included records of 
a $300,000 loan to a public relations company headed by 
Susan McDougal, a partner in Whitewater." Michael Isikoff 
and Howard Schneider, Clintons' Former Real Estate Firm 
Probed, The Washington Post, at A1. The New York Times 
described an alleged close business and professional 
relationship between then-Governor Clinton and Mr. McDougal 
and reported that RTC investigators were interested in a 
potential link between campaign contributions made by 
Madison Guaranty to then-Governor Clinton and efforts by 
Madison to get state bank regulators to approve a stock 
plan. Jeff Gerth and Stephen Engelberg, U.S. Investigating 
Clinton's Links to Arkansas S.& L., The New York Times, at 
A20. 4/ 
 
The stories continued the next day. The Washington Post ran 
an article on November 3, 1993, detailing what it described 
as a possible conflict of interest in the Rose Law Firm's 
representation of the FDIC, which had taken over Madison 
Guaranty, an institution which, the Post reported, the law 
firm had previously represented in 1985 when the S & L 
sought state regulatory approval for a plan to raise new 
capital. The representation was in a lawsuit against the 
S&L's former accounting firm. Susan Schmidt, Regulators Say 
They Were Unaware of Clinton Law Firm's S&L Ties, The 
Washington Post, at A4./5 , The Arkansas Democrat Gazette 
reported that a July 1993 FBI raid on Mr. Hale's office 
disclosed documents detailing a $300,000 loan to Susan 
McDougal, some of the proceeds of which "were used to 
finance a large purchase of rural property from the 
International Paper Co. by Whitewater in October 1986." 
Noel Oman, "Old Story " Clinton Says of Links to McDougal, 
Arkansas Democrat Gazette, at 11A. The article additionally 
recounted that Hale was indicted that September on charges 
that he and two colleagues "defrauded the SEA by illegally 
funneling $800,000 in and out of Capital Management to 
secure a $900,000 SBA loan." Richard Keil, Clintons Clear 
of S&L Inquiry White House Insists, Arkansas Democrat 
Gazette, at 13A. 
 
Additional stories were published November 4, 1993, the day 
before the meeting among counsel at Williams & Connolly. 
The Washington Post reported in detail on federal 
investigations into Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker's 
relationships with Madison arc Capital Management Services. 
Howard Schneider, Governor Tucker's Finances Become Probe 
Focus, The Washington Post, at A3. The Washington Times 
reported that the federal inquiry into Madison a loans 
included an inquiry into an alleged "$35,000 loan to Mr. 
Clinton to help settle 1984 campaign debts." Jerry Seper, 
What Were the Clinton Stakes in Land Scheme?, The 
Washington Times, at ' Al. It further stated that federal 
investigators were looking into what it described as "$2000 
a month in legal fees from Mr. J McDougal [that Mrs. 
Clinton received: to represent Madison Guaranty." Id. at 
A20.6/ 
 
Finally, on November 5, 1993, the day of the meeting, The 
Washington Times published another lengthy and detailed 
account of the "federal fraud investigation" of Mr. 
McDougal. Jerry Seper, Probe of S&L Chief Touches on 
Hillary's Legal Fee, The Washington Times, at Al. The 
article stated that investigators were looking into a 
$30,000 payment made to Mrs. Clinton for legal work over a 
15-month period and included the allegation that Mr. 
Clinton and Mr. McDougal Impersonally agreed to the 
payments" and that Mr. Clinton Unpicked up the checks." Id. 
The article further claimed that "the probe also is aimed 
at determining if the monthly retainer was paid to Mrs. 
Clinton through a secret bank account." Id.2 
 
In short, by the day of the meeting at Williams & Connolly, 
the details of the RTC referral and investigations by the 
U.S. Attorney and the SBA had been extensively publicized, 
and many of the allegations, facts, and issues surrounding 
the broadly defined White water matter were well known. The 
torrent of unusually detailed reporting about the RTC 
referral and the federal investigations in the week leading 
up to the November 5th meetings was vastly more specific 
than any information conveyed by the RTC to the Treasury 
Department and the White House in the September and October 
1993 "Treasury/White House contacts" meetings, which the 
Senate Banking Committee explored in the summer of 1994. 
See Appendix A. Given the thorough airing of the RTC 
referral and the federal investigations in the press 
summarized above, whatever limited confidential information 
concerning the RTC referral may have been given to Treasury 
or the White House had been published in the press by the 
time of the Williams & Connolly meeting 
 
III. THE MEETING AND WHO ATTENDED IT. 
 
The November 5 meeting occurred after the avalanche of 
publicity described in the previous section, and it had a 
number of purposes: to provide new private counsel with a 
briefing about "Whitewater issues from counsel for the 
Clintons who had been involved with those matters, to brief 
the White House Counsel's office and new personal counsel 
on the knowledge of James M. Lyons, personal attorney for 
the Clintons who had conducted an investigation of 
Whitewater Development Company in the 1992 Presidential 
Campaign, to analyze the pending issues, and, finally, to 
discuss a division of labor between personal and White 
House counsel for handling future Whitewater issues. All of 
these purposes served the larger purpose of providing legal 
advice to the President on the conduct of his public and 
private business. 
 
The meeting was set up by David E. Kendall with Bernard 
Nussbaum, White House Counsel. It was held at Kendall's law 
firm, lasted more than two hours, and was limited to pass 
and present personal lawyers for the President and Mrs. 
Clinton and lawyers in the White House Counsel's Office 
doing legal work on the emerging Whitewater matters. 
Communications at the meeting were held in strict 
confidence. Seven lawyers attended. Mr. Kendall, a partner 
at the Washington, D.C., law firm of Williams & Connolly, 
had been retained to represent the Clintons with respect to 
Whitewater matters the day before, on November 4, 1993. 
Stephen Engstrom, a partner at the Little Rock law firm of 
Wilson, Engstrom, Corum, Dudley & Coulter, had traveled to 
Washington, D.C., to attend the meeting. He had been 
retained to serve as local counsel for the Clintons a few 
days prior to the meeting. 9/ 
 
Also present were three attorneys from the White House 
Counsel's Office: White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum, 
Associate White House Counsel William H. Kennedy, III, and 
Associate White House Counsel Neil Eggleston. Mr. Kennedy 
had also represented the Clintons in the 1990-1991 period, 
when he undertook an investigation of the status of the 
Clintons' investment in Whitewater Development Company. 
This representation had continued in 1992, when Mr. Kennedy 
had advised the Clinton Campaign about the Whitewater 
investment. He then represented the President in his 
official capacity when he joined the White House Counsel's 
Office in 1993. 
 
James M. Lyons, Esq., a partner in the Denver, Colorado, 
law firm of Rothgerber, Appel, Powers & Johnson, had also 
traveled to Washington, D.C., to attend the meeting. During 
the 1992 Presidential campaign, he had served as personal 
counsel to the Clintons with respect to a number of 
different matters, and had undertaken to do an extensive 
review of the Whitewater investment, with the Denver 
forensic accounting firm of Batten, McCarthy & Associates, 
Inc. Mr. Lyons continued to represent the Clintons 
personally in November 1993. 
 
Finally, Bruce Lindsey, Esq., a former law partner of 
President Clinton's, a former counsel both to then-Governor 
Clinton personally and his 1990 and 1992 political 
campaigns, and White House personnel director in November 
1993, attended the meeting. Although not part of the White 
House Counsel's Office, be Mr. Lindsey also had done legal 
work for the Office of the President analyzing various 
"Whitewater" issues as they emerged in the fall of 1993 and 
working through counsel in Arkansas to research state law 
legal issues. He continued in that role after the November 
5 meeting. 
 
Because the purpose of the meeting was to learn the facts, 
develop legal analyses, and apportion responsibilities in 
order to enable both personal and White House counsel to 
provide competent, appropriate, and effective legal advice 
and services, the meeting was plainly privileged. 
 
IV. THE DISCUSSION THAT TOOK PLACE AMONG THE ATTORNEYS 
PRESENT AT TEE NOVEMBER 5, 1993 MEETING, AND ALL 
DOCUMENTS 
REFLECTING THAT DISCUSSION, ARE PROTECTED BY THE 
ATTORNEY 
CLIENT PRIVILEGE, THE COMMON-INTEREST PRIVILEGE, AND THE 
WORK-PRODUCT DOCTRINE. 
 
A. The Meeting Was Protected by the Attorney-Client 
Privilege . 
 
The attorney-client privilege, which originated in Roman 
and canon law, "is the oldest of the privileges for 
confidential communications known to the common law." 
Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 389 (1981) 
(citing 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence   2290 (McNaughton rev. 
1961)). The purpose of the privilege is "to encourage full 
and frank communications between attorneys and their 
clients," and Bathe privilege exists to protect not only 
the giving of professional advice to those who can act on 
it but also the giving of information to the lawyer to 
enable him to give sound and informed advice." Upjohn, 449 
U.S. at 389-91. 10/ 
 
The November 5 meeting at Williams & Connolly falls 
squarely within this privilege. Seven lawyers, all personal 
counsel for President and Mrs. Clinton or lawyers in the 
White House, attended the meeting. Each was present in his 
capacity as a lawyer, and the President and Mrs. Clinton 
understood themselves to have a privileged relationship 
with each lawyer. The meeting was held for the purpose of 
sharing information as necessary and appropriate to provide 
legal advice, analyzing the information, and dividing 
responsibility among the lawyers for handling 
Whitewater-related matters on behalf of the Clintons. This 
lawyers' meeting was held with the expectation of 
confidentiality, and it is privileged. 
 
1. The Attorney-Client Privilege. 
 
Certain basic and indisputable rules about the 
attorney-client privilege establish this point. First, the 
attorney-client privilege@ protects confidential 
communications between an attorney and his or her client 
"made for the purpose of furnishing or obtaining 
professional legal advice and assistance." In re LTV 
Securities Litigation, 89 F.R.D. 595, 600 (N.D. Tex. 1981). 
The privilege applies in both directions: to communications 
from the client to the attorney, and to communications from 
the attorney to the client. Schwimmer v. United States, 232 
F.2d 855 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 352 U.S. 833 (1956); 
Green v. IRS, 556 F. Supp. 79, 85 (N.D. Ind. 1982), afford 
without op., 734 F.2d 18 (7th Cir. 1984). It applies with 
equal force to conversations and correspondence among a 
client's attorneys, whether or not the client is present 
during the conversation or receives a copy of the 
correspondence. 11/ 
 
Second, what is protected by the privilege is the 
communications themselves within the confidential setting. 
"The protection of the privilege extends only to 
communications and no to facts." Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 395 
(quoting Philadelphia v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 205 
F. Supp. 830, 831 (E.D. Pa. 1962)), and investigators are 
free to question individuals who communicate with counsel 
about unprivileged facts known to them. But arguments that 
the information may more conveniently be obtained from the 
privileged communication are unavailing because "such 
considerations of convenience do not overcome the policies 
served by the attorney-client privilege." Id. at 396. 
 
For this reason, even if the information discussed is in 
the public domain, the fact of communicating about it with 
or among counsel is privileged. In Lehman v. Superior 
Court, 81 Cal. App. 3d 90 (1978), for example, the court 
explained, 
 
"if the client discloses certain facts to a third person 
and subsequently advises his lawyer of those same facts in 
the form of a confidential communication, there has been no 
waiver since, obviously, the client has not disclosed to 
the third person the confidential communication to the 
attorney, l.e., had not disclosed that certain information 
had been communicated to the attorney." 
 
Id. at 97. And by necessity, the attorney-client privilege 
extends as well to written materials reflecting the 
substance of an attorney-client communication. 12/ 
 
Third, the attorney-client privilege also covers 
communications between agents of a client and the client's 
attorney, again, as long as the communication was intended 
to be confidential. "[I]f the purpose of the communication 
is to facilitate the rendering of legal services by the 
attorney, the privilege may also cover communications 
between the client and his attorneys representative, 
between the client's representative and the attorney, and 
between the attorney and his representative.' Golden Trade 
v. Lee Ansarel Co., 143 F.R.D. 514, 518 (S.D.N.Y. 1992). 
13/ Courts define the term "agent" broadly to encompass a 
range of individuals, from expert consultants to relatives 
to insurance agents, whose presence is necessary to the 
purpose of the meeting and to the rendering of advice. See, 
e.g:, Kevlick v. Goldstein, 724 F.2d 844, 849 (lst Cir. 
1984) (client's father); United States v. Biros, 459 F.2d 
639, 643 (1st Cir.) (cllent's father), cert. denied sub 
nom., Raimondi v. United States, 409 U.S. 847 (1972); 
Benedict v. Amaducci, No. 92 Civ 5239 (KMW), 1995 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 573, *3-*4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 18, 1995) 
(consultant); Foseco Int'l, Ltd. v. Fireline. Inc., 546 F. 
Supp. 22, 25 (N.D. Ohio 1982) (patent agent); Miller v. 
Haulmark Transcort Svstems, 104 F.R.D. 442, 445 i (E.D. Pa. 
1984) (insurance agent); Harkobusic v. General American 
Transc. Corp., 31 F.R.D. 264, 265 (W.D. Pa. 1962) 
(brother-in-law). 
 
Nor must the client be present at a meeting between his 
agents and his lawyer for the communications during the 
meeting to be protected by the attorney-client privilege. 
Thus, for example, in Foseco International Ltd. v. 
Firelire, Inc., 546 F. Supp. 22 (N.D. Ohio 1982), the court 
held that a meeting between the plaintiff's patent agent 
and the plaintiff's lawyer fell    ! within the scope of 
the attorney-client privilege, even though the Plaintiff 
was not present at the meeting. As the court explained, 
 
"these communications are in essence communications between 
the client and the client's attorney. The British patent 
agent acted at the direction and control of the plaintiff. 
Further, through the agency of its  patent agent, the 
plaintiff sought from the U.S. patent counsel legal advice 
and assistance concerning a U.S. patent application 
proceeding. Had the communications been made between the 
plaintiff and its U.S. counsel, the privilege would have 
attached. 
 
The Court finds that, given the purpose of the 
attorney-client privilege to encourage full and frank 
communication between attorneys and their clients, the 
communications made between [plaintiff], through its patent 
agent, and its U.S. patent counsel are privileged. The 
communications involved in this case were made in 
furtherance of the rendition of professional legal services 
to the client and were reasonably necessary for adequate 
legal assistance. 
 
Id. at 26.MV 
 
Fourth, the determination whether there exists an 
attorney-client relationship depends on the understanding 
of the client. "The professional relationship for purposes 
of the privilege hinges upon the belief that one is 
consulting a lawyer and his intention to seek legal advice. 
Wylie v. Marley Co., 891 F.2d 1463 1471 (10th Cir. 1989). 
Accordingly, the attorney client privilege applies to 
confidential communications between an individual and a 
person he reasonably believes to be his attorney, even if 
the attorney ultimately elects not to represent the client, 
and even if the attorney is not a member of the bar. /15 
 
Finally, it is important to note that the attorney-client 
privilege affords absolute protection to privileged 
communications. As the Ninth Circuit explained in Admiral 
Insurance Co. v. United States District Court, 881 F.2d 
1486 (9th Cir. 1989), 
 
 "the principal difference between the attorney-client 
privilege and the work-product doctrine, in terms of the 
protections each provides, is that the privilege cannot be 
overcome by a showing of need, whereas a showing of need 
may Justify discovery Of a! attorney S work product. Id. at 
1494 (quotation omitted). The attorney-client privilege 
cannot be vitiated by a claim that the information sought 
is unavailable from any other source. Id. at 1495. "Such an 
exception would either destroy the privilege or render it 
so tenuous and uncertain that it would be Little better 
than no privilege at all.'' Id. (quotation omitted)." 
 
2. The Attorney-Client Privilege Covers the November 5, 
1993 Meeting. 
 
a. Meeting Among Counsel. 
 
With these basic principles in mind, the analysis is 
straightforward and the answer clear. Every person present 
at the November 5, 1993 meeting was a lawyer whom the 
President and Mrs. Clinton understood to be representing 
them in either their personal or official capacities. 
Messrs. Kendall, Engstrom and Lyons were private attorneys 
acting as personal legal counsel for the Clintons at the 
time of the meeting. Messrs. Kennedy, Eggleston, and 
Nussbaum worked in the Office of White House Counsel and 
represented the Office of the President, including the 
President and First Lady in their official capacities, at 
that time. Mr. Lindsey was an attorney who had represented 
Mr. Clinton in the past; as of November 1993 he was working 
in the White House Personnel Office and also assisting the 
President (in his official capacity) on Whitewater, 
gathering information, determining how to respond to press 
calls, and providing legal advice and analysis to the 
Office of the President concerning matters occurring in 
Arkansas before 1993. 
 
Every attorney present at the November 5, 1993 meeting 
intended that the discussion that took place remain 
confidential The President and Mrs. Clinton also expected, 
and fully intended, that the conversation that took place 
among the counsel at the meeting remain privileged and 
confidential Indeed, attendance at the meeting was limited 
to these lawyers for this very reason. 
 
The discussion at the meeting concerned information and 
analysis necessary to the ability of private and White 
House counsel to represent the Clintons effectively in 
connection with Whitewater-related matters. The meeting 
facilitated the rendering of legal services to the Clintons 
by both private and White House counsel, and the 
communications that took place during the meeting without 
question "were made in furtherance or { the rendition of 
professional legal services to the client and were 
reasonably necessary for adequate legal assistance." 
Foseco, 546 F. Supp. at 26. 
 
Since the November 5 meeting among counsel for the 
President and Mrs. Clinton was held for the purpose of 
enabling counsel to provide legal advice to them, the 
conversation that took place falls at the heart of the 
attorney-client privilege. See Natta, 418 F.2d at 637; 
Chicaao Lawverst Committee, No. 76C1982, slip. op. (N.D. 
Ill. Apr. 27, 1981); Green, 556 F. Supp. i at 85; Foseco, 
546 F. Supp. at 25; In re D.H. Overmyer Telecasting Co., 
470 F. Supp. 1250, 1254-55 (S.D.N.Y. 1979); Burlington 
Indus., 65 F.R.D. at 36. Notes taken by counsel during the 
meeting, which reflect the substance of the discussion ; 
during the meeting, are necessarily protected as well. See 
Natta, 418 F.2d at 637 n.3; Green, 556 F. Supp. at 85. 
 
b. Meeting Among Client's Agents and Counsel. 
 
Mr. Lindsey was acting as the Clintons' lawyer at the 
meeting; but even if he had not been, as some on the 
Special Committee have suggested, his presence would in no 
respect have vitiated the attorney-client privilege. Mr. 
Lindsey was not only a lawyer but also a counselor to and 
agent of the President. Mr. Lindsey imparted information 
required by both personal and White House counsel in order 
to effectively represent the President, and he received 
information and advice necessary for him to assist the 
Office of the President in its functioning. It is 
well-settled that agents of a client may meet with counsel 
in furtherance of the attorney-client relationship. See 
Foseco, 546 F. Supp. at 25; Benedict, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
at *3-4; Farmaceutisk Laboratorium Ferrina, 864 F. Supp. at 
1274; American Colloid Co., 1993 U.S. Dist LEXIS 7619 at 
*2-3; Carte Blanche, 130 F.R.D. at 33-34. Because Mr. 
Lindsey participated in the meeting with the expectation 
(shared by all present) that the discussion would remain 
confidential, and because he was able to provide 
information and analysis essential to the purpose of the 
meeting, his presence was completely consistent with the 
privilege. Under this scenario as well, the meeting was 
plainly privileged. 
 
B. The 1993 Meeting Was Protected by the "Common Interest" 
Privilege. 
 
1. The Common Interest Privilege. 
 
The meeting was also protected by the "common interest" 
privilege, which enables counsel for clients with a common 
interest "to exchange privileged communications and 
attorney work product in order to adequately prepare a 
defense without waiving either privilege."  16/ The 
privilege encompasses notes and memoranda of statements 
made at meetings among counsel and their clients with a 
common interest, as well as the statements themselves. In 
re Grand Jury Subpoena Dated Nov. 16 1974, 406 F. Supp. 
381, 384-94 (S.D.N.Y. 1975). The rationale for this 
well-accepted privilege is readily apparent: 
 
Whether an action is ongoing or contemplated, whether the 
jointly interested persons are defendants or plaintiffs, 
and whether the litigation or potential litigation is civil 
or criminal, the rationale for the joint defense rule 
remains unchanged: persons who share a common interest in 
litigation should be able to communicate with their 
respective attorneys and with each other to more 
effectively prosecute or defend their claims. 
 
In re Grand Jury Subpoenas, 89-3 & 89-4, 902 F.2d 244, 249 
(4th Cir. 1990). See also 2 Stephen A. Saltzberg, et al., 
Federal Rules of Evidence Manual 599 (6th ed. 1994) 
('Saltzberg") ("In many cases it is necessary for clients 
to pool information in order to obtain effective 
representation. So, to encourage information-pooling, the 
common interest rule treats all involved attorneys and 
clients as a single attorney-client unit, at least insofar 
as a common interest is pursued.") 
 
Thus, the common interest privilege may be asserted with 
respect to communications among counsel for different 
parties if "(1) the disclosure is made due to actual or 
anticipated litigation or other adversarial proceedings; 
(2) for the purposes of furthering a common interest; and 
(3) the disclosure is made in a manner not inconsistent 
with maintaining confidentiality against adverse parties." 
17/ If these circumstances are present, the communications 
are protected. Indeed, the privilege covers communications 
not only among counsel for clients with common interests 
but also between an individual and an attorney for a 
different party with a common interest. 18/ 
 
Of course, no two individuals or entities' interests will 
be totally congruent, and it is not necessary for every 
party's interest to be identical for the common interest 
privilege to apply; rather, the parties must have a "common 
purpose." United States v. McPartlin, 595 F.2d 1321, 
1336-37 (7th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 833 (1979). 
The question my of whether the parties share a 'common 
interest' "must be evaluated as of the time that the 
confidential information is disclosed." Holland, 885 F. 
Supp. at 6. 
 
2. The Common-Interest Privilege Covers the November 5, 
1993 Meeting 
 
All of the elements necessary for the proper assertion of 
a common interest privilege were present during the 
November 1993 meeting at Williams & Connolly. All of the 
attorneys present intended that their conversation remain 
confidential. As 4 a result of the reports regarding RTC 
referrals, all of the attorneys anticipated the possibility 
of adversarial proceedings at the time the meeting took 
place. Finally, all counsel present represented clients 
with common interests and purposes -- i.e., the President 
and Mrs. Clinton in their official and personal capacities. 
19/ 
 
As the submission of the White House establishes, it is 
critical for the lawyers in the White House to coordinate 
and consult with private counsel for the President and 
First Lady in order to fulfill their professional 
obligations. It is equally essential for personal counsel 
to talk with White House lawyers, in order to fully 
understand the facts and circumstances pertinent to their 
representation. It cannot be disputed that the President 
and the Presidency have a common interest; while it is 
conceivable that that interest could diverge --indeed, that 
is one reason for separate official and personal counsel -- 
the possibility of a future divergence in no respect 
undermines the privilege. And it is settled that private 
and government counsel may share a common interest. In 
United States v. American Tel. & N Tel. Co., 642 F.2d 1285, 
1300-1301 (D.C. Cir. 1980), for example, the court applied 
the "common interest" privilege to materials shared between 
a private company, MCI, at the government, and held that 
MCI did not waive the work-product privilege by sharing 
documents with the government in aid of a common purpose. 
Thus, the common interest privilege is applicable to the 
November 5, 1993, meeting and protects from disclosure the 
substance of the 4 communications that took place during 
the meeting, as well as notes and other documents 
reflecting the substance of those communications. 
 
And again, even if Mr. Lindsey had not been acting in { his 
capacity as counsel for the President at the November 5, 
1993 1 meeting, his presence at the meeting would not 
vitiate the common interest privilege. Just as an agent's 
presence at a meeting with counsel does not void the 
privilege, see McPartlin, 595 F.2d | at 1336, the presence 
of an appropriate agent at a joint defense meeting would 
not undermine the applicability of the privilege. 20/ 
 
C. Documents Reflecting the Discussion that Took Place at 
the November 5, 1993 Meeting Are Protected by the 
Work-Product Doctrine. 
 
The subpoenaed notes are also protected separately under 
the work product doctrine. 
 
1. The Work Product Doctrine. 
 
"The work product doctrine is an independent source of 
immunity from discovery, separate and distinct from the 
attorney-client privilege." In re Grand Jury, 106 F.R.D. 
255, 257 (D.N.R. 1985). It is "broader than the 
attorney-client privilege; it protects materials prepared 
by the attorney, whether or not disclosed to the client, 
and it protects material prepared by agents for the 
attorney." In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 601 F.2d 162, 171 
(5th Cir. 1979) (citations omitted). 
 
Unlike the attorney-client privilege, which "is not limited 
to communications made in the context of litigation, or 
even a specific dispute," Coastal States Gas Comm. v. 
Department of Energy, 617 F. 2d 854, 862 (D . C. Cir. 1980) 
,21/ the work- product doctrine "protects the work of the 
attorney done in preparation for litigation In re Grand 
Jury Proceedings, 33 F.3d 342, 348 (4th Cir. 1994). 
However, litigation need only be contemplated at the time 
the work is performed for the doctrine to apply, see 
Holland, 885 F. Supp. at 7, and the term "litigation@ is 
defined broadly to encompass the defense of administrative 
and other federal investigations . 22/ 
 
As the Supreme Court observed in Hickman v. Taylor, 329 
U.S. 495 (1947), the work-product doctrine is critical to 
a lawyer's ability to render professional services to his 
client: 
 
"it is essential that a lawyer work with a certain | degree 
of privacy, free from unnecessary intrusion by opposing 
parties and their counsel. Proper preparation It of a 
client's case demands that he assemble information, sift 
what he considers to be the relevant go from the irrelevant 
facts, prepare his legal theories { and plan his strategy 
without undue and needless ! interference. . . . This work 
is reflected of course, be in interviews, statements, 
memoranda, correspondence, briefs, mental impressions, 
personal beliefs, and countless other tangible and 
intangible ways . . . . 
 
Were such materials open to opposing counsel on mere 
demand, much of what is now put down in writing would 
remain unwritten. An attorney's thoughts, heretofore I 
inviolate, would not be his own. Inefficiency, | unfairness 
and sharp practices would inevitably develop in the giving 
of legal advice and in the preparation of cases for trial. 
The effect on the legal profession would be demoralizing. 
And the interests of the clients and the cause of justice 
would be poorly served. Id. at 510-11. 
 
Although "factual" work-product may be discoverable upon a 
showing of substantial need for the information sought, the 
protection afforded to "opinion" work-product -- which 
reflects counsel's subjective beliefs, impressions, and 
strategies regarding a case -- is nearly absolute. As the 
D.C. Circuit explained in In re Sealed Case, 676 F.2d 793, 
809-10 (D.C. Cir. 1982), "to the extent that work product 
reveals the opinions, judgments, and thought processes of 
counsel, it receives some higher level of protection, and 
a party seeking discovery must show extraordinary 
justification." Accord Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 401 (opinion 
work product "cannot be disclosed simply on a showing of 
substantial need and inability to obtain the equivalent 
without undue hardship"). 
 
2. Notes Counsel During the Meeting Are Protected by the 
Work Product Doctrine. 
 
The subpoenaed notes fall directly within this protection. 
In addition to reflecting the substance of communications 
at the meeting, the notes Mr. Kennedy took during the 
November 5, 1993 meeting also reflect the thoughts, 
impressions, and strategies of the lawyers present. Each 
lawyer at the meeting brought different knowledge and 
expertise, each was there because of a common interest, and 
the questions asked, analyses offered, and conclusions 
reached all reflected the particular focus and input of 
these particular lawyers. That is the core of work product, 
and the notes are squarely protected from disclosure by the 
opinion prong of work-product doctrine as 2 well as the 
attorney-client privilege. They are, in short, "doubly 
non-discoverable." MCI, 124 F.R.D. at 687. 
 
V. THE PRIVILEGE SHOULD BE HONORED HERE. 
 
For a President, an assertion of privilege is extremely 
difficult . Such a claim, no matter how legitimate, 
inevitably leads partisan opponents to cry "stonewall." 
That is a predictable and irresistibly convenient political 
ploy. To date, the Special Committee, like the Independent 
Counsel, the RTC, and the House of Representatives, has 
received extraordinary cooperation from the President in 
its investigative efforts. But now, confronted with an 
increasingly popular President and public disinterest in 
Whitewater, the Special Committee majority is pushing its 
demands for access unreasonably into the privileged It 
relationship with personal counsel. 
 
In light of this effort, the easiest course would be simply 
to disclose one more document, to join the tens of 
thousands of confidential White House and personal 
documents already made available to the Senate. But this 
time the demand of the Special Committee majority, and its 
claim of "stonewalling are deeply unfair and, under the 
circumstances, require that a line be drawn to protect an 
important legal right: the President and Mrs. Clinton's 
privilege to consult confidentially with their private 
counsel, and that counsel's need to work with White House 
lawyers in order .to provide informed advice. It is the 
appropriate line to draw for at least two reasons: (1) 
because the right to consult in confidence with one's own 
lawyer is a right every citizen enjoys and respects, and 
(2) because the information the committee says it needs is 
otherwise available to it. 
 
(l) Regarding the right to consult with counsel, as stake 
here is the confidentiality of the Clintons on-going legal 
representation. As every lawyer well knows, counsel must be 
scrupulous not to allow even the smallest intrusion into 
the attorney-client relationship. Once there is any such 
intrusion, no matter if only a single disclosed document, 
adversaries can be counted upon to demand more. They would 
argue that there has been a waiver of the privilege 
with respect to all communications on the same subject 
matter and with the same counsel. There can be no doubt 
that the various investigators would do just that, and a 
court would have to decide, ultimately, the scope of the 
waiver, if any. Thus, any disclosure of communications, 
like the subpoenaed notes, that are a part of that personal 
legal relationship, no matter how narrow, necessarily 
places the Clintons' basic right and ability to talk to 
their lawyers in confidence at unacceptable risk. A lawyer 
and a client who believe a communication was privileged 
must protect it if they are to protect their relationship. 
 
(2) Regarding the need for information, the Special 
Committee majority has failed to state a credible need for 
the information in the document. The majority has refused 
to avail itself of testimony available to it, by which it 
could try to obtain the information it purports to need 
without the unprecedented incursion on the lawyer-client 
relationship that it now demands. Its refusal to do so can 
only be attributed to its preference for the rhetoric of a 
fight. 
 
The Committee cites a need for the document in order to 
know what confidential governmental information, if any, 
was transmitted to the Clintons' personal lawyers at that 
meeting, and what confidential information, if any, was 
collected in light of that meeting. There are numerous 
flaws in this argument. 
 
The very premise of the inquiry is wrong. Any so-called 
confidential governmental information obtained prior to 
November 5 by any of the Participants at that meeting was 
in the press, and by no means Confidential any longer, by 
the time of the meeting. The sworn testimony of White House 
participants in the November 5 meeting, like that of 
individuals in the RTC and elsewhere with whom they spoke, 
establishes what information White House officials had 
learned by mid-October 1993 about ongoing federal 
investigations. Notably, that testimony also demonstrates 
that much of what they knew they learned foam the press, 
not from government officials. But whatever the sources, 
the press accounts beginning on October 51, Egg] about the 
Resolution Trust Company referrals, the SBA investigation, 
Madison Guaranty, David Hale, the Rose Law Firm, and Seth 
Ward, put an enormous amount of detail about the pending 
investigations on the public record. Whereas White House 
Counsel had heard vague references to RTC referrals and 
"Madison," the news stories recounted the activities of 
the various investigators in minute a detail. This flood of 
public reporting totally undermines even the premise that 
the meeting participants had any "confidential" 
governmental information to share. 
 
The present conflict is wholly unnecessary because the 
Special Committee has available to it the means to obtain 
the information it legitimately seeks without invading the 
attorney- client privilege. For whatever reason, it has 
provoked this confrontation without exhausting available 
alternatives. For whatever reason, the majority is more 
concerned with precipitating a legal fight than with 
actually trying to obtain information in an appropriate 
way. On December 7, 1995, White House and personal counsel 
for the President presented what was essentially a 
three-step framework for resolving the impasse. 
 
We emphasized that no objection would be interposed to 
questions concerning what White House personnel knew about 
official governmental information when they went into the 
November 5, 1993, meeting (as previously demonstrated, 
the  information available from White House-Treasury 
"contacts" in the September-October period was already in 
the press by November 5). Indeed, as a result of the 
President's willingness to allow the Senate extensive 
questioning of his attorneys who were present at the 
meeting, the Committee already knows (or has available to 
it) what information the White House participants had with 
them going into that meeting. The Special Committee is free 
to assume (although we make no such representation) that 
everything known by the lawyers from the White House who 
attended the meeting was communicated to Messrs. Kendall 
and Engstrom. 
 
We explained that counsel for the Special Committee is free 
to pose general questions about the purpose of the meeting. 
| An appropriate purpose is a prerequisite for the 
assertion of a legal privilege, and there would be no 
objection to questions that go to purpose, so long as they 
do not require disclosure of I communications at the 
meeting. The Special Committee has declined to ask such 
questions, yet an examination upon this subject would 
elicit relevant information without requiring disclosure of 
privileged communications at the meeting. 
 
We stated that counsel for the Special Committee is 
entirely free to test the responses it receives regarding 
the purpose of the meeting by asking what the White House 
personnel did after the meeting. The Committee may even ask 
why certain steps were taken. Indeed, it may even ask 
whether the steps were taken as a result of the meeting, so 
that the witness and counsel could determine whether the 
question might be answered without disclosing 
communications at that meeting. This step-by-step, 
question-by-question process is commonplace in litigation, 
and indeed compelled by the recognized need to protect 
confidential lawyer communications. 
 
As counsel for the Special Committee is well aware, 
whenever a privilege is invoked in litigation, it is often 
possible answers to a great many questions so long as 
privileged communications are not divulged. While this may 
be a | painstaking process, requiring the witness and 
counsel to consider after each question whether the witness 
may answer without disclosing privileged communications, it 
is possible to move forward and acquire a great deal of 
information without violating the privilege, if in fact 
answers to the questions posed would not invade the 
privilege. In its rush for a ', confrontation, the Special 
Committee majority has not availed itself of this 
time-tested way of both obtaining information and defining 
the exact bounds of the asserted privilege. 
 
The President's lawyers have proposed proceeding as we have 
described because that process could very well provide the 
Special Committee with the information it needs, while at 
the same time preserving the privilege and avoiding a 
constitutional confrontation. That plainly is the wisest 
course, and we urge the Committee to consider this approach 
seriously before demanding an intrusion into this protected 
relationship. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
For the foregoing reasons, we respectfully submit that the 
Special Committee should respect the assertions of 
privilege of William H. Kennedy, III, Esq.

 ENDNOTES 
 
[FN1] As Senator Simon noted at the Special Committee's 
hearing or December 11, 1995, in the current issue of 
Newsweek, it is reported that this Committee is targeting 
Mrs. Clinton's chief ax staff, Ms. Margaret Williams, as a 
proxy for Mrs. Clinton herself. "'We're going to crush her 
[Ms. Williams],' says one committee staffer.' Turque & 
Isikoff, Lost in Whitewater, Newsweek Dec. 18, 1995, at 39. 
 
[FN2] The article also demonstrated a familiarity with the 
referral decision-making process, reporting that "[t]here 
was protracted debate within the RTC about whether Madison 
transactions involving the Clintons should be included in 
documents sent to Casey, because the investigation focuses 
primarily on the handling of S&L funds by Madison 
officials . . . The RTC's investigators who are based in Kansas 
City were prepared to forward the information earlier this 
fall, but the decision to send the referrals on was not 
made until early October, the sources said." Id. at A14. 
 
[FN3] More specifically, the article stated that "the RTC 
has asked Casey to determine whether checks to the Clinton 
campaign were paid from overdrawn accounts with the 
authorization of Madison's owner, James 3. McDougal, or 
whether Madison loans intended for other purposes were used 
for campaign contributions Id. at A14. "RTC investigators 
have examined I irregular Madison transactions that took 
place in April 1985 and I have attempted to find out who 
endorsed and deposited a series of checks made out to 
Clinton or the gubernatorial campaign, one source familiar 
with the probe said." Id. The article noted that the 
campaign fund was maintained at an Arkansas bank, the Bank 
of Cherry Valley. As to the allegations concerning 
President Clinton, the article reported that Bathe sources 
said there is no indication Clinton had personal knowledge 
of or involvement in the transactions." Id. at Al. The 
story further divulged that, according to government 
sources, the RTC in its own investigation had gone "to 
extraordinary lengths to trace real estate transactions 
involving Whitewater Development Corporation" -- in which 
the Clintons and McDougals were partners -- and that these 
transactions were among the matters referred to the U.S. 
Attorney. Id. at A14. The RTC also had reportedly requested 
further federal investigation of Governor Guy Tucker's 
involvement with Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan. Id. 4 at 
A1. 
 
[FN4] Specifically, the Times article reported that "two 
Federal agencies have been trying to find out whether more 
than $250,000 in business loans was improperly diverted 
from Madison in April 1985 to several sources, including 
Mr. Clinton's reselection campaign for governor." Id. 
According to the article, "[t]he officials said the 
campaign received $12,000 in cashier's checks We from 
Madison, some of which appeared to have been paid for by 
the business loans." Id. But, the article reported, the 
President is neither the subject nor a target of the 
investigation, which is still in its early stages." Id. In 
addition, the Times story reported on interviews given by 
Mr. Hale in which he alleged that the $300,000 loan made by 
his company to Susan McDougal was to be used to Conceal 
questionable transactions by Madison, including indirect 
help for the Clintons." Id. According to the cited  Hale 
interviews, Madison Guaranty financed a land deal for Mr. 
Hale "in February 1986 in which he was paid hundreds of 
thousands  of dollars more than the property was worth," 
and which permitted  him to make the $300,000 loan to Mrs. 
McDougal. Mr. Hale alleged  that then-Governor Clinton 
personally pressed him to make the $300,000.00 loan." Id. 
The article additionally described  allegations That 
Madison was helping Whitewater," and that Bathe  company 
had frequent sizable overdrafts on its account at 
Madison." Id. 
 
[FN5] The Post reported that the lead attorney for the Rose 
Law Firm's FDIC representation, Webster Hubbell, had 
informed the FDIC that his father-in-law, Seth Ward, had 
been an executive for Madisons real estate investment 
company and had failed to repay substantial loans to 
Madison. The article concluded with the assertion that 
Hillary Clinton was one of the lawyers who represented 
Madison in 1985 when the failing S&L sought approval for a 
recapitalization plan from the state securities 
commissioner while her husband was governor." Id. Madison 
was also described as having made "loans to prominent 
Democrats including Mr. Fulbright and Jim Guy Tucker, a 
Little Rock lawyer ; who is now Governor of Arkansas." Id. 
 
[FN6] The article reprinted a 1988 letter from Mrs. Clinton 
to Jim McDougal requesting a power of attorney to "manage 
and conduct all matters related to Whitewater Development. 
And it provided additional details about the David Hale 
issue that the SBA was investigating, and about Mr. Hale's 
allegations about Mr. Clinton Specifically, it recounted 
Mr. balers charge that then Governor Clinton requested 
Hale's help in February 1986 at the State Capitol and a 
second time in March 19s6 at Mr. McDougals office. 
 
[FN7] The article then detailed at considerable length 
certain correspondence in the mid-1980's between attorneys 
at the Rose Law Firm and Charles F. Handley and Beverly 
Bassett Schaffer of the Arkansas Securities Department in 
connection with a Madison Guaranty matter. 
 
[FN8] The 1994 Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and 
Urban Affairs Hearing on the Whitewater Matter established 
that the RTC was extremely prone to Leaking confidential 
information. I. was thus not surprising that the press was 
able to obtain so much inside information about criminal 
referrals that the RTC had made or was in the process of 
making. In response to a question from : Senator Shelby, 
Deputy CEO of the RTC Jack Ryan responded, "Well, that's 
the problem, I think, Senator, is that the RTC does leak . . . 
[The referral information] was supposed to be 
confidential and the RTC has a responsibility to keep that 
information confidential as well. And the RTC breached that 
responsibility." 
 
Hearing T., at 61-62 (Aug. 1, 1994).    In response to a 
question from Senator Murray, Mr. Ryan responded: 
 
The responsibility for maintaining the confidentiality of 
that information, of any information, investigative or 
otherwise, that could damage a case that the RTC is 
bringing, is a responsibility first and foremost of the RTC 
itself, it seems to me, and we haven't been very good about 
keeping those matters confidential. It's almost a certainty 
abound the RTC that any matter that has any kind of public 
interest at all is leaked to the press prematurely . . . . 
[W]e're quite concerned about it. I think partly it's the 
nature of the RTC . We have 60 -- 6500 employees many of 
whom are going to be out of a job come the end of next year 
when the RTC goes out of business, so there's not much of 
an incentive for institutional loyalty. There's not much 
concern by the employees of the RTC about doing something 
that might affect their employment there, and we've had a 
lot of premature leaks of very sensitive information. 
 
Id.at 122-123. Senator Murray asked Steven Katsanos, 
Director of Communications for the RTC, "how . . . the New 
York Times received information about criminal referrals 
regarding Madison," and Mr. Katsanos responded: 
 
"I have no idea. I would like to have to concur with my 
colleagues here, and I'd have to reflect that when I was a 
reporter, I would have loved to have had the job of 
covering the RTC . It is, because of the staff here, 
because of the people within the RTC, one of the easiest 
agencies to cover. One reporter once referred to it as not 
a very challenging agency -- it's like shooting dead fish 
floating in a barrel of water. It's an exceptionally easy 
agency to cover. . . . You can get information from RTC 
staff, from RTC contractors. You can get information from 
Congressional staff and that's unique to the RTC. It's just 
since it is such a visible organization with such a 
controversial job with so many different players involved, 
it's a simple job as far as a reporter is concerned." 
 
Id. at 125-125. 
 
[FN9] Because of a potential conflict, Mr. Engstrom 
withdrew from the Whitewater representation later in 
November, 1993, and was replaced as local counsel by John 
Tisdale, Esq., of the Wright, Lindsey & Jennings firm in 
Little Rock. Mr. Engstrom presently represents the 
President in civil litigation. 
 
[FN10] As the Supreme Court also stated, Bathe privilege 
recognizes that sound legal advice or advocacy serves 
public ends and that such advice or advocacy depends upon 
the lawyer's being fully informed by the client.@ 449 U.S. 
at 389; see also Hunt v. Blackburn, 128 U.S. 464, 470 
(1888) (attorney-client privilege is "founded upon the 
necessity, in the interest and administration 5 of justice, 
of the aid of persons having knowledge of the law and 
skilled in its practice, which assistance can only be 
safely and readily availed of when free from the 
consequences or the apprehension of disclosure."). 
 
[FN11] See, e.g., Natta v. Zletz, 418 F.2d 633, 637 (7th 
Cir. 1969) { ("correspondence between house and outside 
counsel . . . clearly fall within the ambit of the 
attorney-client (collecting cases); Chicano Lawyers 
Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Inc. v. City of 
Chicano, No. 76 C 1982, slip. op. (N.D. Ill. Apr. 27, 1981) 
(attorney-client privilege extends to  meeting between 
"attorneys discussing the giving of legal advice or 
assistance in anticipation of pending litigation"); Green, 
556 F. Supp. at 85 (attorney-client privilege reapplies 
equally to inter-attorney communications); Foseco Int'l 
Ltd. v. Fireline Inc., 546 F. Supp. 22, 25 (N.D. Ohio 1982) 
("the Court finds that if the communications between 
Foseco's U.S. patent counsel and local counsel in 
Washington, D.C. were confidential communications and, 
therefore, subject to the attorney-client privileges); In 
re D.H. , Overmyer Telecasting Co., 470 F. Supp. 1250, 
1254-55 (S.D.N.Y. 1979) (conversations between in-house and 
outside counsel protected by attorney-client privilege); 
Burlington Incus. v. Exxon Corn., 65 F.R.D. 26, 36 (D. Md. 
1974) (confidential communications between in-house and 
outside counsel, as well as between two outside lawyers 
representing the same client, fall within scope of 
attorney-client privilege) (collecting cases). 
 
[FN12] See Green, 556 F. Supp. at 85 (privilege applies to 
"an attorneys notes containing information derived from 
communications to him from a client. That information is 
entitled to the same degree of protections from disclosure 
as the actual communication itself."); accord Natta, 418 
F.2d at 637 n.3 ("insofar as inter-attorney communications 
or an attorney's notes contain information which would 
otherwise be privileged as communications to him from a 
client, that information should be entitled to the same 
degree of protection from disclosure. To hold otherwise 
merely penalizes those attorneys who write or consult with 
additional counsel representing the same client for the 
same purposes As such it would make a mockery of both the 
privilege and the realities of current legal assistance "); 
Smith v. MCI Telecommunications Corn., 124 F.R.D. 665, 687 
(D. Kan. 1989). 
 
[FN13] This is particularly true in the governmental 
context. As the Office of Legal Counsel explained in a 1982 
opinion letter, 
 
"it is likely that, in most instances, the "client" in the 
context of communications between the President and the 
Attorney General, and their respective aides, would include 
a broad scope of White House advisers in the Office of the 
President. The "unfunctional" analysis suggested by Upjohn 
focuses on whether the privilege would encourage the 
communication of relevant and helpful information from 
advisers most familiar with the matters on which legal 
assistance is sought, as well as whether the privilege is 
necessary to protect and encourage the communication of 
frank and candid advice to those responsible for executing 
the recommended course of action. A corollary to this 
expanded concept of the "client which reflects the 
realities of the governmental setting, is that the 
"attorney" whose communications are subject to the 
attorney-client privilege may, in fact, be several 
attorneys responsible for advising the Clients"

Mr. Lindsey also may be viewed as a "client" for purposes 
of the meeting under the functional definition of that term 
set forth in the Office of Legal Counsel's August 2, 1982 
opinion letter. See note 13, sucra. As a White House 
official working on Whitewater-related issues, Mr. Lindsey 
was extremely familiar with "the matters on which legal 
assistance was sought," 6 Cp. O.L.C. at 496, and his 
presence at the meeting was necessary both to transmit 
information to other White House and personal counsel and 
to receive information required in order to fulfill his 
official responsibilities with respect to Whitewater. 
Accordingly, Mr. Lindsey falls squarely within the 
definition of "clients elucidated in the Office of Legal 
Counsel's opinion letter, and his presence at the meeting 
is for this reason as well fully consistent with the 
assertion of the common interest privilege.

F.R.D. 1,3 (D. Mass. 1986) ("one who consults a lawyer with

          APPENDIX A 
 
THIS COMMITTEE'S FINDINGS AS TO TREASURY/WHITE ROUSE 
CONTACTS 
 
According to both the majority and minority views in the 
Senate report on Treasury/White House "contacts," 1/ those 
meetings focused generally on the existence of the criminal 
referrals, not their specifics. And what details were known 
were more often than not gleaned from press inquiries. See 
Committee Report at 31 ("Mr. Gearan testified that he 
understood that all of the information under discussion had 
been transmitted to the Treasury by reporters."). 
 
For example, at the October 14, 1993, White House 
meeting,2/ the second of the Treasury/White House 
"contacts" and the last to take place before the Williams 
& Connolly meeting, "[all of the meeting's attendees 
testified that Mr. DeVore began the meeting and related 
what he had been told by Mr. Gerth of the New York Times." 
Id. at 27.3/ According to Mr. DeVore, Mr. Gerth told him 
that the RTC was investigating Madison and that part of the 
investigation centered on a 1985 fundraiser for then 
Governor Clinton and contributions made by checks drawn on 
Madison and deposited in another bank." Id. at 23. Mr. 
DeVore also testified that "Mr. Gerth sought his help in 
determining who had contributed the checks or who had 
endorsed the checks" and 'mentioned Governor Tucker." Id. 
 
Bruce Lindsey, a lawyer in the White House a former law 
partner of the President and a lawyer for then-Governor 
Clinton, who was analyzing legal issues in the White water" 
questions [ emerging in the fall of 1993, testified that 
the major parts of at the meeting consisted of Mr. DeVore 
describing several inquiries  he had received and focusing 
in on one of those inquiries." Id. at 28. The Committee 
Report concluded that "Mr. Lindsey's description of the 
meeting, particularly Mr. DeVore's recounting of press 
inquiries, is supported by his notes . . . . " Id. at 29. 
Those notes list reporter names and then brief notations on 
the inquiries. For example, "Madison Guaranty" and "1985 
Rose Law Firm" are written under the name of "Sue Schmidt," 
a reporter for The Washington Post. Not surprisingly, the 
information contained in the notes associated with the 
various reporters resurfaced in greater detail in the news 
stories written by those reporters that were published 
prior to the November 5 meeting. 
 
Similarly, according to the Committee Report, O'er. Gearan 
testified that he understood that all of the information 
under discussion had been transmitted to the Treasury by 
reporters.| Id. at 31. His notes also contained reporters' 
names associated with a variety of statements concerning 
the RTC's referral. Once again, the information contained 
in the inquiries It as set out in Mr. Gearan's notes 
represented the kernels of later news stories. 
 
Ms. Hanson apparently was the sole attendee at the meeting 
who testified that the information she provided on the 
referral had not come from press inquiries but rather from 
the RTC. See id. at 34. Ms. Hanson testified that she "told 
the group that the referrals mentioned the Clintons 'solely 
as possible witnesses' and that at least one referral 
related to a possible conspiracy to divert funds among a 
Clinton gubernatorial campaign, McDougal, and Peacock." Id. 
at 33. 
 
Communications to the White House prior to the October 14th 
meeting were even less detailed. On September 29, 1993, at 
the first White House-Treasury "contact" on Whitewater 
issues, Ms. Hanson had alerted Mr. Nussbaum to the 
existence of the RTC referral and the possibility of press 
leaks. According to Mr. Nussbaum's uncontroverted 
testimony, gems. Hanson told him that these referrals 
involved the activities of an Arkansas savings and loan 
association, which she may or may not have identified as N 
Madison[, and] . . . that one of the referrals involved the 
possibility of improper campaign contributions from the 
savings and loan to the Clinton gubernatorial campaign." 
Id. at 11.4/ 
 
Joining the Hanson/Nussbaum discussion a few minutes later, 
| Associate White House Counsel Clifford Sloan testified 
that "Ms. Hanson told him and Mr. Nussbaum that there had 
been eight or nine referrals, that the referrals mentioned 
the Clintons as witnesses, that the referrals mentioned a 
Clinton gubernatorial | campaign more extensively, that Mr. 
Altman had sent Mr. Nussbaum T some material on this 
matter, and [had stated] that 'there might 2 be' press 
inquiries." Id. at 12. Mr. Sloan's impression was that the 
referrals had already been made or were a 'fait accompli, 
and that the conversation lasted approximately five 
minutes. Id. The information shared by Ms. Hanson was 
published and expanded upon in news stories published in 
the week prior to the November 5 meeting. 
 
According to the Committee Report, information about the 
RTC referral was transmitted from Ms. Hanson to Mr. Sloan 
(and then on to others in the White House) on two 
additional occasions before the October 14th meeting./5 Ms. 
Hanson made telephone calls to Mr. Sloan on September 30th 
and on October 7th. "Mr. Sloan testified that she generally 
passed along to him questions which were being asked by 
reporters from the Washington Post and New York Timestw and 
that his notes were consistent with that recollection. Id. 
at 15-16. 
 
The notes taken on September 30th refer among other things 
to "9 referrals," "Whitewater Co. -- re: Clinton principals 
and "Jim Guy Tucker." Id. at 16. The more lengthy notes 
from October 7th, organized by the reporter making the 
inquiries, contain additional names including "Seth Ward" 
and the "Rose Law Firm." Id. at 21. Like the notes of press 
inquiries from the October 14th meeting, Mr. Sloan's notes 
look like the rough outlines of future news stories that 
they were.

[FN3] For the purpose of understanding the extent to which 
any  i confidential information was discussed at this 
meeting, the testimony of the witnesses is consistent and 
uncontroverted. "The differences in the witnesses 
recollections center on: (i) who told the group about which 
press inquiries; (ii) who told the group the referrals had 
been made; and (iii) whether any advice was sought or given 
with respect to how Mr. DeVore should respond to press 
inquiries on the referrals." Id. at 27. 
 
[FN4] Mr. Nussbaum also gave sworn testimony that "he 
believed  I that White House officials did not require 
further information from the Treasury to respond to press 
inquiries," and he did not ask for copies of the referrals 
or for more information about the referrals because it was 
not necessary." Id. at 13. 
 
[FN5] Ms. Hanson called Mr. Sloan a third time "to tell him 
that the press people had set up a meeting between White 
House and Treasury officials on October 14, 1993." Id. at

BRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE IN 
SUPPORT OF PETITIONER  
 
INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
This is a private civil action for damages against the President of 
the United States based on alleged pre-Presidential conduct. The 
decision below compels the President to participate in discovery 
and defend himself at trial. The United States has a fundamental 
interest in protecting the Office of the President and the powers 
and duties vested in that Office by Article II of the Constitution. 
The United States is therefore directly interested in whether, and 
under what circumstances, a sitting President may be compelled to 
take part in judicial proceedings.]  
 
 
 
STATEMENT 
 
1. In May 1994, respondent Paula Corbin Jones filed a complaint 
in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of 
Arkansas. The complaint named as defendants petitioner William 
Jefferson Clinton, the President of the United States and former 
Governor of Arkansas, and Danny Ferguson, an Arkansas state 
trooper. Respondent alleged that then-Governor Clinton had 
sexually harassed her in May 1991, and that she was thereafter 
subjected to retaliation and libel relating to the episode. 
Respondent asserted claims under 42 U.S.C. 1983 and 1985, and 
under the common law of Arkansas. She sought $75,000 in 
compensatory damages and $100,000 in punitive damages for each 
claim.  
 
In August 1994, the President filed a motion to dismiss the suit 
without prejudice or, in the alternative, to stay the suit. The 
President contended that he was immune during his term of office 
from private civil litigation arising out of pre- Presidential conduct. 
The President asserted that respondent should not be allowed to 
proceed with her suit while he remained in office, but should be 
permitted to reinstate her suit thereafter.[2]  
 
The United States filed a statement of interest pursuant to 28 
U.S.C. 517. The United States argued that, except in unusual 
circumstances, the President should not be compelled to defend 
himself during his term of office against private suits based on pre-
Presidential conduct. The United States further submitted that this 
case presents no unusual circumstances that would warrant 
allowing the litigation to proceed during the President's term. The 
United States recommended that the court stay the proceedings, 
rather than dismiss the suit, in order to avoid any possible statute 
of limitations problems.  
 
In December 1994, the district court entered an order denying the 
President's motion to dismiss but partially granting the President's 
alternative motion for a stay. Pet. App. 54-77. The district court 
sought guidance from Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731 (1982), in 
which this Court recognized absolute Presidential immunity for 
acts "within the 'outer perimeter' of [the President's] official 
responsibility." Id. at 756. Relying on the Court's reasoning in 
Fitzgerald, the district court concluded that the President is entitled 
to "temporary or limited immunity from trial" during his term of 
office for claims based on his unofficial acts. Pet. App. 70. The 
district court also based the stay on its equitable power over its 
docket and on Rule 40 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Id. 
at 71. The court held, however, that discovery could proceed "as to 
all persons including the President himself." Ibid.  
 
2. The President and respondent filed cross-appeals from the 
district court's order. On January 9, 1996, a divided panel of the 
Eighth Circuit affirmed the denial of the President's motion to 
dismiss, reversed the grant of a partial stay, and remanded with 
instructions to allow the suit to proceed. Pet. App. 1-31.  
 
The majority framed the issue as whether the President "is entitled 
to immunity from civil liability for his unofficial acts." Pet. App. 3. 
The court held that the President "is entitled to immunity, if at all, 
only because the Constitution ordains it." Id. at 16. The majority 
then determined that the Constitution does not grant the President 
immunity from private suits based on the President's unofficial 
acts. Ibid. It reasoned that the President's immunity under 
Fitzgerald for acts within the "outer perimeter" of his official duties 
represents the full extent of Presidential immunity under the 
Constitution. Id. at 8-9. The court acknowledged that the district 
court had also predicated its stay on its "broad discretion in matters 
concerning its own docket," but held that it was an abuse of 
discretion for the district court to grant the stay in the absence of a 
constitutionally mandated immunity. Id. at 13 n.9. Judge Ross 
dissented, taking the position that private actions for damages 
against a sitting President based on the President's unofficial acts 
should be stayed until the completion of the President's term 
"unless exigent circumstances can be shown."  
 
Id. at 25. 
 
ARGUMENT 
 
The decision below prohibits trial courts from staying private civil 
suits against the President of the United States during the 
President's term of office. In the view of the United States, the 
decision is fundamentally mistaken. When a private litigant 
invokes judicial processes to pursue claims against a sitting 
President, the court ordinarily should exercise its power to 
postpone the litigation until the President leaves office. By 
compelling Presidents to defend themselves against personal 
liability during their term of office, the Eighth Circuit's holding 
creates serious risks for the institution of the Presidency. Given the 
practical importance of this issue to the responsibilities of the 
Presidency, and given the shortcomings in the Eighth Circuit's 
reasoning, review by this Court is warranted.  
 
1. a. At issue here is when, not whether, the President may be 
required to defend himself against claims based on his unofficial 
acts. Resolution of that issue implicates the basic and well-
established judicial power to stay civil proceedings. Over a half-
century ago, in Landis v. North American Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254 
(1936), this Court held that "the power to stay proceedings is 
incidental to the power inherent in every court to control the 
disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and 
effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants." The Court 
recognized in Landis that "[o]ccasions may arise when it would be 
a 'scandal to the administration of justice' * * * if power to 
coordinate the business of the court efficiently and sensibly [by 
staying proceedings] was lacking altogether." Id. at 255. In the 
view of the United States, the established authority of trial courts 
to stay proceedings should be exercised, except in extraordinary 
circumstances, to defer private suits against a sitting President 
during his term of office.  
 
Whenever a litigant seeks to invoke the processes of the courts 
against the President, "the President's constitutional responsibilities 
and status [are] factors counseling judicial deference and restraint.') 
Fitzqerald, 457 U.S. at 753. To be sure, the separation-of-powers 
doctrine "does not bar every exercise of jurisdiction over the 
President of the United States. But * * * a court, before exercising 
jurisdiction, must balance the constitutional weight of the interest 
to be served against the dangers of intrusion on the authority and 
functions of the Executive Branch." Id. at 753-754. When the 
President is forced to defend himself in his personal capacity 
during his term of office, "the dangers of intrusion on the authority 
and functions of the Executive Branch" are both real and obvious. 
The substantial burdens borne by individual defendants in civil 
litigation, especially litigation seeking to impose personal financial 
liability, require little elaboration. When those burdens are 
imposed on the President of the United States, they can be 
expected to impinge on the President's discharge of his 
constitutional duties, by forcing him to divert his energy and 
attention to the task of protecting himself against personal liability. 
As a result, they implicate interests that are both public and 
constitutional in nature.  
 
As this Court noted in Fitzgerald, "[t]he President occupies a 
unique position in the constitutional scheme," one that 
"distinguishes him from other executive officials." 457 U.S. at 749, 
750. The President is the sole repository of the "executive Power" 
created by Article II of the Constitution. Id. at 749-750. Under 
Article II, the President is "entrusted with supervisory and policy 
responsibilities of utmost discretion and sensitivity," including "the 
enforcement of federal law * * *; the conduct of foreign affairs * * 
*; and the management of the Executive Branch." Id. at 750.  
 
Both constitutionally and practically speaking, the demands of the 
President's office are unceasing. See Amar ~ Katyal, Executive 
Privileges and Immunities: The Nixon and Clinton Cases, 108 
Harv. L. Rev. 701, 713 (1995). The President must attend to his 
constitutional duties continuously throughout his tenure, in contrast 
to the Congress, which is required to assemble only "once in every 
Year," Art. I,   4, and which may adjourn on a regular basis, Art. I,   
5. As a practical matter, the issues of domestic and foreign policy 
that call for the President's attention fully occupy, if they do not 
indeed outstrip, the time available for the President to respond. The 
adoption of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment, with its elaborate 
machinery for carrying out the President's functions when he "is 
unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office," testifies to 
the unique nature of the Presidency and the incessant demands on 
its occupants.  
 
Accordingly, a sitting President can defend himself against an 
action for damages, and assume all of the burdens that such an 
undertaking entails, only by diverting his time and attention from 
the demands of his office. That result would disserve the 
substantial public interest in the President's unhindered execution 
of his duties. It would also impair the integrity of the role assigned 
to the President by Article II of the Constitution.  
 
On several occasions, sitting Presidents have given testimony as 
witnesses in federal criminal cases by means of depositions and 
interrogatories, while declining to attend, or being excused from 
attending, court to testify in person. See generally Rotunda, 
Presidents and Ex-Presidents As Witnesses: A Brief Historical 
Footnote, 1975 U. Ill. L. Forum 1; United States v. McDougal, No. 
LR-CR-95-173 (E.D. Ark. Mar. 20, 1996) (order providing for 
President's videotaped deposition testimony in Whitewater 
prosecution). We know of no instance, however, in which a sitting 
President has been compelled to furnish evidence in connection 
with a civil proceeding. In any event, the burdens of participating 
in a civil suit as a defendant are far different, both in degree and in 
kind, from the burdens imposed on a witness, and the risk of 
wrongfully motivated efforts to entangle the President in those 
burdens is far greater. As a result, the historical examples of sitting 
Presidents' giving evidence as witnesses in criminal cases do not 
suggest that the President may appropriately be forced to defend 
himself against personal liability during his term of office.[3]  
 
b. This Court's decision in Fitzgerald casts light on the 
constitutional implications of subjecting the President to the 
burdens of civil litigation. As noted above, the Court held in 
Fitzgerald that the President is entitled to absolute immunity from 
claims for damages "for acts within the 'outer perimeter' of his 
official responsibility." 457 U.S. at 756. The Court characterized 
that immunity from liability as "a functionally mandated incident 
of the President's unique office, rooted in the constitutional 
tradition of the separation of powers and supported by our history." 
Id. at 749.[4]  
 
In according the President absolute immunity, the Court placed 
primary reliance on the prospect that the President's discharge of 
his constitutional powers and duties would-be impaired if he were  
 
subject to suits for damages based on his official conduct. 457 U.S. 
at 751-754. To expose the President to suits for damages based on 
his official actions, the Court reasoned, could deprive him of ''the 
maximum ability to deal fearlessly and impartially with the duties 
of his office." Id. at 752 (internal quotation marks omitted). The 
Court observed that, "[b]ecause of the singular importance of the 
President's duties, diversion of his energies by concern with private 
lawsuits would raise unique risks to the effective functioning of 
government." Id. at 751. In his concurring opinion, Chief Justice 
Burger also noted the possibility that private suits for damages 
against a President could be used for purposes of harassment and 
extortion. Id. at 762, 763 (Burger, C.J., concurring).  
 
When the President is sued for actions wholly unrelated to his 
official responsibilities, Fitzgerald's concern for ensuring 
"fearless[] and impartial[]" Presidential decisionmaking is not 
directly implicated. The more general concerns underlying this 
Court's holding, however, apply with equal force. Fitzgerald 
recognizes that "[t]he President occupies a unique position in the 
constitutional scheme," 457 U.S. at 749; that the President should 
not be diverted from attending to the national welfare by "concern 
with private lawsuits," i. at 751; and that the public interest in the 
President's unimpaired attention to his official responsibilities must 
take precedence over a private litigant's desire to obtain redress for 
legal wrongs, i. at 754 n.37. As explained above, the President 
would be faced with a "diversion of his energies by concern with 
private lawsuits," id. at 751, if he were compelled to defend 
himself against a private damage action during his term in office. 
That diversion would "raise unique risks to the effective 
functioning of government." Ibid. Fitzgerald indicates that the 
judicial system should not lend itself to such risks.  
 
c. When a sitting President is sued for conduct unrelated to his 
official actions, the demands of the Presidency do not require 
absolute immunity from liability. Rather, those demands may be 
accommodated by the more limited alternative of postponing the 
litigation until the President leaves office. Deferring litigation until 
the expiration of the President's term is sufficient to forestall the 
"intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch," 
Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 754, that would result if the President were 
required to divert his attention to the task of defending himself 
against personal liability. At the same time, deferring the suit 
preserves the plaintiff's right to seek relief for a meritorious claim. 
It affects only when, not whether, the President must answer the 
allegations; it merely delays, rather than defeats, the vindication of 
the plaintiff's private legal interests. It is thus far less burdensome 
for plaintiffs than the immunity recognized in Fitzgerald.[5]  
 
The rule we suggest is not an absolute one. In the exceptional case 
where a plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury without immediate 
relief, and where prompt adjudication will not significantly impair 
the President's ability to attend to the duties of his office, a stay 
need not issue. Absent such a showing, however, the public and 
constitutional interests in the President's undivided attention to his 
office demand a stay.[6]  
 
d. The circumstances of this case do not support a departure from 
the general rule outlined above. To the contrary, this case well 
illustrates the potential burdens that private litigation would 
impose on the President's discharge of his official duties.  
 
The President is the principal defendant in this case, and the suit 
seeks to subject him to hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
personal liability. Respondent's claims focus overwhelmingly on 
his alleged actions, and her complaint acknowledges that the facts 
surrounding those claims are hotly contested. The President's 
testimony presumably would be central to the resolution of the 
underlying factual controversy. The case therefore threatens to 
place highly burdensome demands on his time and energy. If the 
President were required to defend himself against respondent's 
claims during his term of office, he would necessarily be forced to 
divert his attention from the demands of the Presidency.  
 
 
In contrast, immediate resolution of respondent's claims is 
unnecessary to protect her interests. The complaint does not 
disclose any need for immediate relief. Respondent seeks damages 
for past actions, not relief against ongoing or future harms. 
Delaying an award of damages until after the President's term of 
office (if any award were determined to be due) would not 
appreciably affect the value of that relief. Moreover, as the district 
court pointed out, respondent waited three years from the time of 
the President's alleged actions before filing suit. There accordingly 
is no reason to believe that time is now of the essence. Nor is there 
any reason to believe that a stay will, in contrast, jeopardize 
respondent's ability to marshal evidence on her behalf.[7] In sum, 
the specific circumstances of this case reinforce the general 
rationale for postponing civil suits against sitting Presidents.  
 
2. The Eighth Circuit rejected this analysis, holding instead that the 
district court had committed reversible error in granting the 
President even a partial stay of proceedings during his term of 
office. The Eighth Circuit's reasoning is seriously flawed.  
 
a. The court of appeals concluded that "the Constitution does not 
confer upon an incumbent President any immunity from civil 
actions that arise from his unofficial acts." Pet. App. 16. That 
conclusion rests on a reading of constitutional history and 
precedent that is, at best, highly debatable with respect to the 
conduct of litigation against the President during his term of office. 
In particular, the Eighth Circuit failed to give sufficient weight to 
the constitutional concerns identified by this Court in Fitzgerald. 
See pages 9-11, supra; see also Pet. App. 2531 (Ross, J., 
dissenting).  
 
In any event' even if the Eighth Circuit were correct that the 
Constitution ex proprio vigore does not render the President 
"immune" from civil actions during his term of office, that 
conclusion would not resolve the case. The question remains 
whether the constitutional and practical demands of the Presidency 
should lead a court to postpone such litigation until the President 
leaves office. The court of appeals acknowledged that a trial court 
has "broad discretion in matters concerning its own docket," but 
nonetheless held that the district court had committed reversible 
error by exercising that discretion in favor of a partial stay. Pet. 
App. 13 n.9. The court reasoned that a sitting President is entitled 
to immunity from civil suits, "if at all, only because the 
Constitution ordains it." Id. at 16. Because it believed that the 
President is not "constitutionally entitled" to "temporary 
immunity," the court of appeals concluded that it was an abuse of 
discretion for the district court to grant a stay on equitable grounds. 
Id. at 13 n.9.  
 
That line of reasoning is fundamentally misconceived. To begin 
with, official immunity is not confined, as the Eighth Circuit 
thought, to cases in which "the Constitution ordains it." See, e.g, 
Butz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478, 497 (1978) ("the doctrine of 
official immunity from   1983 liability * * * [is] not constitutionally 
grounded") (emphasis added); Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547 
(1967); Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 747 ("Our decisions concerning the 
immunity of government officials from civil damages liability have 
been guided by the Constitution, federal statutes, and history, '' and 
"[t]his Court necessarily also has weighed concerns of public 
policy, especially as illuminated by our history and the structure of 
our government."). A fortiori, no constitutional mandate is required 
for the more limited kind of "immunity" at issue in this case, which 
defers rather than denies the plaintiff's opportunity to pursue her 
claims in court. A court enjoys inherent authority to control the 
progress of cases on its docket, and it properly may exercise that 
authority to accommodate public and private interests that would 
be unfairly prejudiced by immediate litigation, regardless of 
whether it is constitutionally required to do so.  
 
b. The court of appeals concluded that sitting Presidents can be 
shielded adequately from the burdens of civil litigation, without a 
stay, through "judicial case management." Pet. App. 13. That 
conclusion is, in our view, unduly optimistic. As a defendant, the 
President has a direct financial stake in the litigation and an 
obligation to marshal his defenses. If the litigation is allowed to 
proceed during his term of office, the President will inevitably be 
required to devote significant energy, expense, and attention to it, 
even if the court regulates the timing and extent of discovery and 
Presidential testimony. The Eighth Circuit's own conception of the 
future district court proceedings, in which the President must resort 
to repeated "motions for rescheduling, additional time, or 
continuances," id. at 16, belies the notion that "case management" 
can meaningfully protect the President from the need to attend to 
outcome of the litigation.  
 
c. The Eighth Circuit's decision is also problematic in its analysis 
of the other interests involved. The majority and concurring 
opinions suggest that delaying litigation until a sitting President 
leaves office would infringe on a constitutional right of the 
plaintiff to have access to the courts. Pet. App. 10, 17, 20-21. The 
causes of action asserted here, however, are based on statutes (42 
U.S.C. 1983 and 1985) or state common law, and therefore may be 
subjected to limitations and procedures designed to protect 
countervailing public interests. Moreover, a stay affects only the 
timing of the litigation, not whether the plaintiff receives her day in 
court. As a result, the plaintiff's asserted constitutional interest is 
preserved. In this regard, we note that while the Bill of Rights 
guarantees the right to a speedy trial in criminal cases (U.S. Const., 
Amend. VI), it lacks a similar guarantee for civil litigation.[8]  
 
d. The court of appeals' decision is sharply at odds with the 
surrounding legal landscape. For example, the available evidence 
indicates that the Framers did not contemplate the possibility that 
criminal prosecutions could be brought against a sitting 
President.[9] The court of appeals' decision thus gives greater 
priority to private civil actions than criminal law enforcement 
proceedings would receive`. Yet as this Court noted in Fitzgerald, 
"there is a lesser public interest in actions for civil damages than * 
* * in criminal prosecutions." 457 U.S. at 754 n.37.  
 
In other contexts as well, it has been recognized that the public 
interest may require a stay of civil litigation. For example, a 
postponement or Stay may be appropriate during the pendency of 
administrative proceedings (see, e.g., Oscar Mayer & Co. v. Evans, 
441 U.S. 750, 765 n.13 (1979); Ricci v. Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange, 409 U.S. 289, 306-307 (1973)), criminal proceedings 
(see, e.g., 21 U.S.C. 881(i); Koester v. American Republic Invs., 
11 F.3d 818, 823 (8th Cir. 1993); United States v. Mellon Bank, 
N.A., 545 F.2d 869 (3rd Cir. 1976); 2 Beale & Bryson, Grand Jury 
Law and Practice   8:07 (1986)), arbitration proceedings (Moses H. 
Cone Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 20 n.23 
(1983)), bankruptcy proceedings (11 U.S.C. 362; Hill v. Harding, 
107 U.S. 631, 634 (1882); cf. Coit Independence Joint Venture v. 
FSLIC, 489 U.SL 561, 585 (1989) (FSLIC receivership)), or state 
court proceedings (Heck v. Humphrey, 114 S. Ct. 2364, 2373 n.8 
(1994); Harris County Comm'rs Court v. Moore, 420 U.S. 77, 83 
(1975); England v. Louisiana State Bd. of Medical Examiners, 375 
U.S. 411 (1964)). Similarly, the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief 
Act, 50 U.S.C. App. 501 et seq., provides for federal and state 
courts to grant stays in suits involving persons in military service 
in specified circumstances, 50 U.S.C. App. 521. See, e.c., Semler 
v. Oertwig, 12 N.W.2d 265, 270 (Iowa 1943); Coburn v. Coburn, 
412 So.2d 947, 949 (Flat Dist. Ct. App. 1982).[10] The 
postponement of litigation under any of these doctrines or statutory 
schemes may be lengthy, sometimes as long or longer than a 
President's  term in office. Congress and the courts have thought 
this result justified, however, because of the weight of the 
countervailing public policies supporting a stay.  
 
The constitutional demands of the Office of President require the 
full measure of the President's attention and energy so long as he 
serves. We submit that the need to avoid substantial distractions 
from the President's constitutional duties is compelling, and is 
clearly of sufficient magnitude to require a stay of civil litigation 
against the President, absent unusual circumstances not present 
here. Due regard for the institution of the Presidency under our 
constitutional structure calls for the Court to resolve this issue 
now.

ENDNOTES 
 
1 The United States has participated in other cases that have 
presented related issues of Presidential participation in judicial 
proceedings. The United States participated as amicus curiae in 
Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731 (1982), which involved the 
President's immunity from civil actions for damages based on the 
President's conduct in office. Similarly, in In Re Proceedings of the 
Grand Jury Impaneled December 5, 1972, Civil 73-965 (D. Md.), 
which involved the amenability of a sitting Vice President to a 
criminal indictment and trial, the United States also addressed the  
amenability of a sitting President to prosecution. In addition, the 
United States participated as amicus curiae in United States v. 
Poindexter,' 732 F. Supp. 142 (D.D.C. 1990), regarding the 
amenability of former President Reagan to a criminal subpoena 
relating to the Iran-Contra affair, and in United States v. 
McDougal, No. LR-CR-95-173 (E.D. Ark.), regarding the 
subpoena issued to President Clinton. The United States has 
participated as well in federal and state courts in cases involving 
the immunity of foreign heads of state. See, e.g., LaFontant v. 
Aristide, 844 F. Supp. 128 (E.D.N.Y. 1994); Anonymous v. 
Anonymous, 581 N.Y.S.2d 776 (N.Y. App. Div. 1992).  
 
2 A separate immunity issue exists with respect to one of 
respondent Jones's claims, a libel claim that concerns alleged 
statements made on the President's behalf after he took office. See 
Pet. App. 9 n.7. Neither the district court nor the court of appeals 
has addressed whether the statements at issue come within the 
scope of the President's immunity under Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 
U.S. 731 (1982).  
 
3 The production of evidence at a criminal trial has constitutional 
dimensions, since the Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal 
defendant the right "to be confronted with the witnesses against 
him" and ~"to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in 
his favor." See United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 711 (1974). 
A plaintiff in a civil action can assert no comparable constitutional 
entitlement. Cf. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 754 n.37 ("there is a lesser 
public interest in actions for civil damages than, for example, in 
criminal prosecutions").  
 
4 The Court in Fitzgerald discussed in some detail historical 
precedents regarding the susceptibility of sitting Presidents to 
judicial process. See 457 U.S. at 751-752 n.31. The Court noted, 
inter alia, that such early Americans as John Adams, Oliver 
Elleworth, Joseph Story, and Thomas Jefferson believed the 
President not to be subject to judicial process. Id. at 751 n.31. The 
Court concluded that "[t]he best historical evidence clearly 
supports'' a rule of absolute immunity for a President's official 
actions. Id. at 752 n.31.  
 
5 Somewhat different concerns might be raised by private actions 
for equitable relief, such as suits to enjoin ongoing unlawful 
conduct unrelated to the President's official duties. But when a 
plaintiff seeks only damages for alleged past misconduct, delay is 
unlikely to vitiate the relief. And there is no reason to expect, at 
least as a general matter, that postponing litigation will defeat a 
plaintiff's eventual ability to marshal evidence in support of his or 
her claims. If the circumstances of a particular case suggest an 
unusual risk that specific evidence will be lost for example, if the 
case will require the testimony of an extremely ill witness -- 
arrangements can be made to preserve that evidence without 
allowing a more general commencement or resumption of the 
litigation. Cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 27 (perpetuation of testimony). 
Postponing adjudication of private damage actions will therefore 
rarely defeat a plaintiff's ability ultimately to obtain meaningful 
relief.  
 
6 Where the public and constitutional interest in the President's 
unimpaired attention to his duties conflicts with the purely private 
interest of a plaintiff in obtaining immediate relief, the private 
interest must yield. Cf. Fitza~erald, 457 U.S. at 754 n.37 (President 
has absolute immunity for claims relating to official actions even 
though "absolute immunity may impose a regrettable cost on 
individuals whose rights have been violated"). As a result, even 
where a plaintiff can show that his or her interests would be 
prejudiced, a stay should issue unless the court further determines 
that allowing the litigation to proceed would not impair the 
President's attention to the demands of his office.  
 
7 Respondent characterizes this case as "a very simple dispute," 
involving "only a handful of potentially important witnesses." Br. 
in Opp. 10. Given the nature of respondent's claims, the principal 
witnesses presumably are President Clinton and respondent herself. 
There is no reason to expect that either party will be unable to give 
testimony after the President leaves office.  
 
8 The concurring opinion is similarly mistaken in suggesting (Pet. 
App. 17) that a stay of the litigation would infringe on the 
plaintiff's Seventh Amendment right to trial by jury. The Seventh 
Amendment concerns who will decide contested issues of fact, not 
when such issues will be decided. See Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, 
174 U.S. 1, 23 (1899) (Seventh Amendment "does not prescribe at 
what stage of an action a trial by jury must * * * be had").  
 
9 See, e.g., 2 Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention of 1787 
64-69,' 500 (New Haven 1911); The Federalist No. 69, at 416 
(Hamilton) (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (the President "would be liable 
to be impeached, tried, and, upon conviction * * * removed from 
office; and would afterwards be liable to prosecution and 
punishment in the ordinary course of law"). In In Re Proceedings 
of the Grand Jury Impaneled December 5. 1972, Civil 73-965 (D. 
Md.), the United States took the position that while a sitting Vice 
President is subject to criminal prosecution, a sitting President is 
not.  
 
10 Although we understand that the President does not claim relief 
under this statute, see Reply Br. 8 n.5, it demonstrates -like the 
other examples cited in text -- that reasons of public policy may in 
certain circumstances require postponement of civil litigation.

REPLY BRIEF FOR THE PETITIONER 
 
The President's submission is straightforward: No President has 
ever before been compelled to submit to a civil damages action, 
directed personally against him, during his term in office. A 
decision with such serious ramifications for the Presidency and the 
nation should not be allowed to stand without this Court first 
considering the President's contention, founded on both the Court's 
decisions and statements by the Framers, that such lawsuits must in 
all but the most exceptional cases be deferred until the President 
leaves office.  
 
Respondent does not -- indeed, cannot -- identify a single instance 
in which a court has compelled an incumbent President to defend a 
damages action directed at him personally. Nor does respondent 
explain why a fragmented panel of the court of appeals, rather than 
this Court, should decide the extraordinarily important 
constitutional question of whether a President may be compelled to 
do so. Instead, respondent's principal contentions are (i) that this is 
a "one-of-a-kind case" that can be litigated without interfering with 
the President's conduct of his office (Br. in Op. 8); (ii) that 
separation of powers principles permit a trial judge to require, 
review an sometimes reject -- specific showings by the President 
that a matter of state is sufficiently significant to justify altering the 
litigation schedule (Br. in Op. 12-14); (iii) that Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 
by providing Presidents with absolute immunity from liability for 
conduct within the "outer perimeter" of official duties, somehow 
precludes deferral of this litigation (Br. in Op. 16-18); and (iv) that 
this nation's historic traditions pose no bar to subjecting an 
incumbent President to civil damages litigation (Br. in Op. 19-20). 
Respondent is wrong at each turn.  
 
1. This case is evidence, if any is needed, of the wisdom of the 
Court's observation in Nixon v. Fitzgerald that "the sheer 
prominence of the President's office" makes him "an easily 
identifiable target for suits for civil damages." 457 U.S. 731, 752-
53 (1982).  Respondent's brief in opposition characterizes this 
lawsuit as a "very simple dispute about what happened in a very 
short encounter between two people in a room," and one in which 
"[d]iscovery and trial... will not be burdensome."  Br. in Op. at 10.  
The record, however, reveals that respondent's attorneys in fact 
intend to use this case as a vehicle for a far-reaching inquiry:  
 
We'll be able to ask the President certain pertinent questions.... 
Was this a pattern of conduct that involved the use of police for 
private functions that would not be... part of their duty?  Are there 
other women involved? Who are they?... [A]ll is on the table in the 
discovery deposition, including evidence that can lead to 
admissible evidence.  So it's a pretty wide-ranging effort....  
 
C.A. App. 122-23 (Tr. of ABC's Nightline (Dec. 28, 1994)). 
Respondent's counsel also stated that they will "exhaustively 
pursue" this line of inquiry with other witnesses, and may seek to 
compel an unprecedented physical examination of the President.  
C.A. App. 117-18 (Tr. of CNN's Daybreak (Dec. 29, 1994)).  
 
Respondent, in other words, envisions litigation that not only 
threatens the President with $700,000 in damages and seeks to 
impugn his reputation, but that is specifically calculated to 
entangle him in the "discovery deposition" process.  In addition, 
the district court found that discovery could not be conducted on 
even the claims against the President's co-defendant "without the 
heavy involvement of the President through his attorneys."  Pet. 
App. 76.  The inevitable consequence of such purportedly 
"uncomplicated" litigation (Br. in Op. i) will be substantially to 
divert the President from his Article II responsibilities.  
 
It takes but a single lawsuit of this kind, in Fitzgerald's words, to 
"distract a President from his public duties, to the detriment of not 
only the President... but also the Nation that the Presidency was 
designed to serve."  457 U.S. at 753.  That danger is especially 
great in the modern setting, where wide-ranging discovery is 
permitted and instantaneous, nationwide publicity is routinely used 
as a tool by litigants.  
 
Moreover, the dangers of abuse of litigation against an incumbent 
President are not limited to a single case. Respondent reiterates the 
panel majority's conception that "the universe of potential 
plaintiffs" who might sue an incumbent President -- for reasons of 
partisanship, extortion, or publicity-seeking -- is "small[]."  Br. in 
Op. at 11 (quoting Pet. App. 15).  But no person becomes President 
without having been highly prominent for an extended period in 
the public or private sector.  If the Court allows this case to 
proceed, it is difficult to believe that other potential litigants, 
encouraged by the spectacle, will not come forward in this of 
future Administrations, to use a lawsuit to distract, harass or obtain 
personal information about a President by "alleging unwitnessed 
one-on-one encounters that are extremely difficult to dispose of by 
way of pretrial motion."  Pet. App. 27 (Ross, J. dissenting).  
 
Respondent asserts that there is not extensive history of litigation 
against a sitting President being used for this purpose.  Br. in Op. 
at 11.  But there was no history of Presidents being sued for 
official acts before Nixon v. Fitzgerald.  See 457 U.S. at 753 
n.33[FN1].  The Court nonetheless granted certiorari in Fitzgerald, 
and afforded President Nixon an absolute immunity -- a much 
broader protection than is sought here -- because it recognized the 
danger that opportunistic litigation presents to the office of the 
Presidency.  457 U.S. at 753.  The risk of opportunistic litigation is 
no less in a case of this kind than it was in Fitzgerald, and this 
Court's review is no less warranted here.  
 
2.a. Respondent embraces the panel majority's view that the risk 
such litigation poses to the Presidency can be managed by allowing 
trial judges to exercise discretion over the scheduling of litigation.  
We explained in the petition why this supposed cure is worse than 
the disease: it will precipitate repeated confrontations between the 
President and federal or state trial courts, as those courts pass 
judgment on a President's requests that the litigation schedule be 
modified because of the demands of his office.  As Judge Ross 
asked below (Pet. App. 29):  
 
Is it appropriate for a court to decide, upon the President's motion, 
whether the nation's interest in the unfettered performance of a 
presidential duty is sufficiently weighty to delay trial proceedings?  
Once a conflict arises between the court and the President as to the 
gravity of an intrusion on presidential duties, does a court have the 
authority to ignore the President's request to delay proceedings?... 
[C]an a court dictate a President's activities as they relate to 
national and international interests of the United States without 
creating a separation of powers conflict?  
 
The brief in opposition seeks to create the impression that trial 
judges will be highly deferential to the demands of the Presidency.  
It repeatedly quotes Judge Beam's formulation, according to which 
a trial judge may "reschedul[e] any proposed action by any party at 
any time should she find that the duties of the presidency are even 
slightly imperiled."  Pet. App. 25, quoted in Br. in Op. 8, 12.  But 
that is not the standard established by the prevailing opinion 
below, which stated that the President could obtain relief from a 
trial judge only if he could show that a specific aspect of the 
proceedings "interfer[ed] with specific, particularized, clearly 
articulated presidential duties."  Pet. App. 16.  
 
Moreover, under either standard, once trial judges are vested with 
discretion, they inevitably will exercise it in different -- and 
sometimes highly intrusive -- ways.  While some may be 
deferential to the President, others surely will not be.  And the 
affront to the separation of powers inheres in the very fact that a 
trial judge is empowered to review the President's official 
responsibilities to determine whether he should instead devote his 
attention to a private civil action.  
 
One need look no further than this case to see the pitfalls in 
authorizing courts to review such matters. Here, the district court 
made a specific case-management determination, based on the 
particular facts of this case, that the trial should be stayed until the 
President leaves office.  Pet. App. 70-71.  The panel majority, 
notwithstanding its purported reliance on the discretion of trial 
judges, promptly reversed the stay as an abuse of discretion, 
without even explaining why the district court's evaluation of the 
facts was mistaken.  Pet. App. 13 n.9.  
 
This clash between the district court and the court of appeals -- and 
the disagreement within the court of appeals even as to the 
appropriate legal standard -- is symptomatic.  It shows that the 
separation of powers cannot reliably be protected by requiring the 
President to make ad hoc showings about how specific aspects of 
the litigation will affect his ability to carry out his official duties. It 
also underscores the need for this Court to review this important 
issue.  
 
b. In arguing that courts can oversee Presidential involvement in 
civil damages litigation, respondent, like the panel majority, relies 
heavily on the handful of cases in which Presidents have testified 
as third-party witnesses in criminal proceedings.  Br. in Op. 12-13.  
The lesson of those cases, however, is the opposite of what 
respondent suggests: they show how difficult it is for courts to 
reconcile the demands of the judicial process with the 
responsibilities of the executive branch.  
 
A President who testifies as a witness is involved in a one-time 
encounter with the judiciary. By contrast, a defendant faced with 
personal liability will be involved in every phase of the litigation. 
The opportunities for tension and conflict between the President 
and the courts thus increase exponentially. Moreover, a President 
who is a third-party witness ordinarily faces little risk to his 
reputation or financial well-being. When a President is a defendant 
in a damages action, the stakes are incalculably greater. The 
burdens and distractions that ensue inevitably will be far more 
intrusive than when the President is a witness.  
 
Nonetheless, even in the far less burdensome context of third- 
party testimony by Presidents, the experience has been that the 
process of accommodation is painstaking [2] and should be 
undertaken only in cases of compelling need. [3] Even when the 
President is just a witness, the principle of separation of powers is 
strained to the limit. The course respondent suggests -- giving a 
trial court the power to manage the President's priorities to 
accommodate personal damages litigation -- pushes the separation 
of powers past the breaking point.  
 
Finally, even in cases where only testimony or evidence has been 
sought from a President, this Court repeatedly has drawn a clear 
line between criminal proceedings -- where a compelling public 
interest is involved -- and civil damages proceedings. See Nixon v. 
Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 754 & n.37; United States v. Nixon, 418 
U.S. 683, 712 n.19 (1974). The fact that Presidents on occasion 
appear as witnesses in criminal proceedings, therefore, does not 
support the conclusion that a President is required to participate in 
a private civil damages action in any capacity -- and certainly not 
as a defendant.  
 
3.a. The brief in opposition attempts to create the impression that 
the President seeks to be held absolutely immune from liability for 
actions he took while he was not President. The President seeks no 
such thing, and respondent's elaborate arguments against that 
proposition (Br. in Op. i, 9, 15-18, 20- 22) are simply a determined 
effort to confuse the issue. Rather, throughout this case, the 
President has asserted that the responsibilities of the Presidency 
warrant a stay of litigation until he leaves office. He does not seek 
to extinguish the respondent's rights to pursue her claims, does not 
seek to evade accountability, and remains subject to the risk of 
damages.  
 
And while respondent, like the panel majority, engages in 
overblown rhetoric to the effect that the President is seeking to 
place himself "above the law" and that the relief he seeks is 
"unprecedented," even respondent is forced to concede the validity 
of the underlying principle for which we contend. She 
acknowledges that the President is not like any other litigant, and 
that the courts must show "defense" and must accommodate the 
President's unique responsibilities. Br. in Op. 12-14.  
 
b. Respondent and the panel majority suggest that Fitzgerald 
affirmative rejected the President's position here. Pet. App. 8- 9, 
10-11; Br. in Op., at 16, 23. This suggestion is, to say the least, 
odd: in Fitzgerald, even the plaintiff, although seeking to hold 
then-former President Nixon liable in damages, conceded in his 
brief that litigation against a sitting President could be stayed [4] -- 
reflecting the universal understanding, until this case, that a 
President cannot be subjected to personal damages litigation during 
his term of office. The issue in Fitzgerald was whether a President 
enjoys absolute immunity from liability for all his official acts. The 
Court decided that the President, alone among all public officials, 
is entitled to this exceptional protection. That conclusion is fully 
consistent with our view that a President who is sued for acts 
outside the scope of his office is entitled to the much more limited 
relief of temporary insulation from litigation. Indeed, as we 
showed in the petition, a crucial aspect of the Court's reasoning in 
Fitzgerald was that personal damages litigation can divert a 
President from his official duties. [5]  
 
Respondent (Br. in Op. 9, 16) makes much of Chief Justice 
Burger's statement in Fitzgerald that "[t]he doctrine of absolute 
immunity does not extend beyond [official] actions," -- a statement 
with which we of course agree. 457 U.S. at 761 n.4. (Burger, C.J., 
concurring); see also id. at 759. Respondent does not mention that 
Chief Justice Burger also said that "[t]he need to defend damages 
suits would have the serious effect of diverting the attention of a 
President from his executive duties," and cautioned that "litigation 
processes . . . can be and are used as mechanisms of extortion." Id. 
at 763.  
 
4. Respondent asserts (Br. in Op. 19-20) that President Jefferson 
"lost" his argument that subjecting Presidents to a Court's 
jurisdiction undermines the separation of powers. In fact, our 
history -- beginning at least with President Jefferson and extending 
through the Burr cases, the Fitzgerald case, and United States v. 
Nixon and its progeny -- teaches that subjecting a sitting President 
personally to the process of the courts is something that should be 
done only in cases of imperative need, and then only to the most 
limited extent possible. See Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 753-54. [6]  
 
No court has ever, until now, required a sitting President to defend 
a civil damages action directed at him personally. In fact, no court 
has ever required a President to testify in a civil case as a witness. 
What respondent seeks -- allowing a sitting President to be sued for 
damages in his personal capacity -- would be an intrusion far 
beyond anything that has ever before been allowed, or even 
contemplated. To permit such an intrusion, without even so much 
as this Court's review, is utterly unwarranted.  
 
For these reasons and the reasons stated in the petition, the petition 
for a write of certiorari should be granted.

ENDNOTES 
 
[1] The Court in Fitzgerald attributed this to the fact that Bivens v. 
Six Unknown Named Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), which 
permitted damages actions against federal officials for violation of 
the Constitution, was of relatively recent vintage.  But common 
law tort actions had long been available against federal officials, as 
justice Harlan noted in Bivens.  See 403 U.S. at 400 n.3, 409 
(Harlan, J. concurring).  The more likely explanation for the 
absence of suits against the President is that -- as we showed in the 
petition -- it was universally understood that the President could 
not be sued for damages while in office. See Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 
at 758.  
 
[2] See, e.g., United States v. Poindexter, 732 F.Supp. 142, 148- 
50, 155-59 (D.D.C. 1990) (court limited defendant to written 
interrogatories and videotaped deposition, and reviewed questions 
to be asked in advance); United States v. McDougal, No. LR-CR-
95- 173 (E.D. Ark., Mar. 29, 1996) (permitting presidential 
testimony only by way of videotaped deposition conducted at the 
White House, supervised by the trial court via videoconferencing 
to avoid abuses, after which only directly relevant portions would 
be shown at trial).  
 
[3]  See, e.g., Poindexter, 732 F.Supp. at 147 (President would be 
compelled to provide testimony for criminal trial only if court is 
"satisfied that his testimony would be material as tested by a 
meticulous standard, as well as being necessary in the sense of 
being a more logical and more persuasive source of evidence than 
alternatives that might be suggested") (footnote omitted); United 
States v. North, 713 F. Supp. 1448, 1449 (D.D.C. 1989) 
(compelled testimony of former President in a criminal proceeding 
must be justified by a "sufficient showing . . . that the . . . 
President's testimony is essential to assure the defendant a fair 
trial"), aff'd, 910 F.2d 843 (D.C. Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 
941 (1991).  
 
[4] Brief for Respondent A. Ernest Fitzgerald, Nos. 78-1783 and 
80-945 (Sup. Ct. filed Oct. 29, 1981) at 28.  
 
[5] The respondent suggests that the President is entitled to the 
relief sought here only if provided for in an act of Congress. Br. in 
Op. 11. We disagree. The relief sought here is required by the 
singular nature of the President's constitutional duties, and by 
principles of separation of powers. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 749. The 
President does not rely on, or claim any relief under, the Solders' 
and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 (50 U.S.C. Sections 501-525 
(1988 & Supp. Y 1993)), or any other legislation.  
 
[6] In the face of this Court's demonstration in Fitzgerald that the 
Framers contemplated that Presidents would not be subject to suits 
while in office (457 U.S. at 751 n.31), respondent cites four cases. 
Br. in Op. 20. Three involve the entirely different question of 
whether a President can be required to be a witness in a criminal 
proceeding. See supra, p. 6-7. The fourth, National Treasury 
Employees Union v. Nixon, 492 F.2d 587 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (en 
banc) ("NTEU"), is inapposite and of questionable vitality, and in 
any event supports our position. In NTEU, the President was sued 
for injunctive relief in his official capacity, and was not required to 
defend the litigation personally. The court of appeals stated that it 
had the authority to mandamus President Nixon to perform a 
ministerial duty, but refrained from exercising that authority "in 
order to show the utmost respect to the office . . . and to avoid, if at 
all possible . . . any clash between the judicial and executive 
branches." the court proceeded by way of declaratory judgment 
instead. 492 F.2d at 616. Contrary to respondent's suggestion, 
NTEU demonstrates that courts go to great lengths to avoid 
entangling the President in their jurisdiction. Moreover, even the 
viability of the opinion expressed in NTEU -- that a President 
could be enjoined -- is in doubt, in view of the more recent 
discussion of that issue in Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788 
(1992). See id., 505 U.S. at 802-03 (plurality opinion of O'Connor, 
J.) (citing Mississippi v. Johnson, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 475, 498-99 
(1867)); id. at 826 (Scalia, J., concurring).

<P>Lawyers for President Clinton asked the Supreme Court to delay the sexual harassment case against him by former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones until after he leaves office. In this May 15, 1996 petition for a writ of certiorari, the president's lawyers argue that litigation of a private civil damages lawsuit must be deferred until the president leaves office ``in all but the most exceptional cases.'' They argue that stays of litigation are common for military personnel under the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940. As Commander-in-Chief, Clinton qualifies for the Act's protection, they claim.</P>

STATEMENT OF THE CASE

Petitioner William Jefferson Clinton is President of the United
States. On May 6, 1994, respondent Paula Corbin Jones filed this
civil damages action against the President in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. The complaint
was premised in substantial part on conduct alleged to have
occurred three years earlier, before the President took office. The
complaint included two claims arising under the federal civil rights
statutes and two arising under common law, and sought $175,000
in actual and punitive damages for each of the four counts./1
Jurisdiction was asserted under 28 U.S.C. Sections 1331, 1332 and
1343 (1994).

The President moved to stay the litigation or to dismiss it without
prejudice to its reinstatement when he left office, asserting that
such a course was required by the singular nature of the President's
Article II duties and by principles of separation of powers. The
district court stayed trial until the President's service in office
expired, but held that discovery could proceed immediately "as to
all persons including the President himself." Pet. App. 71.

The district court reasoned that "the case most applicable to this
one is Nixon v. Fitzgerald, [457 U.S. 731 (1982)]," (Pet. App. 67)
which held that a President is absolutely immune from any civil
litigation challenging his official acts as President. While the
holding of Fitzgerald did not apply to this case because President
Clinton was sued primarily for actions taken before he became
President, the court stated that "[t]he language of the majority
opinion" in Fitzgerald

is sweeping and quite firm in the view that to disturb the President
with defending civil litigation that does not demand immediate
attention . . . would be to interfere with the conduct of the duties of
the office.

Pet. App. 68-69. The district court further found that these
concerns "are not lessened by the fact that [the conduct alleged]
preceded his Presidency." Id. Invoking Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 40 and the court's equitable power to manage its own
docket, the district judge stayed the trial "[t]o protect the Office of
President . . . from unfettered civil litigation, and to give effect to
the policy of separation of powers." Pet. App. 72./2

The trial court, observing that the plaintiff had filed suit three years
after the alleged events, further concluded that the plaintiff would
not be significantly inconvenienced by delay of trial. Pet. App. 70.
However, it found "no reason why the discovery and deposition
process could not proceed," and said that this would avoid the
possible loss of evidence with the passage of time. Pet. App. 71.

The President and respondent both appealed./3 A divided panel of
the court of appeals reversed the district court's order staying trial,
and affirmed its decision allowing discovery to proceed. The panel
issued three opinions. Judge Bowman found the reasoning in
Fitzgerald "inapposite where only personal, private conduct by a
President is at issue," (Pet. App. 11), and determined that "the
Constitution does not confer upon an incumbent President any
immunity from civil actions that arise from his unofficial acts."
Pet. App. 16. He also wrote that

[t]he Court's struggle in Fitzgerald to establish presidential
immunity for acts within the outer perimeter of official
responsibility belies the notion ... that beyond this outer perimeter
there is still more immunity waiting to be discovered.

Pet. App. 9.

Judge Bowman further concluded that it would be an abuse of
discretion to stay all proceedings against an incumbent President,
asserting that the President"is entitled to immunity, if at all, only
because the Constitution ordains it. Presidential immunity thus
cannot be granted or denied by the courts as an exercise of
discretion." Pet. App. 16. Ruling that the court of appeals had
"pendent appellate jurisdiction" to entertain respondent's challenge
to the stay of trial issued by the district court, (Pet. App. 5 n.4)
(citing Kincade v. City of Blue Springs, Mo., 64 F.3d 389, 394 (8th
Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 1996 WL 26287 (Apr. 29, 1996)), Judge
Bowman accordingly reversed that stay as an abuse of discretion.
Pet. App. 13 n.9.

In reaching these conclusions, Judge Bowman put aside concerns
that the separation of powers could be jeopardized by a trial court's
exercising control over the President's time and priorities, through
the supervision of discovery and trial. He stated that any separation
of powers problems could be avoided by "judicial case
management sensitive to the burdens of the presidency and the
demands of the President's schedule." Pet. App. 13.

Judge Beam "concur[red] in the conclusions reached by Judge
Bowman." Pet. App. 17. He stated that the issues presented "raise
matters of substantial concern given the constitutional obligations
of the office" of the Presidency. Pet. App. 17. He also
acknowledged that "judicial branch interference with the
functioning of the presidency should this suit be allowed to go
forward" is a matter of "major concern." Pet. App. 21. He
expressed his belief, however, that this litigation could be managed
with a "minimum of impact on the President's schedule." Pet. App.
23. This could be accomplished, he suggested, by the President's
choosing to forgo attending his own trial or becoming involved in
discovery, or by limiting the number of pretrial encounters
between the President and respondent's counsel. Pet. App. 2324.
Judge Beam stated that he was concurring "[w]ith [the]
understanding" that the trial judge would have substantial latitude
to manage the litigation in a way that would accommodate the
interests of the Presidency. Pet. App. 25.

Judge Ross dissented, stating that the "language, logic and intent"
of Fitzgerald

directs a conclusion here that, unless exigent circumstances can be
shown, private actions for damages against a sitting President of
the United States, even though based on unofficial acts, must be
stayed until the completion of the President's term.

Pet. App. 25. Judge Ross observed that "[n]o other branch of
government is entrusted to a single person," and determined that

[t]he burdens and demands of civil litigation can be expected ... to
divert [the President's] energy and attention from the rigorous
demands of his office to the task of protecting himself against
personal liability. That result . . . would impair the integrity of the
role assigned to the President by Article II of the Constitution.

Pet. App. 26.

Judge Ross also stated that private civil suits against sitting
Presidents

create opportunities for the judiciary to intrude upon the
Executive's authority, set the stage for potential constitutional
confrontations between courts and a President, and permit the civil
justice system to be used for partisan political purposes.

Pet. App. 28. At the same times he reasoned, postponing litigation
"will rarely defeat a plaintiff's ability to ultimately obtain
meaningful relief." Pet. App. 30. Judge Ross concluded that
litigation should proceed against a sitting President only if a
plaintiff can "demonstrate convincingly both that delay will
seriously prejudice the plaintiff's interests and that ... [it] will not
significantly impair the President's ability to attend to the duties of
his office." Pet. App. 31.

The court of appeals denied the President's request for a rehearing
en bang with three judges not participating and Judge McMillian
dissenting. Judge McMillian said the majority's holding had
"demean[ed] the Office of the President of the United States." Pet.
App. 32. He wrote that the panel majority "would put all the
problems of our nation on pilot control and treat as more urgent a
private lawsuit that even the [respondent] delayed filing for at least
three years," and would "allow judicial interference with, and
control of, the President's time." Pet. App. 33.

REASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION

This case presents a question of extraordinary national importance,
which was resolved erroneously by the court of appeals. For the
first time in our history, a court has ordered a sitting President to
submit, as a defendant, to a civil damages action directed at him
personally. We believe that absent exceptional circumstances, an
incumbent President should never be placed in this position. And
surely a President should not be placed in this position for the first
time in our history on the basis of a decision by a fragmented panel
of a court of appeals, without this Court's review.

The decision of the court below is erroneous in several respects. It
is inconsistent with the reasoning of Nixon v. Fitzgerald and with
established separation of powers principles. The panel majority's
suggested cure for the separation of powers problems^"judicial
case management sensitive to . . . the demands of the President's
schedule" (Pet. App. 13) --is worse than the disease: it gives a trial
court a general power to set priorities for the President's time and
energies. The panel majority also grossly overstated the supposedly
extraordinary character of the relief that the President seeks. The
deferral of litigation for a specified, limited period is far from
unknown in our judicial system, and it is routinely afforded in
order to protect interests that are not comparable in importance to
the interests the President advances here.

Now is the appropriate time for the Court to address these issues. If
review is declined, the President would have to undergo discovery
and trial while in office, which would eviscerate the very interests
he seeks to vindicate. Moreover, if the decision below is allowed to
stand, federal and state courts could be confronted with more
private civil damage complaints against incumbent Presidents.
Such complaints increasingly would enmesh Presidents in the
judicial process, and the courts in the political arena, to the
detriment of both.

A. The Decision Below Is Inconsistent With This Court's
Decisions And Jeopardizes The Separation Of Powers.

1. The President "occupies a unique position in the constitutional
scheme." Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731, 749 (1982). Unlike
the power of the other two branches, the entire "executive Power"
is vested in a single individual, "a President," who is indispensable
to the execution of that authority. U.S. CONST. art. II, Section 1.
The President is never off duty, and any significant demand on his
time necessarily imposes on his capacity to carry out his
constitutional responsibilities.

Accordingly, "[c]ourts traditionally have recognized the President's
constitutional responsibilities and status as factors counseling
judicial deference and restraint." Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 753. Indeed,
"[t]his tradition can be traced far back into our constitutional
history." Id. at 753 n.34. The form of "judicial deference and
restraint" that the President seeks here^merely postponing the suit
against him until he leaves office^is modest. It is far more limited,
for example, than the absolute immunity that Fitzgerald accorded
all Presidents for actions taken within the scope of their
presidential duties.

The panel majority concluded that because the Fitzgerald holding
was limited to civil damages claims challenging official acts, the
President should receive no form of protection from any other civil
suits. This conclusion is flatly inconsistent with the reasoning of
Fitzgerald. The Court in Fitzgerald determined that the President
was entitled to absolute immunity not only because the threat of
liability for official acts might inhibit him in the exercise of his
authority (id. at 752 & n.32), but also because, in the Court's
words, "the singular importance of the President's duties" means
that "diversion of his energies by concern with private lawsuits
would raise unique risks to the effective functioning of
government." Id. at 751.

The panel majority ignored this second basis for the holding of
Fitzgerald. The first basis of Fitzgerald^that the threat of liability
might chill official Presidential decision making^is, of course,
largely not present here, and accordingly, the President does not
seek immunity from liability. 4 But the second danger to the
Presidency emphasized by Fitzgerald^the burdens inevitably
attendant upon being a defendant in a lawsuit^dearly exists here.
The court of appeals simply disregarded this "unique risky to the
effective functioning of government."

2. As the Fitzgerald Court demonstrated, the principle that a sitting
President may not be subjected to private civil lawsuits has deep
roots in our traditions. See 457 U.S. at 751 n.31. Justice Story
stated that

[t]he president cannot . . . be liable to arrest, imprisonment, or
detention, while he is in the discharge of the duties of his office;
and for this purpose his person must be deemed, in civil cases at
least, to possess an official inviolability.

3 JOSEPH STORY, COMMENTARIES ON THE
CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES Section 1563, pp.
418-19 (1st ed. 1833) (emphasis added), quoted in Fitzgerald, 457
U.S. at 749. Senator Oliver Ellsworth and then-Vice President John
Adams, both delegates to the Constitutional Convention, also
agreed that

the President, personally, was not . . . subject to any process
whatever.... For [that] would ... put it in the power of a common
justice to exercise any authority over him and stop the whole
machine of Government. JOURNAL OF WILLIAM MACLAY
167 (E. Maclay ed., 1890), quoted in Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 751
n.31.

President Jefferson was even more emphatic:

The leading principle of our Constitution is the independence of
the Legislature, executive and judiciary of each other .... But would
the executive be independent of the judiciary, if he were subject to
the commands of the latter, & to imprisonment for disobedience; if
the several courts could bandy him from pillar to post, keep him
constantly trudging from north to south & east to west, and
withdraw him entirely from his constitutional duties?

10 THE WORKS OF THOMAS JEFFERSON 404 n. (Paul L.
Ford ed., 1905), quoted in Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 751 n.31. As the
Court said in Fitzgerald, "nothing in [the Framers'] debates
suggests an expectation that the President would be subjected to
the distraction of suits by disappointed private citizens." 457 U.S.
751 n.31.

3. The panel majority minimized the separation of powers concerns
that so troubled the Framers. It ruled that these problems can never
be addressed by postponing litigation against the President until
the end of his term. Pet. App. 16. Instead, the panel majority's
solution was "judicial case management sensitive to the burdens of
the presidency and the demands of the President's schedule." Pet.
App. 13. Rather than solving the separation of powers problems
raised by allowing a suit to go forward against a sitting President,
the panel's approach only exacerbates them.

The panel majority envisioned that, throughout the course of
litigation against him, a President could "pursue motions for
rescheduling, additional time, or continuances" if he could show
that the proceedings "interfer[ed] with specific, particularized,
clearly articulated presidential duties." Pet. App. 16. If the
President disagreed with a decision of the trial court, he could
"petition [the court of appeals] for a writ of mandamus or
prohibition." Pet. App. 16. In other words, under the panel's
approach, a trial court could insist, before considering a request by
the President for adjustment in the litigation schedule, that the
President provide a "specific, particularized" explanation of why
he believed his official duties prevented him from devoting his
attention to the litigation at that time. The court would then be in
the position of repeatedly evaluating the President's official
priorities^precisely what Jefferson so feared.

This approach is an obvious affront to the complex and delicate
relationship between the Judiciary and the Presidency. Neither
branch should be in a position where it must approach the other for
approval to carry out its day-to-day responsibilities. Even if a trial
court discharged this mission with the greatest judiciousness, it is
difficult to think of anything more inconsistent with the separation
of powers than to put a court in the position of continually passing
judgment on whether the President is spending time in a way the
court finds acceptable.

4. The panel majority similarly attempted to downplay the
demands that defending private civil litigation would impose on
the President's time and energies. Pet. App. 13-15. The concurring
opinion in particular likened the defense of a personal damages suit
to the few instances when Presidents have testified as witnesses in
judicial or legislative proceedings. Pet. App. 22-23. This notion is
implausible on its face; there is no comparison between being a
defendant in a civil damages action and merely being a witness.
Even so, Presidents have been called as witnesses only in cases of
exigent need, and only under carefully controlled circumstances
designed to minimize intrusions on the President's ability to carry
out his duties.

A sitting President has never been compelled to testify in civil
proceedings. Presidents occasionally have been called upon to
testify in criminal proceedings, in order to preserve the public's
interest in criminal law enforcement (Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 754)
and the defendant's Constitutional right to compulsory process
(U.S. CONST. amend. VI; United States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 30, 33
(C.C.D. Va. 1807) (No. 14,692d)) --factors that are, of course, not
present here. But even in those compelling cases, as Chief Justice
Marshall recognized, courts are not "required to proceed against
the president as against an ordinary individual." United States v.
Burr, 25 F. Cas. 187, 192 (C.C.D. Va. 1807) (No. 14,694). Instead,
courts have required a heightened showing of need for the
President's testimony, and have permitted it to be obtained only in
a manner that limits the disruption of his official functions, such as
by videotaped deposition./5

In any event, there is an enormous difference between being a
third-party witness and being a defendant threatened with
financially ruinous personal liability. This is true even for a person
with only the normal business and personal responsibilities of
everyday life^which are, of course, incalculably less demanding
than those of the President. A President as a practical matter could
never wholly ignore a suit such as the present one, which seeks to
impugn the President's character and to obtain $700,000 in putative
damages from the President personally. "The need to defend
damages suits would have the serious effect of diverting the
attention of a President from his executive duties since defending a
lawsuit today^even a lawsuit ultimately found to be
frivolous^often requires significant expenditures of time and
money, as many former public officials have learned to their
sorrow." Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 763 (Burger, C.J., concurring).

Judge Learned Hand once commented that as a litigant, he would
"dread a lawsuit beyond anything else short of sickness and
death."/6 In this regard the President is like any other litigant,
except that a President's litigation, like a President's illness,
becomes the nation's problem.

B. The Court Of Appeals Erred In Viewing The Relief Sought By
The President As Extraordinary

The court below appears to have viewed the President's claim in
this case as exceptional, both in the relief that it sought and in the
burden it imposed on respondent./7 In fact, far from seeking a
"degree of protection from suit for his private wrongs enjoyed by
no other public official (much less ordinary citizens)" (Pet. App.
13), the relief that the President seeks^the temporary deferral of
litigation^is far from unknown in our system, and the burdens it
would impose on plaintiffs are not extraordinary.

There are numerous instances where civil plaintiffs are required to
accept the temporary postponement of litigation so institutional or
public interests can be protected. For example, the Soldiers' and
Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, 50 U.S.C. app. Sections 501-25
(1988 & Supp. V 1993), provides that civil claims by or against
military personnel are to tolled and stayed while they are on active
duty./8 Such relief is deemed necessary to enable members of the
Armed Forces "to devote their entire energy to the defense needs of
the Nation." 50 U.S.C. app. Section 510 (1988). President Clinton
here thus seeks relief similar to that to which he may be entitled as
Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces, and which is routinely
available to service members under his command.

The so-called automatic stay provision of the Bankruptcy Code
similarly provides that litigation against a debtor is to be stayed as
soon as a party files a bankruptcy petition. That stay affects all
litigation that "was or could have been commenced" prior to the
filing of that petition, 11 U.S.C. Section 362 (1994), and ordinarily
will remain in effect until the bankruptcy proceeding is completed.
Id./9 Thus, if respondent had sued a party who entered bankruptcy,
respondent would automatically find herself in the same position
she will be in if the President prevails before this Court^except that
the bankruptcy stay is indefinite, while the stay in this case has a
definite term, circumscribed by the constitutional limit on a
President's tenure in office.

It is well established that courts, in appropriate circumstances, may
put off civil litigation until the conclusion of a related criminal
prosecution against the same defendant./10 That process may, of
course, take several years, and affords the civil plaintiff no relief.
The doctrine of primary jurisdiction, where it applies, compels
plaintiffs to postpone the litigation of their civil claims while they
pursue administrative proceedings, even though the administrative
proceedings may not provide the relief they seek. This process too
can take several years. See, e.g., Ricci v. Chicago Mercantile
Exch., 409 U.S. 289, 306-07 (1973). And public officials who
unsuccessfully raise a qualified immunity defense in a trial court
are entitled, in the usual case, to a stay of discovery while they
pursue an interlocutory appeal. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800,
818 (1982). Such appeals can routinely delay litigation for a
substantial period.

We do not suggest that all of these doctrines operate in exactly the
same way as the relief that the President seeks here. But these
examples thoroughly dispel any suggestion that the President, in
asking that this litigation be deferred, is somehow placing himself
"above the law," or that holding this litigation in abeyance would
impermissibly violate a plaintiff's entitlement to access to the
courts. More specifically, these examples demonstrate that what
the President is seeking^the temporary deferral of litigation^is
relief that our judicial system routinely provides when significant
institutional or public interests are at stake, as they manifestly are
here.

C. The Panel Majority Erred In Asserting Jurisdiction Over, And
Reversing, The District Court's Discretionary Decision To Stay
The Trial Until After President Clinton Leaves Office.

1. Respondent cross-appealed to challenge the district court's order
to stay trial. Ordinarily, a decision by a district court to stay
proceedings is not a final decision for purposes of appeal. Moses
H. Cone Memorial Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 10
n.11 (1983). Such orders may be reviewed on an interlocutory
basis only by writ of mandamus. See 28 U.S.C. Section 651
(1994)./11 In asserting that jurisdiction existed for her cross-
appeal, the respondent did not seek such a writ or contend that the
stay was appealable under 28 U.S.C. Section 1291 (1994) as a final
order, or as a collateral order under Cohen v. Beneficial Indus.
Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546 (1949). Instead, respondent
asserted, and the panel majority found, that the Court of Appeals
had "pendent appellate jurisdiction" over respondent's cross-
appeal. Pet. App. 5 n.4.

In Swint v. Chambers County Comm'n, 115 S. Ct. 1203 (1995),
this Court ruled that the notion of "pendent appellate jurisdiction,"
if viable at all, is extremely narrow in scope (see id. at 1212), and
is not to be used "to parlay Cohen-type collateral orders into multi-
issue interlocutory appeal tickets." Id. at 1211. The panel majority
sought to avoid Swint by declaring that respondent's cross-appeal
was "inextricably intertwined" with the President's appeal. Pet.
App. 5 n.4. This conclusion is incorrect.

The question of whether the President is entitled, as a matter of
law, to defer this litigation is analytically distinct from the question
of whether a district court may exercise its discretion to stay all or
part of the litigation. The former question raises an issue of law, to
be decided based on the President's constitutional role and the
separation of powers principles we have discussed; the latter is a
discretionary determination to be made on the basis of the
particular facts of the case. Moreover, the legal question of whether
a President is entitled to defer litigation is one on which the district
court's determination is entitled to no special deference; a court's
exercise of discretion to stay proceedings is a determination that
can be overturned only for abuse of that discretion.

The district court, in deciding to postpone trial in this case,
explicitly invoked its discretionary powers over scheduling (Pet.
App. 71 (citing FED. R. CIV.P. 40 and "the equity powers of the
Court")), and based its decision not only on the defendant's status
as President^certainly a relevant and valid factor^but also on a
detailed discussion of the particular circumstances of this case:

This is not a case in which any necessity exists to rush to trial. It is
not a situation, for example, in which someone has been terribly
injured in an accident . . . and desperately needs to recover . . .
damages .... It is not a divorce action, or a child custody or child
support case, in which immediate personal needs of other parties
are at stake. Neither is this a case that would likely be tried with
few demands on Presidential time, such as an in rem foreclosure by
a lending institution.

The situation here is that the Plaintiff filed this action two days
before the three-year statute of limitations expired. Obviously,
Plaintiff Jones was in no rush to get her case to court ....
Consequently, the possibility that Ms. Jones may obtain a
judgment and damages in this matter does not appear to be of
urgent nature for her, and a delay in trial of the case will not harm
her right to recover or cause her undue inconvenience.

Pet. App. 70.

Review of the district court's discretionary decision to postpone the
trial^unlike review of its decision to reject the President's position
that the entire case should be deferred as a matter of law^must
address these particular facts of this case. Thus the respondent's
cross-appeal raised issues that, far from being "inextricably
intertwined" with the President's submission, can be resolved
separately from it. The panel majority's expansion of the court of
appeals' jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal was in error.

2. The decision to reverse the district court also was incorrect on
the merits. As Justice Cardozo explained for this Court in Landis v.
North Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248 (1936), a trial judge's decision to stay
proceedings should not be lightly overturned:

[T]he power to stay proceedings is incidental to the power inherent
in every court to control the disposition of the causes on its docket
.... How this can best be done calls for the exercise of judgment,
which must weigh competing interests and maintain an even
balance.

Id. at 254-55. Indeed, the Court in Landis specifically stated that

[e]specially in cases of extraordinary public moment, the [plaintiff]
may be required to submit to delay not immoderate in extent and
not oppressive in its consequences if the public welfare or
convenience will thereby be promoted.

Id. at 256.

The panel majority justified its reversal of the district court with a
single sentence in a footnote: "Such an order, delaying the trial
until Mr. Clinton is no longer President, is the functional
equivalent of a grant of temporary immunity to which, as we hold
today, Mr. Clinton is not constitutionally entitled." Pet. App. 13
n.9. It is unclear what the panel meant by labeling the district
court's order the "functional equivalent" of "temporary immunity",
inasmuch as the district court held that the litigation could go
forward through all steps short of trial. But it is entirely clear that
the panel majority, in its sweeping and conclusory ruling, did not
begin to conduct the kind of careful weighing of the particular facts
and circumstances that might warrant a conclusion that the trial
court here abused its discretion.

D. The Court Should Grant Review Now To Protect The Interests
Of The Presidency.

This is the only opportunity for the Court to review the President's
claim and grant adequate relief. If review is declined at this point,
the case will proceed in the trial court, and the interests the
President seeks to preserve by having the litigation
deferred^interests "rooted in the constitutional tradi-tion of the
separation of powers"^will be irretrievably lost. Fitzgerald, 457
U.S. at 743, 749. Should the President prevail on the merits below,
this Court will not even have the opportunity to provide guidance
for future cases.

Now, a court for the first time in history has held that a sitting
President is required to defend a private civil damages action. This
holding breaches historical understandings that are as appropriate
today as ever before./12 The court in Fitzgerald specifically
anticipated the threat posed by suits of this kind. Because of "the
sheer prominence of the President's office," the Court noted, the
President "would be an easily identifiable target for suits for civil
damages." 457 U.S. at 752-53. Chief Justice Burger added: "When
litigation processes are not tightly controlled . . . they can be and
are used as mechanisms of extortion. Ultimate vindication on the
merits does not repair the damage." Id. at 763 (concurring opinion).
In these circumstances, the fact that there is "no historical record of
numerous suits against the President"^as there was no comparable
record before Fitzgerald (id. at 753 n.33)^provides no reassurance
at all that this case will be an isolated one.

There is no question that the issues raised by this case will have
profound consequences for both the Presidency and the Judiciary.
The last word on issues of this importance should not be a decision
by a splintered panel of a court of appeals^a decision that is
inconsistent with the precedents of this Court and with the
constitutional tradition of separation of powers. The Court has
recognized that a "special solicitude [is] due to claims alleging a
threatened breach of essential Presidential prerogatives under the
separation of powers." Id. at 743. The Court should grant review
now, to protect those prerogatives.

Attorneys for the Petitioner
President William Jefferson Clinton

May 15, 1996



FN1 The first two counts allege that in 1991, when the President
was Governor of Arkansas and respondent a state employee, he
subjected respondent to sexual harassment and thereby deprived
her of her civil rights in violation of 42 U.S.C.   1983, 1985 (1994).
A third claim alleges that the President thereby inflicted emotional
distress upon respondent. Finally, the complaint alleges that in
1994, while he was President, petitioner defamed respondent
through statements attributed to the White House Press Secretary
and his lawyer, denying her much-publicized allegations against
the President. Arkansas State Trooper Danny Ferguson was named
as co-defendant in two counts. Respondent alleges that Trooper
Ferguson approached her on the President's behalf, thereby
conspiring with the President to deprive the respondent of her civil
rights in violation of 42 U.S.C.  1985. Respondent also alleges that
Mr. Ferguson defamed her in statements about a woman identified
only as "Paula," which were attributed to an anonymous trooper in
an article about President Clinton's personal conduct published in
The American Spectator magazine. Neither the publication nor the
author was named as a defendant in the suit.

FN2 The stay of trial encompassed the claims against Trooper
Ferguson as well, because the court found that there was "too much
interdepen-dency of events and testimony to proceed piecemeal,"
and that "it would not be possible to try the Trooper adequately
without testimony from the President." Pet. App. 71.

FN3 Jurisdiction for the President's appeal was founded on 28
U.S.C.  1291 (1994) and the collateral order doctrine, as articulated
in Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985) and Nixon v.
Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731, 743 (1982). In our view, however, the
court of appeals lacked jurisdiction to entertain respondent Jones'
cross-appeal. See infra pp. 16-19. The district court stayed the
litigation as to both defendants pending appellate review. Pet. App.
74.

FN4 The President reserved the right below to assert at the
appropriate time, along with certain common law immunities, the
defense of absolute immunity to thc defamation claim that arose
during his Presidency.

FN5 See, e.g., United States v. McDougal, No. LR-CR-95-173
(E.D. Ark. Mar. 20, 1996) (videotaped deposition at the White
House); United States v. Poindexter, 732 F. Supp. 142, 146-47
(D.D.C. 1990) (videotaped depo-sition); United States v. North,

New York 105 (1926), quoted in Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 763 n.6
(Burger, C.J., concurring).

FN7 For example. the panel majority declared that Article II "did
not create a monarchy" and that the President is "cloaked with
none of the attributes of sovereign immunity." Pet. App. 6.

FN8 Specifically,  a lawsuit against an activeduty service member
is to  be stayed unless it can be shown that the defendant's "ability .
. . to conduct his defense is not materially affected by reason of his
military service." 50 U.S.C. app. Section 521 (1988).

FN9 Indeed, a bankruptcy judge's discretion has been held
sufficient to authorize a stay of thirdparty litigation in other courts
that conceivably could have an effect on the bankruptcy estate,
even if the debtor is not a party to the litigation and the automatic
stay is not triggered. See 11 U.S.C. Section 105 (1994); 2
COLLIER ON BANKRUPtCY AT 105.02 (Lawrence P. King ed.,
15th ed. 1994), and cases cited therein.

FN10 See, e.g., Koester v. American Republic Invs., 11 F.3d 818,
823 (8th Cir. 1993); Wehling v. Columbia Broadcasting Sys., 608
F.2d 1084 (5th Cir. 1979); United States v. Mellon Bank N.A., 545
F.2d 869 (3d Cir. 1976).

FN11 Some courts recognize that exceptions may exist in cases in
which a stay is "tantamount to a dismissal" because it "effectively
ends the litigation." See, e.g., Boushel v. Toro Co., 985 F.2d 406,
408 (8th Cir. I993); Cheyney State College Faculty v. Hufstedler,
703 F.2d 732, 735 (3d Cir. 1983). Even assuming that this
exception should be allowed, it is not applicable here, where the
district court's order clearly contemplated further proceedings in
federal court. See Boushel, 985 F.2d at 408-09.

FN12 Heretofore, there have been no private civil damages suits
initiated or actively litigated while the defendant was serving as
President. While there are recorded private civil suits against
Theodore Roosevelt, Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy, all were
underway before the defendant assumed office. The first two were
dismissed by the time the defendant became President; after each
took office, the dismissal was confirmed on appeal. See New York
ex red Harley v. Roosevelt, 179 N.Y. 544 (1904); DeVault v.
Truman, 194 S.W.2d 29 (Mo. 1946). The Kennedy case was filed
while he was a candidate, and was settled after President
Kennedy's inauguration, without any discovery against the Chief
Executive. See, Bailey v. Kennedy, No. 757200, and Hills v.
Kennedy, No. 757201 (Los Angeles County Superior Court, both
filed Oct. 27, 1960).

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
WESTERN DIVISION

PAULA CORBIN JONES,  *
Plaintiff,   *

vs .    * No. LR-C-94-290

WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON *
and DANNY FERGUSON,  *

Defendants.   *

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER

 The Plaintiff, Paula Corbin Jones, filed a damage suit against
the Defendants William Jefferson Clinton and Danny Ferguson to
recover for acts which were alleged to have taken place
primarily while Defendant Clinton was Governor of Arkansas and
Defendant Ferguson was a Trooper with the Arkansas State Police
assigned to the Governor. Subsequently, in the General Election
of November, 1992, Mr. Clinton was elected President of the
United States and assumed that office on January 20, 1993.

 The complaint was filed on May 6, 1994, and was predicated on
an alleged incident which was said to have occurred on May 8,
1991. The action alleged sexual harassment and conspiracy
pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1983 and 1985, which are provisions
included in civil rights legislation of the reconstruction era.
It also alleged state law claims of defamation and outrage.

Defendant Ferguson responded to these allegations by, in
essence, denying any which might involve questionable activities
on his part. Defendant Clinton responded with a motion to
bifurcate the briefing schedule so as to permit the question of
Presidential immunity to be argued on a motion to dismiss before
any other questions were presented. On July 21, 1994, the Court
entered a Memorandum and Order allowing President Clinton to
file a motion to dismiss on the basis of Presidential immunity
and deferring and preserving the filing of any other motions or
pleadings until the issue of Presidential immunity had been
resolved. Jones v. Clinton, 858 F. Supp. 902 (E.D. Ark. 1994).
The Court noted that this order was purely procedural in nature
and addressed only the question of whether Presidential immunity
would be considered as a threshold issue. Id. at 907 n.6.

The basic issue, therefore, which this Memorandum Opinion and
Order addresses is whether a civil action may be asserted
against the President of the United States while he is in office
when the fact situation alleged in the complaint arose before
his election and assumption of office.

 I.

Absolute Immunity of the President from Civil Suit

 The President has asserted that he may not be sued in a civil
action while sitting as President, even when the facts asserted
by the Plaintiff occurred, if at all, before he was elected or
assumed the office. This, of course, is a claim of absolute
immunity. The President would have the Court dismiss the
complaint while preserving through some equitable tolling of the
statute of limitations the right of Ms. Jones to sue him civilly
as soon as he left office. The Justice Department in its
Statement of Interest of the United States also argued for
immunity, but urged the Court in the alternative simply to stay
the proceedings until the President had left office. Ms. Jones
argued against immunity, but also argued alternatively for
dismissal with an automatic reinstatement on the Court's docket
on the last day of his Presidency and against a stay. All briefs
discussed at some length the intent of the framers of the
Constitution and interpretations of various scholars and judges
relating to this subject, and all were thorough and well
researched.

A. The English Legacy

The Court believes that the place to begin this discussion,
before coming to the vital question of constitutional
interpretation, is in English law and the development of the
rights and liberties of the English people. The rights and
liberties of England became our inheritance. The Constitution of
the United States and the constitutions of the states contain
provisions that come directly from that source.

Almost all of the states adopted "reception statutes" receiving
into state law the English common law and acts of Parliament as
they existed as of a certain date--which was usually 1507, 1620,
or 1776--except to the extent that they were contrary to our
federal or state constitutions or statutes or were contrary to
our form of government. Arkansas adopted such a statute shortly
after becoming a state. Ark. Code Ann.  1-2-119 (Michie 1987);
Ark. Stat. Ann.  1-101 (1976 Repl.); discussed in Moore v.
Sharpe, 121 S.W. 341 (1909). The statute adopted the English
common law, subject to the stated limitations, as it existed
prior to the fourth year of James I. Various English statutes or
common law rules passed into Arkansas law as a result. E.g.
Biscoe v. Thweatt, 74 Ark. 545, 86 S.W. 432 (1905) (Statute of
Charitable Uses); Horsley v. Hilburn, 45 Ark. 458 (1884) (Rule
in Shelley's Case implicitly recognized but not applied to fee
tail pursuant to superseding Arkansas statute); Moody v. Walker,
3 Ark. 140 (1840) (Rule Against Perpetuities). Also received
were those portions of the Magna Carta relating to due process
of law, equal protection, trial by jury, and rights unrelated to
the feudal system.

The Magna Carta was largely a restatement of feudal law
pertaining to land tenures and their incidents, and thus most of
it has no application here. However, in addition to enshrining
in English law some of our basic rights and liberties, it
constituted a series of limitations placed upon the King and his
authority. There would follow in English history a long and
bloody struggle to define the rights of the monarchy as opposed
to Parliament and the citizenry and also to the common law
itself.

The tension between the King and Parliament, on the one hand,
and the King and the common law, on the other, reached its
heights with the ascension to the throne of the Stuart monarchy
in the person of King James the First (who was James the Sixth
of Scotland). Friction soon arose between the King and the House
of Commons. At the root of the disagreement, once again, was the
Magna Carta. See generally William Swindler, Magna Carta: Legend
and Legacy 169-176 (1965).

An important participant in all of this was Sir Edward Coke,
whose writings had an enormous influence on English and American
law, and who had served as Solicitor General and later Attorney
General under Queen Elizabeth I and also as Chief Justice of the
Court of Common Pleas. He subsequently would become Chief
Justice of the King's Bench under King James I. See 3 Roscoe
Pound, Jurisprudence 428 (1959). Under Elizabeth, as her
attorney, Coke had been a staunch defender of the Crown, but as
a judge, he would quote Bracton to King James: "The King ought
to be under no man, but under God and the law." Swindler, supra,
at 172. He also stated in Dr. Bonham's Case, 8 Co. 113b, 118a,
77 Eng. Rep. 646, 652 (1610): "And it appears in our bodies,
that in many cases the common law will controul acts of
Parliament, and sometimes adjudge them to be utterly void" if
they are "against common right and reason." William B. Lockhart
et al., The American Constitution 251 (5th ed. 1981). That was
unlikely to be a true statement of the law in the early 17th
Century, but to the extent that it was precedent, it may be said
to be an early expression of judicial review.

None of this and other frictions set well with the King, and
Coke was dismissed from the bench, turning his efforts to
Parliament. The continuing friction between Parliament and
James' successor, King Charles I, ultimately led to the adoption
of the Petition of Right, which in essence ratified and extended
the Magna Carta, and in effect further limited the prerogatives
of the Crown. A defining moment came when the House of Commons
rejected a proposal of the House of Lords that would add a
clause recognizing the sovereignty of the King. Coke gave this
fulmination:

 I know that prerogative is part of the law, but sovereign power
is no Parliamentary word; in my opinion, it weakens Magna Carta
and all our statutes; for they are absolute without any saving
of sovereign power. And shall we now add to it, we shall weaken
the foundation of law, and then the building must needs fall;
take we heed what we yield unto--Magna Carta is such a Fellow,
he will have no Sovereign.

Swindler, supra, at 185.

 The Petition of Right was one of the foundation stones of the
English Constitution. It enlarged upon the Magna Carta as a
constitutional limitation upon the power of the monarchy. It
made it apparent that the King's prerogative was limited. Sub
Deo et Lege FN 1 was the law of the land.

B. The American Experience

 In the formulation of Article II of the Constitution, there
were varying viewpoints as to the office of the President. FN 2
Some, such as Roger Sherman of Connecticut, believed that the
President should be "nothing more than an instrument for
carrying the will of the Legislature into effect," while others,
such as Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania, thought the President
should be "the guardian of the people, even of the lower
classes, against Legislative tyranny." Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.,
The Constitution: Article II, in An American Primer 121-22
(Daniel J. Boorstin ed., 1968). What resulted was the compromise
that we have today, amended only slightly from the original. It
sets out the powers and duties of the Executive Branch (i.e.,
the President and the administrators he appoints), but it does
not address the immunity question.

A large part of the problem, aside from the silence of the
Constitution, is that for all practical purposes, the Executive
Branch, unlike the Congress and the Supreme Court, consists of
only one person. His administrative appointees serve at his
pleasure. Thus, a large part of the President's assertion may be
summarized in the proposition that, without immunity, to cripple
the Presidency in one way or another in civil litigation is to
deliver a blow to and weaken the effectiveness of the entire
Executive Branch of government which in effect is only one
person, the President.

The importance of unimpeded, independent branches of government
is discussed by Alexander Hamilton FN 3 in The Federalist No.
51:

Were the executive, magistrate, or the judges not independent of
the legislature in this particular, their independence in every
other would be merely nominal. . . [We must give] to those who
administer every department the necessary constitutional means
and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others. . .
constitutional rights of the place. It may be a reflection on
human nature that such devices should be necessary to control
the abuses of government. But what is government itself but the
greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels,
no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men,
neither external nor internal controls on government would be
necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered
by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must
first enable the government to control the governed; and in the
next place oblige it to control itself.

I The People Shall Judge 312, 313 (University of Chicago Social
Science Staff 1949). He is speaking of independence from other
branches, but also of the responsibility that goes along with
it.

The President and his lawyers, in arguing the immunity issue,
seem to place substantial reliance on the intention of the
framers of the Constitution. Much of what they argue relates to
the impeachment process. For example, they seize in their brief
upon this commentary by Hamilton from The Federalist No. 69:
"The President of the United States would be liable to be
impeached, tried, and, upon conviction of treason, bribery, or
other high crimes or misdemeanors, removed from office; and
would afterwards be liable to prosecution and punishment in the
ordinary course of the law." Of course, Hamilton was talking
about impeachment under Article II, Section 4, under which the
President may be "removed from Office on Impeachment for, and
Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and
Misdemeanors." That has nothing to do with immunity from civil
suit. Article II, and Hamilton, were addressing criminal conduct
on the part of the President.

This is not to say, however, that the question of Presidential
immunity from suit was not discussed at the Constitutional
Convention or during the years immediately following. Justice
Lewis Powell addresses this in speaking for the majority of the
Court in Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731 (1982):

[T]here is historical evidence from which it may be inferred
that the Framers assumed the President's immunity from damages
liability. At the Constitutional Convention several delegates
expressed concern that subjecting the President even to
impeachment would impair his capacity to perform his duties of
office. See 2 M. Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention of
1787, p. 64 (1911) (remarks of Gouverneur Morris); id., at 66
(remarks of Charles Pinckney). The delegates of course did agree
to an Impeachment Clause. But nothing in their debates suggests
an expectation that the President would be subjected to the
distraction of suits by disappointed private citizens. And
Senator Maclay has recorded the views of Senator Ellsworth and
Vice President John Adams--both delegates to the Convention-
-that `the President, personally, was not the subject to any
process whatever . . . . For [that] would . . . put it in the
power of a common justice to exercise any authority over him and
stop the whole machine of Government.' Journal of William Maclay
167 (E. Maclay ed. 1890).

457 U.S. at 751-52 n.31.

Justice Powell also quoted from Justice Joseph Story's
Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States to this
effect:

`There are . . . incidental powers, belonging to the executive
department, which are necessarily implied from the nature of the
functions, which are confided to it. Among these, must
necessarily be included the power to perform them . . . The
president cannot, therefore, be liable to arrest, imprisonment,
or detention, while he is in the discharge of the duties of his
office; and for this purpose his person must be deemed, in civil
cases at least, to possess an official inviolability.' 3 J.
Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States
Sec. 1563, pp. 418-419 (1st ed. 1833).

457 U.S. at 750.

But just as the English law moved from the divine right of kings
assertion to the assertion of Lord Coke and Parliament that the
King was under God and the law, the situation in American law
prior to Fitzgerald had proceeded essentially in the same
direction with regard to the office of President. For example,
it has been pointed out that when Hamilton made the statement
quoted previously from The Federalist No. 69, "he was referring
to his own plan" rather than reciting faithfully what had been
proposed. Raoul Berger, Selected Writings on the Constitution
46-47 n.94 (1987). Moreover, the discussion at the
Constitutional Convention revolved around the impeachment
process, the basis for which was the commission of "high crimes
and misdemeanors." Although Justice Story, writing several
decades later, discusses civil cases, as previously quoted, he
is writing from the perspective of someone who was a boy at the
time of the Convention--although admittedly he was rather close
in time to those proceedings. He was successful in that what he
wrote was embodied in Fitzgerald. There was much opposition even
to the impeachment provision; some thought that the Supreme
Court should conduct the trial rather than the Senate. James
Madison was an advocate of that view, although Gouverneur Morris
thought that "no other tribunal than the Senate could be
trusted" and believed that the Supreme Court "were too few in
number and might be warped or corrupted." 2 Debates in the
Federal Convention of 1787 Which Framed the Constitution of the
United States of America 535 (reported by James Madison)
(Gaillard Hunt & James Brown Scott, eds., 1987).

The disagreement over Presidential immunity at the
Constitutional Convention carried over into the years that
followed. In United States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 30 (C.C.D. Va.
1807) (No. 14,692d), Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that a
subpoena duces tecum could be issued to President Thomas
Jefferson. Jefferson protested strongly, arguing that the three
branches of government had to be independent of each other,
including independence by the executive from the judiciary.
(Discussed in Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. at 751 n. 31.) In
Livingston v. Jefferson, 15 F.Cas. 660 (C.C.D. Va. 1811) (No.
8,411), damages were sought for alleged trespass committed by a
federal officer at the direction of Jefferson, but a federal
court dismissed it for having been brought improperly in
Virginia. The immunity issue was not reached. Of course, even
before these cases, the argument of total independence of the
Executive Branch from judicial action had been settled in large
part by Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803). This
case is remembered for the recognition and use of judicial
review in the Supreme Court of an Act of Congress, but it also
directed by mandamus that Secretary of State James Madison
deliver Marbury's justice of the peace commission to him
contrary to the desires of President Jefferson. While not
bearing upon the immunity question directly, it was apparent
that the Executive Branch was not immune from action by the
Judicial Branch in enforcing mandates of the Constitution. In
fact, Chief Justice Marshall said of Marbury's rights and
remedies: "The very essence of civil liberty certainly consists
in the right of every individual to claim the protection of the
laws, whenever he receives an injury." 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) at 163.

However, in Mississippi v. Johnson, 71 U.S. 475 (1867), the
Supreme Court refused to enjoin President Andrew Johnson from
enforcing the Reconstruction Acts. Chief Justice Salmon P.
Chase, writing for a unanimous Court, declined to enjoin
enforcement of the legislation even though it was allegedly
unconstitutional. He distinguished Marbury by stating that it
only related to ministerial duties involving no discretion while
these Acts related to "executive and political" duties involving
broad discretion. To enjoin the President would be to restrain
him from carrying out his constitutional responsibility to
execute the laws. Enjoining him would threaten the separation of
powers between the branches and the independence of the
President. See similarly, Kendall v. United States, 37 U.S. 524,
610 (1838), and National Treasury Employees Union v. Nixon, 492
F.2d 587, 608-612 (D.C. Cir. 1974).

Of course, the complaint of Paula Corbin Jones in this civil
case relates neither to the ministerial nor the executive duties
of the President. The allegations relate to alleged conduct of
the President while he was Governor of Arkansas. (The
allegations, it might be noted, also do not relate to any
ministerial or executive duty of the Office of Governor.) The
Justice Department, in its brief, stated that it knew of only
three private suits based on pre-presidential conduct which had
been adjudicated during the President's term in office. These
three were (1) an action against Theodore Roosevelt and the
Board of Police in New York City, which was resolved in the
Board's favor in 1904, People ex rel. Hurley v. Roosevelt, 179
N.Y. 544 (1904); (2) A damage suit against Harry Truman based
upon his conduct as a county judge in 1931, resolved in Truman's
favor in 1946, Devault v. Truman, 194 S.W. 2d 29 (Mo. 1946); and
(3) a suit against John F. Kennedy in California Superior Court
asserting a tort claim from an automobile accident occurring
during the 1960 campaign, which was ultimately settled, Bailey
v. Kennedy, No. 757,200 (Cal. Super. Ct. 1962).

However, the case most applicable to this one is Nixon v.
Fitzgerald, cited previously. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme
Court decided that President Nixon had absolute immunity from a
suit brought by A. Ernest Fitzgerald, a management analyst with
the Department of the Air Force, whom the President ordered
fired because he had given congressional testimony on cost
overruns which embarrassed his superiors in the Department of
Defense (and presumably embarrassed the President also).
Fitzgerald sued for damages. The district court rejected
President Nixon's assertion of Presidential immunity. The court
of appeals affirmed, but the Supreme Court reversed, holding
that the President had absolute immunity from a civil suit for
damages resulting from official actions taken by the President
while in office. The majority opinion of Justice Lewis Powell
was hotly disputed in a dissent by Justice Byron White, in which
Justices Blackmun, Brennan and Marshall joined. The majority
opinion was in accord with the view of the scholar, Edward S.
Corwin, in discussing the President's immunity from judicial
process. Edward S. Corwin, The President: Office and Powers 138
(3d ed. 1948).

But the facts of Fitzgerald, as stated previously, are not the
same as those in this case. Mr. Nixon was President when he
fired Mr. Fitzgerald and was acting in his capacity as the head
of the Executive Branch. Mr. Clinton was not President and was
not even the President-elect when the alleged cause of action
arose in this case.

The Constitution, of course, is silent on all of this. The
framers debated even the subject of whether the President should
be subject to impeachment for criminal acts and, if so, who
should conduct the trial. There is nothing in the document
relating to civil actions. Justice Story, supra, was of the mind
that the President possessed immunity from civil suit, and the
Supreme Court in Fitzgerald agreed in a severely divided opinion
that the President was civilly immune from suits brought for
official actions taken while in office.

Thus, the hard fact is that these issues of immunity, whether
absolute or qualified, have been left in the hands of the
Judicial Branch, particularly the Supreme Court. This District
Court is not activist in nature and is not inclined to "make
law" where none exists. As stated by Chief Justice John Marshall
in Marbury v. Madison, however: "It is emphatically the province
and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is." 5
U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177 (1803).

This Court recognizes the reasoning of Justice Powell and his
thin majority in Nixon v. Fitzgerald that the President has
absolute immunity from civil damage actions arising out of the
execution of official duties of office. However, this Court does
not believe that a President has absolute immunity from civil
causes of action arising prior to assuming the office. Nowhere
in the Constitution, congressional acts, or the writings of any
judge or scholar, may any credible support for such a
proposition be found. It is contrary to our form of government,
which asserts as did the English in the Magna Carta and the
Petition of Right, that even the sovereign is subject to God and
the law.

Therefore, the President's Motion to Dismiss on Grounds of
Presidential Immunity is denied.

Limited or Temporary Immunity from Trial

The question does not end here, however, because the intent of
the Supreme Court in Nixon v. Fitzgerald would seem to carry
this case beyond the question of absolute immunity from civil
suit. The language of the majority opinion by Justice Powell is
sweeping and quite firm in the view that to disturb the
President with defending civil litigation that does not demand
immediate attention under the circumstances would be to
interfere with the conduct of the duties of the office.

Justice Powell states unequivocally the following: "Because of
the singular importance of the President's duties, diversion of
his energies by concern with private lawsuits would raise unique
risks to the effective functioning of government." 457 U.S. at
751. He adds:

In view of the visibility of his office and the effect of his
actions on countless people, the President would be an easily
identifiable target for suits for civil damages. Cognizance of
this personal vulnerability frequently could distract a
President from his public duties, to the detriment of not only
the President and his office but also the Nation that the
Presidency was designed to serve. 457 U.S. at 754.

Chief Justice Burger expressed the same theme in his concurring
opinion: "Exposing a President to civil damages actions for
official acts within the scope of the Executive authority would
inevitably subject Presidential actions to undue judicial
scrutiny as well as subject the President to harassment." 457
U.S. at 762.

Of course, in the preceding part of this opinion, this Court has
pointed out that President Clinton's alleged acts took place
before he was President and that he was not acting in the scope
of Executive authority. Nonetheless, the concerns expressed by a
majority of the Supreme Court are not lessened by the fact that
these alleged actions preceded his Presidency, nor by the fact
that his alleged actions would not have been within his official
governmental capacity anyway. The problem, still, is essentially
the same--the necessity to avoid litigation, which also might
blossom through other unrelated civil actions, and which could
conceivably hamper the President in conducting the duties of his
office. This situation, as stated by Justice Powell in one of
the preceding quotations from Nixon v. Fitzgerald, could have
harmful effects in connection not only with the President but
also with the nation in general.

It is therefore the view of this Court that although President
Clinton is not entitled to have this action dismissed on the
basis of immunity, he should not have to devote his time and
effort to the defense of this case at trial while in office.

This is not a case in which any necessity exists to rush to
trial. It is not a situation, for example, in which someone has
been terribly injured in an accident through the alleged
negligence of the President and desperately needs to recover
such damages as may be awarded by a jury. It is not a divorce
action, or a child custody or child support case, in which
immediate personal needs of other parties are at stake. Neither
is this a case that would likely be tried with few demands on
Presidential time, such as an in rem foreclosure by a lending
institution.

The situation here is that the Plaintiff filed this action two
days before the three-year statute of limitations expired.
Obviously, Plaintiff Jones was in no rush to get her case to
court and, in fact, has stated publicly and in her brief that
her lawsuit came about in an effort to clear her name of
allegations of sexual activity involving then-Governor Clinton.
Her complaint, in paras. 41-47, discusses in detail this
situation and indicates that suit was brought because of the use
of the name "Paula" in an article appearing in The American
Spectator, in which the author purportedly obtained his
information from state troopers, including Defendant Ferguson.
Consequently, the possibility that Ms. Jones may obtain a
judgment and damages in this matter does not appear to be of
urgent nature for her, and a delay in trial of the case will not
harm her right to recover or cause her undue inconvenience. For
want of better phraseology, this amounts to the granting of
temporary or limited immunity from trial as Fitzgerald seems to
require due to the fact that the primary defendant is the
President. The court believes that such ruling is also permitted
under Rule 40 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allowing
district courts to place matters upon the trial calendar "as the
courts deem expedient." Further, such limited immunity from
trial would seem to be justified under the equity powers of the
Court.

By putting the case on hold, as far as trial is concerned, the
Court avoids any tolling of the statute of limitations problems
which might otherwise be presented if the case were dismissed
without prejudice. Despite the fact that the President considers
himself estopped to object to a refiling, the Court believes
that a delay of the trial is the better way to proceed.

This does not mean, however, that the case is put on the shelf
for all purposes. There would seem to be no reason why the
discovery and deposition process could not proceed as to all
persons including the President himself. This approach
eliminates the problem that witnesses may die, disappear, become
incapacitated, or become forgetful due to the passage of time.

Because there is too much interdependency of events and
testimony to proceed piecemeal, the allegations against the
trooper will be tried at the same time as those against the
President. His case is integrally related to the allegations
against the President; both cases arose out of the same alleged
incident; and while the suit against the Trooper has unrelated
matters based upon his alleged actions and statements subsequent
to the alleged incident, it would not be possible to try the
Trooper adequately without testimony from the President.

III.

Conclusion

The Court has attempted to follow its understanding of Nixon v.
Fitzgerald and other cases as well as to adhere to the
historical framework involved. Most importantly, the Court has
sought to give effect to the full meaning of the separation of
powers doctrine originally enunciated by Montesquieu and
implicit in the founding fathers' structure of the Constitution.
Essential Presidential prerogatives are "rooted in the
separation of powers under the Constitution." United States v.
Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 708 (1974).

On the other hand, in situations in which the President was not
the holder of his office when the action allegedly arose, there
would seem to be no immunity against civil litigation. The
rights of Plaintiff Jones as an American citizen must be
protected. Sub Deo et lege is our law as well as the law of
Great Britain. No one, be he King or President, is above the
law.

To protect the Office of President, however, from the potential
harm that could result from unfettered civil litigation, and to
give effect to the policy of separation of powers, it is
necessary to provide that the President cannot be tried in the
context presented here until he leaves office. President
Clinton's term in office, if he is re-elected in 1996, would end
no later than January 20, 2001. An earlier termination might
come on January 20, 1997, which is only slightly over two years
away. By permitting discovery as to all including the President,
the Court is laying the groundwork for a trial shortly after the
President leaves office.

In granting limited or temporary immunity from immediate trial
to President Clinton, the Court wishes to emphasize that it
holds no brief for alleged sexual harassment, a matter of
important concern to many people. The importance of such issue
is another reason why there should be no absolute immunity in
this case, but only a temporary Presidential immunity from
trial.

Finally, the Court must express its awareness that this case is
one in which new law is being made. All of the references to
historical events and to other cases do not change that fact. In
making such a ruling, the Court is also not unmindful of the
fact that to this extent the separation of powers has been
breached. But it has happened before in many cases including
United States v. Nixon, supra, and many of the landmark
decisions of Chief Justice John Marshall. In the end, the
decision must be made by the courts when there is doubt and only
limited precedent.

As previously noted, it "is emphatically the province and duty
of the judicial department to say what the law is." Marbury, 5
U.S. (1 Cranch) at 177. United States v. Nixon reaffirmed that
statement: "We therefore reaffirm that it is the province and
duty of this Court `to say what the law is' with respect to the
claim of privilege presented in this case." 418 U.S. at 707.
That is what this Court has tried to do, keeping in mind the
words of Chief Justice John Marshall that "we must never forget
that it is a constitution we are expounding." McCulloch v.
Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheaton) 316, 407 (1819), FN 4 and that it
is intended to endure for generations and to be applied to the
various crises of human affairs.

The President's motion seeking immunity from suit is denied. The
court will issue a scheduling order in due course.

IT IS SO ORDERED this 28th day of December 1994.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE



FN 1 In Prohibitions Del Roy, 77 Eng. Rep. 1342,1343, 12 Co.Rep.
64, 65 (K.B. 1608). Lord Coke wrote:

[B]ut His Majesty was not learned in the law of his realm of
England, and causes which concern the life, or inheritance, or
goods, or fortunes of his subjects, are not to be decided by
natural reason but by the artificial reason and Judgment of law,
which law is an act which requires long study and experience,
before that a man can attain to the cognizance of it: that the
law was the golden met-wand and measure to try the causes of the
subjects; and which protected His Majesty in safety and peace:
with which the King was greatly offended, and said, that then he
should be under the law, which was treason to affirm, as he
said; to which I said, that Bracton saith, Quod Rex non debet
esse sub homine, sed sub Deo et lege. [That the King ought not
to be under any man. but under God and the law.]

quoted in DAVID MELLINKOFF, THE LANGUAGE OF THE LAW 203 (1963).

 In Catherine Drinker Bowen's book, The Lion and The Throne, the
situation which led to this opinion is discussed in some detail.
The events of this period in English legal and political history
were conclusive in determining the end of "the divine right of
Kings" and subjecting the King to the law. This is historically
important to us in that the the founding fathers cast very
little light (outside of the impeachment provision) upon suits
against the President, and this matter was never addressed by
Congress in passing laws enacted pursuant to the Constitution.
It must be assumed that the rights of the President do not rise
above the rights of an English monarch in the early 17th
Century.

Despite these statements by Lord Coke that the King was subject
to the law, there existed contemporaneously in England the rule
that "the King can do no wrong," a relic presumably rooted in
the divine right of Kings. Blackstone expressed it this way:

Besides the attribute of sovereignty, the law also ascribes to
the King, in his political capacity, absolute perfection. The
King can do no wrong: which ancient and fundamental maxim is not
to be understood, as if every thing transacted by the government
was of course just and lawful. but means only two things. First.
that whatever is exceptionable in the conduct of public affairs,
is not to be imputed to the King. nor is he answerable for it
personally to his people; for this doctrine would totally
destroy that constitutional independence of the crown which is
necessary for the balance of power in our free and active, and
therefore compounded, constitution. And, secondly, it means that
the prerogative of the crown extends not to do any injury; it is
created for the benefit of the people. and therefore cannot be
exerted to their prejudice.

The King, moreover, is not only incapable of doing wrong, but
even of thinking wrong: he can never mean to do an improper
thing; in him is no folly or weakness. WILLIAM BLACKSTONE,
COMMENTARIES ON THE LAWS OF ENGLAND 6 (Chitty ed. 1855)
(emphasis in the original). Of course, when Blackstone
published his Commentaries this idea was already ludicrous in
the light of the history of the English monarchy. A litany of
the wrongs, weaknesses and sins of English kings would establish
that they were not only capable of "doing wrong" but also of
"thinking wrong" and were replete with folly and weakness.

The English concept of kingship never entered into the law of
the United States, although in England it apparently exists
today to give the Queen an absolute immunity from being sued for
personal torts in the civil courts." R. J. Gray, Private Wrongs
of Public Servants, 47 CAL. L. REV. 303, 307 (1959). See also
Mayer G. Freed, Executive Official Immunity for Constitutional
Violations: An Analysis and a Critique, 72 NW U. L. REV. 56
(1977).

United States did not adopt through the reception statutes those
aspects of English law relating to the monarchy since kings and
queens are contrary to our form of government. Thus what remains
of our English heritage on this point are the basic documents of
English liberties--the Magna Carta, the Petition of Right,
Habeas Corpus, and the English Bill of Rights.

Moreover, as Chief Justice John Marshall pointed out in Marbury
v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 163 (1803). the King is
subject to being "sued" in the form of a petition "and he never
fails to comply with the judgment of his court."

 FN 2 Russell Kirk cites Sir Henry Maine for the proposition
that "the office of the President really is the office of a
King--the chief difference being that the American President is
subject to election. at fixed terms, and that the office is not
hereditary." He adds: "Maine even suggests that the framers of
the Constitution may have had in mind the powers of George III
when they established the powers of the American presidency." He
continues in that vein discussing how powerful an office it is.
He adds, however, that the restraint exercised by the first six
presidents prevented the reduction of the legislative and
judicial branches to insignificance. RUSSELL KIRK, THE ROOTS OF
AMERICAN ORDER 427-428 (1974). This seems to be an exaggeration,
however, since during that period of time, the opinions of Chief
Justice John Marshall sufficed to prevent the Executive Branch
from subverting the Judicial Branch, although the first six
presidents did exercise substantial restraint, particularly
Washington and Adams. It seems much more likely that in
providing for the Executive Branch, the founders did not have
George III in mind at all, except in an unfavorable sense. The
"George" that they likely had in mind was George Washington. The
Executive Branch was probably modeled for the first man to
occupy it--which may explain why even the insertion of an
impeachment provision for criminal offenses was a matter of
debate.

FN 3 Some attribute this paper to James Madison. In I THE PEOPLE
SHALL JUDGE 312 (University of Chicago Social Science Staff
1949) its author is listed "Hamilton or Madison."

 FN 4 As explained by Judge Robert H. Bork, Chief Justice
Marshall was pointing out that "there are differences in the way
we deal with different legal materials . . . By this [Chief
Justice Marshall] meant that narrow, legalistic reasoning was
not to be applied to the document's broad provisions, a document
that could not, by its nature and uses, `partake of the
prolixity of a legal code.' " ROBERT H. BORK, THE TEMPTING OF
AMERICA 145 (1990).

<P>An excerpt from a manuscript for "Hell Hath No Fury" by Joan Collins.</P>
<HR WIDTH=525 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>Chapter 5</B></P>

<P>Pauline stuck a Camel in her mouth, fired it up with a click of her gold-and-onyx lighter, and with the cigarette glued to her lower lip while squinting one eye against the rising swirl of smoke, lost no time in introducing each of the three men.</P>

<P>"This is Mr. Balfour from Garrard's, the Crown jewellers."</P>

<P>"How do you do, Miss Marlowe." Mr. Balfour stepped forward and gave Laura a slight bow.</P>

<P>Mentally she summed him up in one experienced actor's glance. He was a tall and trim stately gentlemen from the old school. Splendidly turned out in a worsted black suit from Huntsman of Saville Row, a gray silk shirt with a starched white collar, and matching gray silk tie, one could easily have mistaken him for a senior merchant banker from the City, especially with the hand-stitched attach case he was carrying.</P>

<P>Laura smiled. "How do you do, Mr. Balfour? she replied softly.</P>

<P>"Very well, thank you madam." His mannerisms were deliberately unhurried and deceptively servile. "Hopefully, the same can be said for you."</P>

<P>"And this," Pauline continued, indicating the largest of the three men, "is Mr. Earl. He's your security guard, and he'll shadow you until the jewels are returned all in one piece."</P>

<P>Laura smiled charmingly at the beefy young guard, whose massive shoulders and biceps threatened to split the seams of his rented dinner jacket.</P>

<P>" 'Ello, Miss," he said, politely touching his forehead with a finger in a kind of salute. "It's a right 'onor. 'Course, my old mum an' I, we seen all yer pictures. She's a great fan 'o yers, is me mum"</P>

<P>"I'm glad to hear that," smiled Laura.</P>

<P>Pauline coughed impatiently. "And this," she rasped as a rebuke to hurry things up, "is Mr. Cooney, the protocol officer from the U.S. Embassy."</P>

<P>"Miss Marlowe." The third man stepped forward, his prominent  Adam's apple bobbing.</P>

<P>Laura nodded at him. "How do you do, Mr. Cooney?"</P>

<P>He was the last person on earth she would have imagined occupying such a position. A thin fluttery bureaucrat, he seemed uncomfortable, fidgety - and a dead ringer for Norman Bates.</P>

<P>"Well?" Pauline demanded, glancing at her diamond-studded wristwatch. "How about we get the show on the road? We've got one hour before we have to be at the theater, and Laura still hasn't put in an appearance out there."</P>

<P>She indicated the door behind her with a jerk of her head, crossed over to the nearest ashtray, stubbed out her cigarette, and immediately lit another. She carried the ashtray over to the bed, where she lounged back on the quilted silk spread, keeping an eye on things while relentlessly smoking a chain of Camels.</P>

<P>"May I?" Scrupulously polite, Mr. Balfour gestured at the ottoman next to the tabouret on which Laura was perched.</P>

<P>"Of course." She nodded.</P>

<P>He laid his mahogany leather attach case down on it and then, as though partaking in some obscure religious ritual, ceremoniously unlocked the case, undid both brass turnlock closures, and slowly raised the lid.</P>

<P>One by one, he lifted out three midnight-blue velvet cases of varying sizes and lined them up on the dressing table.</P>

<P>He opened the largest one first.</P>

<P>Laura clapped her gloved hands to her mouth. "My God!" she gasped, her eyes huge as saucers.</P>

<P>She was so mesmerized, nothing else seemed to exist and she was suddenly deaf to all sounds. The entire world was reduced to nothing more than the dazzling treasure spread out in a crescent against its nest of black velvet.</P>

<P>It was a necklace, a breathtakingly magnificent necklace composed of seven pigeon-blood rubies, each surrounded by diamonds of various graduated sizes.</P>

<P>Reverently, Mr. Balfour lifted the necklace out of the case by its ends.</P>

<P>"All seven of the rubies are Burmese, perfectly matched and flawless," he pointed out. "They weigh exactly twenty-eight point three carats each. As for the diamonds, they are, I must admit, of the old-fashioned mine cut, but they are a beautiful make."</P>

<P>He saw her slight frown and smiled.</P>

<P>"That madam," he explained, "is industry jargon for proportion, finish, polish and the symmetry of the facets. In other words, each stone is clear white and flawless. I might mention that there are two hundred and fourteen individual diamonds in all, ranging in size from one quarter of a carat to three-and-a-half. Excluding the rubies, the total carat weight of the diamonds comes to three hundred and thirty-two."</P>

<P>Laura slowly lowered her hands. When she spoke, her voice was hushed. "Do you mind my asking what this is worth?'</P>

<P>Mr. Balfour smiled. "Considering the provenance, it's actually priceless. Now then. If you'll permit me, madam?"</P>

      statements, notices, directions and other instruments

      others involving said rights and to pay over promptly

      advance payment upon acceptance of said one-half 
      manuscript, and the Publisher will be required to pay 
      the entire remaining portion of the $2,000,000.00 
      advance for Work #1. The Publisher shall do so in 
      accordance with the schedule set forth in Paragraph 30 
      or 31 below as appropriate.

   b. Subject to Paragraph 28, if the Author delivers one-
      half the manuscript of Work #2 in a timely manner and 
      if the Publisher accepts said one-half manuscript, 
      then the Publisher shall pay $500,000.00 of the total 
      advance payment upon acceptance of said one-half 
      manuscript, and the Publisher will be required to pay 
      the entire remaining portion of the $2,000,000.00 
      advance for Work #2. The Publisher shall do so in 
      accordance with the schedule set forth in Paragraph 30 
      or 31 below as appropriate.

30.a. If the Author delivers the complete manuscript of Work 
      01 in a timely manner and if in the opinion of the 
      Publisher's legal counsel Work #1 does not violate the

      is earlier; $500,000.00 on publication of the 
      paperback edition of Work #1 but no earlier than one 
      year after publication of the hardcover edition of

      #2 in a timely manner and if in the opinion of the

      privacy of any person or contain libelous or obscene 
      matter and if the Publisher publishes Work #2 then the 
      balance of the advance for Work #2 shall be paid as 
      follows: $500,000.00 on publication of the hardcover 
      edition of Work #2 or within 12 months of acceptance

      manuscript; and $500,000.00 two years after delivery 
      of the manuscript. Payment of the entire advance

      publish Work #2.

32. Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph 28.a.iv. or 
28.b.iv., and 30 and/or 31, if in the opinion of the 
Publisher's legal counsel Work #1 or Work #2 may violate the

have 30 business days to alter said work in conformity with 
the Publisher's requests and/or provide documentation 
satisfactory to the Publisher of the passages Publisher has 
questioned.

33. In the case of each Work, until the entire advance paid

British rights and 20% in the case of translation rights) 
received by or for the Author from the sale, licensing or 
other exploitation of first serial, British and translation 
rights (including option payments) in such work shall be 
paid to the Publisher within thirty (30) days after such 
receipt by the Author and applied against said advance. The

publication rights in Work 01 to Random Century for an 
advance of $1,500,000.00. Upon the Publisher's receipt of 
any of such money pursuant to Paragraph 33 above, the 
Publisher shall apply the first $750,000.00 (minus the 
agent's commission of up to $112,500.00) against the 
unearned advance for Work #1. The Publisher will deposit the 
second $750,000.00 (minus agency commission) in an interest-
bearing account.

In the event that this agreement is terminated as to Work #1 
because one-half of the manuscript of Work #1 is not 
satisfactory to the Publisher, the Publisher will repay 
forthwith to the Author any portions of the Random Century 
advance it has received.

In the event that the Publisher accepts the first half of 
the manuscript of Work #2, the Publisher will remove any 
portions of the Random Century advance held in the 
interestbearing account and apply said sums (less interest) 
against the unearned advance for Work #2. The Publisher will 
withdraw and remit to the Author any interest that has 
accrued on such amounts upon the Author's written request 
(less 10% agency commission, which shall be paid to the 
agent simultaneously). In the event that this agreement is 
terminated as to Work #2, any moneys in the interest-bearing 
account shall be removed and repaid to the Author.

The author agrees that no more than $112,500.00 of Irving 
Paul Lazar Agency commissions due on the $1,500,000.00 
Random Century advance will be deducted from the first 
$750,000.00 paid by Random Century.

35. The Author represents that he has sold British 
publication rights in Work #2 for an advance of $600,000.00. 
All monies received by the Publisher pursuant to Paragraph 
33 from the licensing of rights in Work #2 shall be applied 
only against the unearned advance for Work #2.

36. In the case of each Work, no royalties shall be paid 
until the entire advances paid and payable pursuant to 
Paragraph 9, 27, 29, 30 and 31 for said Work have been 
recouped by the Publisher.

37. All audio and video rights are expressly reserved by the 
Author.

38. Upon termination of this agreement all rights shall 
revert to the Author subject to any licenses previously 
granted and subject to the Publisher's right to dispose of 
any copies previously printed.

39. It is understood and agreed that Work #1 shall be 
jointly edited by Joni Evans or her designee in the United 
States and by Rosie Cheetham or her designee in the United

40. In respect of the hardcover edition of the work, the 
Author shall have approval, not to be unreasonably withheld, 
of jacket and cover design, text and copy, title of the 
work, and of all photographs, biographic material and 
likeness used on the jacket or cover or used for publicity 
or advertising.

41. Any and all consents or approvals required of the Author

travel outside Joan Collins' area of residence, and for all 
meal and transportation expenses in connection with the

advances and royalties due pursuant to this agreement shall 
be paid in accordance with Paragraph 44 above. The Author's 
Agent's ten percent (10%) commission with respect to the 
$2,000,000.00 advance payable hereunder with respect to each 
Work shall be paid as follows: $50,000.00 upon the Author's 
Agent's written request; and $150,000.00 upon acceptance of 
one-half the manuscript. The Irving Paul Lazar Agency 
acknowledges that such payments of the agent's commission 
constitute a portion of the total advance to the Author for

made to the Author from the disposition of British 
Commonwealth rights and twenty percent (20%) as an agency 
coupled with an interest out of all gross payments made to 
the Author from the disposition of foreign translation

AGREED WITH RESPECT TO PARAGRAPH 45:

THE IRVING PAUL LAZAR AGENCY

By: Insurance Rider To Publishing Agreement

Dated Between Gemini Star Productions Ltd. and Random House, 
Inc.

*   *   *

The Publisher agrees to include the Author as an additional 
insured under the Author Protection Endorsement to its Media 
Special Perils Policy (the Policy) issued by Safeco 
Corporation (the Insurer), and to pay the premium for the 
Policy, subject to the following:

1. The Author will be an additional insured only in respect 
of the work under the publishing agreement referenced above 
(the Work).
   
2. The limits of liability are $5,000,000 each occurrence 
and $5,000,000 annual aggregate. The $5,000,000 annual 
aggregate limit applies to all named insureds and additional 
insureds.
   
3. The deductible is $100,000 each occurrence. The first 
$40,000 of such deductible will be shared equally by the 
Publisher and the Author and the Publisher will absorb the 
balance of the deductible, except as follows:
   
   (a) If a claim (other than a claim for copyright 
      infringement) to which the deductible relates results 
      in an adverse judgment, or a settlement involving the 
      payment of money damages to the claimant, the entire 
      deductible will be shared equally by the Publisher and 
      the Author.
   
   (b) If a claim to which the deductible relates is for 
      copyright infringement and results in an adverse 
      judgment, or a settlement involving the payment of 
      money damages to the claimant or discontinuance of 
      publication of the Work, the entire deductible will be 
      absorbed by the Author. The Author will reimburse the 
      Publisher promptly from time-to-time for the Author's 
      share of any costs within the deductible.
   
4. The coverage is for loss, in excess of the deductible and 
within the limits of liability, because of liability 
resulting from claims for:
   
   (a) Libel, slander or other forms of defamation;

   (b) Invasion or infringement of the right of privacy or 
       publicity;
   
   (c) Infringement of copyright, title or slogan, and 
       unfair competition in connection therewith;
   
   (d) Plagiarism, piracy, misappropriation of ideas under 
       implied contract, or other misappropriation of 
       property right;
   
   (e) Errors or omissions arising out of the publication of 
       the Work by Publisher or its licensees, subject to 
       all of the terms and conditions of the Policy, if the 
       Work is published during 1990. If the Work is 
       published after 1990 and the Publisher has in effect 
       an insurance policy that includes an endorsement 
       permitting the inclusion of authors as additional 
       insureds, the Publisher will include the Author as an 
       additional insured thereunder on the same terms chat 
       the Publisher then is extending such coverage 
       generally to all of the Publisher's authors.
   
5. The coverage includes the Author's liability to Publisher 
under Paragraph 4.b. of the above referenced contract that 
results from claims described in paragraph 4, above, in 
excess of the deductible and within the limits of liability. 
The Author acknowledges that such limits of liability may 
effectively be decreased or exhausted as a result of 
occurrences during a year that are related to other works 
and other additional insureds and that the Author's 
liability to the Publisher in excess of such coverage is not 
affected hereby.
   
6. Paragraph 4.b. of the above referenced contract is 
amended as follows:
   
   (a) In the second line after "defend" insert ", and to 
       settle,"
   
   (b) Delete (b)(ii) in its entirety.
   
7. The coverage includes the cost of defense of claims 
described in paragraph 4, above, subject to the deductible 
and the limits of liability. The Publisher and the Author 
will be represented by counsel selected by the Publisher; 
provided, however, that if the Publisher notifies the Author 
at any time that such dual representation, in the 
Publisher's judgment, might present a conflict of interests, 
the Insurer shall select and retain separate counsel to 
represent the Author, in which case the cost of such 
separate defense will he included with other costs of 
defense. If the Author is not so required to have separate 
counsel but elects to do so, the entire cost associated 
therewith will be borne by the Author.

<P>According to Joan Collins, she submitted the complete manuscript for "A Ruling Passion," on schedule. The manuscript follows the outline she devised with Random House editor Rosemary Cheetham, she said. But after Cheetham resigned, her new editor lost faith in the project and told her "nobody is interested" in the book's characters. To back out of the contract, the publisher created the ploy that she didn't finish her work on time, Collins said. In this Dec. 11, 1995 affirmation in support of motion for a summary judgment, Collins recounts her deteriorating relationship with her publisher.</P>

SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK  
COUNTY OF NEW YORK  
----------------------------------------	x 
 
RANDOM HOUSE UK LIMITED and RANDOM HOUSE, INC., 
 Plaintiffs,		 
 
-against-		 
 
GEMINI STAR PRODUCTIONS LIMITED, JOAN  
COLLINS and MARTIN D. SINGER, as Trustee of the   
Irving P. And Mary Lazar Trust,  
Defendants. 
 
AFFIRMATION IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR   
SUMMARY JUDGMENT  
 
Hon. Ira Gammerman	 Index No. 114874/94 PC -#9803  
 
----------------------------------------	x 
 
JOAN COLLINS, affirms the following facts under penalties of 
perjury:(1) 
 
1.     I am a defendant in the above-captioned matter, President of 
my co-defendant, Gemini Star Productions Limited ("Gemini"), 
and am submitting this affidavit in support of my and Gemini's 
motion for partial summary judgment dismissing the fourth, fifth 
and sixth causes of action set forth in the second amended 
complaint verified April 23, 1995, and in support of Gemini's 
motion for summary judgment on its first and second 
counterclaims against Random House, Inc. 
 
2.     Although I am best known as actress, having had a successful 
career on the stage, on screen and on television for many years, I 
have also achieved a certain recognition and success as a best 
selling author. In 1978, I wrote Past Imperfect, An Autobiography, 
which was published in 1978 and was a worldwide bestseller. 
Subsequently, I wrote and published in England The Joan Collins 
Beauty Book, which was also a bestseller in 1980, and a year later, 
Katy, a Fight for Life, which was intended to reach a much smaller 
audience. 
 
3.     In 1988, my novel, Prime Time, was published in the United 
States by Simon & Schuster and in England by Century. Prime 
Time was the first novel that I had ever written, and, I am happy to 
say, it found a wide acceptance throughout the English-speaking 
world. Indeed, it was among the top all-time best-selling first 
novels published since 1945, and so recognized by Publishers 
Weekly. 
 
4.     In 1990, my second novel, Love and Desire and Hate, was 
published successfully in the United States and in Great Britain, 
and in 1993, My Secrets, a beauty book, was on the English 
bestseller list for many weeks. 
 
5.     Because of the incidents giving rise to this lawsuit and the 
dispute over the two books which I wrote for plaintiffs in this case, 
I did not publish a novel for some time after Love and Desire and 
Hate. However, earlier this year, the third novel of mine to be 
published, Too Damn Famous, was released in England by Orion 
Press, and once again, found a place on the English bestseller lists. 
That novel will be published in May of 1996 in the United States 
by Dutton. 
 
6.     My original publisher in the United States was Simon & 
Schuster and in Great Britain, Century, which subsequently 
merged with Hutchinson and in 1990 was acquired by Random 
House, Inc. and changed its name to Random House UK. 
 
7.     In 1988, Gemini and I entered into a two-book agreement 
with Century Hutchinson, the first of which books was Love And 
Desire And Hate, which, as I have noted, was published 
successfully in Great Britain in 1990. My publisher in the United 
States was Simon & Schuster, and although Love and Desire and 
Hate was also published successfully by that house, for reasons 
which have nothing to do with this lawsuit, it became clear in 1990 
that it would be appropriate for me to seek another U.S. publisher. 
Accordingly, I asked Irving P. Lazar, my agent, to try and find 
another publisher for my next novel. During the spring of 1990, he 
advised me that he was negotiating with Joni Evans of Random 
House, and subsequently I learned he had entered into a two-book 
deal with Random House pursuant to which that house would 
acquire the U.S. rights to my next two novels. That contract and 
my personal guaranty of it, copies of which are annexed as 
Exhibits A and B hereto, were executed in the late spring of 1990. 
 
8.     In December of 1990, I submitted an outline via Mr. Lazar to 
Joni Evans, and I met with her at my home in California on 
February 19, 1991, at which time we worked on a  revised outline 
for my novel. 
 
9.     In June of 1991, Ms. Evans and Rosemary Cheetham, the 
English editor who, along with Joni Evans, was jointly responsible 
for editing my book, met with me over a three-day period at my 
Los Angeles home. That meeting resulted in a plot outline which it 
was my intention to turn into the first novel required under the 
contract. 
 
10.     I spent the summer of 1991 at my vacation home in the 
South of France and spent most of that summer writing the first 
novel which I had agreed to deliver in the contract based on the 
agreed-upon plot outline. Although the contract provides at 
paragraph 28(a) that only the first half of my first manuscript was 
due by September 1, 1991 (and also provides that I had 90 days 
grace after that date within which to deliver the manuscript), in fact 
I finished the entire manuscript by the end of September and 
delivered to Random US and Random UK a complete manuscript 
for a novel tentatively entitled, A Ruling Passion, based upon the 
outline that my editor and I had created. A copy of that manuscript 
is submitted as Exhibit MS-1 with this motion. 
 
11.     Shortly after delivering the manuscript of A Ruling Passion, 
Rosemary Cheetham resigned as a result of the discharge of her 
husband, who was Random UK's chairman at that time. 
 
12. Although it is not clear whether or not Ms. Cheetham read the 
manuscript before she resigned, it is clear that Joni Evans, the 
editor at Random US, and her staff were not pleased with it. On 
October 22, 1991, I received a letter from her, a copy of which is 
annexed as Exhibit C, in which she told me that "the book has a 
long way to go." However, at this point, I still had every reason to 
believe that Ms. Evans thought that the manuscript that I had 
submitted could, with the proper editorial assistance, be turned into 
a published book. Her letter was sent to me while I was on tour 
with a stage play. Because my schedule called for me to travel 
across the United States over the next five months, I was unable to 
meet with her. Since I had not had the benefit of detailed, 
substantive comments, it was impossible for me to work on the 
manuscript during that time. 
 
13.     My tour took me to New York in February of 1992, and 
while in New York, I had several meetings with Joni Evans and 
other members of her staff, including an associate by the name of 
Julie Grau. 
 
14.     In those meetings, Ms. Evans and Ms. Grau made clear that 
Exhibit, C seriously understated the intensity of their reaction to 
my manuscript. It was not merely a matter of their not liking it; 
they wanted it completely rewritten. For instance, Ms. Grau told 
me that the plot (which followed closely the outline I had agreed 
on with Joni Evans and Rosemary Cheetham in June) would have 
to be junked because "nobody is interested in" the type of 
characters I had agreed to write about. 
 
15.     Essentially, therefore, my U.S. editors wanted me to start 
again from ground zero and to write a completely new book! As a 
result, early in March of 1992, I had a meeting with Joni Evans and 
Julie Grau, as a result of which we came up with an entirely new 
plot which I assumed (since my contract delivery date for my first 
book had come and gone and since Random US had clearly 
rejected the first manuscript) was to be the plot for Work #2. 
 
16.     After our meetings in early March, Julie Grau wrote Joni 
Evans a memorandum of our discussions which Joni Evans (after 
some additional conversations with me) turned into a four-page 
plot outline of the new book and which she and Julie Grau sent me 
on April 3. 
 
17.     Ms. Evans and I had some additional correspondence with 
respect to the plot that she and I had worked out together, and in 
late April I delivered to her a number of pages representing my 
most recent efforts.    
 
18.     Initially, I got back a very positive response. As appears 
from her fax to me dated May 1, 1992, a copy of which I attach as 
Exhibit D, she thought that the first few pages were "quite good -- 
lively, fast-paced, nicely populated." In that same letter, she also 
told me that she would like to set up a system so that she could 
review the chapters of my new cook as I wrote them. 
Unfortunately, no such system was ever put into place. 
 
19.     Sometime in June 1992, I moved again to my home in the 
South of France where I began to write Work #2, the working title 
of which was Hell Hath No Furry, although at times it was also 
known as Atlanta or Athena, after the changing name of its main 
character. I spent most of the late spring and summer of 1992 
working on this manuscript, and while I got some feedback from 
my editors, much of it was inconsistent and difficult to work with. 
 
20.     For instance, in June 1992, Kate Parkin, who had succeeded 
Rosemary Cheetham as my editor at Random UK, faxed to my 
agent that my new material was fine "at this first draft stage." 
However, two days later, I received a letter from Joni Evans which 
made it clear that she was not pleased with the way things were 
going. 
 
21.     In any case, I continued to write and to send pages to my 
editors. What I did not discover until much later was that my 
editors -- at least my British editors -- without telling me (and in 
spite of the fact that I received from Random UK only encouraging 
reactions) had already decided that they no longer wished to 
continue with the project. 
 
22.     For instance, on June 12, 1992, Simon Master, the publisher 
of Random UK, apparently found a copy of a draft letter that Joni 
Evans proposed sending to my agent, which had been faxed to 
Kate Parkin. He sent a note to her on the cover page of the fax, 
which I annex hereto as Exhibit E, and in which he told her that 
"maybe the time has come to look for a way out or possibly a 
renegotiation which  might lead to the former." 
 
23.     Apparently, Random UK's attitude was communicated to 
Random US since barely two months later Ms. Parkin faxed to Joni 
Evans, reminding her that she already knew that Random UK " . . . 
would like to take any opportunity offered to cancel this contract. 
Bizarrely enough, this fax from Kate Parkin followed only by a 
day a fax in which she commented on pages which I had sent to 
her, telling Ms. Evans that "I agree with you -- it's a vast 
improvement and even, in parts, quite startlingly inventive.' 
 
24.     Naturally, I had no idea of my editors, dissatisfaction, and 
although I was surprised that despite her several promises and my 
repeated telephonic invitations (and despite the fact that I knew 
Joni Evans had spent a week or so working with Michael Caine in 
Europe that summer on his book), she never made any attempt to 
arrange to come to work with me at my home in the South of 
France. In any case, using the new plot outline that I had been 
given as a guide, I worked all summer on this manuscript, 
unfortunately without any editorial input. 
 
25. On September 21, I shipped the manuscript of Hell Hath No 
Fury -- the second book that I had written for Random US under 
the current contract -- to Joni Evans and Kate Parkin. A copy of 
that manuscript is submitted herewith, identified as MS-2. 
 
26. On October 6, 1992, I received a response from Joni Evans to 
the manuscript that I had submitted, which made it clear that Hell 
Hath No Fury did not please her any more than had A Ruling 
Passion. Indeed, she wrote to me suggesting that she put "an editor 
on site" to work with me. 
 
27.     On October 26, I wrote to her, agreeing that the manuscript 
needed heavy replotting but telling her that I thought I could do it 
without the help of an editor. I promised her that I would send her 
100 pages by the end of that year. On November 2, she wrote back 
to me, expressing her skepticism both with my plan of reworking 
the manuscript on my own and with some of the specific changes 
that I had referred to her (Exhibit G). 
 
28.     However, she agreed in that letter to give me the chance ("I'll 
be happy to let you carry out your plan for the next few months"), 
and so once again, I began to work, this time trying to revise the 
manuscript of Work #2, and in December 1992, I forwarded the 
first 100 or so pages of it to her, along with an outline of the 
balance. That material is submitted herewith as Exhibit MS-3. 
 
29.     Unfortunately, as I learned as the result of discovery in this 
case, in early November she had been told by Alberto Vitale, the 
chairman of Random House, that is no longer wished to keep open 
Turtle Bay, the imprint that had been created especially for her. 
Apparently, she spent much of November and December 
negotiating with Mr. Vitale for her professional life, and it appears 
that she was not about to devote any time in that period to 
reviewing or editing my manuscript. 
 
30.     This would explain why, when questioned about it at her 
deposition, she had only the vaguest recollection of the manuscript 
which had been submitted in late 1992. Annexed as Exhibit F are 
pages 315 through 317 of the transcript of Ms. Evans' deposition of 
November 29, 1995, which makes clear how little impact my 
redraft had made upon her. 
 
31. The lack of impact of my third submission is made even clearer 
by the fact that on February 9, 1993, Random US wrote to me and 
to Gemini, claiming that we were in default for failure to deliver a 
satisfactory manuscript despite the fact that we had at that point 
delivered two and one third manuscripts, as well as an outline for 
the remaining two-thirds of the third work.

NOTES  
(1) Counsel have agreed that in view of the fact that I am presently 
in London, England, where I reside, I may submit this statement in 
support of my motion under penalties of perjury rather than under 
formal oath administered by a notary public.

<P>After topless photos of  her appeared in The Globe in 1991, Joan Collins sued the tabloid newspaper for damages, claiming that she suffered such aggravation that she was unable to continue writing. Random House is trying to use this claim against her, maintaining that it is proof that she did not submit a complete manuscript for "A Ruling Passion."  In this Jan. 3, 1996 affirmation Joan Collins says, "I now realize that I was mistaken when I made those statements."</P>

2. In their opposition to my motion, plaintiffs rely extensively on 
my testimony in an action entitled Joan Collins v. Globe 
International, Inc. et al. , (Superior Court, Los Angeles County), 
primarily in an attempt to prove (1) that I never delivered a 
"complete manuscript" and (2) that I never submitted any material 
for Work #2 under the Contract. Both of these claims are false, and 
in this affirmation I address each in turn. 
 
A. I DELIVERED COMPLETE MANUSCRIPTS 
 
3.   Plaintiffs offer the deposition of Lisa Drew for the definition of 
a "complete manuscript" -- a phrase they claim is a widely used 
and understood term in the publishing industry. I am told that there 
is no such accepted meaning and that in any case, the meaning of 
"complete manuscript" in the context of my contract with plaintiffs 
is clear from the Contract itself. 
 
4.     The reference to a "complete manuscript" does not appear in 
paragraph 2, the delivery clause of the Contract. Paragraph 2 
requires not a "complete" manuscript but "complete copies of the 
manuscript . . . satisfactory the Publisher." It is not until paragraphs 
28 (a) and (c), which address what would happen if I had not 
delivered "one-half of the manuscript" at subparagraphs (I) and (ii), 
does the Contract provide for the eventuality that I would not 
deliver a "complete" manuscript in subparagraph (iii). 
 
5.     Thus "complete manuscript" in the context of the Contract 
means a manuscript that is not the "one-half manuscript" referred 
to at subparagraphs (I) and (ii), and "complete" is a description of 
quantity, not quality. 
 
 6.   Plaintiffs' quote from, statements that Alan Nevins and I made 
about the effect that being Photographed had had on my ability to 
continue writing during the summer of  1991, in an attempt to 
show that the pressure and aggravation of having learned about this 
gross invasion of privacy prevented me from writing. 
 
7.     However, I now realize that, I was mistaken when I made 
those statements. As I testified in the Globe deposition, I did not 
learn about the publication of the Globe Photographs until late 
August of 1991. By that time, I had been working on Work #1 for 
about five months. Clearly, since I delivered that manuscript in 
September, I had, at that point, substantially finished my work on 
the manuscript. Thus, it was inaccurate of me to say that the Globe 
incident prevented me from writing. Although this incident 
certainly made my life more difficult in the months following my 
learning about the publication, I had substantially completed my 
work on the manuscript before I learned of the Globe's invasion or 
my privacy, and thus I was able to deliver a complete manuscript 
for Work #1 in September of 1991 -- a fact that absolutely refutes 
plaintiffs' claim that I delivered nothing! In light of the fact that 
plaintiffs' employees acknowledged receipt of my first manuscript, 
it is absolutely shocking that plaintiffs now claim that I never 
submitted a complete manuscript. 
 
8   Defendants' claim that I did not deliver  a complete manuscript 
is especially shocking in view of the testimony of Rosemary 
Cheetham, who was the publishing director of defendant Random 
House UK and my editor until shortly after I delivered the 
manuscript of Work #1  At her  deposition, taken in this case in 
London on October 13,  Ms. Cheetham was shown what is 
submitted herewith as MS-1, and the following colloquy took 
place: 
 
  Q:     When you received Exhibit 16, did you consider that Joan 
Collins fulfilled her obligation to deliver a manuscript? 
 
               A: Sorry, "Exhibit 16" being? 
 
               Q: Being (indicating). 
 
               A: Yes, I did. 
 
               MR. CALLAGY: Object to the form of the question. 
 
               Q:     Under the agreement previously marked between 
Random House UK and Joan Collins, at that point was Joan 
Collins entitled to receive any money, if you           remember? 
 
               A:     I believe she was entitled to receive her delivery 
advance. 
 
(Page 105, line 24; page 106, line 15, annexed hereto as Exhibit 
A.) 
 
9.     While the question of my entitlement to the payment of my 
delivery advance under the UK contract is different than the 
question of my entitlement to the protection of the first proceeds 
under the US contract, the opinion of Ms. Cheetham, an 
internationally respected and highly experience editor is surely, I 
submit, entitled to some weight. It certainly belies plaintiffs' claim 
that I had never lived up to my obligations under the Contract. 
 
B.     I SUBMITTED A COMPLETE MANUSCRIPT FOR 
WORK #2 
 
10.     As was explained in my prior affirmation, and as is clear 
from my and Gemini's motion for partial summary judgment, I 
have always followed theatrical and motion picture usage and 
referred to "draft" or "manuscript" interchangeably. Therefore, my 
labeling a manuscript as a "draft" was not intended to have any 
bearing on the content of the work. 
 
11.     Although I occasionally get mixed up about dates and I use 
the words "draft" and "manuscript" as synonyms, there is at least 
one thing about which I am certain: I submitted two separate 
manuscripts to Random House US. Those manuscripts are annexed 
to this motion as Exhibits MS-1 and MS-2. 
 
12.     I submitted the manuscript of the first novel I wrote for 
plaintiffs, MS-1, in September of 1991. In my letter that 
accompanied it, I wrote to my editors "Well, here it is. The first 
draft of The Ruling Passion." (Annexed hereto as Exhibit B.) In 
that letter, I acknowledged that the manuscript needed some 
additional work, but my belief was that it was near completion. 
That I intended it to be something more than a rough draft is 
evidenced by the fact that in the letter, I expressed the hope that the 
manuscript would be published in the spring of 1992. 
 
13.     In March of 1992, I had a meeting with Joni Evans and  Julie 
Grau. At that time, I was told for the first time that  the manuscript 
was completely unsatisfactory. Even still, I hoped to somehow be 
able to salvage the book that I had spent so much time and energy 
writing. 
 
14.     One month later, I was deposed in connection with the Globe 
case. At that time, not only was I starring in the Broadway 
production of "Private Lives," but I was also worrying about the 
Globe case and coming to terms with the publication of intimate 
pictures of myself in a tabloid newspaper. Furthermore, I was 
trying to deal with the fact that Joni Evans and Julie Grau had in 
effect completely rejected my complete manuscript. All of these 
events took place in an extremely short time span -- from March to 
April of 1992. 
 
15.     When I was deposed in connection with the Globe case and 
stated that I was still working on the first manuscript, I meant what 
I said. At some point in time very close to that deposition, 
however, I realized that I had to accept my publisher's directions 
and cease completely all work on Work # 1. So I began the 
laborious process of writing a new book.  
 16. Thus, in April 1992, I wrote to Joni Evans explaining that I 
was preparing to write the entirely new plot that she, Julie Grau 
and I had worked out in March. In my letter to her I stated "Have 
been thinking seriously about the synopsis and I will be speaking 
to you in the middle of next week before I start getting down to it." 
(A copy of this letter is annexed hereto as Exhibit C.) My 
acceptance of Ms. Evans' view that I needed to write an entirely 
new book came several weeks after the Globe deposition, and I did 
not actually start writing Work #2, whose working title was Hell 
Hath No Fury, until the early spring of 1992. 
 
17.     Statements made by Joni Evans during her deposition in 
connection with the Globe case confirm all of this. Ms. Evans 
testified that the manuscript delivered by me in September of 1991 
was not acceptable. In a series of questions about letters that 
contained editorial comments about work #1, Ms. Evans was 
asked: 
 
Q:     So, in essence, this letter memorialized your lack of 
satisfaction with the book? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
(Evans Globe deposition, page 80, lines 13-16, annexed hereto as 
Exhibit D). In the same deposition, Ms. Evans admitted that after 
she rejected my first effort as unacceptable, stopped working on 
Work #1 and began a new book from scratch. 
 
18. What all of this shows is that while there may not be a 
definitive date, and while my memory of events may have rendered 
my globe deposition inaccurate, it is indisputable that ultimately I 
delivered in a timely manner two different, complete manuscripts.

 NOTES  
(1.) Counsel have agreed that in view of the fact that I am presently 
in London, England, where I reside, I  may submit this statement in 
support of my motion under penalties of perjury rather than under 
formal oath administered by a notary public.

 AS AND FOR A FIRST COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE 
DEFENSE TO THE FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION SET FORTH 
IN THE COMPLAINT 
 
 9.     Gemini timely delivered a manuscript of Book #2 ready for 
press. Plaintiff Random House UK failed to acknowledge delivery 
of that manuscript or to edit or to publish it.

SET FORTH IN THE COMPLAINT 
 
10.     The payments provided for at paragraph 10 of the First 
Random House UK Agreement did not "arrive within ten days 
after the date due." As a result, therefore, all rights in Book #2 
"revert[ed]" to Gemini, and defendant is entitled to retain so much 
of the advance as therefore had been paid.                      
 
AS AND FOR A FIRST COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE 
TO THE THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION SET FORTH IN THE 
COMPLAINT 
 
11.     Gemini timely delivered a manuscript of Book #3 ready for 
press. Random House UK failed to acknowledge delivery of that 
manuscript or to edit it or to publish it.                      
 
AS AND FOR A SECOND COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE 
DEFENSE TO                     THE THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION 
SET FORTH IN THE COMPLAINT 
 
 12.     The payments provided for at paragraph 11 of the Second 
Random House Agreement did not "arrive within ten days after the 
date due." As a result, therefore, all rights in Book #3 reverted to

theretofore had been paid. 
 
AS AND FOR A FIRST COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE 
TO THE FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION SET FORTH IN THE 
COMPLAINT 
 
13.     Gemini delivered the manuscript: of Work #1 prior to March 
1, 1992. By the terms of paragraph 27 of the Random House, Inc. 
Agreement, the $500,000 advance allocable to Work #l was, by 
reason of such delivery, no longer "repayable." 
 
AS AND FOR A SECOND COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE 
DEFENSE TO THE FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION SET 
FORTH IN THE  COMPLAINT 
 
14.     Paragraph 28(b) of the Random House, Inc. Agreement 
provides that if that agreement were terminated pursuant to the 
provisions of paragraph 28(a)(ii) or 28(a)(iv), Gemini's " . . . 
obligation to repay the amounts advanced hereunder shall be 
limited to repayment of the proceeds of the sale or licensing by the 
[defendant] of rights in the Work of the kind granted to the 
plaintiff Random House, Inc.] hereunder." 
 
15.     Gemini timely delivered a manuscript for Work #1 which 
was not, in Random House, Inc.'s judgment, satisfactory, and 
Random House, Inc. subsequently purported to exercise its right to 
terminate the agreement. 
 
16.     There are no proceeds from the sale or licensing by Gemini 
of rights in Work #1. Therefore, Random House, Inc. is not entitled 
to repayment of any amounts advanced in respect of Work #1.  
AS AND FOR A THIRD COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE 
DEFENSE TO THE FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION SET 
FORTH IN THE COMPLAINT 
 
17.     Gemini delivered a complete manuscript for Work #1 in a 
timely manner, which manuscript did not violate common law or 
statutory copyright or right of privacy of any person or contain 
libelous or obscene matter, but which was not acceptable to 
Random House, Inc. for publication. Pursuant to paragraph 31(a) 
of the Random House, Inc. Agreement, Random House, Inc. was 
therefore not entitled to repayment of the advance. 
 
AS AND FOR A FIRST COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE 
TO THE FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION SET FORTH IN THE 
COMPLAINT 
 
18.     Gemini delivered the manuscript for Work #2 prior to 
September 1, 1993. By the terms of paragraph 27 of the Random 
House, Inc. Agreement, the $500,000 advance allo- cable to Work 
#2 was, by reason of such delivery, no longer "repayable-" 
 
 AS AND FOR A SECOND COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE 
DEFENSE TO THE FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION SET FORTH 
IN THE COMPLAINT 
 
           19.     Paragraph 28(d) provides that if the Random House, 
Inc. Agreement is terminated pursuant to the provisions of 
paragraph 2 8 (c) (ii) or 2 8 (c) (iv) , Gemini's "obligation to repay 
the amounts advanced hereunder shall be limited to repayment of 
the proceeds of the sale or licensing by the [defendant] of rights in 
the Work of the kind granted to the Random House, Inc.] 
hereunder." 
 
20.     Gemini timely delivered a manuscript for Work #2 which 
was not, in Random House, Inc.'s judgment, satisfactory, and 
plaintiff subsequently purported to exercise its right to terminate 
the agreement. 
 
21.     There are no proceeds from the sale or licensing by 
defendant of rights in Work #2. Therefore, Random House, Inc. is 
not entitled to repayment of any amounts advanced in respect of 
Work #2. 
 
AS AND FOR A THIRD COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE 
DEFENSE TO THE FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION SET FORTH 
IN THE COMPLAINT 
 
22.     Gemini delivered a complete manuscript for Work #2 in a 
timely manner, which manuscript did not violate common law or 
statutory copyright or right of privacy of any person or contain 
libelous or obscene matter, but which was not acceptable to 
Random House, Inc. for publication. Pursuant to paragraph 31(b) 
of the Random House, Inc. Agreement, plaintiff was therefore not 
entitled to repayment of the advance. 
 
In the alternative, Gemini respectfully alleges as its counterclaims 
and cross-claims: 
 
AS AND FOR A FIRST COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST 
RANDOM HOUSE UK 
 
23.   At all times hereinafter mentioned, Gemini was and is a 
corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of 
California with a principal place of business in Los Angeles, 
California. 
 
24.   On information and belief, Random House UK is a 
corporation incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom, 
maintaining its principal office and place of business at 20 
Vauxhall Bridge Road, London SW1V 2SA, England. 
 
25.     In or about April 25, 1988,Gemini and Random House UK 
entered into an agreement providing for the publication of two 
untitled novels by Joan Collins (the "First Random House UK 
Agreement"). In or about May of 1990, defendant delivered the 
first novel written by Joan Collins pursuant to that agreement, 
which was successfully published by Random House UK. 
 
26.     In or about September 1991, Gemini delivered a manuscript 
for Book 2 under the First Random House UK Agreement. 
Random House UK never responded to or acknowledge the 
delivery of that manuscript, never edited it or provided Gemini or 
Joan Collins with any editorial comments, assistance or help, and 
failed to publish it. 
 
27.     More than 18 months have passed since the manuscript was 
delivered to Random House UK. 
 
28.     Pursuant to the First Random House UK Agreement, Gemini 
was to receive additional advances as follows: 
 
*$300,000 on delivery of the completed typescript for Book 2; 
 
*$300,000 on the first publication of Book 2 in hardcover; 
        
*$300,000 on the first mass market publication of  Book 2; 
 
*$300,000 six months after mass market publication of Book 2, 
 
which payments total of $1,200,000, no part of which has been 
paid. No demand has been made for the payment of such sums 
since, in view of Random House UK's purported cancellation of 
the First Random House UK Agreement, such demand would have 
been futile. 
 
29.     Gemini has been damaged by Random House UK's failure to 
pay the sum of $1,200,000. 
 
AS AND FOR A SECOND COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST 
RANDOM HOUSE UK 
 
30.     Defendant repeats and realleges each and every allegation 
contained in paragraphs 23 through 25 of its first counterclaim 
against Random House UK. 
 
31.     On or about August 28, 1990, Gemini and Random House 
UK entered into an agreement providing for the publication of an 
untitled novel by Joan Collins (the "Second Random House UK 
Agreement"). 
 
32.     In or about September, 1992, Gemini delivered a manuscript 
pursuant to that agreement. Random House UK never responded to 
or acknowledged the delivery of that manuscript, never edited or 
provided defendant or Joan Collins with any editorial comments, 
assistance or help, and failed to publish it. 
 
33. Pursuant to the Second Random House UK Agreement, Gemini 
was to receive additional advances as follows: 
 
* $150,000 on delivery or the complete typescript; 
 
* $150,000 on publication or nine months after delivery; 
 
* $150,000 on publication of the paperback or twelve months after 
delivery, 
 
which payments total $450,000, no part of which has been paid. 
No demand has been made for the payment of such sums since, in 
view of Random House UK's purported cancellation of the Second 
Random House UK Agreement, such demand would have been 
futile. 
 
34.     Gemini has been damaged by Random House UK's failure to 
pay the sum of $450,000. 
 
AS AND FOR A FIRST COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST 
RANDOM HOUSE, INC. 
 
35. On information and belief, defendant Random House Inc. 
(Random House") was and is a New York corporation with its 
principal place of business at 201 East 50th Street, New York, New 
York 10022. 
 
36.   On or about June 5, 1990, Random House and Gemini entered 
into a written agreement (the "Agreement") providing for the 
publication of two untitled novels ("Work No. 1" and Work No. 
2") by Joan Collins. 
 
37.     On or before March 1, 1992, the manuscript for Work No. 1 
was delivered to Random House by Gemini. 
 
38.     Defendant Random House purported to reject the manuscript 
for Work No. 1 on the ground that it was unsatisfactory within the 
meaning of paragraph 2 of the Agreement. 
 
39.     However, the manuscript for Work No. 1 did not violate 
common law or statutory copyright or the right of privacy of any 
person or contained libelous or obscene matter. 
 
40.     Paragraph 31(a) of the Agreement provides that in the event 
that the manuscript for Work No. 1 was not satisfactory, but that it 
was delivered in a timely manner and did not violate common law 
or statutory copyright or the right of privacy of any person or 
contain libelous or obscene matter, then the balance of the advance 
for Work No. 1 was to be paid in two installments: $500,000 
within one year after delivery, and $500,000 within two years after 
delivery. 
 
41.     Random House has failed to pay any portion of the 
additional advances as provided for in Paragraph 31(a). No demand 
has been made for such sums since, in view of plaintiff's purported 
cancellation of the Agreement, such demands would have been 
futile. 
 
42.     Gemini has been damaged by plaintiff's failure to pay such 
advances in the sum of $1,000,000. 
 
AS AND FOR A SECOND  COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST 
RANDOM HOUSE, INC. 
 
43.     Gemini repeats and realleges each and every allegation 
contained in paragraphs 35 and 36 of its first counterclaim against 
Random House, Inc. 
 
44.     On or before September 1, 1993, the manuscript for Work 
No. 2 was delivered to Random House by Gemini. 
 
45.     Defendant Random House purported to reject the manuscript 
for Work No. 2 on the ground that it was unsatisfactory within the 
meaning of paragraph 2 of the Agreement. 
 
46.     However, the manuscript for Work No. 2 did not violate 
common law or statutory copyright or the right of privacy of any 
person or contained libelous or obscene matter. 
 
47.     Paragraph 31(b) of the Agreement provides that in the event 
that the manuscript for Work No. 2 was not satisfactory, but that it 
was delivered in a timely manner and did not violate common law 
or statutory copyright or the right of privacy of any person or 
contain libelous or obscene matter, then the balance of the advance 
for Work No. 2 was to be paid in two installments: $500,000 
within one year after delivery, and $500,000 within two years after 
delivery. 
 
48.     Random House has failed to pay any portion of the 
additional advances as provided for in Paragraph 31(b). No 
demand has been made for such sums since, in view of plaintiff's 
purported cancellation of the Agreement, such demands would 
have been futile. 
 
49.     Gemini has been damaged by plaintiff's failure to pay such 
advances in the sum of $1,000,000. 
 
AS AND FOR A FIRST CROSS-CLAIM 
 
50. Gemini repeats and realleges each and every allegation 
contained in paragraphs 26-32 and 34-37 of its counterclaims. 
 
51.     On information and belief, Lazar acted as an agent or broker 
in connection with the execution of both Random House UK 
Agreements. 
 
52.     A portion of the advance paid to defendant Gemini in respect 
of that agreement was paid to and retained by Lazar, to wit: the 
sum of $225,000 in respect of Book #2 under the First Random 
House UK Agreement. 
 
53.     In the event that Gemini is required to repay to plaintiffs any 
sums attributable to the Lazar commissions, it is entitled to receive 
the amount thus paid from defendant Singer, as the successor to 
Lazar. 
 
AS AND FOR A SECOND CROSS-CLAIM 
 
54.     Defendant Gemini repeats and realleges each and every 
allegation contained in paragraphs 26-32 and 34-37 of its 
counterclaims and paragraphs 39-41 of its first cross- claim. 
 
55.     Lazar never took any steps to document the submission of 
Work #2 or Work #3 to Random House UK, or to place plaintiff on 
notice of the fact that defendant Gemini. by such delivery, 
considered its obligations under the Random House UK 
Agreements to be complete. Lazar also failed or omitted to demand 
payment from Random House UK of the balance of the advances 
due under Gemini's respective contracts with plaintiffs. 
 
56.     As Gemini's agent, Lazar was Gemini's fiduciary and owed it 
a duty of care. 
 
57.     Lazar's failure to act as aforesaid represented a deviation 
from and a breach of its duty of care. 
 
58.     Defendant has been injured by such breach and deviation in 
the sum of $1,650,000. 
 
AS AND FOR A THIRD CROSS-CLAIM 
 
59.     Lazar acted as Gemini's agent in connection with a work 
known as Prime Time. On or about March 31, 1989, Lazar 
received a payment from Simon & Schuster in the sum of 
$347,149.84, from which sum it deducted $34,714.98 before 
paying the balance to Gemini. That deduction was improper and 
unwarranted, and has not been repaid although duly demanded. 
 
AS AND FOR A FOURTH CROSS-CLAIM 
 
60.     Lazar acted as Gemini's agent in connection with a work 
known as Love & Desire & Hate. On or about September 30, 1992, 
Lazar received a payment from Simon & Schuster in the sum of 
$234,011.19, from which sum it deducted $23,401.19 before 
paying the balance to Gemini. That deduction was improper and 
unwarranted, and has not been repaid although duly demanded. 
 
WHEREFORE, defendant Gemini Star Productions Ltd. demands 
judgment: 
 
1.     Dismissing the complaint on the merits, and that plaintiffs 
take nothing thereby; and 
 
2.     On its first counterclaim in the sum of $1,200,000 against 
plaintiff Random House UK Limited; 
 
3.     On its second counterclaim in the sum of $450,000 against 
plaintiff Random House UK Limited; 
 
4.     On its third counterclaim in the sum of $1,000,000 against 
plaintiff Random House, Inc.; 
 
5.     On its fourth counterclaim in the sum of $1,000,000 against 
plaintiff Random House, Inc.; 
 
6.     On its first cross-claim against defendant Singer in the sum of 
$225,000; 
 
7.     On its second cross-claim against defendant Singer in the sum 
of $1,650,000; and 
 
8. On its third cross-claim against defendant Singer in the sum of 
$34,714.98, together with interest from March 31, 1989; and 
 
9. On its fourth cross-claim against defendant Singer in the sum of 
$23,401.19, together with interest from September 30, 1992; and 
 
 
10. The costs and disbursements of this action.

Burrows, answering the second amended complaint:

1. DENIES KNOWLEDGE OR INFORMATION SUFFICIENT TO FORM A BELIEF as to
the allegations contained in paragraphs 3, 4, 13 (except that she
ADMITS that defendant Gemini entered into an agreement with Century
Hutchinson Publishers), and 15-17 of the second amended complaint.

2. DENIES each and every allegation contained in paragraphs 6, 8, 10
(except DENIES ON INFORMATION AND BELIEF that Lazar transacted
business in New York), 11, 12, 26, 28, 29 (except ADMITS that the
specified sum has not been paid), 40-42, 47, 49, 50 (except ADMITS
that the specified sum has not been paid), 56, 58, 59 (except ADMITS
that the specified sum has not been paid), and 65 (except ADMITS
that the specified sum has not been paid) of the second amended
complaint.

3. ADMITS ON INFORMATION AND BELIEF the allegations of paragraph 9
of the second amended complaint.

4. ADMITS the allegations of paragraphs 1, 2, 5, 7, 18, 19, and 61
of the second amended complaint.

5. NEITHER ADMITS NOR DENIES the allegations of paragraphs 14, 20,
21, 23, 25, 37, 38 (except that she ADMITS payment of the sum
specified), 39, 44-46 (except that she ADMITS payment of the sum
specified), 52-55 (except that she ADMITS payment of the sum
specified), 62, and 63 of the second amended complaint, and
respectfully refers the court to the agreements, notices, guaranty
and decision referred to for the meaning and contents thereof.

6. NEITHER ADMITS NOR DENIES the allegations of paragraphs 22,
30-36, 43, 51, 60 or 66-71 of the second amended complaint.

7. DENIES each and every allegation contained in paragraph 24 of the

BELIEF that $225,000 of such sum was paid for Lazar's commission.

8. DENIES each and every allegation contained in paragraphs 27, 48,
57, and 64 of the second amended complaint, except that she ADMITS
that Gemini received letters and notices from plaintiffs purporting
to terminate the Random House UK and the Random House, Inc.
agreements.

AS AND FOR A FIRST COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO THE COMPLAINT

9. The court is without personal jurisdiction over Collins because
she has not availed herself of the privilege of conducting activity
within New York.

AS AND FOR A SECOND COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO THE COMPLAINT

10. The second amended complaint fails to state a claim or claims
upon which relief can be granted against defendant.

AS AND FOR A FIRST COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO THE FOURTH AND
SIXTH CAUSES OF ACTION SET FORTH IN THE COMPLAINT

11. Gemini delivered the manuscript of Work #1 prior to March 1,
1992. By the terms of paragraph 27 of the Random House, Inc.
Agreement, the $500,000 advance allocable to Work #1 was, by reason
of such delivery, no longer "repayable."

AS AND FOR A SECOND COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO THE FOURTH AND
SIXTH CAUSES OF ACTION SET FORTH IN THE COMPLAINT

12. Paragraph 28(b) of the Random House, Inc. Agreement provides
that if that agreement were terminated pursuant to the provisions of
paragraph 28(a)(ii) or 28(a)(iv) Gemini's "... obligation to repay
the amounts advanced hereunder shall be limited to repayment of the
proceeds of the sale or licensing by the [defendant] of rights in
the Work of the kind granted to the [Random House, Inc.] hereunder."

13. Gemini timely delivered a manuscript for Work #1 which was not,
in Random House, Inc.'s judgment, satisfactory, and Random House,
Inc. subsequently purported to exercise its right to terminate the
Random House, Inc. Agreement.

14. There are no proceeds from the sale or licensing by Gemini of
rights in Work #1. Therefore, plaintiff Random House, Inc. is not
entitled to repayment of any amounts advanced in respect of Work #1.

AS AND FOR A THIRD COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO THE FOURTH AND
SIXTH CAUSES OF ACTION SET FORTH IN THE COMPLAINT

15. Defendant Gemini delivered a complete manuscript for Work #1 in
a timely manner, which manuscript did not violate common law or
statutory copyright or right of privacy of any person or contain
libelous or obscene matter, but which was not acceptable to Random
House, Inc. for publication. Pursuant to paragraph 31(a) of the
Random House, Inc. Agreement, plaintiff was therefore not entitled
to repayment of the advance.

AS AND FOR A FIRST COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO THE FIFTH AND
SIXTH CAUSES OF ACTION SET FORTH IN THE COMPLAINT

16. Gemini delivered the manuscript for Work #2 prior to September
1, 1993. By the terms of paragraph 27 of the Random House, Inc.
Agreement, the $500,000 advance allocable to Work #2 was, by reason
of such delivery, no longer "repayable."

AS AND FOR A SECOND COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO THE FIFTH AND
SIXTH CAUSES OF ACTION SET FORTH IN THE COMPLAINT

17. Paragraph 28(d) provides that if the Random House, Inc.
Agreement is terminated pursuant to the provisions of paragraph
28(c)(ii) or 28(c)(iv), Gemini's "... obligation to repay the
amounts advanced hereunder shall be limited to repayment of the
proceeds of the sale or licensing by the [defendant] of rights in
the Work of the kind granted to the [Random House, Inc.] hereunder."

18. Gemini timely delivered a manuscript for Work #2 which was not,
in Random House, Inc.'s judgment, satisfactory, and plaintiff
subsequently purported to exercise its right to terminate the
agreement.

19. There are no proceeds from the sale or licensing by Gemini of
rights in Work #2. Therefore, Random House, Inc. is not entitled to
repayment of any amounts advanced in respect of Work #2.

AS AND FOR A THIRD COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO THE FIFTH AND
SIXTH CAUSES OF ACTION SET FORTH IN THE COMPLAINT

20. Gemini delivered a complete manuscript for Work #2 in a timely
manner, which manuscript did not violate common law or statutory
copyright or right of privacy of any person or contain libelous or
obscene matter, but which was not acceptable to Random House, Inc.
for publication. Pursuant to paragraph 31(b) of the Random House,
Inc. Agreement, plaintiff was therefore not entitled to repayment of
the advance.

WHEREFORE, defendant Joan Collins demands judgment:

1. Dismissing the complaint for want of personal and subject matter
jurisdiction, and that plaintiffs take nothing thereby; or, in the
alternative

2. Dismissing the complaint on the merits; and

3. The costs and disbursements of this action.

ANSWER TO SECOND
AMENDED COMPLAINT
AND CROSS-CLAIMS

Defendant Gemini Star Productions Ltd. ("Gemini") by its attorney,
Kenneth David Burrows, answering the second amended complaint:

1. DENIES KNOWLEDGE OR INFORMATION SUFFICIENT TO FORM A BELIEF as to
the allegations contained in paragraphs 3, 4, 13 (except that it
ADMITS entering into an agreement with Century Hutchinson
Publishers), and 15-17 of the second amended complaint.

2. DENIES each and every allegation contained in paragraphs 6, 8, 10
(except DENIES ON INFORMATION AND BELIEF that Lazar transacted
business in New York), 11, 12, 26, 28, 29 (except ADMITS that the
specified sum has not been paid), 40-42, 47, 49, 50 (except ADMITS
that the specified sum has not been paid), 56, 58, and 59 (except
ADMITS that the specified sum has not been paid) of the second
amended complaint.

3. ADMITS ON INFORMATION AND BELIEF the allegations of paragraph 9
of the second amended complaint.

4. ADMITS the allegations of paragraphs 1, 2, 5, 7, 18, and 19 of
the second amended complaint.

5. NEITHER ADMITS NOR DENIES the allegations of paragraphs 14, 20,
21, 23, 25, 37, 38 (except that it ADMITS payment of the sum
specified), 39, 44-46 (except that it ADMITS payment of the sum
specified), and 52-55 (except that it ADMITS payment of the sum
specified) of the second amended complaint, and respectfully refers
the court to the agreements, notices and decision referred to for
the meaning and contents thereof.

6. NEITHER ADMITS NOR DENIES the allegations of paragraphs 22,
30-36, 43, 51, or 60-71 of the second amended complaint.

7. DENIES each and every allegation contained in paragraph 24 of the
second amended complaint, except that it ADMITS that Random House UK
advanced to it a sum of money, and ADMITS ON INFORMATION AND BELIEF
that $225,000 of such sum was paid for Lazar's commission.

8. DENIES each and every allegation contained in paragraphs 27, 48,
and 57 of the second amended complaint, except that it ADMITS that
it received letters and notices from plaintiffs purporting to
terminate the Random House UK and the Random House, Inc. agreements.

AS AND FOR A FIRST COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO THE COMPLAINT

9. The court is without personal jurisdiction over the defendants,
because defendants have not availed themselves of the privilege of
conducting activity within New York.

AS AND FOR A SECOND COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO THE COMPLAINT

10. The second amended complaint fails to state a claim or claims
upon which relief can be granted against defendant.

AS AND FOR A FIRST COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO THE FIRST CAUSE
OF ACTION SET FORTH IN THE COMPLAINT

11. Gemini timely delivered a manuscript of Book #2 ready for press.
Plaintiff Random House UK failed to acknowledge delivery of that
manuscript or to edit or to publish it.

AS AND FOR A SECOND COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO THE FIRST CAUSE
OF ACTION SET FORTH IN THE COMPLAINT

12. The payments provided for at paragraph 10 of the First Random
House UK Agreement did not "arrive within ten days after the date
due."  As a result, therefore, all rights in Book #2 "revert[ed]" to
Gemini, and defendant is entitled to retain so much of the advance
as therefore had been paid.

AS AND FOR A THIRD COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO THE FIRST CAUSE
OF ACTION SET FORTH IN THE COMPLAINT

13. The court is without jurisdiction over Gemini and the subject
matter hereof, because the parties agreed at paragraph 22 of the
First Random House Agreement that any disputes between the parties
would be resolved by arbitration.

AS AND FOR A FIRST COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO THE THIRD CAUSE
OF ACTION SET FORTH IN THE COMPLAINT

14. Gemini timely delivered a manuscript of Book #3 ready for press.
Random House UK failed to acknowledge delivery of that manuscript or
to edit it or to publish it.

AS AND FOR A SECOND COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO THE THIRD CAUSE
OF ACTION SET FORTH IN THE COMPLAINT

15. The payments provided for at paragraph 11 of the Second Random
House Agreement did not "arrive within ten days after the date due."
 As a result, therefore, all rights in Book #3 reverted to Gemini,
and Gemini is entitled to retain so much of the advance as
theretofore had been paid.

AS AND FOR A FIRST COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO THE FOURTH CAUSE
OF ACTION SET FORTH IN THE COMPLAINT

16. Gemini delivered the manuscript of Work #1 prior to March 1,
1992. By the terms of paragraph 27 of the Random House, Inc.
Agreement, the $500,000 advance allocable to Work #1 was, by reason
of such delivery, no longer "repayable."

AS AND FOR A SECOND COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO THE FOURTH CAUSE
OF ACTION SET FORTH IN THE COMPLAINT

17. Paragraph 28(b) of the Random House, Inc. Agreement provides
that if that agreement were terminated pursuant to the provisions of
paragraph 28(a)(ii) or 28(a)(iv), Gemini's "... obligation to repay
the amounts advanced hereunder shall be limited to repayment of the
proceeds of the sale or licensing by the [defendant] of rights in
the Work of the kind granted to the [plaintiff Random House, Inc.]
hereunder."

18. Gemini timely delivered a manuscript for Work #1 which was not,
in Random House, Inc.'s judgment, satisfactory, and Random House,
Inc. subsequently purported to exercise its right to terminate the
agreement.

19. There are no proceeds from the sale or licensing by Gemini of
rights in Work #1. Therefore, Random House. Inc. is not entitled to
repayment of any amounts advanced in respect of Work #1.

AS AND FOR A THIRD COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO THE FOURTH CAUSE
OF ACTION SET FORTH IN THE COMPLAINT

20. Gemini delivered a complete manuscript for Work #1 in a timely
manner, which manuscript did not violate common law or statutory
copyright or right of privacy of any person or contain libelous or
obscene matter, but which was not acceptable to Random House, Inc.
for publication. Pursuant to paragraph 31(a) of the Random House,
Inc. Agreement,Random House, Inc. was therefore not entitled to
repayment of the advance.

AS AND FOR A FIRST COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO THE FIFTH CAUSE
OF ACTION SET FORTH IN THE COMPLAINT

21. Gemini delivered the manuscript for Work #2 prior to September
1, 1993. By the terms of paragraph 27 of the Random House, Inc.
Agreement, the $500,000 advance allocable to Work #2 was, by reason
of such delivery, no longer "repayable."

AS AND FOR A SECOND COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO THE FIFTH CAUSE
OF ACTION SET FORTH IN THE COMPLAINT

22. Paragraph 28(d) provides that if the Random House, Inc.
Agreement is terminated pursuant to the provisions of paragraph
28(c)(ii) or 28(c)(iv), Gemini's "... obligation to repay the
amounts advanced hereunder shall be limited to repayment of the
proceeds of the sale or licensing by the [defendant] of rights in
the Work of the kind granted to the Random House, Inc.] hereunder."

23. Gemini timely delivered a manuscript for Work #2 which was not,
in Random House, Inc.'s judgment, satisfactory, and plaintiff
subsequently purported to exercise its right to terminate the
agreement.

24. There are no proceeds from the sale or licensing by defendant of
rights in Work #2. Therefore, Random House, Inc. is not entitled to
repayment of any amounts advanced in respect of Work #2.

AS AND FOR A THIRD COMPLETE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO THE FIFTH CAUSE
OF ACTION SET FORTH IN THE COMPLAINT

25. Gemini delivered a complete manuscript for Work #2 in a timely
manner, which manuscript did not violate common law or statutory
copyright or right of privacy of any person or contain libelous or
obscene matter, but which was not acceptable to Random House, Inc.
for Publication. Pursuant to paragraph 31(b) of the Random House,
Inc. Agreement, plaintiff was therefore not entitled to repayment of
the advance.

In the alternative, and without waiving its jurisdictional defenses,
Gemini respectfully alleges as its counterclaims and cross-claims:

AS AND FOR A FIRST COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST RANDOM HOUSE UK

26. At all times hereinafter mentioned, Gemini was and is a
corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of
California with a principal place of business in Los Angeles,
California.

27. On information and belief, Random House UK is a corporation
incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom, maintaining its
principal office and place of business at 20 Vauxhall Bridge Road,
London SW1V 2SA, England.

28. On or about April 25, 1988, Gemini and Random House UK entered
into an agreement providing for the publication of two untitled
novels by Joan Collins (the "First Random House UK Agreement"). In
or about May of 1990, defendant delivered the first novel written by
Joan Collins pursuant to that agreement, which was successfully
published by Random House UK.

29. In or about September 1991, Gemini delivered a manuscript for
Book 2 under the First Random Hosue UK Agreement. Random House UK
never responded to or acknowledged the delivery of that manuscript,
never edited it or provided Gemini or Joan Collins with any
editorial comments, assistance or help, and failed to publish it.

30. More than 18 months have passed since the manuscript was
delivered to Random House UK.

31. Pursuant to the First Random House UK Agreement, Gemini was to
receive additional advances as follows:

$300,000 on delivery of the completed typescript for Book 2;

$300,000 on the first publication of Book 2 in hardcover;

$300,000 on the first mass market publication of Book 2;

$300,000 six months after mass market publication of Book 2, for a
total of $1,200,000, no part of which has been paid. No demand has
been made for the payment of such sums since, in view of Random
House UK's purported cancellation of the First Random House UK
Agreement, such demand would have been futile.

32. Gemini has been damaged by Random House UK's failure to pay the
sum of $1,200,000.

AS AND FOR A SECOND COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST RANDOM HOUSE UK

33. Defendant repeats and realleges each and every allegation
contained in paragraphs 26 through 28 of the first counterclaim.

34. On or about August 28, 1990, Gemini and Random House UK entered
into an agreement providing for the publication of an untitled novel
by Joan Collins (the "Second Random House UK Agreement").

35. In or about September, 1992, Gemini delivered a manuscript
pursuant to that agreement. Random House UK never responded to or
acknowledged the delivery of that manuscript, never edited or
provided defendant or Joan Collins with any editorial comments,
assistance or help, and failed to publish it.

36. Pursuant to the Second Random House UK Agreement, Gemini was to
receive additional advances as follows:

$150,000 on delivery of the complete typescript;

$150,000 on publication or nine months after delivery;

$150,000 on publication of the paperback or twelve months after
delivery, for a total of $450,000, no part of which has been paid.
No demand has been made for the payment of such sums since, in view
of Random House UK's purported cancellation of the Second Random
House UK Agreement, such demand would have been futile.

37. Gemini has been damaged by Random House UK's failure to pay the
sum of $450,000.

AS AND FOR A FIRST CROSS-CLAIM

38. Gemini repeats and realleges each and every allegation contained
in paragraphs 26-332 and 34-37 of its counterclaims.

39. On information and belief, Lazar acted as an agent or broker in
connection with the execution of both Random House UK Agreements.

40. A portion of the advance paid to defendant Gemini in respect of
that agreement was paid to and retained by Lazar, to wit:  the sum
of $225,000 in respect of Book #2 under the First Random House UK
Agreement.

41. In the event that Gemini is required to repay to plaintiffs any
sums attributable to the Lazar commissions, it is entitled to
receive the amount thus paid from Lazar.

AS AND FOR A SECOND CROSS-CLAIM

42. Defendant Gemini repeats and realleges each and every allegation
contained in paragraphs 26-32 and 34-37 of its counterclaims and
paragraphs 39-41 of its first cross-claim.

43. Lazar never took any steps to document the submission of Work #2
or Work #3 to Random House UK, or to place plaintiff on notice of
the fact that defendant Gemini, by such delivery, considered its
obligations under the Random House UK Agreements to be complete.
Lazar also failed or omitted to demand payment from Random House UK
of the balance of the advances due under Gemini's respective
contracts with plaintiffs.

44. As Gemini's agent, Lazar was Gemini's fiduciary and owed it a
duty of care.

45. Lazar's failure to act as aforesaid represented deviation from
and a breach of its duty of care.

46. Defendant has been injured by such breach and deviation in the
sum of $1,650,000.

AS AND FOR A THIRD CROSS-CLAIM

47. Lazar acted as Gemini's agent in connection with a work known as
Prime Time. On or about March 31, 1989, Lazar received a payment
from Simon & Schuster in the sum of $347,149.84, from which sum it
deducted $34,714.98 before paying the balance to Gemini. That
deduction was improper and unwarranted, and has not been repaid
although duly demanded.

AS AND FOR A FOURTH CROSS-CLAIM

48. Lazar acted as Gemini's agent in connection with a work known as
Love & Desire, & Hate. On or about September 30, 1992, Lazar
received a payment from Simon & Schuster in the sum of $234,011.19,
from which sum it deducted $23,401.19 before paying the balance to
Gemini. That deduction was improper and unwarranted, and has not
been repaid although duly demanded.

WHEREFORE, defendant Gemini Star Productions Ltd. demands judgment:

1. Dismissing the complaint for want of personal and subject matter
jurisdiction, and that plaintiffs take nothing thereby; or, in the
alternative

2. Dismissing the complaint on the merits; and

3. On its first counterclaim in the sum of $1,200,000 against
plaintiff Random House UK Limited;

4. On its second counterclaim in the sum of $450,000 against
plaintiff Random House UK Limited;

5. On its first cross-claim against defendant Lazar in the sum of
$225,000;

6. On its second cross-claim against defendant Lazar in the sum of
$1,650,000; and

7. On its third cross-claim against defendant Lazar in the sum of
$34,714.98, together with interest from March 31, 1989; and

8. On its fourth cross-claim against defendant Lazar in the sum of
$23,401.19, together with interest from September 30, 1992; and

9. The costs and disbursements of this action.

which was "So Ordered" on August 22, 1994 by the Hon. Lewis L.
Stanto., consenting to the service and filing of this Second
Verified Amended Complaint to join those claims previously brought
by plaintiff Random House, Inc. against defendants in an action
entitled Random House. Inc. v. Gemini Star Productions Ltd., Joan
Collins and Irving Paul Lazar, 99 Civ. 0657 (LLS), United States
District Court, Southern District of New York. A copy of the
stipulation is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

2. Joinder of the federal claims in this action is now appropriate
and timely by reason of the opinion and order of the United States
District Court dated April 19, 1995.

JURISDICITON

3. At all times hereinafter mentioned, plaintiff Random House UK was
and still is incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom,
maintaining its principal office and place of business at 20
Vauxhall Bridge Road, London SW IV 2 SA, England.

4. At all times hereinafter mentioned, plaintiff Random House, Inc.
was and still is a domestic corporation, with its principal
executive offices at 201 East 50th Street, New York, New York 10022.

5. Upon information and belief, defendant Gemini Star Productions
Limited ("Gemini") is a corporation organized under the laws of the
State of California with its principal place of business in Los
Angeles, California.

6. At all times hereinafter mentioned, defendant Gemini has
individually and also through its agent, defendant Irving Paul Lazar
Agency ("Lazar"), transacted business in New York within the meaning
of Section 302(a)(1) of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of the
State of New York; and, thus, this court has in personam
jurisdiction over Gemini.

7. Upon information and belief, defendant Joan Collins ("Collins")
is a resident of England.

8. At all times hereinafter mentioned, defendant Collins has in
person, and through her agent, Lazar, and other agents, transacted
business in New York within the meaning of Section 302(a)(1) of the

of the New York courts by reason of the fact that Gemini asserted a
counterclaim against Random House UK relating to the Second Random
House UK Agreement (see Gemini's Answer, Counterclaims and
Cross-claims dated June 9, 1994) and that counterclaim is unrelated
to the claims asserted by Random House UK in its original complaint
dated May 20, 1994.

FACTS
First Random House UK Agreement

13. On or about April 25, 1988, Century Hutchinson Limited (which
was acquired by Random House UK in 1989), as Publisher, entered into

("the First Random House UK Agreement" with Gemini, as Author, for
the British publication rights to two untitled novels by Collins
(referred to as "Book 1" and "Book 2").

14. Random House UK and Gemini intended that the First Random House
UK Agreement benefit Lazar and thus Lazar is a third party
beneficiary under the First Random House UK Agreement. The intent to
benefit Lazar is evidenced by Paragraph 27 of the First Random House
UK Agreement which provides as follows:

It is agreed by and between [Random House UK], Gemini Star
Productions Ltd. and/or Joan Collins that all monies due under this
Agreement should be paid to [Lazar] whose receipt shall be a valid
discharge of the monies received and [Lazar] is hereby empowered by
[Gemini] to conduct negotiations with [Random House UK] in respect
of all matters arising in any way out of this Agreement.

Lazar Agreement

15. The Random Century Group Limited (Random House UK was named "The
Random Century Group Limited" from November 1989 to May 1992, when
the company name was changed to "Random House UK Limited"), entered
into an agreement with Lazar dated January 10, 1991 (the "Lazar
Agreement").

16. Pursuant to the Lazar Agreement, Lazar acknowledged receipt of
the sum of $225,000 representing the agent's commission under the
First Random House UK Agreement for Book 2

17. The Lazar Agreement also provides that:

In the event Joan Collins fails to deliver the manuscript for the
Untitled Novel as provided for under the provisions of Clause 2 of
the Agreement [between Random House UK and Gemini dated April 25,
1988] or the Agreement for the Untitled Novel is terminated under
the provisions of Clause 9 of the Agreement then in either of these
events you or your successors and assigns agree to repay the
$225,000.

Second Random House UK Agreement

18. On or about August 28, 1990, Random Century Group Limited, as
Publisher, entered into a written agreement ("the Second Random
House UK Agreement") with Gemini, as Author, for the British
publication rights to one untitled novel by Collins (hereinaf~ter
referred to as "Book 3").

Agreement"), for the publication of two untitled novels by Joan
Collins (referred to as Work #1 and Work #2).

20. Paragraph 45 of the Random House, Inc. Agreement (at Page 4 of

has a 10% interest in any and all monies payable under the Agreement
to the account of defendant Gemini.

Agreement and that Lazar "acknowledges that such payments of the
agent's commission constitute a portion of the total advance to

COUNTY OF NEW YORK

ROBERT M. CALLAGY, being duly sworn, deposes and says: that he is
admitted to practice in the State of New York and is a partner in

plaintiff Random House UK Limited in this action, and that the

<H3>Model Policy on Alternative Work Schedules for Attorneys</h3><p>

1. Purpose:<p>

The firm [FN1] recognizes that an attorney should be permitted to work a
flexible or reduced work schedule for reasons related to child-rearing.
The firm believes that the availability of alternative scheduling
opportunities for child-rearing purposes is necessary to promote the
full participation in the firm of attorneys with significant
responsibility for the care of natural, adopted or foster children.
Additionally, the firm believes that the availability of such
alternative scheduling opportunities will benefit both the firm and its
clients by facilitating the recruitment of new attorneys and the
retention of experienced attorneys.<p>

2. Statement of Professional Responsibility:<p>

The firm expects that an attorney working an alternative work schedule,
just as an attorney working a regular full-time work schedule, will be
flexible in his or her hours so as to provide quality and timely
services to clients consistent with the area of practice and level of
responsibility of the attorney involved. The firm and the attorney
working an alternative work schedule recognize that a high standard of
professionalism and client loyalty must be maintained.<p>

3. Alternative Work Schedules:<p>

Numerous creative and flexible work schedules can be developed to meet
the varied requirements of different practice settings and different
parenting situations. Attorneys and their supervisors should feel free
to create the most mutually advantageous arrangement possible. It is
important to both the attorneys and the firm that attorneys on
alternative work schedules perform work commensurate with their
experience and skills. Arrangements that promote the competent and
efficient performance of the appropriate level of work are
encouraged.<p>

The following are among the alternative work schedules that will be
considered:<p>

a. Flextime: An attorney continues to work a full-time schedule, but has
some flexibility to choose when such at torney fulfills his or her work
obligations.<p>

b. Part Time: An attorney works a reduced schedule.<p>

c. Job Sharing: Two part-time attorneys share one full-time position.<p>

d. Flexiplace: An attorney has the option to work at home, in a branch
office or in another off-site work setting. The attorney will be linked
to the office by telephone and/or by computers, facsimile machines and
voice mail.<p>

Where it is feasible, the firm welcomes proposals for sharing of
offices, secretaries, workload, and other applicable arrangements.<p>

4. Eligibility:<p>

Any attorney with the firm may apply for an alternative work schedule
for child-rearing purposes. Requests for alternative work schedules for
reasons other than child- rearing and requests for alternative work
schedules by attorney applicants for employment will be considered on a
case-by-case basis.<p>

5. Application process: <p>

An attorney requesting an alternative work schedule should submit a
proposal to the firm as much in advance as possible. The firm shall
respond to the request promptly.<p>

6. Criteria for acceptance:<p>

A presumption exists that requests for alternative scheduling
arrangements related to child-rearing will be granted if the attorney is
in good standing with the firm and if the request can be reasonably
accommodated by the practice group or groups which will be directly
affected.<p>

7. Compensation:<p>

a. Salary: The compensation of associate attorneys on a reduced schedule
shall be determined as follows:<p>

i. An associate attorney shall be paid a salary on a pro rata basis
based on the number of billable and non-billable hours to be worked
compared to the number of billable and non- billable hours that the
associate would be expected to work if working full time at the firm.<p>

ii. If an associate attorney on a reduced schedule in fact works
substantially more or less than the proportional number of hours
expected, or substantially more or less than the proportional number of
hours actually worked by full time associate attorneys in the firm, then
the salary paid to the reduced schedule attorney shall be adjusted
accordingly.<p>

b. Benefits: The firm will provide health insurance coverage to all
attorneys on an alternative work schedule. The attorney may be required
to contribute to the cost of such coverage on a pro rata basis. All
other benefits (including vacation and sick leave) will be provided on a
prorated basis.<p>

Compensation of partners on a reduced work schedule will be determined
based upon similar principles.<p>

8. Effect on partnership:<p>

Working an alternative work schedule shall not affect eligibility of an
associate attorney to be considered for partnership. However, a
reduction in the amount, duration and quality of experience as a result
of less than full-time practice may extend the time to partnership.<p>

9. Evaluation:<p>

Each alternative work schedule arrangement will be reviewed and
evaluated by the firm and the attorney at least annually. At this time
consideration may be given, if necessary, to compensation or work
schedule adjustments required by an economic analysis of the alternative
work schedule arrangement for the period under review.<p>

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO

Criminal Action No. 96-CR-68

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Plaintiff,

vs.

TIMOTHY JAMES McVEIGH and TERRY LYNN NICHOLS,
Defendants.

REPORTER'S TRANSCRIPT

(VOLUME IX - SUPPRESSION HEARING and HEARING ON MOTIONS)

Proceedings before the HONORABLE RICHARD P. MATSCH,
Judge, United States District Court for the District of
Colorado, commencing at 9:00 a.m., on the 15th day of July,
1996, in Courtroom C-204, United States Courthouse, Denver,
Colorado.

Proceeding Recorded by Mechanical Stenography, Transcription
Produced via Computer by Paul Zuckerman, 1929 Stout Street,
P.O. Box 3563, Denver, Colorado, 80294, (303) 629-9285


THE COURT:  Well, I'm taking this motion under
advisement.  I think I have to consider both the suppression
and this together.  Obviously, they're connected.

The issue of compliance with the new legislation for
closed circuit television transmission of trial proceedings to
Oklahoma City is the next issue.  The Government filed its
motion on this.  Defendants filed their respective objections
and the Government reply; so we've got extensive briefing on
this as well.  I indicated that we would give some time for
argument here simply on the question of the constitutionality
of this provision, recognizing, of course, that the actual
application of it requires further consideration and what
conditions and what the methodology is and all that has to be

considered; but we're ready to go on the objections that have
been raised that include the arguments with respect to
separation of powers, bill of attainder, Fifth and Sixth
Amendments, and the like.

I'll hear any supplement to the brief by argument if
you wish to make it.  Mr. Tigar, I see you rising for that
purpose, I presume.

DEFENDANT NICHOLS' ARGUMENT ON CLOSED CIRCUIT TRANSMISSION

MR. TIGAR:  Yes, your Honor.  I'll not repeat what we
said in the brief about statutory interpretation.

This statute caught us by surprise.  There are those
in New York that Nicholas Pileggi calls "wise guys" who dream
of a racetrack in which the numbers are put on the horses after
the race is run.  We made -- that's how we feel.  We made an
argument to your Honor at the change of venue hearing that was
directed at moving the case to Denver, and in that I
consciously made a decision that we would not seek a change of
venue to places that we thought might be even better for us in
terms of jury selection.  I had already spoken to two district
judges in the Ninth Circuit who had approached me about trying
the case in San Francisco or Seattle -- that was at the Ninth
Circuit judicial conference; but if your Honor will recall, I
was conscious of the fact that a United States attorney was
going to make a presentation about the rights of victims and so
we decided to try to head that off by seeking a venue that, as

I said in argument, was a reasonable short air flight from
Oklahoma City; that is to say, Denver, where the transportation
facilities would accommodate those interests.  And the Court
will recall that the United States Attorney made a tearful and
empassioned speech with respect to victims' rights.

So after we had done that, after we made all our
arguments, after we're committed, the Congress goes and passes
this statute.  Why does this statute violate the Constitution?
First, it violates the equal protection clause as that is
construed in Romer vs. Evans, 116 Supreme Court 1620.  The
wonderful thing about Romer and Justice Kennedy's opinion is
that it tells us that equal protection of the laws is not
achieved through indiscriminate imposition of inequalities;
that the desire to harm an unpopular group cannot constitute a
legitimate governmental suppress.

This statute is like the constitutional provision
declared invalid in Romer; that is to say, it is impossible to
believe that this statute has any purpose other than hostility
to the proclaimed desire of these defendants to have a trial
free from the diversion of television cameras.  This statute,
unless that purpose be the other one, of contradicting what
your Honor had said; that is to say, a resolute desire to
enforce the provisions of Federal Rule 53, which the Tenth
Circuit has just this week told us -- just last week told us
means exactly what it says and what your Honor says it says.

The statute, in addition to having no legitimate
governmental purpose, is utterly irrational.  First, it burdens
the defendant who seeks an interstate change of venue, although
movement from one state to another penalizing that is itself
suspect under the equal protection clause.  It doesn't burden
the defendant who wants a change of venue from Beaumont to El
Paso, a distance of 888 miles.  It doesn't burden a defendant
who wants a change of venue, indeed, within a single district
from Austin to El Paso, 683 miles, San Antonio to El Paso,
560 miles.  It doesn't burden a defendant who wants a change of
venue from Redding, a place for holding court, to Los Angeles,
546; Redding to San Diego, 690.

At the same time, your Honor, by saying that the out
of state must be matched with the 350 miles, of course, had I
known that the cost -- the cost to my client would have been by
seeking a change more than 350 miles -- would have been we had
to have television, well, your Honor, there are some other
venues I could have had out of state.  The last case Mr. Woods
and I tried a verdict was in Tarrant County, your Honor --
that's Fort Worth -- and our client was acquitted.  Senator
Hutchison.  A Terrin County jury would be just fine for us; an
Amarillo jury, your Honor, Judge Mary Lou Robinson; a Lubbock
jury, Judge, Cummings, less than 350 miles, and that's a choice
that we could have made.

But the statute -- see, the statute, first it says out

of state.  Now, the out of state part we show is irrational
because the fact is that within single states, you can have
enormous distances and enormous differences that are based on
those as between east and west Texas.  By putting in the
350 miles, the statute also makes no sense because 350 miles
can be exceeded by an intrastate transfer, and a distance of
350 miles has nothing whatever to do with the relative
convenience of air transport; that is to say it is as
inconvenient to get from Oklahoma City to Fort Worth as it is
to get from Oklahoma City to Denver.

The statute makes no sense.  The classification it
establishes makes no sense.  It denies these defendants,
therefore, the equal protection of the laws.  And what equal
protection means is the protection that Rule 53 was in its
inception and in the consistent course of Judicial Conference
decision designed to confirm.

It is a protection which we cited in our brief to the
Tenth Circuit that was a part of their mandamus decision noting
that Rule 53 has been carried into effect in district after
district, including this one, by an express prohibition not
only upon cameras in the courtroom, but upon the sort of
studied evasion that the press was attempting to do and that
your Honor wisely put a stop to.

So that is the point, your Honor.  We cited Romer vs. 
Evans to the court, and we cited Yik Wo; but Justice Kennedy's
opinion, when read, I think makes our argument more eloquently
than we could in our papers and, certainly, more fully than we
did.

With respect to separation of powers, were the power
of judging joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of
the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control.  That's what
Madison wrote in The Federalist No. 47.  And he cited
Montesquieu's Spirit of the Law, a treatise that was well known
to the framers of the Constitution and which as has indeed, if
Westlaw is correct, been cited some 13 times since 1945 in
Supreme Court opinions dealing with separation of powers.

It is not, however, simply the abstract concern with
separation of powers that motivates our argument.  The fact is
that all defense counsel had said that they did not want to
risk a repeat of some media circus in this case no matter what
the controls; so our position was clear.

Your Honor -- and I can recall it clearly -- had a
shouted question that came at him in the Oklahoma City airport
and had said that Rule 53 would be observed.  A significant
observation.  I don't think a controversial ones.  All courts
that have looked at these matters, even in highly publicized
matters, have said that Rule 53 means what it says.

And so this legislation was designed to tell your
Honor, Judge Matsch, This is the Article I Congress people.
Hello, Article III Judge; this is how you're supposed to decide

the particular issue that is before you.  Oh, and by the way,
Judge Matsch, says the Congress, do that after the defendants
have taken a position in reliance upon the law as it stood.

That, if the Court please, is directly contrary to the
teaching of Plaut, it's directly contrary to the teaching of
Klein.

The Government's response is interesting.  I made the
statutory interpretation argument in part because I believe
that having drafted the statute, the Government has to live by
it.  The thorns which they have reaped are of the tree they
planted; however, I also knew that the Government would come
back and tell your Honor, as it predictably did, don't read the
text of the statute.  The text of the statute is only relevant
when the legislative history is vague.  That's not the way I
learned the rule, but let's take the Government at its word.

The legislative history, say they, was designed to
tell your Honor, and Article III judge, exactly how to rule on
a pending issue in this case.  And so the Government, in
seeking to avoid the thrust of one of our arguments, has
impaled itself upon the other.  That, it seems to me, makes
inescapable the conclusion that this legislation is invalid for
those reasons.

And I turn finally, then, to the due process concern,
which is slightly different from the equal protection concern
but based on the same idea.  All of us in this case have

striven, with a little mutual recrimination, to be sure -- but
all of us have striven in the best way that we can to keep from
making this case into a media circus.  I think that we have
been conscious of our professional obligations, although some
of us have seen fit to do -- to try to discharge them
differently; but the fact is we've all tried to do it.

And what we get for that is a declaration that this
courtroom is to be subject to the paraphernalia of cameras,
something that helps to turn the courtroom into something that
the Supreme Court warned against in Estes vs. Texas and
something that will make it much more difficult to have the
atmosphere of dispassionate judgment that all of us here at one
time or another have at least professed to want.

Moreover, the dangers attendant upon peopling -- or
having the courtroom filled with microphones are ones to which
I need not avert.  They are ones that we averted to in our
filing in the Tenth Circuit with respect to mandamus and which
I think it is clear that the Tenth Circuit, following your
Honor's lead, has already told us are of sufficient weight to
have led that court to deny the mandamus last week and uphold
your Honor's position.

For all of those reasons -- and since your Honor
invited me to talk about the Constitution, I've done it -- but
plus my insistence that the text of this statute means what it
says, as the Supreme Court has often told us.  We ask that the

Government's motion be denied.

THE COURT:  Mr. Jones, are you speaking to this?

DEFENDANT MCVEIGH'S ARGUMENT ON CLOSED CIRCUIT TRANSMISSION

MR. JONES:  May it please the Court, your Honor, when
the Constitutional Convention finished its work in Philadelphia
and it required for its labors to bear fruit that nine of the
twelve states must ratify it -- and, of course, we recall that
New York was the pivotal state -- three of the members of the
convention, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton and John Jay,
wrote a series of essays that we have come to know as The 
Federalist Papers in an attempt to persuade the legislature of
the State of New York to ratify the Constitution.  And the
heart of those Federalist Papers is, of course, No. 10; and in
Federalist Paper No. 10, Madison and Hamilton and Jay set forth
and addressed the principal concern that must have been in the
minds of rural legislators in deciding whether to ratify the
Constitution, and that is just how powerful would the new
Federal Government be.

And they assured their audience that the new
Constitution had within it two basic fundamental principles
that would forever guide the new government and serve as a
protection.  The first of those was the concept of federalism,
divided authority between the federal and state governments;
but the second one is the one that Mr. Tigar references, and
that is the separation of powers.  In fact, Mr. Madison in

writing that particular essay went on to say the very heart of
the machine to preserve liberty is to be found in the
separation of powers.

Now, the issue before the Court cannot be one that the
Court would invite.  We're all familiar, we learned it in the
first week in law school, that courts strive to avoid declaring
an act unconstitutional.  If there is some way to save the
legislation, it is to be saved.  If it is unconstitutional but
its inapplicability can be determined on other grounds, courts
prefer that.  And in some respect, I think that even arguing
with this issue today is a vain and useless thing because from
the state of the technology, I think it is clear that when we
have the hearing -- if, in fact, there is one -- that the
requirements that Congress passed on the security of the signal
will be found wanting.  If hackers can break into computers and
signals of missile ranges and city electrical systems and all
of the other things that we know occur, they can certainly
break into this one.

But that's not the issue before us today.  And this
issue really doesn't affect the guilt or innocence of the
defendants; and it might seem to be a peripheral issue, but it
isn't.  It goes at the very heart of the type of government
that we have.

And we are asking the Court to do something that
probably less than 50 federal judges in the entire history of

this country -- that is, below the Supreme Court level -- have
done, which is to declare an act of the Congress passed almost
2 to 1 and signed into law by the President of the United
States to be unconstitutional.  All the more difficult a
challenge and invitation to this court, because this statute is
aimed at your Honor.  It's not only aimed at your Honor, it's
aimed at a specific act that your Honor undertook on
February 27 when you announced, as Mr. Tigar said, that there
would be no television broadcasting from this courtroom.  And
in April, Congress decided to overrule your Honor.  And if
there is any doubt that they had specifically in mind
overruling your Honor and talked about your Honor's ruling on
the floor of the Congress, it can be found in the daily issues
of The Congressional Record, and I'll be glad to give you the
citation.

That is why we say -- and I am not going to repeat
what's in the brief.  We talk about those lofty principles --
and they are lofty -- bill of attainder and ex post facto and
separation of powers.  But there can be no more clear example
of the interference with the judiciary's independence,
authority, and authority than to take a decision that your
Honor has made and overturn it by legislation.  Not that your
Honor's decision was wrong.  Rule 53 is clear.  Your Honor's
decision was correct.  And we invite the Court to find the
gloss on Rule 53 that Justice Frankfurter found in the

Youngstown Sauer case involving the seizure of the steel mills
by President Truman in 1952; that the Judicial Conference and
the judiciary and Supreme Court have spoken so consistently and
so uniformly in an unbroken record of 60 years that there will
be no broadcasting of criminal federal -- federal criminal
trials; that somewhere along the line that had to pass into an
area uniquely controlled by the judiciary.

And as I have elsewhere, and I say it with all
friendship for Congressman Lucas, a friend of mine -- and I've
contributed to his campaigns and plan to do so again, have
entertained him in my house; but he can no more tell you to put
a television in this courtroom than you can tell him to put a
television in his office.

It surely needs no elaboration.  This is a political
decision made by politicians who sought to seize the moment,
and not even most of the victims asked for it.

So all of those reasons why we don't permit television
cameras which are summarized at 381 U.S. 540 through 551 in
Estes vs. Texas are applicable to the very issue here.  But
specifically, there are four points -- and I'll just mention
them very briefly -- that trouble us about this act as applied
to this case.  I won't go into the one that Mr. Tigar did
except to say that, of course, it does discourage and burden
change of venue motions that defendants must file.  But leaving
that aside, there are four others.

First, of course, there is no provision in this
statute for the public and no provision for the families of the
defendants, who certainly are inconvenienced through no fault
of their own and have a compelling interest in attending this
trial.  But if we read the language of the statute itself, it
does not apply to this case for the reasons initially submitted
by Mr. Tigar, because it only applies where there is an out of
state change in which the case was initially brought -- which
clearly that is satisfied -- more than 350 miles from the
location in which those proceedings originally would have taken
place.

Well, the antecedent for the clause those proceedings
originally would have taken place is the trial.  This trial was
never scheduled for Oklahoma City.  It has been scheduled only
in Lawton, Oklahoma and moved here.  So even if there is a
signal to be sent back, it has to be sent back to Lawton.
There is no court order, no minute, no determination that this
trial would ever be held in Oklahoma City.

Secondly, I adopt the argument Mr. Tigar made in his
brief that under the plain wording of this statute, not even
the 350-mile requirement is met.  This statute requires the
Court already burdened with the motions and the trial
preparation to do three other things that it ordinarily would
not have to do.  Actually, four.  First, the Court must
determine the location.  Secondly, it has to determine those

persons who have a compelling interest in doing so and are
otherwise unable to do so by reason of inconvenience and
expense.  So that's the second and third finding the Court has
to make.

And the Court has a fourth finding, and that is under
paragraph 2, that you must determine for each of those
individuals whether the testimony by that person, if they
testified at trial, would be materially affected if that person
heard other testimony at the trial.

We do not know how many people will seek to avail
themselves of these proceedings; but if the public statements
are correct that just the core, to use an overworked expression
today, victims of 2200 -- let's just say that a fourth of them
sought to avail themselves of this statute, the Court would
have to determine the status of 550 people and the legislation
gives no guidance to the Court whether it's an adversarial
process, whether there is a public hearing, whether we have the
right to challenge any of those people or whether Mr. Nichols
has the right or, for that matter, the Government.

But let us suppose that there are more than 500.
Let's suppose there is 5,000.  We're going to have a Yankee
Stadium setting much like the early days of Fidel Castro's
republic with a giant television screen in which there will be
several thousand, certainly several hundred people that might
want to go there.  And we all know that there are a certain

number of people that follow the firetruck to every fire.
There are large number of people in this case who have sought
to involve themselves in it, inappropriately so.

So how many of them are going to try to take advantage
of this and come down and have their 15 minutes of fame or
7 1/2 minutes of fame to show that they're entitled to watch
this?  Because they have a claim?

And I'm not referring to those people -- I don't call
them victims, I call them survivors.  I think that's what they
are and how they should be addressed who obviously have a very
real and personal interest in attending these proceedings.  But
there is no way to work that to their exclusion -- I mean only
to their inclusion.

Finally, there is another provision in this statute
that is carefully drawn, which is very troublesome and that is
the provision that says nothing in this section shall be
construed -- and then it goes down to the second what I call
double little (i), to provide any person with a defense in any
action in which application of this section is made.

I have read the entire legislative history and could
not find a single word in the Congressional debate or the
conference committee report that interpreted that section; so I
have to take it at its face value.  And plainly what they're
trying to do is to prevent us from raising an Estes vs. Texas
argument on appeal.  Having overruled your Honor and having

told you that you have to do it, if our client or Mr. Tigar's
client is convicted, we can't raise that on appeal and that is
the only issue upon which Mr. Estes got certiorari and got his
conviction overturned.

So we respectfully submit to the Court that although
this statute was introduced, I think, for blatant political
purposes and in this case plays out against those on both sides
and although many of the survivors have a legitimate concern
and interest in this legislation, that in the final analysis,
the truth of the matter is that this bar right here separates
us from the mob.  This side of the bar is the sanctuary in the
jungle that Mr. Tigar talked about at the change of venue
hearing; and anyone who doubts that with the slightest
encouragement or inattention that that bar would be pushed down
and that the vigilante system of justice would pervade this
case simply does not understand what is at issue.

And in the final analysis, the only person, as Learned
Hand says, that protects us in the spirit of liberty is the
trial court.  It's your Honor.  You either shut the door or you
open the door; and in this case, all of us know why this
statute was passed.  All of us know what is the issue here; and
there must be -- and I submit there is in the brief -- adequate
reason to declare it either unconstitutional or inapplicable as
poorly written to the facts of this case.

THE COURT:  Who speaks for the Government on this?

Somebody other than Mr. Connelly.

MS. BEHENNA:  We decided to give him a rest for a
moment.

THE COURT:  All right.

PLAINTIFF'S ARGUMENT ON CLOSED CIRCUIT TRANSMISSION

MS. BEHENNA:  Thank you, your Honor.

With the Court's ruling earlier, I will not discuss
the implementation problems that Mr. Jones just raised.

THE COURT:  That's right.

MS. BEHENNA:  I will narrow this to the constitutional
challenges raised by the defendants in this case.  Mr. Jones
made a comment that the victims have a legitimate interest in
this case.  I submit to the Court that they have a statutory
right to view these criminal proceedings.  In 1990, Congress
enacted the Victims -- let me get the correct name here -- the
Victims Compensation and Assistance Act.  In that act, Congress
recognized certain rights of victims of crime.  One of those
rights was to declare victims to have the right to view, to be
present at all criminal proceedings in matters.

That interest --

THE COURT:  Well, they have the right to be notified
of them.

MS. BEHENNA:  The statute provides they have the right
to be present, your Honor.

THE COURT:  Well, read that to me.

MS. BEHENNA:  It states specifically at Item No. 4,
rights of victims:  A crime victim has the following
rights . . .  No. 4, the right to be present at all public
court proceedings relating to the offense unless the court
determines that the testimony of a victim would be --" and
that's the 615 issue that the Court has previously raised.

THE COURT:  All right.

MS. BEHENNA:  That was provided for in 1990, long
before the antiterrorism bill that was the subject of Section
235.

The interest that Congress has in providing for rights
of victims was well recognized.  Under an equal protection
challenge, your Honor, the Court must determine, if in fact, it
finds the defendants are part of a suspect group or that
Section 235 of the antiterrorism bill somehow burdens a
fundamental right of the defendants -- the Court must find that
there was no legitimate state interest in providing for the
victims in this case; and I submit to the Court that that is
not true.

Congress has a substantial interest in providing for
the victims which began, as I mentioned earlier, in the 1990
enactment of the Victims Compensation Assistance Act.  That
interest in providing for the rights of victims was continued
in the 1996 legislation providing for closed circuit TV for
victims.  It provides nothing more than expanding this
courtroom in situations where venue is changed outside a state
to a distance of more than 350 miles from the district where
the crime occurred.

As such, your Honor, it no more burdens a fundamental
right of the defendant, nor does it -- nor is it irrationally
related to some legitimate Congressional end.  In fact, as I
mentioned before, in fact, it is rationally related in a
rationale for the previous enactments that Congress has
enacted.

With regard to the separation of powers issue, your
Honor, in Plaut vs. Spendthrift -- I can't even talk --
Spendthrift Farms, the Supreme Court specifically identified
two types of legislation that is -- by Congress that it is an
unlawful intrusion to the judicial branch.  One of those types
is where Congress attempts to tell the Court how to rule in a
case pending before it.  Specifically, the Supreme Court said
it is unlawful for Congress to try and legislate in an area
that annuls a final judgment in a pending case.  I submit to
the Court that there is no final judgment in this case with
regard to the closed circuit TV issue.

In fact, there is no invasion by the enactment of
Section 235.  Congress has always reserved the right to be able
to manage criminal federal trials.  Specifically, they have the
right to legislate rules of evidence, they have the right to
legislate sentencing provisions, and so forth.

The fact that Congress felt it necessary to provide
for closed circuit TV in this situation is no more than
managing a criminal trial, which the Congress already has the
right to do.

The final argument raised by these defendants has to
do with the broadcast and the prohibition under Rule 53.
Continuously, the defendants argue that closed circuit
television is unlawfully intruding into Rule 53 by telling this
court that it has to provide closed circuit TV after -- in
violation of Rule 53, which says that cameras in the courtroom.

Your Honor, I submit to the Court that the private
broadcasts by closed circuit TV to the victims in Oklahoma City
do not come to the level of an Estes vs. Texas public broadcast
of criminal proceedings.  It is to a very limited group for a
very specific purpose.  There is no violation in this case.
There is no concern that somehow there will be a public
broadcast of these proceedings which would interfere with the
defendants' right to a fair trial.  Such being the case, the
analysis under the right to a fair trial, I submit to the
Court, is wanting.

Your Honor, having stated this, Congress does have a
legitimate interest in providing for the rights of victims to
be present during criminal proceedings; and noting that there
is in separation of powers problem because the judicial branch
or the Congress did not try to impermissibly invade the

judicial branch, Section 235 does nothing more than extend this
courtroom to the victims in Oklahoma City, an audience which
Congress has already determined has a right to be present
during the criminal proceedings and to view these proceedings.

Such being the case, your Honor, the constitutional
challenges raised by the defendants to Section 235 are not
real, they're not substantial, and they do not weigh this
statute and make it fail on constitutional grounds.

Any problems with the implementation of this statute
regarding how many cameras, how many microphones, where they
are going to be placed, are all issues that can be decided
amongst the parties with the Court at sometime in the future.
If the statute is constitutional on its face, which it is, your
Honor, the Court must uphold Section 235 and provide closed
circuit TV for viewing of the victims in Oklahoma City.

Thank you.

THE COURT:  Any rebuttal on this?

MR. TIGAR:  Briefly.  Very briefly.

THE COURT:  All right.

DEFENDANT NICHOLS' REBUTTAL ARGUMENT 
ON CLOSED CIRCUIT TRANSMISSION

MR. TIGAR:  Very briefly, your Honor.  The argument
that all the statute does is expand the courtroom is the same
argument that Mr. Kelley made on behalf of the press:  All he
wanted to do was expand the courtroom. The problem is that
this form of expansion is regarded as significant.

With respect to the equal protection challenge, if the
statute's purpose is to protect the rights of victims who would
have difficulty getting to a trial, then it is seriously under-
inclusive for equal protection purposes because the only
criminal trial in the United States that it could possibly
apply to is this one.  It would be hard to name another one
that it could actually now or in the future potentially apply
to.  And it does not apply, which proves its under-
inclusiveness to intrastate changes of venue, which, as I told
the Court, could be more than several hundred miles.

With respect to the Congress' power, we quoted the
language from United States vs. Klein.  Klein is a case in
which there was not a final judgment.  There had been a trial
court judgment.  It was on appeal.  The court said, What is
this but to prescribe a rule for the decision of a cause in a
particular case; i.e. in which a judgment tentatively entered
had not yet become final?

So for all of those reasons, your Honor, we
respectfully suggest that the statute fails as a constitutional
matter.

RULING ON CLOSED CIRCUIT TRANSMISSION

THE COURT:  Well, on this I'm prepared to rule and do
so.  And of course, my focus at the moment is simply on whether
the statute -- Section 235 is invalid on its face.  And my
ruling is that it is not.

With respect to the particular challenges and my
reasoning in support of this ultimate conclusion, I think it's
an overstatement to say, as the Government has just said, that
the Congress has the power to manage criminal trials.  It
doesn't.  It has the power to prescribe rules that the courts
must apply in criminal trials as well as to prescribe
sentencing and sentencing procedures.

I look at this statute not as requiring television
broadcasting.  That's not the issue.  What it is in my reading
is an amendment to Rule 53 and in a sense a proviso or
exception to the general prohibition of broadcasting contained
in Rule 53.

Now, is it special legislation?  As of the moment of
its enactment, obviously, this is the criminal proceeding that
the Congress had in mind; but it is not, in my judgment,
restricted to this case and might have applicability in the
future.  I don't know.

But Congress does have the power to pass the Rules of
Criminal Procedure as it does to pass rules of evidence.
Generally speaking, it's done in a cooperative way under the
Rules Enabling Act with the participation of the advisory
committees of the Judicial Conference, the Supreme Court, and
then Congress; but this is not the first time that Congress has
exercised its power without going through those other

procedures.  It's done so on several occasions with respect to
rules of evidence and most recently Rule 413, I believe.

Does it violate the separation of powers?  In my
judgment, it does not.  This does not constitute, as I
interpret the statute, an incursion on the judicial power of
this court, nor does it interfere with the decisional authority
of this court with respect to adjudication issues that are, of
course, the responsibility of the trial court.

So this matter is not a part of the adjudicative
process.

With respect to whether it constitutes a bill of
attainder because it impacts particularly on these defendants,
it doesn't fit the definition of bill of attainder that has
been made in the Supreme Court and other courts, because this
is not punishment.  It's referred in the papers here as
subjecting the defendants to the perils and penalties of
telecasting, but this is not going to be telecasting in the
sense of Estes and Chandler.

For the same reason, it's not ex post facto
legislation because it is not prescribing punishment.  And of
course, I intend to see that application of the statute in no
way affects the rights of the defendants in fundamental
fairness.

That gets us to the fifth and Sixth Amendment
arguments, due process under the Fifth, the fundamental fair

trial requirements of the Sixth Amendment; and of course,
counsel for the accused have presented this possible parade of
horribles about what can happen at a trial with television
cameras and microphones and directors and zoom lens and all of
those kinds of things.

Well, it's not going to be like that.  The statute
says very clearly -- and this is also one of the reasons why I
think it doesn't violate separation of powers.  The statute
specifically provides that the signal shall be under the
court's control at all times and shall only be transmitted
subject to the terms and conditions imposed by the court.  And
in this case, there will be certainly a number of those
restrictions.

With respect to the Court's burden to determine who
views or who has the opportunity to view the television
transmission, that is, of course, something that has to be
decided; and the parties have the right to participate in that
process.

Now, the Congressional purpose has the recitation that
this is for victims, but the statute doesn't speak to victims.
It says such persons the Court determines have a compelling
interest in doing so and are otherwise unable to do so by
reason of the inconvenience and expense caused by the change of
convenience.  So compelling purpose is not limited to victims
or survivors.  That's something that needs interpretation.  And
we'll be doing that.

Reception of the signal is to be limited here.  And
the Government in its motion has suggested that it be to a
courtroom configured as a courtroom and subject to monitoring
and controls of a courtroom in the receiving place, just as
with the transmission place, the place of trial.  And that is
what I'm suggesting.

What is the effect on the transmitting court, this
courtroom?  Well, I can tell you that we're -- what I have in
mind.  There would be no visible television camera.  A camera
can be placed in the wall with a port that is not obtrusive;
and also, we don't need a director, a program director because
what the statute speaks to, in my judgment, is to give the
persons at the remote place -- that is, the receiving place --
the same opportunity to see the trial proceedings as the
persons who are present in the courtroom where the trial
proceedings are taking place.  And that, to me, means that they
ought to have something that is the equivalent of a person
seated here in the courtroom in the public area.  So to my
mind, that means a fixed focus, a panoramic view, if you will,
a view of the well of the court, not the jury, probably, and
no -- no movement of the camera, no focusing on speakers or
witnesses or anybody else.  You see the whole scene.  That's
what I call panoramic view.  I don't know what the people in
the business might call it.

With respect to what impact this might have, the
awareness that this television signal transmission is taking
place and it's being viewed by someone else, of course, with
respect to a jury, it would be a subject of voir dire inquiry
as to whether persons who are being considered for service on
this jury would be influenced by that fact.  That can be taken
care of in voir dire.

With respect to its influence on the Court, I'll pass
on that.  I don't believe that's a problem.

With respect to its influence on witnesses and other
participants, counsel, as suggested in some of the papers filed
here, well, it isn't going to be any surprise to anybody
participating in this trial that the proceedings going on here
are receiving and will receive public attention; so I don't
think that there is anything in the possibility -- in the
awareness that some people over in Oklahoma City might be
viewing this that's going to affect in any significant way the
conduct of the proceedings and the participants in it.

On the equal protection arguments that have been made,
I think there is a legitimate Governmental purpose in providing
for an opportunity for those who have compelling reasons to
have this very limited opportunity to see the trial
proceedings -- see and hear, I presume.

And I don't see here any burden on any fundamental
right in the case, particularly in view of the controls that I
intend to exercise.

And I don't see that there is a suspect class or any
invidious discriminatory purpose or any of those things that
are customary in looking at an equal protection analysis; so we
have a rational government purpose being served here.

Other issues that have been suggested here:  A
conflict with Rule 615.  Rule 615 will be applicable in the
receiving courtroom in the same fashion as in the trial
courtroom itself.  I don't intend for persons to view this who
are also going to be witnesses in the case; so it will apply
there as here.

The argument that it doesn't apply by its own terms
because the state line of Colorado is within 300 miles of
Oklahoma City -- I'm not persuaded by that argument.

And the argument also that Lawton is the place, not
Oklahoma City, because the trial was never scheduled for
Oklahoma City -- well, of course, the designation of Lawton was
made at one time by Judge Alley, who found that the place of
trial should be moved, found sua sponte, I guess, under Rule 18
that it should be moved because the selection of a jury in
Oklahoma City would be, I think he said, chancy.  So the -- the
place in which this trial would be conducted, all other things
being equal, would have been Oklahoma City; and I believe the
statute should be interpreted to mean just that; that the
transmission would be to Oklahoma City.

Now, there are a lot of problems, given what I've said
about the terms and conditions and subject to control.  These
problems may be insurmountable.  It has been suggested that
they are.  We have here the affidavit of this Dr. Welch from
southern California, University of Southern California, about
those problems.  Well, we will take a look at that; and I think
that's something we have to hold a hearing on.

It is suggested that it is not possible technically to
make it so that this signal cannot be intercepted.  I don't
know whether that's true or not true.  We'll have to find out;
and so we need a hearing really on who is going to view it, how
we're going to determine that, what monitoring must take place,
what controls must take place.  Certainly, there will be limits
on the numbers of people.  I'm aware, having been there, of
some of the courtrooms in Oklahoma City.  And of course, we'll
be using a courtroom, not an arena; and the seating facility --
the seating capacity there will be limited.  And who is in the
courtroom representing this court is something to be
considered, because I guess as it is an extension of the trial
proceeding, so it is an extension of my authority.

The fact that we start and if in the course of the
proceedings trouble arises, I'll know what to do.  The one
control that certainly is going to be required as a technical
control is an off switch within the reach of this arm, or this
arm, because I believe that the trial judge has to have the
capacity to stop the transmission at any time.  And what we
also need on the technology, the way I have understood it, is
some monitoring of how this signal is proceeding so that there
becomes some immediate awareness if there is a penetration and
a pirating, if those are the words, of the signal.  You may not
be able to prevent that from happening, but you can become
aware when it does happen and then exercise the authority to
stop it.

So the ruling is that the statute is not
unconstitutional on its face.  We'll have to work it out.

Now, that leaves us with the need to conduct that type
of a hearing at some convenient time.  We have other matters
that will have to be set as well in addition to what we already
have set on the severance and a motion to be filed; and we, of
course, have the whole matter of the laboratory and the
forensic evidence.  I don't know.

I know, Ms. Wilkinson, that you're the one who has
previously addressed that, and I presume have been following
it.

Have you any update on your report with respect to
that?

MS. WILKINSON:  I do, your Honor.

THE COURT:  Please tell us.

MS. WILKINSON:  I believe you asked the Government to
check with the Inspector General's office to determine if they

could tell us when they would have the report ready and if they
could not give us a date for the entire report, whether it
would be possible to extract certain portions which would be
relevant to this case.

THE COURT:  That was my request.

MS. WILKINSON:  We did that and heard from the
Inspector General's Office that they do not have a date certain
when they will complete the report.

Their best estimate -- they gave us two different
dates in November and December that they would complete the
report.  I believe that goes to the issue that the Court raised
the last time I spoke about this issue, and that is that they
have a much broader charter to investigate than this court is
considering in this case.

THE COURT:  Yes.

MS. WILKINSON:  That being said, I thought it might
help if I tell the Court briefly about some of the thing that
they're looking into that don't involve this case directly.
For example, they're investigating lots of other cases, as
Mr. Jones brought to your attention, United States vs. Moody,
which was the killing of the federal judge down in Georgia.
They're looking into that case and other specific cases.

But in addition to those other cases that don't
involve United States vs. McVeigh and Jones, they're also
looking at the general protocol, procedures -- I'm sorry -- did
I say Mr. Jones?

THE COURT:  Yes.

MS. WILKINSON:  Freudian slip.

MR. JONES:  I take it I'm no longer free to go.

THE COURT:  Do you want a lawyer?

MR. TIGAR:  Could we have judicial notice of what's
just been said here?

MS. WILKINSON:  I apologize, Mr. Jones.

The other thing is the Inspector General is looking
into are the procedures, the protocol and the management of the
laboratory in general and I believe -- although, again, we are
not privy to their final conclusions because they haven't made
any -- they're going to make recommendations in the report
about management of the FBI laboratory as a whole.

That being said, I believe the best way for us to
proceed is to schedule the hearings.  And I say that for two
reasons.  One is because we have provided the underlying data
that the Inspector General is using in his conclusions; that
is, the investigate -- the investigatory reports.  And we are
in the process of providing transcripts when they were taken or
when they were recorded, when the interviews were recorded, to
the defense, that apply in this case.

We also are working with the criminal division, which
is the portion of the department that has direct contact with
the Inspector General's office in terms of the Whitehurst

investigation; and we are also receiving any expert reports
written by the Inspector General's outside panel of experts in
connection with this case or in connection with conduct of
examiners as it relates to this case.

Based on that information and our continuing
obligation that we understand to provide that type of
information to the defendants, they will have access to the
same raw data that the Inspector General will in attacking our
experts.

That is important because we believe that is the
ammunition that the defense will need to challenge the
credibility of the experts and challenge the evidence itself
that we would like to introduce.

The report, the conclusions that the Inspector General
makes, would not, we believe, be admissible in this courtroom,
especially in the preliminary 703 hearings where the Court is
making a determination whether this -- each specific expert
that the defense challenges is admissible for the jury.  Again,
you're not going to make a determination as to the weight of
the evidence.  It's just as to whether this expert is truly
qualified to make the determination that we ask the Court to
introduce.

So for those reasons, we don't believe that the Court
should wait for the report nor that the defense needs that
report to fairly and thoroughly attack the Government's experts
or challenge their credibility or their expertise.

Another reason, your Honor, why we believe we don't
need to wait for the report is over the past year, we have been
providing the laboratory reports to the defense counsel.  They
know in large part who our experts are from the FBI laboratory,
to ensure that they know all of the experts that we're going to
introduce and all of the conclusions that we currently intend
to introduce.  And, of course, we would always inform the
parties and the Court that we reserve the right to introduce
additional expert testimony.  Depending on the challenge of the
defense and depending on the -- how our experts testify at
trial and how the evidence develops, we will provide the Rule
16 material to the defense which would outline each expert's
credentials and outline the general findings that we intend to
affirmatively introduce in court.  We will reference the
laboratory reports that they have so that they'll be able to
easily go back and check that they have the reports and they
have the underlying facts that the expert will testify to.

We told the Court several weeks ago that we would do
that by August 30.  We have reevaluated.  And if the Court is
willing to schedule the hearings at an earlier date, we are
willing to provide that material by -- August 2 is the earliest
date we think we could possibly do it for the defense.  And if
the defense needs several weeks to evaluate that to make the
challenges, they could do that during the month of August.

We believe again, your Honor, that they have had most
of this material for quite some time.  It's not as if we have
not turned over the lab reports throughout the case.  They know
what the major findings are that we intend to introduce.

However, for them to properly evaluate it, we would
recommend that they would have three weeks in August to review
those materials, the Rule 16 material.  Then they would give us
their challenges.  We are not sure at this point whether
they're going to challenge every single expert that the
Government intends to introduce.  As I mentioned before, there
is a fingerprint expert.  I can't imagine under Daubert that
they would challenge the reliability of fingerprint testimony
and I can't imagine that they would challenge the fingerprint
experts in this case based on the Whitehurst materials because
there are no challenges to the fingerprints section in the
laboratory.

And there may be reasons, your Honor, that the defense
does not want to, for tactical reasons, challenge other experts
in a preliminary hearing because they may believe they have
some --

THE COURT:  Yes.

MS. WILKINSON:  -- advantage.

We would ask that the Court then schedule the
hearings, giving us just two weeks once we receive the
defense's challenges; and we would present all the experts that

the defense challenges and try and establish their expertise
and credibility.

MR. JONES:  May I respond?

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. JONES:  Ms. Wilkinson's suggestion is unacceptable
for the defense, and it represents an attempt to rush to
judgment on the weakest part of their case, which is the
forensic evidence.

I want to go down each one of those points she's made.
The reason they want to rush to this hearing is because the
more we investigate, the more we find out, notwithstanding the
tremendous obstacles placed in our path, the more we know that
the FBI forensic laboratory as it relates to the important
point in this case is the emperor's new clothes.  First of all,
there isn't any reason to wait till August 2 to give us
anything.  We have asked for this material from the FBI
laboratory since November of last year, specific motions served
on them, which they have never responded to.

They give us lab reports in which the person that did
the work is not known to us until, finally, we insisted that we
be given some kind of explanation who this person or persons
is.  It contains absolutely no quantitative data, which is
absolutely essential to determine the credibility.  There is
nothing provided to us that relates to the contamination of the
laboratory.  We have no protocols.  We don't know how the

laboratory does this or that.  And we will shortly, thanks to
the Court's granting certain 848 -- we know a little bit more
about what they've been doing than we knew three weeks ago.

And we are preparing a detailed Rule 16 motion to the
Court to get it all, because our experts, who include some of
the world's most famous, well-recognized law enforcement
people, who are familiar with the laboratory, far more familiar
than I am, have told us how it operates and what we're entitled
to see in order to properly defend our client.

And they will sign affidavits and if necessary come to
this court and tell you why we need that material.  What they
want to give us is the tip of the iceberg.

For example, these transcripts, which they say they
can give us August 2, they have now.  They've had for months.
We have asked for them for months.

What we have received are small snippets which the
Court has under seal relating only to this case.  And they
said, Well, the Moody case doesn't relate to this case.  Of
course the Moody case relates to this case.  If nothing else,
it relates on the basis of contamination, because that is one
of the central criticisms that has been made under seal with
this investigation.  They don't want us to get a copy of the
report of the five experts or the Inspector General, because
the report is going to be devastating to their position.  They
want to single out that part of it and give it to us.

Now, the Court may say that's all we have to get; but
what we want to have the opportunity to do is to tell the Court
and in an adversarial proceeding, if necessary, why we are
entitled to more than what is being offered.  I represent to
the Court, having spent two weeks flying various places, that
what they're willing to give us isn't going to get the job done
and is a carefully controlled selection so that we can't get at
the heart of it; that this forensic heart does not inculpate
our client.

And that's just one of the discovery problems.  We are
still negotiating with the Government.  Two weeks ago we gave
them a 50-page letter -- I say two weeks ago, perhaps two and a
half weeks ago -- so that we don't burden the Court with that;
but this question of the FBI laboratory is critical to the
defense.  And in view of the extraordinary investigation, in
fact, unprecedented investigation going on in the lab in which
you have to bring in outside experts and the Inspector General,
it seems to me that that part is exculpatory.  We're entitled
to it.  It's the cornerstone of our defense, your Honor.

And most importantly, Ms. Wilkinson and some FBI
agents went not too long ago to interview General Bernard
Parton.  General Parton is a retired general of the United
States Army who has written a rather significant report
challenging the basic thesis of the Government's case.  He's
not our expert.  They went to interview him.  We haven't been

able to interview a single FBI agent in that lab despite
repeated written requests.

I think at the appropriate time we're going to ask the
Court -- and in fact, I invite the Court to issue the order
today -- that we be permitted to interview Frederic Whitehurst
forthwith, James Colby forthwith, and every one of those other
FBI agents that are involved in that investigation to find out
what they know about contamination of the lab as it relates to
this case and the works of Martz and Thurman.  There is no
reason why we can't interview those people, and they have
prohibited us from doing so; and yet they come before the Court
and say we're going to give them everything they need.

Well, fine.  We want to interview Special Agent
Whitehurst and these other nine agents.

THE COURT:  Mr. Tigar?

MR. TIGAR:  Your Honor, I don't understand the
Government's offer.  If the Government has a proffer of expert
testimony to make, it should make it.  When it has made it, we
will be in a position to tell the Court within a very few days
how much time we reasonably need to respond to it and to
prepare for a hearing.

Ms. Wilkinson's fundamental premise with which she
began is completely in error.  The report of the Inspector
General with respect to the Whitehurst matter under Federal
Rule of Evidence 803(8)(c) would be admissible if we offered it

but not if the Government offered it.  It is a report prepared
under lawful authority, factual findings resulting from an
investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law.

The Government can't introduce it, but we can in a
criminal case.  So I fail to see how that could be irrelevant
to us.

We may very well ask the Court when we see this to
wait until that report is available; but I can't tell you right
now.

Another example:  At the last hearing, Ms. Wilkinson
said that the Government had retained an entomologist, and I
thought the only bugs in the case were ones on people's
telephones.  But Mr. Nigh wrote and found out that the
entomologist is examining crank case drippings at the Geary
State Fishing Lake and their impact on insect colonies there,
and that will help them to date things.  I don't know how long
it will take us to find somebody who is equally enthusiastic
about insects or even if the Government intends to introduce
its entomologist.

I would suggest if the Government has its proffer that
it present it; that within a week from that time, we will tell
the Court how much time we reasonably need to get ready for a
hearing.

I will say to the Court that the American Bar
Association meeting is the first week in August.  I don't know

if the Court intends to be there.  I've been invited to give a
talk there, and I intend to do it.

THE COURT:  I don't intend to be there, for your talk
or any other.

MR. TIGAR:  I understand that, your Honor; and I
wanted to warn you just in case you were thinking of going
there.  But it's in Orlando; and my daughter voted that I go
there, and so therefore there will be two Mickey Mouse events,
my talk and then our visit.

And then if the Court please, unless the Department of
Defense decides to enforce the don't-ask/don't-tell policy, I
have a general court marshal for Major Deborah Meeks that
starts the 12th of August, a pro bono case; and I can't escape
that obligation.  But we can get to your Honor promptly some
report on when we'd be ready for a hearing, which will be with
all the speed we can muster.

But I think the first thing Ms. Wilkinson has to do is
to stop describing what they're going to do and then do it, and
then we'll see what our response should be.

THE COURT:  Well, actually, there are some other
things that I want to deal with with counsel on scheduling.
Now, I'm going to do that in chambers.  It's not, Mr. Kelley, a
part of the adjudicative process.  It is by way of doing some
things with respect to planning and scheduling that I think
legitimately are not public at this time.

<P>On May 17, 1995, the United States Senate, by a vote of 96-3, adopted

Senate Resolution 120, which established the Special Committee to Investigate

Whitewater Development Corporation and Related Matters (hereinafter the "Special

Committee"), to be administered by the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban

Affairs (the "Banking Committee").  Resolution 120 charged the Special Committee

with the responsibility to conduct an extensive investigation into and to hold

public hearings on specified matters relating to the President's and Mrs.

Clinton's investment in Whitewater Development Corporation ("Whitewater") along

with James and Susan McDougal, Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association

("Madison Guaranty"), and related matters.  

<P>In discharging its responsibilities under Resolution 120, the Special

Committee deposed 274 witnesses and held 60 days of public hearings, during

which 136 witnesses testified.  The Committee also reviewed approximately 1

million pages of documents produced by the President and Mrs. Clinton, the White

House, various federal agencies, and a number of individual witnesses.

<P>Resolution 120 authorized the Committee to investigate and to hold public

hearings into three general subject areas.  Section 1(b)(1) authorized

investigation into whether White House officials engaged in improper conduct in

handling papers in Deputy White House Counsel Vincent Foster's office following

his death on July 20, 1993--the so-called Foster Phase of the Special

Committee's inquiry.

<P> With respect to the Washington Phase of the inquiry, Section 1(b)(2)

authorized investigation into whether the White House improperly interfered with

any investigations or prosecutions by various federal agencies relating to,

among other things, Whitewater, Madison Guaranty related entities, and Capital

Management Services, Inc. ("CMS").

<P>Finally, in the Arkansas Phase, &#167; 1(b)(3) of Resolution 120 authorized the

Special Committee to investigate, among other things, the activities of

Whitewater, Madison Guaranty, CMS, Lasater & Co., and the work and billing

practices of the Rose Law Firm relating to Madison Guaranty.

1.<P>The Foster Phase.

<P>During the 103d Congress, the Banking Committee, pursuant to Senate

Resolution 229, conducted an inquiry into the cause of Mr. Foster's death and

the conduct of the subsequent investigation of his death by the United States

Park Police.  On July 15, 1994, Special Counsel Robert B. Fiske, Jr. advised the

Banking Committee that "public hearings on the subject of the handling of

documents in Mr. Foster's office while this investigation is continuing could

prejudice our investigation."1  Accordingly, the Banking Committee's public

hearings on July 29, 1994 into the cause of Mr. Foster's death excluded inquiry

into the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office.

<P>At the conclusion of the Banking Committee's hearings in the summer of

1994, the  following matters, among others, were identified for future inquiry

relating to Mr. Foster's death:

<P>*<P>the White House interference into the Park Police search of Mr.

Foster's office;



<P>*<P>the presence of White House counsel staff during standard Park Police

investigatory interviews;



<P>*<P>the White House insistence that the Park Police investigation proceed

with Department of Justice involvement to the extent that DOJ was "calling the

shots" and "setting up protocol" and the Park Police were "stand[ing] and

waiting for permission to do our job"; and



<P>*<P>the late delivery of the note in Mr. Foster's office to Park Police,

discovered by White House counsel.2

<P>On April 22, 1995, Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr advised the

Chairman and Ranking Member of the Banking Committee that his investigation

would not be hindered or impeded by a Senate inquiry into the way in which White

House officials handled documents in Mr. Foster's office following his death.

<P>Accordingly, the Special Committee commenced its investigation and public

hearings into whether White House officials engaged in improper conduct in

handling documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death.  The Special

Committee recognizes that Mr. Foster's death remains a source of much grief to

his family and friends.  In conducting its inquiry under section 1(b)(1) of

Resolution 120, the Committee sought to balance carefully the need to protect

the privacy of the Foster family and its duty to carry out fully the mandate of

the Senate.

2.<P>The Washington Phase.

<P>Resolution 120 directed the Special Committee to review the handling of

several federal investigations relating to the Whitewater real estate venture;

Madison Guaranty McDougal's S&L, the failure of which cost American taxpayers

more than $60 million; and CMS, a small business investment company owned by

David Hale, who made illegal loans to James and Susan McDougal in part to

finance the Whitewater investment.  Specifically, section 1(b)(2) of the

Resolution authorized the Special Committee to conduct an investigation and

public hearings into the following matters:

<P>(A)<P>whether any person has improperly handled confidential Resolution

Trust Corporation ("RTC") information relating to Madison Guaranty or

Whitewater, including whether any person has improperly communicated such

information to individuals referenced therein;



<P>(B)<P>whether the White House has engaged in improper contacts with any

other agency or department in the Government with regard to confidential RTC

information relating to Madison Guaranty or Whitewater;



<P>(C)<P>whether the Department of Justice has improperly handled RTC

criminal referrals relating to Madison Guaranty or Whitewater;



<P>(D)<P>whether RTC employees have been improperly importuned, prevented,

restrained, or deterred in conducting investigations or making enforcement

recommendations relating to Madison Guaranty or Whitewater; and



<P>(E)<P>whether the report issued by the Office of Government Ethics on

July 31, 1994, or related transcripts of deposition testimony --



<P><P>(i)  were improperly released to White House officials or others prior

to their testimony before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs

pursuant to Senate Resolution 229 (103d Congress); or



<P><P>(ii)  were used to communicate to White House officials or to others

confidential RTC information relating to Madison Guaranty or Whitewater.3

<P>In conducting the inquiry mandated during this so-called "Washington Phase"

of the investigation, the Special Committee examined whether the President and

Mrs. Clinton -- or their agents -- misused the power of the presidency in

responding to a series of investigations of the Whitewater matter.  As in the

past, the Senate sought to serve as the public's watchdog, to expose abuses of

the public trust. 

<P>Of necessity, the Special Committee inquired into the investigative and

prosecutorial processes of Executive Branch agencies to determine whether the

laws were properly and faithfully executed.  Congress has a duty to investigate

allegations that the normal investigative and prosecutorial processes of the

Executive Branch have been compromised.4  More important, Congress has the

constitutional obligation to ensure that the President's private interests have

not been elevated above the public good.



3.<P>The Arkansas Phase.

<P>This is the beginning of the Whitewater matter.  In this phase of its

inquiry, the Senate charged the Special Committee with investigating the complex

web of intermingled funds, fraudulent transactions, political favors, and

conflicted relationships which comprise the "20 years of public life in

Arkansas" that Mrs. Clinton did not want an independent counsel, among others,

to look into.5

<P>Specifically, Section 1(b)(3) of Resolution 120 authorized an investigation

and public hearings into the following matters:

<P><P>(A)  the operations, solvency, and regulation of Madison Guaranty

Savings & Loan Association, and any subsidiary, affiliate, or other entity owned

or controlled by Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association;



<P><P>(B)  the activities, investments, and tax liability of Whitewater

Development Corporation and, as related to Whitewater Development Corporation,

of its officers, directors, and shareholders;



<P><P>(C)  the policies and practices of the RTC and the Federal banking

agencies (as that term is defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance

Act) regarding the legal representation of such agencies with respect to Madison

Guaranty Savings and Loan Association;



<P><P>(D)  the handling by the RTC, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Savings and Loan

Insurance Corporation of civil or administrative actions against parties

regarding Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan Association.



<P><P>(E)  the sources of funding and the lending practices of Capital

Management Services, Inc., and its supervision and regulation by the Small

Business Administration, including any alleged diversion of funds to Whitewater

Development Corporation;



<P><P>(F)  the bond underwriting contracts between Arkansas Development

Finance Authority and Lasater & Company; and 



<P><P>(G)  the lending activities of Perry County Bank, Perryville,

Arkansas, in connection with the 1990 Arkansas gubernatorial election.

<P>These various subjects, seemingly disparate, are nevertheless woven

together by common and recurring themes of abuse of power, fraud on federal

institutions and theft of public funds, and frequent neglect, if not deliberate

disregard, of professional, ethical, and, at times, legal standards.

<P>*  *  *

<P>The Special Committee completed its task under Resolution 120 in a

bipartisan manner.  With few notable exceptions, the Special Committee conducted

its investigation and public hearings by mutual consent between the Chairman and

Ranking Member, thus obviating the need for votes by the Special Committee.

<P>Because the testimony of witnesses before the Special Committee was often

contradictory, incomplete, or inaccurate as to important events and actions, the

Committee placed particular emphasis on available documentary evidence. 

Unfortunately, throughout its inquiry, the Committee was hindered by parties

unduly delaying the production of, or withholding outright, documents critical

to its investigation.  Although the White House was most often and most notably

engaged in this course of action, the pattern of noncooperation extended to

other parties, as this Report lays out more fully in the Washington Phase of the

Special Committee's inquiry.

<P>This Report of the Special Committee is divided into three separate but

interrelated parts.  Part 1 focusses on the Foster Phase of the inquiry, into

whether White House officials engaged in improper conduct in the handling of

documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death.  Part 2 summarizes

the Special Committee's investigation into the Washington Phase and discusses

the handling of federal investigations into Whitewater and related matters, the

Administration's attempts to interfere with these investigations, and the White

House's attempts to interfere with Congressional inquiries into the

Administration's alleged improprieties.  Part 3 centers on the Arkansas Phase

and details the transactions and activities that comprise Governor Clinton's web

of political, personal, and business relationships--a web that includes, among

others, Whitewater, Madison, CMS, James McDougal, David Hale, and Danny Ray

Lasater.  Each Part begins with a separate, detailed outline and concludes with

respective endnotes.

<P>These three parts are interrelated because the entire story of Whitewater

is not simply the sum of its parts.  Rather, seeping through the pages that

follow are clearly identifiable patterns of motivation, conduct, and, at times,

concealment.  Beyond discrete judgments of impropriety in particular instances,

therefore, the Special Committee has examined the evidence and reached

conclusions that transcend any individual persons, actions, or events but rather

illuminate patterns of conduct behind the Whitewater affair.

<P>The Conclusions of the Special Committee are summarized at the beginning of

each Part.  They do not answer all questions and allegations that have surfaced,

but, taken together, they provide a comprehensive survey of the facts uncovered

by the Special Committee in its 13 months of investigation.  And they offer a

full, fair, and often troubling picture of the inner workings of government that

the Senate, by an overwhelming mandate, charged the Special Committee to present

to the American people.

        <H2>  CONCLUSIONS OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE</H2>



<P>     "Bernie, are you hiding something?"</P>



<P>               --Philip Heymann, former Deputy Attorney General.6</P>



<P>     Whitewater is a "can of worms you shouldn't open."</P>



<P>               --Vincent Foster's handwritten notes.7</P>



<P>     "HRC `doesn't want [an independent counsel] poking into 20 years of public life in Arkansas.'"</P>



<P>               --Diary of Roger Altman, former Deputy Secretary of Treasury, quoting Margaret Williams, Chief of Staff to the First Lady.8</P>



<P>     "Ms. Thomases and the First Lady may have been concerned about anyone having unfettered access to Mr. Foster's office."</P>



<P>               --Associate White House Counsel Stephen Neuwirth9</P>





<P>The death of White House Deputy Counsel Vincent W. Foster, Jr. on

July 20, 1993 marked the first time since the death of Secretary of Defense

James Forrestal in 1949 that a high-ranking U.S. official took his own

life.10  Now, almost three years later, the circumstances surrounding Mr.

Foster's tragic death remain the subject of much speculation and even

suspicion.  Against the backdrop of the death of a high-ranking U.S.

official, this controversy has been fueled by a series of misguided actions

taken by senior White House officials to shield the documents in Mr.

Foster's office from independent career law enforcement investigators and

to spirit the documents to the White House Residence.

<P>As Deputy Counsel to the President, Mr. Foster was the number two

lawyer in the White House.  He worked on the most important public issues

faced by the new Clinton Administration.  At the time of his death, Mr.

Foster also was one of the Clintons' key advisors on Whitewater and

Travelgate.  These matters are now the subject of criminal investigations

by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.  In fact, by July 20, 1993, federal

investigators already were examining Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan

Association, the S&L at the center of the Whitewater affair, as well as the

controversial firing in May 1993 of seven career White House Travel Office

employees.  Mr. Foster's office contained important evidence of actions

that the Clintons and senior White House officials took with respect to

Whitewater and Travelgate.

<P> The Special Committee's investigation into the handling of Mr.

Foster's documents was among the most important matters of inquiry under

Resolution 120.  It raised the question, once again in our nation's

history, whether the power of the White House was misused to serve the

purely private ends of the President and his associates:  specifically,

whether senior officials took improper steps, in their handling of Mr.

Foster's documents, to cover up embarrassing revelations or even crimes

relating to Whitewater and Travelgate.

<P>Often, the successful prosecution of financial crimes and public

corruption depends on the documentary trail left by the perpetrators of

such wrongdoing.  For example, Independent Counsel Starr recently obtained

the convictions of Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker and James and Susan

McDougal, the owners of Madison Guaranty and the Clintons' partners in the

Whitewater real estate development, in part on the basis of more than 600

documents introduced into evidence.  By the same token, the concealment or

removal of documents can seriously delay or derail investigation of

financial malfeasance.

<P>The White House undeniably mishandled the review of documents in Mr.

Foster's office following his death.  Department of Justice and Park Police

investigators told the Special Committee that their investigations were

hindered and impeded by the refusal of senior White House officials to

allow them to review Mr. Foster's documents.  The question before the

Committee, then, is whether senior White House officials simply committed

an inexplicable series of blunders and misjudgments or whether these

officials deliberately interfered with the investigations into Mr. Foster's

death and, perhaps, into the Whitewater and Travelgate affairs.<P>

<P>After careful review of all the evidence, the Special Committee

concludes that senior White House officials, particularly members of the

Office of the White House Counsel, engaged in a pattern of highly improper

conduct in their handling of the documents in Mr. Foster's office following

his death.  These senior White House officials deliberately prevented

career law enforcement officers from the Department of Justice and Park

Police from fully investigating the circumstances surrounding Mr. Foster's

death, including whether he took his own life because of troubling matters

involving the President and Mrs. Clinton.  At every turn, senior White

House officials prevented Justice Department and Park Police investigators

from examining the documents in Mr. Foster's office, particularly those

relating to the Whitewater and Travelgate affairs then under investigation.

<P>This pattern of concealment and obstruction continues even to the

present day.  The Special Committee concludes that senior White House

officials and other close Clinton associates were not candid in their

testimony before the Committee.  Specifically, the Committee concludes that

Margaret Williams, Chief of Staff to the First Lady, Susan Thomases, a New

York attorney and close advisor to Mrs. Clinton, Bernard Nussbaum,

then-White House Counsel, and Webster Hubbell, former Associate Attorney

General and now-convicted felon, all provided inaccurate and incomplete

testimony to the Committee in order to conceal Mrs. Clinton's pivotal role

in the decisions surrounding the handling of Mr. Foster's documents

following his death.

<P>Finally, the Special Committee concludes that the misconduct surrounding the handling of Mr. Foster's documents is part of a larger and more troubling pattern, that began in Arkansas in the 1980s and has continued in Washington during the Clinton Administration, in which the Clintons and their associates have sought to hinder, impede and control investigations into Madison Guaranty S&L and the Whitewater real estate investment.  Parts of this larger pattern include (i) Mrs. Clinton's decision in 1988 -- when federal investigators were examining possible misconduct leading to Madison Guaranty's failure just two years before -- to order the destruction of records relating to her representation of this S&L; (ii) Mr. Foster's and Mr. Hubbell's improper and unauthorized 1992 removal of Rose Law Firm records and files relating to Mrs. Clinton's representation of this corrupt S&L; and (iii) and the improper communication to White House officials during the fall of 1993 of confidential information relating to ongoing criminal investigations of Madison Guaranty and of Capital Management Services, Inc., a small business investment company also central to the Whitewater affair.

<P>*    *    *<BR>

1.<P>By the time of Vincent Foster's death in July 1993, the Clintons had established a pattern of concealing their involvement with Whitewater and the McDougals' Madison Guaranty S&L.

<P>The actions of senior White House officials and other close Clinton associates in the days and weeks following Mr. Foster's death cannot be viewed in a vacuum.  Their actions were but part of a pattern that began in 1988 of concealing, controlling and even destroying damaging information concerning the Whitewater real estate investment and the Clintons' ties to James and Susan McDougal and the Madison S&L.  Indeed, at the time of Mr. Foster's death, the Clintons and their associates were aware that the Clintons' involvement with Whitewater land deal, the McDougals, and the Madison S&L might subject them to civil liability and even criminal investigation. 

<P>In 1988, Mrs. Clinton ordered the destruction of records relating to her representation of Mr. McDougal's Madison S&L.11  This was not a routine destruction of records.  At the time, federal regulators were investigating the operation and solvency of Madison in anticipation of taking it over.  These Rose Law Firm records, which after Madison's failure would have belonged to the Resolution Trust Corporation ("RTC"),12 were directly relevant to that investigation.

<P>By ordering their destruction, Mrs. Clinton eliminated pertinent records and also exposed her firm to potential liability with respect to her representation.  Indeed, if such representation was proper, as Mrs. Clinton has claimed, her document destruction deprived the law firm of the records necessary to defend itself in a suit by federal investigators.  Moreover, in 1988, Seth Ward, a former associate of Mr. McDougal and Webster Hubbell's father-in-law, was actually suing Madison Guaranty over a land deal that federal regulators have described as a fraud.13  Mrs. Clinton had performed work on the project, including having numerous telephones calls and meetings with Mr. Ward, and the law firm record of her work and the transactions surrounding this land deal certainly would have been highly relevant to the conduct of that suit.

<P>Accordingly, Mrs. Clinton's destruction of documents could constitute a breach of legal ethics and, possibly, a violation of law if done with the knowledge that the documents are material to investigations or ongoing litigation.14  Professor Stephen Gillers of New York University, a noted ethics expert, has recently stated:  "I don't know how it could be that these files were destroyed. . . .  It makes it stranger that they were destroyed, not only so soon after they were created but also at a time when this lawsuit was about to go to trial. . . .  It certainly could lead to suspicion that she has something to hide because one possible inference from the destruction is that there was something in those files that she did not want to have made public."15   

<P>The pattern further continued during the 1992 presidential campaign, after questions arose about the Clintons' investment with the McDougals in Whitewater and Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison Guaranty before a state agency.  In an effort to respond to inquiries from the press and charges from other candidates, Mrs. Clinton's then-law partner, Vincent Foster, collected all the information he could on the Madison representation.  At the conclusion of the campaign, the Madison files, which were by now the property of the RTC as conservator of Madison, as well as the files of other Rose clients for whom Mrs. Clinton had performed legal services, were secretly removed from the firm by another then-Rose Law Firm partner, Webster Hubbell.  Mr. Hubbell removed these files, at times taking the firm's only copies,16 without obtaining the consent of the firm or client.17 Given that Mr. Hubbell was about to assume a position of great public trust as Associate Attorney General, his unauthorized decision to remove these files is especially troubling.

<P>Also during the 1992 presidential campaign, Mr. Foster or Mr. Hubbell ordered the printing of billing records relating to the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison Guaranty.  These important records revealed the extent of Mrs. Clinton's legal work for McDougal's S&L, including her telephone call to Beverly Bassett Schaffer, the Arkansas Securities Commissioner appointed by Governor Clinton, about the troubled thrift's controversial proposal to raise capital by issuing preferred stock.  The records also reflected Mrs. Clinton's work on the IDC or Castle Grande transaction, which federal regulators described as a series of fraudulent land flips.18  The records contain the handwritten questions of Mr. Foster to Mrs. Clinton and notations by Mr. Hubbell.19  Mrs. Clinton has recently stated through her lawyer that she may have reviewed them during the 1992 presidential campaign.

<P>After federal investigators began to look into matters relating to Madison Guaranty and Whitewater, a number of subpoenas were issued for these Rose Law Firm billing records.  By then, however, the records were nowhere to be found.  Despite extensive searches conducted by the law firm, neither the originals nor copies were discovered.20  They were not in the firm computers, its client files, or the firm's storage facility.21

<P>Apparently, at some point, someone removed these billing records from the Rose Law Firm.  In August 1995, Carolyn Huber, an assistant to Mrs. Clinton, discovered them in the book room of the White House Residence, next to Mrs. Clinton's office.22  At the time, Mrs. Huber did not realize the records were under subpoena, and she placed them in a box in her office.  In January 1996,23 Mrs. Huber identified these records, and personal counsel for the President and Mrs. Clinton turned them over investigators.  Mr. Hubbell testified that he last saw the records during the 1992 presidential campaign in the possession of Mr. Foster.24

<P>By July 1993, the Clintons and their associates had established a pattern of concealment with respect to the Clintons' involvement with Whitewater and the Madison S&L.  Because of the complexity of the allegations of misdeeds involving these institutions, documents and files are critical to any inquiries into the matter.  Yet, at every important turn, crucial files and documents "disappeared" or were withheld from scrutiny whenever questions were raised.

2.<P>The Clintons and their associates were aware, at the time of Mr. Foster's death, that the Clintons' involvement with Whitewater and the Madison Guaranty S&L might subject them to liability.

<P>In late fall 1992, Betsey Wright, the coordinator of "damage control" efforts during the presidential campaign and a former chief of staff to Governor Clinton, learned of a "criminal referral regarding a savings and loan official in Arkansas and . . . involv[ing] the Clintons."25  Ms. Wright testified that she learned this information from a Clinton supporter from California who had a friend who heard it at a cocktail party in Kansas City.26  At the cocktail party, an RTC official informed someone, whose friend reported it to Ms. Wright, that the RTC had just sent a "criminal referral up to the prosecutor in Little Rock."27  Upon hearing the news, Ms. Wright tried to gather more information about the referral.28  She then told Mrs. Clinton about the referral directly.  Ms. Wright testified:  "I remember I asked Hillary if she was aware of any friend of theirs who was in a savings and loan business who might be under criminal investigation, and we couldn't think of anybody."29 

<P>It is with this knowledge that the Clintons and their advisers came to Washington, taking with them the important documents relating to Whitewater and Madison.  The documents (including documents improperly taken from the law firm) were entrusted only to close associates of the Clintons, chiefly Messrs. Foster and Hubbell.

<P>By March 1993, senior Clinton Administration officials confirmed that the RTC had sent a criminal referral mentioning the Clintons to the Justice Department.30  Specifically, RTC Senior Vice President William H. Roelle testified that, after taking office, Roger Altman, then Deputy Treasury Secretary, directed the staff to inform him of all important or potentially high-visibility issues.31  According to Mr. Roelle, on or about March 23, 1993, he told Mr. Altman of an RTC referral involving the Clintons.32

<P>Powerful documentary evidence strongly indicates that Mr. Altman immediately passed this important information on to White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum.  On March 23, Mr. Altman sent Mr. Nussbaum a facsimile with a handwritten cover sheet, forwarding an "RTC Clip Sheet" of a March 9, 1992 New York Times article with the headline, "Clinton Defends Real-Estate Deal."33  This article reported the responses of presidential candidate, Bill Clinton, to an earlier Times report on the Clintons' Whitewater investment.  The next day, Mr. Altman faxed to Mr. Nussbaum the same article that he sent the day before and portions of the earlier Times report on Whitewater, dated March 8, 1992, entitled "Clintons Joined S&L Operator in an Ozark Real-Estate Venture."34

<P>In addition, SBA Associate Administrator Wayne Foren testified that, in early May 1993, he briefed Erskine Bowles, the new SBA Administrator about the agency's ongoing investigation of David Hale's Capital Management Services because the case involved President Clinton.35  Shortly thereafter, Mr. Bowles told Mr. Foren that he had briefed White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty about the case.36  Although Mr. Bowles did not recall being briefed by Mr. Foren about Capital Management37 or talking to Mr. McLarty about the case,38 Mr. Foren's account was corroborated by his deputy, Charles Shepperson.39  Mr. McLarty's calendar indicated that Mr. Bowles had two meetings with Mr. McLarty at the White House in early May 1993.40

<P>As of July 1993, therefore, Mrs. Clinton and others in the Administration were on notice that there was an ongoing federal investigation to which Madison-related documents could be relevant.

3.<P>At the time of his death, Mr. Foster's office contained damaging evidence about the Whitewater and Travelgate affairs.

<P>After he became Deputy White House Counsel, Mr. Foster continued to play a key role in controlling potential damage to the Clintons from Whitewater.  He was given the responsibility for overseeing the preparation of Clintons' tax returns for 1992 to reflect properly the sale of their shares in Whitewater.41  Mr. Foster worked with other White House officials in the Spring of 1993 in preparing a response to expected Whitewater questions.42  And, most interestingly, Mr. McDougal had left a message for Mr. Foster on June 16, 1993, "re tax returns of HRC, VWF and McDougal."43  The documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of death included a file on Whitewater and his notes of conversations with the Clintons' accountant, Yoly Redden, concerning the tax treatment of the sale of Whitewater.44  The notes identified the tax problem as a "can of worms you shouldn't open"45 and further warned: "Don't want to go back into that box  Was McD trying to circumvent bank loss -- why HRC getting loan from other."46

<P>Mr. Foster also played a central role in both the firing of seven career employees of the Travel Office on May 19, 1993 and subsequent attempts to conceal Mrs. Clinton's true role in the controversial firings.  Harry Thomason, a close Clinton confidant, reportedly instigated the firings after the career employees rejected his plan to obtain the White House's charter business for a company he partly owned.47  With public criticism growing, the White House circumvented normal procedures and directly asked the FBI (not the Department of Justice) to investigate allegations of possible criminal misconduct by the career employees of the Travel Office.48  Although Mr. Foster was not formally reprimanded for his role in the firings, he felt personally responsible.49

<P>Other senior White House officials implicated in Travelgate included David Watkins and Patsy Thomasson.  The Special Committee belatedly obtained a memorandum of Mr. Watkins outlining Mr. Foster's extensive involvement as Mrs. Clinton's conduit to the firings.50  Indeed, Mr. Watkins fingered Mr. Foster as the person who directly communicated to him Mrs. Clinton's order that the Travel Office staff be fired:  "Foster regularly informed me that the First Lady was concerned and desired action -- the action desired was the firing of the Travel Office staff."51  Notwithstanding Mrs. Clinton's clear involvement in the firing of the staff, Mr. Foster and other White House officials did not disclose her true role to investigators probing the affair.

<P>Significantly, at the time of his death, Mr. Foster's briefcase contained files, a personal notebook and a torn-up note, all concerning the controversial Travel Office matter.

<P>Thus, when Mr. Foster committed suicide in July 1993, White House officials were aware that a danger existed that the law enforcement officials might discover documents concerning Whitewater or Travelgate in his office.  In fact, David Margolis, one of the Justice Department officials who attended the search of Mr. Foster's office two days after his death, was aware of an RTC criminal referral concerning Madison that mentioned the Clintons.52  This risk of discovery provides the backdrop against which the story of Mr. Foster's death and the White House's subsequent scramble must be viewed.

4.<P>White House officials engaged in highly improper conduct in handling documents in Vincent Foster's office following his death.

<P>The evidence before the Special Committee established that White House officials engaged in a pattern of deliberate obstruction of, and interference with, efforts by law enforcement authorities to conduct their several investigations into Mr. Foster's death.

<P>This White House interference began immediately following Mr. Foster's death on the night of July 20.  Senior White House officials ignored specific requests by the Park Police to seal Mr. Foster's office on the night of his death.53  Instead, White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum, Chief of Staff to the First Lady Margaret Williams and Deputy Assistant to the President Patsy Thomasson entered Mr. Foster's office purportedly to search for a suicide note.

<P>According to career Secret Service Officer Henry O'Neill, and corroborated by Secret Service records, Ms. Williams removed file folders from Mr. Foster's office that night.  Even assuming, contrary to the testimony of Officer O'Neill, that no files were removed from the office that night, the multiple entries into Mr. Foster's office plainly compromised the integrity of evidence the Park Police considered to be valuable.54  Beyond this, Mr. Nussbaum not only ignored instructions to seal Mr. Foster's office, but also allowed Ms. Thomasson, a staffer without a security clearance who was involved in the Travel Office matter, to conduct an improper search of Mr. Foster's office. For reasons unknown -- but to a large extent illuminated by Officer O'Neill's testimony -- Margaret Williams also participated in the late night foray through Mr. Foster's office.

<P>The next morning, on July 21, Mr. Nussbaum's personal secretary, Betsy Pond, also rummaged through Mr. Foster's office -- ostensibly to straighten it up -- thereby disturbing important evidence.55  Stephen Neuwirth, Mr. Nussbaum's associate, immediately recognized the impropriety: "I didn't think it was appropriate for an assistant to Mr. Nussbaum to be in the office at that time."56  Thomas Castleton, a staff assistant, also entered Mr. Foster's office in the morning of July 21.57  Only the Park Police investigators were impeded in their attempt to enter Mr. Foster's office to search for evidence.  They waited in vain all day "for approval from Mr. Nussbaum" to conduct their investigation.58

<P>In addition, members of the White House Counsel's office participated in the Park Police interviews of White House staffers, not to protect the legal interests of the staffers but, in the words of Park Police Detective Peter Markland, to "report back to Mr. Nussbaum what was being said in the interviews."59  The White House Counsel's office coached the staffers about their testimony during a meeting on "comportment and interrogation."60  The Park Police left with the impression that their interviews had been rehearsed.61

<P>The pattern of obstruction continued with the White House dealings with the Justice Department.  Mr. Nussbaum agreed with Deputy Attorney General Heymann on the procedures for reviewing documents in Mr. Foster's office.62  The next day, when Susan Thomases, a close advisor to Mrs. Clinton and a member of the Whitewater defense team during the 1992 presidential campaign,63 complained about the review procedures after a conversation with Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Nussbaum broke the agreement and changed the procedures.64  In explaining this about-face, Mr. Nussbaum told his associate, Stephen Neuwirth, that Ms. Thomases and Mrs. Clinton were "concerned about anyone having unfettered access to Mr. Foster's office."65  Contrary to his promise to the Deputy Attorney General, Mr. Nussbaum proceeded to review the documents by himself and did not afford Mr. Heymann an opportunity to decide whether Justice Department officials should be present for the review.66

<P>The Special Committee concludes that Mr. Nussbaum engaged in highly improper conduct in braking the White House agreement with the Justice Department.  Mr. Nussbaum, in effect, interposed himself between the investigators and the matters under investigation.  Prompted by Mrs. Clinton, Susan Thomases, and senior White House officials, he made a conscious decision to interfere with a federal investigation.

<P>Beyond this, the Special Committee concludes that the "review" of documents in Mr. Foster's office on July 22 was a sham.  Law enforcement authorities did not review any documents; Mr. Nussbaum relied on their presence simply to "dress up" the review.67  Mr. Nussbaum ignored repeated complaints by Justice Department officials that they had no meaningful role in the review, and that Mr. Nussbaum was providing only a "generic description"68 of the files in the office.69  He carefully glossed over sensitive documents that he knew could embarrass the President and the Administration, including those relating to Whitewater and Travelgate.

<P>Almost immediately after law enforcement officers left Mr. Foster's office, Mr. Nussbaum went to work to conduct the real search in secret.  Michael Spafford, an attorney for the Foster family, testified that he overheard Mr. Nussbaum tell Mr. Sloan at the end of the meeting that they would look through the materials again later.70  Associate White House Counsel Clifford Sloan's notes of the meeting ended with the following: "get Maggie--go through office--get HRC, WJC stuff."71   

<P> Ms. Williams and Mr. Nussbaum collected the files, including at least one marked Whitewater.  Ms. Williams then consulted with Mrs. Clinton, and transferred one or two boxes of documents to the White House Residence for further review by the President and Mrs. Clinton.  In the case of Mr. Foster's highly sensitive Travelgate files, Mr. Nussbaum took the records to his office.72  There is also evidence that indices of files in Mr. Foster's office were altered or destroyed after his death.73  These indices were the only means of securing a chain of custody for Mr. Foster's documents.

<P>In short, senior White House officials deliberately disrupted the critical chain of custody of Mr. Foster's documents and may have lost or destroyed evidence now highly relevant to ongoing criminal investigations of Whitewater and Travelgate.

<P>During the July 22 search, Mr. Nussbaum also failed to inform law enforcement officials that scraps of paper were at the bottom of Mr. Foster's briefcase.  He was told by both Clifford Sloan74 and Deborah Gorham75 that papers remained in Mr. Foster's briefcase after his search, but did not inform law enforcement.  When Mr. Neuwirth finally "discovered" Mr. Foster's torn-up note on July 26, the White House waited a further 26 hours before notifying the authorities.  Although the ostensible reason for the delay was to permit the President and Mrs. Foster to review the note, White House officials conducted a series of meetings during this period to discuss the consequences of turning the note over to the authorities.

<P>Even without the benefit of all the facts uncovered by the Special Committee within the last year, Deputy Attorney General Philip Heymann aptly summed up the pattern of troubling behavior by the White House as it appeared to him on July 27, when he finally saw the note:

<P>    I'm trying to describe a collection of little things, each of which I'm prepared to believe is just a difference of opinion, and in my view, a clumsy and foolish way to handle the matter on the part of the White House staff and Mr. Nussbaum.



<P>    But they're starting to collect, and as they're collecting too much, and the last one's quite dramatic.



<P>    I mean, first of all, we had a sensible system for reviewing the documents, and that's changed to a system that doesn't have any law enforcement input into it at all.  It's changed without notifying me.



<P>    I'm vaguely worried about the Park Police feeling that they're not wholly able to investigate; those messages are not too clear.



<P>    And then along comes a note that should have been found on the 22nd, if they really went through all the documents.  I never looked at the briefcase but it at least worries me that perhaps it should have been found, and we learn about it 27 hours later.76

Mr. Heymann then ordered the Justice Department to investigate the discovery of the note and Mr. Foster's assertions made therein.

<P>Amazingly, the White House did not cooperate fully even with the new investigations ordered by Mr. Heymann.  During official FBI interviews, where they were under an obligation to tell the truth, senior White House officials did not tell the FBI that Mrs. Clinton saw the note, and that Susan Thomases was told about it by Mr. Nussbaum, before it was disclosed to the authorities.  At Mr. Heymann's request, the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility investigated Mr. Foster's assertion that the FBI lied in their report to the Attorney General on the Travelgate controversy.  Mr. Foster's notebook on that matter, which Mr. Nussbaum found in Mr. Foster's briefcase, was critical evidence to that investigation.  Nevertheless, instead of disclosing its existence to Justice Department officials, Mr. Nussbaum tucked away in his office Mr. Foster's notebook and other Travelgate materials.77

<P>In July 1995, when he found out about Mr. Nussbaum's concealment of Mr. Foster's Travelgate notebook, the Director of the Office of Professional Responsibility at the Justice Department, Michael Shaheen, wrote an angry memorandum to Associate Attorney General David Margolis.  After outlining specific instances of noncooperation by the White House, Mr. Shaheen concluded:  "The fact that we have just now learned of the existence of obviously relevant notes written by Mr. Foster on the subject of the FBI report is yet another example of the lack of cooperation and candor we received from the White House throughout our inquiry."78

<P>Viewed in the aggregate, then, these numerous instances of White House interference with several ongoing law enforcement investigations amounted to far more than just aggressive lawyering or political naivete.  Rather, the Special Committee concludes that the actions of these senior White House officials constitute a highly improper pattern of deliberate misconduct.

5.<P>Mrs. Clinton was closely involved in the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office following his death and directed that investigators be denied "unfettered access" to his office.

<P>From the moment that she was notified of Mr. Foster's death, Mrs. Clinton and her key agents -- Margaret Williams and Susan Thomases -- were engaged in the subsequent handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office.  Telephone records indicate that upon learning the news, Mrs. Clinton first called her Chief of Staff, Margaret Williams.79  After talking with Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Williams and her assistant, Evelyn Lieberman, drove to the White House and searched Mr. Foster's office.  The second call Mrs. Clinton made on the night of Mr. Foster's death was to the residence of Harry Thomason,80 a key player in the Travelgate scandal.  Mrs. Clinton then called Susan Thomases, who handled Whitewater damage control during the 1992 presidential campaign, and talked for 20 minutes.81

<P>This series of telephone calls in the hours immediately following Mr. Foster's death established a communications triangle among Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Thomases, and Ms. Williams that would surface frequently in the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office.  The evidence strongly suggests that Mrs. Clinton, upon learning of Mr. Foster's death, at least realized its connection to Mr. Thomason's Travelgate scandal, and perhaps to the Whitewater matter, and dispatched her trusted lieutenants to contain any potential embarrassment or political damage.

<P>After speaking with Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Thomases paged Ms. Williams, while Ms. Williams was searching Mr. Foster's office at the White House,82 presumably to monitor the progress of the search.  After the completion of her search, Ms. Williams returned home and called Mrs. Clinton at 12:56 a.m. on the morning of July 21.83  Upon the conclusion of her eleven minute conversation with Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Williams called Ms. Thomases at 1:10 a.m. and spoke for fourteen minutes.84

<P>These telephone calls illustrated a pattern that would be repeated at each critical event in the handling of papers in Mr. Foster's office: discussions among Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Thomases, and Ms. Williams; subsequent implementation by Ms. Williams, monitored by Ms. Thomases; and, finally, reporting by Ms. Williams to Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Thomases.

<P>The operation of the Clinton-Thomases-Williams triangle was best illustrated on July 22, when White House officials and Justice Department officials were scheduled to review documents in Mr. Foster's office.  Ms. Williams called Mrs. Clinton at 6:44 a.m. Central Daylight Time.85  Mrs. Clinton then called Ms. Thomases in Washington,86 who immediately paged Bernard Nussbaum at the White House.87  When Mr. Nussbaum called back, Ms. Thomases asked him about the upcoming review of Mr. Foster's office and, by Mr. Nussbaum's own account, said that "people are concerned" about the procedures to be employed for conducting the review.88

<P>Later that morning, Mr. Nussbaum told Mr. Neuwirth that the First Lady and Ms. Thomases were concerned about law enforcement officials having "unfettered access" to documents in Mr. Foster's office.89  

<P>At 10:00 a.m., when the document review was scheduled to begin, Mr. Nussbaum told Justice Department officials that he alone would review the documents, breaking a prior agreement with the law enforcement officials.  Throughout the day, while White House officials were meeting with Mr. Nussbaum to discuss procedures for reviewing documents in Mr. Foster's office, Ms. Thomases made repeated phone calls to the White House, in an apparent effort to monitor, and perhaps to affect, the progress of those discussions.  Telephone records indicated that, between 10:48 a.m. and 11:54 a.m., Ms. Thomases called the office of the Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty, three times and the office of the Chief of Staff to the First Lady, Margaret Williams, three times.90  At 12:55 p.m., Ms. Williams called the Rodham residence in Little Rock, apparently in response to a page from Mrs. Clinton's personal assistant.91  And records indicated that, at 1:25 p.m., approximately the time when Mr. Nussbaum told law enforcement officials that he alone would review documents in Mr. Foster's office, a telephone call was placed from the White House to the Rodham residence.92

<P>After Mr. Nussbaum finished his review of documents in Mr. Foster's office, he and Ms. Williams conducted a second review to segregate and remove the Clintons' personal files.93  Ms. Williams called Mrs. Clinton from Mr. Foster's office to seek instructions concerning where to place the files, and Carolyn Huber recalled that Ms. Williams said that "Mrs. Clinton had asked her to call me"94 about transferring the files to the residence.  Ms. Williams told Thomas Castleton that she was taking the files to the residence so that the Clintons could review them before they were handed over to Williams & Connolly.95  After the documents were transferred, Ms. Williams and Ms. Thomases again talked on the telephone at 5:13 p.m.96  At 7:12 p.m., Ms. Thomases called Mrs. Clinton in Little Rock.97  

<P>The evidence leads to the inescapable conclusion that, early in the morning of July 22, Mrs. Clinton, Susan Thomases and Margaret Williams discussed the procedures for conducting the review of documents in Mr. Foster's office.  Ms. Thomases then communicated their "concern[s]"98 to Mr. Nussbaum about his prior agreement with senior Justice Department officials.  In place of that agreement, which would have permitted those officials to review jointly Mr. Foster's documents with Mr. Nussbaum,99 the White House adopted a new procedure under which he alone would review the documents.  Thus, as Mrs. Clinton wished, law enforcement would not have "unfettered access" to Mr. Foster's documents.  Ms. Williams called Mrs. Clinton from Mr. Foster's office to ask where to take the Clintons' personal documents that she had segregated with Mr. Nussbaum.  After getting instructions from Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Williams transferred the files to the White House Residence for the Clintons to review.  After the new plan was fully executed, Ms. Thomases again talked to Ms. Williams and, according to telephone records, called Mrs. Clinton.

<P>On July 27, the day after a note in Mr. Foster's hand was discovered and the day that documents from Mr. Foster's office was transferred from the White House Residence to Williams and Connolly, Mrs. Clinton summoned Susan Thomases and Webster Hubbell to the White House.100  The three were in the White House Residence alone together, and Mr. Hubbell and Ms. Thomases left at the same time.101  Ms. Thomases and Mr. Hubbell studiously avoided testifying about this meeting in early appearances before the Special Committee.  However, when eventually confronted with clear documentary evidence, in the form of Secret Service logs,102 Ms. Thomases finally admitted that she recalled the three being together at the White House in the week following Mr. Foster's death.103  Ms. Thomases maintained that they did no more than exchange condolences with Mrs. Clinton,104  and that there was no discussion of the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office.  Mr. Hubbell stated that he went to the White House to give Mrs. Clinton an account of Mr. Foster's funeral after Mrs. Clinton left.105  He claimed that he did not see Ms. Thomases or discuss the Mr. Foster's note, which had been discovered but not disclosed to the authorities, with Mrs. Clinton.106

<P>The Special Committee concludes that this testimony of Ms. Thomases and Mr. Hubbell about their simultaneous visits to the second floor of the White House residence is highly implausible.  White House officials, investigators, and the media107 were all speculating about and searching for a note following Mr. Foster's death.  Yet both Ms. Thomases and Mr. Hubbell persist with their unbelievable story that the note was not discussed less than one day after it was discovered in Mr. Foster's briefcase. 

<P>In sum, the Special Committee concludes senior Administration officials and Ms. Thomases have sought to conceal the true involvement of Mrs. Clinton in the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office, an involvement that is unmistakably established by Mr. Neuwirth's admission, and by documentary records, all of which shatter the wall of denial erected by close Clinton associates.

6.<P>Senior White House officials and other Clinton associates provided incomplete and inaccurate testimony to the Special Committee.

<P>The Special Committee concludes that its effort to find the truth about the events of July 20-27, 1993 was impeded by what appeared to be a disturbing pattern of incomplete and inaccurate testimony by senior White House officials and close Clinton associates.  Time and again, the testimony of career law enforcement officials and others without a motive to lie, as well as documentary evidence, told one consistent story, while senior White House officials and close Clinton associates offered a contradictory version of the facts.

<P>Three Park Police officers testified that on the night of Mr. Foster's death, July 20, they told White House officials to take steps to seal his office -- requests the White House officials denied.  A Secret Service Officer testified that later that night he observed the First Lady's Chief of Staff, Margaret Williams, remove files from Mr. Foster's office;108 Ms. Williams denied that she removed anything from the office.

<P>This pattern continued on the next day, July 21.  Justice Department officials testified that they had reached an agreement with the White House concerning the procedures for searching Mr. Foster's office.109  Even though the contemporaneous documentary evidence supported the testimony of the Deputy Attorney General and career Justice Department officials,110 White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum and his associates denied the existence of any such agreement allowing law enforcement to examine the documents in Mr. Foster's office.111

<P>The Special Committee heard more of the same concerning the events of July 22.  Ignoring a peculiar pattern of early morning telephone calls involving the First Lady, Ms. Williams and Susan Thomases denied that Mrs. Clinton played any role whatsoever in the decision to bar law enforcement from looking at the documents in Mr. Foster's office.  Breaking ranks somewhat, Mr. Nussbaum admitted that he was told by Ms. Thomases that unspecified "people" were concerned about the upcoming search -- presumably, the First Lady, since Ms. Thomases was widely known for speaking with Mrs. Clinton's authority.  Finally, Stephen Neuwirth, a lower level counsel, admitted that Mr. Nussbaum told him that Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Thomases were concerned about giving law enforcement "unfettered access" to Mr. Foster's office.112

<P>This pattern continued later in the day on July 22, when Ms. Williams denied that she was bringing documents from Mr. Foster's office to the White House Residence for the Clintons to review.  Instead, she offered an implausible story to explain her decision to bring the documents to the Residence.113  Ms. Williams' account was contradicted by a young White House staffer, Thomas Castleton, who testified that Ms. Williams told him that "the President or the First Lady had to review the contents of the boxes to determine what was in them."114

<P>Beyond this, there is the curious discovery of Mr. Foster's note on July 26.  Thomas Spafford, a lawyer for the Foster family, testified that, on July 22, he overheard Clifford Sloan tell Mr. Nussbaum on July 22 that there were scraps at the bottom of the briefcase.  Messrs. Sloan and Nussbaum denied this.115 

<P>As set forth below in the Findings of this Report, the Committee concludes that four persons -- Margaret Williams, Susan Thomases, Bernard Nussbaum and Webster Hubbell--provided incomplete and inaccurate testimony to the Committee in an apparent effort to conceal the intimate involvement of Mrs. Clinton in the events following Mr. Foster's death.

7.<P>The Office of the White House Counsel was misused to impede ongoing investigations and to serve the purely personal legal interests of the President, Mrs. Clinton and their associates.

<P>Every citizen is entitled to mount a defense to civil and criminal charges.  The President is no different.  He is not entitled, however, to use the power of his office to gain a defense of his private legal affairs not available to other Americans.  The White House Counsel's Office is supposed to serve the President in his official executive capacity.  These lawyers are paid by the taxpayers to serve the public interest.

<P>In the matter of Mr. Foster's death, the Office of the White House Counsel served, in effect, as the Clintons' personal defense law firm.  This service extended beyond Mr. Foster's employment as the Clinton's personal attorney to the use of the White House Counsel's Office in the days following his death to interfere with and hinder several ongoing federal investigations into Mr. Foster's death and the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death.  Instead of cooperating with law enforcement officials, the Office of the White House Counsel impeded the investigations of the Park Police and the Department of Justice.  The White House lawyers ignored and, in some cases, intentionally violated established procedures that would have ensured the proper handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office.

<P>The impropriety of these and other actions -- actions that prompted the Deputy Attorney General to ask Mr. Nussbaum, "Bernie, are you hiding something?" -- is compounded when one recognizes that these actions were taken by members of the Office of the White House Counsel.  These were government lawyers who were supposed to protect the public interest in proper investigations and faithful execution of the laws, not to do the private bidding of the President and First Lady.

<P>The Special Committee concludes that the White House Counsel's Office was misused in the aftermath of Mr. Foster's death to interfere with and to obstruct various federal investigations.  This pattern of abuse by the White House Counsel's Office is not limited in time or scope, but rather has recurred throughout the Special Committee's investigation into other matters authorized by Senate Resolution 120.  These include efforts to obtain improperly confidential law enforcement information from the RTC and from the Small Business Administration, all while coordinating with private attorneys representing the Clintons as subjects of investigation.

<P>The Special Committee recommends that steps be taken to insure that such misuse of the White House Counsel's Office does not recur in this, or any future, Administration.

<P>*<P>*    *

<P>Taken as a whole, the events described in this Report and summarized in this conclusion, reveal a concerted effort by senior White House officials to block career law enforcement investigators from conducting a thorough investigation of a unique and disturbing event -- the first suicide of a very senior U.S. official in almost fifty years.  Unquestionably, the Department of Justice and Park Police were authorized to conduct this investigation, and White House officials owed them a duty to cooperate.  Instead, law enforcement officials were confronted at every turn with concerted efforts to deny them access to evidence in Mr. Foster's office.  Strikingly, the Counsel to the President carried out the wishes of the First Lady by breaking his earlier agreement with the Deputy Attorney General of the United States.  And law enforcement officials were forced to sit still as White House lawyers conducted a charade of a search.  Only after the duly appointed investigators had departed, did the White House Counsel and the First Lady's Chief of Staff begin the real search, which resulted in the transfer of documents to the White House Residence; the removal of Mr. Foster's Travel Office notebook; and the disappearance of important document indices that would have reflected the full contents of his files.

<P>The actions of the White House are especially serious because the Special Committee has discovered that the files shielded from the Department of Justice contained evidence relevant to two investigations that touched on the Clintons' personal interests: the criminal referral into Madison S&L, and the anticipated investigation, by Congress and others, into the Travel Office firings.  As demonstrated in this Report, the White House, including Mrs. Clinton, were on notice that these investigations were either ongoing or imminent.  As it happens, both of these investigations were of sufficient weight to be now under the jurisdiction of an Independent Counsel.

<P>Against this background, the actions of the White House during the week after Mr. Foster's death must be judged.  These White House actions were highly improper; they were deliberate; and they adversely affected ongoing investigations by career law enforcement officials.  The American people will never be sure of the contents of Vincent Foster's office at the time of his death.  Their uncertainty and doubts, however, clearly are the direct result of the wrongful action by the White House.

  <H2>       BACKGROUND</H2>

  

<P>The death of any senior U.S. official is sure to be a matter of public concern.  But Mr. Foster's death swelled into a substantial controversy because of two additional factors.  First, Mr. Foster had a very close and long-standing personal and professional relationship with the President and Mrs. Clinton.  As a prominent lawyer in Arkansas and then as Deputy White House Counsel, he provided legal counsel to them on a number of sensitive personal matters.  Questions therefore arose as to whether concerns about any of these matters, including the Whitewater and Travelgate affairs, contributed to Mr. Foster's death.  Second, senior White House officials, particularly members of the Office of the White House Counsel, took actions in the days following Mr. Foster's death to search and to review the contents of Mr. Foster's office while preventing law enforcement officials from doing the same.  These actions raised serious questions about whether, in the wake of Mr. Foster's death, the Office of the White House Counsel was misused to serve the purely personal legal and political interests of the President, the First Lady and their associates.

<P>I.  Mr. Foster's Involvement in the Clintons' Personal Matters

<P>Vincent Foster was born on January 15, 1945 in Hope, Arkansas.  He attended kindergarten with future President William Jefferson Clinton and future White House Chief of Staff Thomas "Mack" McLarty.  Mr. Foster graduated from Hope High School in 1963 and from Davidson College in 1967.  Mr. Foster graduated first in his class from the University of Arkansas School of Law in 1971, and passed the bar exam later that year with the highest score in the state.  He then joined the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas, and became a full partner two years later, in 1973.  Mr. Foster's partners included future First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, future Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell, and future Associate White House Counsel William Kennedy.

<P>Messrs. Foster and Hubbell participated in efforts during the 1992 presidential campaign to control damage arising from the Whitewater matter and, specifically, to Mrs. Clinton's representation of the Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association.  James and Susan McDougal, the Clinton's partners in the real estate venture at the heart of the Whitewater affair, owned and controlled Madison.  On May 28, 1996, James McDougal was convicted of eighteen federal felonies and Susan McDougal was convicted of four federal felonies.  These convictions related both to the operations of Madison and the Whitewater real estate investment.  During the 1992 campaign, Mr. Hubbell improperly removed from the Rose Law Firm its files concerning its representation of Madison.  Messrs. Hubbell and Foster also reviewed Rose Law Firm billing records relating to Rose's representation of Madison.116  These records were found in the White House Residence in August 1995 and finally turned over to investigators in January 1996, more than two years after they were first subpoenaed.  The records contain handwritten questions from Mr. Foster to Mrs. Clinton; it is not possible to date when these questions were put to Mrs. Clinton.

<P>In January 1993, President-elect Clinton asked Mr. Foster to become White House Deputy Counsel.  Mr. Foster's office on the second floor of the West Wing of the White House was in the same suite as that of White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum.  The Counsel's suite was located right next to the West Wing office suite of the First Lady.  

<P>As Deputy Counsel, Mr. Foster worked on many sensitive legal and political matters for the Clintons.  In May 1993, Mr. Foster assigned his former law partner, Associate White House Counsel William Kennedy, to investigate allegations of mismanagement and misappropriation of funds in the White House Travel Office.  On May 19, 1993, the White House fired seven career employees of the Travel Office.  Almost immediately, the White House came under intense criticism for its handling of these firings.  According to press reports, less than a month after President Clinton's inauguration, Catherine Cornelius, the President's cousin, wrote a memorandum proposing that the White House dismiss the career employees of the Travel Office and that she run the operation.117  The memorandum cast doubts on the administration's claim that the seven career employees were fired for financial misconduct.  In addition, Harry Thomason, a close friend of the Clintons, reportedly had attempted to steer the White House's lucrative charter business to an aviation company that he partly owned.118  Rebuffed by the career employees of the Travel Office, Mr. Thomason reportedly accused them of wrongdoing.119

<P>As public criticism mounted, the White House asked a senior FBI official, John Collingwood, to attend a "political strategy session" with senior presidential advisers on how to deal with the growing scandal.120  On the same day, the White House took the highly unusual step of releasing a confidential FBI statement confirming that the bureau was investigating possible criminal misconduct in the Travel Office.121

<P>Thus, in addition to allegations of cronyism underlying the firing of the career employees, the White House came under fire for misusing the FBI, an independent investigative agency, for its own political ends, a charge that would surface time and again as the White House attempted to contain and manage embarrassing and potentially incriminating information through contacts with federal investigative agencies.  Protocols required that White House contacts with the FBI go through the Department of Justice, and "[b]y calling on the FBI to help save the Administration from embarrassment, the White House appeared to be deviating from two decades of efforts to insulate the law-enforcement agency from even the appearance of Presidential manipulation."122  The FBI conducted an internal inquiry into contacts between its agents and the White House, and the White House initiated its own investigation into the matter.  On July 2, 1993, the White House released the report of its internal review, which sharply reprimanded Mr. Kennedy and others.  Although Mr. Foster was not formally reprimanded, he felt personally responsible for the affair and insisted that Mr. Nussbaum allow him to shoulder the blame.123  Mr. Foster's secretive files on the Travel Office controversy were in his briefcase at the time of Mr. Foster's death, together with a torn-up note purportedly discovered six days later.  The note listed Mr. Foster's troubles and concerns, many of which dealt with the Travel Office controversy.

<P>The Travel Office affair apparently weighed heavily on Mr. Foster's mind at the time of his death.124  Many colleagues, confidantes, and friends of Mr. Foster stated to investigators that "the single greatest source of his distress was the criticism he and others within the Counsel's office received following the firing of seven employees from the White House Travel Office."125  However, according to a FBI report of an interview with Susan Thomases, who "got to know Vince Foster fairly well" from her work with the Clinton campaign, transition, and administration,126 "[h]is death came as a complete shock to her and she can offer no reason or speculation as to why he may have taken his life."127  According to the FBI report, Ms. Thomases last saw Mr. Foster on "Wednesday or Thursday before his death," when "they had lunch together with some people in Washington."128

<P>Ms. Thomases has made subsequent statements that contradict the FBI report of her interview.  In Blood Sport, an account of the Whitewater affair, author James Stewart reported that Ms. Thomases last saw Mr. Foster on the Wednesday evening before his death.129  Their last meeting was not a public luncheon, as the FBI report recorded, but was at the Mansion on O Street, a private hotel frequented by Ms. Thomases.  Ms. Thomases had suggested the location after Mr. Foster asked to speak to her "off the campus."130  According to Blood Sport, Mr. Foster confided in Ms. Thomases during that last meeting, telling her about his personal and professional troubles.  Mr. Foster reportedly did not want to "let the president and Hillary down" and, in particular, referred to the Travel Office affair.  Mr. Foster reportedly stated to Ms. Thomases that "he didn't trust David Watkins, who he feared might fabricate or embellish the facts to cover himself--possibly at the expense of the first lady."131

<P>When asked about the apparent discrepancy between her FBI statement and her interview with Mr. Stewart, Ms. Thomases told the Committee that she told the FBI agent about her last meeting with Mr. Foster at the Mansion on O Street.132  She offered no explanation as to why the agent failed to record this significant fact.  Ms. Thomases admitted that she spoke to Mr. Stewart in connection with Blood Sport, but claimed, "I don't believe that I said that that's what happened with [Mr. Foster] that night.  I think [Mr. Stewart] probably put together different pieces of a different conversation."133  Ms. Thomases maintains that her statement to the FBI that "she can offer no reason or speculation as to why he may have taken his life,"134 was correct, because "I still do not feel that I'm ready to speculate on why he took his life."135

<P>During his brief tenure as Deputy White House Counsel, Mr. Foster handled a number of sensitive personal matters for the President and the First Lady--continuing, even though he was now on the public payroll, his Arkansas role as personal lawyer to the Clintons.136  For example, among the files in Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death were the following: 

<P>1.     Whitewater Development137<BR>

     2.     Clinton Exploratory Committee138<BR>

<P>Perhaps the most sensitive matter that Mr. Foster handled for the Clintons concerned their investment in Whitewater.  In 1978, the Clintons and James and Susan McDougal jointly purchased 233 acres in the Arkansas Ozarks.  Neither the Clintons nor the McDougals contributed any equity into the purchase.  Instead, Jim McDougal and Bill Clinton, then Attorney General and the Governor-elect of Arkansas, borrowed $20,000 from Union National Bank.  Mr. McDougal's loan officer at Union National Bank, Harry Denton, would later become the chief lending officer at Mr. McDougal's Madison Guaranty S&L.  The rest of the purchase money was financed by a mortgage of $182,611.20 from Citizens Bank of Flippin, a loan in which Union National Bank took a 50 percent participation.

<P>In June 1979, the Clintons and McDougals formed Whitewater Development Company, Inc. ("Whitewater") and eventually transferred ownership of the land to the new corporation.  The Clintons and McDougals intended to subdivide the property into lots for sale as vacation property.  Slow sales at lower than anticipated prices, however, resulted in a cumulative loss of $193,189 for Whitewater by the end of 1986.  Although the McDougals and the Clintons purportedly were equal partners in the project, their contributions to the company to cover its losses were greatly disproportionate.  Of the $194,493 that the shareholders contributed to Whitewater, the McDougals and their companies contributed $158,523, while the Clintons advanced only $35,970.

<P>When Bill Clinton ran for President in 1992, the Whitewater investment and his relationship with James McDougal became a source of political embarrassment.  Over the years, the Clintons took a series of questionable deductions on their federal income tax returns related to their investment in Whitewater.(157)  And, in March 1989, federal regulators closed Madison Guaranty S&L.  Madison's insolvency ultimately cost federal taxpayers over $60 million.(158) 

<P>On March 8, 1992, the front page of the New York Times carried this headline: "Clintons Joined S&L Operator In An Ozark Real-Estate Venture."  The article, written by Jeff Gerth, reported the ties between the Clintons and the McDougals, focusing attention on their investment in Whitewater and the questionable tax deductions taken by the Clintons in 1984 and 1985.  The Times report suggested that Whitewater may have been used as a conduit to funnel money to the Clintons or to Bill Clinton's political campaigns.

<P>Ms. Thomases played a key role in responding to the Times inquiries about Whitewater.  She and Loretta Lynch, another attorney working for the Clinton campaign, gathered information relating to Whitewater and, specifically, to Mrs. Clinton's representation of McDougal's Madison Guaranty before state regulators.

<P>Mr. Hubbell and Mr. Foster compiled information from the Rose Law Firm to help the response effort.  According to Mr. Hubbell, "the issue then, way back when, was did Mrs. Clinton ever have any contact with the Arkansas Securities Department.  When we went back to the bills, that was the only, I believe, indication on the bills of a direct contact with the Arkansas Securities Department, so I underlined that -- probably gave that to Vince."(159)

<P>Indeed, in notes taken during the 1992 campaign, Susan Thomases recorded a February 24, 1993 conversation with Webster Hubbell about the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison.  According to the notes, Mr. Hubbell told Ms. Thomases that Mrs. Clinton did all the billing for the Rose Law Firm to Madison, and that she had numerous conferences with Jim McDougal, Madison President John Latham, and Rick Massey, then a junior associate at the firm.(160)  The notes also indicated that Mrs. Clinton had reviewed some documents and that she had one telephone conversation with Beverly Bassett Schaffer in April 1985.(161)  Ms. Thomases recorded in the margin of her notes at this point: "Acc. to time Rec."  She testified that "[t]his is my notation for according to time records,"(162) which is what Mr. Hubbell had indicated to her.(163)  Ms. Lynch confirmed that Mr. Hubbell reviewed timesheets and billing records relating to the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison.(164)

<P>The billing records mysteriously disappeared after the 1992 campaign.  Despite four subpoenas from separate federal investigations for over two years, the billing records were not disclosed until they were "discovered" in the third floor of the White House Residence, next to Mrs. Clinton's office in the private quarters.  

<P>Eventually, the Clinton campaign released a report on the Whitewater investment authored by James Lyons, a Colorado attorney retained by the campaign.  The Lyon's report stated that, rather than gaining an illicit profit from their association with Mr. McDougal, the Clintons actually lost $68,900 on their investment in Whitewater.  Mr. Lyons apparently prepared two versions of his report.  In a confidential letter to the Clintons on April 10, 1992, he enclosed a "complete report" on Whitewater by Patten, McCarthy & Associates, an accounting firm he had retained to study Whitewater.  Mr. Lyons wrote:

<P>Please note the enclosed complete report discusses such things as the $9,000 interest deduction taken by you in 1980 (paragraph 4, page 5), lot 13 and -borrowings associated with it (paragraph 5, page 5), and the sale of 24 lots in 1985 to Ozark Air for assumption of the mortgage and an airplane (paragraph 6, page 6).  None of these items is set out in the summary report which was released to the press.(165)

Mr. Lyons advised the Clintons that there are only three copies of the complete report, and wrote that "it is my recommendation to you that you maintain the complete report in strictest confidence and do not waive either the attorney/client or accountant/client privilege which attaches to the enclosed report."(166)  Mr. Foster assisted Mr. Lyons in preparing the report.(167)

<P>The Lyons report temporarily quelled the media interest in the Whitewater story, but Clinton advisors remained worried over legal and political implications of this investment.  Among the documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death was his handwritten note: "Get out of White Water."(168)  To that end, Mr. Foster, Mr. Hubbell and others in the Clinton organization met with Mr. Lyons on November 24, 1992, two weeks after Mr. Clinton was elected President.(169)

<P>The point man for the Clinton team in this effort was James Blair, General Counsel of Tyson Foods and a longtime friend and advisor to the Clintons.  Mr. Blair had also known Mr. McDougal for over 30 years and had contacted Mr. McDougal in early 1992 when questions arose about Whitewater.(170)  Mr. Blair called Mr. McDougal's attorney, Sam Heuer, and told him that "the Clintons and the McDougals needed to be totally separated over the Whitewater thing."(171)  According to Mr. Blair, he suggested that Mr. McDougal pay a nominal amount to buy the Clintons' interest in Whitewater.(172)  "I think we settled on a thousand dollars as an appropriate nominal amount."(173)  There was one problem: "McDougal doesn't have a thousand dollars."(174)  Mr. Blair then told Mr. Heuer, "[W]ell, what the heck, I will loan him the thousand dollars.  I'll just Fed Ex you a check to your trust account.  And I believe that's what I did."(175)  Mr. McDougal has never repaid Mr. Blair.(176)

<P>On December 22, 1993, Mr. McDougal and the Clintons executed the transaction to get the Clintons out of Whitewater.  Mr. Blair then assigned Mr. Foster the task of contacting the accountants and preparing the Clintons' tax returns.(177)  The issue facing Mr. Foster in the months preceding his death was how to treat the $1000 sale on the Clintons' 1992 tax returns.  The basic dilemma stemmed from the Clintons' claim, bolstered by the publicly released Lyons report, that they had incurred significant losses on their investment in Whitewater.  The problem with declaring the loss on the Clintons' tax return was the lack of a proper basis with which to calculate the cost of the venture to the Clintons.  Despite their claim that they were 50% partners in the venture, the Clintons had contributed less than 25% of the funds used to cover Whitewater's losses.

<P>Among the documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of death were his notes of conversations with the Clintons' accountant, Yoly Redden.(178)  The notes, in Mr. Foster's hand, identified the tax problem as a "can of worms you shouldn't open."(179)  His notes in the file outlined the basic tax issues the Clintons faced in connection with Whitewater:

<P>"1)<P>What was nature of deductions

<P><P>A.  How deduct interest/principal payments for corp.?



<P>2)<P>Can you use contribution which predated incorporation?



<P>3)<P>Contribution/advancements of $68,900 to the McD



<P>4)<P>Inability to utilize $8000 capital loss"(180)

Mr. Foster's objective was to avoid calling attention to Whitewater during the annual audit of the President and Mrs. Clinton's tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service audit.(181)  One approach was simply to report a wash, that is, to show no loss and no gain from the venture, thereby obviating the need for any tax treatment.  The problem with such treatment, however, was that it would have bolstered the allegation that the Clintons were insulated from Whitewater losses and thus the company was a vehicle for Mr. McDougal to channel funds to the Clintons.  In notes titled "Discussion Points," Mr. Foster wrote:

<P>1)<P>An argument that they were protected against loss:

<P><P>A)  wash is consistent with this theory(182)



But Mr. Foster did not a have a proper cost basis with which to calculate the Clintons' true losses or gains.  His discussion points continued:

<P>2)<P>Improper to reduce basis by improper tax benefit



<P>3)<P>Computation of economic loss was based, in part, on assumptions

<P><P>Whereas computation of tax gain or loss must be defensible in audit.(183)

<P>Therein lay the problem.  To claim a loss based on economic assumptions, as the Lyons' report did, was one thing.1   But to claim a loss on the Clintons' 1992 tax returns without proper support and documentation increased the likelihood of calling attention to Whitewater during the IRS audit--of opening the can of worms that Mr. Foster and the Clintons' accountant wished to keep sealed.(184)  Mr. Foster's notes summarized the options as follows:

<P>"10<P>Options

<P><P>$1000 basis<P>so no tax effect

<P><P>but is arbitrary & still risks audit

<P><P><P><P>    vs

<P><P>0 basis w/ $1000 gain

<P><P>avoids any audit of issue"(185)

In a letter to Mr. Foster days before the tax returns were due, Ms. Redden, the accountant the Clintons hired to handle Whitewater tax issues, wrote:  "Because of the numerous problems with Whitewater records and the commingling of funds with other companies and individuals, I believe many explanations may have to be made if we claim a loss."(186) This letter, addressed to Mr. Foster, was not among the documents in Mr. Foster's office that the White House produced to the Special Committee.  It was obtained by the Special Committee through another source.(187)  Ms. Redden testified that after the Clintons were in the White House she had a number of discussions with Mr. Foster concerning tax issues related to Whitewater.(188)  The main focus of these numerous communications was the tax basis for the Clintons' contributions to Whitewater and how to treat the $1000 payment.(189)

<P>The Clintons' final tax returns for 1992 reported a capital gain of $1000 from the sale of stock to Mr. McDougal.(190)  According to Ms. Redden, "I think we need to claim no gain or a loss."(191)  Mr. Foster did not follow her advice, however, because he was also consulting with another accountant, and "[a]t the end we compromised what we were going to put in the return in connection with Whitewater."(192)

<P>For reasons unknown, on June 16, 1993, Mr. McDougal called Mr. Foster at the White House.  Unable to reach Mr. Foster, he left a message with his secretary: "re tax returns of HRC, VWF and McDougal."(193)  It is unclear whether Mr. Foster returned Mr. McDougal's telephone call, and it is unclear why Mr. McDougal contacted Mr. Foster about Mr. Foster's tax returns.

<P>Mr. Foster also worked with Ricki Seidman, then Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Director of Communications, on the Whitewater  matter in the first half of 1993.  In June 1994, Ms. Seidman told the FBI the following about her relationship with Mr. Foster and her involvement in Whitewater:

<P>Seidman was asked about FOSTER's involvement with Whitewater.  She said the only Whitewater issue she could recall was in April, 1993 in connection with the CLINTONs tax returns.  The tax returns show that the CLINTONs had divested themselves of their interest in Whitewater.  SEIDMAN's involvement was from a "communications perspective".  The Whitewater issue had surfaced during the campaign, interest had then ended, and it was believed the tax returns would bring the Whitewater issue into the "public domain again".  SEIDMAN said there was discussion regarding the "soundest way" to seek closure to the issue.  The options considered were (1) declare a loss; (2) declare an even split; and (3) declare the Clintons received a $1000 gain.  SEIDMAN said she and FOSTER were discussing these options.  She remembered attending meetings at WILLIAMS and CONNOLY [sic] on the issue.(194)

<P>The Clintons' Whitewater investment created other problems that occupied Mr. Foster's time as Deputy White House Counsel.  Among the documents found in Mr. Foster's office following his death were campaign disclosure forms, required by law, accounting the personal finances of the Clintons and of their campaign organization.(195)  On January 10, 1992, the Clinton for President campaign filed a disclosure form that failed to disclose that the Clintons had personally guaranteed a loan to the Whitewater Development Corporation.(196)  Yoly Redden, the Clintons' accountant, testified that she assisted the campaign in preparing the disclosure statements.(197)  According to Ms. Redden, there were discussions about the Clintons' Whitewater investment, and a decision was made to omit it from the statements.  "We were told, it was our understanding that the Whitewater investment was worthless, they were not going to get anything out of it at that point in time."(198)

<P>On April 6, 1992, after the New York Times article detailing the Clintons' Whitewater investment, the campaign revised the statement to disclose the Clintons' personal liability for the Whitewater loan.(199)  The revision, however, did not deal with the more troublesome issue concerning disclosure:  how to treat the McDougals' disproportionate share of Whitewater losses?  By assuming more than 50 percent of Whitewater losses, the McDougals had in effect given money to the Clintons, their supposed equal partners in Whitewater.  This transfer could be treated as a gift, a loan, or income.  Although the Clintons would incur a tax liability only if the transfer was considered income, campaign laws required disclosure of all three categories, a requirement that had not been met with respect to the McDougals' contributions to Whitewater.  At one point, Mr. Foster complained to his friend and the Clintons' confidant, Susan Thomases, about the poor condition of the Clintons' Whitewater records.(200) 

<P>Mr. Foster was working on another matter involving the Clintons' financial investments in the months and days preceding his death.  On June 18, 1993, USA Today published an article on Hillary Clinton's investment in a limited partnership named Value Partners, managed by Smith Capital Management of Little Rock, Arkansas.(201)  The article noted the success of the investment for Mrs. Clinton, but erroneously reported that Mrs. Clinton's "investments are now held in a blind trust."(202)  A copy of the article was found in Mr. Foster's office following his death.  Mr. Foster personally circled two places where the article asserted that Mrs. Clinton's assets had been placed in a blind trust.  He sent copies of the article to Lisa Caputo, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary, Ricki Seidman, White House Deputy Communications Director,2  and Margaret Williams, Mrs. Clinton's Chief of Staff.  His handwritten comments identified a problem:  "The assets are not yet in a blind trust.  The document has been approved but is not signed yet, pending working out some details."(203)  The article apparently bothered Mr. Foster enough to prompt him to complain immediately to Bill Smith, the head of Smith Capital Management.  Smith replied apologetically that his company does not talk to the press about the First Lady's investment, "particularly during the recent flurry of articles and interviews regarding the holdings of health care stocks in Value Partners."(204)

<P>The "flurry of articles" concerned the strategy of Value Partners to profit by selling stocks "short."  A short-seller borrows stocks from his broker to sell at current market price, anticipating that the value of the stock will fall.  When the price does fall, the short-seller buys the lower-priced stock to return to his broker, profiting from the difference in price.  On May 31, 1993, the Wall Street Journal disclosed that Value Partners actively sold short several health care stocks.(205)  At this time, Mrs. Clinton was directing the administration's efforts to reform the nation's health care system.  The Administration's proposal depressed the value of health care stocks.3   Value Partners was structured as a limited partnership, and no evidence exists that Mrs. Clinton directed or reviewed the fund's investment decisions.  However, Mrs. Clinton's investment amounted to nearly $100,000 in a fund that dedicated 13% of its $1.3 million portfolio to short positions in health care stocks.(206)  Mrs. Clinton thus came under media criticism for personally benefiting from her high-profile public campaign. 

<P>In addition to an appearance of impropriety, the investment in Value Partner posed a potential legal problem.  Title 18, Section 208 of the United States Code exposes an executive officer or employee to felony liability for participating "personally and substantially" in a "particular matter" in which he is aware of a financial interest.  Mr. Foster apparently had advised Mrs. Clinton that she need not be concerned by this criminal statute because she was not an officer or employee of the executive branch.(207)  In reaching this conclusion, Mr. Foster apparently did not consult with the Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice, and ignored a contrary opinion issued by that office 17 years earlier.(208)  

<P>Mr. Foster's conclusion that the First Lady was not covered by government ethics laws also conflicted with the position of the White House in Association of American Physicians and Surgeons v. Clinton.(209) That litigation sought to compel the White House to release the documents and deliberations of Mrs. Clinton's health care task force.  The Federal Advisory Committee Act ("FACA") compels such public disclosure if a government agency, like the health care task force, consults advisers who are not government employees.(210)  The plaintiffs alleged that Mrs. Clinton is such a nongovernmental adviser and thus the records of the task force were covered by FACA.  In order to avoid disclosure, the White House argued that Mrs. Clinton was indeed a federal official and therefore FACA did not apply to the task force.  The United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit agreed with the White House.  Recognizing the potential spillover effect of the holding, however, the court cautioned in a footnote: "We do not need to consider whether Mrs. Clinton's presence on the Task Force violates . . . any conflict of interest statutes."(211)   

<P>The matter apparently weighed heavily in Mr. Foster's mind.  The Wall Street Journal, in a series of editorials, criticized Mr. Foster for his role with respect to the Health Care Task Force.(212)  Mr. Foster complained to James Lyons, a Foster friend and former legal adviser to the Clinton campaign, that "the press had been particular vicious in their attacks on members of the Rose Law Firm."(213)  In particular, Mr. Foster complained about criticisms for his handling of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons v. Clinton litigation.(214)  Mr. Lyons told the FBI in an interview:

<P>FOSTER won a victory for the Task Force (and by association, for HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON) on that matter and the Wall Street Journal accused him of "sharp tactics".  LYONS advised that the allegation really bothered Foster.(215)

In the note apparently discovered in Mr. Foster's briefcase six days after his death, Mr. Foster wrote, "The Wall Street Journal editors lie without consequence."(216) 

<P>Just before his suicide, Mr. Foster concentrated on finalizing plans to place the First Family's investments in a blind trust, which would have remedied the ethical and legal problems posed by the Value Partners investment.  In Mr. Foster's papers was a facsimile from Brantly Buck, a partner of the Rose Law Firm, who had been retained to assist in the creation of the blind trust.  The facsimile, dated July 19, 1993, the day before Mr. Foster's suicide, forwarded draft statements of financial objectives for the blind trust.  White House phone records indicated that Mr. Buck called Mr. Foster twice on the morning of his suicide.(217)

<P>Mr. Foster's phone log also showed that he received a call from James Lyons, the author of the Whitewater report for the Clinton campaign, at 11:11 a.m. on July 20, 1993, the morning of Mr. Foster's death.(218)  When contacted by the Park Police, Mr. Lyons said that he had spoken with Mr. Foster on July 18, and they had agreed to meet for dinner on July 21.  According to a Park Police report, "Lyons had told Foster he would call him and let him know when he would leave Denver and arrive in Washington.  This is the reason for the phone message on the morning of July 20, 1993."(219)  In a later interview with the FBI, Mr. Lyons provided more detail into his scheduled dinner with Mr. Foster.  Mr. Foster was very concerned about the Travelgate affair and regarded himself and Bill Kennedy as potential witnesses in the matter.  According to the FBI report, Mr. Foster "felt strongly that White House should hire outside counsel to be handling the Travelgate matter for this reason.  He also believed that he would be needing a personal attorney to represent him in the matter."(220)  It was to seek personal representation that Mr. Foster purportedly scheduled dinner with Mr. Lyons.  Mr. Foster, however, also complained to Mr. Lyons about the extent to which he and other members of the Counsel's office were handling personal matters for the Clintons:

<P>FOSTER believed that private sector attorneys should be handling many of the matters they [White House Counsel's office] were handling, both for ethical and workload reasons.  The CLINTON administration had called for a 25 percent cut.  Under the BUSH administration the Counsel's office had 18 to 20 lawyers at its peak and when CLINTON took office there were only 6 or 7.4   There were many discussions about the composition and character of the associates in the Counsel's office and everybody was spread incredibly thin.(221)

<P>Linda Tripp, Mr. Nussbaum's executive assistant, testified that she approached Mr. Nussbaum and questioned him, based on her experience in the previous administration, about the inordinate amount of time that Mr. Foster seemed to spend on the Clintons' personal matters.  Ms. Tripp believed that Mr. Foster worked mostly on personal matters for the Clintons.  According to Ms. Tripp, "I questioned the role of the deputy counsel in the Clinton Administration as opposed to what I had perceived it to be in the Bush Administration."(222)  Indeed, C. Boyden Gray, President Bush's White House Counsel testified that, under President Bush, "[p]ersonal, what I would call personal work, taxes, blind trusts, problems involving his residence, his house in Maine, for example, those matters would be handled by his private counsel.  How to deal with the book royalties from Mrs. Bush's book, for example; they would be handled by his personal lawyer."(223)  When asked why, Gray explained that "I don't think the taxpayers should pay for personal matters, I suppose, is the short way to answer it."(224)

<P>II.  The Traditional Independence of the White House Counsel's Office

<P>The Office of the White House Counsel originated from presidential custom.  The Reorganization Act of 1939,(225) which authorized the modern White House staff, did not mention a legal adviser to the President.  The first such legal adviser came to the White House under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  When Roosevelt was governor of New York, he had a close personal adviser in Samuel Rosenman, who held the title of "Counsel to the Governor."(226)  Upon his election as President, Roosevelt prevailed on Mr. Rosenman, then a judge on New York's highest court, to join his staff.  President Roosevelt wanted to give Mr. Rosenman the title of "Counsel to the President," the Washington equivalent of his title in Albany.  However, Attorney General Francis Biddle objected, "`on the grounds that such a title would undercut the role of the Attorney General as the President's chief legal adviser.'"(227)  Consequently, Mr. Rosenman was given the title of "Special Counsel to the President."

<P>Despite its origins in the personal, rather than institutional, needs of the President, the Counsel's office has become firmly established within the White House.(228)  The role of this office has varied from administration to administration.  Mr. Rosenman, consistent with the practice in Albany, served not just as President Roosevelt's legal counselor, but as one of his key advisers.  He was the principal speech writer and spent most of his time drafting the President's public statements--a task for which he recruited Clark Clifford as his assistant.

<P>Mr. Clifford continued the tradition as special counsel to President Truman.  He later recounted that his job was to do "[w]hatever the President wanted."   Mr. Clifford saw his role "as an adviser or counselor, and not as an administrator or bureaucrat."(229)  His advice to President Truman was not strictly legal, but often political.  Secretary of State Marshall complained to President Truman about Mr. Clifford's participation in White House discussions on U.S policy toward Palestine: "I fear that the only reason Clifford is here is that he is pressing a political consideration with regard to this issue.  I don't think politics should play any part in this."(230)  

<P>Similarly, Theodore Sorenson, special counsel to President Kennedy, and Harry McPherson, special counsel to President Johnson, were among the principal policy and political advisers to each president.  Both participated fully in the major deliberations of their administrations.  In 1985, when organizers of a conference of presidential chiefs of staff discovered that no such position existed in the White House under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, they invited the two advisers who most closely approximated that role, Mr. Sorenson and Mr. McPherson.(231)  Myer Feldman held the post, with the title of "Counsel to the President," for one year between Mr. Sorenson and Mr. McPherson.  For reasons unknown, Mr. McPherson retained the old title of Special Counsel.  When Richard Nixon became President, he appointed John Ehrlichman as "Counsel to the President."  A year later, however, the title was discarded again and three top advisers--Murray Chotiner, Harry Dent, and Charles Colson--held the title of "Special Counsel" simultaneously.

<P>In 1971, President Nixon appointed John Dean as White House Counsel and relied on Mr. Dean primarily for legal advice on particular matters.  While Lloyd Cutler, President Carter's White House Counsel, noted that his job primarily concerned the legal aspects of matters that came to the President's attention,(232) he also played a "Clark Clifford role" in the White House.(233)  That means that "I can dispense advice and get involved in any question that interests me."(234)  Even with Mr. Cutler, however, it was clear that the modern White House counsel was no longer the equivalent of the chief of staff, as Mr. Sorensen was under President Kennedy.  In the Reagan White House, each of the three successive counsels--Fred Fielding, Peter Wallison, and A.B. Culvahouse--reported to the President's respective chiefs of staff--James Baker, Donald Regan, and Howard Baker.  Although C. Boyden Gray reportedly enjoyed special influence in the Bush White House stemming from his long-standing relationship with the President, he generally viewed himself not as a political adviser, but as counsel on legal problems.(235)  

<P>Against this historical background, President Clinton appointed Bernard Nussbaum to head the Counsel's office.  In addition to being Counsel, Mr. Nussbaum held the honorific "Assistant to the President," a title not given to any previous holder of the office.  Mr. Nussbaum had worked with Mrs. Clinton--he as the senior lawyer, she as a young law school graduate--on the staff of the House Judiciary Committee Impeachment Inquiry, the Watergate Committee.(236)  By his own account, Mr. Nussbaum was among the President's inner circle of advisers and enjoyed free access to the President.  "I see the President any time I think it's reasonably necessary.  Unfortunately, it's been necessary too many times."(237)

<P>Mr. Nussbaum's background as a private lawyer defined where his loyalty laid as White House Counsel.  "When you're down to one client--the President--the only thing that counts is your relationship with that client."(238)5   When Mr. Nussbaum resigned from his office, he wrote to the President:

<P>As I know you know, from the day I became Counsel, my sole objective was to serve you well as effectively as I could, consistent with the rules of law, standards of ethics, and the highest traditions of the Bar. . . .  Unfortunately, as a result of controversy generated by those who do not understand, nor wish to understand the role and obligations of a lawyer, even one active as White House Counsel, I now believe I can best serve you by returning to private life.(239)

Mr. Nussbaum has explained elsewhere that "[t]he principal source of that misunderstanding, I think, is the failure to appreciate . . . that fact that the president's lawyer is a lawyer, and that every lawyer--even one representing the president in his official capacity--has an obligation to represent his client faithfully and zealously."(240)  Those who criticized his conduct in office "have it exactly backward:  The problem is not that lawyers who are in the public arena are too zealous in representing their clients; it is that they--and others in the public arena--are often not zealous enough, because of a fear of appearances, of negative publicity and, consequently, of unpopularity, of loss of position."(241)

<P>Whether or not Mr. Nussbaum is correct in his ethical vision or his assessment of the public interest, the mandate of Resolution 120 requires the Special Committee to answer a more immediate question: whether, in their zeal to serve and protect their clients, President and Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Nussbaum and other White House officials engaged in any improper conduct in handling the papers in Mr. Foster's office following his death.

 <H2>    SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE</H2>

<P>I.  The Contents of Vincent Foster's Office at the Time of his Death

<P>The full contents of Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death will perhaps never be known.  That is so because Mr. Nussbaum, in cleaning out the files in Mr. Foster's office following his death, did not prepare an inventory of materials reviewed or removed.  Stephen Neuwirth did prepare an inventory of certain files in Mr. Foster's office, but only after Mr. Nussbaum and Margaret Williams had removed certain files to President and Mrs. Clinton's private quarters on the third floor of the White House Residence.

<P>Deborah Gorham, Mr. Foster's secretary, testified that, in her first trip into Mr. Foster's office after his death, she opened the drawer containing the Clintons' personal documents.  "I saw Pendaflex folders and file folders, and I did not see an index that normally would have been there listing the names of the files."(242)  According to Ms. Gorham, she maintained "indexes for all file drawers, that I recall, and it listed the content, the names of each of the folders in each drawer."(243)  She did not see the index in the drawer, where she normally kept it. 

<P>The Special Committee took steps to locate this missing index.  The White House produced three indices of files in Foster's office.  A six-page index is dated July 22, 1993, on the first page.  The final page of the index contained the following listing:6 

<P><P>First Family - SF 278



<P><P>First Family - 1994 Income Tax

<P><P>Returns



<P><P>First Family - General



<P><P>HRC - CLE/Arkansas Law

<P><P>License 



<P><P>First Couple - Blind Trust

<P>

<P><P>First Family - Arkansas Home



<P><P>POTUS - Arkansas Office



<P><P>WJC - Passport



<P><P>WJC - Papers



<P><P>First Family - SF 278 pre-POTUS(244)

<P>The White House represented to the Special Committee that this index "was in a box identified by Tom Castleton as containing documents from Cabinet I of Mr. Foster's office."(245)  Ms. Gorham, however, testified that the document is not one that she would have created.  "Certainly the typeface, the font and the style and the names of the subjects are familiar, but on your first entry where it reads `First Family 1994 Income Tax,' the word `Returns,' which should be, I believe, a part of that sentence after `Tax,' has been returned to the left margin."(246)  Raising the specter that the index had been altered, Ms. Gorham testified that she would not have formatted her document in such a fashion.(247)

<P>The White House produced yet another six-page index, which was found apparently "in a box identified by Mr. Castleton as containing materials from Ms. Gorham's desk."(248)  The last page of this index contained the same list of files as in the first index described above.(249)7   However, the format of the list is different.  "First Family 1994 Income Tax Returns" and "HRC - CLE/Arkansas Law License" are each typed on one line, without left returns breaking up the entries--a format consistent with the way Ms. Gorham would have maintained the document.  Although the index "is consistent with the typeface and certainly the names of the subjects and the type font that was used," Ms. Gorham was not sure if she had prepared the document.(250)  This second index, like the first, was dated July 22, 1993, on the first page.  Ms. Gorham testified that "on the White House system, that date would have had to have been manually entered."(251)  Ms. Gorham also testified that she would not have revised the index after Mr. Foster's death,(252) and that she did not revise the index on July 22, 1993.(253)

<P>Neither index contained any reference to a file on Whitewater Development Corporation.  According to Ms. Gorham, she created her index file in the first two weeks of April, several months prior to Mr. Foster's death,(254) and the index listed all the files in the drawer containing the First Family's personal documents.(255)  She also remembered that the Whitewater file was among those in Foster's office at that time.(256)8 

<P>The third index(257) produced by the White House listed, among other things, the same ten files contained in the other two indices, but in a slightly different order and with an additional notation for certain files:

<P><P>POTUS - SF 278<BR>

<P><P>First Family - 1994 Income Tax Returns (removed)<BR>

<P><P>HRC - CLE/Arkansas Law License (removed)<BR>

<P><P>First Couple - Blind Trust (removed)<BR>

<P><P>First Family - Arkansas Home (removed)<BR>

<P><P>WJC - Papers (removed)<BR>

<P><P>First Family - SF278 pre-POTUS (removed)<BR>

<P><P>Clinton Mansion (removed)<BR>

<P><P>POTUS - Arkansas Office<BR>

<P><P>WJC - Passport(258)<BR>

<P>This index, labelled "VWF - Existing Files" on the first page, contained the following line on the last page: "Updated 10/25/93".  Like the other two indices, it did not contain any reference to a Whitewater file.  At the Special Committee's request, the White House conducted a search of the back-up disks and tapes of Ms. Gorham's files, downloaded when she left the White House in late 1993.  The third index was among the files contained in those disks and tapes, and the file directory information indicated that it was last updated on 10/25/93 at 2:14 p.m.  The first and second indices, however, were not among the files in Ms. Gorham's computer at the time it was downloaded.  An analysis of latent data on the computer's hard drive by an FBI expert yielded no additional useful information.(259)

<P>Ms. Gorham testified that she did not see the index she maintained for the Clintons' personal files in Foster's office on July 22, nor anytime thereafter.(260)  The Committee was never able to ascertain what happened to this index -- a critical piece of evidence concerning the contents of Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death.

<P>When Mr. Nussbaum reviewed documents in Mr. Foster's office on July 22 before Justice Department officials, he did not identify every document in the office, even generically, for the law enforcement officers.  His scatter-shot identification process frustrated the officers. 

<P>The following colloquy occurred at the Special Committee's August 1, 1995, hearing:

<P>Mr. Giuffra:  Do you believe that Ms. Nussbaum described every document in Mr. Foster's office?

<P>Mr. Markland:  No, sir, I don't.

<P>Mr. Giuffra:  So he only identified some of the documents that were contained in Mr. Foster's office?

<P>Mr. Markland:  Yes.  Or he would go through a file drawer and just broadly say that they were strictly White House business.(261)

Agent Salter corroborated Mr. Markland's testimony, telling the Special Committee: "No, I don't believe he had looked at everything in the office."(262)  Mr. Nussbaum maintained, however, that he described every file in the office, including the Clintons' personal files.  "I said these were Clinton personal files.  I said these involve investments, taxes, other financial matters and the like.  Included was a file on the Clintons' Whitewater real estate investment."(263)

<P>Two persons kept careful notes of the document review on July 22.  Michael Spafford took nine pages of handwritten notes apparently listing the files and documents that Mr. Nussbaum called out during the meeting.  His meticulous notes listed, for example, paper clips and scotch tape from Vince Foster's left drawers, and the contents of Mr. Foster's trash bag.(264)  Likewise, Cliff Sloan took 16 pages of notes during the meeting.(265)  The notes taken by Mr. Sloan, which he later typed up,(266) tracked Mr. Spafford's notes, but at times provided some more detail both in the number of items listed and in the description of each item.  Neither set of notes recorded the specific name of the files or any description of the documents eventually transferred to the White House residence and later to Williams & Connolly.  

<P>Senator Kerry specifically questioned Mr. Nussbaum about files located in Mr. Foster's credenza.  Mr. Nussbaum testified that he reviewed all of the files in the credenza and described them to the law enforcement officials.  "I said this is a tax file, or this is an investment file, like that.  I didn't describe every piece of paper in the file.  I would flip through the file to see if there's a suicide note or extortion note, but I would give a general description of the file and I would flip through the file."(267)  

<P>Mr. Spafford's and Mr. Sloan's notes of Mr. Nussbaum's review, however, cast doubt on Mr. Nussbaum's testimony.  Mr. Nussbaum provided detailed descriptions of a number of items in the credenza, while identifying the Clinton personal files--apparently the bulk of the files in the credenza--generally as "matters re First Family."(268)  Following are Mr. Spafford's handwritten notes of what Mr. Nussbaum described in the credenza:

<P>Credensa: on R<BR>

          mostly files re GC matters<BR>

<P>     Although Mr. Sloan's typed notes did not identify the various locations, the listing was similar to Mr. Spafford's:

     Card -(270)<BR>

     The files transferred to the White House Residence and eventually taken to Williams & Connolly included a file labelled "WHITEWATER DEVELOPMENT, Personal and Confidential VWF."  Law enforcement officials did not recall Mr. Nussbaum mentioning Whitewater during the review of documents in Mr. Foster's office on July 22,(271) and the notes taken by Mr. Sloan and Mr. Spafford contained no reference to a Whitewater file.9 

<P>Mr. Nussbaum claimed that he had no knowledge that Mr. Foster was working on any matter involving Whitewater.(272)  Mr. Nussbaum emphasized that "[t]he Whitewater matter, which subsequently became the focus of so much attention, was not on our minds or even in our consciousness in July 1993."(273)  He repeated that although Whitewater had surfaced briefly during the 1992 campaign, "in 1993, Whitewater was not on my screen, nor, as far as I know, was it the subject of discussion in the White House.  And if it was, it was something I would have known."(274)

<P>Evidence obtained by the Banking Committee during the summer of 1994 flatly contradicts Mr. Nussbaum's testimony.  Resolution Trust Corporation ("RTC") Senior Vice President William H. Roelle testified that, upon taking office, former Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Roger Altman directed the staff to inform him of all important or potentially high-visibility issues.(275)  According to Mr. Roelle, on or about March 23, 1993, he told Mr. Altman that the RTC had sent a criminal referral mentioning the Clintons to the Justice Department.(276)

<P>The White House produced files to the Banking Committee showing that Mr. Altman immediately sent Mr. Nussbaum two facsimiles about Whitewater.  The first facsimile, sent on March 23, 1993 with a handwritten cover sheet, forwarded an "RTC Clip Sheet" of a March 9, 1992 New York Times article with the headline, "Clinton Defends Real-Estate Deal."(277)  The article reported the responses that Bill Clinton, then a presidential candidate, offered to an earlier Times report detailing the Clintons' investment in Whitewater and their ties to Jim and Susan McDougal.

<P>The second facsimile from Mr. Altman to Mr. Nussbaum, sent the next day, March 24, 1993, forwarded the same article that was sent the day before and portions of the earlier Times report--an article dated March 8, 1992, by Jeff Gerth entitled "Clintons Joined S&L Operator in an Ozark Real-Estate Venture," which originally broke the story in the news media.(278)

<P>According to the report of the Banking Committee on the communications between officials of the White House and the Treasury Department:  

<P>Mr. Altman testified that he did not recall having sent either facsimile to Mr. Nussbaum.  Mr. Nussbaum testified that he did not recall having received either facsimile from Mr. Altman.  Mr. Altman and Mr. Nussbaum both testified that they had no recollection of having spoken to one another during March 1993 about the articles contained in the facsimiles or the subject of those articles.  Nevertheless, Mr. Altman and Mr. Nussbaum both testified that the facsimiles were apparently sent and received by their respective offices.(279)

<P>Before the Special Committee, Senator Bond asked Mr. Nussbaum specifically about the apparent contradiction between his assertion that he had no knowledge of Whitewater at the time of Mr. Foster's death and the existence of Mr. Altman's facsimiles.  Mr. Nussbaum maintained that he did not know of the facsimiles.(280)  He testified that he first heard of Whitewater in late September 1993.(281)  "So, in July of 1993, I had no knowledge and no memory of receiving a fax from Roger Altman, and Whitewater, as I said in my statement, was not on my mind nor, do I believe, on anyone else's mind in the White House in July of 1993."(282)

<P>There is further evidence, however, that Mr. Foster was not the only White House official working on personal matters for the Clintons involving Whitewater.  Until July of 1993, Ricki Seidman was Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Director of Communications.  She reported to the FBI in 1994 that she and Mr. Foster had worked together on Whitewater issues before his death:

<P>Seidman was asked about FOSTER's involvement with Whitewater.  She said the only Whitewater issue she could recall was in April, 1993 in connection with the CLINTONs tax returns.  The tax returns show that the CLINTONs had divested themselves of their interest in Whitewater.  SEIDMAN's involvement was from a "communications perspective".(283)

Ms. Seidman explained that she discussed various options with Mr. Foster for treating the transaction on the Clintons' 1992 tax returns.  Ms. Seidman confirmed notes found in Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death summarizing the three options under consideration: (1) report a loss on the Whitewater investment; (2) not report any gains or losses; or (3) declare a $1000 gain to the Clintons from their transfer of all Whitewater stock to Jim McDougal in December, 1992.(284)

<P>In addition, SBA Associate Administrator Wayne Foren testified that, in early May 1993, he briefed Erskine Bowles, the new SBA Administrator about the agency's ongoing investigation of David Hale's Capital Management Services because the case involved President Clinton.(285)  Shortly thereafter, Mr. Bowles told Mr. Foren that he had briefed White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty about the case.(286)  Although Mr. Bowles did not recall being briefed by Mr. Foren about Capital Management(287) or talking to Mr. McLarty about the case,(288) Mr. Foren's account was corroborated by his deputy, Charles Shepperson.(289)  Mr. McLarty's calendar indicated that Mr. Bowles had two meetings with Mr. McLarty at the White House in early May 1993.(290)

<P>When asked why Mr. Nussbaum prevented law enforcement officials from looking at documents in Mr. Foster's office on July 22, Detective Markland replied: "In my mind, at this time, I believe he was afraid we would have uncovered some indication of the Whitewater situation and other things that Mr. Foster was involved with that are just now coming to light."(291)

<P>Mr. Nussbaum claimed that he did not seek to conceal damaging information about the Whitewater matter.  In his view, the groundswell of interest in the handling of documents after Mr. Foster's death resulted from "the unfair linkage of two separate, disparate events,"(292) the way he reviewed and handled documents in Mr. Foster's office and the emergence of the Whitewater investigation in late 1993.(293)

<P>Yet, as early as the spring 1993, White House officials expected the then-dormant Whitewater issue to reemerge in the media.  According to the FBI report of Ms. Seidman's interview, in April 1993, "it was believed the tax returns would bring the Whitewater issue into the `public domain again'.  SEIDMAN said there was discussion regarding the `soundest way' to seek closure to the issue."(294)10   In addition to Ms. Seidman's sworn statement, common sense casts doubt on Mr. Nussbaum's testimony that Whitewater was not on the White House's radar screen in 1993.  Whitewater was a major issue in the 1992 campaign, and the Clintons went to the extraordinary step of retaining an outside attorney to issue a report on the matter.  The "unfair linkage," in Mr. Nussbaum's words, so obvious when investigations relating to Whitewater were reported later in 1993, was never made in the weeks following Mr. Foster's death precisely because Mr. Nussbaum concealed any mention of Whitewater from law enforcement officials.  There is little doubt that Mr. Nussbaum foresaw the embarrassment and political liability of such a linkage between Mr. Foster's death and Whitewater when he examined the documents in Mr. Foster's office.  It is against this backdrop of motive that the events and actions following Mr. Foster's death must be examined.



<P>II.  July 20, 1993

A.<P>The Discovery of Mr. Foster's Body.

<P>At about 5:30 p.m. on July 20, 1993, the driver of a white utility van stopped at Fort Marcy Park off the George Washington Parkway in Virginia to relieve himself.(295)  The man parked his car next to a white two-door Honda with a blue interior and Arkansas plates.(296)  He walked about 200 yards away from the parking lot.  As he was urinating, the man noticed the body of a white male wearing a white dress shirt and grey pants.(297)  Traces of blood were visible on the man's face, and the right shoulder was stained light purple.(298)

<P>The man then returned to his van to find a telephone.(299)  He drove to nearby Turkey Run Park, where he found two uniformed Park Service employees.(300)  He told the Park Service employees that he had found a body and asked one of them to call the police.(301)  One of the Park Service employees walked to a nearby telephone and called the police.(302)  

<P>The Fairfax County Public Safety Communications Center received a 911 call at approximately 6:00 p.m. on July 20, 1993, reporting a dead body lying near a cannon in Fort Marcy Park.(303)  The dispatcher relayed this information to the Park Police and the Fairfax County Emergency Response Team.(304)  Park Police Officer Kevin Forshill responded to the call from his post in Langley, Virginia.(305)  Officer Forshill and two medical technicians searched the area near the two cannons, while another group of medical technicians searched elsewhere in the park.(306)  Near the second cannon, Officer Forshill found the body.(307)  He then notified the dispatcher and requested detectives to be at the scene.

<P>Park Police investigators Renee Apt, Cheryl Braun, and John Rolla responded to Officer Forshill's call at 6:35 p.m.(308)  Sergeant Braun, the senior investigator, assigned Detective Rolla to investigate the death scene while she examined the parking lot.  Their preliminary view was that Mr. Foster's death was a suicide.(309)  Under standard procedure, however, the Park Police treated the investigation as a possible homicide.  The Park Police continued to treat the investigation as a possible homicide until August 10, 1993, when the Park Police officially ruled Mr. Foster's death a suicide.(310) 

<P> In a death investigation, standard procedures called for investigators to define the crime scene and to prevent any unauthorized access to the area.(311)  In the case of a suspected suicide, the investigators considered relevant "the person's home, their office, their car, places where they frequent would be relevant; any place where they would leave information about them, their state of mind, a place for them to leave their note, if they leave a note." (312)  As a necessary precaution, such places should be preserved "as a matter of routine police procedure" in order to ensure the integrity of the evidence.(313)  Sergeant Braun thus immediately requested that the main gate of the fort be closed to prevent entries into the area.(314)

<P>When Detective Rolla arrived at the death scene, the area around Mr. Foster's body was taped off.(315)  The officers who first arrived on the scene briefed Detective Rolla and gave him several Polaroid photographs of the scene.(316)  Detective Rolla then made a careful visual examination of the body and conducted a thorough inventory of the physical evidence on the body.(317)  Detective Rolla then took his own Polaroid pictures of the crime scene and, when the Fairfax County Medical Examiner arrived, helped him move the body for a preliminary examination.(318)

<P>Sergeant Braun interviewed a couple whose car was parked near Mr. Foster's Honda, and another officer canvassed the area for other witnesses.(319)  All the items in Mr. Foster's car were catalogued: a wallet with $300 in cash, his White House identification, and a piece of paper with the names and telephone numbers of three doctors; two empty beer bottles, a canvas bag, a folded map of Washington D.C., and cassette tapes in the car interior; Mr. Foster's daughter's college papers and textbooks in the trunk; and sunglasses and empty cigarette boxes in the glove compartment.(320)  With the discovery of Mr. Foster's White House identification, Sergeant Braun considered the case a high priority investigation and proceeded with heightened caution.(321)  After Sergeant Braun finished examining Mr. Foster's car, it was sealed with tape and towed to the Anacostia Station of the Park Police.(322)  A Park Police officer accompanied the car to the station to ensure that its contents would not be disturbed.(323)

B.<P>The Park Police Notify the White House and the Foster Family. 

<P>After Sergeant Braun and Detective Rolla finished their investigation at the scene, the shift commander asked them to call the White House.  The investigators contacted White House Security Chief Craig Livingstone and White House Associate Counsel William Kennedy, both of whom went to the hospital to identify Mr. Foster's body.  After Mr. Kennedy confirmed Mr. Foster's identity at the hospital, he called White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty, Counsel Bernard Nussbaum, and Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell.(324)

<P>Sergeant Braun and Detective Rolla made plans to notify the Foster family and were requested to pick up David Watkins, Assistant to the President for Management and Administration, to assist in the notification.(325)  They arrived at the Foster residence between 10:00 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.(326)  A few minutes later, Webster Hubbell, his wife, and Mr. Foster's sisters, Sharon Foster and Sheila Anthony, arrived at the Foster home.(327)  While the friends and relatives waited on the lawn, Sergeant Braun and Detective Rolla informed Mrs. Foster and her daughter Laura of Mr. Foster's death.(328)  The friends rushed to console the visibly upset family.  

<P>Park Police investigators were still attempting to continue their investigation.  Typically, the death notification involves an attempt to determine whether there was evidence of foul play and to ask the family about the victim's finances, mental state, domestic relations, health problems, and use of medication.(329)  After a brief interview yielded no useful information,(330) Detective Rolla asked Mrs. Foster to look for a note or anything out of the ordinary and to contact the police if she found anything.(331)  At approximately 11:00 p.m., President Clinton arrived at the Foster residence.  Feeling that they would get no further information from the family, Sergeant Braun and Detective Rolla left shortly thereafter, at about 11:10 p.m.(332)

C.<P>The White House Ignores Repeated Park Police Requests to Seal Mr. Foster's Office.<P>  As Sergeant Braun was leaving the Foster residence after the President arrived on July 20, she pulled David Watkins aside and asked him to seal Mr. Foster's office.  Because the investigators did not find, at Fort Marcy or at the Foster home, a note or any other evidence indicating why Mr. Foster might have taken his own life, they considered Mr. Foster's White House office, the last known place where he was seen alive, to be a part of the overall crime scene.(333)  Sergeant Braun testified that, from the investigation of the death scene and the interviews with the Foster family, the Park Police "did not get any information that would confirm that Mr. Foster was depressed or had even discussed the possibility of committing suicide with any of his friends or relatives."(334)  Mr. Foster's office, therefore, became highly relevant to the investigation.  "So I felt that that may be a place where Mr. Foster may have left a note, would be at his office, maybe for his co-workers to find rather than for his wife."(335)  Detective Rolla agreed with Sergeant Braun:  "And then, having not been able to get any information as to his state of mind from the family, no knowledge that they had found a note or anything, his place of business becomes the next logical place to go, as I said earlier."(336)  The Park Police believed that Mr. Watkins, who had provided the officers with a White House business card indicating that he was "Assistant to the President for Management and Administration,"(337) possessed the authority to direct that Mr. Foster's office be sealed.(338)

<P>Once the Park Police determined that the focus of their investigation should shift to Mr. Foster's office, the police sought "to preserve [the office] in the condition that he left it."(339)  According to Sergeant Braun, Mr. Watkins agreed to secure Mr. Foster's office.(340)  Detective Rolla corroborated Sergeant Braun's recollection: 

<P>She asked him to secure the office because we knew the situation was that we weren't going to be able to be in there that night.  And just to have things maintained, we wanted it secured until such time as higher officials could get in there and be gone through properly.(341)

Mr. Watkins denied that the Park Police asked him to take steps to seal Mr. Foster's office.(342) 

<P>Major Robert Hines of the Park Police learned of Mr. Foster's death at approximately 9:45 p.m. on July 20.(343)  Lieutenant Gavin, the shift commander, called to request that Major Hines contact Deputy Assistant to the President William Burton.(344)  Major Hines then called Mr. Burton and requested that he seal Mr. Foster's office.  "We needed to go into the office and look for any kind of reasons or intention that Mr. Foster may have to commit suicide."(345)  To ensure that such a search would be fruitful, the office should not be contaminated.  "I would expect when we said seal the office, that the office would be closed, it would be secured and no one would be entering the office."(346)  Sylvia Mathews, a White House aide, confirmed that she overheard a conversation between Mr. Burton and the Park Police that evening.(347)  Following the conversation, Mr. Burton asked Mr. Nussbaum to seal Mr. Foster's office.(348)  Ms. Mathews' contemporaneous notes of the evening stated: "At that point, Bill said we should get Bernie and lock the office.  I am uncertain what time that was, but probably after 10:00 p.m.  I don't remember who told Bernie, but he went up and locked the office."(349)

<P>Notwithstanding the testimony of Major Hines and Ms. Mathews, Mr. Burton and Mr. Nussbaum denied that they had been asked to seal Mr. Foster's office.(350)

<P>Both Webster Hubbell's wife and Marsha Scott, a White House official and a friend of the Hubbells, remembered that Mr. Hubbell called either David Watkins or Mack McLarty on the night of Mr. Foster's death to request that his office be sealed.(351)  In a press briefing several days later, Dee Dee Myers identified Mr. McLarty as the person who directed that Mr. Foster's office be sealed.(352)

<P>David Gergen testified that, after leaving the Foster residence, he went to the White House at around midnight.(353)  In the White House kitchen, he and Mr. McLarty discussed sealing Mr. Foster's office.(354)  Mr. Gergen then spoke by telephone with Mark Gearan, the White House Communications Director.  He asked Mr. Gearan, who was in his office on the first floor of the West Wing, whether the office had been sealed.  According to Mr. Gergen, Mr. Gearan checked, and "[h]e came back to me and said, yes, the office has been sealed."(355)  Mr. Gearan testified that, when Mr. Gergen asked him whether Mr. Foster's office was locked, he asked Mr. Burton about it.  Mr. Burton told Mr. Gearan that the office was locked, and Mr. Gearan relayed this information to Mr. Gergen.(356)

<P>Mr. Burton did not recall this conversation.(357)

<P>Even though White House officials had received several requests from law enforcement and an internal White House request, Mr. Foster's office was not sealed on the evening of July 20.

D.<P>Mrs. Clinton Learns of Mr. Foster's Death and Begins to Contact Close Associates.

<P>After learning of Mr. Foster's death, Mr. McLarty called Hillary Clinton, who was travelling from Los Angeles to Arkansas that evening.  Mrs. Clinton's plane landed in Little Rock at approximately 8:30 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time.(358)  Mrs. Clinton then proceeded to her mother's home in Little Rock.  Between 9:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m., a Secret Service agent told Lisa Caputo, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary, that Mr. McLarty was calling by telephone.(359)  Mr. McLarty then told Ms. Caputo that he needed to speak privately to Mrs. Clinton.  When Mrs. Clinton came on the line, Mr. McLarty informed her of Mr. Foster's death.(360)  Mr. McLarty confirmed that he notified Mrs. Clinton some time after 9:00 p.m., after her plane landed in Arkansas.(361)

<P>Margaret Williams, Mrs. Clinton's chief of staff, testified that she received two phone calls from Mrs. Clinton on the evening of July 20.  "The first call she was on the plane and said that -- she must have called through Signal because I thought she said are you at home.  And she said are you going to be there, and I said yes.  And she said I will call you when I land."(362)  After the plane landed, Mrs. Clinton called Ms. Williams again and informed her of Mr. Foster's death.(363)  Telephone records from the Rodham residence confirm that Mrs. Clinton called Ms. Williams on July 20 at 10:13 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time and spoke for 16 minutes.(364)  It was the first telephone call that Mrs. Clinton made after learning of Mr. Foster's death.

<P>The Rodham residence telephone records indicate that, after talking with Ms. Williams, Mrs. Clinton called the residence of Harry Thomason and Susan Bloodworth-Thomason in Carpinteria, California, for four minutes.(365)  Mr. Thomason, a long-time friend of the Clintons, was involved in the Travel Office affair that apparently weighed heavily on Mr. Foster's mind at the time of his death.  Mrs. Clinton next called Susan Thomases in New York and spoke for 20 minutes.  Ms. Thomases, who had played a key  role in Whitewater damage control during the 1992 presidential campaign, testified that she and Mrs. Clinton commiserated each other about Mr. Foster's death, and that they did not discuss the handling of papers in Mr. Foster's office.(366)

E.<P>Mrs. Clinton Calls the White House on an Unlisted Trunk Line.<P>

<P>Mrs. Clinton next called the number 202-628-7087 and spoke for 10 minutes.(367)  The Committee was forced to go to considerable lengths to identify to whom Mrs. Clinton placed this call.  Counsel for Mrs. Clinton and the White House represented to the Special Committee that, despite undertaking every effort available, they were unable to determine the identity of the person whom Mrs. Clinton called at 202-628-7087.  The telephone company also could not identify the person or entity registered to that number.11 

<P>On November 30, 1995, the Special Committee then issued a set of interrogatories to Mrs. Clinton, exploring her knowledge and recollection of the identity of the person or persons she called at 202-628-7087.12   On December 7, 1995, Mrs. Clinton submitted a sworn affidavit to the Special Committee, attesting that "I do not remember calling the number 202-628-7087 that evening.  I understand that the number is an auxiliary White House switchboard number.  It would not surprise me to learn that I had placed a call to the White House that evening."

<P>On December 7, 1995, the White House advised the Special Committee that "the telephone number (202) 628-7087 was an unlisted trunk line that rang on the White House switchboard. . . .  The number was also used as a means to get through to the White House when the switchboard was overloaded, and may have been provided to certain individuals for the purpose." 

<P>The White House further advised that "we understand that Bill Burton remembers receiving a call in the Chief of Staff's office from Mrs. Clinton on the evening of July 20 and speaking with her about Vincent Foster's death."  Tellingly, Mr. Burton had omitted this conversation when he first testified before the Committee.  In his second appearance, Mr. Burton testified with a refreshed recollection:

<P>I was in Mr. McLarty's private office most of the evening, and at some point that night I received a call from the First Lady.  I don't remember if I answered the phone or if Ms. Mathews answered the phone and transferred the call in to me or if someone else answered the phone and transferred the call into me.  I don't remember who called. 



<P>It was the First Lady, and we had a personal conversation about Mr. Foster's death, and it lasted about 10 or 15 minutes to the best of my recollection.(368)

Sylvia Mathews, who was in the Chief of Staff's office with Mr. Burton, did not recall observing Mr. Burton speaking on the telephone with Mrs. Clinton, nor did he discuss with her at any time about his conversation with Mrs. Clinton.  She testified that "I was away from the desk, as we discussed previously, several times."(369)

<P>After calling the White House, Mrs. Clinton called Carolyn Huber.(370)  Ms. Huber, Assistant to the First Lady and Director of White House Correspondence, was the former administrator of the Rose Law Firm and would later discover in the White House Residence the long-missing Rose Law Firm billing records reflecting its work for James McDougal's Madison Guaranty.  Mrs. Clinton spoke with Mrs. Huber for four minutes, and then called a family member in Washington, D.C.(371)  In her seventh and final call of the night, Mrs. Clinton called the President at 1:09 a.m. in the White House Residence and spoke to him for 13 minutes.(372)

F.<P>Helen Dickey's Telephone Call to the Arkansas Governor's Mansion.

<P>Helen Dickey worked for Governor Clinton in Arkansas as the assistant to the governor's mansion administrator.(373)  She became staff assistant to the White House Social Secretary.(374)  Between January 1993 and November 1994, Ms. Dickey lived in a suite of rooms in the northeast corner of the third floor of the White House Residence.

<P>Ms. Dickey testified that, on July 20, 1993, she returned to the White House Residence some time between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. and went to her rooms.(375)  Records maintained by the Secret Service indicate that Ms. Dickey entered the White House Residence at 7:32 p.m.(376)  She left her suite at some point to go to the solarium, also on the third floor, to watch the President's appearance on Larry King Live.  The show started at 9:00 p.m.(377)  At some point during the show, John Fanning, a White House doorman, entered the solarium and told Ms. Dickey that Mr. Foster had committed suicide.(378)  

<P>Ms. Dickey, visibly shaken, went to the second floor kitchen and called her mother from the kitchen telephone.  After talking with her mother for two to three minutes, Ms. Dickey called her father, who lived in a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia.(379)  She then went back up to the third floor and, at some point, returned to the second floor kitchen to find the President, who had finished his interview with Larry King.(380)  The President told Ms. Dickey that "Vince Foster had shot himself in a park."(381)  After her two to three minute conversation with the President, Ms. Dickey returned to the third floor.  Ms. Dickey made three calls from the telephone in the hallway of the third floor of the Residence.  One call went to Ann Stock, Ms. Dickey's former supervisor as the Arkansas Governor's Mansion administrator, and another went to Ann McCoy, her supervisor as the White House Social Secretary.(382)  She talked to each for no more than five minutes.(383)  

<P>Ms. Dickey then placed the third telephone call to the Arkansas Governor's Mansion at 501-376-6884.(384)  Roger Perry, an Arkansas State Trooper on duty at the mansion, answered the telephone.  Ms. Dickey testified that she stated to Trooper Perry:  "I called just to let you know that Vince Foster has committed suicide.  I just wanted you all to know before you heard it on the news."(385)  According to Ms. Dickey, Trooper Perry "showed signs of being shocked and being very sad."(386)  The entire conversation lasted approximately two to three minutes.(387)  Her best estimate of the time of the call to the Governor's Mansion was 10:30 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time.(388)

<P>During its investigation, the Special Committee received an affidavit from Roger Perry.  In relevant part, the affidavit stated:

<P>On the 20th day of July, 1993, I received a telephone call from a person known to me as Helen Dickey.  I was working in the security detail at the Arkansas Governor's mansion in Little Rock, Arkansas at that time.  Dickey advised me that Vincent Foster, well knew [sic] to me had gotten off work and had gone out to his car in the parking lot and had shot himself in the head.  I do not recall the exact time of this telephone call but am fairly certain it was some time from about 4:30 p.m. to no later than 7:00 p.m.  [Central Daylight Time]

The Special Committee also received affidavits from Larry Patterson and Lynn Davis, also of the Arkansas State Police.  Trooper Patterson stated that he had received a telephone call from Trooper Perry on July 20, 1993.  Trooper Perry told him that Ms. Dickey had called and said Vincent Foster "had gotten off work and had gone out to his car in the parking lot  and shot himself in the head."  Trooper Patterson did not recall the exact time of Trooper Perry's telephone call but was "fairly certain it was some time before 6:00 p.m." Central Daylight Time.  Captain Davis likewise stated in his affidavit that Trooper Perry called him on July 20, 1993, to say that Ms. Dickey had called him and said that Vincent Foster "had gone to his car on the parking lot and had shot himself in the head."  According to Captain Davis, "I estimate the time as being no later than six o'clock, Central Standard [sic] Time."

<P>To resolve the discrepancy between Ms. Dickey's testimony and the sworn affidavits of Messrs. Perry, Patterson and Davis, the Special Committee attempted to obtain records of telephone communications between the White House and the Arkansas Governor's Mansion on July 20, 1993.  The White House advised that "no such call was made from the private telephone lines in the Executive Residence."(389)  The call may have been placed, however, through the White House or Signal switchboard.  Ms. Dickey testified that she recalled placing the call through the White House operator.(390)  On October 13, 1995, White House advised that "[w]e have obtained records of long-distance calls placed through the Signal switchboard, and have confirmed that no call to the Governor's Mansion was made through the Signal switchboard on July 20, 1993."(391)  The White House also advised that Sprint, the provider of long distance service through the White House switchboard, did not retain records of individual long-distance telephone calls.(392)

<P>After additional inquiries, the Special Committee discovered that the White House was mistaken.  Sprint indeed retained some records of individual telephone calls placed through the White House switchboard.  The Special Committee thus issued a subpoena on November 20, 1995, to obtain such records and was initially advised that the records reflected the destination number to which a telephone call was placed, but not the extension in the White House from which the call originated.(393)  Sprint subsequently advised that its records only reflect the first six digits of the destination number, that is, the area code and prefix, and not the last four digits of the destination number.(394)  Because the Governor's mansion does not have an exclusive prefix, it is not possible to determine from the records produced by Sprint to the Special Committee when Ms. Dickey placed the phone call.

<P>After further inquiry by the Special Committee, however, the White House advised that "[w]e have confirmed that a call to Ms. Dickey's father's telephone number in Georgia was made at 10:06 p.m. on July 20, 1993, from one of the private lines in the Residence."(395)  Ms. Dickey testified that she called her father before calling the Arkansas Governor's mansion.(396)  Ms. Dickey also denied that she told the troopers that Vincent Foster had gone to his car in the parking lot and shot himself in the head.  According to Ms. Dickey: "That's absolutely not true. . . . I never heard that, I never would have said that because that's not the facts as I knew them at that time.  I'm absolutely positive of the timing of this."(397)

G.<P>The Handling of Trash and Burn Bags in Mr. Foster's Office.

<P>During the course of the evening, Sylvia Mathews determined that she should retrieve the trash from Mr. Foster's office in case it contained evidence relevant to his death.  According to Ms. Mathews, "I consulted with senior staff around and said should we examine the contents and was told -- I don't remember the exact words or who said what, but generally encouraged to go ahead and look through the trash."(398)  Ms. Mathews specifically recalled Bill Burton being present for this discussion.(399)  The trash had already been collected by the cleaning staff, but Ms. Mathews retrieved it.  After locating what she believed to be Mr. Foster's trash, Ms. Mathews prepared an inventory and found nothing significant.(400)  At Bill Burton's request, she placed the trash in the office of Roy Neel, the Deputy White House Chief of Staff.(401)  Mr. Nussbaum testified that Ms. Mathews asked him if she should recover the trash from Mr. Foster's office.  He then told her to go ahead and to store the trash in Roy Neel's office.(402) 

<P>Ms. Mathews also wanted to recover Mr. Foster's burn bag.  The burn bag, a receptacle used for sensitive materials to be destroyed, is collected daily by the Secret Service.  Secret Service officer Henry P. O'Neill was responsible for emptying the individual burn bags into a larger burn bag to be processed.(403)  Officer O'Neill testified that he brought this co-mingled burn bag, which contained the papers of several offices, to the Chief of Staff's suite and gave it to Ms. Mathews.  Officer O'Neill believed that this bag did not contain anything from the White House Counsel's suite or from Vincent Foster's office.(404)  When he had gone to empty the burn bags in the counsel's suite with the cleaning staff earlier that evening, he had been interrupted by Bernard Nussbaum entering the suite.(405)  Officer O'Neill never had a chance to empty the burn bags, because the suite was occupied that evening.  

<P>Bill Burton then instructed Ms. Mathews to check with Mr. Nussbaum before examining the contents of the co-mingled burn bags.(406)  Mr. Nussbaum told Ms. Mathews that Mr. Foster's office did not have a burn bag.(407)  Mr. Nussbaum instructed Ms. Mathews to return the burn bag because it contained materials co-mingled from other offices in the White House.(408)  Ms. Mathews then returned the bag to Officer O'Neill and told him to proceed as usual.(409)  Mr. Nussbaum did not recall discussing the burn bag with Ms. Mathews.(410)

H.<P>Senior White House Officials Conduct a Late-Night Search of Mr. Foster's Office.

<P>Even though the Park Police made two requests to seal Mr. Foster's office, three White House senior officials conducted a search of his office on the night of July 20.   

<P>Patsy Thomasson, David Watkins' deputy, received the following message on her pager at 10:34  p.m. on July 20: "PLEASE PAGE DAVID WATSKINS [sic] WITH YOUR LOCATION".(411)  Ms. Thomasson was at Sequoia Restaurant, minutes from the Foster residence in Georgetown.  When Ms. Thomasson reached Mr. Watkins, he told her that Mr. Foster was dead.(412)  Ms. Thomasson then asked him, "[I]s there anything I can do to help?  Do I need to be where you are?  What do I need to do?"(413)  Rather than asking Ms. Thomasson to take steps to seal Mr. Foster's office, as the Park Police had specifically requested Mr. Watkins to do, he instructed Ms. Thomasson to go into Mr. Foster's office at the White House to look for a suicide note.(414)  Ms. Thomasson arrived at the White House at 10:48  p.m.(415) 

<P>White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum was finishing dinner at Galileo's, a restaurant several minutes from the White House, when he was paged by the White House on July 20.  When he returned the page, Mark Gearan told him that Mr. Foster was dead.(416)  Mr. Nussbaum went directly to the White House,(417) where he encountered the President and Mack McLarty on their way to the Foster residence.(418)  According to Mr. Nussbaum, he then went to his office to make telephone calls to notify his staff of Mr. Foster's death.  At about 10:45 p.m., Mr. Nussbaum reached the White House Counsel's suite, where both his office and Mr. Foster's office are located.  On his way there, "it occurred to me that perhaps Vince left a note telling us why he had taken his life."(419)

<P>Margaret Williams, Chief of Staff to the First Lady, testified that she received the news of Mr. Foster's death from Mrs. Clinton.  Telephone records indicated that this call came at 10:13 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time and lasted 16 minutes.  When she hung up with Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Williams called her mother(420) and Evelyn Lieberman, her assistant.(421)  Ms. Lieberman, who lived near Ms. Williams, went to Ms. Williams' house and drove her to the White House.  Ms. Williams did not recall why she went to the White House beyond the fact that "I just knew everybody else would be there."(422)  When the two arrived at the White House, Ms. Williams asked Ms. Lieberman to remain in the foyer of Mrs. Clinton's office to answer the phones.  Ms. Williams went to Mr. Gearan's office to review a press statement and then went to her own office, which was down the hall from Mr. Foster's office, to get a copy of Mrs. Clinton's schedule.  

<P>All evening, I had been avoiding looking in the direction of Vince's office as I entered and left the First Lady's suite.  But in a strange way, when I saw the light on in his office, I had this hope, albeit irrational, that I would walk in and I would find Vince Foster there and we would have a chat sitting on his couch, as we have done so many times before.(423)

<P>Ms. Thomasson, Mr. Nussbaum, and Ms. Williams all admitted that they entered Mr. Foster's office on the evening of July 20.  Their stories fall apart after that.  Each provided testimony that was inconsistent with the other two.  And, their testimony was contradicted the testimony of career Secret Service officer Henry P. O'Neill, the watch officer for that evening, and contemporaneous Secret Service records.

<P>Ms. Thomasson testified that, after placing her personal belongings in her office, she went to the second floor on the West Wing of the White House.(424)  There, she encountered Mr. Nussbaum in the hallway and told him that Mr. Watkins had asked her to look for a suicide note in Mr. Foster's office.(425)  She and Mr. Nussbaum then walked together into Mr. Foster's unsecured office.(426)  The cleaning lady was leaving the suite as Mr. Nussbaum and Ms. Thomasson entered.(427)  Ms. Thomasson then did a quick search for a note.  "I sat at Vince's desk, opened the drawers to the desk to see if there was anything that looked like a suicide note.  I looked in the top of his briefcase, which was sitting on the floor.  I didn't see anything."(428)  According to Ms. Thomasson, Mr. Nussbaum walked out for a moment, and Ms. Williams came in and began to cry on the couch.(429)  After a few minutes Ms. Williams left the office.  Mr. Nussbaum then came back in the office and suggested that they "probably should get out of here at that point."(430)  Ms. Thomasson and Mr. Nussbaum then left Mr. Foster's office together.(431)  She then paged Mr. Watkins, at 11:36 p.m., to report that she had found no note in Mr. Foster's office.(432)<P>

<P>Mr. Nussbaum offered a markedly different recollection.  When he reached the Counsel's suite at around 10:45 p.m., the door was open.  He did not arrive with Ms. Thomasson, as Mr. Thomasson has claimed.  Instead, Ms. Thomasson and Mr. Williams were already in Mr. Foster's office.  Ms. Williams was sitting on the sofa crying, and Ms. Thomasson was sitting behind Mr. Foster's desk.  They told Nussbaum that they had just arrived, and Ms. Thomasson told Mr. Nussbaum that she was searching for a suicide note.  According to Mr. Nussbaum, "Patsy and I checked the surfaces in Vince's office.  We opened a drawer or two looking for a note. . . . The three of us then left the office.(433)  He claimed that the search lasted no more than ten minutes,(434)13  and that the three then left Mr. Foster's office together.(435)  Mr. Nussbaum then went next door to his office to make some phone calls.14   When he left about an hour later, he locked and alarmed the Counsel's suite.(436)  

<P>Ms. Williams contradicted the testimony of both Ms. Thomasson and Mr. Nussbaum.  She testified that when she entered Mr. Foster's office, Ms. Thomasson was already sitting at Mr. Foster's desk.  Ms. Williams sat on the couch and commiserated with Ms. Thomasson.  Mr. Nussbaum entered the office later, obviously upset.(437)  After a brief time in the office, Mr. Nussbaum left, and Ms. Williams followed shortly thereafter.(438)  According to Ms. Williams, Ms. Thomasson remained in the office after both Mr. Nussbaum and Ms. Williams left.(439)

<P>Ms. Thomasson, Mr. Nussbaum, and Ms. Williams thus differed as to the critical sequence of entries into and exits from Mr. Foster's office on the evening of July 20.  Ms. Thomasson testified that she entered and exited Mr. Foster's office together with Mr. Nussbaum and suggested that at no time was she alone in the office.15   Mr. Nussbaum testified that he entered Mr. Foster's office after Ms. Thomasson and Ms. Williams; the three left the office together; and, after stopping by his office to make some phone calls, Mr. Nussbaum locked and alarmed the suite.  Ms. Williams testified that she entered after Ms. Thomasson and before Mr. Nussbaum, and that she exited shortly after Mr. Nussbaum, leaving Ms. Thomasson alone again in the office.

I.<P>Secret Service Officer Henry O'Neill Observes Margaret Williams Remove Documents from Mr. Foster's Office.

<P>Henry P. O'Neill joined the Secret Service Uniformed Division in 1977 and has been assigned to the White House since May of that year.  On the evening of July 20, 1993, he arrived at work at 6:30 p.m., several hours before his scheduled shift at 10:30 p.m., in anticipation of some voluntary overtime hours.  He made his regular rounds with the cleaning staff.(440)  He accompanied the cleaning staff to the White House Counsel's suite and disarmed the alarm at 10:42 p.m.(441)  As he reached the door of the suite, Officer O'Neill made a radio call to the uniformed division control center.  The center acknowledged the call, and Officer O'Neill unlocked the door and entered.(442)  "I flip the light switch on in the reception area.  Then I walk to the right into Mr. Foster's -- at that time, the deputy counsel's office, and behind the doorway there's an alarm switch, and you just flip the switch into access or open."(443)  He then let the cleaning crew in.

<P>Officer O'Neill proceeded into Mr. Nussbaum's office and checked the burn bag.(444)  He did not check Mr. Foster's office for a burn bag because as he walked back into the reception area, "I recognized Mr. Nussbaum as I turned to the right.  He walked into his office, and just about the same time I noticed other figures walk in behind him and I heard women's voices.  And so I directed the cleaning ladies to exit the suite, and I left the suite also."(445)16   Officer O'Neill could not identify exactly who, or how many people were accompanying Mr. Nussbaum into the suite.  He was certain, however, that he heard women's voices and that Mr. Nussbaum was not alone as he entered the suite.<P>  The Secret Service officer then left the Counsel's suite and walked to the legislative affairs office.  He was on his way back to alarm the Chief Counsel's suite when he ran into Howard Pastor, the Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs, who informed him of Mr. Foster's death.  As Officer O'Neill approached the Counsel's suite he saw Ms. Lieberman, Ms. Williams' assistant, leaving the suite.(446)  She asked Officer O'Neill to lock up the office.  He replied that he would take care of it.(447)  Officer O'Neill then rode the elevator with Ms. Lieberman down to the ground floor to inform his supervisor of Mr. Foster's death.  While he was on the phone, he overheard Ms. Lieberman asking Officer James Shea to ensure that the Counsel's suite was locked.(448)  Officer O'Neill told Shea that he knew of the request and would secure the office.(449)

<P>When Officer O'Neill returned to secure the White House counsel's suite, he found Patsy Thomasson sitting behind Vince Foster's desk.17   He "stopped in the doorway immediately walking into the office because as I looked to the left there was a woman sitting at the desk."(450)  Officer O'Neill went back to the first floor.  He returned to the Counsel's suite for a third time and again saw Ms. Lieberman coming out of the counsel's suite.  She asked him again to lock Mr. Foster's office.  According to Officer O'Neill:

<P>And then a few seconds after I saw her [Lieberman] come out, Mr. Nussbaum walked out behind her and walked through the hallway towards the stairs, past the elevator, and within a few more seconds I saw Maggie Williams walk out of the suite and turn to the right in the direction that I was standing.(451)



As Ms. Williams walked past Officer O'Neill to her office Ms. Lieberman told him "'that's Maggie Williams; she's the First Lady's chief of staff.'"(452)  

<P>Officer O'Neill observed Ms. Williams carrying file folders out of the Counsel's suite when he saw her on the night of Mr. Foster's death:  

<P>She was carrying what I would describe in her arms and hands, as folders.  She had them down in front of her as she walked down to her - in the direction of where I was standing.



<P><P>* * *



<P>She walked past me, and she continued on down the hallway.  It's only about 20 feet at the most. And she started to enter her office, and she had to brace the folders in her arm on a cabinet, and then she entered the office and came out within a few seconds and locked the door.(453)  



The folders were of "some weight, 3 to 5 inches."(454)  Officer O'Neill was certain that he saw Ms. Williams carrying folders out of the Counsel's suite that evening.(455)  After leaving the folders in her office, Ms. Williams joined Ms. Lieberman outside of the counsel's suite.(456)  Officer O'Neill then locked and alarmed the suite and joined the two women on the elevator.(457)  

<P>Ms. Lieberman, Ms. Williams and Mr. Nussbaum each denied removing any documents, or seeing anyone removing documents, from Mr. Foster's office on the night of his death.18 

<P>Mr. Nussbaum testified that after he left Mr. Foster's office together with both Ms. Thomasson and Ms. Williams, he proceeded to his office to make some telephone calls and then locked and alarmed the Counsel's suite when he left.  This testimony was contradicted by the White House alarm logs maintained by the Secret Service for July 20, 1993, which showed that Officer O'Neill alarmed the counsel's suite at 11:41 p.m.(458)19 

<P>Curiously, after Ms. Williams left the White House, she called Mrs. Clinton in Little Rock at 12:56 a.m. on the morning of July 21, and they spoke for 11 minutes.  Ms. Williams claimed that she did not tell Mrs. Clinton about her search of Mr. Foster's office.(459)  Although Ms. Williams testified that she did not recall talking to Susan Thomases on the evening of Mr. Foster's death,(460) telephone records obtained by the Special Committee indicated that, upon ending her conversation with Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Williams called Ms. Thomases at 1:10 a.m., and they spoke for 14 minutes.(461)  Of her conversation with Ms. Williams, Ms. Thomases testified: "I don't recollect speaking with her that night.  That's not to say that she didn't call me back and I didn't speak to her, but I have no independent recollection of having spoken with her that night."(462)  



<P>III.  July 21, 1993.

A.<P>Mr. Foster's Office Is Finally Sealed.

<P>When Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell woke up on July 21, 1993, he immediately called William Burton, Deputy Assistant to the President, and asked him to lock Mr. Foster's office.(463)  In the middle of the night, "one of the things that kept me awake is saying we ought to make sure Vince's office is locked."(464)  Mr. Hubbell wanted to make sure that the office was secured and that its contents were documented and handled in a "professional" manner.(465)  When Mr. Hubbell reached Mr. Burton at the White House, some time between 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m., Mr. Burton assured Mr. Hubbell that White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty had taken steps to seal the office on the previous night.(466)  Mr. Burton did not recall discussing sealing the office with Mr. Hubbell,(467) although his undated, handwritten notes listed "1) Secure office" near the notation "Webb" and Mr. Hubbell's home and office phone numbers.(468)

<P>Betsy Pond, Bernard Nussbaum's secretary, arrived at the White House early in the morning of July 21, at around 7:00 a.m.(469)  She then entered Mr. Foster's office, which had not been sealed.  She followed the routine procedure to disarm the alarm for the Counsel's suite.(470)  Once inside Mr. Foster's office, she looked at documents on the coffee table and the desk, turned the documents over, and "smushed them together in a pile."(471)

<P>Associate Counsel to the President Stephen Neuwirth testified that when he arrived at the White House Counsel's suite on July 21, he saw Ms. Pond in Mr. Foster's office.  Ms. Pond told him that she was straightening out the office, and Mr. Neuwirth told her that she should not be in Mr. Foster's office.(472)  Mr. Neuwirth testified that he "didn't think it was appropriate for an assistant to Mr. Nussbaum to be in the office at that time."(473)  Ms. Pond then left Mr. Foster's office and called Mr. Nussbaum at home.  According to Ms. Pond, she told Mr. Nussbaum that she had been in Mr. Foster's office, and Mr. Nussbaum told her not to let anyone in the office.(474)  Mr. Nussbaum confirmed this conversation.(475)

<P>Linda Tripp, Mr. Nussbaum's executive assistant, testified that Ms. Pond told her that she went into Mr. Foster's office to search for a note: 

<P>She said, "Well, I just went in there but just to straighten papers." And, I said, "Betsy, why would you have gone in there to straighten papers? We never go into Vince's office to straighten anything."  She then admitted that she was hysterical, and she was very, very overwrought, and that she had actually been in there looking for a note but that no one was to go in there; and, those were Bernie's strict instructions.(476)

<P>At 8:00 a.m., the White House senior staff, which included, among others, Messrs. Burton, Gergen, and Nussbaum, attended a daily meeting in Mr. McLarty's office.(477)  Although those present at the meeting were fairly certain that they discussed Mr. Foster's death,(478) none could recall the specifics of the discussion.  Nor could anyone remember a discussion of the investigation into their colleague's death,(479) other than "that the Park Police would be looking into it."(480)  And, no one recalled any discussion of sealing Mr. Foster's office and preserving its contents.(481)

<P>Instead, Mr. Nussbaum testified that, after the daily meeting of the White House Counsel's Office at 9:00 a.m., he talked with Mr. Neuwirth and Associate Counsel to the President Clifford Sloan about securing Mr. Foster's office.  Mr. Nussbaum realized that "there would be investigations obviously with respect to Vince's death.  And under those circumstances, it would be best to make sure that the office was secure in connection with those investigations."(482)  According to Mr. Nussbaum, Mr. Neuwirth and Mr. Sloan, the three lawyers concluded that Mr. Foster's office should be sealed,(483) and they proceeded to call the Secret Service.(484)

<P>While the lawyers deliberated, Linda Tripp had independently contacted the Secret Service to arrange for the office to be sealed.  "When I first came in the morning and saw that it was not secured and Betsy was reacting to her situation, I said, `Why is this not secure? Why is there no tape?  Why is there no guard?'  She said, `No one has done that yet?'"(485)  Ms. Tripp testified that her professional background led her to recognize the need to seal the office.  "I've worked on the covert side of the Department of Defense . . . .  And, instantly, to me, that made--it made little sense to do anything else but ensure that we were not violating--I mean, it was obvious a history-making situation that would come to if not this end then at least a very visible end.  It just didn't occur to me not to do that."(486)

<P>So when one of the lawyers emerged from the meeting in Mr. Nussbaum's office and said, "`Someone better arrange to have an agent posted,'" Ms. Tripp had already made such arrangements.(487)  Donald Flynn, a Secret Service supervisor, confirmed that Ms. Tripp had called the Presidential Protective Division to request that an officer be posted outside Mr. Foster's office.(488)  Mr. Flynn forwarded the request to the uniformed division of the Secret Service and, at about 10:10 a.m., took up position outside Mr. Foster's office until he was relieved by the uniformed officer.(489)

<P>Even after a uniformed officer was posted at the door, White House personnel still had access to Mr. Foster's office.  As Detective Markland testified, "I came to find out that it wasn't exactly sealed but posted, which meant that people had access to the office but their comings and goings would be recorded by a Secret Service agent."(490)  Because the White House Counsel's office did not specify that access should be limited, Secret Service Agent Flynn instructed the uniformed officers not to impede access but simply to record entries into the office.

<P>  There really was no understanding as to whether or not people could enter the office or not.  I mean, I'll offer this on my own and that was that I instructed the officer that came up there to relieve me that if anyone did enter the office, to jot down the time and the name of who it was and what the purpose was for them going in the office, and then to relay the information to me.(491)  



Thus, the log indicated that at 11:10 a.m., Mr. Nussbaum entered the office and removed a small black and white photograph.(492)  Although Thomas Castleton, an intern in the White House Counsel's office, testified that he entered Mr. Foster's office with Mr. Nussbaum, Castleton's entry was not recorded in the log book.(493)

B.<P>The White House Impedes Initial Park Police Efforts to Search Mr. Foster's Office.

<P>Based on their various requests the previous night, the Park Police assumed that Mr. Foster's office had been sealed.  Sergeant Braun was under the impression that the office had in fact been sealed.(494)  Similarly, Major Robert Hines had spoken with Mr. Burton on the night of July 20 and requested that he seal the office, following "a normal procedure that our investigators would ask the Secret Service to do."(495)  Thus, when Major Hines and Park Police Chief Robert Langston briefed White House officials on their investigation at a 10:00 a.m. meeting on July 21, both Major Hines and Chief Langston thought that Mr. Foster's office had already been sealed.(496)  In fact, Chief Langston testified that, during the 10:00 a.m. briefing, White House officials assured him that the office had been sealed the night before, even though it was not.(497)  "There was acknowledgement, somewhere in that meeting, that the office had been sealed and that investigators would be conducting interviews of the staff up there that morning."(498)

<P>The two Park Police investigators, Captain Hume and Detective Peter Markland, arrived at the White House just as Major Hines and Chief Langston finished briefing White House officials.  Detective Markland, who replaced Sergeant Cheryl Braun on the case, found out upon his arrival at the White House that a uniformed officer had not been posted at Mr. Foster's office until the morning following Mr. Foster's death, despite contrary assurances to the Park Police.  He had a brief discussion with Secret Service Inspector Dennis Martin and Mr. Nussbaum, and "even though they were different times and there was confusion as to what time somebody was posted and who ordered it posted, both of them agreed they had not been posted until that morning at some point."(499)  Given the importance of the office to his investigation, Detective Markland was upset at the news.  "I was under the impression that it was posted the night before, after Mr. Foster was identified.  So I was upset about that."(500)  Detective Markland and Captain Hume complained to Chief Langston about the White House's failure to secure the office.  "[T]hose were comments that were just made by Hume or Markland at the time that it had not been sealed or wasn't sealed properly, or people had been allowed access, or something like that; that they had great concerns at the time."(501)  Those concerns prompted Chief Langston to call Robert Bryant, the special agent in charge of the Washington field office for the FBI, to request an FBI agent to assist the Park Police investigators.(502)

<P>The Park Police investigators were not permitted to enter Mr. Foster's office to search for evidence on July 21.  According to Secret Service Agent Flynn, he understood that Captain Hume and Detective Markland "were coming over with the intent of going into Mr. Foster's office to look for a suicide note."(503)  Secret Service Inspector Martin was assigned to escort the investigators "wherever they needed to go."(504)  However, when Agent Flynn encountered the trio later in the day, Agent Martin appeared to be "baby-sitting" the Park Police investigators.(505)  "They were waiting with him for a time to determine when they could go in Mr. Foster's office."(506)  The investigators had not been allowed access to Mr. Foster's office to search for evidence because "[t]hey were waiting for approval from Mr. Nussbaum."(507)  They waited through the afternoon.(508)

C.<P>The White House Counsel and Deputy Attorney General Agree on a Search Protocol for the Documents in Mr. Foster's Office.

<P>Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell was among those who attended the Park Police briefing at the White House in the morning of July 21.  As they were walking out of the meeting, Mr. Hubbell told Mr. Nussbaum that "he ought to think about staying out of this."(509)  Mr. Hubbell testified that he advised Mr. Nussbaum to recuse himself from the investigation because "I knew that there had been issues regarding the travel office and whether there should be an independent counsel to represent the White House with regard to the travel office investigation."(510)  Mr. Nussbaum replied that he wanted to talk to Mr. Hubbell about that later.(511)  They never talked.(512)

<P>Some time that afternoon, Mr. Nussbaum spoke with other senior officials at the Justice Department.  Shortly after the Park Police briefing, Mr. Nussbaum decided to ask the Justice Department to coordinate the investigation into Mr. Foster's death.(513)  He then called either Attorney General Janet Reno or Deputy Attorney General Philip Heymann to make the request.  According to Mr. Nussbaum, the Justice Department replied that the FBI would assist with the investigation.  For a coordinating function, however, "they may get other people involved."(514)  Other than this quick response to Mr. Nussbaum's request for assistance, Mr. Nussbaum did not recall any conversation with anyone about documents in Mr. Foster's office until officials from the Justice Department arrived at the White House later in the afternoon.(515)

<P>Mr. Heymann had a more detailed and markedly different recollection of the conversation.  Mr. Heymann did not remember who initiated this conversation, but suspected that he telephoned Mr. Nussbaum after the White House contacted Attorney General Reno and she delegated the matter to Mr. Heymann.  He was immediately aware of the sensitive nature of the investigation, based on his experience in the Justice Department.(516)

<P>According to Mr. Heymann, important legal, political and ethical considerations must be balanced in an investigation into the death of a senior administration official:  

<P>Number one is I know there's going to be a serious problem with documents because there are serious issues of executive privilege and there are serious issues of law enforcement and they aren't easily reconciled.  Number two, I know that there are going to be political attacks and political allegations of cover-up and I know that there's going to be conspiracy theorists.  I've been through that regularly and I know that they're out there. . . .  That difficulty of reconciling the three, number one and number two, leads to the third, and that is I worry a lot about the Department of Justice retaining the appearance and the reality of absolutely unbiased law enforcement.(517)

Because of these competing considerations, Mr. Heymann believed that any review of documents had to be undertaken jointly by law enforcement officials and the White House.  "So we can't make the judgment completely ourselves as to what's relevant. On the other hand, I don't think it's wise or desirable for the White House counsel to decide on his own what is executive privilege and what isn't."(518)

<P>On the afternoon of July 21, Mr. Heymann and Mr. Nussbaum agreed on an appropriate procedure to review the documents in Mr. Foster's office.  "I agreed with Mr. Nussbaum on what I think, and continue to think, is an entirely sensible plan for reconciling these competing interests."(519)  Career Department of Justice officials would review the documents jointly with Mr. Nussbaum, but the officials would be allowed to see each document to determine its relevance to the ongoing investigation:

<P>I would send over career prosecutors of unimpeachable reputation and rectitude and they would, with him, look at every document in the office.  They would look at the heading of its and maybe the first couple of lines, in order to see whether it had any likely relevance or any possible relevance, to Vince Foster's death.(520)

Although "agreed" did not mean that he and Mr. Nussbaum entered into a binding contract, Mr. Heymann was certain that he and Mr. Nussbaum had reached a meeting of minds on July 21 on the appropriate review procedure.(521)  "I understood it to be that we both thought that this was the right way to handle what would otherwise be a very difficult and sensitive problem."(522)  He described this procedure to Captain Charles Hume of the Park Police that afternoon.  According to Captain Hume:  "My first impression was that the documents would be looked at by the Justice Department attorneys."(523)

<P>Mr. Heymann selected two respected career prosecutors to go to the White House to review the documents -- Roger Adams, Counsel to the Deputy Attorney General, and David Margolis, Associate Deputy Attorney General.  Mr. Adams, who had been the principal ethics official for the criminal division, was, in Mr. Heymann's words, "unbiasable."(524)  Mr. Margolis, who had been chief of the  Department's organized crime section, "sort of epitomizes the most highly respected career prosecutor at this time.  There's no more highly respected career prosecutor at this time."(525)

<P>That afternoon, Mr. Heymann sent Mr. Adams and Mr. Margolis to the White House to begin to carry out the document review procedure to which he and Mr. Nussbaum had just agreed.  "I know we agreed and I know that because I know I sent Adams and Margolis over and I even thought the process was going to start that afternoon."(526)  Mr. Margolis corroborated Mr. Heymann's recollection:

<P>To give it the full background, he had called me up from a meeting, and he said, "I want you to go over to the White House with Roger Adams."  He said, "Vince Foster is dead.  There's an investigation of it."  I had seen the headline of that in the newspaper that morning.  He said he had reached a tentative agreement with Mr. Nussbaum that Roger and I were to go through at least the first page or two of each document in order to determine whether they were relevant to our investigation. . . .  Phil told me that he believed he'd had an agreement in principle with Bernie Nussbaum to do it that way, so I should go finalize it and then begin the search process.(527)

D.<P>The White House Finalizes the Agreement on the Search Protocol.

<P>When Messrs. Adams and Margolis arrived at the White House in the late afternoon, at around 5:00 p.m., they went to the White House Counsel's suite.  There, they met with Mr. Nussbaum, other members of the White House Counsel's office, an attorney for the Foster family, and officials of the FBI, Park Police, and Secret Service.(528)  The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the procedures for the review of documents in Mr. Foster's office.

<P>Mr. Margolis testified that, at the meeting, he and Mr. Nussbaum finalized the agreement on how to conduct the search the following morning.  "When I got there, I discussed it with Mr. Nussbaum.  And I believed then and I believe today that we finalized that agreement and that we both agreed to it."(529)  Roger Adams confirmed that Mr. Nussbaum agreed that the Justice Department officials would review the documents for relevance and, if the documents were relevant, for possible claims of privilege.(530)  Mr. Adams was certain that an agreement had been reached.  "I am not sure how the conversation went, but the procedure that I have just outlined was what was clearly agreed upon at that meeting on Wednesday the 21st."(531)

<P>The recollection of the Justice Department officials was corroborated by a contemporaneous FBI report.20   After summarizing how the FBI became involved in the investigation on July 21, the report stated: 

<P>An initial meeting was held with the White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum at which time it was agreed that the Victim's office, which is located adjacent to Mr. Nussbaum's would continue to be sealed by the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) until 10:00 A.M. on 7/22/93, at which time Margolis and Adams would conduct a preliminary examination of documents within the office.(532)

<P>When, near the end of the meeting, Mr. Neuwirth stated that Mr. Nussbaum alone would review each document for relevance, Mr. Adams and Mr. Margolis immediately objected.  Mr. Nussbaum then intervened, correcting Mr. Neuwirth and stating that the Justice Department attorneys would review the documents.  According to Mr. Margolis: 

<P>When we finished, Mr. Neuwirth on his staff, as I recall, attempted to restate the agreement, and got it what I believe was exactly wrong, and said, "The way we're going to do it is that Bernie will go through the documents, and he'll give you what is both relevant and non-privileged to review."  I said that's exactly wrong.  We just agreed to the other procedure.  And it was my recollection then, and it's my recollection today, that Mr. Nussbaum agreed with me that Mr. Neuwirth was wrong, and that we had that other agreement.(533)

Mr. Adams recollected the same incident.(534)

<P>At Mr. Heymann's request, Roger Adams typed up notes summarizing the activities of the Justice Department in connection with the Foster investigation.  Those notes, prepared the following week, confirmed Mr. Margolis' recollection:

<P>At the Wednesday meeting there was agreement that the Justice Department attorneys would look at each document or at least each file to determine if it contained privileged material, in which case it would not be examined by the Park Police or FBI.  We would not read the documents or make notes, but merely examine them long enough to determine if they were covered by the attorney-client privilege or possibly executive privilege.  As an example of the clarity of this agreement, Mr. Neuwirth at one point, apparently trying to summarize it, said that "Bernie would look at each document and determine privilege.  If he determined no privilege, it could be shown to the law enforcement officers."  He was immediately corrected and Mr. Nussbaum agreed that the Justice Department representatives would see the documents to determine privilege.(535)

<P>The recollection of Mr. Nussbaum and his associates contradicts the testimony of the career Justice Department officials and, most importantly, the only contemporaneous document -- an FBI report -- recording what occurred at the meeting.

<P>Mr. Nussbaum conceded that the search of Mr. Foster's office was discussed,(536) but maintains that no agreement was reached as to the procedure for reviewing documents.  "In my -- to the best of my recollection, and I do have a recollection about this, there was no agreement.  I think my recollection is supported by Mr. Neuwirth of my office who was there, by Mr. Sloan of my office who was there."(537)  Mr. Nussbaum acknowledged, however, that a misunderstanding may have occurred:

<P>  If the Justice Department officials believe that we reached an agreement after our July 21 meeting, then a misunderstanding and a miscommunication occurred, and I may be responsible for that.  But I do not believe, nor, as you have heard, do my colleagues in the White House counsel's office believe, who were present at those meetings, that we reached any agreement on July 21 or that we in any way misused the Department of Justice.(538)  



Mr. Neuwirth and Mr. Sloan corroborated Mr. Nussbaum's testimony that the exact protocol for the search was not resolved at the end of the July 21 meeting.(539)

<P>When Mr. Adams and Mr. Margolis returned to the Justice Department after the meeting, Mr. Margolis reported to Mr. Heymann that Mr. Margolis had finalized Mr. Heymann's agreement with Mr. Nussbaum.  

<P>I told him along the lines that he had thought that he had reached a tentative agreement with Bernie Nussbaum; that Roger and I would review at least the first couple, first page or two of each document, to determine whether it might contain something along the lines of an extortion note or a suicide note.  So it was the agreement that he had reached.(540)  



Mr. Heymann confirmed this testimony:

<P>Mr. Heymann:  That is what they reported to me when Mr. Margolis and Mr. Adams returned that evening, the evening of Wednesday the 21st, to the Justice Department.

<P>Senator Shelby:  What do your notes reflect, I was paraphrasing them?

<P>Mr. Heymann:  It said they discussed the system that had been agreed upon, I just described to you.  BN, that stands for Mr. Nussbaum, agreed.  SN, that stands for Neuwirth, said no.  We shouldn't do it that way.  The Justice Department attorneys shouldn't have direct access to the files.  David Margolis, the Justice Department attorney, said it's a done deal and Mr, Nussbaum at that point said yes, we've agreed to that.(541)

<P>During the meeting, everyone agreed that, given the lateness of the hour, the search of Mr. Foster's office would not take place until the following day.(542)  It was then decided that the Secret Service would place a secure lock on Mr. Foster's office door, the keys to which would be kept by agent Flynn of the Secret Service.(543)  The lock was installed at approximately 8:00 p.m. on July 21.(544)



<P>   IV.  July 22, 1993

A.<P>The White House Counsel's Office Interferes with Park Police Interviews of White House Staff.

<P>The next morning, July 22, at about 9:00 a.m., Detective Markland and Captain Hume of the Park Police returned to the White House to interview White House staff.  Two Associate White House Counsels attended each of the interviews.  Deborah Gorham, Mr. Foster's secretary, testified that members of the White House staff attended a meeting on the afternoon of July 21 with Mr. Sloan, Mr. Neuwirth, and Mr. Nussbaum.  Mr. Neuwirth, according to an electronic mail message from Linda Tripp to Ms. Gorham, "briefed us on comportment and interrogation."(545)

<P>During this meeting on July 21, Ms. Gorham told Mr. Nussbaum that Mr. Foster had "placed shredded remnants of personal documents"(546) in his briefcase.  Ms. Gorham wrote to Ms. Tripp in an e-mail that "I told Bernie in front of everybody that shredded remnants were in the bag,"(547) an exchange that Ms. Tripp recalled.(548)

<P>Captain Hume and FBI special agent Dennis Condon interviewed Betsy Pond, Mr. Nussbaum's secretary, in Mr. Sloan's presence.  According to Captain Hume's report of the interview, Mr. Sloan took notes during the entire interview.  At one point, "Bernard Nussbaum burst into the room and demanded, "is everything all right?"(549)  After being reassured, Mr. Nussbaum left.  Captain Hume asked Ms. Ponds whether she had been coached:

<P>When I questioned her if she had been told how to respond to our questions, she stated that Clifford Sloan (who was present during our interview) and Steve Neuwirth, both associate counselors, had called them all together on Wednesday evening and told them they would be questioned by the police and for them to tell the truth.(550)

<P>While Captain Hume and Agent Condon interviewed Ms. Pond, Detective Markland and FBI agent Scott Salter interviewed Deborah Gorham in the presence of Mr. Neuwirth.(551)  Mr. Neuwirth interjected at the end of the interview and "took Ms. Gorham out of the room to speak to her."(552)  They returned a short time later, "and Ms. Gorham stated that there was one thing she thought may be important that she recalled."(553)  Ms. Gorham then told the investigators that in the previous week, Ms. Gorham had, at Mrs. Foster's request, asked the White House credit union to credit Mr. Foster's pay on a weekly, rather than biweekly, basis to avoid overdrawing the family account.

<P>A similar incident occurred later in the day, after the Park Police had completed their interview with Ms. Gorham:

<P>At approximately 1450 hours, immediately after the inventory of Mr. Foster's Office by White House Counsel (reference report under this case file number by Capt. Hume), Detective Markland and S/A Salter were asked to remain and were ushered into Mr. Nussbaum's office by Mr. Neuwirth.  Ms. Gorham was brought in and she stated that she had just remembered some conversations that she thought were important to our investigation.(554)

Ms. Gorham then told the investigators that Mr. Foster's son and wife had called within the last two weeks to ask about Mr. Foster's mood.(555)

<P>Detective Markland testified that he believed the attorneys from the White House counsel's office attended the interviews in order to "report back to Mr. Nussbaum what was being said in the interviews."(556)  Because the White House lawyers were present, "[t]he atmosphere of those interviews made it impossible to establish any kind of relationship with the people being interviewed."(557)  The lawyers created an "intimidating situation" and therefore the interviews were not very productive.(558)  According to Detective Markland:  "It was my belief that the staff members that we were interviewing had been briefed beforehand and would say no more than what they were told they should tell us."(559)  "Everyone I interviewed on this day up there I felt had been talked to by Mr. Nussbaum or his staff and knew exactly what they were going to say, nothing more, nothing less.  And that was it.  They all came off very rehearsed."(560)

B.<P>The First Lady, Margaret Williams, Susan Thomases and Bernard Nussbaum Conduct a Series of Early Morning Telephone Calls.

<P>At 7:44 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on July 22, Margaret Williams, the Chief of Staff to the First Lady, called Mrs. Clinton at her mother's house in Little Rock.(561)  They talked for seven minutes.  This call set off a chain reaction of further calls.

<P>At 6:57 a.m. Central Daylight Time, or 7:57 a.m. EDT,  Mrs. Clinton called the Mansion on O Street,(562) a small hotel where Susan Thomases usually stayed in Washington, D.C.(563)  The call lasted three minutes.(564)  Ms. Thomases, a New York lawyer, is a close personal friend of President and Mrs. Clinton.  She has known the President for 25 years and Mrs. Clinton for almost 20 years.(565)  She was an adviser to the Clinton 1992 presidential campaign on the Whitewater issue, and remained in a close circle of confidants to the Clintons after the election.(566)  Susan Thomases was the third person Mrs. Clinton called after she learned of Mr. Foster's death, and they talked for 20 minutes.(567)  

<P>After her conversation with Mrs. Clinton, at 8:01 a.m. EDT, Ms. Thomases paged Bernard Nussbaum at the White House, leaving her number at the Mansion on O Street.(568)  After Mr. Nussbaum answered the page, Ms. Thomases and Mr. Nussbaum both agree that they talked about the upcoming review of documents in Mr. Foster's office.(569) 

<P>Associate White House Counsel Stephen Neuwirth, who was formerly an associate at Mr. Nussbaum's law firm in New York City, testified that Mr. Nussbaum told him that Ms. Thomases and Mrs. Clinton were concerned about investigators having "unfettered access" to Mr. Foster's office.  "Again, while I don't remember his exact words, in a very brief discussion, my understanding was that Ms. Thomases and the First Lady may have been concerned about anyone having unfettered access to Mr. Foster's office."(570)  Mr. Neuwirth thought that the conversation occurred on July 22, before the scheduled document review with law enforcement officials.(571)

<P>Ms. Williams initially did not tell the Special Committee about her early morning phone call to the Rodham residence.(572)  After obtaining her residential telephone records documenting the call, the Special Committee voted unanimously to call Ms. Williams back for further testimony.  When presented with these records, Ms. Williams testified:  "If I was calling the residence, it is likely that I was trying to reach Mrs. Clinton.  If it was 6:44 in Arkansas, there's a possibility that she was not up.  I don't remember who I talked to, but I don't find it unusual that the Chief of Staff to the First Lady might want to call her early in the morning for a number of reasons."(573)

<P>Ms. Thomases testified that she did not give instructions to anyone about the search of Mr. Foster's office:

<P>While my memory is not perfect -- I just don't remember every person that I spoke to during those days.  But I do know that I never, I say never, received from anyone or gave to anyone any instructions about how the review of Vince Foster's office was to be conducted or how the files in Vince's office were to be handled.  I want to repeat that.  I never received from anyone or gave to anyone any instructions about how the review of Vince Foster's office was to be conducted or how the files in Vince's office were to be handled.(574)

She acknowledged paging Mr. Nussbaum on the morning of July 22, but maintained that "I was not looking for Bernie to talk about the review of documents in Vince Foster's office.  I was really trying to reach him to talk to about how he was feeling and how he was doing."(575)  

<P>Ms. Thomases did offer that she talked to Mr. Nussbaum about the review of documents in Mr. Foster's office, but only because Mr. Nussbaum initiated the subject:

<P>He obviously was very focused on the documents at that time, where I was not, and he proceeded to tell me not to worry, that he had a plan, that he was going to take care of him.  He was kind of, as I said in my deposition, he was sort of venting.  He seemed to have a very clear sense that he was on top of it; he was going to handle it; he was going to give Vince's documents to the Clinton's lawyers, and that he was going to protect all the Presidential papers.(576)

She told Mr. Nussbaum that his procedure "sounds good to me."(577)  Ms. Thomases testified that she did not express any view to Mr. Nussbaum that the police should not have unfettered access to Mr. Foster's office.(578)  Ms. Thomases maintained:  "I don't remember ever having a conversation with Hillary Clinton during the period after Vince Foster's death about the documents in Vince Foster's office."(579)

<P>After Ms. Thomases' initial testimony, the Special Committee obtained telephone records documenting that she talked with Mrs. Clinton for three minutes immediately prior to paging Mr. Nussbaum on July 22.  The Special Committee voted unanimously to call Ms. Thomases back for further testimony.  When presented with the new records, Ms. Thomases testified that "I know you think there is a relationship between those two calls."(580)  She maintained, however, that the two calls were not related.  She testified that her early-morning conversation with Mrs. Clinton was about "the possibility that I didn't feel well enough to go to Little Rock" for Mr. Foster's funeral.(581)  According to Ms. Thomases, she called Mr. Nussbaum because "I was worried about my friend Bernie, and I was just about to go into a very, very busy day in my work, and I wanted to make sure that I got to talk to Bernie that day since I had not been lucky enough to speak to him the day before."(582)

<P>Mr. Nussbaum had a markedly different recollection of his conversation with Ms. Thomases on July 22.  He testified that Ms. Thomases -- not he -- initiated the discussion about the procedures that he intended to employ in reviewing documents in Mr. Foster's office.  "The conversation on the 22nd was that she asked me what was going on with respect to -- what was going on with respect to the investigation or the examination -- the examination of Mr. Foster's office."(583)

<P>Beyond this, Mr. Nussbaum testified that Ms. Thomases "said people are concerned about whether I was using the correct procedure or whether the procedure was -- people were concerned or disagreeing, something like that, whether a correct procedure was being followed, whether I was using the correct procedure, whether it was proper to give people access to the office at all something like that."(584)  According to Mr. Nussbaum, Ms. Thomases never specified who the mysterious "people" were to whom she was referring,(585) nor did Mr. Nussbaum understand who they were.(586)

<P>Mr. Nussbaum claimed that he resisted the overtures of the First Lady's close advisor:

<P>But I said Susan -- she wasn't in the White House -- at least I didn't know she was in the White House -- I said I'm having discussions with various people.  As far as the White House is concerned, I will make a decision as to how this is going to be conducted.  It's going to be done the right way.  It will balance out the various interests.  It's going to be done the way I think it should be done.(587)

<P>And, Mr. Nussbaum further testified that Mrs. Clinton did not convey to him, directly or indirectly, her views on how to conduct the search of Mr. Foster's office.(588)  Mr. Nussbaum did not recall telling Mr. Neuwirth that Ms. Thomases and Mrs. Clinton were concerned about the police having unfettered access to Mr. Foster's office.(589)

<P>Apparently, Ms. Thomases did not give up easily.  In the late morning of July 22, senior White House officials, including Mr. Nussbaum and Mr. Neuwirth, met in the office of Chief of Staff Thomas McLarty to discuss the upcoming review of Mr. Foster's office.(590)  At about the time of this meeting, between 10:48 a.m. and 11:54 a.m., Ms. Thomases called Mr. McLarty's office three times and Ms. Williams' office three times.(591)

<P>When asked about the coincidence of these telephone calls, Ms. Thomases testified that she "never actually remember[ed] speaking with Mack McLarty at his number during this period."(592)  With respect to the repeated calls to the office of the Chief of Staff to the First Lady, Ms. Thomases testified that she probably was attempting not to reach Ms. Williams but rather to be transferred to someone else in the White House.(593)  Although she testified that July 22 was "a very, very busy day in my work,"(594) Ms. Thomases suggested that she also may have been put on hold during these lengthy calls, for as long as nine minutes.(595)

<P>Ms. Williams testified that she could not recall talking with Ms. Thomases and suggested that she was at home in the morning of July 22.(596)  This explanation was contradicted by Secret Service records indicating that Ms. Williams had entered the White House at 8:10 a.m. that morning.(597)

C.<P>The White House Breaks Its Agreement with the Justice Department:  "A Terrible Mistake."

<P>By the time senior Justice Department attorneys David Margolis and Roger Adams arrived at the White House at 10:00 a.m. on July 22, 1994, Mr. Nussbaum had a change of heart.  He "announced that he had decided to change the procedure for the search or inventory of the office.  He said that he alone would look at each document to determine relevance and privilege, and that we would not be doing that."(598)  

<P>According to Roger Adams, the Justice Department officials "pointed out that that was completely inconsistent with the agreement of the day before, and we argued with Mr. Nussbaum.  We said this was not what we had agreed to, that he was making a mistake, and we were going to have to call our boss, the Deputy Attorney General."(599)  According to Mr. Margolis, Mr. Nussbaum said that there had been a change of plans, "that he would look at the materials to determine whether they were relevant, make the first cut, and determine the privilege issues and the sensitivity issues.  And then anything that met all his standards along those lines, if we still wanted to see, he would show us."(600)

<P>Upset, Mr. Margolis immediately called Mr. Heymann from Mr. Nussbaum's office phone.(601)  "I called Mr. Heymann and explained this change to him.  And we discussed it.  We were both dead set against it."(602)  Both were surprised by Mr. Nussbaum's new plan, which they thought was wrong.  According to Mr. Margolis, "We were very concerned as to how this would appear to the public in terms of law enforcement, and in terms of whether we were running a credible investigation."(603)  Mr. Heymann testified that "Mr. Margolis told me that Mr. Nussbaum had said to me that they had changed the plan, that only the White House counsel's office would see the actual documents."(604)  Mr. Heymann then asked to speak to Mr. Nussbaum.

<P>When Mr. Nussbaum got on the telephone, Mr. Heymann warned him sternly that "this was a terrible mistake":(605)  

<P>I remember very clearly sitting in the Deputy Attorney General's conference room picking up the phone in that very big room.  I remember very clearly being very angry and very adamant and saying this is a bad -- this is a bad mistake, this is not the right way to do it, and I don't think I'm going to let Margolis and Adams stay there if you are going to do it that way because they would have no useful function.  It would simply look like they were performing a useful function, and I don't want that to happen.(606)

<P>According to Mr. Heymann, Mr. Nussbaum was surprised at Mr. Heymann's reaction and wanted to check with unspecified others before making a final decision.  "[H]e was taken aback by my anger and by the idea that I might pull out the Justice Department attorneys and he said I'll have to talk to somebody else about this or other people about this, and I'll get back to you, Phil."(607)

<P>Mr. Nussbaum feared that the Justice Department officials would not attend the document review.  He specifically told Mr. Heymann: "don't call Adams and Margolis back to the Justice Department.  I'll get back to you."(608)  Notwithstanding this explicit promise, Mr. Nussbaum never called Mr. Heymann back.(609)

<P>The nearly contemporaneous notes21  of Cynthia Monaco, Special Assistant to the Deputy Attorney General, confirmed Mr. Heymann's testimony:    

<P>The next day [July 22] was a disaster.  I first realized there was a problem when I saw Phil Heymann on the phone with Bernie Nussbaum.  I walked into the conference room and sat down.  This was probably about 10:30 or 11 in the morning when he should have been in the Crime Bill pre-meeting in room 4118.  Phil was on the phone with Bernie Nussbaum and he said: "you are messing this up very badly.  I think you are making a terrible mistake."  And what I took it to mean, in the context of the general conversation was that Bernie had refused to let David and Roger take a look at the documents.(610)

Mr. Nussbaum denied having this conversation with Mr. Heymann.(611)

<P>After Mr. Heymann and Mr. Nussbaum finished their conversation, Mr. Margolis returned to Mr. Nussbaum's office and spoke with Mr. Heymann.(612)  Mr. Margolis thought that even if Mr. Nussbaum did not change his mind, the Justice Department attorneys should remain at the White House because "we really had no choice.  Walking away was not really an option, because we had no sense of when the search would be conducted by Mr. Nussbaum, and what the parameters would be, and just what would happen, although we agreed we had to push with all our might to try to change it around.  And that's what we did."(613)  Mr. Margolis thought that Mr. Heymann agreed with this course of action.(614)

<P>Mr. Heymann, however, assumed from his conversation with Mr. Nussbaum that Mr. Nussbaum, after his consultations, would call Mr. Heymann back to let him decide what to do.  "And I also thought that I had an understanding that nothing would happen without my at least being informed and having an opportunity to react."(615)  Mr. Heymann believed that the search would not go forward until Mr. Nussbaum called him back.(616)

<P>After he got off the telephone with Mr. Heymann, Mr. Margolis tried again in vain to convince Mr. Nussbaum that the new procedures were "a big mistake."

<P>I explained to Mr. Nussbaum that to do it his way would be a big mistake.  I said, "It was your mistake if you do it this way, but it is a big mistake."  I think it was at that point when I also said to him, "You know, if this were IBM that we were talking about, I would have a subpoena duces tecum returnable forthwith with these documents.  But I recognize this is not IBM."  And he made a facetious comment about, if this were IBM rather than the White House counsel's office, a smart lawyer would have removed the documents before the subpoena ever got there.  That I took as a facetious comment.  Anyway, he wasn't talking about what he would do.(617)  

<P>Mr. Margolis stressed the importance of maintaining the public perception of a credible and thorough investigation.(618)  He believed that law enforcement officials must have a substantive role in the review process and not be "excess baggage," as they would be under Mr. Nussbaum's new plan; "I might as well go back to my office, and he could mail the results of the search back to me."(619)

<P>According to Mr. Margolis, Mr. Nussbaum conceded that having the investigators attend the review was mostly out of concern for "show and appearances."(620)  Fearing that the lawyers would leave, Mr. Nussbaum insisted that they wait in the White House lobby:

<P>He made it very apparent that he would be really appreciative if we didn't leave in the interim.  I think I have said something about, "Maybe in any event I'll go back to the office while you're thinking about it, and I can always get back here in 15 minutes if I decide to and I want to and if I have to."  But he very much requested that we just wait.(621)

<P>Mr. Adams and Mr. Margolis then waited in the lobby of the White House.(622)  At one point, the Justice Department attorneys went outside.  Believing that Mr. Adams and Mr. Margolis had left the White House, the White House lawyers went out to look for them. "Bernie had said he had thought, when he couldn't find us in the lobby, that we might have left and he was concerned about that."(623)  Mr. Nussbaum did not remember Mr. Margolis threatening to leave the White House.(624)

<P>The notes of Adams of the morning's events confirmed Mr. Margolis' recollection:

<P>The next morning [July 22], however, Mr. Nussbaum had changed his mind and said he would look at the documents and decide privilege issues himself.  The Justice Department attorneys pointed out that that was inconsistent with the previous day's agreement and would cause problems.  We stated that the Counsel's Office would be better off to allow the Department attorneys to decide or at least help decide privilege issues, because that would allow the White House to say that the issue was considered independently.  Moreover, we stated that we had been asked to undertake this particular assignment in part because we had reputations of not talking to the press or "leaking."  Mr. Nussbaum did not immediately begin the search but waited for about two and one half hours -- during which time he said he was considering whether to allow us to see the documents -- before deciding that only he and Associate Counsels Neuwirth and Sloan would see the documents.(625)

<P>Mr. Nussbaum admitted that he discussed with various people how to conduct the search on July 22.(626)  But he did not recall a specific discussion with Mr. Margolis in the morning during which Mr. Margolis and Mr. Adams objected to his proposed procedure.(627)  And, he did not recall Mr. Margolis or Mr. Heymann telling him that he was making a mistake.(628)  Although Mr. Nussbaum could not remember speaking with the Justice Department officials, he did acknowledge conversations with a number of senior White House officials who were concerned about the search.(629)

<P>In particular, John Quinn, then Chief of Staff and Counselor to the Vice President and now Counsel to the President, advised Mr. Nussbaum that only White House officials should be allowed access to Mr. Foster's office.(630)  "He thought it was a terrible mistake and stressed it very firmly."(631)  According to Mr. Quinn:

<P>I wanted to be sure that somebody with the appropriate level of security clearance and who was privy to the attorney-client relationship first went through the office in order to ascertain if national security materials or privileged communications were present and, if so, to take steps to segregate them.(632)

D.<P>The Window-Dressing Review of the Documents in Mr. Foster's Office.

<P>After lunch, at about 1:15 p.m., Mr. Nussbaum summoned the law enforcement officials to attend the review of the contents of Mr. Foster's office.(633)  Mr. Nussbaum then announced that he alone -- and no law enforcement official -- would review the documents in his now deceased deputy's office.  According to Mr. Margolis:

<P>So we ate, we came back in, and that's when Bernie told us he had given due consideration to our arguments, he thought they were good arguments, but he was sticking with doing it his way, which was he would review the documents, tell us generically what they were, if there wasn't a problem with them and if they had any sense of being germane, let us look at them.(634)

<P>Mr. Nussbaum testified that the career law enforcement officials initially resisted his plan, but then "went along."(635)  After Mr. Nussbaum indicated that law enforcement officials would not be allowed to review Mr. Foster's papers, Mr. Margolis said, "`It's a  mistake. . . .  But it's your mistake.  So, okay.'"(636)  Mr. Margolis also told Mr. Nussbaum, "You know, if this were IBM that we were talking about, I would have a subpoena duces tecum returnable forthwith for these documents.  But I recognize this is not IBM."(637)

<P>The group entered Mr. Foster's office to observe Mr. Nussbaum conduct the review.  Present were Mr. Nussbaum, Mr. Burton, Mr. Sloan, and Mr. Neuwirth from the White House; Captain Hume and Detective Markland from the Park Police; Agents Salter and Condon from the FBI; Messrs. Margolis and Adams from the Justice Department; Paul Imbordino and Paul Flynn from the Secret Service; and Michael Spafford, a private attorney who represented the Foster family.(638)

<P>During the document review, according to Mr. Adams, "Mr. Nussbaum was seated at Vince Foster's desk.  Standing behind him were Steve Neuwirth and Cliff Sloan.  Mr. Margolis and myself and the law enforcement officers were seated in what I describe as a rough semicircle around the desk in sort of rough rows.  Standing off to one side was the Foster family's attorney Mr. Spafford."(639)

<P>According to Captain Hume's report of the review:  "The eight law enforcement officers were gathered on the opposite side of the desk and room in a position where we couldn't examine any documents."(640)  Detective Markland confirmed that the law enforcement officers were specifically placed where they could not see the documents as Mr. Nussbaum was reviewing them.(641)

<P>Mr. Nussbaum then reviewed the documents in Mr. Foster's office.  He briefly described the documents and placed them into three categories.  Mr. Margolis and FBI agent Adams believed that one pile consisted of personal materials that were going to the Foster family; the second pile consisted of official White House documents that were to be distributed to other White House attorneys; and the third consisted of the Clintons' personal documents, which were to be sent to the Clintons' personal lawyer.(642)  The Park Police detectives described the three categories as follows:  (1) documents of potential interest to law enforcement; (2) documents concerning White House business with no relevance to the investigation;  and (3) personal papers of either the Clintons or the Foster family.(643)  Mr. Spafford, the Foster family attorney, wrote in a contemporaneous memorandum: "The documents were separated into three groups: personal matters, documents of potential interest to the investigators, and matters of no apparent interest."(644)

<P>Mr. Nussbaum provided a brief and generic description of the documents he reviewed.(645)  Captain Hume reported that "Bernard Nussbaum did the actual review of the documents in a very hurried and casual fashion."(646)  According to Mr. Adams:

<P>As best I can recall, with most of the documents he made just sort of a generic description, something like this is personal; this is going to the family of the -- this is something that Vince has been working on; it's relevant to work of the White House counsel's office; it's going to be distributed to other lawyers in the office. 

<P>

<P><P>Another thing he would say is this is something he had been working on for the President personally.  This is going to the President's outside attorney.  Now, there were occasions where some documents he would describe a little bit more -- a little bit more definitely than that, but it's my recollection that, in general, it was just a generic description of them.(647)

<P>Mr. Margolis recalled essentially the same rushed procedure:

<P>[Nussbaum] went through the items on and in and around Mr. Foster's desk and announced what they were, generically, like, "This file is a file of nominations that Vince was working on for the President.  It's not germane.  This is a matter that Vince was working on for the first family in their nonofficial capacity.  It's not germane."  Things like that.(648)

<P>At different times during the review, Mr. Margolis renewed his objections to Mr. Nussbaum's review.  In fact, Mr. Margolis specifically objected to the fact that Mr. Nussbaum's descriptions were so generic that they were of little assistance to the investigators.(649)  He remarked that "it gave me a bit of deja vu all over again of dealing with the CIA . . . ."(650)  FBI Agent Salter had a similar view:  "At one point, I recall that Mr. Nussbaum described documents as he went through, and declared that they were not pertinent to the investigation, and I know Mr. Margolis responded by saying how do we know if they're pertinent or not if we don't get to look at the documents."(651)  Mr. Adams recalled that, at some point, "Mr. Margolis again interposed an objection to the procedure.  He said, the best I can recall, that this was a mistake and that Mr. Nussbaum might as well conduct the review himself and mail us the results or mail Mr. Margolis the results."(652)

<P>Mr. Nussbaum took what the law enforcement officials thought were "extreme" positions to shield documents from their review.  According to the Park Police report:

<P>There was some conversation between Nussbaum and Margolis as to what constituted privileged communication.  Nussbaum carried his interpretation of what was considered privileged to the extreme; one example was when he picked up a xeroxed copy of a newspaper article and declared that it was privileged communication even though it had been in the newspapers.(653)

At no time during the approximately one-and-one-half hour period of the review did Mr. Nussbaum allow the law enforcement officials to examine any documents.(654)

<P>  The White House lawyers expressed concern -- to an unreasonable degree -- that the law enforcement officials might sneak a peak at Mr. Foster's documents.  According to the Park Police report: "At one point Special Agent Scott Salter got up to stretch and Clifford Sloan challenged him and asked him if he was standing up in an attempt to get a look at the documents."(655)  Agent Salter described the incident as follows:

<P>I was seated at the end of the sofa next to detective Pete Markland from the Park Police, and I think there was a third person seated at the opposite end from me.  And I think the review of documents had been going on for about 30 minutes with the three of us seated on the couch.  There wasn't a lot of room.  After about 30 minutes, I stood up and stood at the end of the couch, and in front of me was Mr. Margolis and then the desk. 



<P><P>After standing there for just a few minutes, Mr. Cliff Sloan looked at me and said, excuse me, agent, you aren't standing there so you can see the documents on Mr. Nussbaum's desk, are you?  And at that point I merely said that -- I told Mr. Sloan that I think he's getting carried away, and then Mr. Nussbaum interjected and said of course, we're all on the same side here, words to that effect.  And that was the end of the incident.(656)

Mr. Adams indicated that "the remark was (to put it charitably) extremely offensive."(657)  Mr. Margolis testified that he may have muttered an expletive after Mr. Sloan's remark.(658)  "I was bothered by that.  So, a minute later when Cliff was looking over Bernie's shoulder at some document that Bernie was looking at, I said, `Hey, Cliff, you're not looking over Bernie's shoulder so you can read the documents that he is looking at, are you?'"(659)  Mr. Sloan acknowledged the incident and apologized before the Special Committee, stating that his comment "was the wrong thing to say to a law enforcement official, or any person trying to do his or her job."(660)

<P>Toward the end of the review, Mr. Nussbaum announced that he would give Mr. Foster's personal papers and effects to Mr. Spafford, the Fosters' personal attorney.  Mr. Margolis objected, wanting to maintain the chain of custody within the government.(661)  The Park Police officers later told Mr. Margolis:  "we feel strongly that we would rather have the files go to Mr. Spafford and Mr. Hamilton because we would rather deal with them in the future than with White House counsel's office."(662)  Agent Salter confirmed Mr. Margolis' testimony:  "I think we all agreed it would be easier for the Park Police to have access to them if the family's attorney took them and they could be reviewed outside of the west wing of the White House."(663)

<P>During the review, the law enforcement officials requested that Mr. Nussbaum turn on the computer in Mr. Foster's office and examine its contents.(664)  According to Mr. Adams, Mr. Nussbaum refused because the computer might contain privileged information.(665)  Mr. Adams' memorandum about the review described the incident as follows:

<P>We asked to have the computer in Mr. Foster's office turned on.  Mr. Nussbaum said he did not know how to do so and, in any event, he would not do so in our presence in case there were privileged documents on the computer.  He said he would have a staff member examine the contents of the computer later after we left.  (Press reports in the morning newspapers of that day had stated, without attribution, that no suicide note had been found on his computer.)(666)

Mr. Spafford's handwritten notes of the meeting confirmed that Mr. Margolis asked Mr. Nussbaum to review the computer.(667)  Mr. Sloan's notes of the meeting listed the computer with an asterisk next to it.(668)

<P>Mr. Foster's burn bag was also in the office at the time of the search.  According to Agent Salter, Mr. Nussbaum looked in the burn bag and "said that there was nothing that was pertinent to the investigation."(669)  Mr. Spafford's notes listed the burn bag and indicated that it was picked up everyday.  Its contents were described as "h/w notes re GC [General Counsel] issues/all wk related".  Mr. Sloan's notes, however, contained a more detailed inventory of the contents of the burn bag:

<P>Burn bag



     -     ists<BR>

     -     background investigations [?]<BR>

     -     references to jobs<BR>

     -     arbitration of claims<BR>

     -     nothing personal<BR>

     -     campaign stuff(670)<BR>

<P>On July 27, after Mr. Neuwirth apparently discovered a handwritten note in Mr. Foster's briefcase, Linda Tripp sent the following electronic mail message to Deborah Gorham:

<P>it seems that whatever was uncovered by [Neuwirth], who summoned our boss, who then summoned BB, who then summoned H -- and whatever it was provoked a need for notetaking -- and had to do I presume with the burn bag -- I can't imagine that anyone as meticulous as this individual was, would have left anything he did not intend to be found.(671)

Ms. Tripp testified that "this individual" referred to Mr. Foster.(672)  Ms. Gorham replied to Ms. Tripp's message with the following: "What provoked COS [Neuwirth(673)] to call BWN [Nussbaum] was the briefcase.  Once BWN arrived, I forgot who went into VWF's office to get the Burn Bag.  But they must feel like a slapstick comedy by not returning the burn bag along with the briefcase."(674)  In another message on the same day, Ms. Gorham wrote to Ms. Tripp: "On Wednesday, I told Bernie that VWF had placed shredded remnants of personal documents in the bag.  On Thursday, I told Bernie in front of everybody that shredded remnants were in the bag."(675)  Ms. Tripp replied:  "I recalled the shredded talk, because when we spoke to [Neuwirth] and he briefed us on comportment and interrogation, you mentioned that -- that was on Wednesday evening, right?  So it took until MONDAY to figure out it should be looked at?  Christ.  And we're the support staff???????????"(676)

E.<P>Mr. Nussbaum's Failure to Search Properly Mr. Foster's Briefcase.

<P>Under any view, Mr. Nussbaum's effort to search Mr. Foster's briefcase was seriously deficient.  At the time of Mr. Nussbaum's review, the briefcase was located on the floor next to Mr. Foster's desk.(677)  Mr. Adams testified that Mr. Nussbaum "picked up the briefcase, announced that this was Vince's briefcase and he would proceed to inventory the items in the briefcase in the same manner as he had inventoried the items on the desk and credenza, and he proceeded to take files and documents from the briefcase and describe them as he described the other documents in the office."(678)  Agent Salter confirmed Mr. Adams' description.(679)

<P>Although notes taken by Mr. Spafford and Mr. Sloan indicated that the briefcase contained a copy of the White House Travel Office Management Review, Mr. Nussbaum did not disclose to investigators that most of the contents of the briefcase pertained to the Travelgate controversy.(680)  Among the contents was a notebook in Mr. Foster's hand relating to the entire Travel Office matter.   According to Mr. Spafford's notes, Mr. Nussbaum described the notebook as "Notebook of notes of meetings, GC [General Counsel] issues"; Mr. Sloan's notes similarly identified the notebook simply as "Notes re: meeting".(681)  After the review, Mr. Nussbaum removed Mr. Foster's notebook and other Travelgate files from the briefcase and kept it in his office until his resignation in March 1994.(682)  The notebook and documents in Mr. Foster's briefcase were not turned over to the Independent Counsel until April 5, 1995.(683)  

<P>The notebook and documents were never disclosed to Justice Department officials and FBI agents then investigating Travelgate and the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office.  In fact, the Justice Department official responsible for the investigation, Office of Professional Responsibility Counsel Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., found out about the existence of Mr. Foster's notebook through a press report in July 1995.  Mr. Shaheen, enraged at Mr. Nussbaum's concealment of the notebook, wrote a memo to Mr. Margolis on the subject.  It stated in part:

<P>We were stunned to learn of the existence of this document since it so obviously bears directly on the inquiry we were directed to undertake in lat July and August 1993, by then DAG Philip Heymann -- that is, to review the conduct of the FBI in connection with its contacts with the White House on the Travel Office matter and to determine what Vince Foster meant by the statement in his note that "the FBI lied in their report to the AG."



<P>In a July 13, 1993 letter, President Clinton informed then Congressman Jack Brooks that the Attorney General was in the process of reviewing matters relating to the Travel Office, "and you can be assured that [she] will have the Administration's full cooperation in investigating those matters which the Department wishes to review."  While these may have been Mr. Clintons' views, the White House personnel with whom we dealt apparently did not share his commitment to full cooperation with respect to our investigation.  The recent disclosure of the Foster notebook confirms this.(684)

Mr. Shaheen, after outlining specific instances of noncooperation by the White House, concluded, "The fact that we have just now learned of the existence of obviously relevant notes written by Mr. Foster on the subject of the FBI report is yet another example of the lack of cooperation and candor we received from the White House throughout our inquiry."(685)

<P>Mr. Nussbaum testified that he did not recall, during the course of his review on July 22, ever picking the briefcase up off the floor(686) or looking into the briefcase as he was pulling out the files.(687)  Agent Salter testified, however, that Mr. Nussbaum picked up the bag, opened it by the handles, tilted it, and looked inside.(688)  Mr. Adams,(689) Agent Condon,(690) Agent Flynn,(691) Captain Hume,(692) Detective Markland(693), and Mr. Spafford(694) all confirmed that Mr. Nussbaum picked up the bag.

<P>Detective Markland testified that Mr. Nussbaum told the law enforcement officials that the briefcase was empty:

<P>He would reach down, take papers out of the briefcase, put them on the desk, go through them, put them in the appropriate piles.  When he got done, he said that's it, it's empty.  After that he picked up the briefcase with both hands, spread it apart a little bit, tilted it, put it back down and shoved it to the back of the room. I could see the briefcase lifted off the floor by him and tilted, put it down, said it was empty two times and moved it back.(695)



Detective Markland was certain that Mr. Nussbaum had looked in the bottom of the briefcase.  "He had a clear view of the briefcase on the floor so that he had it spread open with both hands and was looking down into the briefcase."(696)

<P>Agent Salter similarly confirmed that Mr. Nussbaum "stated that it was empty and he turned and placed it behind him against the wall."  Mr. Margolis likewise testified that "he did take files out of it, a number of files out of it, and then he told us, I don't remember the exact language, but told us that that was it, that there was nothing more."(697)

<P>Mr. Nussbaum contended that he did not recall the process described by Detective Markland,(698) and his White House colleagues concurred in Mr. Nussbaum's testimony  that he did not state that the briefcase was empty.(699)  

<P>The general impression of those at the review was that the briefcase was empty when Mr. Nussbaum was finished.  Thus, when Mr. Burton found out that Mr. Neuwirth had discovered a note in the briefcase, he said, "Well, you've really got to explain this because I saw Bernie empty it.  How could it have been in that briefcase?"(700)  

<P>The law enforcement officials present at the review agreed with Mr. Burton's assessment.  After the note was discovered, Captain Hume was skeptical that Mr. Nussbaum would not have seen a note in the briefcase on July 22.  Major Hines agreed with Captain Hume that "our oldest, blindest detective would have found the note."(701)  Detective Markland likewise testified that it was impossible for Mr. Nussbaum to miss a torn up note in the briefcase because "he is looking for documents, he has a co-worker and friend who is dead.  One of the things he may be looking for could presumably be ripped up, he is not a stupid person.  And he physically picked up the briefcase at one point and tilted it and I saw it come off the floor and tilt, and then he put it down and said it is empty."(702)  Detective Markland was blunt in his testimony:

<P>Q:<P>Do you think he [Nussbaum] was lying?

<P>A:<P>Yes, I think it would have been impossible for him to miss that many torn scraps of yellow paper out of a briefcase that he was searching on the 22nd.(703)

F.<P>The Foster Family Lawyer Overhears Discussion of the Scraps of Paper in Mr. Foster's Briefcase.

<P>Michael Spafford testified that, at the end of the review, he remained in the room as the law enforcement officials were leaving.  He and Mr. Nussbaum discussed the details of the transfer of Mr. Foster's personal effects to the family.  Mr. Sloan then approached Mr. Nussbaum with the briefcase open in his hands:

<P>At some point in time I was talking to Mr. Nussbaum, and at some point in time Mr. Sloan had the briefcase in his hand.  So I didn't see him pick it up.  And he made the comment at that point in time that there appeared to be scraps in the bottom of the briefcase.



<P>* * *



<P>He was standing, and he had it by the handles.  And he had it open like this, and he was looking into the briefcase.(704)

<P>According to Mr. Spafford, Mr. Nussbaum's response was dismissive.  "Mr. Nussbaum was sitting on the couch or sofa at the time, and his comment was something to the effect that we will get to all that later; we have to look through the materials and we will look through that later."(705)  Mr. Spafford had put away his materials and was gathering up Mr. Foster's personal effects at this point, so he was no longer taking notes of the meeting.(706)  The following week, right after he found out that Mr. Neuwirth had discovered a note in the briefcase, Mr. Spafford recounted the incident in a privileged conversation.(707)

<P>Mr. Nussbaum and his associate Mr. Sloan both testified that they did not recall this incident.  According to Mr. Sloan, "I have no recollection of anything remotely like that incident, and I think that I would recall it if it had happened.  Mr. Spafford and I have an honest difference in recollection on this point."(708)

<P>Mr. Spafford's testimony casts a cloud of doubt on the White House's assertions that the note in Mr. Foster's hand was actually "discovered" on July 26.  As Mr. Margolis testified to the Special Committee:

<P>I thought I had this figured out, that the torn-up scraps of paper were not in the briefcase the day that Mr. Nussbaum did the search in our presence.  That's what -- that was the explanation I came up with, and that somebody -- that it had never been there before and somebody put it in afterward or it had been there, somebody took it out and then decided they better put it back because there was public speculation of, you know, where is the suicide note.



<P><P>So, in my own mind, I speculated that must be what happened.  But then, when I picked up the paper one day and saw that Mr. Spafford said that the note had been in there when the search was conducted, I am at a loss now.  I just have no explanation.  I don't know.(709)

The Justice Department and the FBI did not have the information Mr. Spafford provided to the Special Committee when the FBI closed its investigation into the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the note.

G.<P>The Secretive, Real Review of the Contents of Mr. Foster's Office.

<P>At the conclusion of Mr. Nussbaum's review of the contents of Mr. Foster's office, the office was again locked, and the key given to Mr. Nussbaum.(710)  Detective Markland thought that the office would remain sealed:  "It was my understanding that the office would be again posted and left undisturbed."(711)

<P>Although the law enforcement officials understood that Mr. Nussbaum would go through some of the documents again,(712) Mr. Nussbaum did not notify them that he intended to conduct a second search of the office, almost as soon as they left, with Margaret Williams, Chief of Staff to the First Lady.(713)   

<P>The circumstances surrounding this second search remained mysterious for some time.  The White House did not disclose that Ms. Williams was involved in the review and removal of documents from Foster's office.  At a press conference on April 22, 1994, Mrs. Clinton was asked whether Ms. Williams was among those who removed documents from Mr. Foster's office.  Mrs. Clinton replied, "I don't think that she did remove any documents."(714)  On August 2, 1994, Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers echoed Mrs. Clinton's statement: "I think that it is true that Maggie didn't remove any documents from Vince's office; they were removed by Bernie Nussbaum."(715)

<P>The evidence demonstrates that the foregoing White House statements were false. 

Mr. Spafford testified that Mr. Nussbaum told Mr. Sloan at the end of the meeting that they would look through the materials again later.(716)  Mr. Sloan's notes of the meeting ended with the following: "get Maggie--go through office--get HRC, WJC stuff,"(717) but he testified that "I did not have contemporaneous knowledge of anything beyond what's in my notes on this."(718)

<P>At 3:05 p.m. on July 22, William Burton called Ms. Williams and left a message for her to call back.(719)  Twenty minutes later, Stephen Neuwirth called Ms. Williams and left the same message.(720)  Ms. Williams testified that she had no independent recollection of these calls other than from the message slips produced to the Special Committee.(721)

<P>Mr. Nussbaum testified that "[s]hortly after the search of Vince's office was completed, I asked Maggie Williams the First Lady's chief of staff, to help me transfer these files to the Clintons and to their personal lawyers."(722)  When Ms. Williams got there, "Maggie and I started looking to try to select--making sure we took Clinton personal files rather than any other files."(723)  Mr. Nussbaum stated that he and Ms. Williams went through Mr. Foster's office together.  "This is Maggie walks in.  Let's do this, Maggie.  We start doing it.  I may walk out to take a call.  We complete doing it, but it was done relatively promptly."(724)  

<P>Margaret Williams, however, testified that she took no part in the review of the files, that "it seemed pretty much settled" when she entered Mr. Foster's office.(725)  Mr. Nussbaum had already selected which files were to be removed.(726)  "I can't recall if he had the files boxed that he pointed to or designated as the files that he wanted me to get to Barnett or whether or not they were just in a stack on the table.  But it seemed like whatever he was doing, it was done."(727)  She acknowledged, however, that Mr. Nussbaum asked her to "eyeball" the room and see if he had missed something.  In this cursory look, Ms. Williams saw a file marked "taxes," picked it up, and placed it among the materials to be removed from Mr. Foster's office.(728)

<P>During this second review, Mr. Nussbaum asked Mr. Foster's secretary, Deborah Gorham, to help locate certain files.  Curiously, he specifically asked Ms. Gorham about "the file drawer that contained the President's and First Lady's personal and financial documents."(729)  When Ms. Gorham entered, Ms. Williams was in the office with Mr. Nussbaum.(730)22   Ms. Gorham then opened a drawer in Mr. Foster's desk and started reading the names of the file folders.  Mr. Nussbaum interrupted her and said that he would take care of this ministerial task himself.(731)  She left the office and was called back a bit later.(732)  In her second time in the office, she sat down at Mr. Foster's desk and opened his middle desk drawer, where she found Mr. Foster's personal items, "such as checks that were written to Mr. Foster and his life insurance policy."(733)

<P>Mr. Nussbaum testified that he had no recollection of asking Ms. Gorham to point out the Clintons' personal files.(734)  Ms. Williams testified that Ms. Gorham was in and out of the office, but that Ms. Gorham did not assist in the review process.(735)

H.<P>The Transfer of Clinton Personal Files to the First Family's Residence.

<P>When Ms. Gorham went into Foster's office at Mr. Nussbaum's request, she saw boxes in the office.(736)  Mr. Nussbaum later asked her to have the boxes moved out of Foster's office, and she asked Thomas Castleton, Special Assistant to the White House Counsel, to carry them.(737)  According to Ms. Gorham, "Mr. Castleton picked them up and carried them out behind Ms. Williams.  The last that I saw of them, noticed them, was in the door just outside of our suite."(738)

<P>Linda Tripp, whose desk was in the same area as Ms. Gorham, testified that she saw Mr. Castleton carry the boxes out of the office.  She later learned from Ms. Gorham and Mr. Castleton that the boxes were delivered to the White House residence.(739)

<P>Margaret Williams testified that when Mr. Nussbaum called her earlier in the afternoon, he instructed her to deliver the files to the Clintons' personal lawyers. "[H]e asked me if I would be responsible for getting the personal documents of the President and Mrs. Clinton, which he was compiling, as I understood it, and get them to their personal lawyer, who was at the time Bob Barnett of Williams & Connolly."(740)

<P>Ms. Williams made three calls that afternoon that ultimately determined where the files were moved to.  "I called Mrs. Clinton -- well, I had three calls.  I called Bob Barnett's office.  I don't know if I spoke to Bob Barnett or if I spoke to the person who works with him in his office.  I called Mrs. Clinton, who was in Arkansas, and then I called Carolyn Huber, an assistant to the President who was working in the White House."(741)

<P>In the first call, to Williams & Connolly, Mr. Barnett told her that he would send someone over to pick up the files.  "When I had talked to Mr. Barnett after speaking to Mr. Nussbaum, I had indicated that I was going to send some files over as soon as they got together, and he said that he would send someone to get them."(742)

<P>Later in the day, however, Ms. Williams shifted course -- for, as she now claims, an innocent reason.  She was simply too tired to wait for the messenger to come from a law firm located near the White House:  

<P>And, quite frankly, I was tired.  And when I thought about the time it would take -- if anyone has tried to get into the White House complex, the time it would take, both to get a messenger, clear them in and actually have them get in and collect the box, I decided I could be at home in that time, and I decided at that point that the sending and the waiting for someone to pick up the documents would have to wait until later.(743)

She then asked Mr. Barnett not to send the messenger.(744)

<P>Claiming to be unsure where to put the Clintons' personal files, Ms. Williams made her second phone call, to Mrs. Clinton in Arkansas:

<P>I told her that there were personal files that weren't going to get to the lawyer because I was just tired, and I was going to put them in the White House, in the residence, and where did she want them. 



<P>* * *



<P>It was a very short conversation.  I know I had three points that I wanted to make.  I was tired, the files weren't going, I was going to put them in the residence, where did she want them -- four points.(745)

Ms. Williams claimed implausibly not to have previously spoken to Mrs. Clinton about the files.  She testified that she did not tell Mrs. Clinton where she was or the contents of the files.(746)  According to Ms. Williams, Mrs. Clinton did not ask any questions -- not even one, but instead merely told her to call Carolyn Huber.(747)  This may seem strange, as it clearly did to the Committee, "but let me suggest to you that I could have told Mrs. Clinton that I was going to put 44 elephants in the White House the day after Vince died and she probably would have said okay."(748)

<P>Ms. Williams then made her third and final telephone call, to Ms. Huber, in order to arrange the transfer of the files to the residence.(749)

<P>Thus, Ms. Williams testified that, because she was tired, she made the independent determination to transfer the files to the residence.  "I had determined that I was going to take the files to the residence if they weren't going to the personal lawyer.  I made that determination."(750)  She claimed to have received no instructions to move the files to the residence, and she called Mrs. Clinton only to ask where the files should be placed.(751)

<P>Mr. Nussbaum had a different -- and less convoluted and more plausible -- recollection on this key point.  He testified that he and Ms. Williams discussed moving the files to the White House residence.  "Obviously, I presumed they were going to the residence, and I think Maggie and I probably discussed that.  That's the most likely, send them to the residence, and talk to the Clintons and they will be sent from the residence on to their personal attorneys."(752)  According to Mr. Nussbaum, he told Ms. Williams to take the files to the residence:

<P>Simply take the files, give them to the Clintons, which means give them to the Clintons in their residence. . . . And when you get instructions from them as to which personal attorney, although it's probably going to be Williams & Connolly, we'll send it over to Williams & Connolly.(753)

Ms. Williams said okay.(754)

<P>Mr. Castleton had worked on the 1992 Clinton campaign and was serving as a special assistant in the White House Counsel's Office in July 1993.(755)  His best recollection is that he picked up "a box or possibly two boxes"(756) in either Margaret William's office or Mrs. Clinton's office.(757)  "I believe that the office in which I picked up the box had some dress, and my recollection is based on having seen her physically carrying them inside the office."(758)

<P>Mr. Castleton and Ms. Williams then took the elevator down to the passage way connecting the offices of the West Wing with the White House residence.(759)  They walked through the Palm Room into the residence.(760)  They "stopped off for a brief time to pick up a set of keys or a key and proceeded up to the living quarters area of the residence."(761)  When they got to the living quarters on the third floor, Mr. Castleton put the box or boxes "in a room off of a passageway" near the elevator.(762)

<P>Ms. Huber had long ties to the Clintons.  She served as office administrator for the Rose Law Firm for twelve years and administrator of the Governor's Mansion.  Since February 1993, she has been Special Assistant to the President for Correspondence, a position that also called for her to maintain records and files in the residence.(763)  She testified that, in the late afternoon on July 22, Ms. Williams "called and said that Mrs. Clinton had asked her to call me to take her to the residence to put this box in our third floor office.  We call it an office.  And we have a little closet in there where I keep their financial records, so she asked that I would take it up and put it there."(764)  Ms. Williams had not previously spoken to Ms. Huber about storing records in the residence.(765)

<P>Ms. Huber told Ms. Williams to call her when she was ready to come over to the residence:

<P>I would meet them at the elevator that goes up into the residence.  I met her and this young man -- I do not remember him -- Mr. Castleton.  We went to the third floor.  We went into the room where we have our office.  There's a little closet in there.  I got the key out of the desk drawer, unlocked the closet and he put the box in.(766) 

Ms. Huber then locked the door.  She put the key back into the drawer, went downstairs, and left for home.(767)  She did not see any dresses.(768)

<P>Although Ms. Huber testified that the boxes were transported between 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.,(769) records maintained by the Secret Service indicate that Ms. Huber, Ms. Williams, and Mr. Castleton went up to the third floor of the Residence at 7:25 p.m. and came down at 7:32 p.m.(770)

I.<P>The Reaction of Law Enforcement Officials to Mr. Nussbaum's Search.

<P>When Mr. Adams and Mr. Margolis returned to the Justice Department after Mr. Nussbaum's search of Mr. Foster's office, they were angry.  Phil Heymann remembered that "they were hurt and felt a little bit less than degraded, but almost degraded by the way it was done. And they were angry. And I remember their telling it to me in a way that they must have known was calculated to make me angry."(771)  Mr. Margolis and Mr. Adams complained to Mr. Heymann that the law enforcement officials were not permitted to look at the documents and that they did not have "any role at all to play with regard to decisions made about the documents."(772)  Cynthia Monaco's notes confirmed Mr. Heymann's recollection:

<P>I later heard from David that in fact what had happened was that Bernie looked at the documents and told him that a privilege was asserted or not asserted.  This was in contrast to what Phil and Bernie had decided the day before.(773)

<P>Mr. Heymann recalled a specific complaint that Mr. Nussbaum had asserted executive privilege "in a fairly casual way."(774)   Because Mr. Nussbaum alone saw the documents, "nobody knows what documents it is that Executive privilege is being asserted as to."(775)  Mr. Margolis testified that Mr. Nussbaum would not show him a clipping of a newspaper article on the grounds that it would be "an invasion of the President's deliberative process."(776)

<P>In any event, Mr. Heymann questioned the validity of Mr. Nussbaum's assertion of executive privilege against the Justice Department, the executive agency supervising the Office of the Legal Counsel, which had a primary function in protecting executive privilege.  "[T]he people who were going to have access to the documents would be officials of the Department of Justice. . . .  It wasn't like this was an outside body to whom there might be more reason to assert Executive privilege."(777)23   

<P>The Justice Department officials thought that they had been used by the White House to dress up Mr. Nussbaum's search of the office,(778) and they wanted to minimize the perception that law enforcement had actually participated in the search.  According to Mr. Margolis:  "Phil was troubled by that, and I think that's part of what he was talking about, that the impression was created that the Department of Justice did play a far larger role in the search than in fact it did."(779)

<P>After the search, the press reported that Mr. Foster's office had been searched under the "supervision" of the Justice Department.  This report prompted the Justice Department to issue a correction.  According to Mr. Margolis:  "I worried about something like that, and I remember with Mr. Heymann's permission, telling our press office to correct that, that the search was conducted in the presence of the Justice Department."(780)  Mr. Heymann testified that "I directed that the Department of Justice put out a correction that we had not supervised, that we had simply been there as observers while the investigation was carried out -- while the search was carried out by the White House counsel."(781) 

<P>After talking to Mr. Margolis and Mr. Adams on the evening of July 22 about Mr. Nussbaum's search, Mr. Heymann became very angry.  He said to Mr. Margolis, "`You know, Bernie was supposed to call me back and he didn't, and I am going to talk to him.'"(782)  Mr. Heymann then went home and called Mr. Nussbaum.  "I told him that I couldn't imagine why he would have treated me that way.  How could he have told me that he was going to call back before he made any decision on how the search would be done and then not call back?"(783)  Mr. Heymann said to Mr. Nussbaum, "You misused us."(784)  "I meant that he had used Justice Department attorneys in a way that suggested that the Justice Department was playing a significant role in reviewing documents when they had come back and told me they felt like they were not playing any useful role there."(785)

<P>Exasperated with Mr. Nussbaum's handling of the search, Mr. Heymann asked him:  "`Bernie, are you hiding something?'"(786)  According to Mr. Heymann, Mr. Nussbaum assured him that "no, Phil, I promise you we're not hiding something."(787)

<P>Incredibly, Mr. Nussbaum denies recalling this heated conversation with Mr. Heymann.(788)



<P>V.  July 26, 1995.

A.<P>The Existence of the Torn-Up Note Is Finally Revealed to Law Enforcement.

<P>The President, Mrs. Clinton, and most of the senior White House staff traveled to Arkansas for Mr. Foster's funeral on Friday, July 23, 1993.  On Monday, July 26, 1993, Mr. Nussbaum asked Mr. Neuwirth to prepare an inventory of the remaining contents of Mr. Foster's office.

<P>In the course of preparing the inventory, according to Mr. Neuwirth, he made an unexpected discovery in Mr. Foster's briefcase:

<P>On Monday the 26th at Mr. Nussbaum's request I was preparing an inventory of the contents of Mr. Foster's office.  One of the things that I did in connection with that inventory was to put into a box towards the latter part of my inventory process items that belonged to Mr. Foster personally, like photographs.  And in the process of putting materials in that box I saw the brief bag leaning against the back wall of Mr. Foster's office.  I understood it to be empty.  I knew that it belonged to Mr. Foster.  I picked it up and brought it to put into the box.  I had laid two large -- one or two or maybe even three large black and white photographs of Mr. Foster and his daughter with the President on the top of the box, and in an effort to avoid damaging those photographs, I turned the briefcase to fit it or the brief bag to fit it into the box, and in the process of turning it, scraps of paper fell out of the brief bag.(789)

<P>Mr. Neuwirth testified that, after he saw the pieces of paper falling out of the briefcase, he picked them up.  At that point, he recognized that "there was handwriting on them that looked like Mr. Foster's handwriting, with which I was familiar."(790)  He then looked in the bag for more pieces of paper.  Mr. Neuwirth then went to Mr. Nussbaum's office, which was adjacent to Mr. Foster's, and attempted to reassemble the torn up note on Mr. Nussbaum's conference table.(791)

<P>Mr. Neuwirth testified that, after he assembled the note, he went out to the secretarial area of the White House Counsel's suite and asked for Mr. Nussbaum.(792)  

<P>Mr. Nussbaum testified that he came back to his office at about 3:00 p.m. and found Mr. Neuwirth sitting at the conference table putting scraps of paper together.(793)  Mr. Nussbaum said, "What are you doing?"  Mr. Neuwirth replied, "I just found these.  I was packing Vince's briefcase to send back along with his other personal effects and I turn over the briefcase and these things floated out.  And I looked down and saw handwriting on them so I picked them up to see if I could put them together, and I'm putting them together."(794)  When Mr. Neuwirth was done, he told Mr. Nussbaum to look at the assembled note.  "[W]e saw that it was in Vince's handwriting, and it was a list of things, reflecting things that were troubling Vince."(795)

<P>Mr. Neuwirth discovered 27 pieces of a single sheet of yellow lined paper, 3-hole punched, which had been torn into 28 pieces.(796)  One piece was missing from the bottom third of the page, which appeared to be blank.  On the top approximate two-third of the page were written the following:

<P><P>I made mistakes from ignorance, inexperience 

<P>and overwork

<P><P>I did not knowingly violate any law or standard 

<P>of conduct

<P><P>No one in the White House, to my knowledge,

<P>violated any law or standard of conduct, including 

<P>any action in the travel office.  There was no intent 

<P>to benefit any individual or any group.

<P><P>The FBI lied in their report to the AG

<P><P>The press is covering up the illegal benefits 

<P>they received from the travel staff

<P><P>The GOP has lied and misrepresented its 

<P>knowledge and role and covered up a prior investigation

<P><P>The Ushers Office plotted to have excessive 

<P>costs incurred, taking advantage of Kaki and HRC

<P><P>The public will never believe the innocence 

<P>of the Clintons and their loyal staff

<P><P>The WSJ editors lie without consequence

<P><P>I was not meant for the job or the spotlight 

<P>of public life in Washington.  Here ruining people 

<P>is considered sport.(797)

Although the note was not signed, the FBI determined that it was written in Mr. Foster's hand.(798)24 

<P>Mr. Nussbaum then went to White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty's office to tell him about the note, but realized that Mr. McLarty was not there; he was in Chicago with the President.  "So I saw Burton, who was a logical person to talk to in any event because he was the one who had been dealing with me, and I said look, Steve Neuwirth found something, and you should see it and let's go up and see it.  And we walked up, and he went over to read it."(799)  According to Mr. B:  "Mr. Nussbaum came into the chief of staff's reception area asking for Mr. McLarty.  We informed him that he was out of town.  Mr. Nussbaum asked me to accompany him to his office, and I did that."(800)  Mr. Burton went to Mr. Nussbaum's office and read the note in front of Mr. Nussbaum and Mr. Neuwirth.(801)

<P>Deborah Gorham and Linda Tripp were at their desks in the secretarial area of the White House Counsel's suite, right outside Mr. Nussbaum's office, on the afternoon of July 26.  Ms. Gorham testified that Mr. Neuwirth came out of Mr. Foster's office with Mr. Foster's briefcase and went into Mr. Nussbaum's office.  After Mr. Nussbaum returned with Mr. Burton, according to Ms. Gorham, others came into Mr. Nussbaum's office.  "And then I believe Mr. Burton, Bill Burton might have appeared next going into Mr. Nussbaum's office, and then other people, I think, came in straggling, but I don't recall who they were."(802)

<P>Ms. Tripp recalled that she later saw Clifford Sloan in Mr. Nussbaum's office.  "It was later in the evening; I was in the reception area.  The door to Bernie's office was closed.  At one point in time Cliff Sloan came out of Bernie's office and asked me if it was possible to remove one of the typewriters to bring back into Bernie's office."(803)  Ms. Tripp asked him why he wanted a typewriter when there were five computers in the suite, and Mr. Sloan replied that he needed a typewriter.(804)  There were two typewriters in the office, but Ms. Tripp explained to Mr. Sloan that "the way they were configured and plugged in under all the massive furniture with the taping to the carpet and the commingling of all the myriad cable underneath, that it would be a very difficult endeavor, and then I offered to get him a typewriter -- excuse me, from elsewhere."(805)  Mr. Sloan then said that he didn't want her to do that, and walked back into Mr. Nussbaum's office.  Mr. Nussbaum did not recall wanting a typewriter in his office, although he remembered wanting to transcribe the note.(806)  Mr. Sloan testified that he was sure that Ms. Tripp was mistaken, since he did not know of the note until the next day, July 27.(807)  

<P>The next morning, on July 27, Ms. Gorham and Ms. Tripp exchanged a series of electronic mail messages about the peculiar circumstances surrounding the discovery of the note.  Ms. Gorham wrote to Ms. Tripp: "Everything from his briefcase is missing. . . .  I do not know what else was in there but the bag is totally cleaned out except for one collar stay."(808)  In another message to Ms. Tripp, Ms. Gorham wrote:  "On Wednesday, I told Bernie that VWF had placed shredded remnants of personal documents in the bag.  On Thursday, I told Bernie in front of everybody that shredded remnants were in the bag."(809)  Ms. Tripp replied that she remembered Ms. Gorham telling Mr. Nussbaum about the shredded pieces at the meeting on Wednesday, July 21, when the White House Counsel's office briefed the staff about the Park Police interviews.  Ms. Tripp's message ended on a note of exasperation:  "So it took until MONDAY to figure out it should be looked at?  Christ.  And we're the support staff???????????"(810)

<P>Ms. Gorham testified that, some time in the evening of July 26 or the morning of July 27, Mr. Nussbaum grilled her about what she had seen in Mr. Foster's briefcase in the previous week:

<P>Ms. Gorham: Mr. Nussbaum asked me to sit at the chair on the opposite side of his table and asked me if I had seen anything in the bottom of Vince's briefcase.  And I told him that I had only seen the color yellow, and I had seen the top of the Goldcraft third cut folder, and that was all I had seen.

<P>Mr. Chertoff: When you say a Goldcraft third cut folder, you mean a folder like this, a manila-type folder?

<P>Ms. Gorham: Yes, sir.

<P>Mr. Chertoff: And you told Mr. Nussbaum you had seen that in Mr. Foster's briefcase at an earlier time?

<P>Ms. Gorham: I told him I had seen the top of that cut of the folder.

<P>Mr. Chertoff: And what did Mr. Nussbaum say to you?

<P>Ms. Gorham: He asked me repeatedly what I had seen.  He asked me if the yellow could have been paper.  Could it have been lined paper?  Could it have been -- what it could have been?  And I told him repeatedly, numerous times, that all that I had seen out of the corner of my eye was the color yellow and the top of a Goldcraft third cut folder such as you have.

<P>Mr. Chertoff:  Was there anybody else in the room during this discussion with Mr. Nussbaum?

<P>Ms. Gorham: Not that I recall.

<P>Mr. Chertoff: Have you previously described this as an interrogation?

<P>Ms. Gorham: That is exactly how I have described and that is how--that is what took place.

<P>Mr. Chertoff: And would you agree that he was adamant and very forceful in putting his questions to you?

<P>Ms. Gorham: Indeed I would.

<P>Mr. Chertoff: I take it this experience is still very vivid in your mind?

<P>Ms. Gorham: Absolutely.(811)

<P>Mr. Nussbaum testified that he had "some kind of a recollection" of questioning Ms. Gorham, but he denies grilling or interrogating her.(812)  He did not recall the specifics of his conversation with Ms. Gorham.  He did not recall her mentioning that she saw file folders or yellow paper in the briefcase.(813)

B.<P>The White House's Decision Not to Disclose the Note Immediately to Law Enforcement.

<P>At one point in the afternoon, Mr. Nussbaum talked with Mr. Sloan and Mr. Neuwirth about what to do with the note.  They agreed that the note was not a suicide note, but Mr. Nussbaum knew it was the type of document in which the law enforcement officials would have a strong interest.  "So it was not clearly a suicide note and therefore, the issue was raised, is this the kind of thing that we were searching for that day.  That was -- to me it was clear it was the kind of thing."(814)  Mr. Burton suggested that the note was possibly shielded from disclosure by the attorney-client privilege, or other privacy interests.

<P>According to Mr. Nussbaum, Mr. Burton argued that they should research these issues before deciding whether to turn the note over to the authorities.(815)  Mr. Burton testified that, although he did not initiate the discussion, he recalled that "an issue of privilege came up with respect to the note in that it was my understanding that counsel's office was going to look to see if there was anything in the note that gave rise to privilege."(816)  Although Mr. Nussbaum testified that Mr. Burton wanted to know whether there would be "an obstruction of justice issue" if they did not disclose the note to the authorities,(817) Mr. Burton testified that "[i]t was never considered seriously or trivially or any other way that the note would not be turned over.  From the time the note was found, certainly from the time I knew of the existence of the note, that was never in doubt."(818)

<P>Mr. Nussbaum testified that, out of concern for the privacy of Mrs. Foster and respect for the President, he decided to wait until the next day, July 27, before advising the police of the existence of the note.  "I don't want Lisa Foster to hear about this on the radio or on TV:"(819)

<P>Now, I know I can call her up and read it to her on the phone, but I wanted her to see this thing.  I wanted her to be able to digest it.  And she's in Arkansas.  I called Jim Hamilton.  I had a concern about Lisa Foster.  That was really my primary concern.  I had a concern about Lisa Foster, so I called Hamilton, and I discovered -- I believe I called Hamilton.  I discovered shortly thereafter that Lisa was going to be in the next day.  She was coming in to Washington the next day in connection with -- she's returning to Washington after the funeral.  She's going to be in the next day on the 22nd.  The President was out of town.  He was to come in late that night.  He would be available the next day. 



<P><P>I thought it was common decency, before I turn this over to law enforcement, to let Lisa see it and digest it and let the President see it and digest it, and I didn't see any harm in letting them have that.  In the meantime, we could do the research that Burton was talking about, although I didn't expect that research was going to produce anything that would change my decision.  So I made the decision to show the note the next day to Lisa and to show it to the President if he wanted to see it when he came in the next day.(820) 

<P>Mr. Nussbaum and Mr. Burton then called Mack McLarty, who was in Chicago with the President.  Mr. McLarty told David Gergen, who recommended that Mr. McLarty tell the President and then promptly turn the note over to the authorities.(821)  Mr. McLarty decided, however, to wait until the next day, when the President returned to Washington, D.C., to take any action, including informing the President of the existence of the note.(822)

<P>Mr. Nussbaum assumed, on July 26, that Mr. McLarty would tell President Clinton about the note.(823)  Senator Grams questioned Mr. McLarty's decision to wait, even though Mr. Foster was a personal friend of the President and the "apparent suicide of the White House deputy counsel was big news at the time."(824)  Mr. McLarty replied: 

<P>When the note or scraps of paper were reported to me by telephone, I was perplexed when I heard of it.  We had just put, had the funeral for Vince and were moving forward, and I was perplexed by it.  I was in a hotel room in Chicago.  I didn't understand it.  It did not refer to suicide.  Did not have a salutation or a signature.  At that point there were issues - there were legal issues that were raised with me that I took seriously, that were raised in a serious way, that Mr. Nussbaum and others wanted to reflect on.  There was the issue of notifying the family.  And because I was perplexed by the note, I did want to see it, and I simply felt that it was not the correct course at that time to tell the President of a situation that was really not complete, that had not been reviewed and we had no plan of action.(825) 

Mr. Gergen took a commercial flight back from Chicago on July 26.  The President and Mr. McLarty flew back to Washington together, but Mr. McLarty claims that he did not tell the President about the note during the entire flight.(826)  Mr. Nussbaum did not wait at the White House on July 26 for the President's return.(827) 

C.<P>Mrs. Clinton and Susan Thomases Are Told of the "Discovery" of the Note.

<P>In the afternoon of July 26, while Mr. Burton was still in Mr. Nussbaum's office, Mr. Nussbaum left to get Mrs. Clinton.  Mr. Nussbaum recalled Mrs. Clinton's having an emotional reaction when she saw the note.  "She walked over and glanced -- looked at it.  I may have told her -- this is the thing.  I may have told her look, we found something Vince wrote. I'm not positive of it.  I don't have a specific memory of it, but it's something Vince wrote.  It's something you should read.  So my best memory is she sort of knew what she was going to look at, and she just -- [S]he looked at it, and all of a sudden she had some sort of an emotional -- she began to read it but she didn't read it.  She didn't appear to read it.  When she sat down and looked at it, she just said -- she had an emotional reaction and she said I just can't deal with this.  This is like -- I just can't deal with this.  Bernie, you deal with this.  And she walked out of my office."(828)

<P>In Mr. Burton's view, however, Mrs. Clinton had a different reaction to the note.  According to Mr. Burton, as Mr. Nussbaum was reading her the note, "she interrupted him and questioned her having been brought into the room and left the room."(829)  "She explained that she did not understand why she had been brought into the room, that the decisions to be made concerning the privilege issues, notifying the Foster family were other people's decision to make and she left the room."(830)

<P>Mr. Nussbaum testified that Mrs. Clinton did not discuss with him at all the handling of the note.(831)

<P>Susan Thomases testified that, at some point on July 26 and before even the President, the Foster family, the Park Police, or the Department of Justice were notified,(832) Mr. Nussbaum called and told her about the note.  "The substance is that a writing had been found and that he was going to wait until the President got back to show it to the President."(833)  Mr. Nussbaum denied contacting Ms. Thomases on July 26 about the note.(834)

<P>The Park Police and the FBI later interviewed, among others, Mr. Burton, Mr. Gergen, Mr. McLarty, Mr. Neuwirth, Mr. Nussbaum, and Mr. Sloan about the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the note.  None of the reports of these interviews mentioned the fact that Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Thomases were among those who saw or knew of the note before it was disclosed to the law enforcement officials.(835)

<P>Mr. Neuwirth testified that, although he was not asked about it, he told the FBI during his interviews that the Mrs. Clinton had been made aware of the note:

<P>I remember being asked questions.  I remember being conscious of the fact that when they asked me questions about what happened on that night, I had not been asked questions that would have covered the period when the First Lady was present, but I went out of my way at the conclusion of the interview to tell them -- when they asked me who else I knew had been told about the note, I went out of my way to point out that the First Lady was one of the people that I knew had been made aware of the note prior to the time that I understood it had been given to law enforcement officials.  And I'm very conscious of the fact that I made that effort precisely because I didn't think I had been asked a question earlier in which there would have been an opportunity to talk about the fact that the First Lady had come to look at it that night.(836)

<P>However, the FBI report of Mr. Neuwirth's interview, which summarized his account of the time between the discovery of the note and its disclosure to law enforcement, did not mention that Mrs. Clinton had been told of the note -- an important fact that a trained agent would almost certainly include in such a report.(837)  The handwritten notes of that interview, taken by Agent Salter, recorded a lengthy narrative by Mr. Neuwirth of the events on July 26 and July 27.  But nowhere in the narrative, according to the notes, did Mr. Neuwirth refer to either Mrs. Clinton or Ms. Thomases.(838)

<P>Mrs. Clinton's schedule for July 27, the day after the discovery of the note, indicated that Mrs. Clinton had a private meeting in her office with Mr. Nussbaum and Mr. Neuwirth from 2:30 p.m. to 3:00 p.m.--several hours before the note was turned over to the authorities.(839)  The schedule, however, did not specify the topic of the meeting.

<P>Mr. Burton testified that he does not recall any discussions in the White House about whether the law enforcement authorities should be told that Mrs. Clinton had seen the note.(840)  Curiously, Mr. Burton's notes of a staff meeting on July 28, the day after the note was disclosed to the authorities, listed "HRC" with a telling arrow pointing to an adjacent letter "n".(841)  Mr. Burton testified that he did not know what his own notes -- particularly the reference to the letter "n" -- meant.(842)



<P>VI.  July 27, 1993

A.<P>The Review and Transfer of Clinton Personal Files From the White House Residence to Williams & Connolly.

<P>On the afternoon of July 22, and after Mr. Nussbaum's real search, Thomas Castleton, an assistant in the White House Counsel's office, helped Margaret Williams remove boxes from Mr. Foster's office to the White House Residence.  As they were walking, Ms. Williams told Mr. Castleton that the boxes had to be taken to the residence for an important purpose:  the President or Mrs. Clinton needed to review their contents.(843)  According to Mr. Castleton:  "What [Ms. Williams] said was that the boxes contained personal and financial records pertaining to the First Family and that we were moving the boxes to the residence for them to be reviewed."(844)  Ms. Williams said that the files needed to be reviewed because "they did not know what was in these files and needed to determine whether there was something of a personal nature or not."(845)  "She said that the President or the First Lady had to review the contents of the boxes to determine what was in them."(846)

<P>Ms. Williams did not recall any such conversation with Mr. Castleton.  Ms. Williams testified that such a conversation would be out of character for her because "it is highly unlikely I would have this kind of discussion with an intern:"(847)

<P>Well, I would like to say affirmatively I did not say it because I can't imagine why I would have that discussion with an intern about the files going to the President and the First Lady.  I know that I told him we were going to the residence because I figured he needed to know where he was going, but I can't imagine that I said more than that.  So I do not recall having that discussion with him.(848)

<P>Mr. Castleton took exception with Ms. Williams' characterization of his role at the White House:  he was not an intern, but a special assistant to the White House Counsel.(849)

<P>Ms. Williams claimed that no one reviewed the Clintons' personal files while they were stored in the residence.  According to Ms. Williams, Carolyn Huber gave Ms. Williams the key after Ms. Huber locked the closet on Thursday, July 22.(850)  Ms. Williams put the key on her key chain and held it through the weekend, taking it with her to Mr. Foster's funeral in Arkansas.(851)

<P>Ms. Huber, however, testified that, after she locked the closet on July 22, she returned the key to its usual keeping place, in an envelope in the desk drawer of the office in the residence.(852)  The envelope was marked clearly:  "It said `key to the closet.'"(853)  The drawer was not locked, according to Ms. Huber, and therefore the key was readily available to anyone with access to the residence.(854)

<P>The plot thickens.  Although Ms. Williams testified that the files remained undisturbed until she transferred them to Williams & Connolly on July 27, Mr. Nussbaum testified that, a couple of days after the files were removed from Mr. Foster's office on July 22, Ms. Williams returned a Mr. Foster file to him because it should not have been among the Clintons' personal documents.  "I'm not quite sure Ms. Williams returned the document.  I believe Ms. Williams returned the document.  A residence file was returned.  There was a file that was returned because we were making an effort to send over solely personal documents which had been used -- yes -- which were in the White House counsel's office because there was an official purpose."(855)25 

<P>Mrs. Clinton's official schedule showed that she had two private meetings with Ms. Williams on July 27, one from 9:15 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and another from 10:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.(856)  Although the schedule listed Mrs. Clinton's office as the location of the meetings, records of movements within the White House maintained by the Secret Service and the White House Usher's Office indicate that Mrs. Clinton did not leave the White House Residence at all that day.(857)  Records maintained by the Secret Service and the White House Usher's office indicated that Ms. Williams was in the White House Residence on July 27 from 10:31 a.m. to 12:05 p.m., 1:35 p.m. to 2:25 p.m., and 3:20 p.m. to 4:43 p.m.(858) 

<P>Ms. Williams testified that on July 27, Robert Barnett, a partner at the law firm Williams & Connolly and the Clintons' personal attorney, came to the White House to see Mrs. Clinton.  By chance, Ms. Williams claims that she ran into Mr. Barnett while he was on the second floor of the White House Residence talking to Mrs. Clinton.(859)  According to Ms. Williams, Mr. Barnett said, "you know what?  It would make sense to get those documents over to the office,"(860) referring to the documents that Ms. Williams had moved from Mr. Foster's office to the Residence on July 22.  Mr. Barnett then called from the residence for another person from Williams & Connolly to come for the documents.  When that person arrived, according to Ms. Williams, she accompanied him to the residence, unlocked the closet with the key on her keyring, and pointed the documents out to him.(861)

<P>Mr. Barnett had a far different and more believable recollection of Ms. Williams' role in the transfer of the files.  He testified that Ms. Williams called him specifically to arrange a transfer of the files, and "I spoke with her about picking up the documents."(862)  On July 27, he went to the White House to pick up the documents.  Capricia Marshall, Ms. Clinton's assistant, met him at the gate, signed him in with the Secret Service, and escorted him to the Second Floor to wait for Ms. Williams.(863)  Records show that Mr. Barnett arrived at the White House at 2:57 p.m.(864), registering "First Lady" as his visitee with Secret Service, and entered the White House Residence at 3:03 p.m.(865)  About 20 minutes later, Ms. Williams came and escorted Mr. Barnett up to the third floor closet where the files were kept.(866)  The box was open, and Mr. Barnett went through the files, briefly examining their contents.(867)  When he finished the review, Mr. Barnett asked Ms. Williams for tape and sealed the box.(868)

<P>Mr. Barnett then called Ingram P. Barlow, the comptroller of Williams & Connolly, to come over and pick up the box from the White House.(869)  Mr. Barnett gave Ms. Williams Mr. Barlow's name and social security number for her to clear him in with the Secret Service, and left at 4:30 p.m.(870)  Mr. Barnett denied seeing Mrs. Clinton while he was in the White House Residence.(871)

<P>Mr. Barlow of Williams & Connolly arrived at the White House Residence at 4:38 p.m.(872)  He was escorted to the third floor closet, where he took possession of the box.  Consistent with Mr. Barnett's testimony, the box was sealed in packing tape when Mr. Barlow saw it in the closet.(873)

<P>Mr. Barnett called Susan Thomases at her office on July 26, 1993 and left a message.(874)  Ms. Thomases did not recall returning Mr. Barnett's call, nor did she recall making plans to go to the White House on July 27.(875)  Secret Service records, however, indicate that Susan Thomases entered the White House at 2:50 p.m. on July 27.(876)  Because Ms. Thomases had a White House pass at that time, the Secret Service entry records did not list the purpose of her visit or her intended destination.  Records maintained at the White House Residence, however, indicated that she entered the Residence at 3:08 p.m., five minutes after Mr. Barnett.  Records maintained by the White House Residence Usher's Office further indicate that Mr. Barnett and Ms. Thomases exited the White House Residence together.(877)  Mr. Barnett testified, however, that he did not recall seeing Ms. Thomases in the White House Residence.  

<P>Although Mr. Barnett testified that he did not recall seeing Mrs. Clinton during his visit on July 27, Ms. Williams testified that she recalled seeing Mr. Barnett talking with Mrs. Clinton when she ran into him in the Residence that afternoon.  

<P>Telephone records produced by Ms. Thomases indicate that she called Patricia Solis Doyle, Mrs. Clinton's scheduler, on the evening of July 26, 1993.(878)  Ms. Thomases does not recall why she spoke with Ms. Solis, and does not recall whether she called Ms. Solis to schedule an appointment to see Mrs. Clinton.(879)

<P>On the morning of July 27, Ms. Solis called Ms. Thomases in her New York office and left a message.  The message read, "HRC wants to see you today."(880)  The message contained a check mark, which, according to Ms. Thomases, signified that she had returned the call.  Indeed, telephone records indicate that, at 11:33 a.m. on July 27, Ms. Thomases called Ms. Solis from her Washington office and spoke for 10 minutes.(881)  Her telephone records further indicate that, in the 40 minutes between 12:20 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. on July 27, Ms. Thomases called the White House four times.  Later that afternoon, at 1:30 p.m., Ms. Thomases received another message from Evelyn Lieberman in the First Lady's office.  It stated, "Please call Hillary."(882)

<P>Ms. Thomases testified that as of the end of the day on July 26, she did not have any firm plan or compelling reason to come to Washington the next day, July 27.(883)  Her normal day to be in Washington was Wednesday.  According to Ms. Solis, it was not customary for Mrs. Clinton to summon Ms. Thomases to Washington on a particular day.  "That's not normally the way it works.  If Mrs. Clinton wanted to see Susan, she'd ask is she in town, do you know what her schedule is, can she come by."(884)  

<P>Interestingly, Ms. Thomases professed that she could not explain why she went to Washington on July 27.  Ms. Thomases did not recall scheduling a meeting with or seeing the Mrs. Clinton on July 27.(885)  Indeed, Ms. Thomases testified that she did not even have a specific recollection of even being in the White House Residence that day.  Secret Service records and the White House Residence Usher's logs indicate, however, that Ms. Thomases arrived at the White House at 2:50 p.m. on July 27, and went up to the second floor of the White House Residence at 3:08 p.m.(886)  In addition, records indicate that Ms. Thomases made two telephone calls from the White House Residence on July 27, 1993, and charged them to her telephone calling card.(887)

B.<P>White House Deliberations About the Handling of the Note.

<P>In the morning of July 27th, after the regular White House staff meeting, Mr. Nussbaum met with Mr. McLarty, Mr. Burton, and Mr. Gergen to discuss how Mr. Foster's note should be handled.(888)  Mr. McLarty thought "the note would need to be provided to the authorities, and it eventually would become public knowledge; either we would disclose it or it would become public knowledge."  However, there were "issues outstanding" that he wanted to discuss with the other White House officials.(889)  According to Mr. Gergen:, the meeting was resolved in favor of disclosing the note to the authorities as soon as possible.  "[T]here was a unanimous agreement that the issues that had been raised the night before had been resolved in the minds of those who had raised them, and it was a unanimous agreement to go forward."(890)  Mr. McLarty confirmed that at the meeting the "concerns over executive privilege had been settled."(891)

<P>Jim Hamilton, an attorney representing the Foster family, joined the meeting halfway through, at about 11:00 a.m.  He introduced a concern that was new to Mr. Gergen:

<P>He took the position -- I do not know whether, I do not know whether he knew about the existence of the note prior to coming in the room, or whether he was told, but he was very strongly of the view that before anything was done with the note, Mrs. Foster needed to be informed of the contents and needed to be informed that there was a note, and he needed to sit down with her and talk about it.(892)

Mr. Hamilton told those at the meeting that Mrs. Foster was flying from Arkansas, and would arrive early in the afternoon, at about 2:30 p.m.(893)  Mr. Hamilton said that he agreed that the note should be turned over to the authorities, but he did not know what Mrs. Foster's reaction would be to the note.(894)  After consulting with Mrs. Foster, Mr. Hamilton returned to the White House and said that Mrs. Foster assented to turning the note over to the authorities.(895)

<P>White House officials also discussed how to disclose the note to the authorities.  "I think there'd been some discussion in our staff meetings about whether it ought to go to the Justice Department or the Park Police," Mr. Gergen said.  "There was some uncertainty on the part of the White House about what the appropriate channel was to make sure it got there."(896)  The officials discussed whether the Park Police could be trusted not to leak the existence or contents of the note to the press.(897)  They also feared that disclosure of Mr. Foster's note might prompt the authorities to reopen investigations into the matters spelled out in the note.  "I recall there was some speculation about whether the contents of the note might prompt legal authorities to look further in to the issues raised by the note.  In other words, to go beyond the scope of the immediate investigation over his mental state."(898)

<P>The controversy over the White House Travel Office was specifically mentioned.(899)  According to Mr. Gergen:

<P>I believe with regard to the Travelgate matter [he] said the FBI lied.  He accused the FBI of lying, I believe -- I can't -- I don't remember the exact details of this, but there was a discussion within the White House of whether upon receipt of that or once the note was turned over to the authorities -- this was discussions I recall we had on Tuesday, on the day when the note was turned over -- whether that would prompt or the Attorney General would feel forced, having received that, to launch an investigation about what he was talking about.  You know, did the FBI lie?  That was the point that I was trying to make in the deposition.  Inevitably, there were points raised in the note that were clearly going to prompt a lot of attention by the press and by others, and that particular point was on the one about the FBI lying.(900)26 

<P>The documents produced by the White House to the Special Committee included two pages of undated, handwritten notes by Bill Burton.  At the top the first page, Mr. Burton listed the names of the persons present at the meeting on July 27:  Jim Hamilton, Bernard Nussbaum, Bill Burton, David Gergen, Mack McLarty.(901)  Further down in his notes, Mr. Burton wrote "2 pts" with an arrow pointing to the following:

<P><P>far happier if disc.

<P><P>if someone other than Bernie



<P><P>if worried about usher's office

<P><P>    discuss with me.(902)

On the second page, Mr. Burton wrote the following:  "We have disc a personal writing of Mr. Foster reflecting his depressed state.  In deference to the family, no further commt."(903)  Mr. Burton testified that "disc." on the first page meant "discussed" or "disclosed", and the same notation of the second page was shorthand for "discovered".  Senator Grams noted the inconsistency in Mr. Burton's answer and pointed out further that, on the first page, when Mr. Burton meant "discussed" in the last line of the notes, he wrote out the entire word.  Mr. Burton explained that he used a variety of abbreviations.  "I use some standard Associated Press abbreviations; I use some of my own shorthand. Sometimes d-i-s-c means discussed.  Sometimes it means discovered.  Sometimes it means disclosed."(904)

C.<P>The President Is Told of the Note.

<P>Mr. McLarty called Mrs. Foster's house after the morning meeting and then learned that Mrs. Foster was traveling back from Arkansas to Washington.(905)  She arrived in Washington in the afternoon, at about 2:30 p.m.  She was then taken to the White House to view the note and agreed to disclose the note to the authorities.(906)

<P> Even though it had been agreed at the morning meeting that the President would be notified as soon as possible so that the note could be turned over to the authorities, Mr. McLarty claims that he did not notify the President until late in the afternoon because the President had a full schedule and because Mrs. Foster had not been notified.(907)  At 6:00 p.m.,(908) Mr. McLarty, Mr. Gergen, and Mr. Nussbaum went into the Oval Office to tell the President about the note.  According to Mr. McLarty, Mr. Nussbaum explained to the President the existence of the note and either "read him the note or outlined what was in the contents."  The three men explained to the President that Mrs. Foster had already been notified, or would be shortly, and that they intended to turn the note over to the authorities.  Mr. McLarty testified that the President accepted their report, and "he said do with it as you think is right, give it to the authorities; and that was about it."(909)

<P>Mr. Gergen testified that the President did not indicate that he knew about the note before the 6:00 p.m. meeting, although Mr. Gergen "couldn't tell from his reaction whether he knew."(910)  By then, Mrs. Clinton had known of the note for over 24 hours.  Senator Grams observed that "[i]t seems kind of strange knowing that this was one of his best friends and all of the speculation surrounding looking for a suicide note that night, and then finally when something was found, he didn't -- wasn't inquisitive; he didn't inquire about it; he didn't seem to want to know more information except for to say you handle it the best way you know how." (911)

D.<P>The White House Finally Turns the Note Over to Law Enforcement.

<P>Some time in the afternoon, Mr. McLarty called Attorney General Janet Reno and asked her to come to the White House that evening, at about 7:00 p.m.(912) Deputy Attorney General Heymann recalled accompanying Attorney General Reno to the White House: 

<P>I rode over with the Attorney General on the evening of Tuesday the 27th.  We had a 7:00 meeting. We had not been told what it was about, though.  I thought it was probably about the Foster matter.  We were shown into Mr. McLarty's office.  The only -- I think at first only Mr. Gergen, David Gergen was there.  Then Mr. Nussbaum came in and Mr. Burton, I believe, and certainly Mr. McLarty.  There had been some small talk before that.(913)

<P>Mr. Nussbaum began the meeting by informing Attorney General Reno and Mr. Heymann of the existence of the note, producing the note, and reading them a transcript of the note.  Mr. Nussbaum then asked the Justice Department Officials what "should be done with it."  Attorney General Reno told Mr. Nussbaum to "turn it over to the Park Police immediately."(914)

<P>Attorney General Reno questioned Mr. Nussbaum about the long delay in disclosing the note to the proper authorities:

<P>She then asked why are we just getting it now if it was found I guess it's 30 hours -- it was 30 hours before then.  The White House people, I don't know whether it was Mr. Nussbaum or who, said that there was -- they wanted first to show it to Mrs. Foster and they wanted to show it to the President who might, if he had wanted to, have asserted executive privilege, they said.  They said they were not able to get to the President until late on the 27th and as soon as they got to the President and made the President aware of the note, they had called us.(915)

Attorney General Reno, who had to leave, asked Mr. Heymann to stay and take care of the matter.  Mr. Heymann then called Mr. Margolis and asked him to call the Park Police immediately.(916)

<P>Apparently unbeknownst to Attorney General Reno and Deputy Attorney General Heymann, Webster Hubbell, the Associate Attorney General, was in the White House Residence while Ms. Reno and Mr. Heymann were in the White House to receive the note.  Mr. Hubbell's records indicate that Mrs. Clinton had called his office and left a message at 2:30 p.m. that afternoon.(917)  White House logs indicate that Mr. Hubbell arrived at the Residence at 6:29 p.m. and remained there until 8:19 p.m.(918)  Ms. Thomases, who was in the Residence at the same time as Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Hubbell, exited the White House at approximately the same time.(919)  Neither Ms. Thomases nor Mr. Hubbell recalled discussing the note with each other or with Mrs. Clinton on that day.  Ms. Thomases testified, "I don't know that Hillary Clinton and I have ever discussed that writing."(920)

<P>Ms. Thomases acknowledged that she met with Mr. Hubbell and Mrs. Clinton in the Residence following Mr. Foster's death, but she did not recall whether the gathering occurred on July 27:(921)27   She claimed that the three shared only memories of Mr. Foster:

<P>We just talked about the tragedy of Vince's death and we talked about how sad it was, and I remember that the first time the three of us were together, we talked a little bit about some of the good times that we had had together and old times before Bill Clinton was elected President, and in the days in which I used to see them.(922) 



<P>Mr. Hubbell testified that he learned about the note when he "read it in the newspaper."(923)  When asked about his trip to the White House on July 27, Mr. Hubbell testified that he went to the White House to give Mrs. Clinton an account of Mr. Foster's funeral after Mrs. Clinton left.  "I remember that I had to go to the White House to tell Hillary about what had gone on after they left the funeral, but I don't have any memory of doing it."(924)  He testified that it was part of the grieving process:  "We, as Southerners, we have large long funerals and we get together and drink and eat and talk and do it for days.  And Hillary had missed that grieving process, and I remember my wife saying, Hillary needs to talk to you.  She needs to understand who was there and things of that sort."(925)  Implausibly, he did not recall seeing Ms. Thomases or discuss the Mr. Foster's note with Mrs. Clinton.(926)  

<P>After Mr. Heymann called the Park Police, Officer Joseph Megby of the Park Police went to the White House.  Mr. Nussbaum began to assemble the note.(927)  Some of the pieces fell, and Mr. Nussbaum and others picked them up.   Mr. Heymann testified that "the note fell down, a number of the pieces of the note fell down on the floor and there was a scramble to pick them up."(928)  He noted at the time that "by the time it had been reassembled, the fingerprints of everybody in the White House were on it.  So if anybody wanted fingerprints, they had all the fingerprints in the world."(929)28 

<P>Mr. Nussbaum then gave the note to Officer Megby and concluded the meeting.  Heymann urged Officer Megby to ask any questions that he might have, but the officer declined.  It was not until later that Mr. Heymann learned that Officer Megby "was simply a duty officer.  This was probably all new to him."(930)

<P>The circumstances surrounding the discovery of the note and the delay in turning it over to the authorities disturbed Mr. Heymann and caused him to question the level of cooperation that the White House provided to the investigation into Mr. Foster's death.  The next day, July 28, 1993, Mr. Heymann met with Mr. Margolis  and instructed him to ask the FBI to conduct a thorough investigation into the discovery of the note.  Mr. Heymann specifically told them to be "very aggressive,"(931) and Mr. Margolis described the investigation as an "800-pound gorilla."(932)  Mr. Heymann and Mr. Margolis identified the jurisdictional predicate for the investigation as obstruction of justice,(933) and FBI documents confirmed that the subject matter was "possible obstruction of justice of U.S. Park Police investigation of death of Vincent Foster, Counsel to the President."(934)

<P>This sentiment was shared by the Park Police, who complained about the lack of White House cooperation to number two official of the Interior Department.  Mr. Heymann testified that, on July 29, 1993, he received a call from Thomas Collier, the Chief of Staff to the Secretary of Interior, asking for help.  Mr. Collier told Mr. Heymann that "the Park Police are very, very upset about the investigation....  He said that they really couldn't get the cooperation that they wanted, and he said that he wanted to pull the Park Police out and he'd like me to substitute the FBI for the Park Police.".(935)  Mr. Heymann did not want to pull the Park Police from the investigation, but told Mr. Collier that the FBI, at Mr. Heymann's request, were already involved in the White House investigation.  Mr. Heymann also assured Mr. Collier that he would intervene with the White House to ensure future cooperation.

<P>Mr. Heymann then called David Gergen at the White House and explained the problems that the Park Police investigators were encountering.  Mr. Gergen told Mr. Heymann that he would call back in a few minutes so that Mr. Gergen could assemble a number of White House personnel in his office.(936)  When Mr. Gergen called back, he was on a speakerphone with a number of White House officials, "eight or nine or ten people".(937)  Mr. Gergen does not have a clear memory of the conversation, but he testified that Mr. Heymann "may have conveyed to me a sense of, not a precise x, y, z, here's what you guys are doing, but a sense of watch it, you know, an alert.  Make sure the White House was doing this, to remind me in effect, these are very highly charged kinds of investigations and they can be misunderstood very easily."(938)

<P>Mr. Heymann's recollection is clearer:

<P><P>I read them the riot act in unmistakable terms, telling them that this was a disaster very near to occur, that I was sending, I had sent the FBI in to interview on the note.  That I wanted all interviews to take place without White House counsel there.   That I wanted full cooperation.  That there was a very good chance that nothing could avoid sort of a major failure of credibility and sense of biased investigation, but that only the most vigorous of steps, at this point, could do that, and I wanted a complete turnaround.(939)



According to Mr. Heymann, he deliberately delivered a "very strong message" seeking to change the White House attitude toward the investigation.(940)  He received some, but not much, argument from the White House officials involved in the conference call.  After the conversation, according to Mr. Heymann, "the cooperation with the Park Police and with the FBI turned around immediately and completely."(941)

     <H2>FINDINGS OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE</H2>

<P>In the course of its investigation, the Special Committee was confronted with witnesses who provided conflicting testimony about events highly relevant to the Special Committee's inquiry.  To resolve these conflicts in testimony, Senate Resolution 120 authorized the Special Committee to make factual findings based on the available evidence.  In doing so, the Special Committee placed primary emphasis on documentary or other physical evidence whenever such evidence was available and when there was no indication that such evidence had been altered or otherwise compromised.  When judgments of credibility had to be made, the Special Committee focused on the factors that, from common sense and logic, contribute to the reliability of a person's testimony--factors such as a motive to lie or embellish, the detail and vividness of memory, and the internal and external consistency of a person's overall testimony.  The Special Committee summarizes its factual findings below.

<P>Finding 1.<P>At the time of his death, Vincent Foster was intimately involved in two brewing scandals--Travelgate and Whitewater--touching on President and Mrs. Clinton.

<P>Mr. Foster played a central role in both the firing of the Travel Office staff and subsequent attempts to conceal Mrs. Clinton's true role in the firings.  Mr. Foster participated in the May 12, 1993 meeting with Harry Thomasson, Catherine Cornelius, and David Watkins where the replacement of the Travel Office staff was first discussed.(942)  Mr. Foster then assigned his former law partner, William Kennedy, to investigate alleged financial mismanagement in the Travel Office.  When the July 2, 1993 report of an internal White House review into the matter sharply reprimanded Mr. Kennedy,  Mr. Foster felt personally responsible and insisted that Mr. Nussbaum allow him to shoulder the blame.(943)

<P>Mr. Watkins' belatedly disclosed memorandum concerning the Travel Office affair clearly outlined Mr. Foster's extensive involvement as Mrs. Clinton's conduit to the firings.  Mr. Kennedy wrote, for example, "Once this made it on the First Lady's agenda, Vince Foster became involved, and he and Harry Thomason regularly informed me of her attention to the Travel Office situation -- as well as her insistence that the situation be resolved immediately by replacing the Travel Office staff."(944)  Indeed, Mr. Watkins fingered Mr. Foster as the person who directly communicated to him Mrs. Clinton's order that the Travel Office staff be fired.  "Foster regularly informed me that the First Lady was concerned and desired action -- the action desired was the firing of the Travel Office staff."(945)  Despite Mrs. Clinton's obvious and extensive involvement in the firing of the staff, Mr. Foster and other White House officials did not disclose to investigators probing the affair about her true role.  

<P>It is also undisputed that Mr. Foster played a central role in the effort to respond to and manage the brewing Whitewater scandal.  When questions first arose in the 1992 campaign about Whitewater and Mrs. Clinton's representation of Mr. McDougal's Madison Guaranty, Mr. Foster compiled the files and billing records of the Rose Law Firm relating to that representation.(946)  He and Mr. Hubbell improperly removed the files from the Rose Law Firm without authorization and transported them to Washington after the campaign.  In order to "[g]et out of White Water,"(947) Mr. Foster also perfected the sale of the Clintons' interest in Whitewater to Mr. McDougal.(948)  

<P>After becoming Deputy White House Counsel, Mr. Foster continued his role as the Clintons' personal counsel on Whitewater.  He was assigned the task of preparing the Clintons' tax returns for 1992 in order to reflect properly the sale of their shares in Whitewater,(949) a problem that his notes described as a "can of worms you shouldn't open."(950)  Mr. Foster worked with other White House officials in the Spring of 1993 in coordinating a response to questions about Whitewater.(951)  And Mr. Foster's telephone log indicated an inexplicable message from Mr. McDougal on June 16, 1993, "re tax returns of HRC, VWF and McDougal."(952)  

<P>Finding 2.<P>Senior White House officials were aware that the President and Mrs. Clinton faced potential liability over Whitewater and their relationship with the McDougals.

<P>Before the Special Committee, Mr. Nussbaum boldly announced:  "The Whitewater matter, which subsequently became the focus of so much attention, was not on our minds or even in our consciousness in July 1993."(953)  The testimonial and evidentiary record belies Mr. Nussbaum's exculpatory declaration.

<P>Questions about Whitewater and Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison were a major campaign issue in 1992, so much so that the Clintons took the extraordinary step of retaining Jame Lyons, an "outside attorney," to issue a report on the matter.  Mr. Foster and Mr. Hubbell at that time compiled the files and billing records of the Rose Law Firm relating to Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison,(954) and transported the files to Washington after the campaign.  And Mr. Foster was specifically tasked to prepare the Clintons' personal tax returns as they relate to Whitewater,(955) a project which consumed his time in the White House.

<P>More important, as early as 1992, the Clintons and their advisors were aware that questions about Whitewater would again resurface, this time in a criminal investigation.  In the fall of 1992, Betsey Wright heard of a "criminal referral regarding a savings and loan official in Arkansas and . . . involv[ing] the Clintons."(956)  Ms. Wright learned specifically that the RTC had just sent a "criminal referral up to the prosecutor in Little Rock."(957)  She passed this news onto Mrs. Clinton.(958)  

<P>According to RTC Senior Vice President William H. Roelle, former Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Roger Altman, upon taking office, directed the staff to inform him of all important or potentially high-visibility issues.(959)  Mr. Roelle testified that, on or about March 23, 1993, he told Mr. Altman that the RTC had sent a criminal referral mentioning the Clintons to the Justice Department.(960)  Mr. Altman immediately sent Mr. Nussbaum two facsimiles about Whitewater.  The first facsimile, sent on March 23, 1993 with a handwritten cover sheet, forwarded an "RTC Clip Sheet" of a March 9, 1992 New York Times article with the headline, "Clinton Defends Real-Estate Deal."(961)  The article reported the responses that Bill Clinton, then a presidential candidate, offered to an earlier Times report detailing the Clintons' investment in Whitewater and their ties to Jim and Susan McDougal.  The second facsimile from Mr. Altman to Mr. Nussbaum, sent the next day, March 24, 1993, forwarded the same article that was sent the day before and portions of the earlier Times report--an article dated March 8, 1992, by Jeff Gerth entitled "Clintons Joined S&L Operator in an Ozark Real-Estate Venture," which originally broke the story in the news media.(962)

<P>In addition, SBA Associate Administrator Wayne Foren testified that, in early May 1993, he briefed Erskine Bowles, the new SBA Administrator about the agency's ongoing investigation of David Hale's Capital Management Services because the case involved President Clinton.(963)  Shortly thereafter, Mr. Bowles told Mr. Foren that he had briefed White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty about the case.(964)  Although Mr. Bowles did not recall being briefed by Mr. Foren about Capital Management(965) or talking to Mr. McLarty about the case,(966) Mr. Foren's account was corroborated by his deputy, Charles Shepperson.(967)  Mr. McLarty's calendar indicated that Mr. Bowles had two meetings with Mr. McLarty at the White House in early May 1993.(968)

<P>Mr. Foster's role in response to Whitewater was known in the White House.  Ricki Seidman, former Deputy Director of Communications in the White House, reported to the FBI that she and Mr. Foster had worked together on Whitewater issues before his death.  Specifically, she recalled that she worked with Mr. Foster in April 1993 in connection with the Clintons' tax returns.(969)  Seidman participated in the discussions from a "communications perspective,"(970) thus indicating the White House's identification of Whitewater as a potential issue in the spring of 1993.  Indeed, according to the FBI report of Ms. Seidman's interview, "it was believed the tax returns would bring the Whitewater issue into the `public domain again.'"(971)  And Ms. Seidman stated that there was discussion in the White House regarding "the `soundest way' to seek closure to the issue."(972)

<P>Given this overwhelming evidence, the Special Committee finds that White House officials knew about Mr. Foster's work for the Clintons on Whitewater, and that, at the time of his death, the Clinton White House was acutely aware that Whitewater was a potential political and criminal matter.

<P>Finding 3.<P>Senior White House officials ignored repeated requests by law enforcement officials to seal Mr. Foster's office on the night of his death.

<P>Nine different persons recalled four separate requests to White House officials to seal Vincent Foster's office on the evening of July 20.  Park Police investigator Sergeant Cheryl Braun testified that, as she left the Foster residence, she asked Assistant to the President David Watkins to seal Mr. Foster's office.(973)  Detective John Rolla expressly corroborated her testimony.(974)  Park Police Major Robert Hines testified that he called and asked another senior White House official, Bill Burton, to seal Mr. Foster's office.(975)  Another White House official, Sylvia Mathews, testified that she overheard Mr. Burton's conversation with the Park Police(976) and that right after the telephone call, Mr. Burton asked Counsel to the President Bernard Nussbaum to seal the office.(977)

<P>Counselor to the President David Gergen testified that he asked Director of Communications Mark Gearan whether Mr. Foster's office was sealed.(978)  Mr. Gearan then asked Mr. Burton, who assured Mr. Gearan that the office had been sealed.(979)  Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell testified that both his wife and Marsha Scott remembered him calling Chief of Staff Mack McLarty on the night of Mr. Foster's death to ask that Mr. Foster's office be sealed.(980)  All the persons who received these requests to seal Mr. Foster's office denied having been asked to do so.

<P>Mr. Watkins was the critical person in the failure to seal Mr. Foster's office on the night of his death.  He received a specific request from the Park Police to seal Mr. Foster's office.  Instead of doing so, he directed his assistant, Patsy Thomasson, to search the office.  Mr. Watkins was intimately involved, along with Mr. Foster, in firing the career Travel Office staff and in the apparent subsequent cover up before investigators.  In a memorandum drafted in the Fall of 1993, Mr. Watkins described in detail Mr. Foster's and Mrs. Clinton's role in the Travelgate affair.  He wrote that "Foster regularly informed me that the First Lady was concerned and desired action -- the action desired was the firing of the Travel Office staff."(981)  The memorandum also revealed that, right before the firing of the Travel Office staff, White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty met with Mr. Watkins and Ms. Thomasson and explained that the issue was on Mrs. Clinton's "radar screen" and that "immediate action must be taken."(982)  At all times, however, the White House had maintained that Mrs. Clinton was not involved in the Travel Office matter; Mrs. Clinton and numerous other White House officials had made public statements that she had "no role" in the firing of the staff.  Mr. Watkins' knowledge of Mrs. Clinton's true involvement in Travelgate, efforts by White House officials to conceal that involvement, and Mr. Foster's direct role in both the firing and the cover-up provides an obvious and powerful motive to violate the instructions of the Park Police to seal Mr. Foster's office.  Instead, Mr. Watkins directed his trusted assistant, Patsy Thomasson, to search Mr. Foster's office.

<P>The Special Committee finds that the overwhelming weight of the evidence established that senior White House officials received multiple requests to seal Mr. Foster's office on the night of his death.  The testimony of Sylvia Mathews, a White House official with absolutely no motivation to mislead the Special Committee, was corroborated by notes that she prepared within one week of Mr. Foster's death.(983)  And Bill Burton's undated notes listed Webster Hubbell's name and telephone numbers next to the reminder "1) Secure Office".(984)  This testimonial and documentary evidence is uncontradicted; the White House officials have testified simply that they did not recall the requests to seal Mr. Foster's office.

<P>It is undisputed that, contrary to the requests of law enforcement, Mr. Foster's office was not sealed the night of his death.

<P>Finding 4.<P>White House officials conducted an improper search of Mr. Foster's office on the night of his death.

<P>The Special Committee received testimony that David Watkins and Bernard Nussbaum both received requests to seal Mr. Foster's office.  Instead of taking steps to seal Mr. Foster's office, however, Mr. Watkins paged Patsy Thomasson and instructed her to go to into Mr. Foster's office to search for a note.(985)  Ms. Thomasson was aware of Mr. Foster's role in the Travel Office matter.(986)  Mr. Nussbaum then joined Ms. Thomasson in that search.(987)  It is unclear what motivated, or whether anyone instructed, Margaret Williams to go into Mr. Foster's office, but the Special Committee finds improbable Ms. Williams' testimony that she went to Mr. Foster's office in the hope that "I would walk in and I would find Vince Foster there and we would have a chat sitting on his couch, as we have done so many times before."(988)

Ms. Williams testified that she did not even mention to Mrs. Clinton the search of Mr. Foster's office in her telephone call at 12:56 a.m. on July 21 -- for example, that no note was found possibly explaining Mr. Foster's decision to take his own life.(989)  They had already spoken earlier in the night about the fact of Mr. Foster's death.

<P>Ms. Williams did not recall talking to Ms. Thomases on the evening of Mr. Foster's death.(990)  Of her conversation with Ms. Williams that night, Ms. Thomases testified: "I don't recollect speaking with her that night.  That's not to say that she didn't call me back and I didn't speak to her, but I have no independent recollection of having spoken with her that night."(991)

<P>In the end, the documentary evidence showing the sequence of phone calls in the early hours of July 21, after Ms. Williams had entered Mr. Foster's office, reasonably leads to the conclusion that Ms. Williams called Ms. Thomases and Mrs. Clinton to report the results of the search of Mr. Foster's office.

<P>Finding 5.<P>Margaret Williams may have removed files from the White House Counsel suite on the night of his death.

<P>Secret Service Officer Henry O'Neill testified that, on the night of Mr. Foster's death, he specifically saw Margaret Williams remove file folders, three to five inches thick, from the White House Counsel suite and placed them in her office.(992)  As Ms. Williams walked past Officer O'Neill to her office, her assistant, Evelyn Lieberman, said to Officer O'Neill: "'that's Maggie Williams; she's the First Lady's chief of staff.'"(993)  Ms. Williams denied removing any files and her attorney submitted the results of polygraph tests indicating that she was truthful in her denial.(994)

<P>The Special Committee finds the testimony of Officer O'Neill to be credible.  Officer O'Neill, a career officer with the Secret Service Uniformed Division, has no motive to lie.  He has a clear recollection of the critical events on the evening of Mr. Foster's death, and he is certain that he saw Ms. Williams remove the documents.  He was situated in an excellent position in the narrow hall between the White House Counsel suite and Ms. Williams' office, and his memory is punctuated by Evelyn Lieberman's introduction of Ms. Williams.

<P>Although the results of Ms. Williams' polygraph examinations should be given some weight, there are reasons to question the probative value of those examinations.  First, polygraph tests are generally unreliable--a recognition that in part led to the adoption of the Polygraph Protection Act of 1987.29   Second, Ms. Williams was given three and probably four examinations by her private polygrapher before submitting to a test by the Independent Counsel.(995)  A person may increase her chances of being found "truthful" by taking multiple polygraph examinations.  Subjects are approximately 25 percent more likely to pass polygraph examinations with two practice exams, according to one study.30   

<P>Finding 6.<P>Bernard Nussbaum agreed with Justice Department officials on July 21, 1993, to allow law enforcement officials to review documents in Mr. Foster's office.

<P>Philip Heymann testified that he and Mr. Nussbaum agreed on July 21, 1993, as to the procedures for reviewing the documents in Mr. Foster's office.(996)  David Margolis and Roger Adams, whom Mr. Heymann sent to the White House to conduct the review as agreed, corroborated Mr. Heymann's recollection.(997)  Mr. Nussbaum does not recall discussing procedures for reviewing Mr. Foster's office with Mr. Heymann on July 21.  Mr. Margolis and Mr. Adams testified that, in Mr. Nussbaum's office that evening, they finalized the agreement between Mr. Heymann and Mr. Nussbaum.(998)  Mr. Nussbaum and his associates in the White House counsel's office denied reaching any agreement.(999)

<P>The Special Committee finds that the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that Mr. Nussbaum agreed with the Justice Department on July 21 with respect to the procedures for reviewing the documents in Mr. Foster's office.  Mr. Heymann's specific and detailed recollection of his afternoon conversation with Mr. Nussbaum stands in stark contrast to Mr. Nussbaum's very hazy recollection that Mr. Heymann may "get other people involved" in the investigation.  Mr. Margolis and Mr. Adams finalized Mr. Heymann's agreement when they met with Mr. Nussbaum, Mr. Sloan and Mr. Neuwirth later in the afternoon.(1000)  The testimony of Mr. Margolis and Mr. Adams is corroborated by notes made by Mr. Adams within one week of the meeting and by Cynthia Monaco's dictated diaries(1001) and a contemporaneous FBI teletype describing the meeting.(1002)

<P>There is independent evidence confirming that Mr. Nussbaum agreed with the Justice Department on the procedures for reviewing documents in Mr. Foster's office.  Mr. Margolis and Mr. Adams testified that, during the later afternoon meeting, Mr. Nussbaum overruled and corrected Mr. Neuwirth when Mr. Neuwirth stated that Mr. Nussbaum alone would review the documents in Mr. Foster's office.(1003)  The Special Committee finds simply not credible the testimony of Mr. Nussbaum, Mr. Neuwirth, and Mr. Sloan that they do not recall any such incident, given their vivid and specific denial of any such agreement with the Justice Department.  

<P>Finding 7.<P>Margaret Williams and Susan Thomases, in consultation with Mrs. Clinton, took part in formulating the procedure for reviewing documents in Mr. Foster's office on July 22, 1993.

<P>Mr. Nussbaum agreed with Justice Department officials on July 21, 1993, to an "entirely sensible plan"(1004) to review jointly documents in Mr. Foster's office.  The next day, however, he broke the agreement, reviewed the documents himself, and permitted Margaret Williams, Mrs. Clinton's Chief of Staff, to participate in a second review and to remove documents from Mr. Foster's office.  Given this sequence of events, which fundamentally changed the manner in which documents in Mr. Foster's office were handled, the obvious question that the Special Committee faced was, why?

<P>Records obtained by the Special Committee(1005) showed the following sequence of telephone calls in the early hours of July 22:

<P>Mr. Nussbaum testified that, when he answered Ms. Thomases' page, Ms. Thomases asked him about the upcoming review of Mr. Foster's office and said that unspecified "people are concerned" about Mr. Nussbaum's plan to allow law enforcement officials to participate in the review.(1006)

<P>Later in the day, according to Associate Counsel to the President Stephen Neuwirth, Mr. Nussbaum told Mr. Neuwirth that Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Thomases were concerned about the law enforcement authorities having "unfettered access" to Mr. Foster's office.(1007)

<P>Ms. Thomases acknowledged that she talked with Mr. Nussbaum about the review, but only at his instigation, and she denied expressing any concern or reservation about the review procedures.(1008)  She testified that she had no conversations with Mrs. Clinton about the review of documents in Mr. Foster's office.(1009)

<P>Ms. Williams did not recall having any conversations about the document review.

<P>The Special Committee finds that there is substantial, indeed compelling, evidence indicating that Ms. Williams and Ms. Thomases, in consultation with Mrs. Clinton, participated in formulating the procedure for reviewing documents in Mr. Foster's office on July 22, 1993.  Although Ms. Williams and Ms. Thomases both denied speaking with Mrs. Clinton about the review of documents, the sequence of contiguous telephone calls from Ms. Williams to Mrs. Clinton, from Mrs. Clinton to Ms. Thomases, and from Ms. Thomases to Mr. Nussbaum leads to the unmistakable conclusion that these early morning phone calls precipitated Mr. Nussbaum's change of procedure.

<P>The testimony of White House lawyers directly support this <P>Finding.  According to Mr. Neuwirth's important testimony, Mr. Nussbaum understood, from a prior conversation with Ms. Thomases, that Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Thomases were concerned about the prospect of unfettered access to Mr. Foster's papers.  Although Ms. Thomases denied that she intervened in the formulation of the search procedure, Mr. Nussbaum testified that Ms. Thomases attempted to impose her views on how to conduct the review, an attempt that he claimed to have rebuffed.

<P>By breaking his agreement with law enforcement over the terms of the search of Mr. Foster's office, Mr. Nussbaum demonstrated that he clearly took the concerns of Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Thomases into account.  Mrs. Clinton, however, persists in her story that she had no involvement in the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office.  In public statements, she maintained that "[t]here were no documents taken out of Vince Foster's office on the night he died.  And I did not direct anyone to interfere in any investigation."(1010)  Although this statement may be technically correct, that Mrs. Clinton did not "direct" anyone to "interfere" with investigations, the evidence established that she communicated concerns about the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office.  Those concerns were passed on, in Mrs. Clinton's name and by someone known to have her authority, to White House officials.(1011)  Here, as in Travelgate, that is enough.  The invocation of Mrs. Clinton's interest in the matter commands a "clear" message: "immediate action must be taken."(1012)  And the action taken, denying investigators access to documents in Mr. Foster's office, had the effect of interfering with the investigation.  The Special Committee and the American people deserves candor, not lawyerly word games.

<P>The documentary evidence establishes that Ms. Thomases and Ms. Williams remained directly involved in the process of reviewing the documents.  Tellingly, throughout July 22, Ms. Thomases made repeated phone calls to the offices of Mack McLarty and Ms. Williams.31   Records produced to the Special Committee showed the following calls by Ms. Thomases to the White House on July 22, 1993:

Ms. Thomases thus remained in close touch with the White House while Mr. Nussbaum finalized the search procedures and announced to the law enforcement officials, at about 1:00 p.m., the decision that he alone would review the documents in the Mr. Foster's office.

<P>Contrary to certain public statements by the White House, Ms. Williams clearly was involved in the actual review and removal of documents from Mr. Foster's office on July 22.32   After Mr. Nussbaum reviewed the documents in Mr. Foster's office in front of law enforcement, he and Margaret Williams conducted a second review -- the real review.  Ms. Williams then removed the Clintons' personal documents from Mr. Foster's office and transferred them to the residence, telling Thomas Castleton that "the President or the First Lady had to review the contents of the boxes to determine what was in them."(1013)  Ms. Williams called Mrs. Clinton before putting the files in the residence, and, at 5:13 p.m., apparently after Ms. Williams had completed the transfer of files, Ms. Thomases called Ms. Williams' office and talked for nine minutes.  At 7:12 p.m., Ms. Thomases put in a final call, one-minute call to Mrs. Clinton at the Rodham residence.(1014)

<P>The sequence of documented telephone calls and their correlation to activities surrounding the review and removal of documents from Mr. Foster's office on July 22 leads to the inescapable conclusion that Ms. Thomases and Ms. Williams, in consultation with, or acting at the direction of, Mrs. Clinton, prevailed upon Mr. Nussbaum to abandon his procedure for reviewing documents in Mr. Foster's office and to replace it with one that prevented law enforcement officials from having access to Mr. Foster's papers and that permitted Ms. Williams to review and remove documents from Mr. Foster's office.

<P>Finding 8.<P>Bernard Nussbaum failed to conduct a meaningful review of Mr. Foster's office and did not describe to law enforcement officials sensitive files pertaining to the Clintons and the Administration.

<P>Mr. Nussbaum testified that he conducted a comprehensive review and described each file in Mr. Foster's office--including all the files in Mr. Foster's credenza, where a number of the Clintons' personal files were kept.  Notes taken by Mr. Spafford of the review demonstrate, however, that he provided only a very generic description, "matters re First Family"(1015); Mr. Sloan's notes are similar: "Various investment matters re: First Family."(1016)  This single general description by Mr. Nussbaum identified a number of files that Margaret Williams later transferred to the White House residence and eventually to the Clinton's personal lawyers at Williams & Connolly.  Among these files was Mr. Foster's Whitewater file; no one at the review recalled Mr. Nussbaum making any reference whatsoever to Whitewater.

<P>Although Mr. Nussbaum testified that Whitewater was not the subject of discussion in the White House at the time of Mr. Foster's death, the Special Committee finds that there was ample evidence indicating that in early 1993, the White House, and particularly Mrs. Clinton, knew that Whitewater was a potential public issue.  Whitewater had been an issue during the 1992 presidential campaign.  In late 1992, Betsey Wright, the coordinator of the Arkansas defense effort and former chief of staff to Governor Clinton, learned of a "criminal referral regarding a savings and loan official in Arkansas and ... involv[ing] the Clintons."(1017)   Upon hearing the news, she attempted to gather more information and directly told Mrs. Clinton about the referral.(1018)   And the information was circulated within the campaign.  Jim Lyons, author of the Whitewater report, testified that someone in the Clinton campaign notified him of the criminal referral.

<P>Whitewater remained a live issue when the Clintons moved into the White House.  Ricki Seidman, then Deputy Director of Communications for the White House, told the FBI that she discussed and attended meetings with Mr. Foster and the Clintons' outside counsel in April 1993 about the tax treatment of the Clinton's Whitewater investment because "it was believed the tax returns would bring the Whitewater issue into the `public domain' again."(1019)  In addition, records that the White House produced to the Special Committee after the conclusion of its public hearings indicate that James McDougal, the Clintons' Whitewater partner, called Mr. Foster at the White House just prior to his death.

<P>The Special Committee also finds that Mr. Nussbaum failed to describe adequately the contents of Mr. Foster's briefcase.  Although notes taken by Mr. Spafford and Mr. Sloan indicated that the briefcase contained a copy of the White House Travel Office Management Review, Mr. Nussbaum did not disclose that most of the contents of the briefcase pertained to the Travelgate controversy.(1020)  Specifically, Mr. Nussbaum removed Mr. Foster's notebook on the Travel Office matter from the briefcase and kept it in his office until Mr. Nussbaum's resignation in March 1994.(1021)  According to Mr. Spafford's notes, Mr. Nussbaum described the notebook as "Notebook of notes of meetings, GC [General Counsel] issues"; Mr. Sloan's notes similarly identified the notebook simply as "Notes re: meeting".(1022)  The notebook and other Travel Office documents in Mr. Foster's briefcase were not turned over to the Independent Counsel until April 5, 1995.(1023)





<P>Finding 9.<P>An index of documents in Mr. Foster's office is missing and other indices were revised following his death to conceal possible references to Whitewater.

<P>Mr. Foster's secretary, Deborah Gorham, testified that, on July 22, she entered Mr. Foster's office and opened the drawer containing the Clintons' personal documents.  "I saw Pendaflex folders and file folders, and I did not see an index that normally would have been there listing the names of the files."(1024)  Ms. Gorham maintained an index for every drawer; this one was missing.

<P>The Special Committee received three indices from the White House reflecting all the files in Mr. Foster's office.  Two are dated July 22, 1993.(1025)  One is shown to be last revised on October 25, 1993.(1026)  It is thus undisputed that the indices were compiled or revised after Mr. Foster's death.  None makes any reference to a Whitewater file known to be in Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death.

<P>The evidence before the Special Committee indicates that the indices were revised in order to remove an earlier reference to the Whitewater file.  Deborah Gorham testified that she made an index in the Spring of 1993, probably late April, and that the index reflected all the files in Mr. Foster's office at the time.(1027)  She also testified that the Whitewater file was among the files in Mr. Foster's office at the time she prepared the index.(1028)

<P>The Special Committee finds Ms. Gorham's testimony highly credible.  Ms. Gorham was careful and meticulous, identifying with certainty to the Special Committee particular characteristics of indices she maintained.  Moreover, independent evidence corroborates Ms. Gorham's recollection that Whitewater was among the files in Mr. Foster's office in April 1993.  Mr. Foster prepared the Clintons' 1992 tax returns, and one of the key issues in those returns was how to treat the Clintons' investment in Whitewater.  It is therefore highly likely that the Whitewater file was in Mr. Foster's office in April 1993, when the tax returns were due, instead of being brought into the office at a later date.

<P>Finding 10.<P>Bernard Nussbaum knew about yellow scraps of paper in Mr. Foster's briefcase prior to Stephen Neuwirth's apparent discovery on July 26, 1993.

<P>The Special Committee finds that the evidence demonstrates that Mr. Nussbaum knew about yellow scraps of paper in Mr. Foster's briefcase before Mr. Neuwirth allegedly discovered the scraps on July 26.  Mr. Spafford testified that he overheard Mr. Sloan tell Mr. Nussbaum on July 22 that there were scraps at the bottom of the briefcase.(1029)  Although neither Mr. Sloan nor Mr. Nussbaum recalled the exchange, Mr. Spafford testified that he remembered and had a privileged conversation about the incident the following week, right after he learned that Mr. Neuwirth had discovered the note in Mr. Foster's briefcase.(1030)

<P>In addition, Deborah Gorham testified that in the days after Mr. Foster's death, she told Mr. Nussbaum that she saw a file folder and something yellow, possibly "Post-it" notes in Mr. Foster's briefcase.(1031)  Ms. Gorham further testified that after Mr. Neuwirth discovered the note, Mr. Nussbaum grilled her at length about what she saw in Mr. Foster's briefcase the previous week.(1032)  Although Mr. Nussbaum testified that he did not recall grilling Ms. Gorham,(1033) the Special Committee finds her vivid recollection of Mr. Nussbaum's interrogation to be highly credible.  Mr. Nussbaum's interrogation, described by Ms. Gorham as "forceful" and "adamant",(1034) leads to the obvious inference that he was concerned about what Ms. Gorham had seen the previous week and how it would undercut his story about the discovery of the note.

<P>The Special Committee finds that Mr. Nussbaum must have known on July 22 that scraps of paper were in Mr. Foster's briefcase.  The briefcase has no flaps or inside seams that could conceal 27 pieces of yellow paper.  Captain Charles Hume remarked that the "oldest and blindest" Park Police officer would have found the note on July 22,(1035) and Sergeant Peter Markland testified that he thought Mr. Nussbaum lied when he said the note was discovered in the briefcase.(1036)  Even White House official, Bill Burton, testified that he was incredulous when he learned that Mr. Neuwirth discovered the note in Mr. Foster's briefcase.(1037)

<P>David Margolis, the career Justice Department official coordinating the investigation, offered this testimony:

<P>I thought I had this figured out, that the torn-up scraps of paper were not in the briefcase the day that Mr. Nussbaum did the search in our presence.  That's what -- that was the explanation I came up with, and that somebody -- that it had never been there before and somebody put it in afterward or it had been there, somebody took it out and then decided they better put it back because there was public speculation of, you know, where is the suicide note.



<P><P>So, in my own mind, I speculated that must be what happened.  But then, when I picked up the paper one day and saw that Mr. Spafford said that the note had been in there when the search was conducted, I am at a loss now.  I just have no explanation.  I don't know.(1038)

The Justice Department and the FBI did not have the information Mr. Spafford provided to the Special Committee when the FBI closed its investigation into the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the note.

<P>Mr. Nussbaum's conduct may be explained by the fact that law enforcement officials and Mr. Spafford were still at the White House when the existence of the scraps of paper was called to his attention by Mr. Sloan.  Rather than examining the scraps then and there, Mr. Nussbaum chose to put off such an examination until such time as he could be sure that he could do so in private.  

<P>Finding 11.<P>Margaret Williams, in consultation with Mrs. Clinton, removed files from Mr. Foster's office to the White House residence to be reviewed by the Clintons.

<P>Thomas Castleton testified that, as he helped Margaret Williams transport the Clintons' personal files to the White House residence on July 22, Ms. Williams told Mr. Castleton that she was taking the files to the residence so that the Clintons could review them.(1039)  Mr. Nussbaum testified that he discussed taking the files to the residence with Ms. Williams so that the Clintons could decide which lawyer to send them to.(1040)  Ms. Williams, however, testified that she alone made the independent determination to place the files in the residence.(1041)  Although Ms. Williams admitted calling Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Williams claimed that their discussion was limited simply to where to place the files in the residence.(1042)  

<P>The Special Committee finds that the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that Ms. Williams did not, as she asserted, make an independent decision to transfer the Clintons' personal files to the White House residence.

<P>Ms. Williams' story is not credible given Mr. Nussbaum's testimony that they had discussed taking the files to the residence before Ms. Williams left Mr. Foster's office.  Carolyn Huber testified that July 22 was the first time ever that Ms. Williams had placed files in the White House Residence.(1043)  Ms. Williams did not plausibly explain why she thought the residence--and not her office or somewhere else in the West Wing--was the appropriate place for the files or how personally transferring files to the residence was less taxing than having them picked up by a Williams & Connolly representative.

<P>Ms. Williams testified that, despite having never discussed the files with Ms. Williams, Mrs. Clinton did not ask any questions--even one--but simply told her to arrange the details with Ms. Huber.  Ms. Williams explained this seemingly odd response by suggesting that "I could have told Mrs. Clinton that I was going to put 44 elephants in the White House the day after Vince died and she probably would have said okay"(1044)--a suggestion that the Special Committee finds to border on the contemptuous.  Moreover, Ms. Huber testified that Ms. Williams "called and said that Mrs. Clinton had asked her to call me to take her to the residence to put this box in our third floor office."(1045)<P>  The Special Committee finds that Ms. Williams intended the files to be reviewed by the Clintons and that, in fact, someone reviewed the files before they were turned over to Williams & Connolly.  When confronted with Mr. Castleton's testimony that she said the Clintons were to review the files, Ms. Williams asked rhetorically, "Why would I tell an intern that?"(1046)  The Special Committee finds it natural that Ms. Williams would have told Mr. Castleton why the files were going to the residence--especially because, as Ms. Huber testified, Ms. Williams had never moved files to the residence.  Mr. Nussbaum testified that Ms. Williams returned a file, one dealing with White House decorations, before the Clinton personal files were transferred to Williams & Connolly.  Although, after consulting with counsel, Mr. Nussbaum stated that he was not sure that it was Ms. Williams who returned the file, he acknowledged that a file was indeed returned from the residence because it was not a Clinton personal file.(1047)  The inevitable conclusion from this testimony is that someone reviewed the files to determine which files should be returned to Mr. Nussbaum.

<P>Finding 12.<P>Senior White House officials did not provide complete and accurate information to the Park Police and FBI with respect to the handling of Mr. Foster's note.

<P>It is undisputed that Mrs. Clinton saw the note within hours of its discovery on July 26.(1048)  In addition, Susan Thomases testified that Mr. Nussbaum called and told her about the note the same afternoon.(1049)  Neither Mrs. Clinton nor Ms. Thomases were identified in the reports by the FBI or Park Police as among those who saw or knew about the note before it was turned over to the authorities.(1050)  Although Mr. Neuwirth testified that he told FBI Special Agent Salter that Mrs. Clinton was made aware of the note, his testimony is inconsistent with written records of the interview.  Neither Agent Salter's report nor his handwritten notes of the interview (later obtained by the Committee) indicated that Mr. Neuwirth told him that Mrs. Clinton was among those who saw the note.(1051)  Instead, Agent Salter's notes recorded Mr. Neuwirth's continuous narrative of the chain of events after Mr. Neuwirth discovered the note.  The narrative, however, omitted any mention of Mrs. Clinton as the second person Mr. Nussbaum brought into his office to view the note.(1052)

<P>The Special Committee finds that Mr. Neuwirth's omission of Mrs. Clinton may have been willful.  Bill Burton's handwritten record of a meeting about Mr. Foster's note on July 28, the day after the note was turned over to the authorities, listed "HRC" with an arrow pointing to an adjacent letter "n".(1053)  Because Mr. Burton testified that he did not know what his own notes meant, the Special Committee adopts the most reasonable interpretation of his notations--that those present at the meeting discussed the matter and decided not to disclose that Mrs. Clinton saw the note.

<P>Finding 13.<P>Mr. Hubbell probably knew about the discovery of Mr. Foster's note on July 27, 1993.

<P>In the hours and days following Mr. Foster's death, there was overwhelming interest in whether Mr. Foster left a note explaining the reasons for his apparent suicide.  By their own admission, Mr. Nussbaum, Ms. Thomasson, Ms. Williams, and Ms. Lieberman, testified that they conducted an improper search of Mr. Foster's office on the night of his death in order to look for a note.  Because of the seeming inexplicable nature of Mr. Foster's death and the speculations of foul play, there was a groundswell of interest in whether Mr. Foster had left a note prior to his death.  The White House released an official statement stating that "no suicide note or other document bearing on" Mr. Foster's death had been found.(1054)  And news articles in the week following Mr. Foster's death generally mentioned the anomaly that a note had not been found.(1055)

<P>On July 27, approximately 26 hours after a note in Mr. Foster's hand was discovered by White House officials, White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum finally contacted Attorney General Reno and Deputy Attorney General Heymann to turn over the note.  Apparently unbeknownst to Ms. Reno and Mr. Heymann, Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell was upstairs in the White House Residence with Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Thomases while they were downstairs receiving news of the note.  Mr. Hubbell's records indicate that Mrs. Clinton had called his office and left a message at 2:30 p.m. that afternoon.(1056)  White House logs indicate that Mr. Hubbell arrived at the Residence at 6:29 p.m. and remained there until 8:19 p.m.(1057)  Ms. Thomases, who was in the Residence at the same time as Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Hubbell, exited the White House at the same time.(1058)  Neither Ms. Thomases nor Mr. Hubbell recalled discussing the note with each other or with Mrs. Clinton on that day.  Ms. Thomases testified, "I don't know that Hillary Clinton and I have ever discussed that writing."(1059)

<P>When presented with the entry and exit logs, Ms. Thomases acknowledged that she met with Mr. Hubbell and Mrs. Clinton in the Residence following Mr. Foster's death.(1060)  Secret Service records indicate that July 27 was the only time in the week following Mr. Foster's death that Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Thomases, and Mr. Hubbell were together in the White House.  Ms. Thomases implausibly testified, however, that during there meeting the three only reminisced about Mr. Foster and their friendship.(1061) 

<P>For his part, Mr. Hubbell testified that he did not recall even seeing Ms. Thomases on July 27.(1062)  He testified that he came to the White House on July 27 in order to give Mrs. Clinton an account of Mr. Foster's funeral after Mrs. Clinton left.  "I remember that I had to go to the White House to tell Hillary about what had gone on after they left the funeral, but I don't have any memory of doing it."(1063)  He testified that it was part of the grieving process:  "We, as Southerners, we have large long funerals and we get together and drink and eat and talk and do it for days.  And Hillary had missed that grieving process, and I remember my wife saying, Hillary needs to talk to you.  She needs to understand who was there and things of that sort."(1064)  

<P>Mr. Hubbell testified that he learned about the note when he "read it in the newspaper,"(1065) and that he did not discuss the note with Mrs. Clinton during his post-funeral visit to the White House.(1066)  The Special Committee finds Mr. Hubbell's testimony incredible.  Whether there was a note was the topic of interest, inquiry, and speculation for all involved in the story of Mr. Foster's death.  White House officials conducted an improper search of Mr. Foster's office on the night of his death specifically, according to their own testimony, to look for a note.  The Park Police had specifically asked about the existence of a note on the night of his death, and continued to look for indications of why Mr. Foster took his life during its investigation.  Mr. Hubbell's high-ranking colleagues at the Justice Department were at the White House at the same time as Mr. Hubbell to receive the note from Mr. Nussbaum.  Mrs. Clinton had called Ms. Thomases repeatedly to summon her to Washington for a meeting on July 27, and Mrs. Clinton had called Mr. Hubbell on the afternoon of July 27.  Given all these events, there is little possibility that three of the persons closest to Mr. Foster--Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Thomases, and Mr. Hubbell--two of whom knew about the existence of the note, were in the private quarters of the White House together without for two hours without any mention of the note.

<P>The Special Committee adopts the most reasonable <P>Finding in light of the circumstances, that Mr. Hubbell most likely learned of the existence of the note either before or during his meeting with Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Thomases on July 27, 1993.

<P>Finding 14.<P>Margaret Williams provided inaccurate and incomplete testimony to the Special Committee in order to conceal Mrs. Clinton's role in the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office following his death.

<P>The testimony of Margaret Williams, the First Lady's Chief of Staff, to the Special Committee was frequently inconsistent with her prior statements and contradicted by the testimony of other witnesses.  These numerous and varied contradictions in Ms. Williams's testimony followed one predictable pattern:  they diminished Ms. Williams' role in the events surrounding the handling of the documents in Mr. Foster's office and, more important, concealed Mrs. Clinton's involvement in this now controversial matter.  Although Ms. Williams's testimony may not necessarily be untruthful with respect to each and every contradiction, the obvious pattern of the contradictions and inconsistencies leads inexorably to the conclusion that she did not provide complete and accurate testimony to the Special Committee.

<P>Ms. Williams testified implausibly that she entered Mr. Foster's office on the night of his death in the vain hope of Finding Mr. Foster there.(1067)  She claimed that she did not remove any files from the White House Counsel's suite and that her assistant, Evelyn Lieberman, did not even enter the suite on July 20.  Officer Henry O'Neill testified, however, that he saw Ms. Williams remove files, three to five inches thick, from the suite and place them in her office.(1068)  According to Officer O'Neill, Ms. Lieberman was there and introduced Ms. Williams to Officer O'Neill.(1069)

<P>After searching Mr. Foster's office, Ms. Williams went home and called Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Thomases.  When asked about these late-night telephone calls, Ms. Williams testified to the Special Committee that she did not talk to Mrs. Clinton about the search of Mr. Foster's office.  Ms. Williams also denied talking with Susan Thomases.(1070)  After being confronted with records indicating that she called Ms. Thomases at 1:10 a.m. on July 21, Ms. Williams insisted that her earlier testimony was only that she did not recall talking to Ms. Thomases.(1071)  When reminded that she actually said, "I didn't talk to her,"(1072)  Ms. Williams replied, "I'm not going to argue with you.  I think this is exactly what I said."(1073)

<P>With respect to Mrs. Clinton's involvement in the much criticized decision to keep law enforcement from reviewing documents in Mr. Foster's office on July 22, Ms. Williams did not tell the Special Committee initially about her early morning phone call to the Rodham residence.(1074)  When presented with records documenting the telephone call made at 7:44 EDT, Ms. Williams replied, "I don't remember who I talked to."(1075)  

<P>Ms. Williams initially testified that she did not speak to Susan Thomases on the telephone on July 22.(1076)  Telephone records indicated, however, that Susan Thomases called Ms. Williams' office twice on July 21 and five times on July 22.(1077)  Ms. Thomases made these repeated telephone calls to Ms. Williams' office on July 22 at the same time that White House officials were meeting to discuss the procedures for searching Mr. Foster's office.(1078)  When questioned about these calls, Ms. Williams suggested that she was at home in the morning of July 22.(1079)  Records from the U.S. Secret Service established, however, that Ms. Williams entered the White House at 8:10 a.m. on July 22.(1080)

<P>Ms. Williams testified that she did not review files in Mr. Foster's office on the afternoon of July 22, but Mr. Nussbaum testified that Ms. Williams helped him pick out the Clintons' personal files.(1081)  Deborah Gorham also testified that Ms. Williams was in Mr. Foster's office when Mr. Nussbaum asked Ms. Gorham to point out the location of the Clintons' personal files.(1082)  Ms. Williams claimed that she made a completely independent decision to have the Clintons' personal files transferred to the White House residence en route to Williams & Connolly.(1083)  Mr. Nussbaum testified, however, that he and Ms. Williams discussed the matter and decided to remove the files to the residence, and then the Clintons would decide where the files should go.(1084)  While she was in Mr. Foster's office, Ms. Williams called Mrs. Clinton.  Although the two had not talked previously about any transfer of files, Ms. Williams testified that she, improbably, asked Mrs. Clinton simply where the files should go in the residence, and had no other discussions with Mrs. Clinton about what the files contained or where they came from.(1085)  

<P>Ms. Williams asserted that she did not intend for the Clintons to review the files after they were placed in the residence.  Thomas Castleton testified, however, that Ms. Williams expressly told him that she was taking the files to the residence so the Clintons could review them.(1086)  Ms. Williams denies saying this to Mr. Castleton.(1087)  Carolyn Huber testified that, after Ms. Williams placed the files in the residence closet, Ms. Huber returned the key to its usual place, in a marked envelope in the desk drawer.(1088)  Ms. Williams, however, testified that Ms. Huber gave her the key, which Ms. Williams kept on her key chain until she had to open the closet for a Williams & Connolly representative.(1089)  Ms. Williams testified that no one reviewed the files while they were in the residence, but Mr. Nussbaum testified that someone, probably Ms. Williams, returned a residence file because it was determined not to be a Clinton personal file.(1090)

<P>Finding 15.<P>Susan Thomases provided inaccurate and incomplete testimony to the Special Committee in order to conceal Mrs. Clinton's role in the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office following his death.

<P>Susan Thomases, a prominent New York attorney, was Mrs. Clinton's conduit to the White House staff.  She was in close contact with Mrs. Clinton and the White House staff throughout the week following Mr. Foster's death.  Although the documentary and other evidence before the Special Committee established that Ms. Thomases was involved in every key event relating to the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office following his death, her testimony to the Special Committee with respect to these key events was often implausible, incomplete or inaccurate.

<P>When Ms. Thomases first appeared before the Special Committee, on August 8, 1995, she was asked whether she had discussed her appearance with Mrs. Clinton.  Ms. Thomases testified, "I did not discuss my opinion--my appearance here today with Hillary Clinton."(1091)  On December 18, 1995, however, Ms. Thomases contradicted herself by admitting that she had actually talked with Mrs. Clinton about her appearance "way back when, before the first hearing."  According to Ms. Thomases, she and Mrs. Clinton discussed "that I was going to have to come down, and that I didn't think that I had very much interesting to tell you, that you were still going to ask me the questions because you felt the need to ask me the questions."(1092)

<P>On the night of Mr. Foster's death, Ms. Thomases paged Ms. Williams at 12:15 a.m., while Ms. Williams was at the White House.  When asked whether she talked to Margaret Williams after Ms. Williams searched Mr. Foster's office, Ms. Thomases claimed that she did not "recollect speaking with [Ms. Williams] that night.  That's not to say that she didn't call me back and I didn't speak to her, but I have no independent recollection of having spoken with her that night."(1093)  The Committee later obtained telephone records, however, indicating that Ms. Williams, right after speaking with Mrs. Clinton, called Ms. Thomases at 1:10 a.m. and spoke for 14 minutes.(1094)

<P>With respect to her role in changing the procedures for reviewing documents in Mr. Foster's office, Ms. Thomases acknowledged that she spoke with Bernard Nussbaum on July 22.  According to Ms. Thomases, Mr. Nussbaum brought up the subject of reviewing documents in Mr. Foster's office and described his plan of action, to which Ms. Thomases replied simply that it "sounds good to me."(1095)  Mr. Nussbaum, however, testified that Ms. Thomases initiated the discussion, said that "people were concerned" about the review, and attempted to impose her views on the proper procedures.(1096)  Even more importantly, Associate White House Counsel Stephen Neuwirth testified that Mr. Nussbaum understood from the conversation that Ms. Thomases and Mrs. Clinton were concerned about law enforcement officials having "unfettered access" to Mr. Foster's office.(1097)

<P>Ms. Thomases testified that "I don't remember ever having a conversation with Hillary Clinton during the period after Vince Foster's death about the documents in Vince Foster's office."(1098)  Telephone records, however, established that, after receiving the early morning call from Ms. Williams, Mrs. Clinton called Ms. Thomases at 6:57 a.m. CDT on July 22, and talked for three minutes.(1099)  Ms. Thomases then immediately paged Mr. Nussbaum at the White House and subsequently expressed her concerns about the search procedures.(1100)  Even after confronted with these telephone records, Ms. Thomases maintained that she called Mr. Nussbaum merely to commiserate because she was "worried about my friend Bernie."(1101)  Ms. Thomases testified that her early-morning conversation with Mrs. Clinton was about "the possibility that I didn't feel well enough to go to Little Rock" for Mr. Foster's funeral.(1102)

<P>When questioned about the repeated telephone calls she made to Ms. Williams's office on July 22 at the same time that White House officials were meeting to discuss the procedures for searching Mr. Foster's office, Ms. Thomases claimed that she probably was attempting not to reach Ms. Williams but rather to be transferred to someone else in the White House.(1103)  Ms. Thomases also implausibly suggested that she may have been put on hold during these lengthy calls, for as long as nine minutes,(1104) despite her earlier testimony that July 22 was "a very, very busy day in my work."(1105)

<P>Finally, U.S. Secret Service records established that Ms. Thomases entered the White House at 2:50 p.m. on July 27.(1106)  Within ten minutes of her entry, Robert Barnett arrived at the White House to meet with Mrs. Clinton.(1107)  During this visit, Mr. Barnett reviewed the Clintons' personal files, previously in Mr. Foster's office, and transferred them from the White House residence to Williams & Connolly.(1108)  Ms. Thomases left the White House at 8:20 p.m., after Mr. Nussbaum had turned the note apparently in Mr. Foster's handwriting over to Attorney General Janet Reno.  When asked about this unusual visit to the White House--Ms. Thomases is normally in Washington on Wednesdays(1109)--Ms. Thomases testified that she implausibly had "no specific recollection of being at the White House on the 27th."(1110)

<P>Finding 16.<P>Bernard Nussbaum provided inaccurate and incomplete testimony to the Special Committee concerning the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office following his death. 

<P>As members of the Special Committee recognized previously, "a witness' response of `I don't recall' or `I don't remember' may also be a false statement to the Committee."(1111)

<P>Bernard Nussbaum did not recall Bill Burton asking him to seal Mr. Foster's office on the night of Mr. Foster's death.(1112)  Sylvia Mathews testified that she overheard the conversation,(1113) and her notes supported the testimony.(1114)

<P>Mr. Nussbaum did not recall talking to Philip Heymann on July 21 about the procedures for reviewing documents in Mr. Foster's office.(1115)  Mr. Heymann testified that he and Mr. Nussbaum agreed that Justice Department lawyers would review the documents;(1116) David Margolis,(1117) Roger Adams,(1118) and Charles Hume(1119) testified that Mr. Heymann so described the procedure to them on July 21.

<P>Mr. Nussbaum did not recall overruling Mr. Neuwirth when Mr. Neuwirth stated in the evening of July 21 that Mr. Nussbaum would review the documents.(1120)  Mr. Adams and Mr. Margolis described the incident in detail at the time to other Justice Department officials and later to the Special Committee.(1121)

<P>Mr. Nussbaum did not recall telling Mr. Neuwirth that Ms. Thomases and Mrs. Clinton were concerned about investigators having "unfettered access" to Mr. Foster's office.(1122)

<P>Mr. Nussbaum did not recall telling Mr. Heymann on July 22 that he would call Mr. Heymann back before conducting the search.(1123)  

<P>Mr. Nussbaum did not recall Mr. Margolis or Mr. Heymann telling him on July 22 that he was making a "terrible mistake" by changing the procedures.(1124)  

<P>Mr. Nussbaum did not recall Mr. Heymann calling him in the evening and asking him, "Bernie, are you hiding something?"(1125)  

<P>Mr. Nussbaum did not recall telling Susan Thomases about the note on July 26.(1126)

<P>The frequency of these memory lapses contrasted with Mr. Nussbaum's very definite recollection of other purported facts -- facts that put his conduct in a more favorable light.  Mr. Nussbaum was sure that no one removed any files from Mr. Foster's office on the night of his death.  He was sure that there was no agreement with the Justice Department with respect to procedures to review documents in Mr. Foster's office.  He was sure that there was no discussions in the White House about Whitewater at the time of Mr. Foster's death.

<P>Whether a product of deliberate deception or selective memory, Mr. Nussbaum's frequent and convenient assertions that he did not recall important, often damaging, events lead the Special Committee to the obvious conclusion that Mr. Nussbaum provided incomplete and inaccurate testimony to the Special Committee.

<P>*<P>*<P>*

<P>The Committee's ability to investigate fully the true facts concerning the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office following his death has been hindered by the often incomplete and inaccurate testimony of key witnesses.  In conjunction with this report of findings, the Special Committee has voted to refer the matter, including the testimony of specific witnesses, to the Office of Independent Counsel for investigation of possible criminal violations.

<P>In sum, notwithstanding the pattern of stonewalling by the White House and other witnesses, the Special Committee uncovered evidence that clearly established a pattern of highly improper conduct by senior White House officials in the days following Mr. Foster's death.  The Committee and the American people will never know exactly what happened in Mr. Foster's office in the days after his death -- what documents were removed, whether any documents were destroyed, and whether any evidence of ethical or even criminal misconduct was covered up.  The misguided actions of senior White House officials raise not only questions of impropriety, but also raise the specter that investigations were impeded and justice thwarted

<B>CONCLUSIONS OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON THE DISCOVERY  

OF THE ROSE LAW FIRM BILLING RECORDS </B>    291<BR><BR>



     1.     The Rose billing records provide the best evidence of the legal services performed by Mrs. Clinton for Madison Guaranty.     291<BR>

     2.     The disappearance and mysterious reappearance of the Rose Law Firm billing records was part of a larger patten of removal, concealment and, at times, destruction of records concerning Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison.     297<BR>

<P><P>-- Handwritten notes of Mark Gearan, former Director of White House Communications.





<P>Our nation rests on the principle that all Americans are equal under the law.  No one, including the President, is entitled to special treatment in a civil or criminal investigation of their conduct.  The power of the presidency may not be used to obtain a legal defense for the President and his associates unavailable to other citizens.

<P>During the 1992 presidential campaign, questions surfaced about the relationship of then-Governor Clinton and Mrs. Clinton and James McDougal, the owner of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association ("Madison Guaranty") and the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater Development Corporation, Inc. ("Whitewater").  Within the past month, a jury in Little Rock, Arkansas convicted Mr. McDougal, his former wife, Susan, and Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker of numerous federal crimes relating to the activities of Madison Guaranty and, in part, the operation of Whitewater.

<P> McDougal-Tucker convictions grew out of an investigation begun during the 1992 presidential campaign by investigators of the Resolution Trust Corporation ("RTC").  This RTC investigation culminated in a series of criminal referrals to the United States Attorney's Office in Little Rock naming the Clintons as witnesses to suspected criminal activity.  These significant convictions also rested on a parallel inquiry begun in 1992 by the Small Business Administration ("SBA") of Capital Management Services, Inc. ("CMS"), a small business investment company.

<P>Within months of the inauguration of President Clinton, senior Administration officials began to take steps to minimize the legal and political damage to the Clintons arising from these investigations.  These officials seriously misused their public offices for the Clintons' private benefit, obtained confidential law enforcement information from the RTC and SBA relating to investigations touching on the Clintons, and they attempted to interfere in ongoing law enforcement investigations.

<P>During hearings in the summer of 1994, the Senate Banking Committee examined -- in deference to the investigation of Special Counsel Robert Fiske -- only the propriety of certain communications in late 1993 and early 1994 between senior officials of the White House and the Treasury Department concerning confidential RTC criminal referrals involving Madison and Whitewater.  The White House then claimed that its receipt of this confidential law enforcement information was appropriate to allow the President to respond to press inquiries and to protect the President from inadvertently engaging in meetings that later could prove embarrassing.  No one -- and certainly no member of the Banking Committee -- asserted that the President was entitled to use such information to further his personal legal interests.

<P>Rather than being limited to the narrow question before the Banking Committee in the 103rd Congress, and without objection by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, the Special Committee examined all aspects of the Clinton Administration's response to ongoing investigations of Whitewater and related matters.  This broader inquiry revealed that in 1993 and 1994, senior Administration officials took steps that went far beyond what was necessary to respond to press inquiries.  Indeed, when the full picture is examined, the claim that Administration officials were innocently gathering information so they could respond to press inquires collapses entirely.

<P>   After careful review of all the evidence, including evidence obtained by the Banking Committee during the summer of 1994, the Special Committee concludes that senior Administration officials -- in the White House, the Treasury and Justice Departments, the RTC and the SBA -- engaged in a pattern of highly improper conduct in responding to investigations of the Clintons' involvement in Whitewater and related matters.

<P>This pattern cannot be explained as the result of a series of lapses in judgment.  The Committee concludes that these Administration officials deliberately misused their public offices to advance the purely private interests of the President and Mrs. Clinton.  Raising the possibility of obstruction of justice, they repeatedly attempted to hinder, impede and control investigations of Whitewater and related matters by the RTC, the Justice Department, the Inspectors General of the RTC and Treasury Departments, and even the Senate.

<P>Because of misdeeds of the White House, perhaps the American people will never know  the full extent to which the highly improper actions of Administration officials prejudiced the outcome of inquiries involving Whitewater, Madison Guaranty and related matters.  But the available facts clearly demonstrate that Administration officials improperly used the power of their offices in a wrongful attempt to ensure that ongoing federal investigations resulted in the least amount of legal and political damage to the President and Mrs. Clinton.

<P>*   *   *

1.<P>By mid-1993, the Clintons and their associates had already taken steps to minimize their potential liability from investigations of Whitewater and Madison Guaranty.

<P>The pattern of concealment, interference and abuse of power surrounding the Clintons' response to federal investigations of Whitewater and Madison Guaranty began in the mid-1980s.

<P>On July 2, 1986, the Arkansas Securities Commissioner, Beverly Bassett Schaffer, warned Governor Clinton that federal regulators were about to remove James McDougal from the management of Madison Guaranty.  Specifically, she wrote to the Governor's chief counsel that the S&L was in "serious trouble."(2)  

<P>On July 14, just four days after the Federal Home Loan Bank Board removed Mr. McDougal from Madison, Mrs. Clinton terminated her law firm's relationship with Madison Guaranty and returned the unused portion of the S&L's retainer.(3)  That same day, Governor Clinton erroneously advised his Chief of Staff, Betsey Wright, that he and Mrs. Clinton were no longer partners of Mr. McDougal in the Whitewater real estate investment.(4)

<P>In 1988, after federal regulators had taken over Madison Guaranty and were investigating insider dealing that contributed to the S&L's collapse, Mrs. Clinton took the questionable step of ordering the destruction of records reflecting her and her law firm's work for Madison.(5)  At the time, Seth Ward, a former associate of Mr. McDougal, was suing Madison Guaranty over a land deal that federal regulators have described as a fraud.  The Committee has recently obtained evidence indicating that Mrs. Clinton herself may have had greater involvement in creating documents that concealed irregular loans between Mr. Ward and Madison than her own statements admit.(6)

<P>In late fall 1992, Mrs. Clinton learned of an RTC "criminal referral regarding a savings and loan official in Arkansas and . . . involv[ing] the Clintons."(7)  After the election, her law partner and Mr. Ward's son-in-law, Webster Hubbell secretly and improperly removed the firm's client files for Madison without obtaining the approval of the firm or the RTC, which at this point owned them in its capacity as conservator of Madison Guaranty.(8)  In anticipation of the possibility that the Clintons might need the Madison files (as well as other client files) to respond to an inquiry, Mr. Hubbell brought the records from Little Rock to Washington -- storing them in his basement for almost a year.  In some instances, Mr. Hubbell left the firm with no copies of the relevant files, including billing records.

<P>By March 1993, senior Clinton Administration officials confirmed that the RTC had sent a criminal referral mentioning the Clintons to the Justice Department.  Specifically, RTC Senior Vice President William Roelle advised Roger Altman, then Deputy Treasury Secretary and a close associate of the President, of the existence of the RTC referral involving the Clintons.(9)

<P>In a pattern that would be repeated, Mr. Altman signaled the White House about this confidential RTC information which was not yet the subject of any press inquiries.  On March 23 and 24, Mr. Altman sent Mr. Nussbaum, by facsimile, two news articles, written the year before, concerning the Clintons' Whitewater investment.(10)  

<P>In early May 1993, again prior to any press inquiries, the White House learned of another investigation relating to President Clinton.  Former SBA Associate Administrator Wayne Foren testified that David Hale, who was a key prosecution witness in the recently concluded McDougal-Tucker trial, told him that he had access and influence with Governor Tucker and President Clinton.(11)  On May 5, Mr. Foren briefed Erskine Bowles, the new SBA Administrator, on the agency's investigation of CMS and Mr. Hale.(12)  Mr. Foren and his deputy understood that Mr. Bowles passed this confidential information to White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty.(13)  

2.<P>The White House concealed damaging evidence about Whitewater and Travelgate from career law enforcement officials investigating Vincent Foster's death.

<P>In July 1993, as described in Part I of this Report, senior White House officials engaged in highly improper conduct in handling the documents in the office of former White House Deputy Counsel Vincent Foster following his death.  By the time of Mr. Foster's death, the Clintons and their associates were aware that the Clintons' involvement with Whitewater and Madison Guaranty might subject them to liability, and that Mr. Foster's office might contain damaging evidence about the Whitewater and Travelgate affairs.  Over the objection of the Deputy Attorney General and at the direction of Mrs. Clinton, senior White House officials prevented law enforcement officials from examining Mr. Foster's records.  Mrs. Clinton's Chief of Staff, Margaret Williams, then transferred damaging Whitewater files to the White House Residence for review by the President and Mrs. Clinton.

3.<P>Senior White House officials improperly gathered confidential information about investigations involving Whitewater and Madison Guaranty.

<P>By the summer of 1993, the White House began to obtain information about the looming Whitewater investigation.  On August 17, Randy Coleman, David Hale's attorney, told Associate White House Counsel William Kennedy that Mr. Hale was under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, that he expected to be indicted soon, and that the investigation could affect the President.(14)

<P>Several days later, Mr. Kennedy -- not the Clintons' private counsel -- called Mr. Coleman, who commented that if Heidi Fleiss "was madam to the stars, David Hale was the lender to the political elite in Arkansas."(15)  Mr. Coleman told Mr. Kennedy that Mr. Hale's firm had made a number of improper loans involving politicians, including Governor Clinton.(16)  Mr. Kennedy advised Counsel to the President Bernard Nussbaum of Hale's allegations against the President.(17)

<P>Sometime in September, the White House apparently obtained confidential information from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Little Rock, through Mr. McDougal's counsel, regarding the likelihood that Mr. McDougal would be indicted imminently.(18)

<P> By late September 1993, the RTC Office of Investigations in Kansas City prepared nine criminal referrals related to Madison Guaranty.  The submission of the referrals to the Justice Department was, however, delayed by a week due to a demand by lawyers in the RTC's Professional Liability Section to perform a "legal review" of the referrals.

<P>During that week, Jean Hanson, the General Counsel of the Department of Treasury, which oversaw the RTC and its investigations, informed White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum and Associate White House Counsel Clifford Sloan that there were several RTC referrals involving Madison, Whitewater, and the Clintons.(19)  Ms. Hanson told Mr. Nussbaum that the President and Mrs. Clinton were identified as possible witnesses to the suspected crimes at issue in the referrals.(20)  Ms. Hanson also told Mr. Nussbaum that the referrals referenced possible improper campaign contributions from Madison to one of Mr. Clinton's gubernatorial campaign.(21)  Mr. Nussbaum admitted that Ms. Hanson provided him with nonpublic information about the referrals.(22)

<P>This improper transmittal of confidential RTC information was a violation of clearly established RTC procedures as criminal referrals derived from records of financial institutions are subject to the restrictions of the Right to Financial Privacy Act.(23)  

<P>The day after this private conversation, on September 30, Ms. Hanson called Mr. Sloan to amplify on the confidential information she had provided(24) and informed him that the nine referrals, among other things, referred to Governor Jim Guy Tucker,(25) named a Clinton gubernatorial campaign as a "co-conspirator,"(26) and mentioned the Clintons as potential witnesses.(27)  In accordance with instructions from Mr. Nussbaum, Mr. Sloan relayed this information to Bruce Lindsey on or about September 30.(28)  

<P>On October 4 or 5, 1993, Mr. Lindsey apprised President Clinton of the criminal referrals.(29)  It is highly likely that Mr. Lindsey told the President, a former Governor of Arkansas, that his immediate successor was mentioned in a criminal referral.  When asked about President Clinton's response, Mr. Lindsey testified that "it was certainly nothing other than just sort of, `hmmmmmmm.'"(30)

<P>Two days later, President Clinton and Mack McLarty had meetings at the White House with Governor Tucker.(31)  Although the President and Mr. McLarty have denied briefing Governor Tucker on the criminal referrals, senior White House officials undeniably put the President in the position where a legitimate question can be raised that such a briefing occurred.  This fact wholly undermines the White House's claim that it was entitled to receive confidential information about the RTC criminal referrals to protect the President from embarrassing meetings with persons named in those referrals.    

<P>On October 14, 1993, senior White House officials met again in Mr. Nussbaum's office with senior officials from the Treasury Department about the criminal referrals.(32)  The discussion included a detailed description of the referrals(33) including the fact that one of the referrals "involved four cashiers checks -- each for $3,000, two made payable to the Clinton for Governor Campaign and two made payable to Bill Clinton."(34)

4.<P>A pivotal event:  senior White House officials and private counsel for the Clintons participate in an improper Whitewater defense meeting.

<P>On November 5, 1993, armed with details of the confidential RTC criminal referrals obtained from the Treasury Department -- as well as information on Mr. Hale's allegations obtained from the SBA -- White House officials met with the Clintons' private lawyers, "to impart information to the Clinton's personal lawyers,"(35) and to arrange "a division of labor between personal and White House counsel for handling future Whitewater issues."(36)   

<P>When asked whether the gathering was a legal defense meeting, Mr. Lindsey testified that "that would accurately characterize the meeting."(37)  The meeting was not, according to Mr. Lindsey, for the official purpose of responding to press inquiries.(38)  The participants, for example, discussed either "vacuum[ing]," or a "vacuum" in, the Rose Law Firm's files on Madison.  In any event, members of the White House Counsel's office were clearly being employed in the service of the Clintons' private legal defense effort.

<P>Mr. Kennedy's contemporaneous notes of this meeting, which the Special Committee finally obtained after the full Senate voted to authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to institute a civil enforcement proceeding, indicate that a significant portion of the discussion was related to the confidential criminal referrals and the ongoing RTC investigation of Madison.  Among the principal topics of the meeting was the referral related to illegal contributions to Mr. Clinton's gubernatorial campaigns.(39)

<P>The Kennedy notes indicate that the White House officials imparted to the private lawyers much of the knowledge they possessed with respect to Whitewater, including confidential information.  As of November 5, the RTC considered the information about the referrals confidential and had not officially confirmed the accuracy of any press accounts about the referrals.(40)

<P>It was improper for White House officials to communicate confidential RTC or other law enforcement information to the Clintons' private lawyers to assist them in defending the Clintons against the RTC or any other potential civil or criminal enforcement actions.  The investigations of Madison raised the possibility that the President or Mrs. Clinton personally could be held liable, financially or otherwise, in connection with Rose Law Firm's representation or the activities of Whitewater.

<P>The Special Committee concludes that the decision, as reflected in the November 5 meeting of White House officials and the Clintons' private counsel to cooperate in their response to the Whitewater investigations facing the Clintons represented a fundamental and disturbing turning point in the investigation.  Although the Clintons faced adverse legal actions by the United States, they were relying on United States officials at the highest levels to defeat or avoid such actions.  After the November 5 meeting, senior White House officials could no longer assert that their Whitewater efforts were solely intended to serve the government's official interests.  The White House had completely obliterated the distinction between the public interest and the Clintons' private good.

5.<P>Senior White House officials did not pass the torch to the Clintons' new private counsel, but continued to take highly improper steps to advance the Clintons' private interests.

<P>Although the White House has claimed that the purpose of the November 5 meeting was to "pass the torch between White House lawyers who had been handling Whitewater to the newly hired attorney, David Kendall,"(41) that clearly proved not to be the case.  After the meeting, members of the White House Counsel's Office undeniably took affirmative steps to collect confidential information about the federal investigations into Whitewater -- information that private counsel could not obtain.

<P>For example, on November 16, 1993, Mr. Eggleston obtained confidential information in the form of a stack of documents "approximately one foot high" -- from the SBA about criminal referrals involving Mr. Hale.(42)  Mr. Eggleston reviewed these confidential documents for any references to President or Mrs. Clinton.  The Justice Department later demanded that Mr. Eggleston return the documents to the SBA.  Fraud Section Chief Gerald McDowell remarked:  "I've got to believe the WH counsel have done an incredibly stupid thing!"(43)  Contrary to Mr. Eggleston's denial, the Special Committee concludes that the evidence, particularly the documentary evidence, indicates that he shared this information with Bruce Lindsey, then the chief White House advisor on Whitewater.

6.<P>Senior White House officials held formal "Whitewater Response Team" meetings to protect the Clintons' private interests in ongoing federal investigations.

<P>In January 1994, a group of senior White House officials frequently met twice daily as a "Whitewater Response Team."(44)  These meetings must be viewed in context.  They went far beyond what was necessary to respond to press inquiries or to address other official matters.  The meetings were held after the critical November 5 defense meeting with the Clintons' personal counsel.  And, the Clintons' private defense counsel, Mr. Kendall, directly or indirectly participated in these meetings.

<P>During the initial Whitewater Response Meetings, senior White House officials debated the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Whitewater.  Normally, the decision whether to ask for the appointment of a special counsel would be an official matter.  The appropriateness of members of the Whitewater Response Team debating this matter, however, was fatally compromised by their earlier participation in the November 5 defense meeting.  Thus, in discussions over the wisdom of appointing a special counsel, the assembled group undeniably considered matters relevant to the Clintons' personally -- for example, whether the Clinton associates could be pressured into cooperating with the special counsel.

<P>    Mrs. Clinton opposed the appointment of a special counsel, and her opposition was the source of considerable concern within the White House.(45)  Notes taken by Communications Director Mark Gearan of a January 4, 1994 meeting reflect that Mrs. Clinton attended a meeting, then in progress, and said "this looks like a meeting I might be interested in."(46)  Mr. Gearan testified that Mrs. Clinton stayed for approximately 15 minutes,(47) and expressed her view that no special counsel be appointed.(48)

<P>Senior White House officials, and Mrs. Clinton in particular, feared that persons close to President Clinton might be indicted.  At a January 7, 1993 meeting, Mr. Nussbaum curiously said, "Indictments will be Betsey Wright."(49)  Ms. Wright was Governor Clinton's former Chief of Staff in the 1980s and handled Whitewater and other Arkansas-related matters for the 1992 Clinton Presidential campaign.(50)  A White House document marked "Confidential:  Second Draft, Summary of Arguments Re: Whitewater," dated January 10, 1994, listed reasons against the appointment of a prosecutor,(51)  including that a special counsel investigation "may result in focus on friends and associates of the President, begin to squeeze them and may subject some to indictment."(52)

<P>On January 8, 1994, Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes expressed discontent with the manner in which career Justice Department prosecutors -- Donald MacKay and Alan Carver -- were then handling the ongoing federal investigations of the Clintons.(53)  Mr. Ickes described Mr. Carver as a "bad guy" and actually said of Messrs. MacKay and Carver:  "Those guys are f------ us blue."(54)

<P>The Whitewater Response Team assigned tasks to White House attorneys that should have been handled solely by the Clintons' private attorneys.  For example, Mr. Eggleston prepared a legal analysis on the statute of limitations applicable to claims brought by the RTC and on the potential civil liability faced by the Clintons arising from their involvement with Madison Guaranty.(55)  Another White House official was assigned the task of contacting Christopher Wade, the realtor of the Whitewater property, to gather information from him.(56)

<P>The Whitewater Response Team was particularly concerned about the potentially adverse testimony of Beverly Bassett Schaffer, the former Arkansas Securities Commissioner who oversaw the regulation of Madison Guaranty in the mid-1980s.  An RTC criminal referral expressly referenced Ms. Schaffer, and her contact with Mrs. Clinton in connection with Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison Guaranty.  At a January 7 meeting, Mr. Ickes exclaimed, "[Beverly] Bassett [Schaffer] is so f----- important. [I]f we f--- this up, we're done."(57)

<P>Even the President worried about Ms. Schaffer.  In late December, he directed Messrs. Lindsey and McLarty:  "This is important to be on top of.  Bassett did a good job in [campaign] on this -- can she now?"(58)  In an effort to conceal the White House's involvement, the Response Team debated sending outside emissaries to speak with Ms. Schaffer.(59)  Shortly thereafter, Mr. Lindsey's former law partner, John Tisdale, and another Clinton confidant, Skip Rutherford, contacted Ms. Schaffer.  Mr. Tisdale reported back to Mr. Lindsey by memoranda,(60) and Mr. Rutherford discussed Ms. Schaffer with the White House.(61)  Ms. Schaffer further testified that although Mr. Rutherford did not specifically indicate he was calling on behalf of the White House, she was aware that Mr. Rutherford was "helping" Mr. McLarty in some capacity.(62)

7.<P>In early 1994, senior White House officials sought to manipulate the RTC investigation of Madison Guaranty and the Rose Law Firm.

<P>In early 1994, while the Whitewater Response Team was, in effect, plotting the Clintons' legal defense, there were substantial additional contacts between the Treasury Department and senior White House officials concerning RTC matters.  In view of the totality of the White House's involvement in defending the Clintons' private interests in this period, the impropriety of these contacts can no longer be seriously debated.  The Special Committee concludes that the contacts were improper, wrong and never should have occurred.  In reaching this conclusion, the Special Committee places particular weight on the fact that as of the time of these additional contacts, the White House participants were members of the Whitewater Response Team and had discussed the concern that the investigators might pressure Clinton associates into cooperating.  

<P>At a February 2 meeting, Deputy Treasury Secretary and Acting RTC CEO Roger Altman briefed key members of the Whitewater Response Team, who, by then, were in regular contact with the Clintons' private counsel on the status of the RTC's investigation into civil claims against the Clintons.  Specifically, Mr. Altman provided the critical confidential information that the RTC investigation probably would not be finished prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations.  Armed with this inside information, the Clintons could safely reject any RTC request for a tolling agreement.

<P>Also on February 2, having been told that the RTC would have to decide quickly, and with very incomplete information whether to bring civil claims against the Clintons, senior White House officials pressured Mr. Altman, a friend of the President, not to recuse himself.  The White House feared that RTC General Counsel Ellen Kulka would be too tough and unreasonable.  She could not be controlled, and the stakes were too high.  Ultimately, Mr. Altman gave in to the pressure; his so-called "de facto" recusal was no recusal at all.  

<P>The Special Committee concludes that this February 2 meeting is indefensible.  It never should have occurred.  At the time, Mr. Nussbaum had functioned as a critical part of the Whitewater Response Team.  He worked with private counsel for the Clintons.  He was no longer in a position to provide dispassionate policy advice to Mr. Altman about recusal.  Ironically, at this point, Mr. Nussbaum's conflict exceeded that of Mr. Altman.  The Special Committee notes that RTC General Counsel Ellen Kulka, when asked to provide confidential information to Mr. Kendall, strongly objected.(63)  At that time, senior White House officials failed to advise Ms. Kulka that they were already engaged in joint defense efforts with Mr. Kendall.

<P>  The importance to the White House of keeping the friendly Mr. Altman in the loop on the Madison case is illuminated by the mysterious discovery of the Rose Law Firm billing records in the Book Room of the White House Residence.  These records may explain why, as Mrs. Clinton's chief of staff, Margaret Williams, told Mr. Altman in early January 1994, "HRC was `paralyzed' by [Whitewater]."(64)  The records may also explain why Deputy White House Chief of Staff Ickes and the White House Counsel's office prepared a memorandum on the Rose Law Firm's and the Clintons' potential civil liability relating to the failure of Madison.

<P>The billing records indicate that Mrs. Clinton -- contrary to her previous statements -- represented Mr. McDougal's S&L in connection with the Castle Grande project, which federal regulators have criticized as a series of sham land sales and insider transactions.(65)  In fact, after reviewing the records, former Madison chief loan officer, Harry Don Denton, recently told the federal investigators that he warned Mrs. Clinton in 1986 that loan transactions she was handling involving the Castle Grande project could be irregular, but he said she "summarily dismissed" his concern.(66)

8.<P>Jay Stephens was removed from the investigation of possible civil claims against parties associated with Madison Guaranty, including the Clintons.

<P>Early in February 1994, the RTC retained the law firm of Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro, ("Pillsbury") including former Republican U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens, to investigate possible civil actions against parties associated with Madison Guaranty.  

<P>On February 25, 1994, George Stephanopoulos, Senior Advisor to the President, and Josh Steiner, Chief of Staff to Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen, discussed the RTC's decision to hire Mr. Stephens.(67)  Mr. Steiner testified that Mr. Stephanopoulos was "angry" and thought that Mr. Stephens should be disqualified from handling the matter because he had been a critic of the Clinton administration.(68)

<P>Treasury Department General Counsel Jean Hanson recalled that during one conversation Mr. Steiner told her: "Do you believe those guys?  They want to see if they can get rid of Jay Stephens."  Ms. Hanson understood that "those guys" referred to various White House officials.(69)  Ms. Hanson further testified that on a separate occasion Mr. Steiner, himself, expressed the opinion that Ms. Kulka should be fired for hiring Mr. Stephens.(70)  Moreover, Mr. Steiner wrote in his diary about his conversation with Mr. Stephanopoulos:

<P>Simply outrageous that RTC had hired him [Stephens], but even more amazing when George then suggested to me that we needed to find a way to get rid of him.  Persuaded George that firing him would be incredibly stupid and improper.(71)



<P>In hearings before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Steiner implausibly claimed that he lied in his diary.(72)  In the weeks following this contact, Mr. Stephens' role in the civil investigation of Madison Guaranty came to a halt.  The White House succeeded in what Mr. Steiner described as being "incredibly stupid and improper."(73)

<P>Mr. Stephens' name was included in Pillsbury's initial proposal to the RTC as one of the three partners in charge of the matter.(74)  And during the early stages of the investigation in February 1994, Mr. Stephens attended meetings and was in daily contact with the RTC.(75) After press reports about Mr. Steiner's conversation with Mr. Stephanopoulos appeared in the third week of March 1994, however, Mr. Stephens' role "diminished substantially," and by the summer of 1994, he was "virtually disengaged from the matter."(76)  Mr. Stephens had no involvement in drafting the Pillsbury reports.(77)  He declined the RTC's request that he place his imprimatur on the final reports.  Curiously, the RTC subsequently refused to authorize Pillsbury to correct the public misconception that Mr. Stephens authored these reports.

<P>Although the RTC ultimately concluded that it would not be cost effective to bring civil claims against the Clintons or Mrs. Clinton's law firm, the RTC was left to rely upon Pillsbury's incomplete analyses.  In fact, Mr. Stephens himself was critical of the initial draft of the Pillsbury's report on Whitewater, and his criticisms were ignored.

9.<P>Senior RTC officials sought to impede the criminal investigation of Madison.

<P>In March 1992, RTC criminal investigators based in Kansas City commenced an investigation into the failed Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan.  The RTC subsequently produced 10 criminal referrals related to Madison, one in 1992 and nine in 1993.  The lead criminal investigator on the case was Jean Lewis.  Ms. Lewis and her two supervisors, Richard Iorio and Lee Ausen, signed all 10 referrals.

<P>The Special Committee concludes that the Kansas City RTC investigators were obstructed in their investigation and were forced to contend with an environment hostile to their inquiry.  Ms. Lewis, testified that she "believe[d] there was a concerted effort to obstruct, hamper and manipulate the results of our investigation of Madison."(78)  The evidence suggests that Ms. Lewis' belief was well founded.

<P>The submission of the nine 1993 referrals to the Justice Department was delayed when attorneys in the RTC Professional Liability Section ("PLS") demanded time to perform a "legal review of them."  During the week long delay that ensued, the White House learned about the referrals and some of the confidential information they contained.  Shortly after this event, Ms. Lewis was removed as the lead criminal investigator on the Madison Guaranty case at the urging of PLS.   

<P>On August 15, 1994, the three Madison investigators were placed on "administrative leave" by RTC upper management.(79)  The three were provided with no warning or explanation whatsoever for this action.  Two weeks later, the three investigators were told to return to work.

<P>The Special Committee concludes that the most plausible explanation for this action is that it was taken in retaliation for the investigators' work on the Madison Guaranty case.  An internal investigation by the Inspector General of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") (the successor to the RTC) is ongoing.

<P>The Special Committee also concludes that April Breslaw improperly intervened in, and attempted to affect, the outcome of investigations into Madison Guaranty.

<P>In 1989, Ms. Breslaw while an attorney with the FDIC hired the Rose Law Firm to handle a malpractice suit against Madison Guaranty's former accountants.  Her decision came under fire when it was reported that Rose's representation of the government was fraught with conflicts of interest.  By 1994, both the FDIC and the RTC had commenced investigations into the Rose conflicts issue.  That year, Ms. Breslaw sought to discourage RTC employees from investigating issues related to Madison Guaranty and informed RTC investigators that senior RTC officials would prefer a certain outcome to any such investigation. 

<P>In January 1994, Ms. Breslaw warned RTC civil fraud investigator Gary Davidson that certain RTC managers would take "dim view" of him investigation Madison.  Then, in February 1994, Ms. Breslaw told Ms. Lewis in a tape recorded conversation that the "head people" at the RTC "would like to be able to say Whitewater did not cause a loss to Madison."(80)  

<P>Ms. Breslaw's testimony before the Special Committee regarding her statement to Ms. Lewis was wholly incredible.  Ms. Breslaw refused to admit that she had said the comment attributed to her and implausibly claimed that she could not recognize her own voice on the tape.

<P>It is unclear who, if anyone, instructed Ms. Breslaw to "send these messages" to the RTC investigators working on the Madison Guaranty and Rose Law Firm matters, although the telephone message pads of Webster Hubbell indicate that Ms. Breslaw and Mr. Hubbell were in contact on or about September 29, 1993.  Both Mr. Hubbell and Ms. Breslaw admit that they spoke about the investigation into the Rose Law Firm conflicts of interest relating to Madison.  They deny, however, that they discussed the "substance" of the RTC investigations.

<P>Viewed cumulatively, the Special Committee concludes that Ms. Breslaw's actions, coupled with the improper actions taken toward the RTC investigators, illustrate a concerted effort to improperly obstruct the investigations relating to Madison Guaranty and Whitewater.

10.<P>U.S. Attorney Paula Casey mishandled the RTC criminal referral referencing the President and Mrs. Clinton.

<P>The first criminal referral, Referral No. C0004, was made to Charles Banks, then U.S. Attorney, in September 1992.  Mr. Banks did not take action on the referral, but on January 27, 1993, he sent a recusal letter to the Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys, to which he never received a response.(81)  Although a decision on a criminal referral is usually issued within 60-90 days after submission, the U.S. Attorney's Office did not render a prosecutorial opinion on Referral C0004 until October 27, 1993 -- over one year after its submission.(82)

<P>Senior Justice Department officials believed that Paula Casey, Mr. Banks' successor and a former student of President Clinton, should have recused herself because of her ties to the Clintons and to Governor Jim Guy Tucker.  They communicated this view to her on several occasions.  The director and agents of the FBI similarly expressed concern that U.S. Attorney Casey should recuse herself from Madison-related matters.

<P>Moreover, contrary to Justice Department policy, Ms. Casey did not notify Main Justice with an Urgent Memorandum when she learned that the case against David Hale might involve allegations against Governor Tucker and President Clinton.  Senior officials were "surprised" that Ms. Casey had not alerted Main Justice to Mr. Hale's allegations about the President, and believed that Main Justice should have been involved in the case sooner.(83)

<P>Even after agreeing to recuse herself, Ms. Casey continued to participate actively in the Hale and Madison investigations.  She attended FBI briefings involving the investigation of Madison Guaranty and Mr. Hale.(84)  She continued to correspond with Mr. Hale's attorney about a possible plea agreement and reject the efforts of Mr. Hale to negotiate with the government.  Sometime between the middle and the end of October, she reviewed the nine new RTC criminal referrals relating to Madison Guaranty.(85)

<P>Finally, for reasons unknown, Ms. Casey formally declined prosecution on Referral C0004, even though she claimed that she already knew that she was going to recuse herself.  Justice Department officials testified that this declination was a "substantive decision" that someone who supposedly had recused herself from the matter should not have made.(86)

<P>No one in charge of handling Referral C0004 in the U.S. Attorney's office in Little Rock ever reviewed or analyzed the hundreds of pages of documentary exhibits attached to it.  Indeed, neither Ms. Casey nor her First Assistant ever reviewed the exhibits to the referral prior to declining prosecution.(87)  Senior Justice Department officials testified that Ms. Casey should have conducted an independent review of the evidence prior to declining Referral C0004.

<P>Even after his recusal from the case in November 1993,(88) Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell, a close associate of the Clintons and now a convicted felon, possessed -- in his basement -- the Clintons' personal and campaign files on Whitewater, as well as Rose Law Firm client files on Madison that he improperly took from the firm.  He was involved in the review and transfer of those files to the Clintons' personal attorney in November and December 1993.(89)  Although Mr. Hubbell was in virtually daily contact with senior White House officials, he implausibly claimed that he was kept out of the loop on the Whitewater defense effort.

<P>The Special Counsel and then Office of the Independent Counsel took over responsibility for the investigations in 1994.  The work of the Independent Counsel is ongoing, and therefore, it is unknown whether the actions of the U.S. Attorney's Office or Ms. Casey ultimately tainted the investigations in any way.  The Special Committee concludes, however, that the U.S. Attorney's Office mishandled the RTC criminal referrals and the Hale plea negotiations.

11.<P>Senior Administration officials improperly sought to manipulate the investigation of the RTC and Treasury Inspectors General into the propriety of White House-Treasury contacts.

<P>During its hearings in the summer of 1994, the Banking Committee learned that the Treasury Inspector General ("IG") furnished to the White House -- at the White House's request and a full week before the Office of Government Ethics ("OGE") opinion was publicly released -- transcripts of all depositions conducted by the RTC and Treasury IGs in the course of their investigation into the propriety of White House-Treasury contacts.

<P>The Special Committee concludes that senior Administration officials improperly sought to manipulate this investigation of the Treasury and RTC IGs.  This interference is particularly troubling given that the Treasury and RTC IGs were investigating the Administration's efforts to interfere in the underlying Whitewater/Madison investigation.

<P>Despite the fact that Department of Treasury General Counsel Jean Hanson was a subject of investigation, Francine Kerner, a member of the General Counsel's office, provided advance copies of the investigation transcripts to Ms. Hanson's staff.  The transcripts were then disseminated to other senior Treasury Department officials.(90)  The transcripts contained confidential information about RTC criminal investigations and referrals that even Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen should not have been permitted to review.  RTC IG John Adair testified that the transcripts contained 90% of the substance of the criminal referrals.(91)  

<P>Ms. Kerner also provided Ms. Hanson's staff with draft copies of the RTC-IG's conclusions and asked Ms. Hanson's staff to edit the proposed OGE report.(92)  The Treasury IG's chief investigator, James Cottos, objected to Ms. Kerner's attempts to alter the draft investigative report.  He told Ms. Kerner "we were not the Jean Hanson defense team."  In addition, according to Mr. Cottos, "I felt they were slanting the facts or attempting to slant the facts."(93)  Clark Blight, the chief investigator for the RTC IG, similarly testified that he was under the impression that Ms. Kerner was "an advocate for the White House."(94)  

<P>The Special Committee is deeply concerned that Treasury Department officials caused the transfer of confidential transcripts of investigative depositions to the White House.  This disturbing action was taken without the knowledge or consent of the RTC IG.  In fact, members of the RTC IG's office had voiced their opposition to such a transfer when the idea was raised.  When they learned of the transfer, after the fact, they were "shocked" by the communication of this confidential information to the White House.(95)

<P>During the Banking Committee's hearings, senior White House officials relied repeatedly on the OGE opinion as evidence that White House personnel had not engaged in improper conduct.(96)  The Special Committee discovered that this reliance was entirely misplaced.

<P>In particular, Stephen Potts, Director of OGE, testified that, contrary to statements made by White House Special Counsel Lloyd Cutler to the Banking Committee in August 1994, the OGE did not "informally concur" in Mr. Cutler's conclusion that White House officials did not violate ethical standards with regard to the communication of confidential RTC information from the Treasury Department to the White House.(97)

<P>Mr. Cutler admitted to the Special Committee that he may have "transgressed" and "may have gone too far when he testified" before the Banking Committee in August 1994. (98)   12.<P>The White House delayed in producing documents to the Special Committee.

<P>The Special Committee confronted a number of obstacles that hindered the progress of its investigation.  Among the most notable, certainly the most time-consuming, of these obstacles were (1) the withholding and delay in the production of documents directly relevant to the Committee's investigation and the noncooperation and resistance of a number of witnesses.

<P>Because the testimony of witnesses before the Special Committee was often contradictory as to important events and actions, the Special Committee placed particular emphasis on available documentary evidence.  Unfortunately, throughout the course of its inquiry, the Special Committee had been hindered by parties unduly delaying the production of, or withholding outright, documents critical to its investigation.

<P>The White House did not live up to its repeated promise to cooperate with the Special Committee's investigation into Whitewater, Madison Guaranty and related matters.  The White House and various individuals associated with the White House engaged in a pattern of activity designed to hinder the Special Committee's investigation.   

<P>The White House withheld documents from the Special Committee or produced highly relevant documents very late in the Committee's investigation.  For example, the White House failed to produce until January and February 1996 various notes taken by high level White House officials relating to the January 1994 Whitewater Response Team meetings.

<P>On January 29, 1996 the White House produced the notes of former White House Director of Communications Mark Gearan,(99) and claimed that the notes "were inadvertently moved to the Peace Corps with other personal effects in boxes."(100)  On February 13, 1996, the White House produced the documents from the files of Mr. Waldman, Special Assistant to the President that Mr. Waldman discovered these documents in his office in a file marked "WWDC", Whitewater Development Corporation, in the course of an office move.(101)  Then, on February 20, 1996 the Special Committee received memoranda from the White House which were prepared by Harold Ickes, White House Deputy Chief of Staff and the leader of the Whitewater Response Team meetings.  The White House represented that some were "mistakenly overlooked."(102)  Finally, on March 1, 1996, lawyers for Deputy White House Counsel Bruce Lindsey "which inadvertently were not produced" previously.(103)

<P>The White House withheld notes of the November 5, 1993 meeting of White House officials and the Clintons' private attorneys relating to Whitewater taken by Associate Counsel William Kennedy.  Although President Clinton had made numerous statements that he would not claim executive privilege for matters relating to Whitewater, the White House withheld these notes based on an assertion of "the attorney-client component of executive privilege."  On December 20, 1995, the full Senate adopted Senate Resolution 199, directing the Senate Legal Counsel to initiate a civil action in federal District Court under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1365 (1994).  On December 22, 1995, before the Senate Legal Counsel initiated such action, the White House reversed its position, and Mr. Kennedy produced his notes to the Special Committee.  The notes turned out to be highly relevant to the Special Committee's investigation.  They provided evidence that the White House Counsel's office and the Clintons' private attorneys had joined forces and clearly were working as agents of the private counsel in a joint and wholly improper  effort to serve the private interests of the Clintons.

13.<P>Senior Administration officials provided inaccurate and incomplete testimony to the Senate.

<P>The Special Committee concludes that senior Administration officials provided inaccurate and incomplete testimony to the Senate on a number of occasions.

<P>Most notably, Roger Altman, former Deputy Treasury Secretary and Acting CEO of the RTC, intentionally misled the Senate when he testified before the Banking Committee on February 24, 1994.  Mr. Altman was specifically asked about contacts with the White House and whether the RTC briefed the White House about the criminal referrals.  Mr. Altman's response was that there was only one substantive contact, and that it dealt with the procedure relating to the expiring statute of limitations.  As detailed in the Banking Committee's report on Treasury-White House contacts, he failed to mention his other communications with the White House.(104)

<P>In addition, as set forth in the discussion of Foster Phase of its inquiry, the Special Committee believes that other senior Administration officials provided inaccurate and incomplete testimony to the Senate.

<P>With respect to matters bearing upon the Washington Phase of the Committee's inquiry, the Special Committee believes that Deputy White House Chief of Staff Harold Ickes repeatedly provided inaccurate and incomplete testimony. 

<P>Mr. Ickes testified under oath to the Senate and to the Inspectors General of the Treasury Department and the RTC that he and other White House officials had no discussions about, or knowledge of, the statute of limitations for Madison-related civil claims prior to February 2, 1994.  In light of newly discovered evidence, the Special Committee believes that this testimony was inaccurate.

<P>In January 1994, considerable public interest existed in issues relating to Whitewater and Madison.  The statute of limitations for Madison-related civil claims involving fraud or intentional misconduct was scheduled to expire on February 28, 1994.  There was considerable congressional attention focused on the approaching expiration date.  Prior to enactment of the law extending the statute of limitations, however, the RTC had to decide by February 28, 1994, whether to bring suit, to seek tolling agreements, or to allow the statute to expire without action.  Because President and Mrs. Clinton faced potential liability relating to the failure of Madison, inside information regarding the status of the RTC investigation and its deliberations with respect to the statute of limitations was valuable to the White House and the Clintons in coordinating a defense strategy.

<P>During its 1994 investigation, counsel to the Banking Committee asked Mr. Ickes about his knowledge of issues surrounding the statute of limitations prior to its extension.(105)  Specifically, Mr. Ickes testified about a meeting on February 2, 1994, between senior White House officials and Roger Altman, then Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and Acting Chief Executive Officer of the RTC, and Jean Hanson, General Counsel to the Department of the Treasury.  With respect to discussions about the statute of limitations at that meeting, Mr. Ickes testified, "I, for one, had little knowledge, if any knowledge, about the situation,"(106)  and that "all this was new to me."(107)33  

<P>Evidence newly uncovered by the Special Committee, however, strongly suggests that these statements were untrue when Mr. Ickes made them under oath.  The evidence indicates that Mr. Ickes specifically assigned a subordinate to prepare, and later received, a memorandum on the statute of limitations for Madison-related civil claims and that he discussed the issue with other White House officials in January 1994, prior to the February 2 meeting with Mr. Altman and Ms. Hanson.

<P>On November 2, 1995, for example, the White House produced to the Special Committee a memorandum to Mr. Ickes from Associate Counsel to the President Neil Eggleston entitled "Statute of Limitations in Actions Brought by the Conservators of a Financial Institution."(108)  The memorandum, which was dated January 17, 1994, discussed the statute of limitations generally applicable to claims filed by the RTC on behalf of failed thrift institutions.  More important, Mr. Eggleston's memorandum discussed the statute of limitations as applied specifically to Madison and identified March 2, 1994, as the final date for the RTC to file civil tort claims on behalf of Madison, the type of action usually brought against outsiders in financial institution cases.(109)  

<P>Beyond this, the Special Committee believes that Mr. Ickes provided inaccurate testimony under oath about Mrs. Clinton's knowledge in 1994 of her potential liability to the RTC arising from her representation of Madison.  Mr. Ickes testified under oath to the Senate Banking Committee in July and August 1994 that he did not know whether two memoranda detailing the potential liability of the President and Mrs. Clinton to the RTC had been sent to Mrs. Clinton.  However, the Special Committee has discovered evidence indicating that, at about the same time of Mr. Ickes' testimony, his attorney transmitted information to the White House Counsel's Office that Mr. Ickes had specifically remembered sending the memoranda to Mrs. Clinton in response to repeated questions from the Clintons about their possible exposure in the RTC investigation.  The foregoing, to be sure, do not exhaust the instances in which the Committee believes that Mr. Ickes was less than candid, but it amply demonstrates that Mr. Ickes provided inaccurate and incomplete testimony to the Senate.

14.<P>The Office of the White House Counsel was frequently and improperly put in the service of the personal legal interests of the President and Mrs. Clinton.



<P>The Special Committee concludes that the use of the White House Counsel's Office to serve the private legal interests of the President and Mrs. Clinton was highly improper.  As government lawyers, the attorneys in the White House Counsel's Office have a duty to represent the public interest.  That duty is incompatible with the representation of any private parties -- even the President or First Lady.  Here, the interest of the United States with respect to these investigations in establishing civil and/or criminal liability was potentially adverse to the private interests of the Clintons in avoiding any such liability.

<P>The provision of legal services by government lawyers relating to the President's personal matters is contrary to the "Standards of Ethical Conduct" promulgated by the Office of Government Ethics ("OGE").  The Standards of Ethical Conduct, which were issued pursuant to Executive Order 12674 and apply to all Executive Branch employees, establish that it is a misuse of government position to make "[u]se of public office for private gain."(110)   More specifically, a government employee "shall not use his public office for his own private gain, . . . or for the private gain of friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity."(111)

<P>The underlying issues related to Whitewater and Madison arose prior to the inauguration of President Clinton.  The only Whitewater issues arising after the inauguration of the President involve the improper contacts between the White House and various other government agencies that were investigating Madison and Whitewater, including the Treasury Department, the RTC, and the SBA.  If such contacts had not taken place, there would be no investigation into events occurring after the President's inauguration.  The Office of the White House Counsel cannot bootstrap its improper handling of information about Whitewater and Madison into a justification for its participation in underlying Whitewater matters.

<P>When he was appointed Special Counsel to the President by President Clinton, Lloyd Cutler explained the proper sphere of the White House Counsel's representation of the President:  "When it comes to a President's private affairs, particularly private affairs that occurred before he took office, those should be handled by his own personal private counsel, and in my view not by the White House Counsel."(112)  

<P>The attempt of White House lawyers to obtain information and to communicate with witnesses is inconsistent with the need to maintain both the perceived or actual integrity of the ongoing federal investigations into Whitewater.  It is also contrary to the OGE's Standards of Ethical Conduct for a public employee to misuse nonpublic information.(113)  Finally, it contravenes a regulation promulgated by the Executive Office of the President, which provides:  "For the purpose of furthering a private interest, an employee shall not . . . directly or indirectly, use, or allow the use of, official information obtained through or in connection with his Government employment which has not been made available to the general public."(114)

<P>In sum, the Special Committee concludes that White House officials, in particular the Office of the White House Counsel, violated ethical standards and abused their official positions of public trust to assist in the Clintons' private legal defense effort.  The Special Committee recommends that steps be taken to prevent such future abuses.

   <H3>  CONCLUSIONS OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON THE

     DISCOVERY OF THE ROSE LAW FIRM BILLING RECORDS</H3>

     On January 5, 1996, the Special Committee received computer printouts of the Rose Law Firm's billings to Madison Guaranty.  These records were discovered under mysterious circumstances in the Book Room of the White House Residence. 

<P>The billing records constitute the best, and therefore most important, evidence concerning Mrs. Clinton's representation of Mr. McDougal's S&L in the mid-1980s--a relationship that was being investigated by at least three separate federal agencies. The records had been subject to several different federal subpoenas, besides that of the Special Committee, for nearly two years.  When federal investigators served their subpoenas, some more than two years ago, the billing records were nowhere to be found.  Despite extensive searches conducted by the Rose Law Firm, neither the originals nor copies were discovered.(115)  They were not in the firm's computers, its client files, or its storage facility.(116)

1.<P>The Rose billing records provide the best evidence of the legal services performed by Mrs. Clinton for Madison Guaranty.

<P>The billing records provide the best evidence of the legal services performed by Mrs. Clinton for Madison Guaranty and, as a result of the failed memories of many Rose Law Firm attorneys, are the only source of detailed information about the services that the Rose Law Firm provided to Madison Guaranty.  The computerized billing records are thus an invaluable asset in reconstructing Mrs. Clinton's actual involvement in the matter.  In total, Mrs. Clinton billed Madison Guaranty for 89 tasks, including 33 conferences with Madison Guaranty officials, on 53 separate days.(117)

<P>Among the significant facts established by the billing records are the following, the significance of which are discussed more fully in the Special Committee's conclusions regarding the Arkansas Phase of its investigation:

<P>*<P>Mrs. Clinton, and others on her behalf, repeatedly made statements that Richard Massey brought in Madison Guaranty as a client and, even though she was the billing partner on the matter, she was merely a "backstop" because the firm did not permit associates to bill clients directly.(118)  Mr. Massey, however, directly contradicted Mrs. Clinton's account in sworn testimony before the Special Committee.  The president of the S&L, John Latham, and a partner at the Rose law firm, David Knight, also contradicted Mrs. Clinton's account.

<P>The billing records substantially resolve this dispute in favor of the testimony of Messrs. Massey, Latham and Knight.

<P>*<P>During the 1992 campaign, allegations surfaced that Beverly Bassett Schaffer, who Governor Clinton appointed as Arkansas Securities Commissioner, gave preferential treatment to Madison Guaranty because of her relationship with the Governor and Mrs. Clinton.  The Clinton campaign denied that Mrs. Clinton attempted to influence Commissioner Bassett.  

<P>The billing records show that Mrs. Clinton called Ms. Schaffer the day before the Rose Law Firm submitted Madison's proposal for its preferred stock offering to the Arkansas Securities Department.(119)  The records reflect that Mrs. Clinton billed as much as one hour to the call.(120)  Ms. Schaffer notified Mrs. Clinton of the approval of the proposal two weeks later in a letter addressed, "Dear Hillary."(121)

<P>In testimony before the Special Committee, former Commissioner Schaffer directly contradicted Mrs. Clinton and stated that the proposal was discussed during the telephone call.  Mr. Massey similarly disputed Mrs. Clinton's account for the telephone call to Ms. Schaffer.(122)

<P>*<P>Mrs. Clinton has minimized her role in the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison before the Arkansas Securities Department in connection with Madison's proposed stock offering.  The billing records and Mr. Massey's testimony directly contradict Mrs. Clinton's claim that her role on the matter was merely to serve as a "backstop."  

<P>The billing records show that Mrs. Clinton billed Madison for a total of approximately 60 hours of work.  Mrs. Clinton billed 6.2 hours on the preferred stock deal for conferences alone that she had with Mr. McDougal, with Mr. Latham and Davis Fitzhugh, two other Madison S&L officers involved in the stock offering.(123)  

<P>Mrs. Clinton had at least six conferences with Mr. Massey, the young Rose Law Firm attorney responsible for performing the associate type tasks on the matter.(124)  Mrs. Clinton also reviewed the amendments to the application submitted to the Arkansas Securities Department.(125)  Mr. Massey testified that he did his work under the supervision of Mrs. Clinton.(126)  According to Mr. Massey: "Mrs. Clinton was the billing attorney and had a relationship with me such that she needed to know what I was doing so she could be prepared to update the client at any time."(127)  When asked whether Mrs. Clinton's work on the stock proposal deal was "minimal," Mr. Massey responded, "In my own mind it's a significant amount of time."(128)

<P>*<P>The billing records indicate that Mrs. Clinton's involvement in Castle Grande was much more extensive than she has thus far owned up to.  Before the billing records were discovered, little was known about the nature of the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison Guaranty in connection with the Castle Grande land transaction.  Perhaps because Mrs. Clinton had ordered the destruction of Madison-related records in 1988, the Rose Law Firm no longer possessed any file related to the Castle Grande deal.

<P>Federal investigators described the Castle Grande transactions as a series of land flips and transactions that cost the American taxpayers $4 million.(129)  In 1995, when the RTC asked about her knowledge of Castle Grande, Mrs. Clinton stated "I do not believe I knew anything about any of these real estate parcels and projects." (130)

<P>The billing records identify Mrs. Clinton as the billing partner on the matter--even though Mrs. Clinton claimed that she has no idea how the Rose Law Firm became involved in the matter.(131)  These records indicate that Mrs. Clinton billed more time on the Castle Grande matter--29.5 hours, or 54 percent of total billings on the matter--than any other lawyer at the Rose Law Firm.  Indeed, nearly half of Mrs. Clinton's total billings to Madison were for work on Castle Grande.  In the months following the initial transaction, Mrs. Clinton had at least 12 conferences with Mr. Ward and numerous meetings with Madison officials in connection with the subsequent sales that she billed to the IDC/Castle Grande matter.

<P>*<P>More important, the billing records were perhaps most illuminating with respect to the nature of Mrs. Clinton's work on Castle Grande.  For his role as the "straw man" and other related services to the project, Mr. Ward was owed a commission.  On March 31, 1986, Madison Guaranty loaned Mr. Ward $400,000.(132)  One week later, on April 7, 1986, Madison Financial executed two promissory notes, for $300,000 and $70,943, purporting to reflect loans from Mr. Ward to Madison Financial Corporation, Madison Guaranty's subsidiary service corporation.(133)  At about this time, bank examiners were scrutinizing Madison Guaranty's books.  Mr. James Clark, the chief examiner, asked whether the three notes were related.(134)  He was assured by a Madison Guaranty official, probably Don Denton, that the notes were not related.(135)  In fact, according to Madison official John Latham, the three notes were related, and the $400,000 March 31 loan from Madison Guaranty was intended to pay Mr. Ward's commissions.(136)

<P>The Rose Law Firm billing records revealed that on April 7, 1986, the day the Madison Financial notes were executed, Mrs. Clinton billed 12 minutes to the IDC/Castle Grande matter for "Telephone conference with Don Denton."(137)  A message slip produced by Mr. Denton reflects that Mrs. Clinton called him from the Rose Law Firm on April 7, 1986.(138) On a June 11, 1996 interview with FDIC investigators, Mr. Denton stated that Mrs. Clinton called seeking copies of the notes between Mr. Ward, Madison Financial, and Madison Guaranty.(139)  Mr. Denton told investigators that during the conversation he cautioned Mrs. Clinton that a problem might exist with respect to the April 7 notes to Mr. Ward because "they constituted in effect a parent entity fulfilling the obligation of a subsidiary,"(140) a violation of the so-called direct investment rule.  Mrs. Clinton, however, "summarily dismissed" that concern in a way that he took to mean that "he would take care of savings and loan matters, and she would take care of legal matters."(141)

<P>And she did.  The billing records showed that on May 1, 1986, Mrs. Clinton billed Madison Guaranty for two hours of time for the following work: "Conference with Seth Ward; telephone conference with Seth Ward regarding option; telephone conference with Mike Shauffler; prepare option."(142)  Indeed, a May 1 option agreement between Mr. Ward and Madison Financial bore a word processing code ("0190g") that, according to the Rose Law Firm's counsel, indicates the document was created at the Rose Law Firm by or for Mrs. Clinton.(143)  

<P>Mr. Clark, the bank examiner told investigators that, after reviewing the records and in light of Mr. Denton' testimony, he believed that the May 1 option prepared by Mrs. Clinton "was created `in order to conceal the connection--whatever it was--between'" the March 31 and April 7 notes.(144)

<P>On June 13, 1996, the Special Committee requested that the First Lady attempt to refresh her recollection regarding the matters discussed by Mr. Denton and to inform the Committee of what she recalls about them.(145)  On June 17, 1996 the Special Committee received an affidavit from Mrs. Clinton accompanied by a letter from Mr. Kendall.  In the affidavit, Mrs. Clinton gave no answer to the question posed by the Special Committee; instead, she simply referred to Mr. Kendall's letter "addressing certain allegations recently made by Mr. Don Denton."(146)  In his letter, Mr. Kendall maintained that Mr. Denton's recollection is "wholly unreliable"34  but gave no indication as to the recollection of the First Lady.(147)  The First Lady therefore has neither confirmed nor denied Mr. Denton's testimony.  

<P>The significance of the billing records as they relate to Castle Grande is perhaps best illustrated by the activities of Mrs. Clinton's legal defense team immediately after the discovery of the records.  A message slip from John Tisdale, the Clintons' Arkansas lawyer to Alston Jennings, Seth Ward's former attorney on Castle Grande, indicate that, on June 5, 1996, the day after Ms. Huber discovered the records in her White House office, Mr. Kendall called Mr. Tisdale and Mr. Jennings to arrange a meeting.(148)  One week after the records were discovered, on January 11, 1996, Mr. Kendall flew to Little Rock and met first with Mr. Jennings and then with Mr. Ward.(149)  The meeting with Mr. Ward lasted 30-40 minutes.(150)  Curiously, Mr. Kendall had also contacted Mr. Jennings in August 1995.  Subsequent to that contact, Mrs. Clinton summoned Mr. Jennings to the White House for a personal meeting on August 10, 1995, around the time that the billing records were placed in the Book Room of the White House residence.

2.<P>The disappearance and mysterious reappearance of the Rose Law Firm billing records was part of a larger pattern of removal, concealment and, at times, destruction of records concerning Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison.

<P>The mysterious discovery of the Rose billing records must be viewed in the context of the destruction and mishandling of other Rose Law Firm files concerning Madison between 1988 and 1992.  In 1988, Mrs. Clinton ordered the Rose Law Firm to destroy records relating to her representation of Mr. McDougal's Madison S&L.(151)  As described above, this was not a routine destruction of records because there was pending litigation relating to Castle Grande and federal regulators were investigating the operation and solvency of Madison in anticipation of taking over the troubled S&L. 

<P>The mishandling of Madison documents continued after the 1992 presidential campaign, when the firm's files on Madison, which were by now the property of the RTC as conservator of Madison, and files of other Rose clients for whom Mrs. Clinton had performed legal services, were secretly removed from the firm by another then-Rose Law Firm partner, Webster Hubbell.  Mr. Hubbell removed these files, at times taking the firm's only copies,(152) without obtaining the consent of the firm or the client.(153)

3.<P>Vincent Foster is the last person known to have the billing records in his possession.

<P>During the 1992 presidential campaign, on February 12, 1992, an unknown person printed out a set of the Rose Law Firm's computerized records of billings to Madison Guaranty.(154)  Mr. Hubbell asserted that either he or former Deputy White House Counsel Vincent Foster, also a Rose partner, directed the Rose accounting department to print the billing records for Madison.(155)  In addition to obtaining the computerized billing records, Mr. Hubbell also retrieved other files and documents relating to Mrs. Clinton's work for Madison.

<P>According to Mr. Hubbell, Mr. Foster was the last person he saw handling the billing records.(156)  Mr. Hubbell did not know who removed the records from the Rose Law Firm,(157) or how they came to be left in the White House Residence.(158)  He claimed not to have spoken with anyone about the billing records since the 1992 presidential campaign.(159)

4.<P>The billing records mysteriously reappear in the Book Room of the White House Residence in August 1995.

<P>During the first two weeks of August 1995, Carolyn Huber, Special Assistant to the President and Special Director of Correspondence for the White House, saw the Rose Law Firm billing records for the first time.(160)  The billing records were in the Book Room, a small room on the third floor of the First Family's private quarters in the White House Residence.(161)

<P>In early August 1995, Ms. Huber was gathering newspaper and magazine clippings in the Book Room when she noticed the records in clear view on the edge of a table.(162)  The records were folded in half, and Ms. Huber recognized the records, from her experience at the Rose Law Firm, to be billing records.(163)

<P>For several months, Ms. Huber gave little thought to the records, which were moved in a box to her office.  On the morning of January 4, 1996, Ms. Huber discovered the records when the table was removed that had concealed the box with the billing records for five months.(164)

<P>Immediately, Ms. Huber realized the billing records were related to Madison Guaranty.(165)  She was horrified because she understood their significance; she had seen several subpoenas calling for the production of Madison Guaranty records, including these very records.(166)

5.<P>Only a limited number of people had access to Book Room of the White House Residence.

<P>The Special Committee's inquiry discovered that only a limited number of people had access to the Book Room, and no one admitted to placing the billing records in the Book Room of the White House Residence.  Only a limited number of people had access.  Moreover, it is highly unlikely that those with access would be leaving or disturbing documents in that private area of the White House.

<P>  The Special Committee rejects as fanciful the suggestion that construction workers or residence staff were somehow responsible for leaving the records in the Book Room.  Similarly, the denials by overnight guests are highly credible because none of them would have been likely to be carrying records into the Book Room or to disturb materials in the Book Room.

<P>Accordingly, the Special Committee concludes that most persons with access to the Book Room during the relevant period truthfully denied leaving the Rose billing records in the Book Room.  They had neither the opportunity to possess the billing records nor the motive to conceal them from investigators for nearly two years.

6.<P>Very few people had motive to be handling or reading the Rose billing records in August 1995.

<P>Few lay people would have understood the significance or content of the Rose billing records in August 1995.  In fact, based on the evidence received by the Special Committee, only three people had previously shown an interest in and handled the billing records -- Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Foster and Mr. Hubbell.  Of these, Mr. Foster passed away on July 20, 1993, and Mr. Hubbell reported to federal prison on August 7, 1995.(167)

<P>Moreover, as discussed earlier in these Conclusions, the principal relevance of the billing records was to disclose the nature and extent of the legal work performed by Rose Law Firm partners for Madison Guaranty.  As noted above, these records were particularly significant in evaluating work done by Mrs. Clinton.  Again, this is an important factor in evaluating who would have had an interest in reviewing the records in August 1995.  Finally, the Committee is impressed by the fact that these records appeared on the table of the Book Room within days after the RTC-IG issued its report critical of the Rose Law Firm and its conflict of interest over Madison.  As evidenced by the memorandum of March 1, 1994 from Mr. Ickes to Mrs. Clinton, this particular issue was of concern to Mrs. Clinton in connection with her possible exposure to personal liability.

7.<P>Only a limited number of people were definitely within the chain of custody of the billing records.<P>

<P>Although the absence of fingerprints does not rule out that a person handled documents, the presence of fingerprints positively establishes that someone was in the chain of custody.  Of individuals positively within the chain of custody on these documents, only Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Foster are likely to have been interested in reading the billing records.  Indeed, in an affidavit submitted to the Special Committee on June 17, 1996, Mrs. Clinton stated:  "I recall discussing some of this legal work in 1992 with Mr. Vincent Foster and Mr. Webster Hubbell, as I sought to answer press questions about the Madison Guaranty representation during the Presidential Campaign.  Prior to the recent release of FBI fingerprint information, I had stated that I might have been shown billing records in 1992."(168)

8.<P>Mrs. Clinton is more likely than any other known individual to have placed the billing records in the Book Room in August 1995.

<P>The Special Committee is mindful that the question of possession of the long lost and much sought Rose billing records has grave legal implications.  Not surprisingly, no one has admitted to putting the documents in the Book Room.  On the current state of the record, the Special Committee cannot state with certainty who put the records in the Book Room.

<P>Nevertheless, the pattern of past behavior in handling documents, the limited number of persons with access to the Book Room, the question of motive, and the chain of custody evidence, taken together, suggest that very few people were likely to have placed the Rose billing records in the Book Room in August 1995.  With these factors in mind, the Special Committee concludes that Mrs. Clinton is more likely than any other known individual to have placed the records in the Book Room.  Certainly, Mrs. Clinton fits the above criteria most closely.35

<P><P><P><P>    <H2>  BACKGROUND</H2>

I.<P>Whitewater Development Corporation and Madison Guaranty S&L

<P>In August 1978, the Clintons and the McDougals purchased 230 acres of land in Marion County, Arkansas for $202,000 with the intention of dividing the land into lots and selling them for a profit.(169)  At the time, Mr. Clinton was the Attorney General of Arkansas, and Mrs. Clinton was a young associate with the Rose Law Firm of Little Rock.(170)  In June 1979, the Clintons and the McDougals formed Whitewater Development Corporation and subsequently transferred the land to the company.(171)  

<P>In October 1980, the year after Whitewater was formed, Mr. McDougal and others purchased a controlling interest in the Bank of Kingston, a small commercial bank located in Kingston, Arkansas,(172) and changed its name to Madison Bank and Trust.(173)  In January 1982, the McDougals purchased an interest in Woodruff County Savings and Loan, which they renamed Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association.(174)  Madison Guaranty thereafter formed a service corporation, Madison Financial Corporation, to facilitate Madison Guaranty's investment in real estate development projects.(175)  In November 1983, the McDougals obtained a controlling interest in Madison Guaranty.(176)

<P>Madison Guaranty's financial condition was poor when the McDougals purchased it and only became worse in later years.  In January 1984, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board ("FHLBB") commenced a special examination of Madison Guaranty that culminated in a supervisory agreement to which Madison's Board of Directors consented in July 1984.(177)  In October 1984, Mr. and Mrs. McDougal resigned as directors and officers of Madison Guaranty, but Mr. McDougal remained as Chairman and President of Madison Financial.(178)  Mr. McDougal, however, retained control of Madison Guaranty and maintained his office there.(179)

<P>In March 1986, the FHLBB began another examination of Madison Guaranty which revealed that the thrift's problems had grown worse.(180)  At a meeting in Dallas, Texas on July 11, 1986, the FHLBB instructed Madison Guaranty's Board of Directors to remove John Latham, the Chairman of Madison Guaranty, and Mr. McDougal from their positions at Madison Financial.(181)  The next month, the FHLBB entered a cease and desist order against the S&L.(182)  The FHLBB took over Madison Guaranty in February 1989 and, in November of that year, the RTC was appointed receiver.(183) 

<P>The failure of Madison Guaranty cost American taxpayers in excess of $60 million.  While Mr. McDougal was running Madison Guaranty between 1982-86, the Clintons made no payments toward the Whitewater debt.(184) 

<P>In 1992, the RTC began to investigate improper activities at Madison Guaranty and, on September 1, 1992, sent a criminal referral to the U.S. Attorney's office highlighting possible criminal violations.  The referral described "numerous questionable cash flow and 'loan' transactions" between Madison and a dozen companies owned or controlled by the McDougals, including Whitewater.(185)  The referral named, among others, the Clintons and future Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker as persons who stood to benefit from, and as potential witnesses to, the suspected criminal activity.(186)

<P>The Clintons, in a pattern that would recur, received advance notice of the confidential RTC referral.  In late fall 1992, Betsey Wright, former chief of staff to Governor Clinton, learned of a "criminal referral regarding a savings and loan official in Arkansas and . . . involv[ing] the Clintons"(187) which had been sent "to the prosecutor in Little Rock."(188)  Upon learning the news, Ms. Wright told Mrs. Clinton about the referral.(189) It is with this knowledge of the confidential referral that the Clintons and their advisors came to Washington.

<P>By March 1993, senior Clinton Administration officials confirmed that the RTC had sent a criminal referral mentioning the Clintons to the Justice Department.(190)  Specifically, RTC Senior Vice President William H. Roelle, on or about March 23, 1993, told Roger Altman, then Deputy Treasury Secretary, of the RTC referral involving the Clintons.(191)  Mr. Altman immediately passed this important information on to White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum.  On March 23, Mr. Altman sent Mr. Nussbaum a facsimile with a handwritten cover sheet, forwarding an "RTC Clip Sheet" of a March 9, 1992 New York Times article with the headline, "Clinton Defends Real-Estate Deal."(192)  The next day, Mr. Altman faxed to Mr. Nussbaum the same article and another Times report on Whitewater, dated March 8, 1992, entitled "Clintons Joined S&L Operator in an Ozark Real-Estate Venture."(193)  The link thus had been made been between the RTC criminal referral and the Clintons' investment in Whitewater and their relationship with Mr. McDougal.  This knowledge of the link between Whitewater and possible criminal investigations provides the subtext for a pattern of misconduct in the White House and elsewhere in the Clinton administration in an effort to contain potential damage from Whitewater and Madison.

II.<P>Capital Management Services and David Hale

<P>Whitewater was not the Clintons' only link to criminal investigations.  In September 1978, David Hale, a former prosecutor and municipal court judge, formed Capital Management Services Inc., ("CMS").(194)  In March 1979, the SBA licensed CMS as a Specialized Small Business Investment Company ("SSBIC").(195)  On September 15, 1993, the SBA placed CMS into receivership after "the company's accumulated losses exceeded its private capital by 171 percent."(196)

<P>A SSBIC is a company that the SBA licenses to lend money to disadvantaged small businesses.(197)  SSBICs may not provide assistance to businesses that are not at least 50 percent owned, controlled, and managed by "disadvantaged individuals."(198)  To ensure that SSBICs comply with these requirements, the SBA requires firms to document that they qualify for SBA assistance.(199)  

<P>Mr. Hale and his associates perpetrated a fraud on the SBA by using CMS to make loans to political insiders rather than "disadvantaged" individuals.(200)  After the SBA would advance federal funds to CMS, Mr. Hale and his business associates would falsify loan applications in order to receive funds for their personal needs.(201)  Mr. McDougal and Jim Guy Tucker were among associates of Mr. Hale who participated in and benefitted from this fraud.(202)<P>

<P>On April 3, 1986, Mr. Hale loaned $300,000 to Susan McDougal for the stated purpose of capitalizing Mrs. McDougal's new advertising firm, Master Marketing.(203)  

<P>  Wayne Foren, then Associate Administrator for Investment at the SBA and the program director for the SSBIC program, learned of the $300,000 loan.(204)  Mr. Foren also learned that some of the proceeds of the loan to Mrs. McDougal's Master Marketing benefitted Whitewater.(205)  Mr. Foren stated that records suggest that of the original $300,000 loan, $111,500 was diverted to make payments on the Flowerwood Farms account and another $25,000 was used to replace money, either directly or indirectly, that went into Whitewater.(206)  

<P>At the McDougal and Tucker trial, Mr. Hale testified that he made these loans to Mr. McDougal as a favor to then-Governor Clinton and Mr. McDougal.(207)  After Mr. Hale's allegations implicating the President became public in September 1993, this $300,000 loan quickly became the center of the controversy surrounding CMS and its connections to Mr. McDougal and Whitewater.  Although the accounts of Mr. McDougal and Mr. Hale differ regarding why the loan was made and the use of the proceeds, records clearly indicate that the money was used for purposes other than those stated on the loan application filed with the SBA.(208)  Mr. Hale's allegations concerning President Clinton have been refuted by Mr. McDougal's version of the events and President Clinton's own testimony at Mr. McDougal's trial, but neither has been verified by any outside source.(209)  

<P>Mr. Foren testified that he became concerned about CMS when Mr. Hale attempted to obtain matching government funds for what Mr. Hale claimed was an increase in his capital resulting from a gift.(210)   Mr. Hale told Mr. Foren that people would give him money for his SSBIC because they knew he had ties to Jim Guy Tucker and then-Governor Clinton.(211)  These statements aroused Mr. Foren's suspicion and, after a discussion with Mr. Hale, he sent a referral to investigate Mr. Hale's SSBIC to the Inspector General's office.(212) 

<P>In early 1993, the SBA began an internal inquiry into Mr. Hale and questionable activities at CMS, an inquiry which touched upon Mr. Hale's relationship with the Clintons.(213)  Again, by the time the inquiry ripened into a referral for further investigative action, the White House received word.  SBA Associate Administrator Wayne Foren testified that, in early May 1993, he briefed Erskine Bowles, the new SBA Administrator, about the agency's investigation of Mr. Hale and CMS because the case involved President Clinton.(214)  Shortly thereafter, Mr. Bowles told Mr. Foren that he had briefed White House Chief of Staff Thomas ("Mack") McLarty about the case.(215)

<P>On March 22, 1994, Mr. Hale pleaded guilty to two felony counts in connection to the granting of illegal loans.(216)  In 1996, James McDougal, Susan McDougal, and Governor Jim Guy Tucker were indicted on charges stemming from dealings associated with Madison Guaranty and Capital Management Services.(217)  On May 28, 1996 all three were convicted;  Mr. and Mrs.  McDougal were both convicted of eight charges directly related to the illegal $300,000 loan from Mr. Hale.(218)

 <H2>   SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE

     PART I: THE HANDLING OF FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS</H2>

     

     

I. Mrs. Clinton Learns of the RTC Criminal Referral on Madison Guaranty.

<P>Before its charter expired at the end of 1995, the RTC was charged with investigating the cause of the failure of savings and loans under its control and to determine what civil claims, if any, should be pursued.  The RTC, however, lacked the authority to initiate criminal prosecution of the failed S&Ls.  Thus, it was the RTC's practice to notify the Justice Department -- typically, the U.S. Attorney's office and the FBI Bureau for the jurisdiction in which the failed thrift was located -- of any suspected crimes discovered by the agency.  A "criminal referral" is the formal document that the RTC and other federal agencies use to report suspected criminal activity to the Justice Department.(219)    

<P>In 1992 and 1993, RTC investigators in Kansas City submitted to the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas ten criminal referrals concerning the activities of Madison Guaranty.  Several of the referrals identified Mr. and Mrs. McDougal, the Clintons' Whitewater partners, and Mr. Tucker, who succeeded Mr. Clinton as Governor of Arkansas, as targets.  Two of the referrals specifically involved Whitewater Development Corporation, which maintained a checking account at Madison Guaranty.  One of the referrals alleged that Madison Guaranty funds were used to make illegal contributions to then-Governor Clinton's gubernatorial campaigns in the mid-1980s.  Finally, the Clintons were named in three of the referrals as possible witnesses to suspected criminal activities. 

<P>A.<P>The RTC begins its criminal investigation of Madison Guaranty. 

<P>The RTC began its investigation of criminal activities related to Madison Guaranty after the publication of an article on the front page of the New York Times on March 8, 1992.(220)  The article, written by investigative reporter Jeff Gerth, reported that Governor Clinton, then a leading Democratic candidate for president, and his wife were partners with Mr. McDougal in the Whitewater real estate venture.<P>  

<P>Mr. Gerth's article caused several RTC officials to question whether Whitewater had caused any of the financial losses suffered by the failed Madison Guaranty S&L.  Mr. Gerth had written that "at times money from Mr. McDougal's savings and loan was used to subsidize" Whitewater.  Mr. Gerth also wrote:



<P><P>"It was during the period that Whitewater was making the Clintons' loan payments that Madison Guaranty was putting money into Whitewater.



<P><P>For example, Whitewater's check ledger shows that Whitewater's account at Madison was overdrawn in 1984, when the corporation was making payments on the Clintons' loan.  Money was deposited to make up the shortage from Madison Marketing, an affiliate of the savings and loan that derived its revenue from the institution, records also show."(221)

    

<P>After publication of the article, the criminal investigations unit in the RTC's office in Tulsa, Oklahoma -- the office responsible for investigating possible crimes involving failed savings and loans in Arkansas -- received requests to investigate Madison Guaranty and Whitewater from both the Office of Investigations in the RTC Washington, D.C. office and from the director of the Tulsa office.(222)  In any event, a criminal examination of Madison Guaranty had already been slated to commence in December, 1992.(223) 

<P>In March 1992, Mike Van Valkenberg, the head of investigations in the Tulsa office, assigned Laura Jean Lewis to be the lead RTC criminal investigator on the case.(224)  At the time, Ms. Lewis was the RTC's only criminal investigator with responsibility for savings and loans in Arkansas.(225)

<P>From March through August 1992, Ms. Lewis examined Madison Guaranty records stored in a warehouse in Little Rock.(226)  She retraced and analyzed the flow of funds between several checking accounts at Madison Guaranty, including the Whitewater account, the McDougals' personal account, and the accounts of several other McDougal-related companies.(227)  

<P>Ms. Lewis testified that the investigation uncovered "substantial evidence of bank fraud."(228)  Specifically, Ms. Lewis found numerous instances in which the McDougals would write a check on the Madison Guaranty account of one their various enterprises with insufficient funds to satisfy the draft and then deposit another check in that account, also written on insufficient funds, from another Madison Guaranty account.(229)  Ms. Lewis observed that although many of checks had the word "loan" written on them, they were written on accounts lacking sufficient funds.(230)  Ms. Lewis testified that through this "elaborate check kiting scheme" the McDougals "float[ed] worthless checks among specific accounts [so as] to create the appearance of legitimate balances."(231) 

<P>B.<P>The first RTC criminal referral: C0004.

<P>In July 1992, the investigation was interrupted briefly when the RTC office in Tulsa was closed and its investigations unit merged with the Kansas City office.(232)  Ms. Lewis accepted an offer to transfer to the Kansas City office.(233)

<P>By early August 1992, Ms. Lewis had begun to draft a criminal referral based upon her investigation of Madison Guaranty.(234)  On August 31, 1992, the referral was completed and assigned the number C0004.(235)  The referral was signed by Ms. Lewis, and her two immediate supervisors in the Kansas City office:  Lee O. Ausen, the head of the Criminal Investigations Department, and L. Richard Iorio, the Director of Investigations.(236) 

<P>On September 1, 1992, Mr. Iorio sent Criminal Referral C0004 to Charles Banks, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas,(237) and to Steven Irons, Supervisory Special Agent ("SSA") of the FBI Little Rock Field Office.(238).  In the accompanying transmittal letter to Mr. Banks, Mr. Iorio wrote that "[c]ertain matters have come to our attention which may constitute criminal offenses under Federal law.  Enclosed is a report of Apparent Criminal Irregularity."(239)  The referral was accompanied by several hundred pages of documentary exhibits consisting of copies of checks, account statements, and other bank records.  

<P>Prior to its submission to the Justice Department, Criminal Referral C0004 was reviewed not only by Mr. Iorio and Mr. Ausen, but also by James Thompson, the Deputy Regional Director of the RTC's Kansas City office.(240)  James Dudine, the Director of the Office of Investigations in the RTC's Washington, D.C. office, also reviewed the referral after it was submitted to the Justice Department.(241)  Both Thompson and Dudine testified that they thought C0004 met the standard for issuance of a criminal referral -- i.e., that there was a reasonable basis for believing that a crime has been committed or attempted.(242)  Mr. Iorio, who signed the referral, testified that he thought the referral met and exceeded the prescribed standard.(243) 

<P>Criminal Referral C0004 was a 20-page, single-spaced description of "numerous questionable cash flow and 'loan' transactions" occurring in 1984 and 1985 among a dozen companies controlled by the McDougals, including Whitewater Development Corporation.(244)  The referral alleged that crimes may have been committed in the course of these transactions; that some of the McDougal's business associates may have been aware of the criminal activity; and that the suspected criminal activity may have cumulatively contributed to the failure of Madison Guaranty:

<P>The transactions reviewed and discussed herein will allege excessive overdrafts resulting in unauthorized loans, check kiting, possible forgery (or at the very least, extensive use of unauthorized signatures), potential misappropriation of funds, possible illicit campaign contributions, diversion of loan proceeds, and potential bank fraud; each of these actions, compounded by the extended time frame during which they occurred, lends [credence] to the probability that some or all of the McDougal's business associates and partners, the collective principals of these combined companies, had knowledge of these activities.  The extensive nature of these activities could allegedly constitute ongoing criminal and regulatory violations which lasted for a period of three or more years, and could have ultimately contributed to the failure of the Association.(245)



<P>The referral alleged that the McDougals and Lisa Aunspaugh (an employee of Susan McDougal's), had committed, among other crimes, bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1344, and conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 371.(246)  The referral named the President and Mrs. Clinton, Governor Jim Guy Tucker, former U.S. Senator J.W. Fulbright, Stephen Smith, and Greg Young, as potential witnesses to suspected criminal activity.(247)  The referral also identified the Clintons, Mr. Tucker, and Mr. Smith as persons who had stood to benefit from the suspected criminal activity.(248)

<P>Ms. Lewis identified the Clintons as possible witnesses because they "were business associates and involved in the Whitewater Corporation with Mr. McDougal, and as such, I think I would have been imprudent in my job had I not listed them as witnesses because they were part of Whitewater and could have easily had knowledge of what Mr. McDougal was doing with those funds."(249)  Mr. Iorio agreed with Ms. Lewis' decision to list the Clintons as possible witnesses.(250)    

<P>The referral indicated that, during the mid-1980s, at least 10 checks were written on the Whitewater's account at Madison Guarantyand that five of the checks totalling over $60,000 were written on insufficient funds.(251)  The referral also noted that these overdrafts were cured by funds supplied by other McDougal entities, and that Madison Guaranty did not impose any service charges or fees in connection with the overdrafts.(252)

<P>C.<P>Betsey Wright informs Mrs. Clinton of the RTC criminal referral.

<P>At about the time when Ms. Lewis was preparing Criminal Referral C0004, Mrs. Clinton learned of its existence.  Betsey Wright, the former Chief of Staff to Governor Clinton, testified that in the fall of 1992, while she was working on the Clinton presidential campaign, she was informed, from a person she could not remember, of an RTC Criminal "Referral about an S&L officer which would implicate the Clintons in Arkansas."(253)  Ms. Wright testified that "she went scrambling trying to find out what on earth they were talking about."(254)  Ms. Wright called Bob Wilson, a criminal defense attorney in Little Rock, to determine whether she could obtain information about the referral but was told that such information would be confidential.(255)

<P>Ms. Wright testified that she spoke with Mrs. Clinton and asked "if she was aware of any friend of theirs in the savings and loan business who might be under criminal investigation, and we couldn't think of anybody."(256)  Although national media attention was focused on the McDougals, Madison Guaranty, and Whitewater during the 1992 campaign, Ms. Wright claimed that Mr. McDougal's name was not discussed during her conversation with Mrs. Clinton.(257)

<P>

II. Criminal Referral C0004 Languishes at the Justice Department<P>

<P>After a criminal referral is submitted to the U.S. Attorney, he or she must determine whether it warrants further investigation or the initiation of criminal proceedings.(258)  When the U.S. Attorney declines to proceed with a criminal referral, a "declination letter" is sent to the RTC.(259)  

<P>Although RTC Criminal Referral C0004 was submitted to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Little Rock on September 1, 1992,(260) no action was taken on the referral for more than one year.  Finally, in October 1993, the new U.S Attorney in Little Rock, Paula Casey, a former student and campaign worker for President Clinton, declined this referral.(261)  The referral was also reviewed by Justice Department officials in Washington, D.C., where the President's close friend, Webster Hubbell, was the Associate Attorney General, the third-highest position in the Justice Department.

<P>A.<P>The U.S. Attorney sends Criminal Referral C0004 to the main Justice Department. 



<P>On September 2, 1992, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Little Rock received Criminal Referral C0004.(262)  The U.S. Attorney's Manual directs that a U.S. Attorney send an "Urgent Memorandum" to the attention of the Attorney General whenever a sensitive matter arises.(263)  Although Criminal Referral C0004 identified Governor Clinton, then the Democratic nominee for President, his wife, and Jim Guy Tucker, then the Lieutenant Governor, as potential witnesses, Mr. Banks did not send an "Urgent Memorandum" or even report the receipt of the referral to the Justice Department in Washington, D.C. ("Main Justice").(264)  Mr. Banks claimed that he did not notify Main Justice of the referral immediately because he lacked "confidence" in the referral and wanted more evidence before notifying persons outside of Little Rock.(265)

<P>At about the same time, on September 17, 1992, White House Cabinet Secretary Edie Holliday asked Attorney General William Barr whether he was aware of any matter involving one of the presidential candidates.(266)  Ms. Holiday later told Mr. Barr that the matter she had heard about involved a failed savings and loan and the Clintons.  Mr. Barr asked Ira Raphaelson, then-Special Counsel for Financial Institutions Crimes(267), to ascertain whether the Justice Department was handling such an investigation.(268)  Mr. Raphaelson initially informed the Attorney General that no such case existed within the Department.(269) 

<P>After Mr. Barr made a second request, however, Mr. Raphaelson discovered that "there had been a referral down in Arkansas, but it had not been reported.  In fact, it appeared that the office had withheld it from [Justice Department] headquarters."(270)  Mr. Barr testified that he was angry that the U.S. Attorney's Office in Little Rock had deliberately failed to inform him of the matter:

<P>I basically said I was very angry that a matter which I viewed as a sensitive matter, that should have been reported to the Attorney General, was deliberately withheld from the Attorney General.  So I was angry, and expressed my displeasure, and said that I'd be interested in knowing why an urgent report was not prepared for me and why I was not advised of this case, and why it had been deliberately withheld.(271)

<P> 

<P>Mr. Barr testified that Criminal Referral C0004 definitely met the criteria for the issuance of an Urgent Report:

<P>The criteria is really anything which involves -- well, includes anything that involves a public personage, a celebrity or any kind of sensitive case that can involve, for example, public officials in the state, those kinds of things.  It's inconceivable to me that any U.S. Attorney would not immediately understand that this case would require an Urgent Report.(272)

<P><P>    

Mr. Barr instructed Mr. Raphaelson to ensure that the matter was kept in the strictest confidence to prevent any leaks and was handled solely based on its merits.(273)<P>    

<P>On October 7, 1992, Floyd Mac Dodson, First Assistant to Mr. Banks, informed Lawrence McWhorter, Director of the Executive Office of United States Attorneys, that the U.S. Attorney's Office had been "sitting on the referral for six weeks," and that he "thought some further investigation was needed."(274)  The next day, Mr. McWhorter transmitted an Urgent Memorandum, along with a copy of Criminal Referral C0004, to Attorney General Barr, stating that "[i]t is the belief of the U.S. Attorney's Office that further investigation into this matter is warranted."(275)

<P>On the same day, SSA Irons also sent a teletype to SSA Kevin Kendrick at FBI headquarters in Washington informing him about Crminal Referral C0004.(276)  The FBI teletype listed then-Governor and Mrs. Clinton and then-Lieutenant Governor Jim Guy Tucker among the possible witnesses.(277)  The teletype explained the reason for identifying the Clintons as potential witnesses:

<P>The activities of McDougal as they may have involved Bill or Hillary Clinton are related to Whitewater Development Corporation, Inc.  (WWD)  James and Susan McDougal and Bill and Hillary Clinton were partners in WWD. . . [Pages of the referral]  discuss the check kiting activity involving the WWD account at MGSL.(278)

 

According to the teletype, Mr. Banks had informed the FBI that he intended to research the referral and analyze the 300 documentary exhibits submitted by the RTC.(279)<P><P><P> On October 8, 1992, officials from FBI Headquarters and Main Justice met to discuss Crminal Referral C0004.(280)  Present at the meeting were Mr. Raphaelson; Robert Mueller, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division; (281) Fred Verinder, Deputy Assistant Director, Criminal Division, at FBI Headquarters;(282) Mr. Kendrick; and Thomas Kubic, Section Chief, Banking Crimes Unit.  Mr. Mueller indicated that even though the referral on its face did not contain enough information for the Justice Department to render an opinion, the FBI should investigate the matter to determine whether the case had merit.(283)  As a result of the meeting, FBI Headquarters instructed its Little Rock Field Office to conduct a limited investigation into the matters described in the Criminal Referral C0004 and specifically directed the office to review the exhibits.(284)

<P>Although Mr. Bank assured the FBI that he would review the 300 exhibits, neither he nor Mr. Dodson ever reviewed them.(285)  On October 16, 1992, Mr. Banks wrote to Donald Pettus, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Little Rock Field Office, to inform him that the U.S. Attorney's Office would not participate in any investigation regarding Criminal Referral C0004 until after the 1992 presidential election.(286)  Mr. Banks indicated that he believed no prosecutable case existed against any of the witnesses, and that "the only allegations having any credibility are against the McDougals and Anspaugh." (287)<P>

<P>On the same day, the FBI Little Rock Field Office also notified Mr. Kendrick at FBI Headquarters by teletype that the limited data "may indicate criminal activity on the part of the captioned subjects, James and Susan McDougal, and Lisa Anspaugh.  However, USA is holding opinion of prosecutive opinion regarding these subjects in abeyance."(288)  

<P>Based on the decision of the U.S. Attorney's Office to defer any prosecutorial consideration, the Field Office also adopted a non-investigative posture on Crminal Referral C0004.(289)

<P>B.<P> Criminal Referral C0004 gets lost at the Justice Department.

<P>Criminal referral C0004 remained in the U.S. Attorney's Office until January 27, 1993, when Mr. Banks requested, in a letter to Donna Henneman, Ethics Program Manager at the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, that Main Justice assume responsibility for any further action.(290)  Mr. Banks believed that his office had a conflict of interest because of its unsuccessful criminal prosecution of Mr. McDougal in 1990.(291)  Mr. Banks concluded that "[a] limited preliminary investigation of allegations pertinent to Mr. and Mrs. McDougal and Ms. Anspaugh should be considered," and that interviews of these individuals should determine whether there is merit to further investigation.(292)  

<P>On February 9, 1993, Anthony Moscato, Director of the Executive Office of United States Attorneys, forwarded Mr. Banks' request to Stuart Gerson, then Acting Attorney General, through Douglas Frazier, Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General.(293)  Mr. Frazier prepared a recusal package and sent it to the Criminal Division for its recommendation.(294)

<P>On February 22, 1993, Gerald McDowell, Chief of the Frauds Section at Main Justice, directed a young trial attorney, Mark MacDougall, to analyze the criminal referral.(295)  Just one day later, on February 23, 1993, without even reviewing the 300 exhibits, Mr. MacDougal prepared a memorandum in which he concluded that Crminal Referral C0004 did not appear to warrant any criminal investigation.(296) 

<P> Main Justice officials decided against rendering an opinion on the merits of the referral.  Instead, Main Justice rejected Mr. Banks' request for recusal and returned the referral to Mr. Banks to let his office decide whether to investigate further or to decline prosecution.(297)

<P>On March 19, 1993, Acting Assistant Attorney General John Keeney prepared a memorandum for Mr. Frazier rejecting recusal:

<P>We have reviewed the material in the package and have concluded that there is no identifiable basis for recusal by the United States Attorney.  Further, we would not question a decision by the United States Attorney to decline further substantive action on the referral.(298) 



Main Justice wanted Mr. Banks to make the ultimate decision on the referral.  Allen Carver, Deputy Chief of the Fraud Section, Criminal Division, testified that the memorandum prepared by Mr. MacDougall did not constitute a conclusion by Main Justice not to prosecute the case,(299)  and that the matter was sent to the U.S. Attorney's Office for a determinative opinion.(300)

<P>Although Mr. Frazier believed that he should have received Mr. Keeney's memorandum in March, he did not receive it until the end of May or June, when it suddenly "appeared out of nowhere."(301)  Thus, for more than two months, Mr. Banks was not advised of Main Justice's decision to reject his request for recusal.(302)    

<P>By May 1993, the U.S. Attorney's Office still had not sent a response to Ms. Lewis on whether a decision had been made to decline or prosecute Criminal Referral C0004.  After Mr. Banks' resignation in March 1993,(303)  Ms. Lewis wrote to Acting U.S. Attorney Richard Pence in Little Rock to inquire about the status of the referral.  Mr. Pence notified Ms. Lewis that the matter had been referred to Main Justice.(304)

<P>Ms. Lewis then contacted Ms. Henneman of the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys to ask about the status of Crminal Referral C0004.  After a number of inquiries, Ms. Henneman located, within the Fraud Section at Main Justice, the March 19 memorandum declining Mr. Banks' request for recusal.  Ms. Henneman then forwarded a copy of the memorandum to Mr. Frazier.(305)  Finally, in July 1993, Main Justice sent a package of materials, including the March 19 memorandum, to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Little Rock.(306)

<P>Mr. Pence discussed Criminal Referral C0004 with Assistant United States Attorney Fletcher Jackson.(307)  He took no other action.  Mr. Jackson advised Mr. Pence that he wanted to review the referral exhibits to determine whether any of the Madison Guaranty transactions were related to his ongoing investigation of David Hale and Capital Management Services, Inc.(308)  

<P>Although a decision on a criminal referral is usually issued within 60-90 days after submission, the U.S. Attorney's Office did not render a prosecutorial opinion on Criminal Referral C0004 until October 27, 1993 -- over one year after its submission -- when Ms. Casey formally declined the referral.(309)  The length of time that it took for the referral to be acted upon was unusually long in the experience of Mr. Iorio and Ms. Lewis.  Mr. Iorio testified that the normal time period for a United States Attorney to act on an RTC criminal referral was around 60 days;(310)  Ms. Lewis testified that she generally received responses within 30 to 45 days.(311)

<P>The final decision to decline prosecution was made without anyone having reviewed the exhibits.  Indeed, no one at the U.S. Attorney's office in charge of handling Crminal Referral C0004 ever reviewed or analyzed the 300 exhibits.(312)

<P>

III.Interference with the RTC's Ongoing Investigation of Madison. 

<P>

<P>From May through August 1993, while Crminal Referral C0004 was in the hands of the Justice Department, Ms. Lewis, at the express direction of her supervisors -- Mr. Ausen and Mr. Iorio -- continued to investigate Madison Guaranty.(313)  RTC Kansas City investigators Mike Caron, Ed Noyes, and Randy Knight joined Ms. Lewis in this effort.(314)  

<P>According to Ms. Lewis, this phase of the RTC's investigation uncovered:

<P>several transactions involving insider abuse, self-dealing, money laundering, embezzlement, diversion of loan proceeds, payments of excessive commissions, misappropriation of funds, land flips, inflated appraisals, falsification of loan records and board minutes, chronic overdraft status of various subsidiaries, joint ventures and real estate investments, regulatory violations of investments in subsidiaries, wire fraud, and illegal campaign contributions.(315)   

<P>

As a result, the RTC prepared nine new criminal referrals concerning Madison Guaranty.(316)  These referrals were completed on September 24, 1993.(317)  

<P>The 1993 referrals alleged the commission of crimes involving, among other things, bank fraud, conspiracy, false statements, false documents, wire fraud, aiding and abetting, and misuse of position.(318)  The nine referrals identified multiple suspects of criminal wrongdoing -- including Mr. and Mrs. McDougal, several former Madison Guaranty officers and borrowers, Mr. Tucker, and the Bill Clinton Political Committee Fund.(319)  President and Mrs. Clinton were listed as witnesses in three referrals,(320); Beverly Bassett Schaffer, the former Commissioner of the Arkansas Securities Department, was listed in one referral.(321)

<P>Criminal Referral #730CR0192 alleged that Mr. McDougal embezzled money from Madison Guaranty, by channelling it through the Whitewater account.(322)  In April 1985, Mr. McDougal transferred $30,000 from the Whitewater account at Madison Guaranty to former Senator J.W. Fulbright.(323)  As the balance of the Whitewater account was $270, this transfer caused the account to be overdrawn.(324)  Later that month, the overdraft was cured when Madison Financial deposited $30,000 into the Whitewater account.(325)  According to minutes of a Madison Financial Board of Directors' meeting, the $30,000 was supposedly a prepayment of Mr. McDougal's annual bonus.(326)

<P>The referral stated that "the unauthorized prepayment of McDougal's annual bonus was simply a method to allow McDougal to embezzle funds through manipulation of the accounts which he controlled.  He clearly used the White Water account to pay his unknown obligation to J.W. Fulbright and schemed to deprive Madison Financial Corporation of funds to reimburse the White Water account."(327)  

<P>President and Mrs. Clinton were listed as potential witness to suspected criminal activity.(328)  Ms. Lewis testified that the Clintons were included as potential witnesses because, as owners of the closely-held Whitewater corporation, they might "have had knowledge of what was going on with the finances of their corporation."(329)

<P>A second referral, number 730CR0196, alleged that "James B. McDougal, and MGS&L shareholder and former Director, Charles Peacock III, . . . conspired to misappropriate thrift funds for the purpose of making illegal campaign contributions to the benefit of Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton."(330)  The referral named Mr. McDougal, Mr. Peacock, and the Bill Clinton Political Committee Fund as criminal suspects.(331)

<P>The referral identified four $3,000 checks, all of which were dated April 4, 1985, drawn on Madison Guaranty accounts, and deposited in the Bill Clinton Political Committee account at the Bank of Cherry Valley.(332)  The first check was written by Mrs. McDougal on the McDougals' personal checking account at Madison Guaranty and made payable to the "Bill Clinton Political Committee."(333)  The second check, a Madison Guaranty cashier's check purchased in the name of J.W. Fulbright, was also made payable to the "Bill Clinton Political Committee."(334)  The referral alleged that this check was funded by a check issued by Flowerwood Farms, one of the McDougals' companies.(335)

<P>The third and fourth checks were each $3,000 cashier's checks drawn on Madison Guaranty.  The checks were purchased in the names of Ken Peacock and Dean Landrum, respectively, and made payable to Bill Clinton.(336)  The referral alleged that former Madison Guaranty director Charles Peacock III, the father of Ken Peacock and the business partner of Mr. Landrum, purchased these checks by diverting part of the proceeds of a $50,000 Madison Guaranty loan.(337)  The three cashier's checks were numbered sequentially -- Q2496, Q2497 and Q2498 --(338), and Mr. Landrum's first name, Dene, was misspelled on the check.(339)<P>  

<P>The referral further suggested that Mr. McDougal may have received benefits from then-Governor Clinton in exchange for $6,000 in campaign contributions.  The referral observed that during the month the $3,000 checks were written, Mrs. Clinton, then a partner in the Rose Law Firm, had sent a letter to the Arkansas Securities Department seeking approval of Madison Guaranty's plan to issue a class of preferred stock.(340)  The referral noted that the plan was approved the next month by the Arkansas Securities Commissioner, Beverly Bassett Schaffer, who had been appointed to her post by then-Governor Clinton.(341)  The referral also remarked that Madison Guaranty's request for approval to issue preferred stock came at a time when Madison Guaranty was badly in need of additional capital.(342)<P><P>

<P>The referral named both Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Schaffer as possible witnesses.(343)<P>

<P>Ms. Lewis believed that "there was a very strong possibility of a quid pro quo in the selection of Ms. Bassett into [her] position"(344) and that "there was a possibility of a quid pro quo situation" with respect to "Mrs. Clinton and the Rose firm representing Madison."(345)

<P>The nine referrals were submitted to the Justice Department on October 8, 1993.(346)

<P>The verdicts in the McDougal and Tucker trial prove that actual criminal activity was identified in the RTC referrals.  On August 17, 1995, a federal grand jury convened in the Eastern District of Arkansas returned a twenty-one count indictment against Mr. and Mrs. McDougal, and Governor Tucker alleging conspiracy, bank fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, misapplication of funds, and the making of false statements and false entries.(347)  The Office of the Independent Counsel ("OIC") prosecuted the three defendants and, on May 28, 1996, after a lengthy trial, a jury in Little Rock convicted Mr. McDougal on 18 of 19 counts in the indictment, Mrs. McDougal on four counts, and Governor Tucker on two counts.(348)

<P>Many of the felony counts on which the defendants were convicted were based on suspected criminal activity identified in the RTC referrals.  Count one of the indictment, a criminal conspiracy charge on which both Mr. McDougal and Governor Tucker were convicted, involved a $260,000 loan obtained by Mr. Tucker from Madison Guaranty and the "flip" of property at 1308 Main Street in Little Rock.  This count closely tracked allegations made in RTC Criminal Referrals #730CR0190 and #730CR0198.(349)  The jury also convicted Mr. McDougal on charges of misapplication of funds (counts 17 and 18) and making false record entries (count 19) related to the land flip at 1308 Main Street -- the suspected crime described in Criminal Referral #730CR0198.(350)

<P>Three additional charges on which Mr. McDougal was convicted -- count 5 (mail fraud), count 6 (fraud), and count 7 (false statement), tracked the suspected criminal activity identified in Criminal Referral #730CR0199.  That referral outlined suspected crimes committed by Mr. McDougal in connection with his development of resort property on Campobello Island, off the coast of New Brunswick, Canada.36 

<P>Finally, five of the counts on which the jury returned guilty verdicts -- counts 1, 13, 14, 15, and 16 -- related to a fraudulent $300,000 loan made to Mrs. McDougal's company, Master Marketing, from Capital Management Services.(351)  The proceeds of that loan were tracked in the first Madison Guaranty referral, Criminal Referral C0004.

<P>Despite the proven success of the Kansas City investigators' efforts, they encountered a concerted effort to hamper their investigative efforts.  Both Ms. Lewis and Mr. Iorio testified that obstacles were placed in the way of the RTC's investigation into Madison Guaranty and Whitewater.  Ms. Lewis "believe[d] there was a concerted effort to obstruct, hamper and manipulate the results of our investigation of Madison."(352)

<P>Mr. Iorio shared that view.(353)  He also described as "unprecedented" the "scrutiny that had been focused on the efforts of preparing the referrals and the subsequent review of the referrals."(354)  He explained:

<P><P>Through this arduous process, the Kansas City office of investigations has been subjected to an alteration of the work environment that included instigation of special procedures, a new review critique mechanism, a slow down of information flow, information leaks, and for us, Jean Lewis, Lee Ausen, and myself, the uncertainty of being placed on administrative leave, without prior notification to RTC investigations management in Washington, D.C.  At that point, the review of our work appeared to be more than an effort to confirm or deny our findings.  Instead, it appeared that three of us had become the messengers of unwanted news, and if history serves as a guide, are often the targets of attack meant to deflect attention from the information the messengers bring.(355)

<P>Part of the pattern of intimidation, interference, and outright obstruction was the subjecting of the second set of criminal referrals to an unprecedented written "legal review" by the Professional Liability Section ("PLS") of the RTC.  The second set of nine criminal referrals related to Madison Guaranty were completed and signed by September 24, 1993, and the Kansas City RTC investigators had planned to send the referrals to the Justice Department on October 1, 1993.(356)

<P>On September 30, 1993, however, Julie Yanda, the Chief of the Professional Liability Section37  in the RTC Kansas City office, demanded that her staff be given the opportunity to conduct a "legal review" of the referrals.(357)  Ms. Lewis was concerned that the review was "a delay tactic,"(358) and, on October 4, 1993, she shared her concerns with RTC Regional Inspector General Dan Sherry.(359)

<P>Two senior RTC PLS attorneys, Karen Carmichael and Philip Adams, prepared this so-called "legal review" -- a 13-page memorandum, dated October 7, 1993, and addressed to Ms. Yanda.(360)  For each referral, the memorandum posed between six and 12 brief questions stemming from the authors' "concerns" about the referrals.(361)  The memorandum did not  answer or analyze the questions it raised.  And, it offered no suggestions for revising the referrals, gave no conclusions about the referrals, and contained no recommendations with respect to what action the RTC should take.(362)

<P>On October 8, 1993, PLS provided its legal review to the criminal investigators,(363) and the nine referrals were submitted to the United States Attorney's Office.(364)  Thus, the only effect of this legal review was to delay the submission of the referrals by one week.  The referrals were submitted exactly as they had been written prior to the PLS review.(365)

<P>Ms. Lewis and Mr. Iorio both described PLS's request to delay the submission of criminal referrals for a legal review as "unprecedented."(366)  According to Ms. Lewis, PLS had never before reviewed any other criminal referrals prepared by the Kansas City criminal investigations unit.(367)  Mr. Iorio similarly testified that "[t]he request to do a critique of the referrals, that was the first time this had happened and it was with regard to the nine Madison criminal referrals."(368)  He also stated that subsequent referrals were not reviewed prior to their submission in all cases.(369)

<P>Ms. Yanda claimed that her request for a legal review of the Madison Guaranty referrals was based on a June 17, 1993 RTC memorandum on the handling of criminal referrals.(370)  That memorandum stated: "[e]xcept in rare circumstances, criminal referrals shall be reviewed by RTC Investigations and Legal Division Criminal Coordinators before they are delivered to the U.S. Attorney and the FBI or any other investigative agency."(371)  

<P>Other RTC officials had a different view of the June 17, 1993 memorandum than Ms. Yanda.  Mr. Iorio did not read the memorandum to require that the submission of criminal referrals be delayed pending PLS's review.  According to Mr. Iorio, under the June 17 memorandum,  PLS was "to be provided with a copy of any outgoing criminal referrals for their review as a means to exchange information, but you are not dependent upon them critiquing your referrals and telling you it's all right to send them."(372)  Mr. Iorio's understanding was based on conversations with Mr. Dudine and Carl Gamble, the criminal coordinator in the RTC Washington, D.C. office, who he understood to have authored the memorandum.(373)  Also, Kenneth Donahue of the RTC Office of Investigations in Washington, D.C., told Ms. Yanda that he helped draft the June 17, 1993 memorandum, and that it had not been intended that PLS would prepare legal reviews of all referrals prior to their submission to the Justice Department.(374)

<P>Soon after the nine new criminal referrals were sent to the U.S. Attorney's Office, Ms. Lewis began to encounter more difficulties in conducting the Madison Guaranty investigation.  In October 1993, Ms. Lewis was removed from the Madison Guaranty "communications loop" by the PLS criminal coordinator.(375)  That same month, Mr. Iorio advised Ms. Lewis that PLS personnel had complained that she communicated directly with the U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI in Little Rock, concerning Madison Guaranty.(376)

<P>On November 9, 1993, at the direction of Ms. Yanda, Ms. Lewis was removed from the position as lead investigator on the Madison Guaranty criminal case.(377)  According to Mr. Iorio, "[t]here was some friction between Jean and Julie's criminal coordinator, Karen Carmichael, and Julie came to me and asked me to remove Jean."(378)  When asked about this meeting,  Ms. Yanda claimed that she "laid out for Mr. Iorio a series of events that had troubled me greatly concerning Ms. Lewis and her failure to act as a team member and work with the legal division in concert to try to move matters along successfully to the benefit of the RTC."(379)  

<P>Mr. Iorio and Mr. Ausen told Ms. Lewis that she was being removed from the Madison Guaranty investigation "to avoid me taking a bullet I didn't deserve."(380)  On November 10, 1993, Ms. Lewis wrote in an e-mail, "[j]ust a heads up to let you know that Mike Caron, Senior Criminal Investigator, is now the lead investigator on Madison . . . The Powers that Be have decided that I'm better off out of the line of fire (and I ain't arguing)."(381)  

<P>The removal of Ms. Lewis from the Madison Guaranty investigation was only part of a larger pattern of interference by senior officials in the RTC's investigation.  April Breslaw, a PLS attorney, was at the center of this effort.  Throughout 1994, Ms. Breslaw sought to discourage RTC employees from investigating Madison Guaranty and informed RTC investigators that senior RTC officials preferred that any such investigation reach a certain outcome.  

<P>Ms. Breslaw's first contact with Madison Guaranty was in 1989.  In March 1989, Ms. Breslaw -- then an attorney in the FDIC Directors and Officers Liability Section -- retained the Rose Law Firm to handle a malpractice suit against Madison Guaranty's former independent accountants, Frost & Company.(382)  In January 1990, Ms. Breslaw was detailed to the RTC's Professional Liability Section.(383)  In April 1991, the Frost case was settled.(384)  In January 1994, Ms. Breslaw was put on a team of RTC attorneys reviewing Madison civil claims.(385)  In March 1994, Ms. Breslaw recused herself from the Madison case.(386)

<P>In late 1993 and early 1994, after public allegations arose that the Rose Law Firm had a conflict of interest, Ms. Breslaw's decision to hire the Rose Law Firm to represent the FDIC (and later the RTC) came under considerable scrutiny.(387)  In September 1993, Sue Schmidt, a Washington Post reporter, contacted Ms. Breslaw about Rose's representation of the RTC.(388)  Later that fall, the FDIC Legal Division commenced a review of the hiring of the Rose Law Firm for the Frost case.(389)  The Office of Investigations in the Kansas City RTC office also began that fall to examine Madison civil issues, including Rose Law Firm conflicts issues.(390)  In January 1994, the RTC Office of Contractor Oversight and Surveillance also started to investigate Rose conflicts issues.(391) 

<P>On January 12, 1994, Ms. Breslaw sent an e-mail message to Mr. Iorio and James Thompson, the Vice President of the Kansas City RTC office responsible for investigations.(392)  In the e-mail, Ms. Breslaw stated that "[i]t's my understanding that Kansas Investigations has attempted to evaluate the decision to hire the Rose Law Firm to represent the government against Frost & Co."(393)  She then attempted to persuade Mr. Thompson and Mr. Iorio to call off the investigation:

<P>[Y]ou should be aware that the FDIC is conducting its own investigation of this matter.  Trial attorneys from their Special Litigation unit are in the process of both evaluating relevant documents and interviewing witnesses.  By all indications, this project is being handled in a professional manner. . . . In light of all of this, I suggest that Investigations discontinue its inquiry into this matter.(394)

  

<P>Within days of sending this e-mail, Ms. Breslaw warned RTC investigator Gary Davidson against pursuing an investigation of Madison, saying that certain RTC managers would take a "dim view" of such an investigation.(395)  In a February 18, 1994 memorandum addressed to Mr. Iorio, Mr. Davidson recounted his conversation with Ms. Breslaw:

<P>On January 11, 1994, you requested that I conduct a preliminary investigation into Madison Guaranty, for possible Civil Fraud claims. . . . On January 13th or 14th, I called the assigned PLS attorney, April Breslaw, for the purpose of asking whether she knew of any fraudulent activity that was not addressed in the Criminal Referrals.

<P>

<P>Before I could ask my intended question, April asked if I was conducting an investigation into Madison Guaranty.  After acknowledging that I was, she indicated that what she was about to tell me was being stated as politely as she could.  April felt that I should know there are some RTC people in management positions that would take a "dim view" of me investigating Madison Guaranty.  She also advised that I should be very careful of who I talk to and what I say, because of the people associated with Madison Guaranty.(396)



<P>Mr. Davidson came to Mr. Iorio within a few days after he had received Ms. Breslaw's warning that RTC management "would take a `dim view' of [him] investigating Madison Guaranty."(397)  Mr. Iorio told Mr. Davidson to memorialize what Ms. Breslaw had said because he "thought it was very unusual."(398)  Mr. Davidson interpreted Ms. Breslaw's comments as "definitely a threat."(399)

<P>Ms. Breslaw recalled a conversation with Mr. Davidson but denied telling him that some RTC managers would take a "dim view" of him investigating Madison.(400)  She remembered only cautioning Mr. Davidson about speaking to the press.(401)  But Ms. Breslaw's testimony is contradicted by a July 12, 1994 memorandum she wrote to RTC Deputy General Counsel Andrew Tomback.  In that memorandum, Ms. Breslaw admitted that she had told Mr. Davidson that some people "would take a dim view" of an investigation in Rose Law Firm conflicts issues:

<P>Gary called me in 1994 to quiz me about the Rose Law Firm.  In response, I reminded Gary that the FDIC had taken responsibility for evaluating Rose Firm conflicts and that it was not appropriate for RTC Kansas investigations to go further into that matter.  I believe I told Gary that the senior people would take a dim view of further Kansas inquiry into Rose Law Firm conflicts issues.(402)

<P>On February 2, 1994, at the direction of Mark Gabrellian, Counsel for the Legal Division of the RTC, Ms. Breslaw traveled to the Kansas City RTC Office of Investigations to review Madison documents in connection with the RTC's recently reopened Madison civil investigation.(403)  That afternoon, Ms. Breslaw and Ms. Lewis spoke for approximately 40 minutes.(404)  Ms. Lewis recorded their conversation.38   On the tape, a speaker who Ms. Lewis identified as Ms. Breslaw stated:

<P><P><P>I think if they can say it honestly, the head people -- Jack Ryan and Ellen Kulka, would like to be able to say "Whitewater did not cause a loss to Madison."  We don't know, you know, what Fiske is going to find and we don't offer any opinion on it.  But the problem is nobody has been able to say to Ryan and Kulka, "Sure say that, that's fine."(405)  



At the time, Mr. Ryan was the RTC's CEO and Ms. Kulka was its General Counsel.

<P>Ms. Breslaw also was recorded saying:

<P><P><P>Well, you know, as I say -- I feel self-conscious asking that, because in some ways it is kind of a silly question.  But it's the kind of thing, they're looking for what they can say, and I do believe they want to say something honest, but I don't believe at all, and I don't want to suggest at all, that they want us to move to certain conclusions.  I really don't get that feeling.

<P><P>But there are answers they would be happier about, you know, because it would<P> get them, you know, off the hook, you know, and that would be it about<P> Whitewater.  So that is why we keep getting asked the same things.(406)



In Ms. Lewis's view, "it is clear that Ms. Breslaw was there to deliver a message that 'the people at the top would like to be able to say Whitewater did not cause a loss to Madison.'"(407)

<P>Ms. Breslaw initially denied having made this statement to Ms. Lewis.  On March 24, 1994, Representative James A Leach stated on the floor of the House of Representatives that "[o]n February 2, 1994, the day Roger Altman briefed the White House on Madison Guaranty, April Breslaw, RTC Senior Attorney, visited the Kansas City office and said that Washington would like to say that Whitewater caused no losses to Madison."(408)39   That same day, Ms. Breslaw sent an e-mail to several persons within the RTC, saying "[a]s you may know, Congressman Leach made a statement regarding the so-called 'Whitewater' affair on the floor of the Congress today.  At one point he made specific reference to me.  I want you to know that I categorically deny making the statement which he attributed to me. . . . I did not say that anyone from Washington 'would like to say' anything."(409)

<P>On March 25, 1994, the day after Representative Leach made his statement, Ms. Breslaw met with Ms. Kulka and Assistant General Counsel Thomas Hindes to discuss Representative Leach's statement.  The notes of Ms. Kulka's secretary, Wilma Lekan,(410) reflect that at the meeting Ms. Breslaw stated that she had discussed Whitewater with Ms. Lewis and mentioned both Ms. Kulka and Mr. Ryan but denied saying that the two wanted a particular outcome: 

<P>April said that she told Jean that we had been getting inquiri[es] in Washington about Whitewater.  She said she told her that Ellen and Jack Ryan had been getting inquiries (she said that she was thinking of the tolling agreements and the D'Amato letter.)  April said that this was the only point where she mentioned Ellen Kulka and Jack Ryan.



<P>April says that she denies saying that Ellen Kulka or Jack Ryan wanted a particular outcome or wanted the loss numbers to be anything.(411)

<P>Before the Special Committee, Ms. Breslaw recalled speaking to Ms. Lewis on February 2, 1994,(412) but she claimed that she did not recall making the statement that "if they can say it honestly, the head people, Jack Ryan and Ellen Kulka, would like to be able to say Whitewater did not cause a loss to Madison."(413)40 

<P>Ms. Breslaw claimed that she was "not sure" whether it was her the voice on the tape recording.(414)  She implausibly testified that "I don't know what my voice sounds like on the tape, or on a tape,"(415) and that "I guess all I can say is that I don't know what I sound like on tape."(416)  She finally admitted "I have no reason to think that this is not my voice."(417) 

<P>In an e-mail dated June 28, 1994, Ms. Breslaw expressed concern about any production of documents to the Senate related to her conversation with Ms. Lewis:

<P>I have the impression that we're in the midst of producing doc's to the Senate banking committee in anticipation of the hearing scheduled for the end of July.  If anybody is considering producing anything that has anything to do with my conversation with Jean Lewis, I'd like to talk about whether its responsive to the committee's request.  It's my understanding that the senate rejected amendments which might have brought this incident into the scope of the hearings.(418) 

<P>On August 15, 1994, the three Madison investigators were placed on administrative leave for two weeks.(419)  The RTC took this action without any warning or explanation.  On that fateful day, after Mr. Ausen and Mr. Iorio arrived at work, they were summoned to an office and told that they had been placed on administrative leave.(420)  The three investigators then were escorted to their offices and finally out of the building.(421)  They were told to stay off RTC property.(422)  Their offices were locked and sealed.

<P>On the night of August 15, Ms. Lewis, then in the hospital, received a call from Edward Noyes, a member of the Madison investigative team, who advised her Mr. Iorio and Mr. Ausen had been placed on administrative leave.(423)  Mr. Noyes told her that "the purge has begun."(424)  He telephoned later to let Ms. Lewis know that she had also been placed on leave.(425)

<P>The three Madison investigators each received an identical one-page memorandum, dated August 12, 1994, from Mr. Hindes.(426)  The memorandum stated "[y]ou are hereby placed on Administrative Leave to be effective immediately upon receipt on August 15, 1994" but offered no explanation for the adverse employment action.(427)  Although the August 12th memorandum indicated that "[i]f you have any questions you may contact Randi L. Mendelsohn, Chief, Employee Relations, OHRM [Office of Human Resource Management],"  Ms. Mendelsohn refused to advise Mr. Iorio's counsel why he had been placed on administrative leave.(428)  Ms. Mendelsohn refused offers to have Mr. Iorio answer questions, provide documents, answer charges, or otherwise provide assistance.(429)  According to Ms. Lewis, the three were not contacted for interviews or information.(430)

<P>On August 29, 1994, Mr. Iorio, Mr. Ausen, and Ms. Lewis were told to return to work.(431)  The three still did not receive any explanation for why they were put on administrative leave.(432)<P>

<P>The RTC never provided an explanation to Ms. Lewis, Mr. Ausen and Mr. Iorio, although Mr. Iorio believed the action was related to the Madison investigation.(433) 

<P>In August 1994, Mr. Iorio and Ms. Lewis through counsel requested that the RTC OIG investigate the matter.(434)  John J. Adair, the Inspector General of the RTC, testified that in August 1994 his office received requests from attorneys for two or three of the Madison investigators and from Mr. Ryan to investigate the matter.(435)

<P>On the Friday before the administrative leave of the three Madison investigators was to end, Mr. Adair, received a telephone call from Andrew Tomback, Assistant General Counsel, and RTC attorney Erica Cooper,(436) who "indicated to me that perhaps my office would want to, my agents would want to search the offices of the three individuals."(437)  Mr. Adair told Mr. Tomback and Ms. Cooper that such a search "didn't seem to be an appropriate thing for us to do absent any really good reason to do that."41 (438)

<P>  Before the RTC OIG could proceed with the investigation, the OIC advised that inquiry by the RTC IG into the administrative leave matter would interfere with the his work.(439)  Accordingly, the RTC OIG suspended its investigation.

IV.Paula Casey Delays her Recusal from Madison, Handles the Hale Pleas Negotiations, and Declines to Prosecute Criminal Referral C0004.

<P>

<P>A.<P>Investigations of Capital Management and David Hale.



<P>During the summer of 1993, even before the RTC submitted its second set of criminal referrals relating to Madison Guaranty, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Arkansas began investigating David Hale, a Little Rock municipal judge who owned a Small Business Investment Corporation ("SBIC") called Capital Management Services, Inc. ("CMS").  Mr. Hale was accused of fraudulently obtaining SBA loans.

<P>On July 20, 1993, the date of Vincent Foster's death, the FBI obtained a search warrant and seized loan documents from Mr. Hale's CMS offices.  Some of the documents contained references to Mr. Tucker, as well as a $300,000 loan to Mrs. McDougal d/b/a Master Marketing.(440)  As a result of information obtained in its investigation of Mr. Hale, by August 20, 1993, the Little Rock FBI had opened a separate fraud investigation of Mr. Hale and Mr. McDougal.(441)

<P>The SBA certified CMS as a Specialized SBIC on March 14, 1979.(442)  Over the next 14 years, the SBA examined CMS eleven times.(443)  Although five examinations found no improprieties, six identified various areas of regulatory concern.  Specifically, the SBA raised concerns about CMS's financing of businesses that did not qualify as socially or economically disadvantaged.(444)  The SBA also faulted CMS for lending to businesses that were controlled by Mr. Hale's associates.(445)

<P>In late 1992, despite its spotty compliance record, CMS and Mr. Hale applied for $6 million in additional leverage from the SBA.(446)  Mr. Hale represented to the SBA that he had a $13.8 million increase in CMS assets(447) in the form of non-cash assets that investors had provided to CMS.(448)  On October 28, 1992, the SBA rejected Mr. Hale's application for financing, and requested additional information relating to donated assets.  Mr. Hale then informed the SBA that the donated assets consisted of $11.5 million in medical receivables of an investment pool and $2.3 million in stock of a company named National Building Supply.(449)  On December 8, 1992, the SBA gave Mr. Hale conditional approval for the capital increase -- that is, to accept the donated assets.(450)  The SBA, however, informed Mr. Hale that the assets could only be used for regulatory purposes -- i.e, to support the $6 million in additional financing -- until the assets were converted to cash and their value had been validated.(451)

<P>On February 19, 1993, at Mr. Hale's request, Wayne Foren, then the SBA's Associate Administrator for Investment, met with Mr. Hale in Washington, D.C. to withdraw his application for additional SBA financing for CMS.(452)  According to Mr. Foren: "In other words, he wanted the problem to go away.  He didn't want to answer the questions of where did the assets come from."(453)  But Mr. Foren persisted in questioning Mr. Hale about the donated assets: "And I said David, why would anybody give you tens of millions of dollars worth of assets?  Doesn't make sense. . . . Either these assets are not worth the represented value, in which case you are perpetrating a fraud on SBA, or you are being bribed."(454)

<P>Mr. Hale told Mr. Foren that he was close to the current governor of Arkansas, Jim Guy Tucker, and to President Clinton,(455) and "[t]hat he had access to both."(456)  "His answer was people gave him the money, would give him the money because he could do things for them in Arkansas."(457)  Mr. Hale elaborated that an individual, who was interested in starting an insurance company in Arkansas, had put money into CMS by routing the funds through the Central Arkansas Community Development Corporation, a non-profit corporation.(458)  The money was given to Mr. Hale for "[g]etting things done in Arkansas" and to "solve problems."(459)  When Mr. Foren expressed concern over the arrangement, Mr. Hale replied, "well, Wayne, you have to understand this is the way we do business in Arkansas."(460)

<P>Mr. Foren found Mr. Hale's statements regarding his relationship with Governor Tucker and President Clinton to be credible.(461)  Indeed, in May 1993, after Mr. Foren had referred the case to the SBA Inspector General ("SBA IG") for further investigation, Mr. Hale called Mr. Foren and requested that he attend a meeting with Governor Tucker and a representative of the Arkansas Development Finance Authority.(462)  Mr. Foren declined to attend the meeting because "[i]t is inappropriate for me to attend a meeting on this kind of a subject called by David Hale while we're -- we have made a referral for investigation of his company."(463)

<P>On March 11, 1993, the SBA issued a regulatory compliance report on CMS that "raised questions relative to the donated assets and the values" on those assets.(464)  Specifically, the report identified the source of the $11.5 million investment pool certificate as an offshore company incorporated in the Grand Cayman Islands.(465)  According to Mr. Foren, the mysterious source of the assets raised "another red flag" for regulators.(466)  In addition, the SBA determined from documents that National Building Supply filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that the stock donated to CMS was worthless; National Building Supply was bankrupt.(467)  On March 26, 1993, as a result of the examination report, the SBA sent Mr. Hale an examination letter(468) disclosing the results of the examination and requiring Mr. Hale to provide additional information and/or take corrective action.(469)  On April 20, 1993, Mr. Hale responded that he disagreed with the conclusions and findings of the examination.

<P>On May 5, 1993, Mr. Foren referred the matter to the SBA IG for investigation.(470)  Arnold Hawkins, the SBA's Regional Inspector General,(471) determined that the case would require considerable investigative resources.(472)  Because the SBA IG did not have an office in Little Rock, Mr. Hawkins and other SBA officials decided to refer the matter directly to the FBI on May 20, 1993.(473)

<P>The FBI then proceeded to investigate CMS and Mr. Hale.  On June 14, 1993, the FBI requested that the SBA provide documents concerning CMS and Mr. Hale.(474)  On July 20, 1993, the FBI obtained a search warrant for CMS records.(475)  The next day, the subpoena was served and loan documents were seized from the CMS offices.(476)   Some of the documents contained references to Mr. Tucker, while others referred to the $300,000 CMS loan to Susan McDougal d/b/a Master Marketing.(477)

<P>On September 23, 1993, a grand jury indicted Mr. Hale on various federal charges relating to the operation of CMS.  Mr. Hale has since pleaded guilty to two federal charges and he cooperated with the investigation by the OIC into alleged criminal conduct arising from the operation of CMS, Whitewater, and Madison.(478)

<P>B.<P>Plea Negotiations with David Hale.

<P>In May 1993, while the SBA and FBI were investigating Mr. Hale, President Clinton nominated Ms. Casey to be the new U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas.  Ms. Casey had no prior prosecutorial experience,(479) but she had close ties to the President and Mrs. Clinton.  She worked on Clinton gubernatorial campaigns(480), attended a law school class taught by President Clinton, and participated in a law clinic with Mrs. Clinton.(481)  Governor Clinton also had appointed Ms. Casey to a special commission along with Mrs. Clinton, for the development of a new court system and a new juvenile law code,  and to a separate juvenile advisory group.(482)

<P>In addition, Ms. Casey was a longtime personal friend of Mr. and Mrs. Tucker.  She had lobbied Governor Tucker's office in 1993 on behalf of the Arkansas Bar Association.(483)  Ms. Casey's husband also had worked on Governor Tucker's political campaigns and had donated money to him.(484)    

<P>A short time before Ms. Casey took office on August 16, 1993,(485) Randy Coleman, a Little Rock attorney representing Mr. Hale, met with Assistant U.S. Attorney Fletcher Jackson.(486)  Mr. Coleman testified that he met with Mr. Jackson "to try to determine what was happening since I didn't know at that point in time.  I'd had very little opportunity to visit with my client to educate myself at that point."(487)

<P>Several days later, Mr. Coleman met with Mr. Jackson again.(488)  Mr. Coleman expressed concern about the timing of the indictment of Mr. Hale and whether there would be any time for negotiations.(489)  At this second meeting, Mr. Coleman told Mr. Jackson that Mr. Hale could offer the government information that might lead the U.S. Attorney's Office to Mr. McDougal and possibly to Governor Tucker and President Clinton.(490)  Mr. Coleman recalled that he specifically identified potential areas for cooperation: Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, James McDougal, Susan McDougal, Master Marketing, President Clinton, Governor Tucker, Castle Water & Sewer, Southloop Construction Company and Campobello Realty.(491)  Mr. Coleman was also certain that he mentioned Whitewater to Mr. Jackson.(492)

<P>Mr. Jackson recalled that Mr. Coleman told him that Mr. Hale could help him "get Tucker," and that President Clinton might have some involvement in the Hale transactions.(493)  Based on his investigation of the CMS loan files, Mr. Jackson was aware that the Hale investigation might lead to Governor Tucker and President Clinton: 

<P>[I]f I recall the correct words were -- that I used were that, from Hale, the path would lead to Mr. McDougal, and then the road would divide, one branch would possibly go over to Mr. Tucker, and the other branch would go over possibly to Whitewater and the Clintons.(494)

Mr. Jackson refused, however, to enter into any plea negotiations until Ms. Casey took office.(495)

<P>After Ms. Casey was confirmed, Mr. Jackson briefed her on the Hale investigation.(496)  He advised her that he planned to continue his investigation of other matters involving Mr. Hale that might ultimately lead to Madison Guaranty, the subject of the first RTC criminal referral.  Mr. Jackson also informed Ms. Casey that Mr. Tucker might be a target or a witness in that investigation,(497) and that the RTC expected to make additional criminal referrals relating to Madison Guaranty.(498)

<P>Ms. Casey admitted that "Fletcher told me that his continued investigation of the David Hale matter could possibly involve Governor Tucker.  I don't know that he told me specifically what that involvement might be."(499)  But, Ms. Casey denied that Mr. Jackson advised her of the specific list of persons about whom Mr. Hale might offer evidence.(500) 

<P>On September 7, 1993, Mr. Coleman met with Ms. Casey to discuss a possible plea negotiation for Mr. Hale.(501)  In exchange for his cooperation, Mr. Coleman initially requested that Mr. Hale be granted immunity or charged with a misdemeanor.(502)  Ms. Casey insisted that Mr. Hale enter a plea to an unspecified felony in exchange for a possible sentence reduction depending on the nature of the information offered.(503)  

<P>Mr. Coleman testified that he informed Ms. Casey that Mr. Hale had information regarding important Arkansas political figures.(504)  According to Mr. Coleman, he specifically provided Ms. Casey with the names of President Clinton, Governor Tucker, Madison Guaranty, James McDougal, Susan McDougal, Castle Sewer & Water, Southloop Construction Company, Campobello Realty and Whitewater.(505)  Mr. Coleman understood that Ms. Casey and Mr. Johnson "had already talked with Fletcher and they were aware of some of these things [names of areas of possible cooperation] before I got there. . . ."(506) 

<P>Mr. Coleman further testified that he also offered to make an informal or an "attorney" proffer.(507)  In an "attorney proffer," Mr. Coleman would essentially provide a more detailed summary of evidence Mr. Hale might offer.(508)  Mr. Coleman testified that the government could have accepted his informal proffer without granting immunity to Mr. Hale: "If I make an informal proffer to you through counsel and give you an idea of what is available, the negotiation can carry forward in some form from this point.  I'm trying to get a dialogue started with these people, and I'm not getting anywhere."(509)  Ms. Casey nonetheless gave no response to Mr. Coleman's offer for an informal proffer at the meeting or during the following week.(510)  

<P>Ms. Casey had a markedly different recollection of the September 7 conversation.  She claimed that Mr. Coleman provided no names or concrete information,42  but merely "insinuated that Mr. Hale could give information about people who were too big for me to prosecute."(511)  She did not inquire further about the "big people" because "[i]t may have piqued my interest but my understanding of the way the process works is that his client should proffer his testimony to an agent for evaluation." (512)  Ms. Casey claimed that even though she met with Mr. Jackson several times after her meeting with Mr. Coleman, she still never inquired about the "big people."(513)  

<P>On September 15, 1993, after not hearing from Ms. Casey for a week, Mr. Coleman wrote to her to confirm that he had received no response to his offer of an informal proffer.(514)  The letter stated:

<P>I have offered an informal proffer of Mr. Hale's information for evaluation of its quality and content, but have reached absolutely no interest in the process.(515)

Ms. Casey sent back a letter stating that plea negotiations were at "an impasse" -- reiterating the government's insistence that Mr. Hale plead guilty to a felony.(516) 

<P>On September 20, 1993, Mr. Coleman sent another letter to Ms. Casey, in which he reiterated that he had provided a list of names to Mr. Jackson.(517)  When asked about this letter, Ms. Casey denied again that she ever received any specific names from Mr. Coleman, and claimed that the letter did not prompt her to discuss the matter with Mr. Jackson.(518)  Mr. Johnson similarly claimed that Mr. Coleman never offered any specific information during plea negotiations.(519)

<P>Thus, according to Mr. Coleman, he (1) provided specific names to Mr. Jackson and Ms. Casey --including the President and Governor Tucker -- as areas of cooperation; (2) offered Ms. Casey an informal or attorney proffer; and (3) reiterated in writing that he had offered an informal proffer and given specific areas of cooperation.  Yet, Ms. Casey did not notify Main Justice of, or express any interest in Mr. Coleman's overtures.

<P>Because of Ms. Casey's unwillingness to enter into plea negotiations, Mr. Coleman suggested in his September 15th letter that Ms. Casey recuse herself from the case:(520)

<P>I cannot help but sense the reluctance in the U.S. Attorney's office to enter into plea negotiations in this case. . . .  I cannot help but believe that this reluctance is borne out of the potential political sensitivity and fallout regarding the information which Mr. Hale would provide to your office, but at the same time it is information which would be of substantial assistance in investigating the banking and borrowing practices of some individuals in the elite political circles of the State of Arkansas, past and present. . .



<P>Would it not be appropriate at this point for your office to consider terminating participation in this investigation and to bring in an independent prosecutorial staff, who are not so involved with the histories and personalities and circumstances of this case?(521)

Mr. Coleman believed that Ms. Casey's recusal was appropriate because of her extensive involvement in Arkansas politics:

<P>I knew Paula had been active in the political arena over the years.  I knew her husband had.  I think, at least it was my impression, that all of us were fairly aware at that point in time that there were some substantially prominent folks involved here.  



<P>You could look at the receipt on the search warrant and the nature of the records that the FBI seized from Mr. Hale's office and certainly gather at least that Mr. Tucker's name was prominently displayed.(522)  

However, according to Ms. Casey, she did not need to recuse herself because Mr. Coleman did not proffer any specific information.(523)  Mr. Johnson seconded Ms. Casey's position.(524)

<P>By this time, Ms. Casey knew that Governor Tucker was referenced in both the Hale investigation and the ongoing Madison investigation.(525)  In addition, as early as August, Ms. Casey told Mr. Jackson that if the U.S. Attorney's Office prosecuted Governor Tucker or if the anticipated set of RTC referrals named Governor Tucker, she would have to recuse herself.(526)

<P>Ms. Casey never discussed Mr. Coleman's request for plea negotiations or immunity with Main Justice or notified Main Justice of information that Mr. Coleman said Mr. Hale could proffer.(527)  Even though Mr. Jackson told her that "there was the potential that [Hale] could lead to some people," Ms. Casey claimed that "for that matter I suppose every loan file at SBIC was a potential defendant."(528)

<P>On September 17, 1993, New York Times reporter Jeff Gerth contacted a high ranking Justice Department official, Irv Nathan, Associate Deputy Attorney General,(529) and an FBI Little Rock Field Agent, Robert M. Satowski, to inform them of his interview with Mr. Hale.(530)  Mr. Gerth told them that Mr. Hale was prepared to furnish specific information about sensitive matters, possibly involving the Clintons, including information about a $300,000 loan to Mrs. McDougal that was funneled to Whitewater Development Corporation.(531) 

<P>On the same day, FBI Little Rock sent a teletype to FBI Director Louis Freeh about Mr. Hale's allegations.  The teletype indicated that "Gerth alluded that this was why the United States Attorney Casey would not deal with Coleman when he was attempting to work out a suitable deal for his client."(532)  In a separate memorandum, dated September 21, 1993, to FBI Director Freeh, Mr. Keeney outlined the substance of Mr. Hale's allegations that Mr. McDougal and then-Governor Clinton "encouraged Hale to provide funds to Madison Guaranty, prior to the audit, to bring the Whitewater loans acceptably up to date.  Thereafter Hale, through his Small Business Investment Corporation, lent $300,000 to Susan McDougal, dba Madison Marketing."(533)

<P>Meanwhile, on September 20, 1993, after learning of Mr. Hale's allegations about President Clinton, Mr. Keeney met with other high ranking officials at Main Justice to discuss the need for Ms. Casey to recuse herself from both the SBA fraud case against Mr. Hale and the investigation into Mr. Hale's allegations about Governor Tucker, the McDougals and President Clinton, as well as Criminal Referral C0004 relating to Madison Guaranty.(534)  Mr. Keeney, Principal Deputy Attorney General, Gerald McDowell, Chief of Frauds Section, and Joseph Gangloff, Chief of the Public Integrity Section, all agreed that Ms. Casey should recuse herself from the matter.(535)  

<P>According to Mr. Gangloff, the criteria for recusal include past personal, political or financial relationships between the United States Attorney and the subject of an investigation.  In fact, the mere appearance of a conflict justifies recusal.(536)  According to Mr. Gangloff, Main Justice officials knew Ms. Casey was close to President Clinton and, thus, she "obviously" should recuse herself under the circumstances.(537)  Mr. Gangloff was "surprised" that Ms. Casey had not advised Main Justice of Mr. Hale's allegations about the President, and believed that Main Justice should have been involved in the case sooner.(538)  

<P>Mr. Keeney also believed Ms. Casey "certainly should not be involved in the matter" because "she was the U.S. Attorney in Little Rock, Arkansas.  She was appointed by the Clinton Administration.  And we had a situation where somebody who was under investigation was suggesting . . . that he had information which would implicate the President who appointed her."(539)  Mr. Keeney testified that it was important to him that "she would in fact recuse herself, and that she would not be involved in taking any sort of proffer from David Hale" or make any more substantive decisions on the case.(540)   Mr. Carver and Mr. McDowell also agreed.(541)

<P>At the time, Mr. Keeney based his opinion solely on the fact that Ms. Casey was appointed by President Clinton.(542)  Mr. Keeney testified that although Ms. Casey may have "said something" about her relationship with Governor Tucker, she did not disclose the nature of her relationship with President Clinton.(543)  Ms. Casey did not disclose her August conversation with Mr. Jackson about the expected set of new referrals that might involve Governor Tucker or the fact that the Hale investigation would likely involve Madison Guaranty.(544)

<P>Mr. Keeney called Ms. Casey and told her that she should recuse herself from the Hale and Madison matters.(545)  Mr. Keeney expressed his opinion in "strong terms."(546)  Even though Mr. Keeney was Acting Assistant Attorney General and Ms. Casey was a newly appointed U.S. Attorney with no prior prosecutorial experience, she refused his advice to recuse herself.(547)  Mr. Keeney recalled that Ms. Casey told him: "Well, she said, in essence, I'm a fair person, I'm a person of integrity, I can handle this, this matter as my oath of office requires me to do so."(548)   

<P>According to Mr. Keeney, Ms. Casey told him that she "would have to think about" recusal.(549)  Ms. Casey did not recall that she was considering recusing herself at the end of the conversation.(550)  Mr. Johnson opposed recusal by the office.(551)  Ms. Casey never contacted Mr. Keeney again to discuss the recusal matter.(552)

<P>  During the same September 20th conversation with Mr. Keeney, Ms. Casey "indicated that Coleman refused to make a proffer to the office in Little Rock because he didn't trust them."(553)  Accordingly, Mr. Keeney thus advised Ms. Casey to convey to Mr. Coleman that he could make the proffer to Main Justice.(554)  Mr. Gangloff similarly testified that he understood that Ms. Casey would send a letter to Mr. Coleman to inform him that he had "recourse to Washington" and could make a proffer to Main Justice; he recalled "detailed discussions" about ensuring that Mr. Coleman knew about this option.(555) 

<P>Ms. Casey did not recall any such request by Mr. Keeney.  Although Ms. Casey did not dispute Mr. Keeney's recollection, she claimed that Mr. Keeney may have directed Mr. Johnson, not her, to relay this information to Mr. Coleman.(556)  Mr. Johnson also believed that Mr. Keeney may have suggested that he advise Mr. Coleman of Mr. Hale's recourse to Main Justice.

<P>Neither Ms. Casey nor Mr. Johnson followed Mr. Keeney's direction to inform Mr. Coleman that he had the option of dealing with Main Justice.  None of the letters that Ms. Casey or Mr. Johnson sent to Mr. Coleman on September 20 or 21, 1993 advised Mr. Coleman that he could contact directly Main Justice if he did not trust the U.S. Attorney's Office.(557)

<P>Ms. Casey and Mr. Johnson both admitted that they did not convey Mr. Keeney's message to Mr. Coleman.(558)  Mr. Coleman similarly testified that no one from the U.S. Attorney's Office ever informed him that he could speak to someone at Main Justice.(559)

<P>On September 23, 1993, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette published Hale's allegations involving President Clinton, Mr. McDougal and Governor Tucker.(560)  That same day, the grand jury indicted Mr. Hale on two counts of conspiracy and two counts relating to the submission of false statements to the SBA.(561)

<P>C.<P>Ms. Casey's declination of Criminal Referral C0004. 



<P>Even after her September 20, 1993 discussion with Mr. Keeney, Ms. Casey continued to participate actively in the Hale and Madison Guaranty investigations.  By August 20, 1993, the FBI Little Rock Field Office had opened an investigation of Mr. McDougal and Mr. Hale as a result of information developed during the investigation of Mr. Hale.(562)  In July or August of 1993, an investigation was launched involving Dean Paul, Ltd. and Castle Grande and touching on Madison Guaranty and Mr. McDougal.(563)

<P>On September 24, 1993, only four days after Mr. Keeney advised Ms. Casey to recuse herself, FBI agents met with Ms. Casey to discuss the investigation of Madison Guaranty and Mr. Hale, as well as whether Ms. Casey should recuse herself from these matters because of her close ties to Governor Tucker, Seth Ward and Stephen Smith.(564)   According to SSA Irons, he and Mr. Jackson told Ms. Casey that her "good friends" were either subjects or material witnesses of the ongoing investigations.(565)  Ms. Casey admitted that they discussed allegations involving President Clinton and the McDougals.(566)  SSA Irons indicated in a memorandum, memorializing the meeting, that Ms. Casey stated that she would need to recuse herself from the matter because of her close friendship with Governor Tucker, Mr. Ward and Mr. Smith.(567)

<P>Ms. Casey agreed with SSA Irons' account except with respect to Mr. Ward.  She testified, "I told them that if the investigations led to Governor Tucker, that I would recuse.  I don't know Seth Ward.  I am an acquaintance of Steve Smith's."(568)

<P>Yet, once again, Ms. Casey did not provide the Special Committee with any real reason for her sudden change of mind regarding her recusal.  Ms. Casey claimed that at the time of this meeting, she "realized" that the investigation had progressed to a point that "there was a real" possibility that Governor Tucker would become a subject of the investigation.(569)  Ms. Casey claimed that even though she knew that she had to recuse herself, she still had to decide the "best time" to do so.(570)  Mr. Johnson continued to urge Ms. Casey against recusal.(571)

<P>For some unknown reason, despite her conversation with Mr. Keeney only four days before, Ms. Casey did not advise officials at Main Justice that she had changed her position on recusal.(572) 

<P>In addition, on October 5, 1993, after a briefing on the Hale investigation, the Director of the FBI indicated to senior FBI officials that he wanted Ms. Casey to recuse herself.(573)

<P>For the balance of September and October, Ms. Casey took no steps to recuse herself from the Hale or Madison investigations or her office.(574)  Rather, Ms. Casey continued to participate in the investigation and, amazingly, even attended a plea negotiation meeting with Mr. Coleman on October 21, 1993.(575)  Mr. Keeney testified that once Ms. Casey had decided to recuse herself, "she should not be making any decisions with respect to the matter." (576)   Thus, as of September 24, 1993, Ms. Casey should not have participated in any way in the Hale and Madison investigations.  

<P>When pressed about her continued involvement in such matters, Ms. Casey claimed that even though she "knew I was going to recuse myself," she still wanted to wait for the receipt of the new referrals.  She explained: "If there was a case against -- if there was a case against Tucker or Steve Smith, that's what I was going to do.  And I expected those referrals to give me that."(577)

<P>On October 8, 1993, the RTC forwarded nine new criminal referrals concerning Madison Guaranty to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Little Rock.(578)  Ms. Casey reviewed the second set of referrals.(579)  According to Ms. Casey, "when the referrals came in, I probably talked with Michael again about the fact that they were there, that the names were there and I needed to recuse."(580)  Mr. Johnson still advised Ms. Casey not to recuse herself from the case.(581)

<P>Again, Ms. Casey did not contact any official at Main Justice either to notify them that Governor Tucker was a target of an investigation or to inform them of her "recusal."(582)  Ms. Casey offered no coherent reason for not advising Main Justice immediately, claiming only, "I was waiting to talk--I was going to the orientation in November.  I wanted to talk to someone at the Department of Justice whose opinion I could also trust."(583)  

<P>In September and October 1993, while Main Justice and FBI were urging Ms. Casey to recuse herself, the Little Rock U.S. Attorney's Office took no action on the first RTC Referral, number C0004.  Ms. Casey testified that when she first read Criminal Referral C0004 in late August or September of 1993, she probably noticed Governor Tucker, Mr. McDougal and President Clinton were mentioned.  But, the only action she took was to place the referral back into "the vault."(584)

<P>On October 27, 1993 -- over a year after the RTC had sent the referral to the U.S. Attorney's Office and at least two months after she first read it -- Ms. Casey formally declined prosecution on Criminal Referral C0004.(585)  It is unclear why Ms. Casey believed that it was appropriate for her to make a substantive decision on the referral when she knew that she was going to recuse herself.  Mr. Keeney testified that issuing the declination letter was a "substantive decision" that someone who supposedly had recused herself from the case should not have made.(586)

<P>Ms. Casey could not explain why she did not defer action on the first referral until after she had recused herself from the new set of referrals -- which either had already arrived at the U.S. Attorney's Office or would arrive shortly thereafter: "It was just a question of closing the books on the particular referral.  Because, in my opinion, the books had already been closed on it.  It was just a matter of relating that decision to the RTC."(587)  

<P>Even more peculiar, Ms. Casey's declination letter gave the impression that Main Justice had decided to decline the referral: "I concur with the opinion of the Department attorneys (emphasis added) that there is insufficient information in the referral to sustain many of the allegations made by the investigators or to warrant the initiation of a criminal investigation." (588)  In fact, Main Justice had not made any decision on the referral, but had returned it to the Little Rock office.  

<P>When confronted with the fact that she reviewed the March 19, 1993 memorandum from Mr. Keeney to Mr. Frazier prior to sending the declination letter, Ms. Casey admitted that she made the "decision" to decline prosecution on the referral.(589)43   Mr. Carver, Principal Deputy Chief of Fraud Section, Criminal Division, was "amazed" when he read a press article stating "Paula Casey didn't participate in the decision making with regard to C0004" because he knew she had been involved in the decision to decline the referral.(590)  Moreover, Justice Department officials testified that the referral was returned to the U.S. Attorney's Office earlier in 1993 for a decision, (591) and that Main Justice never reviewed the declination letter before Ms. Casey sent it.(592)

<P>Neither Ms. Casey nor Mr. Johnson, her First Assistant, ever reviewed the exhibits to the referral prior to declining prosecution.(593)  Mr. Carver believed that Ms. Casey should have conducted an independent review of the evidence prior to declining Criminal Referral C0004. 

<P>As of early November 1993, as Main Justice was "vigorously" pursuing allegations about Mr. Hale, the McDougals and Mr. Ward(594), Ms. Casey still had not contacted Main Justice about her recusal.  

<P>On November 3, 1993, Philip Heymann, Deputy Attorney General, called Ms. Casey to a meeting with other high ranking DOJ officials for the purpose of persuading Ms. Casey that she should recuse herself.(595)  Mr. Heymann told Ms. Casey that she should recuse herself.  This view was expressed by all Justice Department officials in attendance.(596)

<P>Even though Ms. Casey earlier explained that her reason for not recusing herself immediately after reviewing the second set of referrals was that she needed to receive advice from a Justice Department official whom she could trust, Ms. Casey told Mr. Heymann that she would "think it over" and get back to them.(597)  As of the end of the meeting, Ms. Casey still had not committed to recusal.(598)

<P>Thus, notwithstanding the advice of the Deputy Attorney General and other high-ranking Justice Department officials, Ms. Casey still waited another two days before she finally recused herself on November 5, 1993.(599)  

<P>On November 9, 1993, the day after Ms. Casey's formal recusal, Mr. Keeney announced that Donald Mackay, a career prosecutor for the Justice Department, would lead the investigation of Mr. Hale and Madison Guaranty.(600)  Mr. Mackay subsequently entered into plea negotiations with David Hale.(601)  On January 3, 1993, Mr. Mackay sent a letter to Mr. Coleman outlining what the Justice Department would require as the terms of a proffer agreement.(602)  After Special Counsel Fiske was appointed in January 1994, he entered into negotiations with Mr. Hale, and Mr. Hale entered a plea agreement on March 19, 1994.(603)

    <H2> PART II: WHITE HOUSE INTERVENTION IN FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS</H2>

<P>Throughout the conduct of the various inquiries relating to Whitewater, Madison, and other matters relating to the Clintons, the White House engaged in a clearly discernible pattern of improper contacts, undue interference and, at times, outright obstruction with respect to the federal investigations. 

<P>The pattern of abuse began with attempts to use the resources of the White House, especially the White House Counsel's Office, to gather as much information as possible on the pending investigations.  The Office of the White House Counsel, in effect, served as Clintons' private law firm defending their personal interests.  Beyond the impropriety of such diversion of public resources, attempts by White House lawyers to obtain information compromised the integrity of the federal investigations.  

<P>The interests of the United States with respect to these investigations were potentially adverse to the private interests of the Clintons as witnesses or potential targets.  Yet, whenever possible, White House lawyers obtained confidential information relating to the progress of the investigations and prospects for prosecution.  The White House lawyers not only used the information to defend the private interests of the Clintons, but also shared the improperly obtained confidential information with the Clintons' private lawyers directly to assist in the coordinated defense effort.

I.<P>White House Contacts Relating to Investigations of Madison and David Hale.



<P>A.<P>The White House receives information on the ongoing SBA investigation of Mr. Hale.

<P>In early May 1993, SBA Associate Administrator Wayne Foren, a career SBA employee, contacted Erskine Bowles, President Clinton's nominee for SBA Administrator, to discuss the agency's ongoing investigation of Capital Management Services and David Hale.(604)  According to Mr. Foren, he called Mr. Bowles on May 3, 4 or 5 -- right before Mr. Bowles' confirmation.(605)  Mr. Foren contacted Mr. Bowles because Mr. Hale, the president of CMS, had claimed to have access to President Clinton, Governor Jim Guy Tucker, and Arkansas Senator Dale Bumpers, then the chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee.(606)

<P>Mr. Foren realized the sensitivity of the matter and, accordingly, concluded that the only means to answer questions he had about the operations of CMS was to make "a referral to the Office of the Inspector General so that they could proceed on an investigation and in an attempt to obtain the information."(607)  According to Mr. Foren, "[k]nowing that Erskine's confirmation hearing was imminent, I felt it was appropriate that he be briefed on this issue."(608)  After Mr. Foren told Mr. Bowles about the case, Mr. Bowles "agreed that the transfer [of the case to the Inspector General] should occur prior to the confirmation and that he wanted a briefing paper."(609)  Mr. Foren referred the matter to the Inspector General on May 5, 1993.(610)

<P>At Mr. Bowles' instruction, Mr. Foren then prepared a briefing paper entitled "Capital Management Services, Inc, Little Rock, Arkansas, License No. 06/06-5207."(611)  The document outlined David Hale's 1992 application for additional funds from the SBA and stated that the value of the donated assets Mr. Hale used to justify additional funds from the SBA was "questionable."(612)  The briefing paper noted that "the matter has been referred to the Inspector General for investigation."(613)  Mr. Foren provided the briefing paper to Kris Swedin, the SBA's Assistant Administrator for Congressional Relations.(614)  In Mr. Foren's view, the Hale investigation was "very sensitive" and "very important."(615)

<P>On May 7, 1993, Mr. Bowles was confirmed as SBA Administrator.(616)  After Mr. Bowles' confirmation, Mr. Bowles advised Mr. Foren that he had briefed White House Chief of Staff, Thomas "Mack" McLarty, a longtime friend of the President, on the status of the CMS case.(617)  Mr. Foren advised his deputy, Charles Shepperson, of Mr. Bowles' communication of information to Mr. McLarty.(618)  Mr. Shepperson confirmed this account:

<P>My recollection was that Wayne had come back from a meeting with Mr. Bowles on a subject I can't remember, he had come back and said that Erskine had taken him aside and indicated that he had spoken to Mr. McLarty, and that Mr. McLarty had indicated that we should just do what you normally do in situations like this.(619)

<P>Mr. Bowles testified that he could not specifically deny Mr. Foren's and Mr. Shepperson's account, although Mr. Bowles could not recall Mr. Foren briefing him on CMS in May 1993.(620)  He recalled that Mr. Foren and others briefed him at the Old Executive Office Building on SBA programs; he was not certain of the date, but believed that the briefing did not occur between May 4 and May 7.(621)  He remembered at some point being told that the Hale/CMS matter had been referred to the Inspector General or the Justice Department.(622)  He did not recall seeing the briefing paper that Mr. Foren used to brief him in May 1993.(623)

<P>In addition, Mr. Bowles did not recall advising Mr. Foren that he had spoken with Mr. McLarty about the CMS referral.(624)  Mr. Bowles recalled, however, that he saw Mr. McLarty on the morning of his confirmation hearing, when he visited the White House.(625)  Indeed, Mr. McLarty's schedule for May 6, 1993, contained the following entry:  "Erskine Bowles & his family will be touring the West Wing and will be stopping in very briefly to say hello some time around 8:45-9:00 a.m."(626)

<P>More important, Mr. Bowles saw Mr. McLarty on May 7, 1993, the date of his confirmation.  According to Mr. Bowles, "I saw Mack again, I believe on the 7th, the day I was actually confirmed by the Senate.  And at that time, I went over there to get my marching orders, how should I go forward, how should I report, what do I do."(627)  Mr. McLarty's schedule for May 7, 1993 confirmed that, at 1:00 p.m., he had a meeting with Mr. Bowles.(628)  Yet, Mr. Bowles denied that he discussed not discuss CMS with Mr. McLarty.  "I don't believe I've ever discussed Capital Management with Mack McLarty."(629)

<P>On May 19, 1993, Mr. Foren again briefed Mr. Bowles on CMS, when the SBA initiated foreclosure and liquidation proceedings against Capital Management.(630)  According to Mr. Foren, "[t]he event that occurred between the 5th and the 19th was an event where Capital Management defaulted on debentures, and we were then going to proceed to foreclose collateral and throw the company into liquidation."(631)  Mr. Foren provided Mr. Bowles with a revised version of his earlier briefing paper, entitled "Capital Management Services, Inc, Little Rock, Arkansas, License No. 06/06-5207, May 19, 1993."(632)

<P>On August 5, 1993, Mr. Shepperson received a copy of a draft indictment of Mr. Hale from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Little Rock.(633)  He sent the draft indictment to Mr. Foren.(634)  On August 9, Mr. Foren sent yet another memorandum to Mr. Bowles on the progress of the investigation and attached a copy of the draft indictment to the memorandum.(635)  The memorandum, designated "Privileged and Confidential," was signed by Mr. Foren and Deputy General Counsel Martin D. Teckler and addressed to Erskine Bowles.(636)

<P>Mr. Bowles did not recall receiving Mr. Foren's August 9 memorandum,(637) although "Wayne very well could have sent it to me."(638)

<P>In September 1993, Mr. Foren provided another briefing to Mr. Bowles about the Hale/CMS investigation, this time to advise him that Mr. Hale's indictment was imminent.(639)  Mr. Foren also provided Mr. Bowles with a memorandum,(640) dated September 21, 1993, advising that on September 20, 1993, the SBA had closed CMS's bank accounts and seized its assets.(641)  The memorandum further advised that the U.S. Attorney's office is "scheduled to make a presentation to the Grand Jury on Tuesday, September 21, 1993, at 3:00 p.m. and [is] expecting indictments to be returned on Tuesday or Wednesday, September 21 or September 22, 1993 against Judge Hale and two other individuals."(642)

<P>Mr. Bowles did not recall receiving multiple briefings or memoranda from Mr. Foren on the Hale/CMS investigation, although he admitted to receiving the May 1993 briefing and a later briefing by Martin Teckler, the Deputy General Counsel of the SBA.(643)  According to Mr. Bowles, in September 1993, Mr. Teckler "told me that we were getting ready to indict Judge Hale down in Arkansas for defrauding the SBA, and said that I might want to call the White House and give them a heads-up."(644)  Mr. Bowles asked Mr. Teckler to describe a "heads-up,"(645)  and Mr. Teckler told him "it was simply notification in case they got some inquiries."(646)  Mr. Bowles claimed that he questioned the propriety of such notification, and Mr. Teckler replied that "it was standard."(647)  Although Mr. Bowles told Mr. Teckler he would give a "heads up" to the White House, Mr. Bowles maintained that he never called the "White House" about the case.  He explained:

<P>I was often asked to take things to the White House.  I often said I'll take care of it.  Sometimes I felt the right way to take care of it was to throw it in the trash can.  Sometimes it was to call somebody lower down.  Sometimes it was to call somebody higher up.  Sometimes I did it, sometimes I didn't.  I just made a judgment.(648)



<P>In November 1993, Mr. Bowles claimed that he learned from news accounts that Mr. Hale alleged that, in 1986, then-Governor Clinton had pressured Mr. Hale into making an illegal SBA loan to Susan McDougal.(649)  After hearing of this allegation, Mr. Bowles decided to recuse himself from the case.  He communicated this decision orally to General Counsel John Spotila, but did not memorialize his recusal in writing until months later, on March 3, 1994.(650)  In fact, Mr. Spotila continued to provide Mr. Bowles with information concerning the Hale/CMS investigation in the weekly SBA Administrator's report through June 27, 1994, more than six months after Mr. Bowles purportedly decided to recuse himself from the CMS/Hale matter.(651)

<P>On April 11, 1994, Mr. Bowles responded to an inquiry by Congresswoman Jan Meyers, then the Ranking Member of the House Committee on Small Business, about his recusal from the CMS investigation.(652)  Mr. Bowles advised that he had verbally recused himself from the matter in late fall 1993, and had memorialized this decision in writing on March 4, 1994.(653)  Mr. Bowles specifically claimed: "I have never reviewed the Capital Management file."(654)  The assertion was contradicted by Mr. Bowles' own admission that he was occasionally briefed on the CMS/Hale investigation.(655)  Mr. Foren believed that Mr. Bowles, as a practical matter, was knowledgeable about what was in the file.(656)  When asked about the seeming discrepancy between his letter to Congresswoman Meyers and his testimony, Mr. Bowles maintained that his statement to Congresswoman Meyers was accurate: "I hadn't reviewed the file.  I hadn't studied the file.  I hadn't spent a long time going over it."(657)

<P>B.<P>Mr. Hale's lawyers contact the White House about Mr. Hale's "mutual interest" with President Clinton.

<P>On August 20, 1993, the Little Rock Field Office notified FBI Headquarters that the RTC planned to submit new referrals on Madison Guaranty.(658)  Special Agent Steven Irons advised Headquarters that "Assistant United States Attorney assigned to the matter reported being told a Little Rock Attorney had traveled to Washington instant date to meet with unknown officials to attempt to have the investigation quashed." (659)  Mr. Irons testified that Fletcher Jackson told him that Richard Mayes, a Little Rock attorney had traveled to Washington to get the Hale investigation quashed.(660)  Mr. Irons advised FBI Headquarters to "be alert if someone within the Department asked some questions about the Hale case or the upcoming Madison referrals," and in particular a close associate of President Clinton, Webster Hubbell, now the third highest official in the Department.(661)   

<P>Mr. Hubbell had lunch or dinner with Mr. Mayes once or twice between January and September 1993.(662)  Mr. Mayes denied that he talked to Mr. Hubbell about the David Hale investigation or indictment.(663)

<P>On August 17, 1993, in the middle of the SBA's and the Justice Department's investigations into Capital Management and David Hale, Randy Coleman, Mr. Hale's attorney, called Associate Counsel to the President William Kennedy to advise the White House that the ongoing federal investigations might pose problems for President Clinton.(664)  Mr. Coleman told Mr. Kennedy that he wanted to talk about "the mutual interests of our clients."(665)

<P>  The conversation was brief.(666)  Mr. Coleman told Mr. Kennedy that the FBI had raided Mr. Hale's CMS office and confiscated records containing information on the Clintons, Governor Tucker, the McDougals, Whitewater and Madison.(667)  Mr. Coleman told Mr. Kennedy that if Heidi Fleiss was the "madam to the stars, David Hale was the lender to the political elite in Arkansas."(668) 

<P>Mr. Kennedy's notes indicate that Mr. Coleman mentioned President Clinton and Governor Tucker.44  

<P>Mr. Kennedy was familiar with Madison and Whitewater from his work at Rose Law Firm and from his understanding of the Clintons' circle of friends.(669)

<P>Mr. Coleman and Mr. Kennedy had different recollections of the conclusion of the conversation.  Mr. Coleman testified that after outlining some of the names contained in Mr. Hale's files,(670) he informed Mr. Kennedy that he would be meeting with SBA officials in Washington, D.C., the next week and could also meet with Mr. Kennedy to discuss the matter further.(671)  According to Mr. Coleman, Mr. Kennedy then asked him whether there was anything that he wanted him to do.(672)  Mr. Coleman responded, "I said I'm just trying to figure out where everybody is on this matter, and he said that he would visit with his clients and get back to me.(673)

<P>Mr. Coleman did not expect Mr. Kennedy to do anything "helpful" for Mr. Hale.(674)  Instead, Mr. Coleman contacted Mr. Kennedy because the investigation might involve "folks other than just my client, and where that was the case it was always my habit to start making contact with attorneys for other people who might be involved to see where everybody stood and what the landscape looked like."(675)  Mr. Coleman also believed that he might be able to confirm Mr. Hale's suspicion that "there were some folks in the executive branch that wouldn't be, oh, looking out for his best interests."(676)  Mr. Coleman wanted to make a "provocative phone" call because White House officials "had shown a propensity to make an ill-advised phone call or two in times past." (677)

<P>Mr. Kennedy had a different recollection of key elements of the phone call.  First, he denied offering to do anything for Mr. Coleman.(678)  Instead, he claimed that he was "uncomfortable" talking to Mr. Coleman because he thought that Mr. Coleman might be seeking improper involvement on the part of the White House.(679)  Mr. Kennedy said that "I told him I wasn't sure I could talk to him, but I would inquire and get back to him."(680)

<P>The last entry in Mr. Kennedy's notes of the telephone call, however, appears to corroborate Mr. Coleman's testimony: "*Ask for anything."(681)  Mr. Kennedy claimed that he did not know what he meant by this entry.(682)  Mr. Kennedy's notes do not indicate that Mr. Coleman was "looking" for something or expected Mr. Kennedy to do something "helpful" for Mr. Hale.(683)

<P>Second, Mr. Kennedy denied saying that he had to get back to his "clients" -- presumably President and Mrs. Clinton.(684)  But Mr. Coleman vividly remembered that Mr. Kennedy said "clients" in the plural because the reference struck him as odd since the entire discussion up to that point had been in terms of their respective individual clients.(685)

<P>After the telephone call, Mr. Kennedy spoke to Mr. Nussbaum.(686)  Mr. Kennedy claimed that he was concerned that it would be inappropriate for him to engage in any substantive discussion with Mr. Coleman.(687)  Mr. Nussbaum agreed,(688) and instructed Mr. Kennedy to tell Mr. Coleman that the White House could not help him -- but, somewhat inconsistently, also to find out "a little more about what was going on."(689)

<P>Two days later, on August 19, 1993, Mr. Kennedy contacted Mr. Coleman.(690)  Mr. Kennedy asked Associate White House Counsel Beth Nolan to listen to the conversation.(691)  According to Mr. Coleman, this conversation lasted five or ten minutes.(692)  Mr. Coleman testified that Mr. Kennedy wanted to know more specific information about the investigation.(693)  Mr. Coleman recalled that Mr. Kennedy particularly wanted to know whether Mr. Hale was trying to "negotiate" with the U.S. Attorney's Office(694) and would allege any "face-to-face meetings" with the President.(695)

<P>Mr. Kennedy claimed that he essentially told Mr. Coleman at the beginning of the call that he could not assist him.(696)<P>

<P>But Mr. Kennedy's and Ms. Nolan's respective notes of the conversation clearly indicate that Mr. Kennedy was "engaged in a discussion during which [Kennedy] asked [Coleman] a series of questions including, among other things, what was the anticipation of what David Hale would be charged with, where was this going to go, a conversation in which among other names mentioned were Whitewater Development and Jim Guy Tucker with which were familiar."(697)  Mr. Kennedy also admitted that he sought to obtain information about the extent to which Mr. Hale was connected to Madison.(698)

<P>The notes of Ms. Nolan and Mr. Kennedy both indicate that Madison and Whitewater were discussed in detail.(699)  Mr. Kennedy's notes appear as the following: 

<P>"Nature of Investigation - propriety of loans made 

<P><P><P><P>  past few years 



<P>     Informed that are loan transactions that relate <BR>

     to Madison Guaranty<BR></P>



<P>     All records liquidation of SBIC<BR>

          Both of them's names cropped up <BR></P>



<P>     Whitewater Development Corp.: not stopping <BR>

                         w/ David Hale <BR></P>



<P>     Xactions:   Southloop<BR>

              Castle Grande Water."(700) <BR></P>



Mr. Kennedy claimed that he did not know at the time that Southloop and Castle Grande were Tucker real estate projects financed by Madison.(701)  Ms. Nolan's notes also indicate that Mr. Kennedy asked Mr. Coleman whether bad loans were "parked" at Madison:

<P>BK: You mean Madison have parked bad loans w/ David?

<P>RC: Yep. You bet .... The Madison deal is coming back to life.(702)



Ms. Nolan's notes indicate that Mr. Coleman told Mr. Kennedy that "they're not stopping at Whitewater, I can guarantee you that." (703)

<P>Mr. Kennedy offered no explanation for his returned call to Mr. Coleman other than to admit that he sought "to know a little bit more before" he definitively could decide the propriety of other discussions.(704)  Mr. Kennedy explained, "I didn't think we would be able to help him, but I couldn't respond sort of fully until I knew a little bit more about what he was talking about, and he opened up a little bit."(705)

<P>Although Mr. Kennedy claimed that he did not ask Mr. Coleman about plea negotiations or whether Mr. Hale would allege any "face-to-face meetings" with President Clinton,(706)  Ms. Nolan's notes indicate that the U.S. Attorney's office is "going to know about mtgs. taking place."(707)  

<P>Mr. Kennedy's notes indicate that he discussed the President and Mrs. Clinton with Mr. Coleman: "All records liquidation w/SBIC [arrow] both of them's names cropped up Whitewater Development Corp.: Not stopping w/David Hale."(708)  Ms. Nolan's notes also contain the following entry: "your C's name has cropped up [arrow] both of 'em, Whitewater Develop. Corp."(709)  Mr. Kennedy denied that "both" refers to the President and Mrs. Clinton.(710)

<P>Ms. Nolan's notes specifically indicate that at the end of the conversation Mr. Kennedy thanked Mr. Coleman for the "head's up."(711)

<P>After the second telephone conversation, Mr. Kennedy again briefed Mr. Nussbaum.(712)  Mr. Kennedy claimed that he told Mr. Nussbaum that he had never heard of "the stuff" in connection with Whitewater during the campaign and that, as a result, Hale's allegations were not credible.(713)  Mr. Kennedy claimed that he did nothing other than to report Mr. Coleman's information to Mr. Nussbaum.(714)  Mr. Kennedy maintained that Mr. Nussbaum took no further action.(715)  Mr. Kennedy denied that he ever told President Clinton or Mrs. Clinton or anyone else at the White House.(716) 

<P>Bruce Lindsey, then Director of Presidential Personnel, claimed that he first learned of Mr. Kennedy's conversations with Mr. Coleman from New York Times reporter Jeff Gerth.(717)  Mr. Lindsey then sought confirmation,(718) and Mr. Kennedy told Mr. Lindsey that Mr. Coleman had told him that he "had a client who had mutual interests" and suggested that they discuss the matter.(719)  Mr. Lindsey understood the "client" to be President Clinton.(720)

<P>C.<P>The White House obtains more information about the Hale investigation.

<P>In late August or early September, Mr. Kennedy advised then-Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell of the Coleman phone call.(721)  Mr. Hubbell's phone log indicates he had a ten-minute conversation with Mr. Kennedy on August 18th.(722)  According to Mr. Hubbell, Mr. Kennedy wanted to know whether he had learned of any connection between Mr. Hale and Madison and James McDougal.(723)  Mr. Hubbell mistakenly told Mr. Kennedy there was no connection; Mr. Hubbell later remembered that he had become aware of such a connection in the course of representing the RTC in litigation against Madison's former accountants.(724)

<P>Mr. Kennedy claimed that in the course of a conversation with Mr. Hubbell about another matter, "I simply asked him had he heard the name David Hale in connection with Whitewater, and he said no, and that was the sum and source of it."(725)  Mr. Kennedy claimed that he asked Mr. Hubbell about the Hale matter because he knew that Mr. Hubbell was familiar with the Whitewater issue from the 1992 presidential campaign.(726)45 

<P>On September 20, 1993, Jeff Gerth met with Senior White House officials Bruce Lindsey and Mark Gearan, and conveyed the same information.(727)  Mr. Gerth told Mr. Lindsey and Mr. Gearan that Mr. Hale alleged that he had three meetings with then-Governor Clinton in 1985 and 1986.  According to Mr. Gerth, prior to meeting with Governor Clinton, Mr. Hale had several meetings with Mr. Tucker and Mr. McDougal.(728)  Mr. McDougal told Mr. Hale that Madison Guaranty was strapped for cash and scheduled to be audited, and that "friends in the political family needed help."(729)

<P>At the first meeting, on the steps of the Arkansas Capitol, Governor Clinton allegedly approached Mr. Hale and said something like "are you going to be able to help Jim and I out? . . . I would really appreciate it."(730) 

<P>The second meeting allegedly took place at Mr. McDougal's trailer office at the Castle Grande land development.(731)  Governor Clinton, who was dressed in a jogging outfit, and Mr. McDougal asked Mr. Hale to make a loan from CMS to "clean up the books" at Madison Guaranty.(732)  Governor Clinton warned Mr. Hale that his name could not "show up anywhere," but that he might be able to provide security for the loan with some property in Marion County -- the county where Whitewater was located.(733)

<P>Mr. Gerth then explained that Mr. Hale subsequently made a $300,000 SBA loan to Susan McDougal d/b/a Master Marketing on April 3, 1986.(734)  Mr. Hale understood that some of the money would be advanced to Whitewater.  Indeed, records show that a portion of the proceeds from the loan was used by Whitewater to purchase land from International Paper Corporation in 1986.(735)  

<P>At the third meeting, then-Governor Clinton allegedly saw Mr. Hale at a Little Rock shopping mall and asked him "Have you heard what that f------ w---- Susan has done with the money?"(736)  Mr. Gearan and Mr. Lindsey both claimed that Mr. Gerth was the first to tell them of Mr. Hale's allegations against President Clinton.(737)  Both senior White House officials further asserted that they learned for the first time of Mr. Kennedy's telephone calls with Mr. Coleman a month earlier.(738)

<P>After the meeting with Mr. Gerth, Mr. Lindsey asked President Clinton about Mr. Hale's allegations.  The President denied that any of the meetings occurred.(739)

<P>On the same day, Mr. Lindsey called James Blair, the General Counsel of Tyson Food and a close associate of the President, twice to discuss Whitewater.(740)  Mr. Lindsey's contemporaneous notes of the first conversation indicate that Mr. Blair had previously contacted  Mr. Heuer, Mr. McDougal's attorney, to discuss whether Mr. McDougal would be implicated in any case against Mr. Hale.  Specifically, the notes indicate that Mr. Heuer "asked Brent Bumpers [Assistant United States Attorney for EDAR] ...whether indictment against Hale, not McDougal."(741)  Mr. Lindsey's notes of the second conversation shows: "Fletcher Jackson-in charge of case-immunity leaked. McDougal might become target. Blair Heard that $300,000 had been deposited in McDougal's account, jumped pretty high."(742)  Mr. Lindsey could not interpret these entries in his notes, and particularly the notation "jumped pretty high."(743)<P>    

<P>Mr. Blair had no recollection of speaking with Mr. Lindsey, but admitted that they may have discussed David Hale.(744)46   He also could not recall any conversation with Mr. Heuer about whether Mr. McDougal would be indicted along with Mr. Hale, but admitted "[t]hat's certainly a possibility.  I have discussed with Heuer at times whether McDougal was actually going to be reindicted after his first acquittal."(745)  When asked whether he relayed the results of any conversation with Mr. Heuer back to the White House or elsewhere, Mr. Blair carefully claimed, "I don't have any recollection of that.  I'm not saying if I didn't hear something interesting, I might not have passed it on to Bruce Lindsey, but I have no specific recollection of that."(746) 

<P>When asked about any conversation between Mr. Heuer and Assistant U.S. Attorney Bumpers about the indictment of Hale, Mr. Blair professed that he did not "know anything about any conversations between Mr. Heuer and Mr. Bumpers."(747)  Mr. Blair claimed that Mr. Lindsey's notes did not refresh his recollection.(748)

<P>Although Mr. Bumpers did not recall Mr. Heuer asking whether Mr. McDougal would be indicted with Mr. Hale,(749)  Mr. Bumpers may have had a brief conversation with another Assistant U.S. Attorney, Fletcher Jackson about Mr. Hale investigation prior to Mr. Hale's indictment.(750)  Mr. Bumpers also may have learned of the imminent indictment at a staff meeting.(751)<P> 

<P>The Special Committee was not able to depose Mr. Heuer because he was preparing for Mr. McDougal's criminal trial.  Messrs. Blair and Bumpers could neither confirm nor deny that any of these conversations occurred.  Mr. Lindsey's contemporaneous notes of his conversation with Mr. Blair immediately following Mr. Lindsey's conversation with Mr. Gerth about Mr. Hale's allegations against President Clinton indicate that Mr. Heuer received confidential information about the ongoing federal investigation of Mr. Hale, and that this confidential information was passed on to Mr. Blair and Mr. Lindsey.(752) 



After Treasury and RTC Officials improperly advised the White House about RTC Referrals mentioning President Clinton and Governor Tucker, President Clinton meets with Governor Tucker at the White House.

<P>Attempts by senior White House officials to gather information about investigations touching on the Clintons went beyond contacts with potentially adverse counsel (Mr. Coleman) or with close associates (Mr. Blair).  Senior White House officials undertook a concerted and highly improper effort to contact investigative agencies about the ongoing investigations into Madison and Whitewater.

<P>During the period when the submission of the additional RTC referrals on Madison prepared by Ms. Lewis was being held up by the "legal review" by the RTC's Professional Liability Section, the White House received advance information on these referrals.  At about the same time that the White House learned of Mr. Hale's allegations against President Clinton, on September 29, 1993, Jean Hanson, the General Counsel of the Department of Treasury, which oversaw the RTC and its investigations, informed White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum and Associate White House Counsel Clifford Sloan of the existence of several RTC referrals involving Madison, Whitewater, and the Clintons.(753)

<P>This improper transmittal of confidential RTC information to the White House violated clearly established RTC procedures.  In a June 17, 1993 memorandum to all RTC attorneys and investigative staff on the handling of criminal referrals, RTC Director of Investigations James Dudine wrote: "All criminal referrals are sensitive and must be handled with appropriate confidentiality and care."(754)  Mr. Dudine advised that criminal referrals derived from records of financial institutions are also subject to the restrictions of the Right to Financial Privacy Act, 12 U.S.C &#167;3412.(755)  William H. Roelle, the RTC Senior Vice President in charge of the Investigations Division,(756) testified that, based on his 25-years of experience with the FDIC and RTC, both the substance and the fact of a criminal referral are confidential.(757)  There is no exception for press inquiries.(758)

<P>The Treasury General Counsel, Jean Hanson, improperly conveyed the confidential RTC information about the Madison criminal referrals to the White House.(759)  Specifically, Ms. Hanson advised Mr. Nussbaum that the President and Mrs. Clinton were identified as possible witnesses to the suspected criminal activities described in the referrals.(760)  She further told Mr. Nussbaum that the referrals referenced possible improper campaign contributions from Madison to one of Mr. Clinton's gubernatorial campaigns.(761)  Mr. Nussbaum admitted that Ms. Hanson provided him with nonpublic information about the referrals.(762)

<P>The next day, on September 30, Ms. Hanson called Mr. Sloan to amplify on the confidential information she had provided to Mr. Nussbaum.(763)  Mr. Sloan's notes of this conversation recorded the following: 

<P><P>"9 referrals--allegations re: Fulbright--



               *  Jim Guy Tucker <BR>

               *  attempt to divert funds."(764)<BR>

Mr. Sloan's notes further stated that the charges of conspiracy to divert funds were the "most serious allegation[s],"(765) that the referrals named the Clinton 1985 campaign as "co-conspirators,"(766) and, most important, that the "Clintons [were] mentioned in other charges as potential witnesses."(767)

<P>Mr. Nussbaum instructed Mr. Sloan to relay Ms. Hanson's information to then-Director of Presidential Personnel Bruce Lindsey, who was not a member of the press office, but rather a "damage control" specialist.(768)  Mr. Sloan did so on the same day, September 30, or shortly thereafter.(769)  Inexplicably, Mr. Lindsey claimed that Mr. Sloan did not advise him that Governor Tucker was named in the referrals as a target.(770)  Instead, Mr. Lindsey asserted that he did not learn that Governor Tucker was mentioned in the referrals until October 7 or 8, 1993.(771)

<P>On October 4 or 5, 1993, Mr. Lindsey passed the confidential RTC information directly to the President.(772)  When asked about the President's response, Mr. Lindsey claimed implausibly that "it was certainly nothing other than just sort of, `hmmmmmmm.'"(773)

<P>Curiously, on October 6, 1993, President Clinton had a meeting at the White House with Governor Jim Guy Tucker.(774)  Former Deputy Assistant to the President Keith Mason testified that he attended this meeting,(775) which was held late in the afternoon and lasted 30 to 45 minutes.(776)  Mr. Mason asserted that no discussions occurred at the meeting about Whitewater, Madison or RTC criminal referrals.(777)  Prior to the meeting, Mr. Mason escorted Governor Tucker to the office of White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty.(778)  Mr. Mason was present during part, but not all, of a meeting between Governor Tucker and Mr. McLarty.(779)  Mr. Mason claimed that at least while he was present Governor Tucker and Mr. McLarty did not discuss Madison Guaranty, the RTC criminal referrals or Whitewater.(780)

<P>Although Mr. Lindsey testified that he did not know that the criminal referrals mentioned Governor Tucker as of October 6 and therefore did not pass this information onto the President, such information hardly would have been necessary.  Notes taken by Susan Thomases during the 1992 campaign indicate that President Clinton had clear knowledge of the link between Whitewater and Governor Tucker.  In notes taken of a February 22, 1992 conversation relating to Whitewater, Ms. Thomases wrote: 

<P><P>"Have Gerth call Tucker

<P><P>BC tell me to call Tucker"(781)

On March 9, 1992, Jeff Gerth of the New York Times wrote to Ms. Thomases seeking additional information for his article on Whitewater and Madison.  In the margin of the letter, Ms. Thomases had taken notes, apparently of a conversation with Bill Clinton.47   In one such note, next to Mr. Gerth's allegation that Mr. McDougal was subsidizing the Clintons' interest in the Whitewater investment, Ms. Thomases wrote: "Call Jim Guy Tucker."(782)  Tellingly, as of the date of Ms. Thomases' notes, there had been no public allegation suggesting any link between Mr. Tucker and Whitewater, Madison, or Mr. McDougal.

<P>The Special Committee did not obtain testimony from Governor Tucker because he, along with James and Susan McDougal, was a defendant in a federal criminal proceeding.  The Whitewater-related charges prosecuted by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr in the Tucker-McDougal trial stemmed directly from the RTC criminal referrals prepared by Ms. Lewis--the substance of which was conveyed from Ms. Hanson, through Mr. Sloan and Mr. Lindsey, to President Clinton.  On May 28, 1996, an Arkansas jury convicted Governor Tucker of conspiracy and mail fraud in connection with transactions involving Mr. McDougal and Mr. Hale; President Clinton testified as a defense witness in the trial.(783)

<P>On October 8, 1993, the RTC Professional Liability Section completed its legal review of the criminal referrals.(784)  On the same day, the criminal referrals were transmitted to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Little Rock without any change from their original versions prepared by Ms. Lewis.(785)<P>

<P>On October 14, 1993, senior White House officials met again in Mr. Nussbaum's office with senior officials from the Department of Treasury to discuss the criminal referrals.(786)  Mr. Lindsey, Mr. Nussbaum, Mr. Sloan, Associate White House Counsel Neil Eggleston and White House Director of Communications Mark Gearan met with Ms. Hanson, Department of Treasury Chief of Staff Joshua Steiner and Assistant Secretary of Treasury for Public Affairs Jack DeVore.(787)  Mr. Devore testified that it "appear[ed] that someone in either Nussbaum's or Hanson's office called my secretary and asked her to schedule this meeting."(788)  During the meeting, Mr. DeVore explained to the group that he had received press inquiries about the criminal referrals, and a detailed description of the criminal referrals ensued.  In a memorandum to file, entitled "Whitewater Development Corporation,"(789) Mr. Lindsey indicated that one of the referrals "involved four cashiers checks -- each for $3,000, two made payable to the Clinton for Governor Campaign and two made payable to Bill Clinton."(790)  Mr. Lindsey further wrote that "DeVore confirmed with the RTC that the referrals had been received in the Washington office, but had already forwarded on to the Little Rock U.S. Attorney's office."(791)



III.<P>A Pivotal Event: The November 5, 1993 Meeting Between White House Officials and the Clintons' Private Lawyers.

<P>November 5, 1993, armed with details of the confidential RTC criminal referrals and Mr. Hale's allegations against President Clinton, senior White House officials met with the Clintons' private lawyers.  The stated purpose of this meeting was "to impart information to the Clinton's personal lawyers."(792)  The White House officials in attendance were Mr. Eggleston, Mr. Lindsey, Mr. Nussbaum, and Associate White House Counsel William Kennedy.(793)  The private lawyers were David Kendall of Williams & Connolly, Little Rock attorney Steven Engstrom, and James Lyons, the author of the Clinton campaign's 1992 Whitewater report.(794)  According to Mr. Lindsey, who characterized the gathering as a legal defense meeting, "[t]he purpose of the meeting was Whitewater Development Corporation."(795)  

<P>Mr. Kennedy's notes of the meeting, which the Committee obtained after a protracted dispute with the White House,(796) indicated that the White House officials provided the Clintons' private lawyers with much of the information they possessed concerning Whitewater, including confidential information relating to ongoing investigations by the SBA, RTC, and Justice Department.(797)  In essence, the White House officials used confidential information they gained by virtue of their positions of public trust to further the Clintons' private legal defense.

<P>A significant part of the discussion related to the ongoing RTC investigation of Madison.(798)  Among the principal topics of the meeting was the referral related to illegal contributions to Mr. Clinton's gubernatorial campaign.(799)48   Coincidentally, Mr. Lindsey, in his October 20 memorandum, appeared to be particularly concerned about one of the referrals, which "involved four cashier checks -- each for $3,000, two made payable to the Clinton for Governor Campaign and two made to Bill Clinton."  Mr. Kennedy claimed, however, that Mr. Lindsey indicated during the meeting that the source of the information was press accounts: "Basically, that Bruce is outlining, sort of the allegations, that the press was reporting wherein the referrals."(800)

<P>White House officials also discussed the fact that Governor Tucker was a target of the referrals.  In two separate entries, Mr. Kennedy wrote "Could be that JGT is target of RTC referral"(801) and "RTC-people trying to get BC and JGT."(802)  Mr. Lindsey testified that he first learned that Mr. Tucker was a target in the RTC investigation during the October 14 meeting with RTC officials: "I believe in the October 14th meeting that we had with certain people from the Treasury Department, that they indicated that Jeff Gerth had indicated that to them."(803)  Notes taken by Susan Thomases indicate, however, that at least President Clinton identified Mr. Tucker with Whitewater in February and March 1992.  In notes taken from a February 22, 1992 conversation relating to Whitewater, Ms. Thomases wrote: 

<P><P>"Have Gerth call Tucker

<P><P>BC tell me to call Tucker"(804)

Likewise, Ms. Thomases' notes, apparently of a conversation with then-Governor Clinton, taken on a March 9, 1992 letter from Mr. Gerth seeking information on Whitewater recorded: "Call Jim Guy Tucker."(805)  Mr. Tucker's ties to the McDougal and to Madison had not been publicized at the time.

<P>Another principal topic of discussion raised by Mr. Lindsey was Madison's retention of the Rose Law Firm and Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison in connection with Madison's proposal for a preferred stock offering.(806)49   Mr. Kennedy testified that Mr. Lindsey "[i]s giving history, and it's basically that she has given authority for Madison to do both things, and Bruce is talking about, you know, the perception about Beverly Bassett."(807)  Under "Beverly Basset," Mr. Kennedy wrote: "too much coziness."(808) 

<P>Although senior White House officials' claimed that they communicated only general background information concerning Whitewater and Madison during the November 5th meeting, Mr. Kennedy's notes detail the financing of the Clintons' investment in Whitewater.  Almost four pages of Mr. Kennedy's notes relate to the reconstruction of the Whitewater loans and transactions.(809)  The attendees were particularly interested, according to Mr. Kennedy's notes, in James Blair's involvement in the sale of the Clintons' interest in Whitewater in 1992,50  as well as Mr. Blair's possible involvement in Christopher Wade's payment of the outstanding bank loan on which the Clintons were guarantors.51   Mr. Blair had provided James McDougal with the $1000 to purchase the Clintons' Whitewater stock on December 22, 1992.(810)  The senior White House officials and the Clintons' private lawyers also discussed tax issues related to the Clintons' investment in Whitewater,52  and the chain of custody of certain Whitewater records that were used during the 1992 campaign to piece together specifics of the Clintons' investment.53 

<P>Curiously, a notation at the bottom of the first page of Mr. Kennedy's notes suggested a possible link between the FBI's investigation of CMS, which allegedly made an illegal loan to James and Susan McDougal in 1986 at the request of then-Governor Clinton, and the death of President Clinton's friend and counsel, Vincent Foster.  Mr. Kennedy wrote:

<P>"July 20th:<P>FBI issued subpena & took records of 

<P><P><P>municipal judge named Hale



<P><P><P>Also the day that VF killed himself 

<P><P><P>Factor"(811)

Mr. Kennedy claimed that "by factor" he meant: "Simply that the coincidence had become a factor in all of the intense speculation surrounding Vince's suicide."(812)

<P>The November 5th meeting also concerned "a division of labor between personal and White House counsel for handling future Whitewater issues."(813)

<P>In the middle of Mr. Kennedy's notes appears a cryptic reference to a remark by Mr. Kennedy that suggests the possibility of an effort to suppress critical evidence concerning Whitewater.(814)  Mr. Kennedy wrote: 

<P><P>"Vacuum    Rose law Files<P>WWDC Docs - subpoena<BR>

                 *Documents - never know go out  <BR>

                         Quietly(?)"(815) <BR><BR>

     Mr. Kennedy claimed to the Special Committee that "vacuum" was used in this meeting as a noun, not a verb:

<P>We were referring to at the meeting that there was an information vacuum, that when you tried [to] get your arms around Whitewater, in this case referring to the real estate investment, it is impossible to do.  The records were a shambles.  I had personal knowledge of that.  You are dealing with an information vacuum.  The Rose Law files, as they related to Whitewater documents, would--if you had gotten you hands on them, they would not have meant anything to you because of the condition of the records."(816)

<P>Mr. Kennedy denied that the entry "WWDC Docs - subpoena" reflected the concern of senior White House officials over the possibility that Whitewater records might be subpoenaed.(817)  Instead, Mr. Kennedy claimed:"The discussion was that if a subpoena were issued, files that had once been at the Rose Law Firm would no longer be there, with regard to Whitewater."(818)  Mr. Kennedy asserted that "*Documents - never go out/Quietly(?)" actually referred to the handling of Rose Law Firm files during the campaign: "It relates to the fact that there is--as far as I know, still is--a mystery about how the Whitewater documents--again I wish to stress these are the corporate records and real estate records relating to Whitewater as an investment--got from the Rose Law Firm to the campaign in 1992."(819)

<P>Regardless of whether "vacuum" is a verb or noun, records relating to Whitewater and Madison had been systematically removed from the Rose Law Firm during and after the 1992 campaign.  After questions arose about the Clintons' investment with the McDougals in Whitewater and Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison Guaranty before a state agency, Vincent Foster collected all the information he could on the Madison representation.  At the conclusion of the campaign, the Madison files, which were by now the property of the RTC as conservator of Madison, as well as the files of other Rose clients for whom Mrs. Clinton had performed legal services, were secretly removed from the firm by Webster Hubbell.  Mr. Hubbell removed these files, at times taking the firm's only copies,(820) without obtaining the consent of the firm or client.(821) 

<P>Also during the 1992 presidential campaign, Mr. Foster or Mr. Hubbell ordered the printing of billing records relating to the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison Guaranty.  These important records revealed the extent of Mrs. Clinton's legal work for Mr. McDougal's S&L, including her telephone call to Beverly Bassett Schaffer, the Arkansas Securities Commissioner appointed by Governor Clinton, about the troubled thrift's controversial proposal to raise capital by issuing preferred stock.  The records also reflected Mrs. Clinton's work on the IDC or Castle Grande transaction, which federal regulators described as a series of fraudulent land flips.(822)  The records contained the handwritten questions of Mr. Foster to Mrs. Clinton and notations by Mr. Hubbell.(823)  Mrs. Clinton has recently stated through her lawyer that she may have reviewed the records during the 1992 presidential campaign.

<P>After federal investigators began to look into matters relating to Madison Guaranty and Whitewater, a number of subpoenas were issued for these Rose Law Firm billing records.  By then, however, the records were nowhere to be found.  Despite extensive searches conducted by the law firm, neither the originals nor copies were discovered.(824)  They were not in the firm computers, its client files, or the firm's storage facility.(825)  The billing records, long lost, finally turned up in August 1995 in the Book Room of the White House Residence. 

<P>When asked about Mr. Foster's removal of documents from the Rose Law Firm, Mr. Kennedy admitted that he knew Mr. Foster had searched for Madison files during the 1992 campaign,(826) but claimed that he was not aware of whether Mr. Foster had removed the files from the Rose Law Firm.(827)  

<P>Mr. Kennedy also claimed that he wrote "quality," not "Quietly," in his notes, and was talking about the condition of "the Whitewater records that I once had in my possession, received from Ms. Clinton."(828)  Mr. Kennedy admitted that the Rose Law Firm did not have custody of any Whitewater documents, but claimed that, "The Whitewater files were Rose files when they were in my possession when I was performing legal work for Ms. Clinton."(829)

<P>Finally, Mr. Kennedy's notes recorded the following command: "Try to find out what's going on in Investigation,"(830) a directive that would inform the actions of White House officials throughout the Whitewater defense effort.



IV.<P>The White House Obtains Confidential SBA Documents Relating to Mr. Hale and Capital Management.

<P>At the November 5 meeting, senior White House officials and the Clintons' private lawyers discussed David Hale and his allegations against President Clinton.  For example, under the heading "David Hale," Mr. Kennedy's notes reflect the following notations: 

<P><P>"Tunnel at Capitol--Clinton says McD will call you--DH--hope 

<P><P>you'll help em



<P><P>145 Street Trailer - Jogging Shorts



<P><P>Shopping Malls - Clinton says do you know what bitch Susan 

<P><P>did with money-sed."(831)  

The notations reflect Mr. Hale's allegation that he saw then-Governor Clinton three times in 1986.  At the first meeting, on the steps of the Arkansas Capitol, Governor Clinton allegedly approached Mr. Hale and said that James McDougal would call Mr. Hale; Governor Clinton allegedly hoped that Mr. Hale would help Mr. McDougal.(832)  The second meeting allegedly took place at Mr. McDougal's trailer office on 145th Street in Little Rock.(833)  Governor Clinton, wearing a jogging outfit, asked Mr. Hale to make a loan to Mr. McDougal.  Finally, in the third meeting, at a Little Rock shopping mall, Governor Clinton, agitated, allegedly asked Mr. Hale: "Do you know what that bitch Susan did with the money?"(834)  Mr. Kennedy's notes recorded that: 

<P><P>"David Hale did make a $300,000 loan to Susan McD.  

<P><P>Jim McD says purchase land in Pulaski Co from IP 

<P><P>purchased in name of WW in 10/86."(835)  

<P>Three days after the November 5 Whitewater defense meeting, on November 8, Mr. Nussbaum directed Mr. Eggleston to a November 6 Washington Post story about a request from John LaFalce, Chairman of the House Committee on Small Business, to Mr. Bowles for information relating to CMS.54 (836)  The report, according to Mr. Eggleston, noted that Chairman LaFalce asked for the requested information by November 15, 1995.(837)

<P>Mr. Bowles responded to Chairman LaFalce's inquiry on November 15, 1993 in a four-page letter that provided a detailed summary of the investigation into CMS and responded to the specific questions set forth in Chairman LaFalce's November 4, 1993 letter.(838)  More importantly, Mr. Bowles' letter was accompanied by twelve sets of attachments, which included, among other things, lists of all loans provided by CMS, all portfolio financing reports submitted by CMS in connection with its SBA loans, all eleven reports of SBA audits of Capital Management, Mr. Foren's May 5, 1993 referral of the case to the Inspector General, and the September 23, 1993 criminal indictment against David Hale.(839)  In short, the attachments, "approximately a foot high,"(840) essentially comprised the entire SBA file on the operation, regulation, and investigation of CMS and David Hale.

<P>On the morning of November 16, 1993, the day after Mr. Bowles replied to Chairman LaFalce, Mr. Eggleston called the SBA and spoke with the Office of Legislative Affairs.(841)  The SBA directed Mr. Eggleston's inquiry to John Spotila, the SBA General Counsel.  Mr. Spotila advised that the SBA had responded to Chairman LaFalce's request late the night before.(842)  According to Mr. Eggleston, Mr. Spotila sent Mr. Eggleston via facsimile a copy of Mr. Bowles' letter to Chairman LaFalce at 11:20 a.m.(843)  Mr. Spotila followed up with another facsimile at 3:20 p.m., enclosing an SBA press release about Mr. Bowles' response.(844)  According to Mr. Eggleston, he then asked Mr. Spotila "whether it would be appropriate for the White House to have whatever had been provided to Congress."(845) 

<P>John Spotila was a classmate of President Clinton at Georgetown.  According to Mr. Spotila, "I have known the President for quite a while.  I was a classmate of his at Georgetown, and briefly at Yale, although my third year was his first year at the [law] school."(846)  He also knew Mrs. Clinton.(847)  Mr. Bowles testified that he selected Mr. Spotila as general counsel partly on Mrs. Clinton's recommendation.(848)

<P>On November 16, 1993, Mr. Spotila testified that he "faxed a copy of the press release that had been done and then the cover letter."(849)  After receiving the facsimiles, Mr. Eggleston asked Mr. Spotila whether he could have the attachments that accompanied Mr. Bowles' letter.(850)  Mr. Spotila testified that he consulted with Mark Stephens of his staff, who erroneously told Mr. Spotila that "all of the documents were entirely routine and nonsensitive."(851)

<P>In fact, at the top of the first page, Mr. Bowles' letter to Chairman LaFalce in bold type, contained the following notice:

<P>The information contained herein has been determined to be confidential in nature and therefore not releasable to unauthorized parties.  Disclosure of this information may violate Federal law (e.g., Privacy Act of 1974, the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1905). Utmost discretion should be exercised.(852)

Beyond this, Mr. Spotila's one sentence transmittal letter to Mr. Eggleston also specified that the information was confidential: "Enclosed is a copy of Erskine's letter yesterday to Chairman LaFalce (with confidential attachments)."(853)  

<P>While Mr. Eggleston was seeking this confidential SBA information, he was also speaking with other senior White House officials.  He left a message for Bruce Lindsey advising him of the confidential documents attached to the LaFalce letter:

<P>Neil Eggleston said the additional information is at SBA and is approximately a foot high.  He has a call in to SBA to find out if it contains reference to either the President or Hillary.  He can obtain a copy of the documents if it appears necessary but does not believe it is problematic.(854)

Mr. Eggleston did not recall talking with Mr. Lindsey on November 16 about the SBA documents.  Indeed, Mr. Eggleston implausibly claimed the message he left for Mr. Lindsey message led him to believe that he did not talk to Mr. Lindsey: "I don't remember actually doing it, and this document leads me to conclude that I probably didn't, and that I communicated with Mr. Lindsey through his secretary, which happened fairly frequently because Mr. Lindsey is extremely difficult to get in touch with."(855)  This testimony leaves open the obvious question of how Mr. Lindsey would have known what "additional documents" Mr. Eggleston was referring to in his message, if the two had not communicated previously about obtaining documents from the SBA.

<P>That afternoon, November 16, Associate White House Counsel Eggleston personally went over to the SBA offices and picked up the "approximately a foot high"(856) set of attachments from Mr. Spotila.  When he returned to the White House, he curiously left another message for Mr. Lindsey, at 4:58 p.m.  The message -- captioned "important" by Mr. Lindsey's secretary -- stated:  "Has some Whitewater documents to go over with you.  Will come by about 6:00 p.m."(857)

<P>Mr. Eggleston did not recall talking with Mr. Lindsey.  "As I've said repeatedly, I don't actually remember that happening.  This would certainly make it seem as if I had two communications with his secretary on that day with regard to these documents, and that makes a lot of sense.  I mean, that's the reason I was getting these."(858)  Mr. Eggleston claimed that he did not show documents to Mr. Lindsey:

<P>I did not, as I recall, I never got to him with these documents.  I don't remember whether he got back to me himself or through his secretary, but I recollect -- and again I don't know what Mr. Lindsey's recollection is -- but I recollect that I never showed him these documents.(859)

Mr. Lindsey did not believe that he saw the records.(860)  

<P>Back at the SBA, Mr. Spotila met with Mr. Bowles and told him that he had provided the confidential documents to the White House.(861)  Immediately, Mr. Bowles said, "I don't know if this is right or wrong, good or bad, up or down, but you better check with somebody with the Justice Department to see if it's okay."(862)  Mr. Spotila instructed Mark Stephens to contact the Justice Department.(863)

<P>The next day, November 17, 1993, Allen Carver, Principal Deputy Chief of the Justice Department's Fraud Section, called Mr. Stephens to obtain a copy of Mr. Bowles' November 15 response to Chairman LaFalce.(864)  Mr. Stephens advised Mr. Carver of the transfer of the confidential SBA documents.(865)  Mr. Carver and Mr. Stephens agreed to meet on November 18 at Mr. Carver's office with another attorney from the Fraud Section and an FBI agent working on the matter to discuss both Mr. Bowles report to Chairman LaFalce and the SBA's transfer of documents to the White House.(866)  

<P>At that time, the Justice Department instructed the SBA to retrieve from the White House the confidential documents and any White House materials analyzing those documents:  "Carver said get docs back + get their notations as well as all copies + list of people w/ access to docs."(867)  The notes also explained the reason for the Justice Department's objection: "Due to scope, they -- part of investigative body of material related to allegedly naming Pres.  WH should not get docs or apprised of investigation."(868)

<P>The next day, November 19, Mr. Carver talked with Mr. Stephens to ascertain the progress of the document retrieval.  According to Mr. Carver's contemporaneous memorandum about the call, Mr. Stephens said that "he called and spoke with Neal Eggleston earlier in the day, about 1:55 p.m., and Mr. Eggleston said that he would discuss the matter with the Deputy Attorney General and would discuss the matter further with Mr. Stephens early the next week."(869)

<P>Immediately, Mr. Carver called his supervisor, Fraud Section Chief Gerry McDowell, to advise him of Mr. Eggleston's conversation with Mr. Stephens.  According to contemporaneous notes of the conversation, Mr. McDowell said, "I've got to believe the WH counsel have done an incredibly stupid thing!"(870)  Mr. McDowell immediately notified the Associate Deputy Attorney General David Margolis.(871)  Mr. McDowell also talked directly with the Deputy Attorney General Phillip Heymann, who agreed with Mr. McDowell that this "could be an influence type situation."(872)

<P>According to contemporaneous notes, Mr. Eggleston called Mr. Heymann that day and talked to Mr. Nathan, Mr. Heymann's deputy.  Mr. Nathan apparently conveyed Mr. Heymann's strong sentiment to Mr. Eggleston, who, after the conversation, "wanted to get the documents back to the SBA as soon as possible."(873)  Curiously, White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum, Mr. Eggleston's supervisor, called Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell at 10:29 a.m. on November 19.(874)

<P>Although Mr. Eggleston was instructed specifically by the Justice Department to return the confidential documents immediately, he inexplicably waited for several days.(875)  Mr. Eggleston claimed that "[b]y that time, it was obvious that we would return the documents, but I had to talk to my supervisor before agreeing to do so."(876)  After speaking with the Justice  Department, Mr. Eggleston stated that he became "quite concerned, and spoke fairly quickly thereafter to Mr. Nussbaum and then worked hard to get the documents back as soon as I could."(877)

<P>On May 21, Mr. Eggleston finally reached Mr. Stephens, and arranged for the return of the documents.(878)  Mr. Stephens met Mr. Eggleston at the street corner in front of the SBA, where Stephens took back the box of SBA documents.(879)

<P>Mr. Eggleston reviewed the SBA documents.  He did not, however, "see any documents that I thought were particularly sensitive or that would have alerted me to the notion that Department of Justice might have had a problem."(880)  The career Justice Department prosecutors, however, had a different view of the matter.  Because the documents concerned a case involving allegations against the President, Mr. Carver believed that the White House had no right to any confidential documents or to be apprised of facts relating to the ongoing investigation.(881)

<P>The Justice Department immediately commenced an investigation into the transfer of confidential information to the White House.  On November 19, Mr. Carver discussed the investigation with the FBI.  The FBI Chief of the Governmental Fraud Unit, Richard Wade, "expressed concern over the possibility that the White House-SBA action, however, well-intended, could look like White House intervention."(882)  Mr. Carver recommended that the FBI interview Mr. Eggleston,(883) and also interview Mr. Kennedy concerning his conversations and contacts with Mr. Hale's attorney, Mr. Coleman, about the case.(884)

<P>This matter is still under investigation by the Office of the Independent Counsel.



V.<P>The White House Begins to Hold Whitewater Defense Meetings.<P>

<P>By late 1993, in the wake of new revelations, members of Congress and the national press began to call for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Whitewater and Madison Guaranty.  At that time, although the statute governing a judicial appointment of an Independent Counsel had lapsed, the Attorney General could appoint a special counsel to investigate the matter.

<P>During the first weeks of January 1994, senior officials of the White House met twice daily in Whitewater Response Team meetings.(885)  Present were Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes, who was hired in part to coordinate the Whitewater defense effort; Chief of Staff Thomas Mack McLarty; White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum; Deputy White House Counsel Joel Klein; Senior Advisor to the President George Stephanopoulos; Counselor to the President David Gergen; Associate White House Counsel Neil Eggleston; and Director of White House Communications Mark Gearan.(886)  Significantly, Mrs. Clinton and her Chief of Staff, Margaret Williams, attended some of the meetings.(887)

<P>During the Banking Committee hearings in the summer of 1994, senior White House officials provided evasive answers when asked to describe the purpose of the meetings.(888)  Mr. Lindsey and Mr. Nussbaum both failed to mention any specific subject discussed other than the handling of press inquiries related to Whitewater.(889)

<P>The Special Committee, however, obtained evidence this year that White House officials discussed far more than press inquiries at these twice daily meetings.(890)  Contemporaneous and detailed notes of these meetings, prepared by Mr. Gearan reflect an extensive debate over whether an independent or special prosecutor should be appointed, and, if so, the scope and duration of such an independent investigation.(891)  The notes also reflect the willingness of senior White House officials to attempt to interfere in ongoing investigations, particularly regarding former Arkansas Securities Commissioner Beverly Bassett Schaffer's regulation of Madison.(892)  Finally, the notes indicate yet another instance of government lawyers providing private legal services to the President and Mrs. Clinton.

<P>A.<P>Senior White House officials debated the appointment of a Special Counsel.



<P>Mr. Gearan's notes reflect considerable debate within the White House on the appointment of a special counsel versus independent counsel.  At a January 4, 1993 meeting, Mr. Gergen observed that the difference between independent counsels, appointed by a panel of federal judges, and special  prosecutors, appointed by the Attorney General, is that independent counsels "take on a life of their own."(893)

<P>The next day, January 5, 1993, the debate continued.   Mr. Nussbaum argued strenuously that no substantive difference existed between an independent counsel and a special prosecutor.(894)  In Mr. Nussbaum's view, both an independent counsel and a prosecutor are "subject to no control [and] come [with the] desire to get someone."(895)  Mr. Nussbaum expressed his "adamant" opposition to the appointment of any independent prosecutor.(896)

<P>Mr. Gearan recalled that Mr. Nussbaum, again continuing to exhibit his concern about control, compared an independent or special prosecutor to "somewhat of an unguided missile."(897)  To illustrate his point, Mr. Nussbaum envisioned two scenarios--the "good-hearted" prosecutor and the "bad-hearted prosecutor."(898)  The "good hearted" prosecutor would conduct an investigation and simply document his findings.(899)  In contrast, the "bad-hearted" prosecutor "goes in & decides a smell of corruption & can show some things of those people close around the principal."(900)  According to Mr. Gearan, the "principal" was President Clinton.(901)

<P>A significant, if not dominating, concern of the White House officials during the Whitewater defense meetings was Mrs. Clinton's opposition to the appointment of either an independent or a special prosecutor.  Mr. Gearan's notes of January 4, 1994 show that Mrs. Clinton joined the meeting -- already in progress -- and said "this looks like a meeting I might be interested in."(902)  Mrs. Clinton stayed for approximately 15 minutes,(903) and opposed the appointment of a special counsel.(904)  After she left several officials expressed the view that it was pointless to debate the merits of an independent counsel versus a special counsel given Mrs. Clinton's steadfast opposition to the appointment of either type of prosecutor.(905)

<P>On January 5, Mr. McLarty and Mr. Ickes both supported Mrs. Clinton's position.(906)  Mr. McLarty advised that the group move off the discussion of a special prosecutor or counsel because "HRC and BC don't want it."(907)  Harold Ickes stated that the discussion "was the biggest f------ waste of time."(908)  Before the Special Committee, Mr. Ickes testified that, although he could not recall the specific meeting, "it was well known that Mrs. Clinton had very, very grave reservations" about the appointment of any type of prosecutor.(909)

<P>On January 7, senior White House officials discussed attempting to persuade Mrs. Clinton to reverse her position on the appointment of a special counsel.(910)  Mr. Ickes advised that Secretary of State Warren Christopher or attorney Robert Barnett might attempt to convince Mrs. Clinton that a prosecutor should be appointed.(911)

<P>Ultimately, however, Mr. Ickes thought that it was "impossible" to "reopen" the discussion with Mrs. Clinton.(912)  Mr. Gearan recalled that everyone in attendance at the meeting agreed that it would be "impossible" for anyone, including the President, to change Mrs. Clinton's mind.(913)

<P>Later that day, Mr. Ickes again stated Mrs. Clinton's strong opposition to the appointment of any prosecutor.(914)  Mr. Gearan's notes of this second meeting indicate that Mr. Ickes regarded Mrs. Clinton's "adamant[] oppos[ition]" as one of the major problems with calling for a special counsel.(915)

<P>Senior White House officials and Mrs. Clinton feared that a special counsel might indict persons close to President Clinton.  According to Mr. Gearan's notes of a January 7, 1993 meeting, Mr. Nussbaum said, "Indictments will be Betsy Wright."(916)  Ms. Wright was Governor Clinton's former Chief of Staff in the 1980s and handled damage control for Whitewater and other Arkansas-related matters during the 1992 Clinton presidential campaign.(917)  Mr. Gearan implausibly denied that any concern was expressed that Ms. Wright would be indicted: "[A]t no time was I present in any conversation where Mr. Nussbaum suggested that there is any basis for Ms. Wright to be charged with anything like this."(918)  Mr. Gearan claimed that Mr. Nussbaum identified Ms. Wright as an extreme example of someone who might face prosecution by a special counsel investigating Madison Guaranty and Whitewater.(919)

<P>In any event, senior White House officials were concerned about possible indictments.  A White House document, entitled "Confidential:  Second Draft, Summary of Arguments Re: Whitewater," dated January 10, 1994, lists reasons against the appointment of a prosecutor.(920)  The memorandum specifically states that a special counsel investigation "may result in focus on friends and associates of the President, begin to squeeze them and may subject some to indictment."(921)  Mr. Ickes admitted that there "may well have been" concern among White House officials over possible indictments,(922) and "a lot of names came up" in the discussion of persons who might be "squeezed" or "hurt" by an investigation.(923)

<P>Evidently Mr. Nussbaum, too, believed that associates of the Clintons might be vulnerable to criminal prosecution.(924)  Mr. Gearan's notes of a January 5, 1993 meeting indicate that Mr. Nussbaum believed it would be possible for a criminal prosecutor to detect "a smell of corruption and can show some things of those people close around the principal."(925)  Mr. Gearan recalled this statement and admitted that "principal" referred to President Clinton.(926)

<P>During the debate over the appointment of a special counsel, senior White House officials apparently attempted both to influence Attorney General Reno's decision on the matter and to negotiate the scope of an impending investigation.  As early as the January 4 meeting, White House officials feared that Attorney General Reno would appoint an independent prosecutor without the White House's input on the matter.(927)  Mr. Gearan's notes of the January 7 meeting indicate discussion about Attorney General Reno's decision,(928) and preference for  "fewer [questions] to lessen the exposure."(929)

<P>Later, that day, Mr. Gearan noted that all meeting participants agreed, except for Bernard Nussbaum, that "Reno is boxed once Ind[ependent] C[ounsel] starts."(930)  Mr. Gearan confirmed that senior White House officials feared that after the Attorney General appointed an independent counsel, the matter would be "out of her hands" with regard to the duration and scope of the investigation.(931)  The notes suggest that a problem with calling for a special counsel is that "Reno has shut the door."(932)  Mr. Gearan denied that this entry referred to any rejection by Ms. Reno of attempts by the White House to influence her decision on the support of a special counsel.(933)

<P>On January 8, 1994, Mr. Ickes expressed displeasure with regard to how career Justice Department prosecutors--Donald Mackay and Alan Carver--were handling the ongoing federal investigations of Madison Guaranty and Whitewater.(934)  Mr. Ickes described Mr. Carver as a "bad guy" because he put the Clintons' private counsel, Mr. Kendall, on a speaker phone with two FBI agents and another prosecutor, Jim Nixon, on the other end.(935)  Mr. Ickes believed that the career Justice Department prosecutors "are f----- us blue."(936)

<P>Mr. Gearan claimed that Mr. Ickes' strong remarks were actually complimentary.  Mr. Gearan asserted that his reference to "Those guys are f------ us blue" meant that the Justice Department officials were "tough" on the White House and had acted "independent[ly]."(937)

<P>Mr. Ickes similarly claimed that "Those guys are f------- us blue" meant that "they were probably doing an effective job."(938)  Mr. Ickes denied that his remarks reflected White House irritation with Justice Department officials for spurning White House attempts to influence their investigation.(939)

<P>This testimony is contradicted, however, by handwritten notes of Roger Altman, Deputy Treasury Secretary and Interim CEO of the RTC.  In fact, Mr. Altman's support the inference that certain White House officials sought to negotiate the scope of any investigation of Madison Guaranty and Whitewater, but that Attorney General Reno rebuffed their efforts.(940)

<P>Mr. Altman's notes record two conversations that he had with Mrs. Clinton's Chief of Staff Margaret Williams during the same period in which the Whitewater Response Team meetings were taking place.  According to Mr. Altman's notes, dated January 6, 1994, at or about that time, "Maggie's strong inference was that the White House was trying to negotiate scope of an independent counsel with Reno and having enormous difficulty."(941)  Indeed, Ms. Williams told Mr. Altman that Mrs. Clinton herself did not want investigators "poking into 20 years of public life in Arkansas."(942)  According to notes of January 11, 1994, Ms. Williams told Mr. Altman:  "On Whitewater, HRC was paralyzed by it.  If we don't solve this matter within the next two days, we don't have to worry about her schedule on Health Care."(943)

<P>David Kendall, the Clintons' personal attorney, also participated in the White House discussions over the appointment of a special counsel, including whether the desirability of "attempting to impose limitations" on the investigation.(944)  In fact, Mr. Kendall drafted the very letter that Mr. Nussbaum ultimately sent to the Attorney General Reno requesting the appointment of a special counsel.(945)

<P>On January 12, 1994, after the President called for a special counsel, Attorney General Reno appointed Robert B. Fiske, Jr., to conduct the investigation into "whether any individuals or entities [had] committed a violation of any federal criminal or civil law relating to [the Clintons'] relationship with Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan Association, the Whitewater Development Corporation, or Capital Management Services, Inc."(946)

<P>B.<P>White House contacts with former Arkansas Securities Commissioner Beverly Bassett Schaffer. 



<P>Senior White House officials feared that Beverly Bassett Schaffer, the Arkansas Securities Commissioner who regulated Madison Guaranty in the mid-1980s, would contradict Mrs. Clinton's statements concerning the nature and extent of Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison Guaranty before the state regulator -- as Ms. Schaffer did in testimony before the Special Committee.  During the January 1994 Whitewater Response Team meetings, for example, senior White House officials recognized the importance of Ms. Schaffer's "story" and considered measures to ensure that she would continue to do a "good job" telling it.(947)

<P>During the 1992 presidential campaign, Ms. Schaffer's regulation of Madison became an issue.(948)  Ms. Schaffer allegedly ignored evidence of the S&L's insolvency and failed to close down Madison Guaranty.(949)  News reports also claimed that Ms. Schaffer approved a novel proposal submitted by Mrs. Clinton and her law firm on behalf of Madison Guaranty to raise needed capital by issuing preferred stock.(950)

<P>Questions also arose about whether Mrs. Clinton improperly benefitted from her representation of Madison.(951)  Mrs. Clinton wrote to Ms. Schaffer on behalf of Madison Guaranty on the novel preferred stock issue.(952)  Only two weeks later, in a letter to Mrs. Clinton addressed, "Dear Hillary," Ms. Schaffer approved the proposal.(953)  Mrs. Clinton forwarded Ms. Schaffers' letter of approval to James McDougal, the Clintons' Whitewater business partner and the owner and operator of Madison Guaranty.(954)

<P>These contacts between Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Schaffer, and Mrs. Clinton and Mr. McDougal, raised the issue of the propriety of the Governor's spouse attempting to influence a state regulator appointed by her husband on behalf of a client and business partner.

<P>Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Schaffer both denied allegations that Madison Guaranty had received any special treatment.  The Clinton campaign issued statements, attributed to Mrs. Clinton, expressly claiming that "she had done legal work for Madison Guaranty, but that it was not related to the Savings & Loan's dealings with state regulators."(955)  Ms. Schaffer, with the assistance of the Clinton campaign, composed statements, including two memoranda to the New York Times, denying any special treatment for Madison Guaranty.(956)

<P>In October 1993, the RTC sent a criminal referral to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Little Rock suggesting a connection between the preferred stock issue and campaign contributions to Governor Clinton.(957)  The referral noted that during the same month that Mrs. Clinton wrote to Ms. Schaffer, several questionable $3,000 Madison Guaranty cashier checks were written to the Bill Clinton Campaign.(958)  The referral stressed that Madison's preferred stock plan was approved quickly, and that Madison Guaranty's request to issue preferred stock occurred when Madison badly needed additional capital.(959)  The referral identified both Hillary Rodham Clinton and Beverly Bassett Schaffer as possible witnesses to criminal misconduct.(960)

<P>On September 29, 1993, the White House received a "heads up" about the substance of these referrals.(961) At the November 5, 1993 meeting at Williams & Connolly, senior White House officials and private attorneys for the Clintons discussed Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison Guaranty before the Arkansas Securities Department,(962) particularly the "coziness" of the relationship.(963)

<P>On December 20, 1993, the New York Times published an editorial, entitled "Open up on Madison Guaranty."(964)  The editorial described the close relationship between the McDougals and the Clintons and stated: "Others, however, are mildly troubled by the fact that Mr. Clinton did not order his regulators to crack down on Mr. McDougal even after he was advised by his own banking commissioner in 1983 that the savings & loan operator was engaged in imprudent banking practices.(965)  In the margin of the editorial, the President wrote: "This is important to be on top of.  Bassett did a good job in [campaign] on this--can she now?"(966)  The President then forwarded copies of the editorial containing his handwritten marginalia to Messrs. Lindsey and McLarty.(967)

<P>One week later, President Clinton and Mr. Lindsey attended a basketball game at the University of Arkansas with Ms. Schaffer and her husband.(968)  At the game, Mr. Lindsey asked Mr. Schaffer if she would be willing to answer press inquiries "with respect to her role and what she did and get that story out."(969)  Mr. Lindsey could not recall whether the President participated in the conversation.(970)

<P>On January 6, 1994, senior White House officials discussed Ms. Schaffer's role in connection with Madison's issuance of preferred stock.(971)  Associate White House Counsel Neil Eggleston recalled discussions about the importance to the President and Mrs. Clinton of Ms. Schaffer's statements "about her role" during the mid-1980s in regulating Madison Guaranty.(972)

<P>The next day, January 7, senior White House officials again discussed Ms. Schaffer.  This time, White House officials considered sending Mr. Lindsey, Washington lawyer Michael Waldman, and Paul Berry, a former roommate of President Clinton, "to [Arkansas] to meet [with] Beverly Bassett."(973)  Mr. Waldman recalled that the officials discussed "sending people down to talk to" Ms. Schaffer.(974)  Mr. Berry, a lobbyist for Union National Bank of Little Rock, had instructed Harry Don Denton, the Bank's loan officer, to make a $20,000 Whitewater loan to Bill Clinton in 1978 because he was "an up and coming political star;"(975)  Mr. Denton testified that he would not have made the loan absent Mr. Berry's urging.(976) 

<P>At a second January 7 meeting, senior White House officials expressed a sense of urgency about Ms. Schaffer's story beyond simple concern over a misperception in the press.(977)  According to Mr. Gearan's notes, Mr. Ickes exclaimed: "[Beverly] Bassett is so f---- important. [I]f we f--- this up, we're done."(978)  Mr. Ickes added, "[L]et's not talk it to death-let's just get it done."(979)  

<P>Mr. Ickes and Mr. Gearan both claimed that Ms. Schaffer's story "was so f------ important" because the White House did not want "to misstate anything."(980)  Neither could recall the meaning of Mr. Ickes' comment "let's get it done."(981)  Mr. Eggelston recalled, however, that "people recognize[d] that if [Ms. Schaffer] were suddenly to change what she had said publicly . . . and change her story about it, that would be a bad development."(982)  Mr. Eggleston confirmed that senior White House officials were concerned that Ms. Schaffer would "change" her "story."(983)

<P>After the discussion of Ms. Schaffer's importance, the senior White House officials again discussed sending an emissary to Ms. Schaffer.(984)  Although Mr. Ickes rejected the earlier idea to send Messrs. Berry, Waldman, and Lindsey because "it will come out,"(985) he still wanted someone to go over her statement "item by item" to "make sure her story is [okay]."55 (986)

<P>The senior White House officials feared that the press might discover that the White House had dispatched operatives to contact Ms. Schaffer and the appearance of impropriety.(987)  Mr. Ickes was concerned that such a contact could "create an appearance that there was an effort to influence her."(988)

<P>Both Mr. Ickes and Mr. Gearan denied that a decision was made to send someone to see Ms. Schaffer to "make sure her story is ok."56 (989)  In the end, the White House decided not to "send people who were connected with the White House to talk to Ms. Schaffer."(990)  Mr. Ickes claimed: "As far as I know, no one was sent from the White House to talk to Ms. Schaffer."(991)

<P>Within a week of the January 9, 1994 meeting, however, at least two attendees reached out to Ms. Schaffer.57   According to an Associated Press article, Ms. Schaffer resisted pressure from Messrs. Lindsey, Begala, and Rutherford to hold a press conference in 1994 concerning her contacts on Madison's preferred stock offering.(992) 

<P>In January 1994, Ms. Schaffer spoke to John Tisdale, the Clintons' attorney in Little Rock, and he suggested that she help prepare a chronology for the White House.(993)  In the second week of January 1994, Mr. Tisdale forwarded a series of memoranda to Mr. Lindsey.(994)  It is unclear whether Mr. Lindsey had requested that these memoranda be prepared.  A January 13, 1994 memorandum reflects communications between Mr. Tisdale's firm and Ms. Schaffer.(995)  It includes the background of Ms. Schaffer's dealings with Mrs. Clinton and "is based on our discussions with [Ms.] Schaffer."(996)

<P>Also in January 1994, Skip Rutherford, a public relations advisor to the White House on Whitewater-related matters, contacted Ms. Schaffer and her husband, Archie, to discuss the possibility that Ms. Schaffer might hold a press conference.(997)  Ms. Schaffer stated that while Mr. Rutherford did not specifically indicate he was calling on behalf of the White House, she was aware that Mr. Rutherford was "helping" Chief of Staff McLarty in some capacity.(998)  Deputy Chief of Staff Ickes denied knowledge of Mr. Tisdale's or Mr. Rutherford's contacts with Ms. Schaffer.(999)

<P>At the same time that White House officials were meeting twice daily to coordinate the Whitewater defense effort, Betsey Wright, the 1992 Deputy Campaign Director and longtime associate of the President, travelled to Little Rock from Washington, D.C.  Although Ms. Wright testified that she went to Little Rock to collect documents, she claimed that she was not asked by anyone at the White House to travel to Little Rock.  Rather, Ms. Wright testified that she took it upon herself to collect these documents.  

<P>Ms. Wright contacted Mr. Lindsey, Mr. Podesta, and Mr. Kendall and informed them of her intention to travel to Little Rock,(1000) and that the purpose of her trip was to collect campaign finance records.(1001)

<P>When asked why she went to Little Rock, Ms. Wright said, "I was trying to pull together - we kept getting the - the White House and I kept getting press questions about some campaign finance questions."(1002)  Ms. Wright testified that the documents would be a "handy reference" and could be used in Washington to ensure that she was speaking with a higher degree of factual understanding.(1003)  

<P>While in Arkansas searching through the documents, which were under the control of the Democratic National Committee, she "located a box that when I opened it up it was Whitewater documents, and I brought it back to DC and gave it to Mr. Kendall."(1004) Ms. Wright also retrieved and made copies of the appointment files for Ms. Schaffer and gave those files to Mr. Kendall.(1005)  In total, Ms. Wright testified that she had thirteen or fourteen boxes of documents shipped to her from Little Rock.(1006)

<P>On January 6, after locating the documents at the storage facility, Ms. Wright called Mr. Lindsey.(1007)  On January 6 or 7, Ms. Wright spoke with Mrs. Clinton.(1008)  The First Lady said to Ms. Wright, "there is going to be an independent or special counsel.  You need to get a lawyer. And that's how you should handle these documents." (1009)  

<P>C.<P>The Whitewater Response Team assigns defense tasks to White House officials.

<P>Records of the January Whitewater Response Team meetings reflected specific tasks assigned to the various members of the team.(1010)

<P>Many of these assignments focused on the possible appointment of a special counsel, including the legal, historical, and practical aspects of appointing a special counsel.  For example, a memorandum to the "Whitewater Group" from Mr. Ickes, dated January 10, 1994, assigned "2-3 page argument why no special counsel" to the White House Counsel's Office and Michael Waldman.(1011)  In addition, however, there were a number of assignments related to the factual and legal issues involving Whitewater.  Mr. Ickes claimed that this was all part of the White House effort to respond to press inquiries, but many of the tasks involved the Clintons' private legal defense issues.  For example, "synopsis of Whitewater/Madison Guaranty matter" was assigned to the White House Counsel's office, Bruce Lindsey and Mr. Waldman, and  "Memo re failure to take deduction on tax return for Whitewater losses" was assigned to Mr. Waldman.(1012)  Mr. Ickes also tasked Mr. Waldman to contact Chris Wade, the Whitewater real estate agent, to obtain Whitewater documents.58 

<P>Finally, Mr. Ickes assigned to the White House Counsel's Office a legal memorandum on the statute of limitation for civil actions to be brought against Mrs. Clinton or the Rose Law Firm in relation to the legal representation of Madison Guaranty.  Obviously, this legal memorandum did not relate to press inquiries nor did it relate to the White House Counsel's appropriate role in representing the United States Government.  Rather, it was legal analysis to assist President and Mrs. Clinton.  After Mr. Eggelston drafted the memorandum, Mr. Ickes forwarded it to Mrs. Clinton. 



VI:<P>The Retention and Investigation of Pillsbury Madison & Sutro.



<P>In November 1993, Congress enacted the RTC Completion Act of 1993,(1013) which extended the statute of limitations period for the RTC to initiate civil suits against failed savings and loans to February 1994.  The statute extended the limitations period only for claims arising from fraud, or from intentional misconduct resulting in unjust enrichment or in substantial losses to the institution.(1014)  

<P>On February 4, 1994, the RTC issued an Order of Investigation into potential civil claims against Madison Guaranty.  This investigation was intended to determine whether the RTC could bring civil claims against "former officers, directors or others who provided services to, or otherwise dealt with, Madison Guaranty."(1015)   

<P> In January 1994, the RTC's General Counsel, Ellen Kulka, decided that the RTC should retain outside counsel to investigate any potential civil claims against Madison Guaranty,(1016) and she selected the law firm of Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro (the "Pillsbury Firm") as outside counsel.(1017)  RTC Counsel told Ms. Kulka that Charles E. Patterson and Jay Stephens, former United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, were two of the three partners at the Pillsbury Firm whom they anticipated would handle the investigation.(1018)

<P> A.<P> The White House expresses concern over the retention of Jay Stephens. 

<P>By February 1994, senior White House learned that the RTC had hired the Pillsbury Firm and Mr. Stephens to investigate Madison Guaranty.  On February 25, 1994, George Stephanopoulos, Senior Advisor to the President, and Joshua Steiner, Chief of Staff to Treasury Lloyd Bentsen, discussed the RTC's decision to hire Mr. Stephens.(1019)  According to Mr. Steiner, Mr. Stephanopoulos was "angry" and raised his voice during the conversation.(1020)  Mr. Stephanopolous told Mr. Steiner that Mr. Stephens should be disqualified from handling the matter because Mr. Stephens had been a critic of the Clinton Administration.(1021)

<P>Jean Hanson, General Counsel to the Department of Treasury, testified that Mr. Steiner subsequently told her: "[D]o you believe those guys, they want to see if they can get rid of Jay Stephens."(1022)  Ms. Hanson understood that "those guys" referred to various senior White House officials.(1023)  Ms. Hanson further testified that on a separate occasion Mr. Steiner expressed the view that Ms. Kulka should be fired for hiring Mr. Stephens.(1024)

<P>In his diary, Mr. Steiner described his conversation with Mr. Stephanopolous:

<P>Simply outrageous that RTC had hired him [Stephens], but even more amazing when George then suggested to me that we needed to find a way to get rid of him.  Persuaded George that firing him would be incredibly stupid and improper.(1025)



Subsequently, Mr. Steiner disavowed his diary entry, claiming that he merged two conversations in one entry.(1026)  

<P>B.<P>Mr. Stephens is removed from the RTC investigation.

<P>Mr. Stephens was included in Pillsbury's initial proposal to the RTC as one of the three partners in charge of the matter.(1027)  During the early stages of the investigation in February 1994, Mr. Stephens attended meetings and was in daily contact with the RTC.(1028) 

<P>However, after numerous press reports describing Mr. Steiner's conversation with Mr. Stephanopolous appeared in the third week of March 1994, Mr. Stephens' role "diminished substantially and probably by the summer of '94, [he] was virtually disengaged from the matter."(1029)  Billing records of the Pillsbury Firm confirm that Mr. Stephens' work on the matter dropped off significantly.

<P>After March 1994, Mr. Stephens was told that it was no longer necessary for him to attend meetings with the RTC in Washington, D.C.(1030)  In addition, the documents relating to the investigation were moved from the Pillsbury Firm's Washington D.C. office, where Mr. Stephens resided, to its West Coast offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco.(1031)

<P> After March 1994, Mr. Patterson, the partner in charge of managing the Madison Guaranty investigation, did not assign any further work to Mr. Stephens.(1032)  Mr. Stephens did not draft the reports eventually submitted to the RTC and has no basis for either agreeing or disagreeing with any of the conclusions of the reports.(1033)  Mr. Stephens did not attend any presentations to the RTC about the findings in the reports.(1034)  Mr. Stephens conducted no depositions and no witness interviews, except for one interview relating to a request for documents.(1035) 

<P>Mr. Patterson spoke to Mark Gabrellian, Counsel to the RTC Legal Division, about Mr. Stephens' diminished role, but denied that anyone at the RTC asked him to remove Mr. Stephens from the case.(1036)  He did, however, advise Bruce Ericson, the billing partner on the Madison investigation, that Ms. Kulka had disliked something that Mr. Stephens had said during a meeting.  Mr. Patterson had the impression that "there was a personality conflict" between Mr. Stephens and Ms. Kulka.(1037)  Mr. Gabrellian similarly testified that Ms. Kulka and Mr. Stephens "were not getting along all that well."(1038)  Ms. Kulka admitted that she discussed Mr. Stephens with Mr. Patterson, but claimed that her only concern was with the quality of Mr. Stephens' work.(1039)

<P>  C.<P>The White House makes inaccurate claims about the Pillsbury report.

<P>Although Mr. Stephens was removed from the Madison Guaranty investigation, the RTC still wanted Mr. Stephens to review and approve the final version of the reports in December 1995.  Mr. Stephens, however, refused to do so: 

<P>Well in fact the RTC asked me to read the reports when the reports were filed in December, I declined to do that because I had not been involved in the engagement, I thought it was improper and inappropriate for me to review those reports simply so the RTC could have my imprimatur on those reports.(1040)

Mr. Ericson confirmed that Mr. Stephens had no involvement in the handling of the matter after the summer or at the latest fall 1994--over one year prior to the completion of the final reports.(1041)

<P>Moreover, on May 17, 1996, in a hearing before the Special Committee, Mr. Patterson and Mr. Ericson both admitted that Mr. Stephens did not "head the inquiry." (1042)  Both partners also agreed that statements indicating that the report was "written by Republican Jay Stephens" are entirely baseless and inaccurate.(1043)  The following exchange occurred at the Special Committee's hearings with lawyers from the Pillsbury firm:

<P>Senator D'Amato:  Let me read to you from the Chicago Sun Times. . . . Dated January 21st [1996] . . . Headline: Facts Fight Fiction Over Whitewater.



<P>Mr. Patterson:  Yes.



<P>Senator D'Amato:  What's the byline?



<P>Mr. Patterson:  Hillary Clinton.



<P>Senator D'Amato:  Let me take you down to the last sentence in the first page.  You want to start reading that?



<P>Mr. Patterson:  Would you like me to read it Senator?



<P>Senator D'Amato:  Yes, please.



<P>Mr. Patterson:  Since most Americans never heard about this report, let me fill you in.



<P>Senator D'Amato: This is referring to the report that your, this is the Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro report.  Go ahead.



<P>Mr. Patterson:  It was conducted by the RTC by one of the nation's leading law firms, Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro.  It took more than two years to complete and cost nearly $4 million.  A prominent republican, former U.S. Attorney, Jay Stephens, headed the inquiry.



<P>Senator D'Amato:  Mr. Stephens, did you head this inquiry?



<P>Mr. Stephens:  No, I did not.



<P>Senator D'Amato:  Mr. Patterson, did he head the inquiry?



<P>Mr. Patterson:  No, he did not Senator.



<P>Senator D'Amato:  Mr. Ericson, did he head the inquiry?



<P>Mr. Ericson:  No.(1044)<BR>

Indeed, after Mr. Stephens was identified in public statements as the author of the reports, he raised the following concern:

<P>On one or two occasions, I probably raised I believe most likely with Mr. Ericson, some concern that I had that the factual record wasn't clear or that I felt it was a little inappropriate that somehow or other either I was getting the credit or the blame for the reports, since I hadn't written the reports.(1045)



However, "the sense was the client [the RTC] did not want to get involved in making public statements about the firm's involvement."(1046)

<P>Contrary to White House claims, the final report of the Pillsbury firm did not exonerate the Clintons.  The Pillsbury investigation focused only on the narrow question whether it would be cost-effective for the RTC to bring any civil lawsuits against Madison to recover damages arising from the S&L's failure.(1047)  The authors of the Pillsbury report--Mr. Patterson and Mr. Ericson--testified that the reports do not exonerate anyone.(1048)  As Mr. Ericson put it, "I don't think our reports exonerated anybody of anything."(1049)

<P>After reviewing a draft of the supplemental Whitewater Report in November 1994,(1050) Mr. Stephens told Mr. Ericson that the report did not consider the "totality of the issues related to Madison because it was looking at Whitewater in isolation rather than looking at sort of the mosaic of real estate transactions that Madison was involved in and how Whitewater might tie in or relate to that."(1051)

<P>I believe I made some general comment that in my reading through the report that it either didn't highlight or didn't focus on the potential liability that might arise from a difference of equity participation by the partners in the Whitewater venture. . ..  And in doing that, the partners still maintain the same general equitable interest in the, or legal interest in the partnership, and as a consequence, one partner was benefitting substantially by the financial contributions of the other, and that there may be some issue that really raised a question about liability.(1052)



Mr. Stephens further told Mr. Ericson the Pillsbury Firm should interview more witnesses who "might have added perspective or input in trying to understand those transactions."(1053)  According to Mr. Stephens, the report was essentially "an accounting analysis."(1054)

<P>Pillsbury never examined many witness.  Some asserted their Fifth Amendment right not to testify: James and Susan McDougal, the Clintons' Whitewater business partners, Jim Guy Tucker, Chris and Rosalee Wade, Whitewater real estate agents.(1055)  The OIC asked Pillsbury not to interview John Latham, President and CEO of Madison Guaranty, or David Hale, President of Capital Management Services, Inc.(1056)

<P>Other witnesses who provided important testimony to the Special Committee, however, were simply not contacted by the Pillsbury firm.(1057)  Because of the limited scope of Pillsbury's representation, there were a number of areas that they did not explore, and therefore a number of witnesses that the Pillsbury Firm did not interview.  For example, the Pillsbury Firm did not interview many of the bankers involved in making or extending the Whitewater loans.59

<H2>  PART III.  WHITE HOUSE INTERFERENCE WITH CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRIES</H2>



I.<P>Mr. Ickes Provided Incomplete and Inaccurate Testimony to the Senate Banking Committee.



<P>Before the Senate Banking Committee in summer 1994, Mr. Ickes testified that he and other senior White House officials did not discuss the statute of limitations for Madison-related civil claims prior to February 2, 1994.  Documentary evidence obtained by the Special Committee indicates, however, that, in January 1994, Mr. Ickes and other White House officials were concerned about and discussioned when the statute of limitations would run on possible civil claims the RTC might bring against the Mrs. Clinton and the Rose Law Firm.(1058)

<P>In January 1994, considerable public interest existed in issues relating to Whitewater and Madison.  The RTC was investigating possible civil claims arising from the $60 million failure of Madison, and on January 20, 1994, a Special Counsel was appointed to investigate possible criminal conduct relating to Whitewater and Madison.  The statute of limitations for Madison-related civil claims involving fraud or intentional misconduct was scheduled to expire on February 28, 1994.  On February 12, 1994, Congress enacted Public Law 103-211, which extended the statute of limitations to December 31, 1995.

<P>Prior to the extension of the statute of limitations, the RTC had to decide by February 28, 1994, whether to bring suit, to seek tolling agreements, or to allow the statute to expire without action.  Because President and Mrs. Clinton faced potential liability relating to the failure of Madison, information regarding the status of the RTC investigation and its deliberations with respect to the statute of limitations was valuable to the Clintons in their defense effort.(1059)

<P>During its 1994 investigation, the Senate Banking Committee examined the state of knowledge of White House officials in January 1994 with respect to the statute of limitations for Madison-related civil claims.(1060)  Mr. Ickes testified about a meeting on February 2, 1994, between senior White House officials and Roger Altman, then Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and Acting Chief Executive Officer of the RTC, and Jean Hanson, General Counsel to the Department of the Treasury.(1061)  With respect to discussions about the statute of limitations at that meeting, Mr. Ickes testified: "I, for one, had little knowledge, if any knowledge, about the situation."(1062)

<P>Similarly, when asked by the Inspectors General of the Treasury Department and the RTC about this same February 2, 1994, meeting, Mr. Ickes testified: "Mr. Altman, as I recall, raised the issue of the upcoming--the possible--well, not the possible, but the fact that the statute of limitations, which I knew nothing about at the time, of the RTC in connection with an investigation that was apparently being conducted by the RTC on Madison Whitewater was about to expire."(1063)  Mr. Ickes emphasized that White House officials had no knowledge of the statute of limitations issue:  "There were questions about the statute of limitations, when it expired, under what conditions it expired.  I don't think anybody in the room other than Mr. Altman and Ms. Hanson had a clear picture of what the statute of limitations situation was."(1064)

<P>Evidence uncovered by the Special Committee shows, however, that in January 1994, Mr. Ickes assigned and received a memorandum on the statute of limitations for Madison-related civil claims.  Moreover, he discussed the issue with other senior White House officials prior to the February 2 meeting with Mr. Altman and Ms. Hanson.

<P>Among the evidence newly uncovered by the Special Committee is a memorandum to Mr. Ickes from W. Neil Eggleston, Associate Counsel to the President, entitled "Statute of Limitations in Actions Brought by the Conservators of a Financial Institution."(1065)  The memorandum, dated January 17, 1994, discussed the statute of limitations generally applicable to claims filed by the RTC on behalf of failed thrift institutions.<P>  More important, Mr. Eggleston's memorandum discussed the statute of limitations as applied specifically to Madison and identified March 2, 1994,60  as the final date for the RTC to file civil tort claims on behalf of Madison, the type of action usually brought against outsiders in financial institution cases.(1066)

<P>On February 20, 1996, the White House produced to the Special Committee memoranda from Mr. Ickes to the "Whitewater group," dated January 9 and January 10, 1994.  Both memoranda, which recorded assignments for various White House officials on matters related to Whitewater, listed the following item:

<P>"11.<P>Memo re statute of limitations for civil actions

<P><P>(counsel - assigned 1/8)"(1067)  

These documents thus indicate that Mr. Ickes assigned Mr. Eggleston to research and write a memorandum on the statute of limitations issue, which Mr. Eggleston completed and submitted to Mr. Ickes on January 17, 1994.

<P>Also on February 20, 1996, the White House produced to the Special Committee notes taken by Mr. Ickes of a Whitewater meeting at the home of Vernon Jordan.(1068)  This meeting took place on January 16, 1994, proximate to Mr. Eggleston's memorandum to Mr. Ickes and before the February 2, 1994, meeting with Mr. Altman and Ms. Hanson.

<P>Although Mr. Ickes testified that "I can only recall what I have on my notes,"(1069) the notes indicate that the statute of limitations was one of three topics of discussion at the meeting.  Those notes read in relevant part:

     "(2)     Statute of limitations<BR>

               - no allegation that Clintons have broken any<BR>

                    law & therefore<BR>

               - we don't know what civil refers to<BR>

                    - always exception for fraud"(1070) <BR>

The documentary evidence thus contradicts Mr. Ickes' prior testimony that he did not discuss the statute of limitations issue prior to February 2, 1994.

<P>In addition, Mr. Ickes testified to Senate Banking Committee in July and August 1994 that he did not know whether two memoranda detailing the potential liability of the President and Mrs. Clinton to the RTC had been sent to Mrs. Clinton.  The Special Committee has discovered, however, evidence indicating that, at about the same time of Mr. Ickes' testimony, his attorney, presumably based on information from Mr. Ickes, informed the White House Counsel's office that Mr. Ickes had indeed sent the memoranda to Mrs. Clinton and that Mrs. Clinton had asked him questions about the memoranda.(1071)

II.<P>The White House Interfered with Treasury IG and RTC IG Investigations into White House-Treasury Contacts.

<P>On March 3, 1994, in response to the public disclosure of possible improper contacts between Treasury and White House officials concerning the RTC criminal referrals, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen publicly announced that he would seek an opinion from the Office of Government Ethics ("OGE") about the propriety of those contacts.(1072)  When Secretary Bentsen contacted the OGE about conducting an investigation, the OGE informed him that the agency had no investigation capability, but could opine on the propriety of certain conduct if provided with the factual background.(1073)  The OGE suggested that an investigation into the relevant facts be conducted by the RTC's Office of Inspector General ("RTC-IG") and the Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General ("Treasury IG") (collectively "IGs").(1074)  Secretary Bentsen then requested that the IGs conduct an "independent" investigation of contacts.

<P>Thus, on July 1, 1994, the RTC-IG and the Treasury IG commenced a joint investigation of the White House-Treasury contacts.(1075)  The joint IG investigation included examining White House, Treasury Department and RTC officials to determine "what the purpose of these contacts between the Treasury officials was, whether or not the purpose of the contact was to further some public interest or some private interest."(1076)  

<P>A.<P>Independence of IG investigation is compromised

<P>On June 22, 1994, prior to the commencement of the joint IG investigation, James Cottos, the Assistant Treasury IG in charge of the investigation, expressed concerns to the Acting Treasury IG Robert Cesca about involvement in the investigation by Francine Kerner, the Treasury IG Counsel.(1077)  Specifically, Mr. Cottos indicated that there might be a conflict because Ms. Kerner, a member of the Treasury's Office General Counsel ("Treasury OGC"), reported to Deputy Treasury General Counsel Dennis Foreman and to Treasury General Counsel Jean Hanson -- the persons whose actions were at issue in the investigation.(1078)  Mr. Cottos believed that because Ms. Kerner's overall evaluation would be performed by the Treasury OGC's -- the very office being investigated -- she might have divided loyalties.(1079)  

<P>Others involved in the investigation shared Mr. Cottos' concerns about Ms. Kerner's independence.  Clark Blight, the chief investigator for the RTC-IG, testified that, "[e]arly on it seemed like she was an advocate for the White House."(1080)  Patricia Black, Counsel to the RTC-IG, testified that she "had concerns because she [Kerner] was located organizationally within the Office of General Counsel, and this was an investigation of the highest ranking members of that office.(1081)  And John Adair, the RTC Inspector General, was sufficiently concerned about Ms. Kerner's involvement in the investigation that on or around June 2, 1995, he called Acting Treasury IG Robert Cesca,  to suggest that Ms. Kerner be removed from the case.  Mr. Adair suggested that Ms. Black act as counsel for both offices.(1082)   Because, unlike Ms. Kerner, Ms. Black had no potential conflicts of interests since she was not in a reporting chain with anyone whose conduct was a subject of the investigation.

<P> Although Mr. Cesca refused to remove Ms. Kerner from the investigation, he recognized the need to insulate the investigation from the influence of the Treasury OGC.  On June 27, 1994, Mr. Cesca sent a memorandum to Ms. Hanson stating that Ms. Kerner and her staff would "report solely to the Inspector General on any matters relating to the investigation."(1083)  In addition, neither Ms. Kerner nor her staff were to "communicate any information about the substance of this inquiry without specific authorization from the Inspector General."(1084)<P>  Assistant Treasury IG James Cottos was not satisfied, however, that the terms of the June 27, 1994 memorandum would protect against actual or perceived conflicts of interest related to Ms. Kerner's participation in the investigation, because her overall evaluation "would still be done by the general counsel's office."(1085) 

<P>Mr. Cottos became even more concerned about Ms. Kerner's participation in the investigation when he learned that during the course of "three or four" witness interviews, attorneys for witnesses told the IG investigators that they had reached agreements with Ms. Kerner limiting the scope of interviews.(1086)

<P>Ms. Kerner's interaction with witnesses' attorneys raised questions.  For example, on July 11, 1994, at 10:44 p.m. the night before the deposition of Treasury Chief of Staff Joshua Steiner, a central figure in the investigation, Ms. Kerner sent an e-mail to Mr. Cottos with proposed questions for the interview.(1087)  Ms. Kerner was scheduled to meet with Mr. Steiner's attorney, Reid Weingarten, 15 minutes later, at 11:00 p.m. that same night.(1088)  Ms. Kerner did not specifically recall meeting with Mr. Weingarten on the night of July 11th, but she testified that she did have two meetings with him.(1089)  Ms. Kerner could not explain why she met with Mr. Weingarten at 11:00 p.m. the night before Mr. Steiner's deposition.

<P>Mr. Cottos knew that Ms. Kerner had met with Mr. Steiner's attorney but he was not aware that she had met with him after she had suggested deposition questions to him by e-mail.  When he was informed about the timing of the meeting, Mr. Cesca admitted that if she had met with Mr. Weingarten shortly after sending the e-mail, "there is a perception that there could be a compromise."(1090)

<P>Meanwhile, on June 30, 1994, the Assistant Treasury IG James Cottos, Chief Investigator for RTC-IG Clark Blight and their respective investigative staffs learned that Treasury OGC officials wanted to obtain copies of witness interview transcripts to assist in preparing Treasury witnesses prepare for upcoming congressional hearings.  According to Mr. Blight, there was "a general agreement on the investigative side that the transcripts would be kept with the investigators, would not be released.  And that it is my recollection that Cottos was supportive of that."(1091) 

<P>Despite this agreement the Treasury OGC began to receive deposition transcripts form Ms. Kerner in early July.  According to Assistant General Counsel Kenneth Schmalzbach, Ms. Kerner provided deposition transcripts to him sometime between July 8, 1994 and July 13, 1994.(1092)  

<P>This exchange took place even though Mr. Schmalzbach and Ms. Kerner both knew that the June 27, 1994 memorandum had erected a "wall" with respect to Ms. Kerner's communication to the Treasury OGC.(1093) According to Mr. Cottos, Ms. Kerner was not supposed to communicate with members of the Treasury OGC about the transcripts.(1094).<P>

<P>Because the transcripts contained information about the "substance" of the investigation, this transfer of information from Ms. Kerner to Treasury OGC directly violated the terms of the June 27 memorandum.  According to RTC-IG John Adair, the transcripts contained 90% of the substance of the investigation(1095), including sensitive information about the ongoing investigation.(1096)  

<P>Ms. Kerner made this prohibited exchange of confidential RTC information without asking any of the other investigators, including Acting Treasury Inspector General Cesca, who only learned that the transcripts were forwarded to the Treasury OGC on July 18, 1994, when Ms. Kerner transferred the transcripts to Mr. Schmalzbach.(1097)  Mr. Cottos similarly was not informed about the transfer until July 18.(1098)  Neither Mr. Cottos nor Mr. Cesca recalled any conversation with Ms. Kerner about transferring transcripts to the Treasury OGC prior to July 18,(1099) and Mr. Cottos testified that he had objected to providing any transcripts to the Treasury OGC.(1100)  This transfer violated the terms of the June 27th memorandum.

<P>Members of the RTC-IG's office working on this "joint" and "independent" investigation were not consulted about Ms. Kerner's surrender of the confidential deposition transcripts to Ms. Hanson's staff.(1101)  The RTC-IG was not told about the transfer of the transcripts to the Treasury OGC until they were delivered.(1102)  In fact, RTC-IG John Adair had a conversation with Ms. Kerner on July 19, 1994 and she failed to mention the previous day's release of the transcripts to the Treasury OGC.(1103)  Mr. Blight, Chief Investigator for the RTC-IG, was surprised that the Treasury OGC had received copies of the transcripts, because he thought that the investigative staffs had agreed during the June 30, 1994 meeting that "nothing would be released until we had a final report."(1104)  According to Ms. Black, transferring transcripts to the office that was under investigation violated standard investigatory procedures(1105): "One the investigation was not complete and as everybody has said, was still open, and the second concern that I had was that the transcripts had privileged information in them . . . information concerning the underlying RTC criminal investigation."(1106)

<P>Mr. Schmalzbach and other members of the Treasury OGC prepared Treasury Secretary Bentsen and other Treasury witnesses, including Mr. Altman and Ms. Hanson, for Congressional testimony.(1107)  Mr. Schmalzbach first gained access to Ms. Hanson's deposition transcript "sometime after July 8 but before July 13."(1108)  The Senate Banking Committee deposed Ms. Hanson on July 14, 16 and 17, 1994.  

<P>Mr. Schmalzbach admitted that he attempted to obtain information from the IGs' investigation and fact finding, and to provide that information to the Treasury witnesses so they could prepare for Congressional testimony.(1109)  He further admitted that he knew Mr. Foreman and Ms. Hanson were to be "walled off," but believed he could use the transcripts to prepare Mr. Foreman and Ms. Hanson without advising them of the source of his information.(1110)  Mr. Altman's testimony as to whether he was told that President Clinton was upset about the manner of his recusal changed between the time of his deposition and his hearing testimony.(1111)

<P>The supposedly "independent report" submitted by the IGs to the OGE was edited by Treasury OGC.  On July 22, 1995, Acting Treasury Inspector General Cesca sent an initial draft of the joint IG report -- the report that would provide the factual basis for the OGE opinion -- to Treasury Secretary Bentsen.(1112) 

<P>During the drafting process, Mr. Cottos identified signs of bias on the part of Ms. Kerner toward the investigation of Ms. Hanson and others in the Treasury OGC. (1113)  Ms. Kerner edited the draft IGs report.(1114)   Mr. Cottos felt that Ms. Kerner's proposed edits "were slanting the facts or attempting to slant the facts that we had gathered in the initial draft."(1115)  Mr. Cottos explained to Ms. Kerner "that we were not the Jean Hanson defense team."(1116)  After the OGC obtained a draft of the IGs report, Stephen McHale, Deputy Assistant General Counsel, and two other OGC members sent suggested changes to Ms. Kerner,(1117) and she then sent them to the IGs.(1118)

<P>The suggested edits of the Treasury OGC were offered at a drafting session held by the IGs on July 28, 1995.(1119)  Ms. Kerner claimed that at the meeting she identified these as "some suggested edits from Mr. Schmalzbach's office."(1120)  According to Mr. Cottos, Ms. Kerner did not state that the suggestions were made by the OGC, but rather that the suggested changes were her own.(1121) 

<P>Counsel to the RTC-IG Black was disturbed when she learned what had happened because, "again information had gone outside the investigation."  Ms. Black stated that the IGs do not normally give a report to a general counsel's office for commentary.(1122)

<P>Treasury Secretary Bentsen was not aware that members of the Treasury OGC took advance copies of the transcripts or the draft report, or made substantive changes to the draft report that the IGs sent to the OGE.(1123) 

<P>At the July 28 meeting, the IGs also agreed that, although the transcripts would be appended to the final report submitted to the OGE, all confidential information concerning the RTC criminal referrals would be redacted.(1124)  During the meeting, Ms. Kerner left twice to call Mr. Schmalzbach to inform him that the RTC-IG was insisting that the transcripts be redacted before any public release.<P>  

<P>Ms. Kerner also called Mr. Schmalzbach to warn him that Ms. Kulka, General Counsel to the RTC, was threatening to testify that the investigation had come under the sway of the Treasury Secretary's office.  In an e-mail to Edward Knight, Secretary Bentsen's Executive Secretary, at 10:44 a.m. on July 28, Mr. Schmalzbach reported: 

<P>I just heard from IG Counsel Francine Kerner, who is meeting with RTC IG people to determine final changes in the IG's chronology.  At 11:30, that group will meet with Ellen Kulka, who is expected to argue that the transcripts of the IG's interviews should not be released at all with the IG's report. . . Accordingly you need to place the call to Jack Ryan, the deputy CEO at RTC, and not to Jack Adair. . . You also need to be aware of a piece of background.  Counsel to RTC's IG, Pat Black, is telling the morning's gathering of the IG people working on the report that if Kulka fails to win on the issue of not making the transcripts public, she is prepared to testify at the hearings that the IGs group has been under the sway of the Secretary in performing their investigation.(1125)

<P>Ms. Kerner admitted that Ms. Black advised her of Ms. Kulka's threat to reveal that the joint IG investigation was under the Treasury Secretary's sway, but she claimed that she did not recall contacting Mr. Schmalzbach to warn him.(1126)  

<P>B.  Confidential information is provided to the White House.

<P>Meanwhile, President Clinton named Lloyd Cutler as Special Counsel to the President to replace Bernard Nussbaum, who had resigned from the position of White House Counsel.  The President and White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty instructed Mr. Cutler to conduct an internal investigation of the propriety of the conduct of White House personnel in connection with the White House-Treasury contacts.(1127)

<P>On June 21, 1994, Secretary Bentsen met with Mr. Cutler and agreed to share information gathered during the joint IG investigation with the White House.(1128)  Mr. Cutler indicated to Treasury Secretary Bentsen that the White House would like to obtain all of the IGs' interview transcripts, not just the transcripts of witnesses that the White House did not interview.(1129)  Mr. Cutler would coordinate the exchange of transcripts through Mr. Knight or by other members of Mr. Cutler's staff with Treasury Secretary Bentsen's staff.(1130)  Although Secretary Bentsen admitted that he had ordered the investigation to be under the control of the IGs, he had two or three meetings with Mr. Cutler about providing transcripts, and he "assured" Mr. Cutler that the Treasury would provide the transcripts to the White House in an expedited manner.(1131)  

<P>Mr. Knight testified that he was not aware that Mr. Cutler made a request to Secretary Bentsen to receive copies of the transcripts.(1132)  Mr. Knight specifically stated that "as far as requests [for transcripts] coming to me or the Secretary, I am aware of none."(1133)  Mr. Knight also denied that he had any discussions with anyone in the White House Counsel's Office about the transcripts in July of 1994.(1134)  He went as far to say that, "I think I have a fairly good recollection of when I talked to the counsel to the President of the United States.  I have no recollection of talking to him during the month of July.  Absolutely none."(1135)  

<P>Mr. Knight's testimony, however, was contradicted both by the documentary evidence and the testimony of Mr. Cutler.61   When asked about a July 5, 1994 meeting between the White House Counsel's Office, OGE, RTC-IG and Treasury IG -- a meeting at which White House Special Associate Counsel Jane Sherburne asked to receive copies of the transcripts and was rebuffed -- Mr. Cutler stated: "I remember calling Mr. Knight on a number of occasions in this time period on the issue of when we were going to receive the transcripts."(1136)  Mr. Cutler's calendar indicated that on July 6, 1994 he met with Mr. Knight and Treasury Assistant General Counsel Robert McNamara.  Mr. Cutler recalled that the meeting involved a discussion of the White House's "need to get transcripts and the fact that we had an understanding to that effect."(1137)  Mr. Cutler stated that the meeting resulted from a previous conversation he had with Mr. Knight about the RTC's objection to providing transcripts to the White House.(1138)

<P>Mr. Cutler stated that his plan in conducting the White House investigation rested on the Treasury's stated willingness to provide its deposition transcripts.  Indeed, by early July, officials in the White House Counsel's Office decided not to interview certain witnesses because they would obtain transcripts of those witnesses' depositions from Treasury.(1139)  

<P>When asked about any restrictions that may have been put on the use of the transcripts at the beginning of the investigation, Mr. Cutler once again referred to substantive conversations he had with Mr. Knight: "My recollection is I had discussions with Mr. Knight about the timing of when we would receive the transcripts in which he indicated to me that there were some objections from within the Treasury at lower levels as to delivering us the transcripts on a seriatim basis.(1140)  Mr. Cutler testified that at the time he began the White House internal investigation in early July, he understood that there was an agreement that the White House would be getting all the transcripts of the all the IGs depositions.(1141)  

<P>Secretary Bentsen did not recall whether he consulted either the RTC-IG Adair or the Acting Treasury IG Cesca about his decision to release the transcripts.(1142)  Mr. Cesca testified that he was not aware that Secretary Bentsen had agreed to provide the White House with the confidential transcripts.(1143) 

<P>During the July 5, 1994, Ms. Black told Ms. Sherburne that the White House could not have the transcripts.62 (1144)  Ms. Black explained that "we were adamantly opposed to the transcripts going outside of the investigatory circle."(1145)  Ms. Black testified that handing over the transcripts to either the Treasury OGC or the White House would have "violated our processes, it was not a normal investigative technique and of course, it can affect other witnesses' testimonies if they know what other witnesses have said."(1146)  

<P>Mr. Cottos expressed similar concerns stating, "I objected from the beginning about transcripts being given to anyone."(1147)  He worried about "other witnesses being able to read someone's testimony and possibly tailoring their own" testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.(1148) 

<P>Ms. Black informed RTC Inspector General Jack Adair that the White House made a request for transcripts, and that Ms. Sherburne's request had been rebuffed.  Mr. Adair believed that the issue had been settled.(1149)  Neither Mr. Adair nor Ms. Black were consulted prior to the surrender of the transcripts to the White House.(1150) 

<P>On July 18, 1994, Ms. Kerner sent Mr. Cottos an e-mail informing him that Ms. Sherburne had requested again to see IGs' transcripts to determine "whether there are inconsistencies with White House interviews."(1151)  On July 19, Mr. Cottos stated his opposition to Ms. Sherburne's request, and noted that, if anything, the IGs should be given copies of the White House's interviews.(1152)  Thus, as of at least July 19, 1995, Ms. Kerner was on notice that Mr. Cottos opposed providing the White House with deposition transcripts.

<P>Nevertheless, on July 23, 1994, Treasury OGC delivered copies of IG transcripts to members of the White House Counsel's Office.(1153)  On July 23, 1994, Mr. McHale of Treasury OGC sent a transmittal letter to Ms. Sherburne that documented that the Treasury OGC provided the White House copies of transcripts of depositions taken by the IGs' investigators. pursuant to certain restrictions placed on the use of the transcripts.(1154)  These transcripts contained confidential information related to the RTC criminal investigation of Madison Guaranty.(1155)  

<P>Secretary Bentsen testified that he "made the final judgement" to send the transcripts to the White House.(1156)  

<P>Acting Treasury IG Cesca, testified that on July 23, 1994, he learned that Mr. Cutler had requested the transcripts, and that this request came to him via the Treasury Secretary's office.(1157)  Mr. Cesca decided that it was not appropriate to release the transcripts to the White House.  As he put it, "[m]y concern centered around the fact that that was the essence of what we were investigating"(1158) and would raise the "same issue that we were investigating in terms of contacts between the Treasury and the White House."(1159)  

<P>Shortly thereafter, Mr. Cesca had a conference call with Ms. Kerner and Mr. McHale, who told him that Mr. Knight had called to inform him of "the [Treasury] Secretary's desire to release the transcripts to Lloyd Cutler."(1160)  Following this conversation, Mr. Cesca agreed to release the transcripts with certain restrictions.(1161)

<P>Whether or not the Acting Treasury IG's approval was needed is unclear in light of the testimony given by Mr. Cutler and Treasury Secretary Bentsen that they had already reached an agreement that the White House would receive the transcripts.  According to Mr. Knight, he did not know about the agreement to provide the transcripts until November 7, 1995,(1162) the day before his testimony before the Special Committee.  Mr. Knight claimed that he was approached by the Acting Treasury IG to ask Secretary Bentsen's opinion as to whether the transcripts should be released,(1163) and that the Secretary then told him that he thought it would be reasonable to cooperate with Mr. Cutler.(1164)   

<P>Although Mr. Cottos was the Treasury IG investigator responsible for investigation, and despite his previous objections to releasing the transcripts, he was not told about the transfer until two days after it occurred.(1165)  Mr. Cottos was "not very happy about" the transfer, and asked why he had not been consulted.(1166)  Mr. Cottos was still of the opinion that the transcripts should not have been released to anyone outside the investigation, "whether it be the White House, the Secretary, anyone else."(1167) 

<P>The RTC-IG officials testified that they were "shocked" when they learned that the transcripts had been turned over to the White House.(1168)  Ms. Black was "astounded" and "angry" when she was told of the transfer.(1169)   According to Ms. Black:

<P>We had vehemently objected to that, and it was done over our expressed objections without any consultation.  And this was -- again, to go back to the fundamentals, this was an investigation that we were doing into Treasury's leak of information to the White House, and they had done it again.(1170)

Similarly, Mr. Blight was "shocked that it happened . . . It is not something you do . . . The investigation was still open.  I mean the investigation was about the Treasury giving information to the White House, and here it goes again, the same thing."(1171)  Mr. Adair emphasized that it was not appropriate for the White House to seek access to unredacted transcripts because the "unredacted transcripts contained information about the criminal referrals, which basically was the reason we were conducting the investigation in the first place, to see whether any of that information had been provided by Treasury to the White House."(1172)

<P>The transmittal letter accompanying the transcripts contained the stipulation that the transcripts "are being provided solely to assist you in the preparation for Mr. Cutler's testimony before the House and Senate Banking Committees."(1173)  But, according to a May 8, 1995 Associated Press story, Mr. Cutler used the confidential transcripts to brief witnesses at the White House prior to their testimony before the House and Senate Banking Committees.(1174)  The article revealed that Mr Cutler stated that he would "confront" witnesses about discrepancies in their testimony, but denied that he would tell witnesses where he got his information; Mr. Cutler was quoted as saying, "I think it was perfectly appropriate to say that 'this is your testimony to us.  There is conflicting testimony.  Are you sure that's what you said?"'(1175).  

<P>Before the Special Committee, Mr. Cutler initially tried to distance himself from the comments attributed to him in the Associated Press story.  He stated that despite the suggestion in the May 8 article that the White House used the information they learned from the transcripts to prepare witnesses before they appeared before the Senate Banking Committee, they "did not do so."(1176)  But Mr. Cutler ultimately admitted that, "[w]e had the information from the transcripts in our heads and all we did was to say there may be some conflicting testimony, are you sure of what you've told us?"(1177)  In addition, the transcripts were used in preparing a report that was shown during a July 24, 1994 meeting at the White House for the private lawyers for the White House witnesses.  The report contained a White House "version" of the events.(1178)

<P>The Treasury OGC also transmitted summaries of deposition transcripts63  to the White House.(1179)  Inexplicably, these summaries were sent without a transmittal letter.(1180)  Mr. McHale, who supervised the preparation of the summaries,(1181) did not know how the summaries were sent to the White House.(1182)  Four other Treasury witnesses -- Mr. Knight, Mr. Schmalzbach, Mr. McHale and Mr. Dougherty -- also did not know.(1183)  Mr. Dougherty, an OGC attorney, denied that he delivered the summaries to the White House, stating, "I have no recollection of ever providing any summaries to anyone."(1184)

<P>In a July 27, 1994 memo to Ms. Sherburne, Sharon Conaway, an attorney in the White House Counsel's Office, described a conversation she had with Mr. Dougherty.  Ms. Conaway wrote that Mr. Dougherty "gave me summaries of the transcripts he did not realize we did not have and told me that the transcripts could be given to witnesses and their counsel."(1185)  Mr. Dougherty did not recall saying that to Ms. Conaway.(1186)  Ms. Sherburne testified that:

<P>On July 27th, 1994, I asked Sharon Conaway, a lawyer on our team, to ask Treasury whether it had lifted its condition on our use of the IG transcripts so that we could send the transcripts of Mr. Katsanos's IG testimony to counsel for Ms. Caputo (Mrs. Clinton's press secretary).  I recall that Ms. Conaway informed me that she spoke with David Dougherty, a lawyer in the general counsel's office at Treasury.  He advised her that Treasury had not lifted the restrictions on the transcripts themselves, but she told me that Treasury had a form of summary that it evidently believed did not raise the same concerns that caused it to restrict the use of the underlying transcripts.  And that there accordingly were no restrictions on the dissemination of these summaries.  Ms. Conaway told me that Dougherty offered to give these summaries to our review team, and that he did so.  She also told me based on Mr. Dougherty's advice, she sent the summary of Katsanos's IG deposition to Ms. Caputo's lawyer.(1187)

<P>Ms. Sherburne claimed that the White House received the summaries with the understanding that they were unrestricted.(1188)  Secretary Bentsen testified, however, that the summaries should have been subject to the same restrictions that applied to the transcripts.(1189)  That is, they could "be used only by his [Mr. Cutler's] staff and only for his testimony before the committee."(1190)  

<P>At least one deposition summary was sent directly to William Taylor, an attorney for a White House witness, Lisa Caputo, the Press Secretary to the First Lady.(1191)  The transfer of transcripts to the lawyers for one of the White House officials directly violated the restrictions contained in the July 23 transmittal letter, which prohibited the White House from disclosing the transcripts "to individuals (other than Mr. Cutler) who may be called as witnesses by either Committee.  Similarly, you have agreed not to disclose these transcripts to counsel for any such individuals."(1192)  

<P>During the 1994 Congressional hearings, held on the propriety of White House-Treasury contacts, Mr. Cutler also relied on the OGE opinion as evidence that no White House personnel had engaged in improper conduct.(1193)  Mr. Cutler represented to the Senate Banking Committee on August 4, 1994 that he had found no evidence of wrongdoing, and he said that the OGE had "informally concurred" with his conclusion that "no violation of any ethical standard . . . occurred."(1194)

<P>According to Stephen Potts, the Director of OGE, the OGE "did not do an analysis of the conduct of White House officials as to whether or not they violated the code of conduct."(1195)  In a November 8, 1995 letter, Mr. Potts confirmed that the "OGE did not `informally concur' in Mr. Cutler's conclusion that no violation of ethical standards occurred by any White House official."(1196)  Another OGE official, Jane Ley also testified that, "we didn't make any conclusions about the conduct of individuals in the White House."(1197)

<P>When confronted with Mr. Potts' statements that the OGE had not "informally concurred" with Mr. Cutler's findings that no White House officials had violated any ethical standards, Mr. Cutler admitted:

<P>Now, I may have gone too far when I testified before this Committee on August the 5th . . . . When I said that the Office of Government Ethics has informally concurred that they don't think any White House official has violated these ethical standards.(1198)64 

<P>When he was directly questioned about the inconsistencies between his August statements, and the assertions made by the OGE in November 8, 1995, letter, Mr. Cutler again admitted he may have "transgressed.65 "



III.<P>White House Interfered with the Special Committee's 1995-96 Investigation

<P>On January 5, 1994, in the midst of White House discussions over the appointment of a special counsel, James Hamilton advised President Clinton:



<P>The White House should say as little and produce as few documents as possible to the Press.  Statements and documents likely will be incomplete or inconclusive, and could just fuel the fires.(1199)  



Clearly, senior White House officials followed Mr. Hamilton's advice in producing documents to the Special Committee. 

<P>On June 2, 1995, the Special Committee sent its first request for documents to the White House.  Documents continued to trickle in from the White House until as late as May 11, 1996.  Some agencies, notably the RTC and the Justice Department, should be applauded for their efforts to produce documents.  The RTC produced more documents than any agency and did so in a timely manner.  Unfortunately, the White House and various persons associated with the White House were not nearly as forthcoming in producing their documents.  The Special Committee was forced to engage in protracted efforts to obtain documents.  Even worse, documents often were produced months after they were first requested or subpoenaed.

<P>A.<P>The refusal of William Kennedy to comply with the Special Committee's subpoena for his notes of the November 5, 1993 White House defense meeting.

<P>In response to a subpoena from the Special Committee on October 26, 1995, commanding the production of all documents in the White House's custody or control related to Whitewater, Madison Guaranty, CMS and related matters, the White House advised the Special Committee on November 2, 1995, that it would not produce a number of responsive documents on the grounds of privilege.  The withheld documents included notes taken by former Associate Counsel to the President William Kennedy at an important November 5, 1993 meeting of White House officials and the Clintons' private attorneys concerning Whitewater and Madison Guaranty.

<P>On December 5, 1995, Mr. Kennedy, citing the attorney-client privilege, refused to answer the Special Committee's questions about the substance of meetings.(1200)

<P>On December 8, 1995, the Special Committee issued a subpoena duces tecum to Mr. Kennedy directing him to "[p]roduce any and all documents, including but not limited to, notes, transcripts, memoranda, or recordings, reflecting, referring or relating to a November 5, 1993 meeting attended by William Kennedy at the offices of Williams & Connolly."  Mr. Kennedy refused to comply with the Special Committee's subpoena.  On December 14, 1995, after careful consideration, the Chairman overruled the objections to the subpoena, and the Special Committee voted to order Mr. Kennedy to produce the responsive documents by 9:00 a.m. on December 15, 1995.  After Mr. Kennedy failed to comply with this order and after unsuccessful efforts to reach agreement with the White House, the Special Committee voted on December 15, 1995, to report the matter to the Senate.(1201)

<P>On December 20, 1995, the full Senate adopted Senate Resolution 199, directing the Senate Legal Counsel to initiate a civil action in federal District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1365 (1994), for an order requiring the witness to produce the subpoenaed documents.  If the district court determines that the witness has no valid reason to withhold the subpoenaed documents, the court would direct the witness to produce them.  If a witness disobeys that order, the witness could be found in contempt of court.  The district court, in its discretion, could order sanctions against the witness to induce compliance with its order to produce the documents.

<P>  On December 22, 1995, before the Senate Legal Counsel commenced a civil contempt proceeding, the White House reversed course, and Mr. Kennedy produced his notes to the Committee.  The notes were highly relevant to the Committee's investigation.  They provided evidence that confidential information, which the White House had inappropriately gathered from various agencies investigating Whitewater and Madison, was passed to the private lawyers representing President and Mrs. Clinton to assist their personal legal defense.  Although the White House claimed that certain confidential RTC information contained in the notes had also been reproduced in the press, the White House had information from Treasury officials with which to judge whether those press accounts were, in fact, accurate.  Beyond this, the notes contained details that identified additional investigative avenues for the Committee.

<P>B.<P>White House delays in producing highly relevant documents to the Special Committee. 

<P>On January 29, 1996 the White House produced the notes of White House Director of Communications Mark Gearan from meetings of the Whitewater defense team in January 1994.(1202)  These notes were relevant to inquiries by the Banking Committee during its hearings in 1994 as well as the inquiries of the Inspectors General from the Department of Treasury and the RTC.  When asked to explain the sudden appearance of these notes, Mr. Gearan stated that the notes "were inadvertently moved to the Peace Corps with other personal effects in boxes."(1203)  The White House Counsel's Office had told Mr. Gearan that they would take responsibility for document production from his White House files.(1204)  

<P>In October 1993, Mr. Gearan learned that the notes were removed from the White House and instructed an assistant to return these notes to the White House.(1205)  For reasons unknown, the notes were not returned:  

<P>The next point in time where this came to my attention was at the end of January, January 31st, I believe, where there was - in conversations with my counsel, who had been talking to the White House counsel, they had indicated to my counsel that they were having difficulty finding my files at the White House, which of course we found surprising, at which point I went back to the area where they were stored and found that the had not been returned as I had thought.  So, I called counsel and we immediately returned them to the White House counsel.(1206)

<P> 

Mr. Gearan came across the notes while going through his personal effects looking for pictures and other materials to put on his walls at the Peace Corps.(1207)  The White House eventually produced the notes to the Special Committee on January 29, 1996 and February 7, 1996.

<P>As a result of reviewing Mr. Gearan's notes, the Special Committee questioned several witnesses.  At least two of the witnesses, Mr. Lindsey and Mrs. Schaffer, had appeared before the Special Committee just weeks prior to the production of Mr. Gearan's notes.

<P>On February 13, 1996, the White House produced important documents from the files of Mr. Waldman, Special Assistant to the President.  Mr. Waldman claimed that he discovered these documents in his office  in a file marked "WWDC"--Whitewater Development Corporation--in the course of an office move.(1208) It is unclear why, if Mr. Waldman or the White House had conducted a proper search for documents, documents from a file marked "WWDC" were overlooked.

<P>Then, on February 20, 1996, the White House produced documents prepared by Mr. Ickes in January 1994.  In an explanatory letter for this production, the White House wrote that "two of the documents among this material had been provided by Mr. Ickes to the Counsel's Office in March of 1994.  Unfortunately, in the course of our review, we mistakenly overlooked them . . . As to the remainder of the material produced today, all from the early 1994 period, Mr. Ickes was under the mistaken belief that this material had been provided to the Counsel's Office and his private counsel in March of 1994."(1209)  

<P>Finally, on March 1, 1996, the day after funding for the Special Committee expired under S. Res. 120, Bruce Lindsey, Deputy Counsel to the President, produced notes concerning the November 5, 1993 Whitewater defense team meeting and other responsive documents.  The transmittal for Mr. Lindsey's notes stated cryptically that the documents "inadvertantly were not produced to you or the White House Counsel's office."(1210)

    <H2>THE ROSE LAW FIRM BILLING RECORDS</H2>

     Late in the afternoon on Friday, January 5, 1996, a messenger delivered a large, yellow manila envelope to the Special Committee.  Inside were 114 pages of documents, most measuring 11 by 17 inches, accompanied by a letter from David Kendall, lawyer for the Clintons.  Mr. Kendall wrote: "I enclose documents which we have stamped DKSN028928 to DKSN029043.  These documents were discovered yesterday by Ms. Carolyn Huber, Special Assistant to the President/Special Director of Correspondence."(1211)  The matter-of-fact tone of Mr. Kendall's prose belied the significance of this production.  The 114 enclosed pages, computer printouts of the Rose Law Firm's billings to Madison Guaranty, constitute the best, and therefore most important, evidence concerning Mrs. Clinton's representation of James McDougal's S&L in the mid-1980s--a relationship that was under investigation by at least three separate federal agencies.

<P>The records had been subject to several different federal subpoenas, besides that of the Special Committee, for nearly two years.  When federal investigators served their subpoenas, the billing records were nowhere to be found.  Despite extensive searches conducted by the Rose Law Firm, neither the originals nor copies were discovered.(1212)  The billing records were not in the firm's computers, its client files, or its storage facility.(1213)  The disappearance was not isolated, but rather occurred in the context of a larger pattern of removal, concealment and, at times, destruction of records concerning Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison.

I.<P>The Destruction and Mishandling of Rose Law Firm Files.

<P>In 1988, Mrs. Clinton ordered the Rose Law Firm to destroy records relating to her representation of Madison.(1214)  This was not a routine destruction of records.  At the time, federal regulators were investigating the operations and solvency of Madison, in anticipation of taking over the institution.  These Rose Law Firm records, which, after Madison's failure would belong to the RTC,(1215) would have been directly relevant to that investigation.

<P>By ordering their destruction, Mrs. Clinton eliminated pertinent records and also exposed her firm to potential liability with respect to her representation.  If such representation was proper, as Mrs. Clinton has claimed, her document destruction deprived the law firm of the records necessary to defend itself in a suit by federal investigators.  Moreover, in 1988, Seth Ward, a former associate of Mr. McDougal and Webster Hubbell's father-in-law, was suing Mr. McDougal over the Castle Grande land deal that federal regulators have described as a fraud.(1216)  Mrs. Clinton had performed work on the project, including numerous telephones calls and meetings with Mr. Ward, and the law firm's records of her work and the transactions surrounding this land deal certainly would have been highly relevant to the conduct of that suit.

<P>The pattern recurred only a few years later.  According to the Rose Law Firm, Mr. Hubbell obtained some billing records reflecting Rose's representation of Madison in 1989 or 1990.  The Rose Law Firm represented to the Special Committee that a firm partner, then representing the RTC in litigation concerning Madison Guaranty, provided all billing records for Madison to Mr. Hubbell to ascertain whether the firm had a potential conflict of interest.(1217)  According to the Rose Law Firm: "The Rose partner was assured by Mr. Hubbell a few days later that the prior representation had been disclosed to the RTC.  Rose does not know what Mr. Hubbell did with the records."(1218)

<P>The mishandling of Madison documents continued during the 1992 presidential campaign.  After questions arose about the Clintons' investment with the McDougals in Whitewater and Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison Guaranty before a state agency, Mrs. Clinton's then-law partner, Vincent Foster, collected all the information he could on the Madison representation from the Rose Law Firm's files.  At the conclusion of the campaign, the firm's files on Madison, which were by now the property of the RTC as conservator of Madison, as well as certain files of other Rose clients for whom Mrs. Clinton had performed legal services, were secretly removed from the firm by another then-Rose Law Firm partner, Webster Hubbell.  Mr. Hubbell removed these files, some of which were the firm's only copies,(1219) without obtaining the consent of the firm or client.(1220) 

II.<P>The "Disappearance" and "Discovery" of the Rose Law Firm Billing Records. 

<P>During the 1992 presidential campaign, on February 12, 1992, an unknown person printed out a set of the Rose Law Firm's computerized records of billings to Madison Guaranty.(1221)  These computerized records were the only source of detailed information about the services that the Rose Law Firm provided and billed to Madison Guaranty.  The records provide information well beyond that reflected in bills sent to Madison--such as the date services were performed, the amount of time expended by particular lawyers, and precise services performed, including the identity of persons with whom Rose lawyers spoke or met in the course of representing Madison.(1222)  

<P>Mr. Hubbell asserted that either he or former Deputy White House Counsel Vincent Foster, also a Rose partner, directed the Rose accounting department to print the billing records for Madison.(1223)  In addition to obtaining the computerized billing records, Mr. Hubbell also retrieved other files and documents relating to Mrs. Clinton's work for Madison:

<P>I recall in 1992 that the issue regarding our representation of Madison and specifically our work before the Arkansas Securities Department was of interest to Mr. Gerth of The New York Times, and that our firm was being questioned by people within the campaign about her work in that regard.  We did some work in trying to organize and pull up the files.  And in connection with that, bills were pulled and reviewed by myself and Mr. Foster and Mr. Massey, I believe.(1224) 

Because of allegations that Mrs. Clinton had a conflict of interest in appearing before her husband's appointee, Beverly Bassett Schaffer, Arkansas Securities Commissioner, Mr. Hubbell reviewed the records in 1992.  During his review, Mr. Hubbell made notations next to entries in the bills related to the firm's work in connection with Madison's novel proposed preferred stock offering before the Arkansas Securities Department.  According to Mr. Hubbell, "the issue then, way back when, was did Mrs. Clinton ever have any contact with the Arkansas Securities Department.  When we went back to the bills, that was the only, I believe, indication on the bills of a direct contact with the Arkansas Securities Department, so I underlined that -- probably gave that to Vince."(1225)

<P>Indeed, in notes taken during the 1992 campaign concerning Whitewater, Susan Thomases recorded a February 24, 1993 conversation with Mr. Hubbell about the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison.  According to her notes, Mr. Hubbell told Ms. Thomases that Mrs. Clinton did all the billing for the Rose Law Firm to Madison, and that she had numerous conferences with Mr. McDougal, Madison President John Latham, and Rick Massey, then a junior associate at the firm.(1226)  Ms. Thomases' also indicated that Mrs. Clinton had reviewed some documents and that she had at least one telephone conversation with Ms. Schaffer in April 1985.(1227)  Ms. Thomases recorded in the margin of her notes next to this entry: "Acc. to time Rec."  She testified that "[t]his is my notation for according to time records,"(1228) and that the notation reflected what Mr. Hubbell had indicated to her.(1229)

<P>Ms. Thomases asserted, however, that she herself did not see the billing records,(1230) nor did she ever ask to see the time records.(1231)  Ms. Thomases further claimed that, other than her conversations with Mr. Hubbell in 1992, she never had any discussions with anyone about the billing records.(1232)  She contended that she had no knowledge concerning the handling of billing records and how records were transported from Little Rock to the White House Residence.(1233)

<P>In addition to Ms. Thomases, Mr. Hubbell discussed the contents of the records in 1992 with Loretta Lynch, an attorney working on Whitewater issues for the Clinton campaign.(1234)  Ms. Lynch testified that, in response to press inquiries, she talked to Ms. Schaffer and reviewed the files of the Arkansas Securities Department in an attempt to reconstruct Mrs. Clinton's role in representing Madison before state regulators.(1235)  During the course of this investigation, she and Ms. Thomases agreed that they should ask members of the Rose Law Firm about billing records.(1236)  Ms. Lynch talked to Mr. Hubbell about Mrs. Clinton's work for and billings to Madison Guaranty,(1237) who advised her that he had reviewed the Rose Law Firm's billing records concerning Madison Guaranty.(1238)  Ms. Lynch also knew that Mr. Foster had reviewed the billing records,(1239) but she does not recall speaking with anyone else at the Rose Law Firm regarding the billing records.(1240)  Ms. Lynch testified that she did not handle any records reflecting billings by the Rose Law Firm to Madison Guaranty, and that she had no knowledge regarding how those records came to be deposited in the White House Residence.(1241)

<P>When Mr. Hubbell and Mr. Foster reviewed the billing records in 1993, they spoke with each other about the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison.  Mr. Hubbell identified the notes written by Mr. Foster in red ink on the billing records found in the White House Residence--e.g., "HRC--this suggests 1st matter"(1242) or "HRC I believe there was a subsequent bill"(1243).  These notes suggested to Mr. Hubbell that "[w]e were both working on it, and this is what he did to ultimately give it to somebody to indicate what was going on, what the records showed highlighted."(1244)  As of the time Mr. Hubbell handled the records, Mr. Foster had not written or made any notations on the records.(1245)  

<P>According to Mr. Hubbell, Mr. Foster was the last person he saw handling the billing records.(1246)  Mr. Hubbell did not know who removed the records from the Rose Law Firm,(1247) or how they came to be left in the White House Residence.(1248)  He claimed not to have spoken with anyone about the billing records since the 1992 presidential campaign.(1249)

<P>Mr. Hubbell stated that he may have spoken with Carolyn Huber, Special Assistant to the President and Special Director of Correspondence for the White House, about the records when she was the administrator of the Rose Law Firm, but not when she was at the White House.(1250)  When Mr. Hubbell learned that Ms. Huber had discovered the billing records in her office, "I kind of smiled."(1251)  According to Mr. Hubbell, "I know Ms. Huber, and it just didn't surprise me that all of a sudden she discovered them."(1252)  He explained, somewhat cryptically:  "First of all, I felt sorry for her, but just that all of a sudden, oh, you're looking for the billing records, here they are.  You know, it just wouldn't surprise me that something like that happened.  I read about it, but I just smiled about it."(1253)

<P>During the first two weeks of August 1995, while the Special Committee was holding hearings into the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death, Ms. Huber testified that she saw the Rose Law Firm billing records for the first time.(1254)

<P>The billing records, which were subject to several different federal subpoenas, were in the Book Room, a small room on the third floor of the First Family's private quarters in the White House Residence.(1255)  The room is adjacent to Mrs. Clinton's private office and is accessible only to a limited number of private guests and staff.(1256)  Gifts, book, and memorabilia are stored in the Book Room until they can be catalogued and put away.(1257)  In the center of the room sits a large table where such memorabilia are piled.(1258)

<P>In early August 1995, Ms. Huber was gathering newspaper and magazine clippings in the Book Room when she noticed the records in clear view on the edge of the table.(1259)  The records were folded in half, and Ms. Huber recognized the records, from her experience at the Rose Law Firm, to be billing records.(1260)  Ms. Huber recalled that, specifically, the records were not on the table a week or two earlier when Ms. Huber was last in the Book Room.(1261)  Because Ms. Huber thought that the billing records were left in the Book Room for her to file,(1262) she placed the records in a box to be taken to her office without studying them.(1263)  White House ushers carried this box, along with several others, and placed them on the floor of Ms. Huber's office.(1264)  Later, a table was placed over these boxes.(1265)

<P>For several months, Ms. Huber forgot about the records.  Meanwhile, the Special Committee, continuing its investigation into activities and transactions relating to Whitewater and Madison, held several hearings in December 1995 on the extent of Mrs. Clinton's role in the Madison representation.  The billing records figured prominently in these hearings.  On December 1, 1995, Mr. Hubbell was unable to provide complete answers about the Mrs. Clinton's role in the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison because he did not have the billing records to refresh his memory.(1266)  Likewise, Ms. Thomases testified on December 18, 1995, about her work during the campaign and her notes about billing records relating to Mrs. Clinton's work for Madison.

<P>On the morning of January 4, 1996, Ms. Huber was having new furniture placed in her office in the East Wing of the White House.(1267)  In the process, the table that had concealed the box containing the billing records for five months was removed.(1268)  Once the boxes were uncovered, Ms. Huber began to file the contents of the boxes.(1269)  As she was filing, Ms. Huber pulled the billing records out of their box and examined them more closely.(1270) 

<P>Immediately, Ms. Huber realized the billing records were related to Madison Guaranty.(1271)  She was horrified because she understood their significance; she had seen several subpoenas calling for the production of Madison Guaranty records, including these very records.(1272)  She had also assisted the President and Mrs. Clintons' personal counsel, David Kendall in searching and reviewing documents in the White House responsive to those subpoenas.(1273)  Ms. Huber contacted Mr. Kendall and asked him to meet her in her office as soon as possible because she had found some documents.(1274)  After calling Mr. Kendall, Ms. Huber called her attorney, Henry Shuelke.(1275)

<P>Early in the afternoon on January 4, Ms. Huber met with Mr. Kendall.(1276)  She gave him the records and explained her discovery.(1277) Worried, Ms. Huber asked Mr. Kendall whether she had done the right thing in contacting him.(1278)  Mr. Kendall assured Ms. Huber that she had made the correct decision.(1279)  Mr. Kendall examined the billing records and asked Ms. Huber whether she could identify the handwriting in red ink.(1280)  Ms. Huber identified some of the notations as Mr. Foster's handwriting.(1281)  Mr. Kendall then told Ms. Huber to maintain custody of the records,(1282) and that he would contact White House counsel and meet with her later in the day.(1283)

<P>Mr. Kendall then contacted Special Counsel to the President Jane Sherburne and Mr. Shuelke, who agreed to meet around 5:00 p.m. in Ms. Huber's office.(1284)  Ms. Sherburne informed her supervisor, Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes, and her staff of the discovery of the billing records.(1285)  No one contacted the Independent Counsel or any other investigative agency, including the Special Committee.  Mr. Kendall and Ms. Sherburne claimed that they did not inform Mrs. Clinton on January 4 about the discovery of the billing records.(1286)

<P>Ms. Huber, Mr. Kendall, Ms. Sherburne and Mr. Shuelke met that evening.(1287)  Ms. Huber once again explained her discovery of the records.(1288)  Ms. Huber told the assembled attorneys -- as she also had testified to before the Special Committee -- that she clearly recalled seeing the records in early August 1995.  Ms. Huber and the lawyers together examined the billing records page by page.(1289)  Ms. Huber identified for them some of the handwriting on the billing records as Mr. Foster's and some as the Rose Law Firm bookkeeper.(1290)  In view of Mr. Foster's notes in red ink, the billing records were obviously a copy of the original records.(1291)  Other handwritten notes appear to have been made on the original and then copied.(1292)

<P> At one point in the meeting, Ms. Sherburne asked to speak with Mr. Kendall and Mr. Shuelke in the hallway.(1293)  Ms. Sherburne raised the issue of how the documents should be reproduced and whether the integrity of the documents should be preserved in case the records would later be examined for fingerprints.(1294)  The attorneys never considered contacting the Independent Counsel for advice on how best to proceed.(1295)

<P>Mr. Kendall and Mr. Shuelke returned to Ms. Huber's office and photographed the box in which Ms. Huber found the records earlier in the day.(1296)  Ms. Sherburne and Ms. Huber searched for a color copier in the White House offices.(1297)  After finding a copier, Ms. Huber made copies, while Ms. Sherburne collated and checked for completeness.(1298)    Two color copies of the billing records were made.(1299)  Mr. Kendall took the original set of the billing records and one copy with him that evening.  Ms. Sherburne took the other copy of the billing records to examine and to keep for White House records.(1300)

<P>The next morning, January 5, 1996, Mr. Kendall and Ms. Sherburne notified the Independent Counsel of the discovery of the billing records.(1301)  That same morning, Ms. Sherburne informed President Clinton of their discovery.(1302)  Later that afternoon, Mr. Kendall produced a copy of the billing records to the Special Committee.(1303)  Copies of the billing records were also produced to the other investigative agencies.(1304)

III.<P>Mrs. Clinton's Statements in Light of the Rose Law Firm Billing Records. 

<P>The billing records provide the best evidence of the legal services performed by Mrs. Clinton for Madison Guaranty and, as a result of the failed memories of many Rose Law Firm attorneys, are the only source of detailed information about the legal services rendered to Madison.  Whereas the bills and statements sent to clients indicate only the total amount due and the general services performed, these computerized billing records provide detailed information on the specific task performed, the date that it was performed, the person who performed the task, and the amount of time expended on the task.(1305)  The computerized billing records are thus an invaluable asset in reconstructing Mrs. Clinton's actual involvement in the matter.  This is especially so with respect to Mrs. Clinton's billings to Madison, because her timesheets were apparently destroyed in 1988.(1306) 

<P>In total, Mrs. Clinton billed Madison Guaranty for 89 tasks, including 33 conferences with Madison Guaranty officials, on 53 separate days.(1307)   

<P>A.   Madison's retention of the Rose Law Firm

<P>During the 1992 campaign, the Clinton campaign sought the facts surrounding the Rose Law Firm's retainer with Madison Guaranty in 1985 and 1986.  In a March 18, 1992 memorandum to senior campaign officials Bruce Lindsey and David Wilhelm, Loretta Lynch noted that the campaign had conducted an exhaustive review of available documents, but certain questions regarding the retainer remain that "simply must be answered by Hillary and Bill themselves."  Among these questions were:

<P>1.  Did Bill Clinton solicit a retainer agreement for the Rose Law Firm from Jim McDougal?  If so, when did that happen and what were its terms?  Who, other than Jim and Susan were privy to that discussion? 



<P><P><P><P><P>* * *



<P>7.  When was the Rose Law Firm put on retainer by McD and for what business (LL has asked Webb Hubbell this question numerous times.  The answer continues to change, despite the repeated press inquiries on this exact point).(1308)

<P>This memorandum was prepared after the Clinton campaign had already released a fact sheet stating that Richard Massey, a young associate in the Rose Law Firm in 1985, was responsible for the retainer--not Mrs. Clinton:

<P>The Rose Law Firm was retained to represent Madison Guaranty.  The business was brought to the firm not by Hillary Clinton but by Richard Massey, long time friend of John Latham, Madison's CEO.(1309)

 

<P> The circumstances surrounding the Rose Law Firm's retainer with Madison were not resolved during the 1992 campaign.  Mrs. Clinton, and others on her behalf, have repeatedly made statements that Mr. Massey brought in Madison Guaranty as a client and that, even though she was the billing partner on the matter, she was merely a "backstop" because the firm did not permit associates to bill clients directly.(1310)

<P>During a press conference on April 22, 1994, Mrs. Clinton stated that Mr. Latham, the President of Madison Guaranty, asked Mr. Massey whether he would be interested in representing Madison in connection with a proposed stock offering.  Mrs. Clinton claimed that she became involved in the matter only because Mr. Massey "needed a partner to serve as his backstop, and that was one of the rules of our firm."(1311)  Mrs. Clinton further explained that Mr. Massey was aware that she knew Mr. McDougal, so "he came to me and asked if I would talk with Jim to see whether or not Jim would let the lawyer and the officer go forward on this project.  I did that, and I arranged that the firm would be paid $2,000 retainer."(1312)  

<P>In an unsworn statement to the RTC in November 1994, Mrs. Clinton similarly told investigators that "she recalled Massey came to her and asked her to be the billing attorney which was a normal practice when an associate was handling the matter. . . .Mrs. Clinton recalled that a Madison official (individual unknown) approached Rick Massey regarding a preferred stock offering in an effort to raise capital."

<P> In a sworn response to an RTC interrogatory in May 1995, Mrs. Clinton elaborated on her story.  Mrs. Clinton stated that Mr. Massey approached her because "certain lawyers" in the Rose Law Firm were "opposed" to representing Mr. McDougal until Mr. McDougal paid an outstanding bill, and he was aware that Mrs. Clinton knew Mr. McDougal.  Mrs. Clinton wrote:

<P>In the spring of 1985, Massey came to see me because he had learned that certain lawyers at the firm were opposed to doing any more work for Jim McDougal or any of his companies until he paid his bill and then only if Madison Guaranty agreed to prepay a certain sum. . . I believe Massey approached me about presenting this proposal to Jim McDougal because  he was aware that I knew him.

<P>Mr. Massey, however, directly contradicted Mrs. Clinton's account in sworn testimony before the Special Committee.  According to Mr. Massey, he was not responsible for bringing in Madison as a client.(1313)  Mr. Massey testified specifically that Mr. Latham never offered him Madison's business,(1314) and that he did not recall approaching Mrs. Clinton with a proposal to represent Madison.(1315)  Mr. Massey also indicated that he did not ask Mrs. Clinton, as she claimed, to be the billing attorney.(1316)

<P>David Knight, a former Rose partner specializing in securities law, testified that he attended the lunch meeting during which, according to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Latham allegedly retained Mr. Massey and the Rose Law Firm.(1317)  Mr. Knight confirmed Mr. Massey's testimony that Mr. Latham did not ask Mr. Massey to represent Madison on the preferred stock offering.  Quite to the contrary, according to Mr. Knight, the subject of that stock offering never arose.(1318)  In fact, Mr. Latham informed Messrs. Knight and Massey at the lunch that Mr. McDougal made all hiring decisions and that Madison already had outside counsel.(1319)

<P>Mr. Latham testified that Mr. McDougal, not he, made the decision to retain the Rose Law Firm.(1320)  In an interview with RTC investigators, Mr. Latham similarly stated that "McDougal had friends over there and he suggested we use them.  When asked who the friends were Latham said that they were Hillary Rodham Clinton and others."(1321) 

<P>Mr. McDougal has also contradicted Mrs. Clinton's account about the retainer.  Mr. McDougal has stated that he put Mrs. Clinton on retainer as a favor to then-Governor Clinton.  In 1992, Mr. McDougal told Jim Blair and Loretta Lynch that Governor Clinton, wearing jogging pants, visited his office and told him that he and Mrs. Clinton were pressed for money and asked Mr. McDougal to give some work to Mrs. Clinton.(1322)  Two hours later, Mrs. Clinton visited Mr. McDougal to set up the retainer.(1323)  According to notes taken by Mr. Blair, Mr. McDougal said that he remembered the encounter "explicitly" because Governor Clinton, in his exercise clothes, left a permanent stain on Mr. McDougal's "new leather contour chair."(1324)

<P>In 1993, Mr. McDougal repeated this account of the so-called "jogging" incident to the Los Angeles Times.  Governor Clinton reportedly dropped by Mr. McDougal's trailer office, told Mr. McDougal that the Clintons were financially strapped, and asked Mr. McDougal to throw some work to Mrs. Clinton.(1325)  Mr. McDougal also repeated to the newspaper what he had told Mr. Blair: "I hired Hillary because Bill came in whimpering they needed help." Mr. McDougal said he had no specific legal work in mind when he hired Mrs. Clinton.(1326)  That same day, Mrs. Clinton visited Mr. McDougal's office, and Mr. McDougal put her on retainer for $2000 a month.

<P>On May 8, 1996, during the Tucker-McDougal trial in Little Rock, Mr. McDougal revised his story somewhat.  He testified that President Clinton came by one morning and, "I said to Bill something to the effect of, `We're needing more legal work.  Would it help Hillary if we gave some of the work to the Rose Firm?' And he said yes."(1327)  Mr. McDougal did not recall telling Mr. Blair that Bill Clinton specifically said he "needed" money.(1328)  Although Mr. McDougal denied stating in an FBI interview that "Clinton came in claiming he had financial problems,"(1329) he did recall that Mrs. Clinton "came by the same day" to set up the retainer.(1330)  

<P>At the Tucker-McDougal trial, President Clinton testified that he recalled visiting Mr. McDougal, but did not recall asking Mr. McDougal to place Mrs. Clinton on retainer.(1331)

<P>Mrs. Clinton's account of her role in connection with the Madison retainer turns on the alleged existence of a debt that Mr. McDougal's Madison Bank & Trust owed to the Rose Law Firm in 1985.  According to Mrs. Clinton, she insisted on the $2000 per month retainer to assure her partners that Mr. McDougal would pay the firm's fees--an issue that, she claims, arose because of Mr. McDougal's failure to pay fees owed to the Rose Law Firm in connection with its representation of Madison Bank & Trust.

<P>Documentary evidence and testimony provided to the Special Committee, however, indicate that the outstanding balance of Rose's bill to Madison Bank & Trust was paid in late October 1984, many months prior to Mrs. Clinton's retainer in April 1985.

<P>Gary Bunch, President of Madison Bank & Trust since 1970, provided the Special Committee with documents showing that the legal fees owed to the Rose Law Firm were paid in late October 1984.  The Minutes of Madison Bank & Trust for October of 1984 indicate that $5,000 in legal fees were owed to the Rose Law Firm for work on the "Huntsville move appeal,"(1332) a matter concerning the relocation of the bank, and that "Mr. McDougal seconded that Mr. Bunch will negotiate settlement with the firm."(1333)  Mr. Bunch confirmed that Mr. McDougal directed him to pay the outstanding Rose Law Firm bill for the Madison Bank & Trust matter in full in October 1984.(1334) 

<P>A receipt from Madison Bank & Trust's debit ledger show $5,000 in legal fees were paid on October 23, 1984.(1335)  In addition, the bank's minutes for November 27, 1984 confirm this payment: "The reduction in earnings was attributed to heavy accounting fees for the audit and a payment of legal fees from 1983 lawsuit."(1336) 

<P>Among the billing records discovered in the Book Room of the White House Residence was a 1981 bill from the Rose Law Firm to Madison Bank & Trust.  This bill, for over $13,000, was marked "Paid."  A note in Mr. Foster's hand, however, stated: "HRC I believe there was a subsequent bill."(1337)

<P>Following the discovery of the billing records and the testimony of Mr. Massey before the Special Committee, Mrs. Clinton changed her story in a February 1996 interview with RTC investigators.  According to Mrs. Clinton, the late Vincent Foster, not Mr. Massey, first informed her that Mr. Massey wanted to do work for Madison: "I believe it was Vince Foster who came to me, who said that Mr. Massey wanted to do this work, but the partners didn't want him to do it."(1338)  When asked who suggested that she approach Mr. McDougal, Mrs. Clinton answered:  "I don't have a specific recollection.  I believe it was Vince Foster, but I'm not positive."(1339)

<P>B.<P>Mrs. Clinton's contacts with regulator Beverly Bassett Schaffer.



<P>In 1985, the Rose Law Firm represented Madison in connection with a proposal for a preferred stock offering before the Arkansas Securities Department.  During the 1992 campaign, allegations surfaced that Beverly Bassett Schaffer, who Governor Clinton appointed as Arkansas Securities Commissioner, gave preferential treatment to Madison Guaranty because of her relationship with the Governor and Mrs. Clinton.  The Clinton campaign denied that Mrs. Clinton attempted to influence Commissioner Bassett.  

<P>The billing records show that Mrs. Clinton called Ms. Schaffer the day before the Rose Law Firm submitted Madison's proposal for its preferred stock offering to the Arkansas Securities Department.(1340)  The records reflect that Mrs. Clinton billed as much as one hour to the call.(1341)  Ms. Schaffer notified Mrs. Clinton of the approval of the proposal two weeks later in a letter addressed to "Dear Hillary."(1342)

<P>Prior to the discovery of the billing records, Mrs. Clinton claimed in her sworn responses to RTC interrogatories in May 1995 that she called the Arkansas Securities Department to find out "to whom Mr. Massey should direct any inquiries."(1343)  She did not recall to whom she spoke.(1344)

<P>In testimony before the Special Committee, former Commissioner Schaffer directly contradicted Mrs. Clinton and stated that the proposal was discussed during the phone call.  According to Ms. Schaffer:

<P>  [Mrs. Clinton] called and said they had a proposal, and what it was about; and I said I'm familiar with that; I've already looked at that.  You know, I agree with the-basically I have no problem with that position, and you'll be getting a letter soon to that effect. . . .  I think in substance I said, basically,I agree with the position-I mean, that preferred stock can be issued pursuant to the Business Corporation Code.(1345) 



<P>Mr. Massey similarly disputed Mrs. Clinton's account of the phone call to Ms. Schaffer.  Mr. Massey testified that he drafted the proposal and knew exactly to whom the proposal should be sent.(1346)  Mr. Massey further testified that Mrs. Clinton never instructed him about whom to address the transmission letter.(1347)  Mr. Massey did not recall asking Mrs. Clinton to make such an inquiry and was not aware that she had.(1348)



<P>C.<P>Mrs. Clinton's role in Madison's proposed preferred stock deal. 



<P>Mrs. Clinton has minimized her role in the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison before the Arkansas Securities Department in connection with Madison's proposed stock offering.  Although she was the billing partner, Mrs. Clinton has denied that she handled much of the workload on the matter. When asked about the subject during a press conference on April 22, 1994, Mrs. Clinton told reporters that "the young attorney, the young bank officer did all the work. . . . It was not an area that I practiced in it was not an area that I really know anything to speak of about."(1349)

<P>In a 1994 sworn statement to the FDIC, Mrs. Clinton similarly stated: 

<P>While I was the billing partner on the matter, the great bulk of the work was done by Mr. Richard Massey, who was then an associate at the Rose Law Firm and whose specialty was securities law.  I was not involved in the day to day work on that project. . . Mr. Massey primarily handled the matter. . . I was not involved in any meetings with state regulators. . . .(1350)



Mrs. Clinton likewise told RTC investigators in 1994 that Mr. Massey was the lead attorney on the matter.(1351)  And, in sworn interrogatories to the RTC in May 1995, Mrs. Clinton stated, "While I was the billing partner on the matter, the great bulk of the work was done by Mr. Richard Massey, who was then an associate at the Rose Law Firm and whose specialty was securities law."  Mrs. Clinton added that "I was not in charge of the Rose Law Firm's work for Madison Guaranty in 1985-86, although I was the billing partner."(1352)  

<P>The billing records and Mr. Massey's testimony directly contradict Mrs. Clinton's claim that her role on the matter was merely to serve only as a "backstop."  Mrs. Clinton billed 6.2 hours on the preferred stock deal for conferences alone that she had with Mr. McDougal, with Mr. Latham and Davis Fitzhugh, two other Madison S&L officers involved in the stock offering.(1353)  In addition, Mrs. Clinton had at least six conferences with Mr. Massey, the young Rose Law Firm associate on the matter.(1354)  Mrs. Clinton also reviewed the amendments to the application submitted to the Arkansas Securities Department.(1355)

<P>Mr. Massey testified that he did his work under the supervision of Mrs. Clinton.(1356)  According to Mr. Massey, "Mrs. Clinton was the billing attorney and had a relationship with me such that she needed to know what I was doing so she could be prepared to update the client at any time."(1357)  When asked whether Mrs. Clinton's work on the stock proposal deal was "minimal," Mr. Massey responded, "In my own mind it's a significant amount of time."(1358) 

<P>D.<P> Mrs. Clinton's role in the Castle Grande transaction.



<P>Before the billing records were discovered, little was known about the nature of the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison Guaranty in connection with the Castle Grande land transaction.  Perhaps because Mrs. Clinton had ordered the destruction of Madison-related records in 1988, the Rose Law Firm no longer possessed any file related to the Castle Grande deal.

<P>Federal investigators described the Castle Grande transactions as a series of land flips and transactions that cost the American taxpayers $4 million.(1359)  The land deal was designed to conceal Madison Guaranty's investment in Castle Grande through its subsidiary, Madison Financial Corporation.  Mr. Ward was the "straw man" purchaser in the project--one who lends his name to the title, but does not actually have an ownership interest.(1360)  Arkansas regulations limited an S&L's direct investment in its subsidiaries or affiliates to 6 percent of total assets.(1361)   Mr. Ward was needed as the straw man because "had MGSL purchased Castle Grande directly, they would have exceeded their direct investment limit."(1362)  Madison, in effect, paid for Mr. Ward's share in the venture, and was promised $300,000 in commissions for lending his name. 

<P>In 1995, when the RTC asked about her knowledge of Castle Grande, Mrs. Clinton stated "I do not believe I knew anything about any of these real estate parcels and projects." (1363)  The billing records suggest otherwise.

<P>The billing records identify Mrs. Clinton as the billing partner on the matter--even though Mrs. Clinton claimed that she had no idea how the Rose Law Firm became involved in the matter.(1364)  These records indicate that Mrs. Clinton billed more time on the Castle Grande matter--29.5 hours, or 54 percent of total billings on the matter--than any other lawyer at the Rose Law Firm.  Indeed, nearly half of Mrs. Clinton's total billings to Madison were for work on Castle Grande.  In the months following the initial transaction, Mrs. Clinton had at least 12 conferences with Mr. Ward and numerous meetings with Madison officials in connection with the subsequent sales that she billed to the IDC/Castle Grande matter.  One of the conferences with Mr. Ward even related to "the purchase from Brick Lile," the seller of the IDC/Castle Grande property.  Mrs. Clinton also had conferences with two attorneys who were involved in the initial transaction -- Thomas Thrash, the associate at the Rose Law Firm who attended the closing, and Daryl Dover, the attorney for the seller.

<P>In January 1986, Mrs. Clinton tripled Rose's bill to Madison for her work on the Castle Grande/IDC matter without providing any supporting information.  Mrs. Clinton has claimed that this fee, representing 14.5 hours, was for work that she did between January 15 and January 30, 1986, which she forgot to enter on her time sheets as "work in progress."(1365) 

<P>After the discovery of the billing records, Mrs. Clinton attempted to explain the apparent contradiction between her statements about her minimal involvement in the Castle Grande transaction and the billing records.  In a television interview, Mrs. Clinton explained that she did not know the Castle Grande property by this name, and that the matter she worked on was known by the name of the seller, IDC.  She explained that it was a "separate deal" entirely: 

<P>Again, there's not a contradiction.  Castle Grande was a trailer park on a piece of property that was about 1,000 acres big.  I never did work for Castle Grande.  Never at all.  And so, when I was asked about it last year, I didn't recognize it, I didn't remember it.  The billing records show I did not do work for Castle Grande.  I did work for something called IDC, which was not related to Castle Grande. . . . Separate deal completely.(1366)  

When asked by the Pillsbury Firm what she meant by "separate deal," Mrs. Clinton gave a similar answer:

<P>Well, my understanding is that the work for Madison concerned property that was referred to then at the time and continually by the Rose Firm as IDC or Industrial Development Corporation property.  I know that work as IDC.  That's how it was billed.  And I did not know that there was something called Castle Grande, to the best of my recollection, until it came to my attention through these investigations, the entire thousand acres that we referred to as IDC was being called Castle Grande . . . .



<P>I was informed sometime within the last year or two that there was a trailer park on the IDC property called Castle Grande Estates.  To the best of my recollection, that was the first I had ever heard of Castle Grande Estates.(1367) 



<P>Substantial evidence, however, contradicts Mrs. Clinton's statements concerning the name of this project.  Madison Guaranty officials and federal regulators all commonly referred to the entire parcel of land as "Castle Grande."  Television advertisements in Little Rock promoting the land development referred to the land as "Castle Grande."  Susan McDougal told ABC news that the entire development was considered "Castle Grande."  Internal Madison Board Minutes dated September 12, 1985, referred to  "Castle Grande Estates."  Harry Don Denton, a Madison officer, testified at the Tucker-McDougal trial that the entire property was named Castle Grande immediately after its purchase from IDC.(1368)  Finally, records reflecting a meeting between Alston Jennings, former attorney for Mr. Ward, and Mr. Kendall, the Clintons' attorney, on January 11, 1996--the week after the billing records were discovered--referred to "Castle Grande."(1369)  No mention was made of IDC.(1370)

<P>More important than the mere extent of her services related to the Castle Grande, however, is the nature of her work.  For his role as the "straw man" and other related services to the project, Mr. Ward was owed a commission.  On March 31, 1986, Madison Guaranty loaned $400,000 to Mr. Ward.(1371)  One week later, on April 7, 1986, Madison Financial Corporation, a subsidiary of Madison Guaranty, executed two promissory notes, for $300,000 and $70,943, purporting to reflect loans from Mr. Ward to Madison Financial.(1372)  Thus, except approximately $30,000 for administrative expenses, the two Madison Financial notes offset Mr. Ward's debt to Madison Guaranty.  At the end of the day, Mr. Ward kept the bulk of the $400,000 as his commission for the Castle Grande fraud.

<P>At about this time, bank examiners were auditing Madison Guaranty's books, and James Clark, the chief examiner, asked whether the three notes were related.(1373)  Madison official, Mr. Denton, assured him that these notes were not related.(1374)  According to Madison official John Latham, however, the three notes were related, and the $400,000 March 31 loan from Madison Guaranty was intended to pay Mr. Ward's commissions.(1375)

<P>The Rose Law Firm billing records revealed for the first time that on April 7, 1986, the day the Madison Financial notes were executed, Mrs. Clinton billed 10 minutes to the IDC/Castle Grande matter for "Telephone conference with Don Denton."(1376)  A message slip produced by Mr. Denton reflects that Mrs. Clinton called him from the Rose Law Firm on April 7, 1986.(1377) In a June 11, 1996 interview with FDIC investigators, Mr. Denton stated that Mrs. Clinton called seeking copies of the notes between Mr. Ward, Madison Financial, and Madison Guaranty.(1378)  Mr. Denton told investigators that during the conversation he cautioned Mrs. Clinton that a problem might exist with respect to the April 7th notes to Mr. Ward because "they constituted in effect a parent entity fulfilling the obligation of a subsidiary,"(1379) a violation of the so-called direct investment rule.  Mrs. Clinton, however, "summarily dismissed" that concern in a way that he took to mean that "he would take care of savings and loan matters, and she would take care of legal matters."(1380)

<P>The billing records showed that on May 1, 1986, Mrs. Clinton billed Madison Guaranty for two hours for the following work: "Conference with Seth Ward; telephone conference with Seth Ward regarding option; telephone conference with Mike Shauffler; prepare option."(1381)  Indeed, a May 1 option agreement between Mr. Ward and Madison Financial bore a word processing code ("0190g") that, according to the Rose Law Firm's counsel, indicates the document was created at the Rose Law Firm by or for Mrs. Clinton.(1382)<P>  The May 1st agreement gave Madison an option from Mr. Ward to convey his portion of the Castle Grande property back to Madison.  Mr. Clark, the bank examiner, told investigators that, after reviewing the records and in light of Mr. Denton' testimony, he believed that the May 1st option prepared by Mrs. Clinton "was created `in order to conceal the connection--whatever it was--between'" the March 31st and April 7th notes.(1383)

<P>On June 13, 1996, in light of the significant new evidence offered by Mr. Denton and Mr. Clark relating to the extent and nature of Mrs. Clinton's role in Castle Grande, the Special Committee requested that Mrs. Clinton "refresh her memory about these transactions, and to inform the Special Committee of what she recalls about them" in writing, under oath."(1384)  In her response affidavit, Mrs. Clinton did not answer the question, but simply referred to her attorney's transmittal letter "addressing certain allegations recently made by Mr. Don Denton."(1385)  In his letter, Mr. Kendall maintained that Mr. Denton's recollection is "wholly unreliable"66  but gave no indication as to the recollection of the First Lady.(1386)  Mrs. Clinton, therefore, has neither denied nor confirmed Mr. Denton's account.  

IV.<P>The Federal Investigations into the Rose Law Firm's Representation of Madison.

<P>When the FDIC assumed control of Madison in 1989, Madison had a pending lawsuit against its former independent accountants, Frost & Company ("Frost").(1387)  The suit was filed in 1988 by the Memphis law firm of Gerrish & McCreary and alleged malpractice on the part of Frost in connection with its audits of Madison performed in 1984 and 1985.(1388)  The Frost litigation was assigned to FDIC attorney April Breslaw, who removed Gerrish & McCreary from the case and hired the Rose Law Firm to handle the matter.(1389)  Rose partner Webster Hubbell was the billing partner and lead trial counsel on the case.(1390)  Although the original claim was for $10 million, Rose settled the case in late February 1991 for $1.025 million.(1391)  The firm was paid $375,380 for its work.(1392)

<P>In 1994, the FDIC Office of the Inspector General ("FDIC-IG") and the RTC-IG began investigations into possible conflicts of interests related to the Rose's representation of those agencies in the Frost litigation.

<P>During a February 24, 1994 hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Ranking Member Alfonse D'Amato raised questions about a February 17, 1994 report of the FDIC Legal Division regarding the FDIC's hiring of Rose as counsel with respect to Madison.(1393)  This report was prompted by stories appearing in the media in late 1993 and early 1994 alleging that Rose had failed to disclose conflicts related to its representation of Madison before the Arkansas Securities Department and the litigation against Madison brought by Mr. Hubbell's father-in-law, Seth Ward.(1394)  The FDIC Legal Division concluded that neither Rose's representation of Madison before the Arkansas Securities Department nor Mr. Ward's suit against Madison constituted a conflict.(1395)  At Senator D'Amato's urging,(1396) then FDIC Acting Chairman Andrew C. Hove agreed to ask the FDIC-IG to conduct an investigation.(1397)

<P>On February 8, 1994, the RTC's Office of Contractor Oversight and Surveillance ("OCOS") issued a report dismissing allegations of conflicts of interest related to Rose's representation of the RTC in the Frost case.(1398)  On February 24, 1994, RTC Interim Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") Roger Altman agreed to ask the RTC-IG to review the OCOS Report.(1399)  On March 2, 1994, RTC Deputy and Acting CEO John Ryan requested that the RTC-IG investigate the matters raised in the OCOS Report.(1400)

<P>The FDIC-IG issued its report on July 28, 1995, days before Ms. Huber discovered the billing records in the Book Room of the White House Residence.  In the course of its investigation, the IG reviewed (1) the alleged conflicts of interest related to the FDIC's retention of Rose; (2) the FDIC Legal Division's conflicts report; (3) and certain legal fee payments made by the FDIC to Rose.(1401)  

<P>With respect to the conflicts related to the FDIC's retention of Rose, the IG concluded that the Rose Law Firm and, specifically, that Mr. Hubbell had failed, as required by ethical rules, to disclose the firm's prior representation of Madison.  The FDIC-IG reported:

<P>The results of our investigation evidenced conflicting relationships among the Rose Law Firm, Rose partner Webster L. Hubbell, and Mr. Hubbell's father-in-law since 1971, Seth Ward.  During the time that Mr. Hubbell represented the Madison Conservatorship on behalf of the FDIC, Mr. Hubbell's father-in-law was engaged in litigation adverse to the Madison Conservatorship.  We found that neither the Firm nor Mr. Hubbell had informed FDIC of these relationships when the Firm was hired in March 1989 to handle the lawsuit against Frost or while the Firm was acting as litigator for the Madison Conservatorship.(1402)

The report further found that Mr. Hubbell's representation of the FDIC was improper in light of Rose's prior representation of Mr. McDougal's S&L:  

<P>The results of our investigation also evidenced conflicting representations on the part of the Rose Law Firm with respect to its representation of FDIC regarding the Madison Conservatorship.  Specifically, we found that the Firm had represented Madison and its wholly owned subsidiary, Madison Financial Corporation, in 1985 and 1986 on various legal matters, including representation of Madison in 1985 before the Arkansas Securities Department (ASD).  During its 1985 representation of Madison the Firm submitted materials to the ASD which were prepared by Frost, the firm that was later sued by Rose on behalf of FDIC for the Madison Conservatorship.  We further found that for many years the Rose Law Firm represented Mr. Hubbell's father-in-law, Seth Ward, or Mr. Ward's companies regarding various legal matters.  However, there was no evidence to show that Mr. Hubbell or the Rose Law Firm disclosed these representations to FDIC when the Firm was hired or during its representation of the Madison Conservatorship in the Frost lawsuit.(1403)



<P>In its review of the FDIC Legal Division's February 17, 1994 Report, the FDIC-IG determined that the Legal Division failed to consider certain conflicts criteria and additional evidence obtained by the IG.(1404) 

<P>The RTC-IG, after a separate investigation, issued its report on August 3, 1995--again days before someone placed the billing records in the Book Room.67   The RTC-IG found that "Rose Law Firm did not disclose actual or potential conflicts relating to Madison and another six of the 17 institutions for which the firm represented FDIC and RTC."(1405)  

<P>Among the "undisclosed" matters identified by the RTC-IG Report related to Rose's involvement in the Castle Grande land deal:

<P>At the time it assisted MADISON GUARANTY with the CASTLE GRANDE deal, ROSE LAW FIRM was aware of regulatory concerns about the soundness of the institution, particularly its net worth, through its representation of MADISON GUARANTY on applications with the ARKANSAS SECURITIES DEPARTMENT to issue preferred stock and to commence broker/dealer operations.  Although FROST & COMPANY's defense called the conduct of MADISON GUARANTY management into question and ROSE LAW FIRM had represented MADISON GUARANTY/MADISON FINANCIAL/SETH WARD in an acquisition of property orchestrated by that management and subsequently heavily criticized by the regulators, ROSE LAW FIRM did not disclose fully its relationship with MADISON GUARANTY in the purchase and development of the IDC property to FDIC or RTC when it was retained in the suit against FROST & COMPANY.(1406)

 

<P>Mr. Adair, Inspector General of the RTC, provided further explanation of the conflicts problem posed by Rose's involvement in Castle Grande in his testimony before the House Banking Committee in August 1995:

<P><P>Arkansas State Regulations had prohibited Madison Guaranty from acquiring a tract of property that became known as Castle Grande, and as an entity the Rose Law Firm was aware of this restriction because it had previously represented Madison Guaranty in other work involving the Arkansas Securities Department.



<P><P>According to a subsequent Home Loan Bank Board examination that was done, to avoid this restriction, Madison Guaranty assigned the right to purchase part of the property to an employee of the institution who was the father-in-law of a Rose partner.



<P><P>Madison Guaranty financed 100 percent of that employee's purchase, providing over $1 million in non-recourse financing and obtained an option from the employee to convey the property back to Madison Guaranty.



<P><P>Essentially, the purchase appears to have been structured to avoid violation of state law by Madison Guaranty.  Madison Guaranty paid the Rose Law Firm for legal services in connection with the transaction.



<P><P>In a report of examination of March 1986, Federal Home Loan Bank Board examiners identified this transaction as one of a series of fictitious transactions causing losses to Madison Guaranty.



<P><P>When Madison Guaranty's independent public accountant was sued by FDIC for its part in the failure of the institution, the accounting firm's defense called the conduct of Madison Guaranty's management into question for several transactions including Castle Grande.



<P><P>Although the Rose Law Firm had earlier assisted Madison Guaranty management in the original Castle Grande transaction, the Rose Law Firm did not disclose its role in that transaction when later retained by the FDIC in the malpractice suit against Madison Guaranty's independent public accountant.(1407)



<P>On December 29, 1995, RTC General Counsel William Collishaw informed the Arkansas Supreme Court Committee on Professional Conduct that the RTC-IG Report "provides a sufficient indication of the existence of possible undisclosed conflicts of interest by the Rose Law Firm such that it raises concerns about the Rose Law Firm's compliance with the Arkansas Rules of Professional Conduct."(1408)  The matter is still pending before the Committee on Professional Conduct.(1409)

<P>Relying primarily on the report of the RTC-IG, the Pillsbury Firm reviewed Rose's representation of the FDIC and the RTC.(1410)  Pillsbury determined that "[b]etween the time the Rose Law Firm was substituted in and the time the Frost case settled, the Rose Law Firm developed an impermissible conflict of interest, which it neither fully disclosed to its client, the RTC, nor had waived."(1411)  Pillsbury concluded that "[a] claim could be asserted against the Rose Law Firm with respect to the conflict of interest."(1412)  Specifically, Pillsbury identified Seth Ward and the Castle Grande transaction as among the factors leading to its conclusion that Rose had a conflict of interest.(1413)

<P>Ms. Black, counsel to the RTC-IG, stressed the significance of the billing records found in the Book Room of the White House to her investigation.  She explained that the records related to the key transactions at issue in the allegations of conflicts of interest:

<P><P>The investigation which we were performing in 1994 and completed in the summer of 1995 was an investigation of actual or potential conflicts that the Rose Law Firm might have had with regard to its work for initially the FDIC and then the RTC.  As a part of that investigation, we looked at the firm's work for Madison Guaranty.  We also looked at the firm's work, if any, for Seth Ward.



<P><P>We looked at various transactions, including Castle Grande, IDC, the Frost litigation, the representation before the Arkansas Security Department and general work that they did for Madison Guaranty.  These records -- the records that were available to us at the time we were doing our investigation were very sparse.  It was very difficult for us to understand what the Rose Law Firm had in fact done.  We had no more than a handful of invoices, five or six.(1414)



Ms. Black stated that the billing records were the best available evidence of the work Rose performed for Madison and that those records were "considerably more detailed than what was available to us before."(1415)  

<P>Ms. Black testified that if the RTC-IG had the billing records during its investigation, "certainly there would have been questions that we asked witnesses that we did not ask.  There would have been lines of inquiry that we would have pursued that we did not pursue.  There might have been witnesses that we would have asked to interview that we did not ask to interview."(1416)

<P>In particular, the Rose billing records increased the RTC-IG's knowledge of Mrs. Clinton's role in Rose's representation of Madison.  When Ms. Black testified before the House Banking Committee in August 1995 about her report, all that she could say was that Mrs. Clinton worked for Madison.  "We don't know what it was.  The bills that were submitted by Rose had the names of attorneys who did the work at the top, and then they had a block discussion of the activities that occurred, and we don't know who did what."(1417)  Ms. Black further testified in 1995 that "[w]e have no evidence that she [Hillary Clinton] worked on Castle Grande."(1418)

<P><P>After the billing records were discovered, Ms. Black testified that the RTC-IG learned, for the first time, of the following relevant matters:

<P>*<P>Mrs. Clinton's role in drafting the May 1, 1986 option agreement between Madison and Seth Ward;



<P>*<P>Mrs. Clinton's telephone conference with Beverly Bassett Schaffer the day before the Rose Law Firm sent a letter to Ms. Schaffer requesting approval of Madison's plan to issue a series of preferred stock;



<P>*<P>Mrs. Clinton's review of a letter discussing the Arkansas banking regulation which limited direct investments by an S&L in an affiliate or subsidiary; and

 

<P>*<P>Mrs. Clinton 15 conferences, either in person or on the telephone, with Seth Ward, the key player in the Castle Grande deal.(1419)



Ms. Black stated that the RTC-IG would have interviewed Mrs. Clinton if it had the billing records during its investigation.(1420)

V.<P>The Special Committee's Investigation into the Circumstances Surrounding the Discovery of the Billing Records.

<P>The FDIC-IG issued its report on the Rose Law Firm's conflicts of interest stemming from its representation of Madison on July 28, 1995.  The RTC-IG issued its report on the same matter on August 3, 1995.  During the two week period following the publication of these reports, Ms. Huber first saw the billing records in the Book Room of the White House Residence, next to Mrs. Clinton's office.

<P>The Special Committee conducted hearings in December 1995 into matters relating to the Rose Law Firm and Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison.  Specific questions were raised regarding the existence of the billing records.  Mr. Hubbell claimed that he could not provide complete answers about the Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison because he did not have the billing records to refresh his memory.(1421)  Ms. Thomases similarly testified about her campaign notes relating to billing records reflecting Mrs. Clinton's work for Madison.(1422)  About two weeks later, on January 4, 1996, Ms. Huber examined the records she recovered from the Book Room and realized that they were the missing billing records.(1423)

<P>Because of the importance of the records and the mysterious circumstances of their disappearance and discovery, the Special Committee conducted an exhaustive investigation to identify the person or persons who removed them from the Rose Law Firm in 1992 and who placed them in the Book Room of the White House Residence in August 1995.

<P>The White House produced to the Special Committee records reflecting all persons who entered the White House Residence from July 20 through August 14, 1995.(1424)  The White House provided lists of construction workers who were on the payroll of contractors performing renovations in the White House Residence during this period.(1425)  Finally, the White House produced lists of overnight guests of President and Mrs. Clinton during this period.(1426)

<P>The White House informed the Special Committee that approximately 206 persons had access to the Book Room during the relevant period from July 20 to August 14, 1995, when Ms. Huber testified she found the billing records.(1427)

<P>Of the 206 persons with access to the Bookroom during the relevant period, 28 were White House Residence Staff.(1428)  The Chief Usher, Gary Walters, testified that the Residence staff may not place documents in, or move documents around, the White House Residence without authorization.(1429)  According to Mr. Walters, it is highly unlikely that a member of the Residence staff placed the records in the Book Room.(1430)  Because the White House Residence employees would have had little opportunity to gain access to the billing records and no reason to place them in the Book Room, the Special Committee concluded that no residence employee placed the billing records in the Book Room.

<P>After eliminating the 28 members of the Residence Staff, 178 persons remained.  Of those, approximately 30 construction workers, who were involved in ongoing work in the Book Room or in the adjacent Exercise Room, were given access to the Book Room.  Dennis Freemyer, the Deputy Head Usher in charge of construction projects, testified that the construction workers and outside contractors were all instructed not to touch or move anything in the White House Residence.(1431)  According to Mr. Freemyer: "They are asked not to touch anything.  If they need something moved, they're to ask either the National Park Service or a member of our staff, if they are present."(1432)  All construction workers and outside contractors were escorted by either Secret Service or White House Ushers at all times while they were in the Residence.(1433)  For security reasons, the escorts specifically check at the completion of each day's work to ascertain whether the workers had left anything behind.(1434)  According to Mr. Freemyer, it is highly unlikely that a construction worker or outside contractor placed the records in the Book Room.(1435)  Because the outside contractors had no opportunity to gain access to the billing records or reason for placing them in the Book Room, the Special Committee concluded that no outside contractor placed the records in the Book Room.

<P>After eliminating the construction workers, 148 persons remained, including 55 public officials.(1436)  These public officials included 24 U.S. mayors, President and Mrs. Kim of South Korea, and various Cabinet officials and National Security Staff.(1437)  Given their official positions and their lack of access to the billing records or motive to place them in the Book Room, the Special Committee concluded that none of these individuals placed the Rose Law Firm billing records in the Book Room.

<P>Of the remaining 93 persons who had access to the White House residence during the period from July 20 through August 14, 1995, records of the Secret Service and the White House Usher's Office identified 60 Residence guests.(1438)  The Special Committee sent interrogatories to these guests.  Each guest responded that he or she did not handle the records, have any discussions about the records, or have any knowledge of how they came to appear in the Book Room of the White House Residence.

<P>Apart from the Residence guests, construction workers, and staff, the remaining 33 individuals who had access to the Book Room during the relevant period had a past or present working relationship with the President and the First Lady. Of these 33 persons, the Special Committee received evidence from all except the President and the First Lady.  Ten were sent interrogatories, and the others gave testimony directly to the Special Committee.  All denied having handled the records, having any discussions about the records,68  or having any knowledge about how the records appeared in the Book Room of the White House Residence.

<P>The President and Mrs. Clinton are the only persons on the list of 206 persons having access to the White House Residence from whom the Special Committee has not received evidence.  On June 13, 1996, the Special Committee requested that Mrs. Clinton respond in writing, under oath, about "any knowledge she may have concerning the Rose Law Firm billing records bearing Bates Stamp numbers DKSN028928 through DKSN029043, including whether she has reviewed, handled, or discussed (other than with counsel) these records, and her knowledge relating to the disappearance or discovery of these records."(1439)  

<P>On June 17, 1996, Mrs. Clinton responded: "I do not know how the billing records (DKSN028928 through DKSN029043) came to be identified by Mrs. Huber at the White House on January 4, 1996, although I have read various media accounts."  In light of the Special Committee's request for detailed and specific information relating to any knowledge she had concerning the disappearance or discovery of these records, Mrs. Clinton's answer is incomplete.  For example, she does not state whether she has any knowledge as to how the billing records were removed from the Rose Law Firm; who possessed the billing records between February 1992 and August 1995; where they were stored between February 1992 and August 1995; and, most importantly, who placed them in the Book Room of the White House in August 1995.  There is no mystery as to how Ms. Huber came to identify the records on January 4, 1996.  These other, more important questions, however, remain to be answered.

<P>On June 4, 1996, the FBI informed the Special Committee that the fingerprints of six persons were found on the Rose billing records discovered in the Book Room.(1440)  In addition to fingerprints of Ms. Huber and Marc Rolfe, a Williams & Connolly legal assistant who stamped numbers on the records to prepare them for production,(1441) the FBI also identified the fingerprint of Sandra Hatch, a Rose Law Firm file clerk assigned to Mr. Foster in 1992,(1442) and a palm print of Mildred Alston, Mrs. Clinton's Rose Law Firm secretary and currently Special Assistant for White House Personal Correspondence.(1443)  

<P>Ms. Hatch testified that, as Mr. Foster's file clerk, she was often asked by Mr. Foster or his secretary to photocopy documents and files--which, on occasions, included timesheets and billing records of the size and description similar to those found in the White House Book Room.(1444)  She did not, however, recall a specific instance when Mr. Foster asked her to photocopy or handle such records.(1445)  She did not recall handling, discussing, or overhearing any discussions about records specifically relating to the Rose Law Firm's work for Madison.(1446)  Ms. Hatch testified that although she packed some of Mr. Foster's personal files from the Rose Law Firm for shipment to the White House in January 1993, she did not, see any records resembling the billing records discovered in the Book Room.(1447)  She had no knowledge of how the billing records got to the White House Residence.(1448)  When asked to speculate how her fingerprint got onto the billing records, Ms. Hatch replied, "It's very possible I could have been asked to pick them up.  I don't know.  It would just be a guess."(1449)  

<P>Mildred Alston testified that, although she had been to Mrs. Clinton's office on the third floor of the White House Residence, she had never been to the adjacent Book Room.(1450)  Prior to her appearance before the Grand Jury in 1996, Ms. Alston had never seen the billing records discovered in the Book Room since she came to Washington.(1451)  She did see and handle records resembling those found in the Book Room while she worked at the Rose Law Firm,(1452) and speculated that "I'm sure if the tests indicate that my palm print is wherever on this piece of paper, or on the original of this piece of paper, then I handled them, or touched them or leaned on them" while she was at the Rose Law Firm.(1453)  Ms. Alston testified that, in January 1992, she helped pack Mrs. Clinton's documents and left some of them in the custody of Amy Stewart, a Rose lawyer, to be shipped to the White House.(1454)  Ms. Alston did not know whether the billing records found in the Book Room were among the files shipped to the White House from Mrs. Clinton's officeat the Rose Law Firm.(1455)

<P>The FBI also identified the fingerprints of Mrs. Clinton and Vincent Foster on the billing records.(1456)  Mr. Foster received the billing records in during the 1992 Presidential campaign, and was the last known person to have handled the records.(1457)  Lawyers for the Clintons, both from the White House and from Williams & Connolly, have stated that Mrs. Clinton "may have handled the billing records in 1992."(1458)  What is left unanswered by this statement, however, are the critical questions concerning the mystery of the billing records: when did Mrs. Clinton handle them?  Why did she handle them?  And specifically, what information was she attempting to glean from them?

<P>A close analysis of the billing records, Mr. Foster's notations, and the location of Mrs. Clinton's and Mr. Foster's fingerprints reveal at least some answers to these questions.  The records disclose Mrs. Clinton's role in advising Mr. McDougal's Castle Grande transaction and they indicate Mrs. Clinton's and Mr. Foster's concern over Mrs. Clintons' involvement in the transactions.

<P>Mrs. Clinton left her fingerprints at two places on the billing records.  The FBI identified "[o]ne fingerprint located on the front bottom near the left edge of the page DEK 014950."(1459)  At approximately this location on the page,69  is an entry reflecting that Mrs. Clinton participated in a "teleconference with B. Bassett, Securities Commissioner."(1460)  The entry is underlined in an unidentified hand, but the presence of Mrs. Clinton's fingerprint at this approximate location, and the absence of any other identifiable finger print on the page,(1461) strongly suggest that Mrs. Clinton made the markings.

<P>This entry on the billing records, for upwards of one hour on the day before Rose submitted Madison's novel preferred stock proposal to Ms. Schaffer,(1462) contradicts Mrs. Clinton's response to RTC interrogatories that in May 1995, when she called the Arkansas Securities Department to find out "to whom Mr. Massey should direct any inquiries," she did not recall to whom she spoke.(1463)  Mrs. Clinton's sworn statement is contrary to the testimony of the other two participants in the telephone conference, Ms. Schaffer and Mr. Massey.(1464)  Ms. Schaffer, in particular, testified that she substantively discussed the legality of the preferred stock proposal.(1465)

<P>Mrs. Clinton's fingerprints and the markings on the billing records at this entry indicate that Mrs. Clinton was aware of the nature of her contact with Ms. Schaffer as recently as February 1992, three years before her sworn answer to the RTC interrogatories.  Ms. Schaffer recalled the substance of the conversation from over ten years ago, and it is unclear why Mrs. Clinton provided inaccurate information to the RTC on the conversations about which she had substantive knowledge as recently as 1992.

<P>Mr. Foster's fingerprints on the billing records indicate his attention to Mrs. Clinton's role with respect to the Castle Grande transaction, a "land flip" deal that federal regulators have described as a fraud costing the taxpayers $4 million.(1466)  The transaction was fraudulently structured to evade Arkansas' "direct investment" rule, which limits an S&L's investment in its subsidiaries and service corporations.(1467)

<P>The FBI identified "[o]ne fingerprint on the front lower right corner of page DEK 014969" belonging to Mr. Foster.(1468)  At approximately this location on the page,70  is an entry reflecting that Mr. Massey participated in a conference with Sarah Hawkins, a Madison official, and the Federal Home Loan Bank "regarding brokerage activities and direct investment rule."(1469)  The entire entry is circled, most probably by Mr. Foster, given the presence of his fingerprint proximate to the entry.  The markings suggest that Mr. Foster recognized the significance of the direct investment rule as it related to the activities of Madison.

<P>The importance of Mr. Foster's recognition as it related to Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison becomes clear with the FBI's identification of "[o]ne fingerprint on the front upper right corner of page DEK 015030" belonging to Mr. Foster.(1470)  At approximately this location on the page71  is an entry reflecting that Mrs. Clinton had a telephone conference with Donald Denton, a Madison official, for approximately 12 minutes on April 7, 1986.(1471)  Someone, apparently Mr. Foster, circled the name of the attorney on the entry: "HRC."(1472)

<P>This telephone call is among the critical events in illuminating the nature of Mrs. Clinton's work in connection with the fraudulent Castle Grande transaction.  The land deal, as noted above, was a sham transaction designed to conceal Madison Guaranty's investment in Castle Grande through its subsidiary, Madison Financial.  Mr. Ward was the "straw man" purchaser in the project--one who lends his name to the title, but does not actually have an ownership interest.(1473)  In order to conceal the commissions owed to Mr. Ward for his services, Madison Guaranty, Madison Financial, and Mr. Ward executed a three promissory notes purporting to evidence loans but, in fact, were a means to pay Mr. Ward for his commissions.  Two of these notes were executed on April 7, 1986.  

<P>That same day, Mr. Denton, Madison's loan officer, received a message from Mrs. Clinton.(1474)  According to Mr. Denton, Mrs. Clinton called seeking copies of the April 7th notes between Mr. Ward and Madison Financial.(1475)  When Mr. Denton cautioned Mrs. Clinton that the April 7th notes from Madison to Mr. Ward may pose a problem because "they constituted in effect a parent entity fulfilling the obligation of a subsidiary,"(1476) Mrs. Clinton "summarily dismissed" Mr. Denton's warning.(1477)  She replied in a manner he took to mean that "he would take care of savings and loan matters, and she would take care of legal matters."(1478)

<P>She indeed took care of matters.  The Rose Law Firm billing records indicate that, three weeks later, on May 1, 1986, Mrs. Clinton prepared an option agreement between Mr. Ward and Madison Financial.(1479)  The word "HRC" in the entry was, as in the April 7th entry, circled apparently by the same hand.(1480)  Based on the new evidence derived from Mr. Denton and the billing records, the federal regulator who examined Madison in 1986 believed that Mrs. Clinton's May 1 option "was created `in order to conceal the connection--whatever it was--between'" the March 31 and April 7 notes.(1481)

<P>On June 13, 1996, the Special Committee requested that the First Lady attempt to refresh her recollection regarding the matters discussed by Mr. Denton and to inform the Committee of what she recalls about them.(1482)  On June 17, 1996 the Special Committee received an affidavit from Mrs. Clinton accompanied by a letter from Mr. Kendall.  In the affidavit, Mrs. Clinton gave no answer to the question posed by the Special Committee; instead, she simply referred to Mr. Kendall's letter "addressing certain allegations recently made by Mr. Don Denton."(1483)  In his letter, Mr. Kendall maintained that Mr. Denton's recollection is "wholly unreliable"72  but gave no indication as to the recollection of the First Lady.(1484)  The First Lady thus has neither confirmed nor denied Mr. Denton's testimony.  

<P>The significance of the billing records as they relate to Castle Grande is perhaps best illustrated by the activities of Mrs. Clinton's legal defense team immediately after the discovery of the records.  A message slip from John Tisdale, the Clintons' Arkansas lawyer to Alston Jennings, Seth Ward's former attorney on Castle Grande, indicate that, on June 5, 1996, the day after Ms. Huber discovered the records in her White House office, Mr. Kendall called Mr. Tisdale and Mr. Jennings to arrange a meeting.(1485)  One week after the records were discovered, on January 11, 1996, Mr. Kendall flew to Little Rock and met first with Mr. Jennings and then with Mr. Ward.(1486)  The meeting with Mr. Ward lasted 30-40 minutes.(1487)  Curiously, Mr. Kendall had also contacted Mr. Jennings in August 1995.  Subsequent to that contact, Mrs. Clinton summoned Mr. Jennings to the White House for a personal meeting on August 10, 1995, around the time that the billing records were placed in the Book Room of the White House residence.

<P>Mrs. Clinton, as the billing partner and lead attorney for Rose on the matter, most likely would have appreciated the importance of the billing records and the information they impart on Castle Grande.  What remains unanswered is how Mr. Foster gained knowledge of the significance of these transaction--sufficient knowledge apparently to highlight the entry on the billing records for Mrs. Clinton's April 7th telephone call with Mr. Denton and for her preparation of the May 1 option.  Given that Mr. Foster's directed his handwritten notes on the billing records to Mrs. Clinton, the most reasonable inference is that Mrs. Clinton shared her recollection of the transactions with Mr. Foster, and the two collaborated in reviewing the billing records some time after February 1992.  If that is so, then the question arises as to why Mrs. Clinton stated to investigators in 1995 that "I do not believe I knew anything about any of these real estate parcels and projects."(1488)

<P>The billing records, and the evidence from Mr. Denton which the entries on the billing records elicited, indicate that Mrs. Clinton either had knowledge of or consciously avoided the fact that the Castle Grande transactions potentially violated bank regulations.  That knowledge provides a powerful motive to protect the billing records from careful scrutiny by investigators.  Because Mrs. Clinton had ordered the destruction of other documents relating to Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison--including her timesheets and other work files directly relating to Castle Grande--the billing records were the only documentary evidence available which reflected the true extent and nature of Mrs. Clinton's role with respect to the fraudulent scheme.

<P>The evidence strongly suggests that Mr. Foster and Mrs. Clinton, at some time after February 1992, worked together to reconstruct Mrs. Clinton's role in Castle Grande.  The evidence also indicates that Mr. Foster and Mrs. Clinton appreciated the significance of Mrs. Clinton's April 7 telephone call to Mr. Denton and her preparation of the May 1 option, in the words of a federal regulator, "to conceal" the true nature of the transaction.(1489)  Both had a powerful motive to protect the billing records from scrutiny.  Mr. Foster is now deceased.<P>

<P>The Special Committee's Arkansas Phase focused on the core allegations of improprieties and criminal misconduct concerning the activities of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association ("Madison Guaranty"), Whitewater Development Corporation ("Whitewater"), Capital Management Services, Inc. ("CMS") and Lasater & Co.  The Arkansas Phase was the last phase of the Committee's inquiry, and, in deference to the Independent Counsel's ongoing investigation, the Committee did not investigate thoroughly certain matters specified in Resolution 120, particularly the lending activities of the Perry County Bank in connection with 1990 Arkansas gubernatorial election.

<P>The convictions of three of the President and Mrs. Clinton's close Arkansas business and political associates in the recently concluded Tucker-McDougal trial in Little Rock marked a key turning point in the ongoing Whitewater affair.  The jury's guilty findings against Governor Jim Guy Tucker and James and Susan McDougal, the Clintons' Whitewater business partners, demonstrate the seriousness of the matters under investigation in the Committee's Arkansas Phase.  Simply put, Whitewater can longer be responsibly dismissed as "a cover-up without a crime."

<P> The Arkansas jury unanimously concluded that James McDougal operated Madison Guaranty as, in effect, a criminal enterprise.  The failure of Madison Guaranty cost American taxpayers more than $60 million.  It is now clear that Madison and CMS, a small business investment company run by David Hale, were piggy banks for the Arkansas political elite.

<P>Eight of the 24 counts of conviction relate directly to the Clintons' investment in Whitewater.  The jury convicted on all of the counts concerning a loan from CMS to Susan McDougal's firm, Master Marketing.  According to the testimony of an FBI agent at the Tucker-McDougal trial, approximately $50,000 of the loan was used to pay the expenses of Whitewater.  Moreover, Mr. Hale testified at the trial that he discussed this fraudulent loan with then-Governor Clinton.  Unfortunately, the Committee never heard the important testimony of Mr. Hale, who asserted his constitutional right not to testify.  The Committee was unable to secure sufficient votes to grant Mr. Hale limited use immunity.

<P>The recently-discovered Rose Law Firm billing records provide important new evidence relating to the Arkansas Phase.  The records reveal Mrs. Clinton's previously undisclosed personal representation of Mr. McDougal's S&L before state regulators, seeking permission to raise additional money through the sale of stock.  The records also show that Mrs. Clinton was repeatedly called on to do work related to the Madison land deal, known as Castle Grande, which federal S&L regulators found involved a series of fraudulent transactions.  The Special Committee concludes that Mrs. Clinton's work on Castle Grande related to an effort to conceal the true nature of activities at Madison Guaranty.

<P>The Special Committee also uncovered evidence that Mr. Clinton himself took an active role in obtaining one of the original Whitewater loans -- one apparently approved as a favor after the bank's political lobbyist intervened.  And Mr. Clinton's accountant testified that when he raised objections to early parts of Mr. McDougal's Whitewater proposal, Mr. Clinton pulled him aside and told him to "back off."

<P>During the 1980s, Mr. McDougal and his allies obtained favorable results from their dealings with the Arkansas state government under Governor Clinton.  At a time when Mr. McDougal was carrying the Clintons on their Whitewater loans, Mr. McDougal had a say in the making of state appointments, enjoyed personal access to the Governor and won valuable state leases for Madison.  The Special Committee concludes that Governor Clinton's official and personal dealings with Mr. McDougal raised an apparent, if not an actual, improper conflict of interest. 

<P>Finally, the Clinton were not "passive" investors in the Whitewater real estate venture, as they have claimed.  Indeed, the Clintons participated in important meetings concerning the Whitewater investment.  The Special Committee concludes that the Clintons took an active role in obtaining and extending Whitewater-related loans.<P><P> 

<P>*   *   *

1.<P>Mrs. Clinton's legal work on Castle Grande related to an effort to conceal the true nature of the activities at Madison Guaranty.



<P>The Castle Grande land development consisted of more than 1,000 acres of property near Little Rock purchased by Seth Ward, Webster Hubbell's father-in-law, and Madison Financial Corp. ("MFC") -- Madison Guaranty's wholly-owned subsidiary.7  The land was sold in a series of transactions that caused nearly $4 million in losses to Madison Guaranty -- losses ultimately borne by U.S. taxpayers.8

<P>Federal regulators have determined that Seth Ward acted as a "straw" man in the fraudulent Castle Grande transaction who simply held property in his name until MFC could find a buyer.9  In this way, Madison Guaranty was able to circumvent an Arkansas regulation that limited investment in real estate by a savings and loan.10  For his part in this sham deal, Mr. Ward earned over $300,000 in commissions on the sale of property.11 

<P>Prior to the discovery of the Rose Law Firm billing records in the White House Residence, the nature and extent of Mrs. Clinton's work on Castle Grande was virtually unknown.  The evidence obtained in the course of the Special Committee's investigation now establishes that Mrs. Clinton had direct and substantial involvement in Castle Grande.

<P>The Rose billing records reflect that on April 7, 1986, Mrs. Clinton had a telephone conference with Madison Guaranty's chief loan officer, Don Denton.12  The records also reflect that on May 1, 1986, Mrs. Clinton prepared an option agreement under which MFC obtained the right to buy from Mr. Ward a small piece of property called Holman Acres for $400,000.13    

<P>The background to the questionable transaction is as follows.  In spring 1986, Mr. Ward approached John Latham, the President of Madison Guaranty, about collecting his commissions from the sham sales of real estate at Castle Grande.  At the time, however, Madison Guaranty had come under scrutiny from federal banking regulators, who were examining the thrift and would have questioned the payment of such commissions.14

<P>Therefore, Seth Ward, Madison Guaranty, and Madison Financial executed a series of crossing loan transactions and promissory notes designed to pay Mr. Ward his commissions and fool the S&L's regulators.  On March 31, 1986, Madison Guaranty loaned $400,000 to Mr. Ward.15  On April 7, 1986, MFC gave two promissory notes to Mr. Ward -- one for $300,000 and the other for $70,943.16  Thus, Mr. Ward received his commissions from the $400,000 loan from Madison Guaranty, and MFC's notes effectively canceled his obligation to repay the loan and was the means by which he was able to keep his commissions. 

<P>The chief federal S&L examiner, James Clark, discovered the March 31 loan and April 7 notes during a 1986 the examination and became concerned that there might be a connection between the crossing notes.17  Specifically, he suspected that the notes might represent a payment to Mr. Ward and thus a possibly improper investment by Madison Guaranty in MFC.18  Such investments by Madison Guaranty in its service corporation, MFC, were subject to a regulation limiting Madison's ability to invest in real estate.  

<P>When Mr. Clark inquired about the March 31 and April 7 notes, however, he was told that these notes were completely unrelated.19  He was told that the April 7 notes were related to MFC's plan to purchase Holman Acres from Mr. Ward.  This transaction was to be accomplished through an as yet undrafted option agreement that would replace the notes, which existed simply to guarantee MFC's performance.20  In effect, the option agreement was a fictitious transaction designed to conceal the relationship between the March 31 loan and the April 7 notes.

<P>According to Mr. Clark, the May 1, 1986 option prepared by Mrs. Clinton was used to disguise the fact that the crossing notes between Seth Ward, MFC, and Madison Guaranty were devised to pay commissions to Mr. Ward.  In Mr. Clark's view, "the option was created 'in order to conceal the connection'" between the notes.21

<P>On April 7, 1986, Don Denton received a message that Mrs. Clinton had called.22  He returned the call and they discussed about the notes between Mr. Ward, MFC, and Madison Guaranty.23  Mr. Denton believed that Mrs. Clinton was preparing a $400,000 note between MFC and Mr. Ward, and he told her that such a note had already been prepared and executed.24  Mrs. Clinton asked him to send her whatever notes the S&L had executed with Mr. Ward.25  Mr. Denton did so, sending copies to Mrs. Clinton of the notes by courier.26

<P>Mr. Denton recalled that during this April 7 conversation he expressed concern to Mrs. Clinton with respect to the March 31 and April 1 notes because the note appeared to represent the payment by Madison Guaranty of an MFC obligation.27  Mrs. Clinton, however, "summarily dismissed" that Mr. Denton's concern in a manner that Mr. Denton took to mean that he ought to "take care of savings and loan matters, and she would take care of legal matters." 28

<P>In sum, the Special Committee concludes that Mrs. Clinton's own work product -- the May 1 option -- was used to conceal the very transactions about which Mr. Denton expressed concern.  This fact raises serious questions with respect to Mrs. Clinton's state of knowledge of the deceptive aspects of the transaction.  

<P>First, the billing records indicates that Mrs. Clinton was aware of the Arkansas regulation limiting the extent of Madison's investment in MFC.  Indeed, the records reflect that on June 17, 1985, she reviewed a memorandum prepared by a Rose associate, Richard Massey, touching upon this regulation.  More important, her conversation with Don Denton put her on notice -- prior to the drafting of the critical May 1 option -- that the notes exchanged by Mr. Ward, MFC, and Madison Guaranty were questionable.  Thus, it appears that Mrs. Clinton was apprised of both the relevant law and facts that made the Castle Grande transaction irregular.  Accordingly, an inference can be drawn that Mrs. Clinton might well have known that these documents were designed to conceal the true nature of the Madison-Ward transactions or that she consciously avoided the knowledge.  At the very least, she was on notice to inquire further. 

<P>On June 13, 1996, the same day that the Special Committee received Mr. Denton's testimony, the Committee in a letter addressed to Mr. Kendall, Mrs. Clinton's counsel, requested that the First Lady attempt to refresh her recollection regarding the matters discussed by Mr. Denton and inform the Committee of what she recalls about them.29  The Special Committee's request was made in response to an earlier offer by Mrs. Clinton through a White House spokesman to answer in writing questions regarding the subject of the Special Committee's work.

<P>On June 17, 1996 the Special Committee received an affidavit from Mrs. Clinton accompanied by a letter from Mr. Kendall.  In the affidavit, Mrs. Clinton gave no indication as to her recollection regarding the subject matter of Mr. Denton's testimony.  Instead, she simply requested that Special Committee refer to Mr. Kendall's letter "addressing certain allegations recently made by Mr. Don Denton."30  In his letter, Mr. Kendall maintained that Mr. Denton's recollection is "wholly unreliable" but gave no indication as to the recollection of the First Lady.31  In sum, the First Lady has neither confirmed nor denied Mr. Denton's testimony.

<P>Examination of Mrs. Clinton's involvement in Castle Grande cannot be viewed in isolation.  The Special Committee also takes into account Mrs. Clinton's apparent failure to be more forthcoming about her role in Mr. McDougal's Castle Grande deal.  When asked in 1995 about her knowledge of Castle Grande and some other land deals, Mrs. Clinton swore, under oath, "I do not believe I knew anything about any of these real estate parcels and projects."32  In light of the billing records, that statement appears incorrect on its face.

<P>The Rose billing records reflect that Mrs. Clinton billed almost 30 hours to Castle Grande matters during the course of her representation of Madison Guaranty -- more time than any other Rose attorney.33  And, in addition to the May 1 option and the phone call with Mr. Denton, Mrs. Clinton had 15 face-to-face or telephone conferences with Seth Ward, including one "regarding purchase from Brick Lile," the chairman of the company that sold the property to Mr. Ward and MFC.34

<P>In a sworn statement in 1996, Mrs. Clinton sought to explain her prior categorical denial of knowledge about Castle Grande by saying that she knew of the 1,000+ acre tract as "IDC" -- the name of the company that sold the property and the matter to which she charged her billings.  She further stated that she knew a small portion of the Castle Grande property, a trailer part, as Castle Grande Estates.35  The Committee finds it implausible that Mrs. Clinton would fail to recognize the name "Castle Grande" as the referring to the larger development, given the testimony of Madison Guaranty insiders and federal regulators that the entire development was commonly known as Castle Grande.36 

<P>The secreting of the Rose Law Firm billing records could have been motivated by a desire to conceal Mrs. Clinton's involvement in Castle Grande and, in particular, her involvement in work on the questionable April 7 notes and May 1 option, could have motivated the secreting of the Rose Law Firm billing records.  The jury in the recently concluded Tucker-McDougal trial convicted the defendants for crimes relating to the Castle Grande project.  Prior to the discovery of the Rose billing records, Mrs. Clinton's role in Castle Grande was unknown.  The desire to keep her role secret might have been the cause of the long absence of the billing records.

2.<P>Webster Hubbell was significantly more involved in Castle Grande than he admitted in his Senate testimony.



<P>Former Associate Attorney General and former Rose Law Firm partner Webster Hubbell has testified before the Special Committee and in other fora on several occasions.  With respect to his testimony regarding his involvement in Castle Grande, Mr. Hubbell altered his story when he learned that Seth Ward was a nominee purchaser for MFC.  In a December 1995 with the RTC, Mr. Hubbell stated that he understood as of September 1985, from Mr. Ward, that "Madison had limits on what it could own in its own name, and so Mr. Ward was going to own part of it until it could be sold."37

<P>And, in an interview with the RTC Office of Inspector General, Mr. Hubbell "said that Ward told him that he was negotiating on behalf of Madison to buy the IDC property, which would then be split up between Madison and Ward."38  In testimony before the Special Committee, however, Mr. Hubbell repeatedly testified that he was not aware of the deal between Madison and Ward until after the closing in early October 1985.39

<P>Mr. Hubbell was reluctant to answer questions regarding his own view of the legality of his father-in-law's role in the purchase of the IDC property.  When asked if Mr. McDougal used Mr. Ward to evade a regulatory restriction, Mr. Hubbell answered, "I have never represented an S&L.  I don't know whether it's illegal or not."40  When he was asked if he considered this transaction as a classic parking or warehousing transaction, Mr. Hubbell answered, "I think of parking and warehousing a little bit differently."41  When asked if he thought Mr. Ward could be considered a "straw man," Mr. Hubbell testified, "I didn't give it any consideration, you know.  'Straw man' means, to me, somebody who you clear title through."42

<P>Mr. Hubbell has denied advising Mr. Ward on the Castle Grande transaction.43  Specifically, he denied preparing a backdated September 24, 1985 letter or advising Mr. Ward on its preparation.44  There is evidence, however, that Mr. Hubbell may have prepared the backdated September 24, 1985 letter, which was found in his files at the Rose Law Firm.45  Martha Patton, Mr. Hubbell's secretary at Rose, has stated that although she does not recall typing the letter she believes that she did because the type is similar to that of the IBM typewriter that she used then, and the second page of the document is formatted in the style she used while a Rose secretary.46  She added that the letter appears to be "her style of typing."47<P>  

<P>There is also some indication that Mr. Hubbell was supposed to prepare the May 1, 1986 option agreement.  Handwritten notes taken by James Clark, the chief FHLBB examiner during the 1986 examination of Madison Guaranty, reflect the following:

<P>MFC Commitment to buy land at corner of Route 145 . . .

<P>Option will be prepared,  atty out of town (Hubbell)

<P>to replace note.48



This note strongly suggests a previously unknown involvement in Castle Grande by Mr. Hubbell.

<P>Former Madison chief loan officer Don Denton has indicated that Mr. Hubbell advised Mr. Ward on the Castle Grande matter.498

  For example, Mr. Denton believed that the wording on the note, dated October 15, 1985, stating that Mr. Ward was not personally responsible for the note was prepared by Mr. Hubbell.50  Also, Mr. Denton believed that he had some conversations with Mr. Hubbell about the February 28, 1996 transaction.51

<P>Furthermore, Mr. Denton indicated in a recent interview that Mr. Hubbell was involved in the March 31 and April 7, 1986 notes between Mr. Ward, Madison Guaranty, and Madison Financial.  He stated that he was "reasonably confident" that when Mrs. Clinton called him regarding these notes she was acting on Mr. Hubbell's behalf.52  Mr. Denton refused to say whether he ever dealt with Mr. Hubbell on the matter of the notes.53  He also declined to answer whether he had visited Mr. Hubbell's office at Rose regarding Mr. Ward or Madison Guaranty.54

<P>Mr. Hubbell may have provided inaccurate statements about his legal work on other occasions.  In 1989 when the Rose Law Firm was retained to represent the FDIC in an action against Madison Guaranty's former accountants,55 Mr. Hubbell failed to disclose to regulators Rose's prior work for Madison.  And in 1993 when he failed to disclose information he had learned the previous year from reading the Rose Law Firm billing records to FDIC investigators looking into the 1989 retention of Rose.56<P>  The Special Committee questions Mr. Hubbell's implausible claim that he did not advise Mr. Ward with respect to Castle Grande.

3.<P>In 1985, Mr. McDougal retained Hillary Clinton to represent Madison Guaranty; the work was not brought in by a young associate.

<P>The Special Committee concludes, based upon the substantial weight of the evidence, that Mr. McDougal hired Mrs. Clinton to represent Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan.  Mrs. Clinton's statements that Richard Massey, then a young Rose Law Firm associate at the time, brought the client into the firm are not supported by the documentary or testimonial evidence received by the Committee. 

<P>Mr. McDougal made statements during the 1992 Clinton presidential campaign, as well as to the Los Angeles Times in 1993, that he put Mrs. Clinton on retainer as a favor to Bill Clinton.  These McDougal statements are supported by others and by documentary evidence.  Former Madison CEO John Latham confirmed that Mr. McDougal made the decision to retain the Rose Law Firm.57  Moreover, although President Clinton does not recall asking Mr. McDougal to place Mrs. Clinton on retainer,58 Mr. McDougal performed other favors for President Clinton when he was Governor by, among other things, substantial contributions, on behalf of the Clintons, on Whitewater loans. 

<P> Mrs. Clinton's markedly different account of how the business came to the Rose Law Firm, is not confirmed by any attorney at the  Rose Law Firm, including Mr. Massey.   For example, Mrs. Clinton, has repeatedly stated that Mr. Massey, then a first year associate at the Rose Law Firm, brought in Madison Guaranty as a client.59  She claims that Mr. Latham asked Mr. Massey whether he would be interested in representing Madison in connection with a proposed stock offering.  Mrs. Clinton further explained that Mr. Massey was aware that she knew Mr. McDougal, so "he came to me and asked if I would talk with Jim to see whether or not Jim would let the lawyer and the officer go forward on this project.  I did that, and I arranged that the firm would be paid $2,000 retainer."60  

<P>Both Mr. Massey and Mr. Latham contradict Mrs. Clinton's version of events. Moreover, David Knight61, a former partner of the Rose Law Firm, testified that he was involved in this meeting between Mr. Latham and Mr. Massey, and Mr. Latham did not hire Mr. Massey.62

<P>In a statement to the FDIC OIG in November 1994, Mrs. Clinton similarly told investigators that "she recalled Massey came to her and asked her to be the billing attorney which was a normal practice when an associate was handling the matter. . . Mrs. Clinton recalled that a Madison official (individual unknown) approached Rick Massey regarding a preferred stock offering in an effort to raise capital."63  In a sworn response to an RTC interrogatory in May 1995, Mrs. Clinton elaborated on her story.  Mrs. Clinton stated that Mr. Massey approached her because "certain lawyers" in the Rose Law Firm were "opposed" to representing Mr. McDougal until Mr. McDougal paid an outstanding bill, and he was aware that Mrs. Clinton knew Mr. McDougal.  

<P>Mr. Massey, however, directly contradicted Mrs. Clinton's account stating that he was not responsible for bringing in Madison as a client.64  Specifically, Mr. Massey testified that Mr. Latham never offered him Madison's business65 and that he did not recall approaching Mrs. Clinton with a proposal to represent Madison.66  Contrary to Mrs. Clinton's unsworn statement of November 1994 to the RTC, Mr. Massey also testified that he did not ask Mrs. Clinton to be the billing attorney.67  Mr. Knight agrees that Mr. Massey did not secure an offer of business, and he -- Mr. Knight -- further testified that he would have expected to know about such an offer if it had happened.

<P>Mrs. Clinton claimed that she became involved in discussions about the Madison retainer because of an outstanding debt Mr. McDougal, through his Madison Bank & Trust, owed to the Rose Law Firm in 1985.    

<P>Documentary evidence and testimony provided to the Special Committee, however, indicated that the outstanding balance of Rose's bill to Madison Bank & Trust was paid in November 1984, months prior to Rose's retainer in April 1985.  Furthermore, Gary Bunch, President of Madison Bank & Trust provided the Special Committee with documents showing that the legal fees owed to the Rose Law Firm were paid in late October 1984.68  Mr. Bunch further testified that Mr. McDougal directed him in October 1984 to pay the outstanding Rose Law Firm bill for the Madison Bank & Trust matter in full.69

<P>Following the discovery of the Rose billing records and the testimony of Mr. Massey before the Special Committee, Mrs. Clinton's story changed in a February 1996 interview with RTC investigators.  She claimed, for the first time, that the late Vincent Foster initially informed her that Mr. Massey wanted to do legal work for Madison.70  

<P>Mrs. Clinton's statements conflict internally and with the testimony of others involved in the events surrounding Rose's Madison retainer.  Over the next several months, it was Mrs. Clinton -- not Mr. Massey -- that officials at Madison Guaranty, including Seth Ward and Jim McDougal, sought out for representation.  Finally, Mr. Massey, Mr. Knight, Mr. Latham and Mr. Bunch, all unrelated and with no apparent reason to mislead the Special Committee, contradict Mrs. Clinton's assertion that she did not bring Madison Guaranty to the Rose Law Firm as a client. 

4.<P>  Mrs. Clinton had a substantive contact with Beverly Bassett Schaffer about Madison Guaranty's proposal to issue preferred stock.



<P>The Rose billing records and Beverly Bassett Schaffer contradict Mrs. Clinton's statements that she did not speak directly to Beverly Bassett Schaffer, the Arkansas Securities Commissioner in charge of state regulation of Madison Guaranty, about Madison Guaranty's proposed preferred stock transaction.  

<P>Prior to the discovery of the billing records, Mrs. Clinton claimed in her sworn responses to RTC interrogatories in May 1995 that she called the Arkansas Securities Department to find out "to whom Mr. Massey should direct any inquiries" on the proposed stock deal, but she did not recall to whom she spoke.71

<P>The Rose billing records reflect that Mrs. Clinton called Ms. Schaffer the day before the Rose Law Firm submitted Madison's proposal to do preferred stock offering to the Arkansas Securities Department.72  In testimony before the Special Committee, Ms. Schaffer directly contradicted Mrs. Clinton and stated that the substance of the proposal was discussed during the phone call, and that Ms. Schaffer told Mrs. Clinton that her agency would approve the proposal.73 

<P>Mr. Massey likewise contradicted Mrs. Clinton's account of this important telephone call.  Mr. Massey testified that he drafted the proposal and knew exactly to whom the proposal should be sent.74  Mr. Massey also testified that Mrs. Clinton never gave any instructions to him about whom he should address the transmission letter.75

<P>This conversation has at least the appearance of an attempt by the then-Governor's wife to lobby to influence the activities of state regulators on behalf of private clients.  Thus, both Ms. Schaffer and Mrs. Clinton may have motive to hide this event from public scrutiny.  The fact that Ms. Schaffer recalls that the phone call included a discussion of the substance of Madison Guaranty's stock proposal, which she approved two weeks later, supports the Special Committee's conclusion that a substantive call occurred.  

5.<P>  Governor Clinton's official and personal dealings with James McDougal raised an apparent, if not an actual, improper conflict of interest.<P>   

<P>Governor Clinton's official and personal dealings with Jim McDougal, beyond appearances, raised an apparent, if not actual, conflict of interest.  Although Mr. McDougal was carrying the Clintons on the Whitewater loans, then Governor Clinton -- using the power of his high political office -- consistently acted favorably on Mr. McDougal's other business ventures and accepted many of the recommendations Mr. McDougal made regarding proposed state action.  These favors took the form of influence in appointments76, the awarding of lucrative state leases77, and beneficial decisions relating to state regulators.78  This favoritism was critical to Mr. McDougal, whose savings & loan was experiencing serious financial trouble. 

<P>Of course, from the standpoint of Governor Clinton, if Madison Guaranty failed or Mr. McDougal experienced financial troubles, the Clintons could be liable for the full Whitewater debt.  Thus, Governor Clinton had reason to act in a way to ensure the viability of Mr. McDougal's savings & loan, even if such action was adverse to the interests of the state.  For example, documents indicate that Governor Clinton played a role in the award of contracts for state leases to Madison.79 

<P>Perhaps the most blatant example of the problems created by this conflict of interest related to certain legislation.  In 1987, Governor Clinton vetoed a water bill that favored a utility, Castle Sewer & Water, owned by R.D. Randolph and Jim Guy Tucker, two business associates of Mr. McDougal.80  Mr. Randolph and Mr. Tucker threatened Governor Clinton by reminding him of a questionable 1985 Madison fundraiser,81 and the possibility of litigation related to Rose's representation of Madison on the utility issue.82  Shortly thereafter, Governor Clinton called the legislature into a special session and the signed the bill, as Mr. McDougal's associates desired.   

6.<P>The Clintons took an active role in obtaining and extending Whitewater-related loans; they were not "passive" investors in Whitewater.

<P>

<P>The Clintons were not "passive investors" in the Whitewater real estate venture.  Indeed, they actively sought and obtained Whitewater loans and extensions.  Based largely on Mr. Clinton's official position, state bankers routinely gave the Clintons beneficial treatment on Whitewater-related loans, often disregarding banking regulations and sound lending practices. 

<P>Whitewater was a "no cash" deal.  Mr. Clinton actively participated in obtaining the initial down payment loan the Whitewater investment.  He enlisted bank lobbyist Paul Berry to grant him and James McDougal an unsecured loan for the down payment.83  This loan was just one of the Whitewater loans that would not have been made under what the lending officer characterized as "ordinary circumstances."84<P>  

<P>Moreover, the Clintons actively participated in key meetings concerning the Whitewater real estate investment.  At the outset of the investment, Mr. Clinton met with Mr. McDougal about the structure of the financing.85  When Mr. Clinton's personal accountant, Gaines Norton, raised serious questions about the lawfulness of Mr. McDougal's plans, Mr. Clinton told him to "back off."86  This indicates a conscious avoidance of learning the facts about the Whitewater transactions.

<P>Also early in the investment, Mrs. Clinton had at least two meetings with bank officials to renew Whitewater loans.87  Although few payments of principal were being made, and the Clintons often refused to provide the required loan documents and financial statements, Mrs. Clinton's continued meetings and conversations with reluctant bank officials helped to secure the extension of Whitewater loans.88  Again and again, bankers looked the other way when the Clintons failed to make principal payments on the Whitewater loan or failed to submit the required financial statements, many times due to Governor Clinton's public office.89  Finally, after 1986, Mrs. Clinton essentially took control of the Whitewater investment.90  Mrs. Clinton sought power of attorney over the investment, paid back taxes and attempted to collect all the Whitewater documents.<P> 

<P>In fact, it appears that in many instances where the Clintons got involved with the Whitewater loans, the banking regulations were either "bent" or broken.  For example, federal and state regulators cited Mrs. Clinton's irregular out of territory and often past due loan in connection with Whitewater Lot 13 and prohibited the bank from renewing the loan.91  Governor Clinton's Bank Commissioner Marlin Jackson may have assisted the Clintons in obtaining a new loan at a bank he then regulated.92  Later, Mr. Jackson improperly used government stationary in connection with securing loan renewals for the Clintons.93  Mr. Jackson used his government position to act as a go-between for the Clintons in their dealings with a state-regulated bank was clearly inappropriate.94  This action raises serious questions of whether Mr. Jackson misused his official position to influence improperly bank action to benefit the wholly private interests of the Clintons.<P> 

7.<P>Governor Clinton's office steered state bond work to Dan Lasater. 



<P>The Special Committee was very concerned about Governor Clinton's troubling relationship with Arkansas businessman, Dan Lasater.  In 1980, Mr. Lasater entered the securities business with the firm of Collins, Locke & Lasater.  In January 1985, a Little Rock paper reported that a federal bankruptcy judge found, in open court, that Mr. Lasater lied under oath during the bankruptcy trial of his former business partner, George Locke, and also found that Mr. Lasater was involved in a conspiracy to defraud Mr. Locke's creditors.  In February 1985, widely-reported accounts of sworn testimony of federal court put Governor Clinton on notice that Mr. Lasater was a cocaine user and the subject of a drug investigation.  On October 23, 1986, Mr. Lasater was indicted on drug charges for possession and distribution of cocaine.

<P>Mr. Lasater contributed substantial sums of money to Governor Clinton,95 "loaned" $8,000 to the Governor's brother, Roger, to pay a drug debt,96 and, at the Governor's request, gave Roger a job.97

<P>The Special Committee identified three instances in which Governor Clinton or his aides inappropriately sought to take actions to intended to benefit Mr. Lasater.  First, in February 1983, Senior Economic Adviser to the Governor, Bob Nash, while acting in his official capacity, improperly directed Charles Stout, the Chairman of the Arkansas Housing Development Board ("AHDA"), to grant lucrative state bond underwriting contracts to Mr. Lasater's firm, Collins, Locke & Lasater.98  Mr. Nash directed AHDA Chairman Stout to award 15% of AHDA's bond-business to Mr. Lasater's firm.  This order represented an unprecedented interference by the Governor's office into the otherwise independent and competitive underwriting selection process of the agency99.  Mr. Nash did not suggest that the AHDA should include other Arkansas firms.  Rather, Mr. Nash's order specifically directed that Mr. Lasater's firm be included.  Mr. Nash's directive had the weight and influence of the Governor's office behind it,100 and, as a result, the AHDA Board bowed to the Governor's order awarded a substantial amount of state bond business to Mr. Lasater's firm.101  Prior to Mr. Stout's order, Mr. Lasater's firm had not received AHDA bond business.  In addition, the Stephens firm, the largest bond firm in Little Rock, questioned whether Mr. Lasater's firm was qualified to participate in these offerings.

<P>Second, in late 1983, Governor Clinton sought to use the power of his office to benefit Mr. Lasater when the Governor  personally called and asked Linda Garner, the State Insurance Commissioner, to include Collins, Locke and Lasater as a manager for the multi-billion dollar securities portfolio for which she was acting as receiver in connection with her responsibilities as Insurance Commissioner.102  Governor Clinton did not attempt to intervene on behalf of any other financial firms.103  The Committee has concluded that this contact represents another instance where Governor Clinton inappropriately tried to influence an appointed state official to direct business opportunities to Mr. Lasater.

<P>Third, the Governor's office extended itself to monitor and to facilitate Mr. Lasater's company's efforts to secure the underwriting contract for a $29 million dollar bond financing for a police radio system in 1985.104

<P>In each of these three instances, the Special Committee concludes that Mr. Lasater received inappropriate assistance from the Governor and his office.  Given Mr. Lasater's past problems, it is far from clear why Mr. Lasater would be entitled to preferential treatment.  

8.<P>The Clintons took a series of erroneous tax deductions related to Whitewater.



<P>The Special Committee concludes that the Clintons took a series of erroneous Whitewater deductions, often in error, on their personal federal income tax returns.  From 1978 to the early 1990s, the Clintons invested a total of $42,192 in Whitewater.105  During this same period, the Clintons deducted $42,656 of their Whitewater related expenses on their federal income tax returns -- almost $500 more than their total investment in the corporation.  From 1992 to this date, the Clintons have admitted taking improper deductions of $7,928 and omitting income of $8,171 on their federal income tax returns during the period of their Whitewater investment.  Based on its analysis of the available evidence, the Special Committee concludes that the Clintons could have understated their income on Whitewater-related items by as much as an additional $33,771, for a total increase in taxable income of $49,870.

<H2>SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE</H2>

PART I:  WHITEWATER DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION

<P>While running Senator Fulbright's election campaign in 1968, Jim McDougal was introduced to William Jefferson Clinton who, at the time, was a young student at Georgetown University and was working for Senator Fulbright on the staff of the Foreign Relations Committee.106  Several years later, in 1973, after Clinton had graduated from Yale Law School, he returned to Arkansas and took a university teaching position.107  In 1974, Mr. Clinton ran unsuccessfully for a congressional seat in Arkansas and, in 1976 he ran for, and won, the office of  Attorney General for Arkansas.108  During the campaign for Attorney General, Mr. Clinton re-established his relationship with Mr. McDougal, who was then a professor at Ouachita Baptist University.    

<P>During 1977, Mr. Clinton entered into his first real estate investment with Mr. McDougal.  This was a profitable investment.  Specifically, on January 25, 1977, Mr. Clinton purchased 20 acres of land from Rolling Manor, Inc., a company owned and controlled by Mr. McDougal for a price of $11,400.  In 1978, Mr. Clinton sold that land for $19,985, netting a profit of $ 8,585 in just over one year--a 75% return on his initial investment.109  This transaction convinced Mr. Clinton that investing with Mr. McDougal could bring quick profits.  At the time, Mr. Clinton, in the midst of his campaign for Attorney General, was still paying off educational loans and debt he had acquired in his congressional election loss.  Shortly afterward, Mr. Clinton was elected Attorney General.110

<P>  Near the end of Mr. Clinton's term as Attorney General, in 1978, the Clintons, impressed by their profit from Mr. Clinton's first investment with Mr. McDougal, joined Mr. McDougal in the Whitewater investment.  Mr. Clinton and Mr. McDougal borrowed $20,000 and used the money as a down payment on the purchase of 230 acres of land along the White River.111  The rest of the $203,000 purchase price was financed by another loan taken out by the Clintons and the McDougals.112  At the time of the origination of the loans, the McDougals' financial statements showed a net worth of $551,000, with total assets of $975,000.113  The Clintons, on the other hand, did not submit a financial statement, but their tax return for 1978 indicates earned income of $54,593.114

<P>The following year, on June 18, 1979, the McDougals and Clintons incorporated Whitewater Development Corporation and transferred the land that they had purchased along the White River to this company, subject to the mortgages.115  Stock in Whitewater was to be evenly distributed between the Clintons and the McDougals, but because of conflicting documentation it is difficult to determine the exact distribution of ownership.116  One thing that is certain, however, is that the Clintons and the McDougals believed they would share equally in any profits.117 

<P>Sales at the Whitewater real estate project did not meet the Clintons' and the McDougals' expectations.  Not only was there no profit, but from the early days onward, the investment did not take in enough money to service the debt.  As a result, the Clintons were forced to attend several meetings with bank officials in order to extend the loans.

<P>Between June 1979 and October 1985, the Clintons signed at least 10 renewals on various Whitewater loans at Union National Bank, Citizens Bank of Flippin, and Security Bank.  On December 16, 1980, Mrs. Clinton took out a $30,000 loan from Mr. McDougal's Madison Bank and Trust to finance the purchase of a model home for Whitewater lot 13.  It was hoped that the model home would spur lot sales.

<P>The Clintons did not put any funds into Whitewater Corporation during the period that Mr. McDougal was running Madison Guaranty.  Instead, the Clintons allowed Mr. McDougal to make the payments.  Mr. McDougal made substantial payments.  He often used funds from Madison Guaranty to service the Whitewater debt.  Whitewater did not generate sufficient cash flow because of lagging lot sales.  Thus, if Mr. McDougal was unable to cover the debt personally, the Clintons' would have been liable for the total amount of the mortgage if the bank refused to renew the notes.  Thus, the Clintons had an interest in the economic well-being of the McDougals.<P>

<P>Since questions surrounding the Clintons' investment in Whitewater first arose, the Clintons have stated they were "passive investors" in this investment.118  In May 1995, in a sworn response to interrogatories propounded by the RTC, Mrs. Clinton testified that the Clintons "the McDougals exercised control over the management and operation of WDC for the period of its existence. . . .As was contemplated from the inception of the venture, we were passive investors and relied upon the McDougals to manage and operate it."119  (emphasis added).  

<P>Since the 1992 campaign, the Clintons have continued to attempt to distance themselves from Mr. McDougal.  The Clintons have repeatedly maintained that they were passive investors in Whitewater.  Similarly, Mrs. Clinton sought to minimize the extent of her involvement in the representation of Madison Guaranty while a partner of the Rose Law Firm.   

I.<P>Whitewater: The Early Years 

<P>A.<P>The Clinton's Previously Undisclosed Land Deal with James McDougal



<P>In 1977, President Clinton made his first real estate investment with Mr. McDougal.  The Clintons' 1978 federal income tax return reported two real estate sales: a cash sale of a five-acre parcel of land purchased by the Clintons on January 25, 1977, and an installment sale of 15 acres of land also purchased that same day.120  

<P>President Clinton testified, however, that while he had no recollection of the particular investment, he recalled that he was involved in a five-acre land deal with Mr. McDougal that was sold for $5000 and resulted in a capital gain of $2150. In his May 24, 1995 sworn interrogatory responses to the RTC, President Clinton stated:

<P>I believe I made a real estate investment or investments in 1977, which are reported in our 1978 income tax return.  I can recall nothing specific about this investment or investments, except that at least one involved the purchase of land near Jacksonville. . . .  As reported in our 1978 tax return, a five acre parcel of land was sold on May 17, 1978, for $5000, resulting in a capital gain of $2150.  To the best of my recollection, this was a real estate investment I had with Jim McDougal, and, while small, it was a profitable one.  This confirmed my impression that he was capable of putting together successful real estate transactions.121

<P>This 1977 transaction was President Clinton's first real estate investment venture, and his success was a factor in his decision to purchase the real estate in Marion County, Arkansas that came to be known as Whitewater.  

<P>Documentary evidence, including the Clinton's 1978 federal income tax return, indicates that the 1977 transaction between then-Attorney General Clinton and Mr. McDougal was significantly larger, longer and more profitable than previously described by the Clintons.  According to President Clinton, a five-acre parcel purchased on January 25, 1977 was sold for $5,000 on May 17, 1978, netting the Clintons a gain of $2,150 in just under 16 months.122   The schedules to the Clintons' 1978 tax returns also report, however, an installment sale of 15 acres of unimproved land.  This 15-acre parcel was purchased on the same date as the five-acre parcel, January 25, 1977, and was sold for $14,985 on July 23, 1978, netting the Clintons a gain of $6,435 in just under 18 months.123  Thus, according to their 1978 federal income tax return, the Clintons purchased 20 acres of land on January 25, 1977, with a reported cost of $11,400 and sold all 20 acres of the land by July 23, 1978 for $19,985, netting them a profit of $8,585 -- a 75 percent return on their total investment -- in just under a year and a half.  

<P>The land was purchased from Rolling Manor Inc., a company owned by Mr. McDougal and Senator Fulbright.124  A January 25, 1977 Purchaser's Agreement between Rolling Manor Inc., the seller, and Mr. Clinton, the buyer, states that Rolling Manor Inc. agreed to sell Tract Number 74 to Mr. Clinton for $11,400.125  This $11,400 equals the adjusted cost for the 5-acre parcel ($2,850) and the 15-acre parcel ($8,550) reported on the Clintons' 1978 personal income tax return.126 The terms of the purchase agreement called for Mr. Clinton to pay $400 in cash and execute an $11,000 note to finance the balance of the purchase price.  A  January 25, 1977 installment note between Rolling Manor, Inc. and Mr. Clinton in the face amount of $11,000 was prepared by Rolling Manor, Inc.127  Mr. Clinton was obligated to pay 96 monthly installments of $155.51 beginning on April 1, 1977 at an annual percentage rate of eight percent and continuing until May 1985.1 

<P>Mr. McDougal wrote to then-Attorney General Clinton on February 4, 1977 requesting the down payment of $400 "if you have it to spare"2  and giving notice that the first monthly payment on the note was coming due on April 1, 1977.128 

<P>A First Jacksonville Bank deposit slip that was marked "paid by" Bill Clinton indicates that the $11,000 note was fully paid off by November 9, 1977 -- less than ten months after Mr. Clinton purchased the 20-acre parcel from Rolling Manor Inc. and more than eight months prior to the sale of the 15-acre parcel on July 23, 1978.129   Because the property was not sold until 1978, the source of the $9000 payment to Rolling Manor Inc. in 1977 to completely pay off the $11,0003  Rolling Manor note is not known.4<P>   In sworn testimony, Gaines Norton, the Clintons' personal accountant who prepared their 1978 tax return, admitted that "the tax return which the President makes mention of in his interrogatories . . . makes it quite clear that there was a second investment or a second part of this investment with Mr. McDougal that involved a larger piece of property and a larger profit."130  Mr. Norton also admitted that the President's answer in the interrogatory is "incomplete."131

<P>B.<P>Whitewater: A "No Cash" Deal 

<P>In 1978, the Clintons and the McDougals purchased the Whitewater land development in an entirely leveraged transaction.  The Clintons and McDougals invested no money in the original mortgage.  As a result of Mr. Clinton's political position, it appears that bank officers routinely gave preferential treatment to Whitewater loans, often violating sound banking practices concerning timely payments and proper loan documentation. 

<P>Early on, then-Attorney General Clinton was made aware of the problems with the Mr. McDougal's Whitewater tax scheme by his personal accountant, Gaines Norton.132   Mr. Clinton asked Mr. Norton to sit in on a meeting with Mr. McDougal133 to "look at an investment he was making."134  During the meeting, Mr. McDougal explained how the transaction would be arranged so that even though no money was invested in the deal -- they would use "a hundred percent borrowed money"135 -- the McDougals and the Clintons "would immediately be able to take personal tax deductions."136  

<P>Mr. Norton, a certified public accountant, immediately advised both men that the proposed tax deduction would be illegal.137  Mr. McDougal would not listen,138 however.  Curiously, after the meeting, Mr. Clinton told Mr. Norton that he "had to rely on his partner to structure [the deal] tax-wise properly" and "to back off and leave the issue alone."139

<P>Thus, against the advice of his personal accountant, the Clintons joined with the McDougals in investing in the Whitewater land venture.  The deal was financed by two banks: Citizen's Bank of Flippin ("Citizen's Bank"), a small bank located near by the Whitewater property, and Union National Bank, a larger bank in Little Rock.140  Because the Whitewater mortgage exceeded the legal lending limit of Citizen's Bank, the transaction was structured as a loan participation with the larger Little Rock Union National Bank.  Thus, Citizen's Bank and Union National Bank each financed half of the $182,611 loan that was closed on August 2, 1978.141  

<P>Frank Burge, a Vice President and loan officer at Citizen's Bank, who handled the Whitewater loan, testified that the Whitewater loan was not a typical loan for the small bank, whose portfolio was composed of residential and consumer loans.142

<P>In addition, the Clintons and McDougals never notified Citizen's Bank that Union National Bank also extended a $20,000 unsecured loan for the down payment on the Whitewater mortgage. Citizen's Bank was not aware that the Clintons and McDougals invested no money into the original mortgage.143  This loan violated Citizen's Bank's practice of not making real estate loans without an equity contribution by the borrower.144   Mr. Burge explained that "(s)ound banking tenets said you should have equity on all real estate lending."145  Similarly, Don Denton, the loan officer at Union National Bank responsible for the Whitewater loans, thought that this transaction was a potential regulatory problem.146 

<P>In fact, the Union National loan was made only as an "accommodation" to Mr. Clinton, who had actively sought to obtain it.147  According to Mr. Denton, he was instructed by a Union Bank lobbyist to make this loan -- against Mr. Denton's judgment -- to Mr. Clinton, because Mr. Clinton was an "up and coming political ... rising star in the State of Arkansas."148  Paul Berry, a Union Bank lobbyist and Mr. Clinton's former college roommate admitted that Mr. Clinton had approached him about obtaining the money for the down payment on the Whitewater deal, but claimed that he made the loan because it was "good business."149  Mr. Denton testified, however, that he would not have made the loan, given the Clintons' and the McDougals' financial condition, "had it been an arms' length loan by a client walking off the street."150  According to Mr. Burge, Mr. Clinton's political position also influenced his decision to make the loan at Citizen's Bank.151

<P>Despite the fact that Mr. McDougal and Governor Clinton ignored repeated requests for payments of principal, Union National Bank renewed the Clintons' Whitewater loan a number of times.152  Rather quickly, Citizen's Bank became concerned over the Whitewater loan.  Robert Ritter, who became the President of Citizen's Bank in September 1979, was concerned early on that the Whitewater loan would become "an item either on an examination or it became a reportable item to the Board at a particular time."153  His apprehension was compounded by problems that Citizen's Bank faced obtaining personal financial statements for the Clintons and the McDougals.154   

<P>During the early 1980s, Mr. Ritter recalled meeting twice with Mrs. Clinton and twice with Mr. Clinton.155  Mr. Ritter met once with Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. McDougal to obtain signatures on loan renewal documents.156   Mr. Ritter testified that he believes they discussed loan repayment plans.157  Mr. Ritter also recalled a second meeting5  at the bank with Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. McDougal -- probably occasioned by a loan renewal.158  He testified that Mrs. Clinton appeared knowledgeable about the Whitewater real estate development and the Whitewater loan, and, in fact, she remarked on the sharp rise in the interest rate on the loan.159  Mr. Ritter also recalled contacting Mr. Clinton twice concerning loan documentation.160  

<P>The Clintons have stated that they have no recollection of meeting with officers of Citizen's Bank to discuss their troubled Whitewater loan.161

<P>In June 1980, the Clintons were released from their personal obligation on the Union National Bank loan when Mr. McDougal retired the loan with proceeds borrowed from the Bank of Cherry Valley.162 

<P>C.<P> Lot 13: Irregularities in Madison Bank's loan to Mrs. Clinton



<P>In December 1980, the Clintons and the McDougals sought to boost lagging Whitewater lot sales by building a model home on lot 13.  Mrs. Clinton borrowed $30,000 from Madison Bank and Trust in Kingston, Arkansas ("Madison Bank"), which was controlled by Mr. McDougal, to finance the construction of the model home.163  As with the earlier loans, this loan also was obtained under unusual circumstances.

<P>Madison Bank approved the loan even though Mrs. Clinton was not a pre-existing customer, and she lived outside the bank's lending area.164  According to Mr. Bunch, the loan was underwritten in a manner that was contrary to sound banking practices: "we probably didn't have anything in the file but a signed note.  I'm sure there wasn't a financial statement.  No documentation at all."165  

<P>Although Mrs. Clinton's Madison Bank loan was scheduled to mature on December 16, 1981, the loan apparently was extended for six-months to June 1, 1982.  From the origination of the loan to its maturity, Madison Bank received only $285 in monthly interest payments.  This amount was far less than the $373 in interest owed per month.166

<P>On August 5, 1982, two months after the June extension had expired, Theresa Pockrus, executive vice-president of Madison Bank, who was responsible for monitoring delinquent loans, wrote to Mrs. Clinton notifying her of the loan's past due status, and that a "satisfactory agreement needs to be worked out."167  Ms. Pockrus was concerned about the upcoming Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") audit.168  On August 11, Mrs. Clinton told Ms. Pockrus to speak with Mr. McDougal because he would personally take care of the situation.  According to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. McDougal had been handling the payments the entire time.169  Coincidentally, after Ms. Pockrus spoke to Mr. McDougal, Madison Bank shortly thereafter received a $699 payment from an unknown payor.170 

<P>No principal payments were made, however, on the loan.171  Ms. Pockrus believed that "the loan should have been taken out of the bank all together" because it was too risky, and would have recommended that the Board "not extend it...because a $5 million bank has no business loaning money to people in Little Rock."172

<P>On April 7, 1983, Madison Bank consented to a cease and desist order with the FDIC that, among other things, restricted Madison Bank's out-of-territory lending.173  The order effectively prohibited Madison Bank from extending Mrs. Clinton's Lot 13 loan.174  In January 1983, Mr. Clinton was sworn in as the Governor of Arkansas, and, in February, he appointed Marlin Jackson, former president of Security Bank of Paragould, to be the Commissioner of the Arkansas State Bank Department ("ASBD").175  

<P>On June 27, 1983, the ASBD released the results of its examination of Madison Bank, identifying Mrs. Clinton's loan as a problem.176  The ASBD later joined the FDIC in ordering Madison Bank to close out its out-of-territory loans.177  Thus, Madison Bank was forced to remove Mrs. Clinton's out-of-territory loan from its portfolio.178  Afterward, Mr. Jackson saw Governor Clinton in the State Capitol and told him about Madison Bank's  deteriorating condition.179  Mr. Jackson did not normally advise the Governor of the results of bank examinations.180

<P>Meanwhile, the Whitewater debt remained outstanding and sales were slow.  Mr. Jackson admitted that he directed Governor Clinton to seek a loan with Security Bank of Paragould ("Security Bank").181  Indeed, on September 30, 1983, Governor Clinton obtained an unsecured $20,800 loan from Security Bank and used the proceeds to pay off Mrs. Clinton's Madison Bank loan.6 

<P>When Mrs. Clinton asked for a loan extension, Security Bank offered a one-year extension to September 30, 1985.182  On October 11, 1985, after Mrs. Clinton failed to meet her payments, Security Bank extended the note again to September 30, 1986.183<P>  On November 1, 1985, Mr. Jackson wrote to Charles Campbell, vice-president of Security Bank, on the official letterhead of the State Banking Commissioner, enclosing the extension agreement.184  When asked about the propriety of Mr. Jackson's communicating to a bank on official stationary about the Governor's loan, William Lyon, a friend of Mr. Jackson's, a bank owner, and former member of the ASBD testified: "[i]t was not right for him to do that.  He should never have done this."185

<P>On November 20, 1986, Security Bank again sent Mrs. Clinton a notice that payment was past due on the loan, now in the amount of $15,435.51.186  On March 2, 1987, Mr. Jackson telephoned Mrs. Clinton to give her William Fisher's telephone number.187  Three days later, Mr. Fisher, the president of Security Bank, sent a new note to Mrs. Clinton for $14,117.59, due on March 5, 1988, and requested financial statements.188  On March 31, Mr. Jackson sent another letter to Mrs. Clinton, enclosing the extension agreement and telling her not to hesitate to contact Mr. Fisher.189  

<P>The Special Committee finds that it was clearly inappropriate for someone in Mr. Jackson's position to act as a go-between for the Clintons in their dealings with Security Bank, and, Mr. Jackson's involvement, at the very least, raises questions of whether improper influence was used to benefit the Clintons.  The letters sent and received by Mr. Jackson reveal a continuing pattern of activity by him on behalf of the Clintons while he was a Clinton-appointed state employee (who happened to own controlling interest in a bank that he was charged with regulating which, coincidentally, took over a loan that had been a problem for the Clintons).  

<P>Governor Clinton's loan at Security Bank of Paragould was frequently delinquent, and the bank constantly sought to either collect or extend the loan.  The loan officers experienced some difficulty in obtaining documents needed from the Clintons to complete the extension agreements.  

II.<P>The Clintons' Continued Involvement in Whitewater: 1987 - 1992



<P>A.<P>The Clintons' Active Involvement in the Management of Whitewater After 1986



<P>By early 1982, both the Governor and Mrs. Clinton had attended meetings with bankers on the Whitewater loan renewals. Therefore, the Clintons should have been aware that the cash flow from Whitewater was not covering the debt, and that lot sales were not going well (hence, the need for the December 1980 lot 13 prefab home in Mrs. Clinton's name to try to attract purchasers).190 

<P>Indeed, by May 1985, only 20 of the Whitewater 44 lots were under contract for deed.191  Whitewater realtor Christopher Wade and Dr. E. Russell Webb, through Ozark Air Services, Inc. ("Ozark Air"), acquired the remaining twenty-four lots in Whitewater.192  In exchange for the twenty-four lots, Ozark Air agreed to repay $35,000 of the remaining Whitewater loan to 1st Ozark (the Clintons and McDougals remained personally obligated on the note),193 and transferred title to a 1979 Piper Seminole airplane to James McDougal.194  Mrs. Clinton admitted in RTC interrogatories that McDougal informed her in 1986 that the remaining Whitewater lots had been sold to Chris Wade in 1985.195   

<P>Between 1982 and 1986, while Mr. McDougal was running Madison Guaranty, the Clintons made no cash payments toward the Whitewater loans.196  After Mr. McDougal was removed from Madison Guaranty in July 1986, Mrs. Clinton took a more active role in Whitewater.  

<P>Wesley Strange, who became President of 1st Ozark National Bank in 1986, testified that Mrs. Clinton, rather than Susan or James McDougal, was his primary contact person on the Whitewater loan,197 beginning sometime in the fall of 1986.198   Thereafter, Mr. Strange and Mrs. Clinton had numerous contacts relating to taxable income from Whitewater, loan documentation and the corporate records of Whitewater.199  

<P>Yet, the Clintons continued their pattern of failing to provide requested financial statements.  Obtaining relevant information for the credit file, particularly financial statements, regarding the Clintons and McDougals was a recurring problem for Citizen's Bank and its successor, 1st Ozark National Bank.200   1st Ozark loan officers hesitated, however, to press the Clintons for missing or delinquent information and "walked softly" with regard to this loan so as not to irritate Governor Clinton or the board of directors at the bank.201

<P>By 1987, 1st Ozark loan officers Ronald Proctor and Vernon Dewey both realized that the bank should not renew the Clintons' original Whitewater mortgage without first receiving current financial statements for the Clintons and establishing an escrow account to reduce the principal balance of the loan.202   Nevertheless, the bank continued to exercise forbearance, granting waivers on the provision of financial information to both the Clintons and the McDougals.  The bank also failed to undertake minimal efforts to ensure that the Clintons and the McDougals had sufficient collateral for the loan; for instance, there was no evidence of an appraisal or inspection of the Whitewater property (the primary source of collateral for the bank) between the summer of 1978 and December 1986.203

<P>On November 28, 1988, Mrs. Clinton wrote to Mr. McDougal seeking power of attorney for matters concerning the Whitewater investment.  The letter said: "I am enclosing a Power of Attorney for you to sign, authorizing me to act on your behalf with respect to matters concerning Whitewater Development Corp."  Mrs. Clinton's letter also indicated that the Clintons at the time were actively involved in attempts to dispose of the remaining Whitewater property:  "We are trying to sell off the property that is left and get out from under the obligations at both Flippin and Paragould."204  

<P>On June 21, 1990, Mrs. Clinton signed the legal forms indicating that, as of December 31, 1987, and December 31, 1988, she was the President of Whitewater Development Corp.205  

<P>B.<P>Governor Clinton's Approval of Special Legislation Benefitting his Whitewater Banker 



<P>On February 15, 1984, Citizen's Bank, which continued to hold the original Whitewater mortgage, was sold to TC Bancshares.206  This acquisition was significant for several reasons.  First, on January 1, 1986, Citizen's Bank's charter was converted into a national bank chartered and subject to examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC") and became known as 1st Ozark National Bank.207  This conversion significantly changed the regulatory environment for the bank holding the Whitewater mortgage.  OCC examinations were precise and demanding; loan management and credit file maintenance were subject to greater scrutiny.208    

<P>Second, TC Bancshares' flagship bank was Twin City Bank ("TCB") of North Little Rock, one of the largest state-chartered banks in Arkansas.209  TCB's President, Edward Penick, and its Chairman, Terry Renaud, became members of 1st Ozark's board of directors,210 and Susan Sisk, a senior lending officer at TCB, was assigned to review the decisions of the 1st Ozark officer's loan committee and, because of the loan committee's requirement for unanimous action, could exercise virtual veto power.211  

<P>In the mid-1980's, TCB sought to amend Arkansas' restrictive bank branching laws.212   TCB's growth was limited because of the restrictions that Arkansas law placed on branching; TCB, which was headquartered in North Little Rock, could not branch into Little Rock.  As early as May 26, 1986, Mr. Penick began to look for solutions to this problem.  After meeting with State Banking Commissioner Marlin Jackson, it became apparent to Mr. Penick that TCB's desire for expanded branching powers could not be realized without legislation.213  During the 1987 Arkansas Legislative session, legislation was introduced that would permit TCB to enter the lucrative Little Rock market.

<P>On April 1, 1987, this legislation, Act 539, was approved.214  Act 539 amended Arkansas bank branching law to allow banks located in counties with populations of greater than 200,000 people to branch anywhere in that county.  Because Pulaski County (which includes Little Rock and North Little Rock) was the only county in Arkansas with a population over 200,000, this law implicated the Arkansas Constitution's prohibition against local legislation.215

<P>Act 539 was passed without widespread support from the Arkansas banking industry.  Mr. Penick recalled that a majority of the state's banks opposed this bill, and that both Arkansas Bankers Association and Independent Bankers Association opposed this legislation.216  Nevertheless, Act 539 did enjoy support from two major banks with connections to the financing of Whitewater  -- TCB and Union National Bank (the bank that loaned the Clintons and McDougals the down payment for Whitewater, and financed half of the mortgage loan for the Whitewater property).  Mr. Penick testified that he was "proactive" in his lobbying on behalf of Act 539.217  Mr. Penick worked closely with Paul Berry -- Governor Clinton's former roommate who had helped secure the Whitewater down payment loan -- on passage of this bill.  Mr. Berry admitted that he contacted Governor Clinton to encourage him not to veto this legislation.218  

<P>This same time period -- from the middle of 1986 through the spring of 1987 -- was an important time for Whitewater Development Corp.  The Dallas Federal Home Loan Bank had forced James McDougal out of Madison in July 1986219, and Whitewater Development Corp. had accrued $90,000 in unrecoverable losses.  In a November 14, 1986 letter, Mr. McDougal apprised the Clintons of these losses and cash flow problems.  In this letter, Mr. McDougal suggested that the Clintons transfer their Whitewater shares to him, and that he would assume the losses.220   The Clintons refused the offer, and the Whitewater loan at 1st Ozark matured on December 3, 1986.221 

<P>Thus, in December 1986, in light of past criticism from federal regulators about the quality of loan documentation, Ronald Proctor, the 1st Ozark lending officer primarily responsible for the Whitewater loan, drove to the Whitewater property to conduct an inspection.  Mr. Proctor testified that collateral inspections were "very common" when a real estate development loan came up for renewal.222  Mr. Proctor's supervisor, Mr. Strange, agreed, testifying that such inspections would have been "prudent."223  Nevertheless, this was the first time that Mr. Proctor inspected the property.224   In fact, there is no evidence in the Whitewater credit file of any other independent appraisal of the property between 1978 and December 1986, and Mr. Proctor's 1984 work sheet employs the $1,100 per acre value from the 1978 appraisal.225 

<P>Mr. Proctor's inspection showed that the value of Whitewater had declined precipitously, from $1,100 per acre to no more than $750 per acre.226  Thus, since the Whitewater loan had two primary sources of security -- the property that collateralized the loan, and the guarantees of the Clintons and McDougals -- the value of the guarantees of the Clintons and McDougals was now of greater importance to 1st Ozark in considering whether to renew the loan.  In order to make a decision on loan renewal, financial statements are necessary; indeed, sound banking policy dictates annual submission of updated financial statements to ensure a borrower's financial condition is not deteriorating.227  

Nevertheless, 1st Ozark did not possess current financial statements for the Clintons.  Because there was real concern about renewing the Whitewater loan without receiving current financial statements, 1st Ozark conditioned the loan extension on, among other things, the provision of financial statements by the Clintons and McDougals.228  Vernon Dewey believed that 1st Ozark should have required repayment of the loan and shared his concern with Ron Proctor.  Nevertheless, Mr. Dewey voted to approve the renewal because it was for the Governor.229 

<P>Despite the fact that the Whitewater loan's renewal was conditioned on the provision of financial statements, 1st Ozark once again experienced difficulty obtaining them.  Mr. Strange, 1st Ozark's president, mentioned this problem to Governor Clinton but still no financial statements were forthcoming.230   At some point in early 1987, the absence of financial statements for the Clintons was brought to the attention of 1st Ozark's chairman, and TCB's president, Mr. Penick.  Mr. Penick agreed to help in securing the necessary financial information from the Clintons.231  Mr. Penick decided to take steps to obtain the financial information from the Clintons.  He testified that he mailed the to Mrs. Clinton Twin City Bank financial statement form, although no such correspondence was produced to the Special Committee.232

<P>Ronald Proctor and Vernon Dewey, who were both members of the loan committee that required the financial statement as a condition for renewal, recalled that Mr. Penick offered to have Margaret Davenport, who was a friend of Mrs. Clinton's, contact Ms. Clinton to obtain the financial statement.233  Mr. Penick claimed he did not recall soliciting Ms. Davenport's assistance to obtain the financial statement.234

<P>Mrs. Clinton' handwritten notes indicate, however, that she discussed the Whitewater loan with Ms. Davenport in 1987.  The information regarding the status of the loan makes it clear that the notes relate to the 1987 extension. 235  Ms. (Davenport) Eldridge claimed that she did not recall this conversation, even after reviewing these notes.236  1st Ozark finally obtained the Clinton's financial statement237, on a TCB form, and the Clinton's guaranty agreement, both dated March 26, 1987.238<P>   Curiously, four days after the loan was renewed, Governor Clinton signed Act 539 into law.

<P>The next year, banking legislation affecting TCB came before the Arkansas legislature.  Although the Legislature was not scheduled to meet in 1988, the Banking industry was pressing for a special session to consider an "omnibus banking bill."  The catalyst for this push was the United States Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit's decision in Department of Banking v. Clarke.  In effect, the Clarke decision authorized Mississippi national banks to branch based on the more liberal branching laws that applied to Mississippi savings associations (rather than the branching laws that applied to Mississippi-chartered commercial banks).239  The Arkansas banking industry was concerned that the OCC would employ the Clarke decision to grant national banks expansive branching powers, and thereby give national banks in Arkansas a competitive advantage over state banks.240

<P>Governor Clinton was not eager to call a special session; both his Chief of Staff, Betsey Wright and a close associate, Bruce Lindsey advised against it.241  Governor Clinton and his staff were apprised that TCB was among a small group of banks that opposed the special session and the omnibus banking bill.242   TCB's concern was that the 1988 bill might be used to close the loophole that Act 539 had created in the so-called "300 feet rule."  Act 539 had removed restrictions on branching in Pulaski County, including a restriction on opening a branch within 300 feet of another bank.  This provision allowed TCB to open a branch in downtown Little Rock, within 300 feet of the offices of First Commercial Bank.243  First Commercial had sought an Attorney General's opinion regarding Act 539's constitutionality and had initiated a lawsuit, claiming that Act 539 was unconstitutional local legislation.244  The Governor's office was apprised of both these actions.245 

<P>In early 1988, draft legislation was circulated and Hartsfield and the Arkansas Bankers Association began working on building support for the special session.246  TCB's concern that the 1988 bill might be used to reimpose the 300 foot rule on TCB was well-founded.  While the initial draft of this legislation probably did not contain language closing this loophole, Bill Bowen of First Commercial continued his efforts to close the loophole.247   At some point in the process, he was able to obtain language in draft legislation to close the loophole.  TCB maintained its opposition to the special session throughout spring 1988.   Mr. Bowen told the Governor's assistant, Samuel Bratton, that TCB was "attempting `to be a spoiler'."248  Clearly, there was a conflict between TCB and First Commercial with respect to the 300 feet rule, or, more aptly, the presence of TCB's downtown Little Rock branch.

<P>While the disputes regarding the Special Session ensued, the Whitewater loan was coming up for renewal.  Under the March 1987 extension, the loan matured on April 3, 1988.249   In February 1988, Mr. Proctor began to seek financial statements needed for the renewal from the Clintons and McDougals.  During telephone conversation with Mrs. McDougal, Mr. Proctor "implied" that the loan would not be renewed without updated  financials.250  A loan extension agreement was prepared for signature on April 3, 1988, but was not signed.  Apparently, the McDougals, who were the officers of Whitewater Development Corp. and the only persons authorized to sign the renewal documents, could not be located to sign them.  1st Ozark enlisted Mrs. Clinton in an attempt to locate the McDougals and to obtain the necessary signatures for renewing the loan.251 

<P>On July 3, 1988 Governor Clinton called a special session of the Arkansas Legislature to consider the banking bill.252   The TCB/First Commercial conflict over the 300 feet issue remained unresolved; however, documentary evidence in the Committee's possession indicates that this issue was shortly resolved when Governor Clinton intervened on TCB's behalf.  There are notes of a July 5, 1988 meeting (that appear to be in Mr. Bratton's handwriting) regarding revisions to the Banking Bill.  These notes includes the following notation:  "p 16 - `300 feet' provision -- BC will call Bowen."253   That same day, Betsey Wright sent a memorandum to Governor Clinton and Mr. Bratton regarding the "300 foot" issue.  Suggesting that the Governor had intervened, Wright wrote that:

<P> "(n)either Sam nor I understands what your next step/followup with Bill Bowen is on the 300' issue.  The bill which is being delivered to this office in the morning by the Bankers Association/Bill Ford does not contain the 300' provision based on their conversation with you this morning."254 

A July 5th draft delivered to the Governor's office contains the same "grandfather clause" that Ed Penick had suggested to Marlin Jackson in a May 23, 1988 letter.255  Also on July 5, 1988, Mr. Penick sent a note to "Bill" thanking him for his assistance on the 300 feet provision.256   When questioned regarding this note, Mr. Penick suggested that it was not a note to Governor Clinton, but rather Banking Commissioner Bill Ford.  The available documentary evidence undermines Mr. Penick's recollection.  First, this handwritten note was discovered among the Governor's papers.  The Banking Department's records were subpoenaed and this note was not produced (despite the fact that Bill Ford is still Commissioner).  Second, this note contains the notation "GOV," as well as the check mark that Governor Clinton frequently used to indicate that he had reviewed an item.  Mr.  Penick testified that he was more likely to address Governor Clinton as "Governor" than "Bill."257   Mr. Penick's recollection on this count also is called into question by the documentary evidence; notably, the Committee obtained a June 6, 1988 note from Mr. Penick to Governor Clinton in which the salutation is also to "Bill."258

<P>On July 7, 1988, Bill Bowen responded to Governor Clinton's proposal to remove "300 feet language" from the proposed bill.  While Mr. Bowen committed himself to support the total package, he indicated in his letter that the package as proposed (including the 300 feet provision) enjoyed the support of 80% of bank CEO's in attendance at a March 1988 industry meeting, and that the "300-feet" specific provision enjoyed overwhelming support among the leadership of the Arkansas Bankers Association.259

<P>Nevertheless, TCB carried the day.  On July 15, 1988, the banking bill became law.  As enacted, the bill did not contain Mr. Penick's suggested grandfather provision, but it did contain language that protected TCB's presence in Little Rock's downtown business area.260 

<P>Again curiously, that same day, the Clintons received a loan extension from 1st Ozark for their Whitewater loan for three years, through November 3, 1991.  This renewal occurred three months after the loan term had matured.261 Mrs. Clinton, who had been unable to contact either of the McDougals, signed for Whitewater Development Corp.  1st Ozark waived the financial statement requirement for both the McDougals and the Clintons.  The waiver for the Clintons would appear to be unusual -- with the McDougals out of the picture, the Clintons were the sole guarantors of the loan's repayment.  

<P>Granting this waiver to the McDougals and Clintons represented a change in policy for 1st Ozark.  Mr. Proctor, who wrote to Mrs. McDougal for financial statements in February 1988 (nearly two months before the loan came due), was unable to explain why this same information was not necessary in July 1988.262

III.<P>The Clintons' Handling of Whitewater During the 1992 Presidential Campaign



<P>A.<P>The Focus on Whitewater During the 1992 Campaign 

<P>During the 1992 presidential campaign, questions arose about Whitewater, Madison, and the Clintons' relationship with the McDougals.  On March 8, 1992, the front page of the New York Times carried the headline: "Clintons Joined S&L Operator In An Ozark Real-Estate Venture."  The article, written by Jeff Gerth, reported the ties between the Clintons and the McDougals, focusing attention on their investment in Whitewater and the questionable tax deductions taken by the Clintons in 1984 and 1985.  The Times report suggested that Whitewater may have been used as a conduit to funnel money to the Clintons or to Bill Clinton's political campaigns.263

<P>In anticipation of the Gerth article and in response to the subsequent media interest in the story, the Clinton campaign organized a team of senior advisors to gather facts about from other candidates.  Susan Thomases, the New York lawyer and confidant of Mrs. Clinton, involved in matters surrounding the handling of documents in Vincent Foster's office following his death, and Loretta Lynch, a campaign official, reconstructed Whitewater-related records and coordinated the response effort.264  Webster Hubbell and Vincent Foster, both then partners at the Rose Law Firm, were responsible for collecting materials from Rose relating to Mrs. Clinton's work for Mr. McDougal and his S&L.265

<P>The campaign's effort to contact the McDougal and other principals associated with Whitewater-related transaction was headed by James Blair, General Counsel of Tyson Foods, and a close friend of the Clintons.  Mr. Blair had also known Mr. McDougal for over 30 years.266  After Whitewater surfaced in the campaign, Mr. Blair contacted Mr. McDougal's lawyer, Sam Heuer, and arranged a meeting for Mr. Blair, Ms. Lynch, Mr. McDougal, and Mr. Heuer.267

<P>Several days after the first New York Times article was published, on March 11, Mr. Blair and Ms. Lynch went to Mr. Heuer's office.268  When they arrived, Mr. Heuer met the pair outside and escorted them upstairs into his office.269  After some pleasantries, Mr. Blair asked Mr. McDougal why he talked to Mr. Gerth from the New York Times."270  Mr. McDougal replied that, based on his experience an assistant to former Senator Fulbright, "when the press had something it was better to talk and simply give it all to them."271

<P>When Mr. Blair asked whether Mr. McDougal would stop talking to the press, Mr. McDougal stated that he would "but indicated he didn't want to be bashed in the press."272

<P>Mr. Blair then travelled to Flippin to interview Christopher Wade, the Whitewater real estate agent, and to obtain some records.  It is not clear exactly what documents Mr. Blair collected from the Wades or whether Mr. Blair took notes of his conversations with Mr. Wade.  The campaign file containing the notation -- "WWDC Jim Blair Flippin Trip"273 -- was empty.274  When asked about his interview of Mr. Wade, Blair testified that he discussed the fact that Mr. Wade had not discharged his obligation on the $35,000.275

<P>Mr. Blair also accused Mr. Wade of taking advantage of Mr. McDougal's situation in the 1985 transfer of the 24 Whitewater lots,276 and Mr. Blair questioned Mr. Wade about why he had not paid off the Whitewater mortgage.  On May 11, 1992, shortly after the visit from Mr. Blair, Ozark Air obtained a loan from River Valley Bank & Trust ("River Valley"), formerly Citizens Bank of Lavaca, for $10,500.277  As collateral for this loan, Ozark Air relied on the escrow contracts on lots 2, 9, 23, 30, 37, 43, and 44 of Whitewater Estates.278  On May 12, 1992, Ozark Air wrote a check to 1st Ozark for $9,628.67 to close out the remaining Whitewater mortgage.279  

<P>By paying off the Whitewater loan with another bank loan, Mr. Wade merely exchanged one liability (his contractual obligation to assume $35,000 of the outstanding debt on the mortgage) for another (his obligation to River Valley Bank to repay a loan that was secured by the same collateral securing the Whitewater mortgage loan).  However, this transaction accomplished one significant goal -- it released the Clintons, who were guarantors of the Whitewater loan, from personal liability.280   Mr. Wade asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, so the Committee was unable to examine him regarding this loan.281  

<P>Mr. Wade obtained the loan that he used to pay-off the Whitewater loan through former Citizen's Bank President James Patterson who was then the President of River Valley.282  After Mr. Wade called Mr. Patterson, he was granted this loan over the phone.283   Mr. Patterson, who admitted he did not even like Mr. Wade284, claimed that he did not recall the purpose of the loan or whether the bank received collateral.285  Mr. Patterson admitted that the loan to Mr. Wade was outside of River Valley's lending territory.286   

<P>It is unclear why Mr. Patterson would make this loan to Mr. Wade when Mr. Wade was in bankruptcy.7   Mr. Patterson initially testified that Wade had emerged from bankruptcy by the time this loan was made.287   When asked whether he understood that a person in bankruptcy is not supposed to engage in financial transactions without court supervision, Patterson claimed that he "didn't understand that if somebody had filed bankruptcy that they couldn't go make a new deal."288  In fact, Mr. Patterson continued to assert that he made this loan to Mr. Wade, a man who was in involuntary bankruptcy, because "(h)e was worth the loan."289

<P>B.<P>The Lyons Report

<P>In February or early March 1992, James Lyons, a senior partner at the Denver, Colorado law firm of Rothgerber, Appel, Powers & Johnson, was asked by the Clinton campaign to investigate the Clintons' investment in Whitewater.290  Mr. Lyons specialized in complex civil litigation.291  He was also a friend and political supporter of the Clintons since the late 1970s292 and was the ad hoc chair of a group of lawyers from around the country who provided support and volunteer legal advice and services to the Clinton campaign.293

<P>Mr. Lyons reviewed the available Whitewater "documents and information...that had been assembled by campaign staff after the issue had been raised by Mr. Jeff Gerth of the New York Times."294  Based on his preliminary analysis of the documents, Mr. Lyons determined that the campaign "needed accounting help to assist in a financial reconstruction."  He "made a recommendation to campaign staff and to Governor and Mrs. Clinton . . . to engage Patten, McCarthy & Associates,"295 a Denver financial consulting firm.

<P>In early March 1992, Mr. Lyons contacted Leslie Patten, a certified public accountant and president of Patten, McCarthy & Associates,296 and engaged his firm, on behalf of the Clintons, to conduct "a financial reconstruction of Whitewater Development Corporation from the then available books and records."297  Mr. Lyons and Mr. Patten were "friends" and "had a professional relationship for a number of years."298  Mr. Patten's firm provided "consultation on banking, financial, accounting and tax matters arising from business litigation and expert witness testimony on such issues."299  On March 10, 1992 the Patten firm began working on its analysis of Whitewater.300  Mr. Patten and Norris Weese, another certified public accountant and the firm's vice president, were the only professionals who performed work on the document that became the final report.301  Mr. Weese went to Arkansas to gather documents and began the financial analyses, and Mr. Patten reviewed the financial analyses and drafted the document that became the final report.302 

<P>Work on the so-called Lyons report proceeded rapidly, with the involvement of Mrs. Clinton.  On March 18, 1992, just eight days after the Mr. Patten and Mr. Weese began work on the project, a draft of the final report was completed,303 and was faxed the next day to Mr. Lyons, Mrs. Clinton, Loretta Lynch and James Hamilton, a lawyer working with Mr. Lyons on the Clinton campaign.304  The fax to Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Lynch was 55 pages long and contained over 30 pages of work papers prepared by the Patten firm.  On March 20, a revised draft was faxed to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Hamilton, and John Klusaritz, another Clinton campaign lawyer.305  Later that day, Mr. Patten faxed to Mrs Clinton a revised report, dated March 20, 1992 and addressed to Governor Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, that contained six type-written pages.  The report was signed by Mr. Patten and Mr. Weese.306  According to Mr. Patten, "the substance of the report was pretty much final at that point," but "I think we were premature in signing it because we had not obtained everybody's comments."307  During this period, Mr. Patten testified that he "was in fairly regular communication with Mr. Lyons," who "was anxious to get this project completed and was seeking periodic updates as to where we were in the process."308

<P>Then, on March 20 or March 21, 1992, Mr. Lyons contacted Mr. Patten and told him that he wanted two versions of the report prepared, a summary version that only addressed specific questions raised by the press and a full report addressed to him.  According to Mr. Patten's testimony:

<P>It's at this approximate point [in] time when Mr. Lyons advised me that he wanted a summary report prepared. . . .  The essence of it was that Mr. Lyons indicated that he [would] like to have a summary report in addition to the full report which would be addressed to him. . . .  My understanding was that the purpose of the summary report was to address two or three specific questions that had been raised by the press.309  

<P>Mr. Lyons testified that the Patten firm "prepared a single report and a summary of it"310 and that "[o]ne is simply shorter and in my opinion was more responsive to the issues that were then being put forward by the press."311  On March 21, 1992, Mr. Patten faxed a shorter version of the report to Mrs Clinton.312  As with the version of the report faxed to Mrs. Clinton the day before, this version of the report, dated March 21, 1992, was addressed to the Clintons and was signed by Mr. Patten and Mr. Weese, but it was almost three pages shorter than the previous day's version.313  On March 22, 1992, Mr. Patten faxed even shorter versions of the report, dated March 23, 1992 and signed by Mr. Weese and Mr. Patten, to Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Lynch.314  

<P>On March 23, 1992, Mr. Patten faxed Mrs. Clinton the final summary version of the Patten firm's report, which contained three type-written pages and two pages of charts.315 A one page cover letter from Mr. Patten to the Clintons states: "Pursuant to the request of James Lyons, Esq., enclosed please find Patten McCarthy & Associates, Inc's report pursuant to our recent engagement."

<P>In a March 23, 1992 letter to the Clintons, Mr. Lyons notified the Clintons that his review of Whitewater had been completed.  He noted the findings of the summary report, including that the Clintons' had "invested approximately $70,000 in the corporation."316  The Clinton campaign only released the final summary version of the Patten firm's report to the press,317 and Mr. Patten testified that Mr. Lyons "is the only individual that received both versions of the report."318

<P>On April 10, 1992, Mr. Lyons sent the Clintons the final complete version319 of the Patten firm's report, which contained seven type-written pages and three pages of charts.320  In his cover letter, Mr. Lyons states:

<P>Enclosed please find the complete report prepared by Patten, McCarthy & Associates concerning Whitewater Development.  A summary of this report was previously sent to you and released to the press along with a cover letter from me on March 23, 1992.  I have deferred sending this complete report until now to avoid any confusion or possible inadvertent production.  The only copies of this report which exist (other than the enclosed original) are in my file and the confidential files of Les Patten.321



<P>He then explained that the summary report omitted several items:



<P>Please note the enclosed report discusses such things as the $9,000 interest deduction taken by you in 1980, lot 13 and borrowings associated with it, and the sale of 24 lots in 1985 to Ozark Air for assumption of the mortgage and an airplane.  None of these items is set out in the summary report which was released to the press.  Similarly, the summary report released to the press did not contain Schedule 1, which details loans and advances by the McDougals and the Clintons from 1980- 1991.322



<P>Mr. Lyons concluded his letter by noting: "Accordingly, it is my recommendation to you that you maintain the complete report in strictest confidence and do not waive either the attorney/client or accountant/client privilege which attaches to the enclosed report."(emphasis added)323

<P>Mr. Lindsey testified that the complete report was not released to the press as of late 1993.324 According to his testimony, "it turned out later [after late 1993] at least one reporter, through other sources, probably Independent Counsel, who knows, reported on the longer version of the Lyons report, but at that time I don't think anyone had reported on it."325

<P>In March 1994, almost two years to the date after the Patten firm issued its report, it was discovered that the report had overstated the Clintons investment in Whitewater by $22,244.65.326  The $68,900 investment in Whitewater by the Clintons reported by the Patten firm included a check paid by Mr. Clinton to Madison Bank and Trust in 1982 on a loan used to purchase a house for his mother in Hot Springs, Arkansas.327  Thus, the Patten firm overstated the Clinton's Whitewater investment by more than 30 percent.

<P>Less than two weeks after this error was first acknowledged, Mr. Patten, in a November 4, 1993 memorandum to Mr. Lyons, explained the problems that his firm had encountered in its analysis.  Mr. Patten noted that his firm's work "did not and could not constitute an audit, review, compilation or the application of agreed upon procedures as those terms are understood within the accounting profession."  He further wrote that "source documentation was not available in many instances and we had to utilize the next best available documentation," and that "[t]he financial statements that we reconstructed took into consideration monies paid by the Clintons, the McDougals and others that had not been reflected in the accountant's workpapers or tax returns."328

<P>C.<P>The Clintons Finally Get Out of Whitewater 

<P>Among the documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death was his handwritten note: "Get out of White Water."329  To that end, Mr. Foster, Mr. Hubbell and others in the Clinton organization met with Mr. Lyons on November 24, 1992, two weeks after Mr. Clinton was elected President.330

<P>Mr. Blair called Mr. McDougal's attorney, Sam Heuer, and told him that "the Clintons and the McDougals needed to be totally separated over the Whitewater thing."331  According to Mr. Blair, he suggested that Mr. McDougal pay a nominal amount to buy the Clintons' interest in Whitewater:332  "I think we settled on a thousand dollars as an appropriate nominal amount."333  There was one problem: "McDougal doesn't have a thousand dollars."334  Mr. Blair then told Mr. Heuer, "[W]ell, what the heck, I will loan him the thousand dollars.  I'll just Fed Ex you a check to your trust account.  And I believe that's what I did."335  The loan was made without interest,336 and Mr. McDougal has never repaid Mr. Blair.337  

<P>On December 22, 1993, Mr. McDougal and the Clintons executed the transaction to get the Clintons out of Whitewater.338  Mr. Foster obtained the Clintons' signature for the documents executing the sale.339  It is unclear whether Mr. Foster, Mr. McDougal, or the Clintons knew that Mr. Blair gave Mr. McDougal the $1000 to buy the Whitewater shares from the Clintons.340

<P>Mr. Blair then assigned Mr. Foster the task of contacting the accountants and preparing the Clintons' tax returns.341  The issue facing Mr. Foster in the months preceding his death was how to treat the $1000 sale on the Clintons' 1992 tax returns.  The basic dilemma stemmed from the Clintons' claim, bolstered by the publicly released Lyons report, that they had incurred significant losses on their investment in Whitewater.  The problem with declaring the loss on the Clintons's tax return was the lack of a proper basis with which to calculate the cost of the venture to the Clintons.  Despite their claim that they were 50% partners in the venture, the Clintons had contributed less than 25% of the funds used to cover Whitewater's losses.

<P>Also among the documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of death were his notes of conversations with the Clintons' accountant, Yoly Redden.342  The notes, in Mr. Foster's hand, identified the tax problem as a "can of worms you shouldn't open."343  His notes in the file outlined the basic tax issues the Clintons faced in connection with Whitewater:

<P>"1)<P>What was nature of deductions

<P><P>A.  How deduct interest/principal payments for corp.?



<P>2)<P>Can you use contribution which predated incorporation?



<P>3)<P>Contribution/advancements of $68,900 to the McD



<P>4)<P>Inability to utilize $8000 capital loss"344

<P>Mr. Foster's objective was to avoid calling attention to Whitewater during the annual audit of the President and Mrs. Clinton's tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service audit.345  One approach was simply to report a wash, that is, to show no loss and no gain from the venture, thereby obviating the need for any tax treatment.  The problem with such treatment, however, was that it would have bolstered the allegation that the Clintons were insulated from Whitewater losses and thus the company was a vehicle for Mr. McDougal to channel funds to the Clintons.

<P>In notes titled "Discussion Points," Mr. Foster wrote:

<P>1)<P>An argument that they were protected against loss:

<P><P>A)  wash is consistent with this theory346



But Mr. Foster did not a have a proper cost basis with which to calculate the Clintons' true losses or gains.  His discussion points continued:

<P>2)<P>Improper to reduce basis by improper tax benefit



<P>3)<P>Computation of economic loss was based, in part, on assumptions

<P><P>Whereas computation of tax gain or loss must be defensible in audit.347

<P>Therein lay the problem.  To claim a loss based on economic assumptions, as the Lyons report did, was one thing.8   But to claim a loss on the Clintons' 1992 tax returns without proper support and documentation increased the likelihood of calling attention to Whitewater during the IRS audit--of opening the can of worms that Mr. Foster and the Clintons' accountant wished to keep sealed.348

<P>Mr. Foster's notes summarized the options as follows:

<P>"10<P>Options

<P><P>$1000 basis<P>so no tax effect

<P><P>but is arbitrary & still risks audit

<P><P><P><P>    vs

<P><P>0 basis w/ $1000 gain

<P><P>avoids any audit of issue"349

<P>In a letter to Mr. Foster days before the tax returns were due, Ms. Redden, the accountant the Clintons hired to handle Whitewater tax issues, wrote:  "Because of the numerous problems with Whitewater records and the commingling of funds with other companies and individuals, I believe many explanations may have to be made if we claim a loss."350 This letter, addressed to Mr. Foster, was not among the documents in Mr. Foster's office that the White House produced to the Special Committee.  It was obtained by the Special Committee through another source.351  Ms. Redden testified that after the Clintons were in the White House she had a number of discussions with Mr. Foster concerning tax issues related to Whitewater.352  The main focus of these numerous communications was the tax basis for the Clintons' contributions to Whitewater and how to treat the $1000 payment.353

<P>The Clintons' final tax returns for 1992 reported a capital gain of $1000 from the sale of stock to Mr. McDougal.354  According to Ms. Redden, "I think we need to claim no gain or a loss."355  Mr. Foster did not follow her advice, however, because he was also consulting with another accountant, and "[a]t the end we compromised what we were going to put in the return in connection with Whitewater."356

IV.<P>The Clintons' Questionable Tax Treatment of Whitewater: A History of Unreportable Income and Improper Deductions



<P>During the years that the Clintons owned an interest in Whitewater, the Clintons adopted an aggressive approach to the tax treatment of their investment.  This approach sometimes resulted in errors on their federal income tax returns.  From 1978 to the early 1990s, the Clintons invested a total of $42,192 in Whitewater.357  During this same period, the Clintons deducted $42,656 of their Whitewater related expenses on their federal income tax returns -- almost $500 more than their total investment in the corporation.

<P>The Special Committee's analysis of the Clintons' treatment of individual Whitewater-related items on their federal income tax returns reveals that the Clintons took a number of questionable tax positions relating to Whitewater.  From 1992 to the present, the Clintons have admitted taking improper deductions of $7,928 and omitting income of $8,171 on their federal income tax returns during the period of their Whitewater investment.  Therefore, the Clintons have admitted understating their income by $16,099 during this period.  Based on its analysis of the available evidence, the Special Committee concluded that the Clintons could have understated their income on Whitewater related items by an additional $33,771, for a total increase in taxable income of $49,870.

<P>The Clintons have explained that errors on their tax returns relating to Whitewater were due to mistakes made by their accountants.  The Clintons did not fully disclose, however, all of their financial information to their accountants,358 did not discuss the details of important financial transactions with them,359 and sometimes simply ignored their accountant's advice.360

<P>Gaines Norton, the Clintons' personal accountant from 1978 to 1984, stated that the Clintons provided him with the information used to prepare their tax returns.361  According to Mr. Norton, a former IRS revenue agent and a certified public accountant, the Clintons did not provide him with underlying documents, but instead provided him with summaries,362 such as handwritten lists on notepads.363  In one case, Mr. Norton raised specific tax concerns about the structure of Whitewater and Mr. Clinton told him "to back off and leave the issue alone."364  The errors and questions discussed in this section, therefore, cannot be dismissed as merely mistakes by the Clintons' personal accountants.<P>  

<P>A.<P>1978: The Clintons' Unreported Income of $5,405 from 15-Acre Installment Sale



<P>The Clintons may have unreported income of $5,405 from their 1978 installment sale of 15 acres of land originally purchased from Rolling Manor Inc., a company owned and controlled by Mr. McDougal.  On January 25, 1977, then-Attorney General Clinton purchased 20 acres of land from Rolling Manor Inc. for $11,400.365  The Clintons' 1978 federal income tax return reports that they sold 20 acres of land in 1978 in two separate transactions, a cash sale of five acres and an installment sale of 15 acres.  On May 17, 1978, the Clintons sold five acres on a cash basis for $5,000, resulting in a gain of $2,150, which was properly reported on Schedule D (Capital Gains or Losses) of their 1978 return.366  On July 23, 1978, the Clintons sold 15 acres of unimproved land on the installment method for $14,985, resulting in a gain of $6,435.367  Since the Clintons elected to report this $6,435 gain on the installment method, only $886 of the gain was taxable in 1978 and was reported by the Clintons on their return.368  The $5,549 balance of the gain ($6,435 - $886) from this 15-acre land sale was to be reported in future years as the Clintons received the payments from the buyer.  

<P>$5,405 of the $5,549 deferred gain reported on the Clintons' 1978 return does not appear, however, in their subsequent federal income tax returns.  The Clintons did not report any income from the 15-acre installment sale on their 1979 tax return.369  The Clintons did report $144 in capital gains from an installment sale on Schedule D (Capital Gains and Losses) of their 1980 tax return.370  The Clintons did not report any income from the 15-acre installment sale on any of their tax returns after 1980.9   How the Clintons collected a total of $2,066 in 1978 on the sale of this 15 acre tract of land, collected no funds in 1979, collected a total of $335 in 1980, of which $144 was reported as a gain on their 1980 tax return, and then collected no other funds from the buyer remains unexplained.

<P>If the Clintons collected the funds due from the buyer of the 15-acre parcel, they were required to report a portion of each payment as a gain on their tax returns, just as they reported a $144 gain on their 1980 return.10   As described above, the Clintons reported no other gains on any of their subsequent returns.  Of course, if the Clintons did not receive payments from the buyer, they would not have been required to report gains on their income tax returns.  If the buyer of the property defaulted, however, the Clintons could have foreclosed on the property and then resold the property to another buyer, but there is no evidence on any of their subsequent tax returns that such action was taken by the Clintons.  In addition, if the buyer defaulted, the Clintons could have taken a $7,194 deduction for their remaining basis in the 15 acres, but there is no evidence of such a deduction on any of the Clintons subsequent tax returns.11   Moreover, if the property was foreclosed upon and not sold, then the Clintons would still own it, but this property is not shown on the Clintons 1991 Federal Election Disclosure form.371

<P>B.<P>1979: The Clintons' Improper Interest Deduction of $2,400 

<P>The $2,400 interest deduction claimed by the Clintons on their 1979 tax return may have been improper under federal income tax law.  On December 7, 1979, Whitewater deposited in its account a check from the Clintons in the amount of $2,900.372  On the books of Whitewater, this check was recorded as $500 for capital and $2,400 as "Loan - Bill Clinton".373  According to its books, Whitewater's first interest payment in the amount of $4,352.63 was made to Citizen's Bank of Flippin on May 5.374  On their 1979 federal income tax return, the Clintons claimed an interest deduction of $11,749 for payments to "Bank and Loan Companies."375  This amount included the Clintons' $2,400 payment to Whitewater.376

<P>Federal income tax law allows a deduction for "all interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on indebtedness,"377 but the burden of proof for establishing the propriety of an interest deduction is on the taxpayer.12   In this case, there is no evidence that the Clintons' $2,400 payment to Whitewater was for interest on indebtedness.  Indeed, the only available evidence, the $2,900 deposit slip and the entries on Whitewater's books, indicates that the $2,400 payment was a loan to the corporation, which the corporation had an obligation to repay, and not an interest payment.  Moreover, Whitewater did not make its first interest payment to a bank until May 5, 1980, almost five months after the Clintons' payment of $2,400 was deposited, and there is no evidence that Whitewater's first interest payment of $4,352.63 included the Clintons $2,400.378

<P>An IRS audit of the Clintons' 1979 income tax return resulted in no changes.  However, there is no evidence that the revenue agent reviewed all of the relevant documents regarding this interest deduction.379  Absent proof that Whitewater's books and records were made available to the revenue agent by the Clintons, the result of the 1979 audit is inconclusive on this issue.  Indeed, it is possible that the revenue agent would have reviewed only a canceled check or bank records, determined that less than the full payment was deducted, and accepted this as sufficient evidence to verify the deduction.

<P>C.<P>1980: The Clintons' Improper Interest Deduction of $9,000

<P>The $9,000 interest deduction claimed by the Clintons on their 1980 tax return may have been improper under federal income tax law.  On August, 23, 1980, Mrs. Clinton wrote a personal check in the amount of $9,000.380  The Clintons' deducted this $9,000 payment on their 1980 federal income tax return as interest paid to "James McDougal."381  A third-party endorsement by Citizens Bank of Flippin, dated September 5, 1980, is on the reverse side of the Clintons' check.382 

<P>Federal income tax law allows a deduction for "all interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on indebtedness,"383 but the burden of proof for establishing the propriety of an interest deduction is on the taxpayer.  In this case, there is no evidence that the Clintons' $9,000 payment was used to pay interest on indebtedness.  Nor is there evidence on the face of this check that it was intended to be used to pay interest.  The payee on the check was left blank, and there is no designation or notation on the check that it was intended to be used to pay interest.384<P>  In addition, the absence of a notation on the check that it was for interest is particularly probative, since Mrs. Clinton made such a notation on the other checks that she wrote to pay interest on the Whitewater debt.  Mrs. Clinton wrote at least four other personal checks to pay interest on Whitewater related debt -- three before and one after the $9,000 check, and, on each of these checks, Mrs. Clinton wrote a notation that the checks were for interest.13   Moreover, the Clintons' checkbook entry designates this check as a "land payment," not an interest payment.385  "Land payment" could refer either to a principal or interest payment.  Since Mrs. Clinton generally noted when a payment was for interest, however, her notation that this check was for a "land payment" would tend to confirm that this payment was for principal, not interest.   

<P>Analyses of the available bank records also indicate that the $9,000 check was used to pay principal, not interest.  A report prepared by Patten, McCarthy & Associates, a Denver accounting firm hired by the 1992 Clinton Presidential Campaign, states:

<P>In our telephone conversation with her [Mrs. Clinton] and you [James Lyons] on March 18, 1992, she reaffirmed that she believed that it was an interest payment. Based on our reconstruction of the probable amortization of the mortgage loan at Citizens Bank & Trust, we believe the $9,000 went to reduce principal.386

The report of Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro is even more conclusive on this point.  It states:

<P>On August 23, 1980, the Clintons paid $9,000 to an unknown payee.  Through a reconstruction of the Citizens Bank mortgage, it has been determined that this payment was applied as principal to the outstanding balance of the Citizens Bank loan.387

Thus, the available evidence indicates that the bank applied the $9,000 to reduce principal, not interest.

<P>According to the report prepared by the President and Mrs. Clinton's counsel, David Kendall, since the Clintons "owed interest to Citizens Bank of Flippin, WDC [Whitewater] or the McDougals, if they intended that their $9,000 check represents the interest, then Mr. and Mrs. Clinton accurately deducted the $9,000 payment as interest."388  However, there is no evidence of any unconditional and legally enforceable indebtedness between the Clintons and Whitewater or Mr. McDougal at the time of this payment.  While an indebtedness did exist between the Clintons and Citizens Bank, Mrs. Clinton's intent that a payment on the note was for interest is not sufficient to support an interest deduction under federal income tax law.

<P>Courts generally will give effect to an arrangement between a creditor and a debtor allocating payments on an indebtedness to principal and/or interest where that arrangement is bona fide and done at arm's length.389  There is no evidence of that such an arrangement existed between Mrs. Clinton and Citizen's Bank.  Nor is there evidence that Mrs. Clinton communicated to the bank or any other party that the payment was for interest.  Absent such an arrangement, payments by a debtor are first allocated to accrued but unpaid interest and then to principal.390

<P>The available evidence indicates that no accrued but unpaid interest was due on the Citizens Bank loan when the Clintons' $9,000 check was endorsed by Citizens Bank on September 5, 1980.  One month earlier, on August 5, 1980, the Citizens Bank note was extended and modified and, at the same time, the Clintons paid Citizens Bank the quarterly interest owing and due of $4,350, which they properly deducted on their 1978 return.391  No principal payment had been made on the loan as of the date of its renewal.392  Just 18 days later, Mrs. Clinton wrote the $9,000 check for "land payment."  The next quarterly interest payment on the note would not have been due until November 5, 1980, two months after Citizens Bank endorsed the Clintons' $9,000 check.

<P>D.<P>1980: The Clintons' Unreported Income of $10,000 from Whitewater payment of the $20,000 Union Bank Note

<P>Whitewater's 1980 payment of a 1978 $20,000 unsecured, personal note of Mr. McDougal and Mr. Clinton may have resulted in $10,000 of income to the Clintons that was not reported on their 1980 federal income tax return.  On June 19, 1978, Mr. McDougal and Mr. Clinton obtained a $20,000 unsecured, personal loan (Loan # 0004197) from Union National Bank of Little Rock.393  The proceeds of this loan were used to make the down payment on the 230 acres of land in Marion County, Arkansas that became Whitewater.394  On December 17, 1979, the Union National Bank note was renewed for 6 months, with a new maturity date of June 16, 1980.395  As of the date of that renewal, the principal of the note remained $20,000.396  On June 10, 1980, Mr. McDougal borrowed $20,000 from the Bank of Cherry Valley in Cherry Valley, Arkansas,397 and deposited those funds in Whitewater's account at the Union National Bank.398  On June 23, 1980, Whitewater disbursed $21,346.29 to Union National Bank, using a corporate check with the notation "For Note # 0004197 Plus interest thru 6/23/80," to pay off the accrued interest and principal owed personally by Mr. McDougal and Mr. Clinton to Union National Bank.399

<P>Section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code states that "gross income means all income from whatever source derived, including . . . income from discharge of indebtedness."400  Courts have ruled that amounts expended by a corporation for an individual taxpayer's benefit would constitute income to the taxpayer.401  Section 108(e)(4)(A) of the Code states that income is realized if debt is discharged or acquired by a related entity.402

<P>The central issue is whether Whitewater's payment to Union National Bank discharged any debt owed by Mr. Clinton.  Mr. McDougal and Mr. Clinton were jointly and severally liable on the Union National Bank note.403  Whitewater's incorporation did not change this, since the Union National Bank note was not transferred to Whitewater.404  Therefore, Whitewater's payment to Union National Bank eliminated Mr. Clinton's obligation to that bank.

<P>However, if Mr. Clinton was an obligor on the Bank of Cherry Valley note, from which Whitewater received the funds to pay Union National Bank, then Whitewater's debt would not have discharged any debt owed by Mr. Clinton.  In this case, the debt simply would have shifted from Union National Bank to the Bank of Cherry Valley.405 14   On the other hand, if Mr. Clinton was not an obligor on the Bank of Cherry Valley note, then Whitewater's payment would have discharged debt owed by Mr. Clinton.  In this case, the Union National Bank debt, on which Mr. Clinton was jointly and severally liable, would have been replaced by the Bank of Cherry Valley debt, on which Mr. Clinton was not liable.  In the latter case, Mr. Clinton would owe the IRS additional taxes on the $10,000 of discharged debt, his share of the Union Bank debt.

<P>Was Mr. Clinton an obligor on the Bank of Cherry Valley note?  Mr. Clinton has stated that "any shift of this $20,000 loan from Union Bank did not affect its character as an acquisition loan, for which my wife and I considered ourselves equally responsible with the McDougals for repayment."406  However, testimony by the Bank of Cherry Valley's former President, Maurice Smith, indicates that the loan was made to Mr. McDougal individually, and most of the bank documents support his testimony.  Indeed, Mr. Smith testified that the bank "just loaned it to Jim McDougal" and that Mr. Clinton did not make payments on the loan.407

<P>Most of the available loan documents indicate that Mr. McDougal was the sole obligor on the Bank of Cherry Valley note.408   Mr. McDougal's name, and not Mr. Clinton's, is typed on each of the documents, and Mr. McDougal signed each of the documents.409  Only one loan document appears to have Mr. Clinton's signature on it, and Mr. Clinton's name is not typed on that document.410  Moreover, that document is dated more than two years after the note was originated.411

<P>E.<P>1982: The Clintons' Unreported Income of $5,691 for Whitewater Payment of Citizens Bank of Jonesboro Note

<P>A 1982 payment by Whitewater of the principal and interest on a $5,000 note between the Citizens Bank of Jonesboro and Mr. Clinton may have resulted in $5,691.20 of income to the Clintons that was not reported on their 1982 federal income tax return.  A May 21, 1981 personal financial statement of the Clintons lists a $5,000 note payable to Citizens Bank of Jonesboro as a liability under the heading "general debt."412  On February 17, 1981, Mr. Clinton wrote a personal check in the amount of $243.82 to Citizens Bank, which had a notation "Interest on Note #585-270."413  On February 22, 1982, Whitewater disbursed a check in the amount of $5,691.20 to Citizens Bank.414  The notation on the check states "Note 585-270,"415 and the Whitewater checkbook entry designates this check as payment of "Note #585-270 - Bill Clinton."416

<P>Section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code states that "gross income means all income from whatever source derived, including . . . [i]ncome from discharge of indebtedness."417  Courts have ruled that amounts expended by a corporation for an individual taxpayer's benefit would constitute income to the taxpayer.418  Whitewater paid Mr. Clinton's note at Citizens Bank of Jonesboro, but Mr. Clinton has stated that "[i]t is possible that it was a WDC-related loan."419  If Mr. Clinton invested the proceeds of this loan in Whitewater and Whitewater then repaid the loan, Mr. Clinton would have received no personal benefit from Whitewater's payment of the note, and, therefore, would not have been required to recognize income from discharge of indebtedness.

<P>The evidence is inconclusive on whether this Citizens Bank of Jonesboro loan was related to Whitewater.  A March 1, 1982 letter from Jim McDougal to Bill Clinton states:

<P>I have paid from the Whitewater Development Corporation the note you owed Citizens Bank of Jonesboro.  You are correct in your belief that the sum of money borrowed was part of your investment in Whitewater. 420   

<P><P>

Yet, there is no evidence on Whitewater's books that it received $5,000 from either the Clintons or Citizens Bank of Jonesboro.421 15   Indeed, when Whitewater disbursed $5,691 to Citizens Bank of Jonesboro, it recorded the full amount as "interest" paid, which indicates that the corporation had never recorded a liability that could be reduced upon payment of the note.422

<P>Although the evidence is inconclusive on whether these funds were invested in Whitewater, under federal income tax law the Clintons would bear the burden of proof that this payment did not result in any benefit to them personally.  It is unclear whether the March 1, 1982 McDougal letter would be considered sufficient proof that the Clintons invested the funds received from the Citizens Bank of Jonesboro in Whitewater.  If found insufficient, the Clintons would have unreported income of $5,691.20, excluding any interest and penalties.

<P>F.<P>1984: The Clintons' Improper Deduction of $144 for Real Estate Taxes

<P>On their 1984 federal income tax return, the Clintons improperly deducted $144 for real estate tax payments for which they were reimbursed by Whitewater.  On October 10, 1984, the Clintons paid $144 to Marion County for the payment of real estate taxes on Whitewater lot 13.  On November 4, 1984, Whitewater reimbursed the Clintons for this amount.423  Since the Clintons were reimbursement for the taxes paid, this deduction was improper.  On May 24, 1996, the Clintons acknowledged this error and repaid the federal taxes owed to the Bureau of Public Debt and the state taxes owed to an Arkansas charity.424

<P>G.<P>1984 and 1985: The Clintons' Improper Interest Deductions of $2,811 and $2,322



<P>On their 1984 and 1985 federal income tax returns, the Clintons improperly deducted $5,133 for interest payments made paid by Whitewater, not the Clintons.425  In 1984 and 1985, Whitewater made interest payments to the Security Bank of Paragould in the amounts of $2,811 and $2,322, respectively, that the corporation deducted on its corporate tax returns.426  The Clintons also claimed these same interest deductions on their 1984 and 1985 federal income tax returns.427  Since Whitewater made the interest payments to the bank, it, and not the Clintons, was entitled to those deductions.  On December 28, 1993, almost two years after the errors were first reported, the Clintons repaid the taxes owed due to these errors.428  The Clintons did not explain the delay.429  

<P>H.<P>1987: The Clintons' Improper Interest Deduction of $2,561

<P>On their 1987 federal income tax return, the Clintons improperly deducted $1,636 for interest which they also deducted on their 1986 federal income tax return.  On December 30, 1986, Mrs. Clinton wrote a check in the amount of $1,635.51 to Security Bank of Paragould.430  On their 1986 federal income tax return, the Clintons deducted $1,636 for interest paid to "Security Bank."431  In 1987, Security Bank of Paragould sent the Clintons a statement of interest paid on their loan during 1987, which listed interest paid of $2,561.33.432 On their 1987 federal income tax return, the Clintons deducted $2,561 in interest paid to "Security Bank.433

<P>The $2,561 of interest deducted on the Clintons' 1987 tax return improperly included the $1,635.51 payment made by the Clintons in 1986 and deducted on their 1986 tax return.  The $925 balance of this amount ($2,561 - $1,636) was also improperly deducted by the Clintons on their 1987 tax return.  This interest was paid by Hillman Logan, the owner of Whitewater lot 13.  On May 24, 1996, the Clintons acknowledged these errors and repaid the federal taxes owed to the Bureau of Public Debt and state taxes owed to an Arkansas charity.434

<P>Documents show that the Mrs Clinton may have discussed this error with her personal accountant, Yoly Redden, and Loretta Lynch on March 23, 1992 -- almost four years before the Clintons acknowledged the error. Notes taken by Ms. Redden of a March 23, 1992 telephone conversation between herself, Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Lynch state:

<P>Clinton Campaign - Issue discussed with HC & Loretta Lynch

<P>1987<P>$2,651 deducted per return to Security Bank of Paragould. [found canceled check from Clintons dated 12/30/86 check # 1623 for 1635.51.]

<P>1986<P>1,636 paid [an arrow in Ms. Redden's notes points from this entry to the 1987 entry]435

Ms. Redden testified that in this conversation she had discussed with Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Lynch whether or not certain deductions had been "double-counted" on the Clintons' 1986 and 1987 federal income tax returns and that this issue had been discussed even prior to this conversation.436

<P>I.<P>1988: The Clintons' Improper Deduction of $1,275 for Real Estate Taxes



<P>The $1,275 real estate tax deduction claimed by the Clintons on their 1988 tax return may have been improper under federal income tax law.  On October 28, 1988, Mrs. Clinton reimbursed Ozark Realty $1,275.15 for real estate taxes due on several Whitewater lots.437  On their 1988 federal income tax return the Clintons deducted $1,275 as real estate taxes.438  Generally, only the owner of real property is entitled to deduct real property taxes on the property, since those taxes are the liability of the owner under federal income tax law.439  Since the Clintons did not own the property on which the taxes were assessed, they were not entitled to a deduction for the payment of those real estate taxes.  A taxpayer who owns a beneficial interest in property and who pays taxes thereon to protect that interest may deduct the taxes, even though legal title is in another.440  Beneficial interest is narrowly defined, however, and does not appear to the Clintons interest, if any, in the lots on which these real estate property taxes were assessed.  Therefore, the Clintons' $1,275 payment to Ozark Realty for real estate taxes may not be an allowable deduction.

<P>J.<P>1988: The Clintons' Unreported Income of $1,673 from the Sale of Lot 13



<P>On May 24, 1996, the Clintons acknowledged that they under-reported the capital gain from the sale of a Whitewater lot owned by Mrs. Clinton by $1,673 on their 1988 federal income tax return.441  On that return, the Clintons reported a $1,640 long-term capital gain from the sale of lot 13.442  In computing the capital gain from this sale, the Clintons included in their basis calculation payments made by the previous owner of the lot.443  As a result, the cost of the property was artificially inflated by $1,673, reducing the gain reported by the Clintons by this same amount on their 1988 tax return.  The have repaid the federal taxes owed to the Bureau of Public Debt and the state taxes owed to an Arkansas charity.444

<H3>Part II. GOVERNOR CLINTON'S QUESTIONABLE RELATIONSHIP WITH JAMES MCDOUGAL</H3>



<P>While Mr. McDougal was carrying the Clintons share on the Whitewater loans, Governor Clinton, using the power of his political office, acted favorably on Mr. McDougal's other business ventures and accepted Mr. McDougal's recommendations regarding state action.  These favors took the form of granting Mr. McDougal influence in appointments to state positions445, steering lucrative state leases to Madison Guaranty446, and making decisions for Mr. McDougal concerning state regulators.447  This pattern of favoritism was important to Mr. McDougal, whose thrift was experiencing serious financial trouble. 

<P>The motive for this favoritism is clear.  From the standpoint of Governor Clinton, if Madison Guaranty failed or Mr. McDougal experienced financial troubles, the Clintons could be liable for the full Whitewater debt.  Thus, Governor Clinton had a reason to act to ensure the viability of Mr. McDougal's savings & loan, even if such action was adverse to the interests of the state.

I.<P>James McDougal's Madison Guaranty: A Corrupt Savings & Loan

<P>In January 1982, James and Susan McDougal, along with several others, purchased 90% of the stock of the Woodruff County Savings & Loan Association for $246,500, which they renamed Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan Association ("Madison Guaranty").448  To finance the purchase of Madison Guaranty, the McDougals borrowed $70,000 from Worthen Bank. Mr. McDougal inaccurately indicated on the change of control applications that he had obtained the money through "funds received from closely held corporations." 449 In June 1983, the McDougals borrowed another $142,186 from Worthen Bank to acquire stock belonging to other investors in Madison Guaranty in order to acquire exclusive control over the S&L.450

<P>Mr. McDougal's true interest was always real estate investments, and his control of Madison Guaranty allowed him to pursue such investments.  On the other hand, Madison Bank & Trust, Mr. McDougal's other federal institution, was prohibited from such investments.451  In early 1982, Mr. McDougal incorporated Madison Financial Corporation as a subsidiary of Madison Guaranty for the sole purpose of real estate investment.452

<P>From the beginning, Mr. McDougal viewed Madison Guaranty as a personal "candy store."453  Soon after its purchase Mr. McDougal began to borrow personally from Madison Guaranty to pay down other loans including financing Whitewater.454  

<P> In 1984, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board ("FHLBB") examined Madison Guaranty and concluded that "[t]he viability of the institution is jeopardized through the institution's current investment and lending practices in real estate development projects."  The FHLBB attempted to force Madison, through a cease and desist order and a supervisory agreement, to stop lending money to the McDougals or any McDougal-controlled entity, and require Madison Guaranty to raise additional capital.

<P>Shortly thereafter, Mr. McDougal hired Mrs. Clinton and the Rose Law Firm to represent Madison Guaranty and then-Governor Clinton appointed Beverly Bassett Schaffer to the position of Arkansas Securities Commissioner, based possibly on Mr. McDougal's recommendation.  Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Schaffer discussed -- and Ms. Schaffer approved -- a novel proposal for Madison Guaranty to raise capital through the issuance of preferred stock.  Ms. Clinton and the Rose Law Firm also represented Madison Guaranty in connection with land transactions and real estate investments, notably Castle Grande.

<P>  Beginning in March 1986, the FHLBB again examined Madison Guaranty.455  James Clark, the examiner-in-charge, testified that the examiner discovered "a group of insiders was obtaining cash in what amounted to a pyramid scheme" led by the principal insider, James McDougal.456

<P>Mr. Clark testified that in his 20 years as a bank examiner, Madison Guaranty was on of the top five worst financial institutions that he examined in terms of self dealing by insiders.457  The 1986 examination report concluded that "management blatantly disregarded numerous regulations," "ignored" parts of the Supervisory Agreement.458  Moreover the report stated that Mr. McDougal's effective control of Madison Guaranty "enabled [him] to use corporate resources to develop large land developments [and] to divert substantial amounts of funds from the projects to himself and others."459  The examiners cited Campobello, Maple Creek, and Castle Grande as problematic projects.460  Although Madison Guaranty's financial statements indicated that the institution was in the black, the FHLBB report noted that improper accounting appeared to be the source of the profit, not successful investing. The report stated that, "[i]f profits [of the real estate projects] were booked properly, the Institution would be, in fact, insolvent."461

<P>A.<P>Madison's Fraudulent Land Deals<P>

<P>Examiner Clark testified that Mr. McDougal "had total control of Madison Guaranty funds" and that Mr. McDougal could "dispense those funds at any time he wished, and he did so through the land development projects."462  The 1986 federal examination uncovered several instances where Madison Guaranty insiders engaged in "sham transactions" or acted as a "straw man," an arrangement whereby the "purchaser of the property would obtain legal title to a property without having any actual financial interest in the property simply as a means to hide true ownership of the property."463   The sham transactions were used as a means to place phony profit on the books in attempt to falsely inflate net worth.464

<P>  

<P>For example, the 1986 examination found that the Castle Grande project was "purchased and sold in a series of fictitious transactions" to straw buyers.465  At the recently concluded McDougal-Tucker trial, Don Denton, chief lending officer of Madison, testified that Seth Ward was a "nominee" buyer in the purchase of part of the land.466  These transactions were structured in this way to enable Madison Guaranty to violate the Arkansas state regulation prohibiting Madison Guaranty from investing more than 6% of its assets into Madison Financial Corporation.467

<P>Bank examiners also found that Madison Guaranty insiders obtained financing for real estate projects that were fully funded by Madison Guaranty.468  In addition, insiders received real estate commissions that they did not earn.469   

<P>B.<P>Madison's Phony Books and Records  

<P>The 1984 examination of Madison Guaranty had concluded that the books and records were "inadequate."470  The books and records at Madison Guaranty were "poor, missing, and in some cases, intentionally misleading."471  The loan files did not sufficiently document the disbursements of the loan proceeds.472<P>  Mr. Denton testified that prior to the arrival of the examiners in March 1986, the staff of Madison Guaranty went through the loan files to find out what was missing, back dated documents, and had phony appraisals prepared.473  Robert Palmer, a Madison appraiser, confirmed that he prepared several inflated appraisals for Madison Guaranty and backdated several appraisals.474  Moreover, Mr. Clark testified that the appraisals were "wholly inadequate" and "the reports seemed to us to be essentially shams, some documents to put into the loan file."475

<P>The 1986 FHLBB examination of Madison Guaranty lasted from March through September of 1986, as opposed to the three to four weeks that it would normally take for an S&L that size, because "Madison Guaranty's problems were so severe and its records were so poor."476  Moreover, Madison Guaranty's management actively obstructed the examination by retaining needed loan files or withholding information.477  

<P>  C.<P>Federal Regulators Oust Mr. McDougal from Madison 

<P>On June 19, 1986, Walter Faulk, the FHLBB's Supervisory Agent responsible for Madison Guaranty, issued the preliminary report of the examination.478  This report was so devastating that the Arkansas Securities Commissioner Beverly Bassett Schaffer believed it "effectively put Madison out of business."479<P>  

<P>Curiously, on July 2, 1986, Ms. Schaffer forwarded a letter which Mr. Faulk had sent to Madison Guaranty, to Samuel Bratton, then Counsel to Governor Clinton, with a personal note attached.  The note stated, "Madison Guaranty is in pretty serious trouble.  Because of Bill's relationship with McDougal we probably ought to talk about it."480  Mr. Bratton, who had already spoken with Governor Clinton several times about Madison Guaranty's financial difficulties, was well aware of the Governor's personal ties to Mr. McDougal.481  After Mr. Bratton received the note, he spoke with Ms. Schaffer about the possible closure of Madison Guaranty by the FHLBB,482 and the upcoming FHLBB meeting in Dallas on July 24 where Madison's financial problems would be discussed.483  After Mr. Bratton received Ms. Schaffer's memorandum he contacted Governor Clinton, telling him of the FHLBB's plans.484  Mr. Bratton also went to see Betsey Wright, the Governor's Chief of Staff, and they "together carried this to the Governor rather than my sending it in his normal mail."485  

<P>Although the exact date of Governor Clinton's receipt of the copy of the FHLBB's letter is unknown, he certainly received it before July 14, 1986.486  It is clear that Governor Clinton knew that Mr. McDougal -- his business partner, friend, and client of his wife's law firm -- was in serious financial trouble before it was ever made public.

<P>Results of an examination by the FHLBB are to be kept confidential, and "[t]he law requires that release of an exam report be restricted."487  Bank regulators should not share the results of exams with anyone outside of the regulatory agency.   James Clark, the FHLBB examiner, could not think of one reason why it would be appropriate for a state bank regulator to tip off the governor's office with regard to an ongoing bank examination.488  Moreover, Mr. Clark testified that, given Governor Clinton's business relationship with Mr. McDougal, the "tip off" from Ms. Schaffer certainly "had the appearance of a conflict."489 

<P>On July 11, 1986 the Federal Home Loan Bank Board met to discuss Madison.  Ms. Schaffer, her associate Charles Handley, nine persons from the FHLBB, and the Madison Board of Directors were all present.490   Mr. and Mrs. McDougal were not present.491  Mr. Clark expressed some concerns about Ms. Schaffer's presence at the FHLBB meeting because she had performed legal work for Madison Guaranty when she was in private practice, and he viewed that as a conflict with her oversight capacity as the Arkansas Securities Commissioner.492

<P>During the meeting, Dawn Pulcer of the FHLBB mentioned that she thought Ms. Schaffer's conduct during the meeting was peculiar.  Ms. Pulcer's contemporaneous notes of the meeting reflect that during the course of discussion at the FHLBB meeting Ms. Schaffer appeared to be frowning, and asked only one question: "[w]ho is representing the McDougals?"493  Ms. Pulcer stated that she "[t]hought it was a little odd.  I, too, would have expected her to say something in support of the actions that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board supervisory authorities were taking."494

<P>At this meeting, FHLBB determined that Mr. McDougal and Mr. Latham should be removed from Madison.  On July 14, 1986, just three days after this meeting, Ms. Wright wrote a telling message to Governor Clinton that reads:

<P>          White Water stock<BR>

          (McDougal's company)<BR></P>



<P>          Do you still have? (pursuant<BR>

          to Jim's current problems<BR>

                             </P> 

<P>          If so, I'm worried about<BR>

          it.495<BR></P>





Governor Clinton responded by writing "No-Do not have any more---B."496  Ms. Wright claimed it was then well known that Mr. McDougal had been removed from the bank.  But the local newspaper did not report the event until July 25, 1996, eleven days later.497  

<P>Curiously, on the very same day that Ms. Wright inquired about Governor Clinton's relationship with Mr. McDougal, Mrs. Clinton wrote a letter to Mr. McDougal and Mr. Latham terminating the Rose Law Firm's retainer agreement with Madison Guaranty.498  Along with the letter, Mrs. Clinton sent a check from the Rose Law Firm refunding Madison Guaranty's outstanding retainer balance.499    

<P>Mrs. Clinton has given at least two different accounts regarding why she terminated the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison Guaranty.500  In a press conference on April 22, 1994, Mrs. Clinton said that the Rose Law Firm's relationship with Madison Guaranty was terminated because Madison Guaranty could not meet the requirements imposed by Ms. Schaffer for the issuance of preferred stock.501  However, in response to interrogatories on February 4, 1994, Mrs. Clinton said that the representation of Madison Guaranty was terminated due to "the increasing work the Rose Law Firm was doing for FSLIC ... the firm had decided in early July, 1986, generally to avoid taking on any new or expanded representations of S&L's."502  In Mrs. Clinton's February 14, 1996 interview with the FDIC, Mrs. Clinton stated that the letter to Madison Guaranty was written in direct response to a memorandum written by Herb Rule, then the managing partner of the Rose Law Firm, to all attorneys.503  

II.<P>Governor Clinton Provides Benefits to James McDougal and Madison S&L



<P>During the time when Mr. McDougal was running Madison Guaranty and carrying the Clintons on the Whitewater investment, Governor Clinton acted favorably on Mr. McDougal's various proposals before the state.  Indeed, substantial evidence supports Mr. McDougal's claims that he had "clout" with the Governor.504   

<P>A.<P>Governor Clinton Steers Valuable State Leases to Madison



<P>Governor Clinton exercised the power of his office to steer two lucrative lease contracts to Madison Guaranty.505  Helen Herr, the former Leasing Administrator for Arkansas State Building Services ("ASBS"), testified that she first learned in January or February 1984 that Madison Guaranty was interested in leasing space to Arkansas Housing Development Agency ("AHDA") during a meeting in the office of Paul Mallard.506  Mr. Mallard, the Director of ASBS called Ms. Herr into his office to meet Susan McDougal. Mr. Mallard told Ms. Herr that the McDougals were developing a building on South Main Street in Little Rock, in Quapaw Quarter, and that they had additional office space that they wanted to rent.507  This office space was difficult to lease because it was located in an unsafe part of Little Rock and the real estate market in Little Rock was soft. Many commercial landlords were eager to fill their office space with long term tenants.508

<P>In fall 1983, AHDA developed a need for additional office space.  ASBS was considering office space on Brookwood Drive that the Director of AHDA, Wooten Epes, felt would be suitable.509  After meeting with Mrs. McDougal, Mr. Mallard instructed Ms. Herr to examine the Madison office space.510  

<P>When Mr. Epes, AHSA's Director, complained to Ms. Herr about the Madison space, she recommended that he state his complaints in writing.  On March 5, 1984, Mr. Epes wrote a letter to Ms. Herr rejecting the proposal that AHDA lease the office space from Madison.511  Mr. Epes was concerned that the Madison space was not sufficiently large and was not located in a safe part of Little Rock.512  When Ms. Herr brought Mr. Epes' letter to Mr. Mallard's attention, Mr. Mallard told her that the leasing contract was going to Madison Guaranty because the McDougals were "friends" of the Governor.513  Ms. Herr specifically testified: "When I presented the objections from Mr. Epes about the Madison space, [Mallard] said that the governor's office wants us to lease that space ... and that the McDougals were friends" of Governor and Mrs. Clinton.514  Mr. Mallard also told her that "they weren't going to consider other proposals" because the "governor's office wants us to lease this space and that's the way it's going to be."515  Mr. Epes took his concerns to the Governor.516  Mr. Epes testified that Governor Clinton refused to overrule Mr. Mallard's decision, and that was the Governor's final word.517

<P>On April 1, 1984, the AHDA entered into a lease with Madison Guaranty.518  The lease was for a 60-month term at $4,800 per month.519  The contract realized nearly $300,000 in payments to Madison.520 

<P>In 1985 AHDA became the Arkansas Development Finance Authority ("ADFA").521  ADFA subsequently sought to lease additional office space for their new employees.522  As a result of this change, ADFA entered into another contract with Madison.523  In August 1987, however, ADFA canceled its lease with Madison because it needed still more space, which was the concern that Mr. Epes had from the beginning.524

<P>Moreover, the State of Arkansas, through ASBS, leased space in an additional building from Mr. McDougal, in Quapaw Quarter, to house the Arkansas Revenue Department.525  Other than the three leases entered into with McDougal-owned entities, Ms. Herr could not recall any other leases the state entered for office space in the lease in Quapaw Quarter.526

<P>Don Denton, a Madison loan officer, believed that the state leases were a political payback by Governor Clinton to the McDougals.  Mr. Denton testified that the connection "[s]tood out like a beacon at night."527<P>

<P>B.<P>McDougal Holds a Questionable 1985 Fundraiser for Clinton

 

<P>On April 4, 1985, James McDougal hosted a fundraiser for Governor Clinton at Madison Guaranty to raise money to pay off the Governor's outstanding personal debt from his 1984 gubernatorial campaign.528  In the closing days of that race, Governor Clinton had obtained an unsecured personal loan in the amount of $50,000 from the Bank of Cherry Valley. 529  

<P>The exact amount of money raised at the event is not known.  The campaign finance report listing the contributions received at the fundraiser is missing from the Pulaski County Clerk's office and has never been located.  By all accounts, however, the fundraiser netted more than $30,000 to pay off Governor Clinton's personal debt.16 

<P>Four $3,000 checks were collected at the fundraiser.530  The names on the checks were James B. and Susan McDougal, J.W. Fulbright, Ken Peacock, and Dean Landrum.531  J.W. Fulbright is the late former Senator.  Ken Peacock is the son of former Madison director and borrower Charles Peacock.532  Dene Landrum, who is now deceased, was Mr Peacock's business associate.533   His first name was misspelled on the check as "Dean."534

<P>All four checks were dated April 4, 1985.535  The James McDougal check was written on the McDougal's personal checking account at Madison Guaranty and was signed by Susan McDougal.536  The Fulbright, Peacock, and Landrum checks were Madison Guaranty cashier's checks bearing numbers 2496, 2497, and 2498, respectively.537  

<P>There is strong evidence suggesting that the $3,000 check in Senator Fulbright's name was purchased by Mr. McDougal out of funds from his Flowerwood Farms account.  Senator Fulbright did not attend the fundraiser, although he was expected to.538  In 1994, Kent Goss, an RTC investigator, questioned Senator Fulbright's lawyer, a former aide to the Senator, about the $3,000 check.539 17   Mr. Goss wrote that although it was "evident" that Senator Fulbright was "a meticulous record-keeper," there was no record of any charitable donation in the amount of $3,000 between 1984 and 1991.540  Nor did Senator Fulbright's bank statements reflect a $3,000 debit during the relevant time.541  Senator Fulbright's lawyer added that he believed that the Senator had "no knowledge" of a $3,000 contribution to Governor Clinton.542 

<P>The Pillsbury Madison & Sutro Report on Madison Guaranty and Whitewater commissioned by the Resolution Trust Corporation attempted to trace the source of funds of the Fulbright check.543  According to this report, on April 4, 1985, the same day that the Fulbright check was issued, a $3,000 check payable to Madison Guaranty was written on Flowerwood Farms' account at Madison Guaranty.544  The Flowerwood Farms check was apparently deposited in the Madison cashier's check account, as it was encoded with "7001312" -- the number of that account.545  A $3,000 deposit was posted in the account 7001312 on April 4, 1985.546

<P>Despite this evidence, the Pillsbury Report erroneously concluded that the link between the Flowerwood Farms check and the Fulbright check "has not been conclusively confirmed" because Madison Guaranty issued two other cashier's checks for $3,000 on April 4, 1985, i.e., those in the names of Ken Peacock and Dean Landrum.547  However, Charles Peacock, an attendee and donor at the fundraiser, has admitted to purchasing those two checks.548  The Pillsbury report recognized: "[I]f the Ken Peacock and Dene Landrum cashier's checks were funded by Charles Peacock III, the Flowerwood Farms check could have funded the remaining $3,000 cashier's check, the one from Fulbright."549

<P>Mr. Peacock's testimony establishes, and the documentary evidence confirms, that he caused the checks to be issued.  Mr. Peacock admitted that he purchased the $3,000 checks in the names of his son and Dene Landrum.550  Mr. Peacock said he bought the check in his son's name because he thought it might help his son secure a job with Governor Clinton.551  He testified that he bought the check in Mr. Landrum's name because Mr. Landrum wanted to help the child of a friend receive a scholarship awarded by Governor Clinton.552  

<P>The documentary evidence is consistent with Mr. Peacock's admission that he procured the checks.  On April 4, 1985, Mr. Peacock wrote a $6,000 counter check payable to Madison Guaranty, apparently on his account #15253.553  The check was encoded with "7001312" -- the number of the Madison cashier's checking account.  That same day, Mr. Peacock purchased a cashier's check for $4.554  Madison Guaranty charged a $2 fee for cashier's checks.555  When asked whether he bought this cashier's check to pay the $4 fee on the two $3,000 checks, Mr. Peacock said, "I'm sure that's what happened."556  It seems clear that since Mr. Peacock purchased two of the $3,000 cashiers checks, the third $3,000 check was purchased with proceeds from Flowerwood Farms.

<P>There is evidence that Mr. Peacock purchased the Ken Peacock and Dean Landrum checks with proceeds diverted from loans made by Madison Guaranty.  

<P>On the day of the fundraiser, April 4, 1985, Dixie Continental Leasing, a company owned by Mr. Peacock, purchased 29.77 acres of land on Woodson Lateral Road for $335,000.557  Most of the sale was financed by Madison Guaranty with a $297,000 mortgage.558  Mr. Peacock borrowed an additional $50,000 from Madison Guaranty in his own name to fund the down payment on the property.559  The loan was executed on April 5, 1985, but was funded on April 4, 1985, with a $50,000 Madison Guaranty check payable to Mr. Peacock.560  The loan was secured by commercial air conditioning equipment appraised at $273,000 but ultimately sold as scrap by Madison Guaranty for $1,500.561

<P>On April 5, 1985, Mr. Peacock wrote a check for $38,940 to Quapaw Title Co. to pay the down payment on the Woodson Lateral Road property.562  The check was deposited in Madison Guaranty.563  There is no documentary evidence indicating what happened to the remaining $11,060.  Mr. Peacock does not remember how the remaining $11,060, a sum sufficient to fund the checks to Governor Clinton, was spent.564  Moreover, he does not recall what funds he used to pay for the cashier's checks:  "I don't remember how I paid for them, whether I paid for them with a check or whether I paid for them out of funds or what I did."565

<P>The Pillsbury Report concludes that the source of funds for Mr. Ken Peacock's and Mr. Landrum's checks "cannot be established from the available documentation,"566 because Mr. Peacock's April 1985 Madison Guaranty bank statement is missing.567  Thus, it is not possible to ascertain what Mr. Peacock's balance was when he wrote the $6,000 check to Madison Guaranty, or what it would have been absent the infusion of an extra $11,060.568  Nevertheless, the Pillsbury Report does indicate that "it is possible that a portion of this $11,060 could have been used to reimburse Charles Peacock III for the campaign contributions he funded that were made in the names of Ken Peacock and Dene Landrum."569

<P>In spring 1987, after Mr. McDougal was ousted from Madison Guaranty, the S&L filed several suits against Mr. Peacock, other members of his family, and related entities to recover on unpaid loans.570  On March 12, 1987, Madison Guaranty filed suit against Dixie Continental Leasing to recover on the loan executed on the day of the fundraiser.571  On April 1, 1987, Madison Guaranty filed four additional suits against the Peacocks and their companies.572  In all, Madison Guaranty sought to recover approximately $500,000 from the Peacocks with these suits.573

<P>Madison Guaranty was represented in these actions by Lance Miller of the law firm of Mitchell, Williams, Selig & Tucker ("Tucker Firm").574  Patricia Heritage, a Madison Guaranty collections officer, was the Madison Guaranty liaison to the Mitchell Williams attorneys with respect to these cases.575

<P>On April 21, 1987, Greg Hopkins, Mr. Peacock's attorney, visited Ms. Heritage in her office.576  Ms. Heritage testified that Mr. Hopkins was obviously angry and made certain allegations to her involving, the Dixie Continental loan, Mr. McDougal, and the Clinton campaign.577  Immediately after Mr. Hopkins left, Ms. Heritage called Mr. Miller to relate Mr. Hopkins' allegations.578  

<P>Mr. Miller took contemporaneous notes of his conversation with Ms. Heritage,579 which he then memorialized in a three-page memorandum, addressed to John Selig, the partner on the matter.580  Ms. Heritage confirmed that Mr. Miller's memorandum accurately reflects what Mr. Hopkins said to her.581

<P>Mr. Miller's memorandum reflects that Mr. Hopkins claimed that there had been "substantial wrongdoing" at Madison Guaranty as a result of which people were "going to go to prison."582  Mr. Hopkins also made the serious allegation that "a portion of the loan proceeds made to Dixie Continental Leasing went to Bill Clinton's campaign and that in return for the substantial campaign contribution, Bill Clinton assured Jim McDougal that a state agency would lease space from Madison Guaranty at its headquarters on Main Street in Little Rock."583  

<P>There is every reason to believe that Mr. Hopkins actually made the serious and troubling allegations attributed to him, and that Mr. Miller's memo accurately reflects what Mr. Hopkins.   Ms. Heritage's memory of the conversation is vivid.584  Indeed, Ms. Heritage testified that Mr. Hopkins "was angry and shouting" at her, and that "that's the sort of thing that would stick out" in her mind.585 

<P>It appears that Mr. Hopkins did not make these allegations out of whole cloth.  Ms. Heritage testified that, with respect to the allegations about campaign contributions to Governor Clinton, she "thought it was entirely possible that it was true."586  She thought Mr. Hopkins may have been "posturing," but not lying.587

<P>Although Mr. Hopkins did not recall speaking with Ms. Heritage in April 1987 or making allegations, he did not dispute that he may have done so and has no reason to doubt Ms. Heritage's recollection.588  

<P>Mr. Hopkins testified that he could not think of a "conceivable reason for making up an allegation about the Governor and Jim McDougal exchanging money for favors."589  He also testified that "it was not [his] habit to lie or make up baseless allegations."590  He acknowledged that the allegations about Governor Clinton are serious and not the sort of thing that he would say without a basis for doing so.591  Mr. Hopkins admitted that he "probably had suspicions."592

<P>Moreover, Mr. Hopkins was likely in a position to learn about the diversion of loan proceeds to Governor Clinton and Madison Guaranty's award of a lease contract through his representation of Mr. Peacock, who owned Dixie Continental and was a Madison director.  However, Mr. Hopkins, invoked the attorney-client privilege and refused to answer questions about what Mr. Peacock has told him.593  

<P>If Mr. Hopkins did make the statements attributed to him, and they were false, he would be in violation of an Arkansas ethical rule.594  The Rule states: "In the course of representing a client a lawyer shall not knowingly . . . make a false statement of material fact or law to a third person."

<P>The memorandum written by Mr. Miller reflects that Mr. Hopkins said that "in return for the substantial campaign contribution, Bill Clinton assured McDougal that a state agency would lease space from Madison Guaranty at its headquarters on Main Street in Little Rock."595  Indeed, on August 13, 1985, the State of Arkansas awarded a contract to expand the Madison lease office space in its Main Street office to the Arkansas Development Finance Authority (ADFA).596  Governor Clinton had previously used his influence to steer an ADFA lease contract to Madison Guaranty.597 

<P>C.<P>Governor Clinton Vetoes Legislation For McDougal Business Partners

<P>The 1985 McDougal fundraiser appears to have been used as leverage to secure action by Governor Clinton on proposed state legislation. On February 14, 1986, Castle Sewer & Water Company -- an entity owned by Jim Guy Tucker and R.D. Randolph -- entered an agreement to purchase the sewer and water system at Castle Grande for $1.2 million.598  On July 15, 1986, following Mr. McDougal's removal from the Madison Guaranty, there was a special meeting of its Board of Directors.599  At the meeting, Mr. Tucker explained to the board that he had an old agreement with Mr. McDougal for 110 utility hook-ups per year and that, although the utility company was not a registered public utility under Arkansas Law, it was not a problem.  

<P>Mr. Tucker raised a number of issues in the July 15, 1986 meeting.  Some of the concerns voiced by Mr. Tucker brought into question the validity of legal work performed by Hillary Clinton and the Rose Law Firm.<P>  

<P>Mrs. Clinton supervised Rose Law Firm associate Rick Donovan's analysis on the need for Castle Sewer and Water to register as a public utility with the Arkansas Public Service Commission.600  The memorandum concluded that the cost of becoming a "public utility" -- and thus being regulated by the Public Service Commission -- would be greater than the risk of being reported by a resident to the Public Service Commission.601  Such a citizen report would simply require the payment of a civil fine.602  Mrs. Clinton, after reviewing various memoranda and billing records, recalled that she supervised Mr. Donovan on certain "questions relating to the provisions of water and sewer service by a utility which was located within IDC property."603  

<P>It is not clear exactly what work was performed by the Rose Law Firm on the utility issues related to Castle Grande because Mrs. Clinton ordered those client records destroyed in July 1988.604  But, the work performed by Mrs. Clinton clearly became an issue when Mr. Tucker threatened to sue Madison Guaranty, which was under then the "close scrutiny of FSLIC"605, for recision.606  

<P>The sale of the sewer and water system occurred on February 28, 1986.607  Yet, the Rose Law Firm continued to do work on utility related issues and continued to bill Madison Guaranty.608  Six days after the final transfer of the Industrial Service Corporation stock to Castle Sewer, Mr. Donovan wrote a memorandum on whether "Madison Guaranty/IDC" can provide services to customers inside Little Rock's city limits.609  Mr. Donovan could not explain why he was preparing a legal memorandum for a client who had sold the utility a week earlier.610  

<P>The Rose Law Firm charged Madison Guaranty thousands of dollars for work on utility issues.611  There may have been work performed on utility issues in January 1986, the bill which reflected 14.5 hours of unaccounted billing by Mrs. Clinton for Madison.612  

<P>Two years later, the utility work performed by the Rose Law Firm became an issue when Mr. Tucker threatened to sue Madison Guaranty for recision of contract, based on the fact that "a utility, subject to regulation by the Public Service Commission, is prohibited from mortgaging utility property without permission of the Public Service Commission."613  This threat would have directly called into question the legal work performed by the First Lady and the Rose Law Firm.

<P>Mr. Tucker refused to rescind his purchase contract for Industrial Services Corporation unless legislation was enacted barring the Public Service Commission from regulating Castle Sewer and Water's rates.614  On February 24, 1987, Mr. Tucker wrote a memorandum to Representative Mike Wilson outlining a proposed bill, a copy of which was attached to the memorandum.615  This proposal, House Bill 1780, passed both houses of the State legislature without a single dissenting vote.616  

<P>Governor Clinton, however, vetoed the bill. According to the Governor's Chief Counsel, Samuel Bratton, Governor Clinton vetoed the bill because it was local and specific and this violated the Arkansas constitution.617  Prior to the veto, the Governor was not aware that the legislation was designed to help Madison Financial, Mr. Tucker, Mr. Randolph, and tangentially The Rose Law Firm and Mrs. Clinton.618

<P>In early April 1987, Mr. Randolph spoke with Mr. Bratton about a way to reverse the Governor's the veto of House Bill 1780.619  Unable to resolve the matter, Mr. Randolph went to see the Governor.620  

<P>On April 14, 1987, because the Governor was unavailable, Mr. Randolph left a message with621 Nancy Hernreich, the Governor's scheduler.622  The message indicated that Mr. Randolph had spoken with the Governor the previous Sunday, and that he wanted to know if the water bill veto was going to stand.623  Mr. Randolph advised Ms. Hernreich that the Governor should call Mr. Tucker about the legislation.  Ms. Hernreich's message indicates that Mr. Randolph "mentioned a meeting between you [Governor Clinton], Tucker, and Jim McDougal a couple of years ago which involved $33,000."624  

<P> The evidence indicates that Mr. Randolph was referring to the April 4, 1985 fundraiser at Madison Guaranty.  This "meeting" involving $33,000 appears to be the 1985 fundraiser.  Mr. Randolph, Mr. Tucker and Mr. McDougal contributed at the April 5, 1985 fundraiser,625 which was almost exactly "a couple of years" before Mr. Randolph's visit to the mansion.  Also, $33,000 is approximately what was raised at the event.  

<P>Ms. Wright, Governor Clinton's Chief of Staff, read the memorandum, and wrote, "see if Sam Bratton will call him."626  The Governor wrote "ugh" in response.

<P>Mr. Tucker wrote a letter to Governor Clinton requesting that he or the representatives who sponsored the legislation be given the opportunity to speak with the staff person who recommended the veto.627  Mr. Tucker met with or had conversations over the telephone with Mr. Bratton to discuss Castle Sewer's need for a legislative remedy.628  On May 13, 1987, Representative Walker called the Governor's office and left a message "Rep Walker want and appt with BC ASAP.  He wants to bring Jim Guy Tucker and R.D. Randolph."629  Underneath the typed message Governor Clinton wrote "This is B.S. I thought Sam, called J. Guy, did he?  I thought PSC not regulating this project, right?"630  There is no doubt that the Governor was aware of the problems his veto created for Castle Sewer.

<P>On May 19, 1987, Mr. Bratton prepared a memorandum to Governor Clinton related to "Sewer District legislation/Jim Guy Tucker-R.D.Randolph, Mike Wilson, Bill Walker."631  The memorandum is revealing about the true nature of the discussions between Mr. Bratton and Mr. Tucker.  The first paragraph contains a discussion of the fact that Madison Guaranty could not legally own and operate a utility, and this limitation was the reason the S&L sold it.632  In addition, the first paragraph mentions that the problem stems from the fact that a utility regulated by the Public Service Commission was barred from mortgaging utility property without permission of the Public Service Commission.  Therefore, in Mr. Tucker's opinion, the mortgage was invalid because the utility had not obtained approval of the mortgage.633  The entire first paragraph mentions nothing about legislation remedying the cost of the Public Service Commission regulation or the burdens that such regulation places on small utilities.

<P>It was Mr. Bratton's position that Representative Walker was interested in seeing the legislation passed because it could save money for the citizens of the City of Wrightsville.634  Mr. Tucker informed Mr. Bratton that if the legislation were not passed that litigation "would result because of the question of the validity of the mortgage and the fact that the S&L is now being operated under the close scrutiny of FSLIC and is no longer controlled by McDougal, et. al."635  Thus, there was a threat of a lawsuit involving Madison Guaranty calling into question the legal work performed by the Rose Law Firm because the mortgage was invalid.636  In none of these subsequent paragraphs is there any mention of the merit of the legislation.

<P>In the last paragraph, Mr. Bratton indicated that he spoke with Robert Johnston, at the Public Service Commission and asked Mr. Johnston to review options available to solve the "Tucker/Randolph problem short of the deregulation proposed by H.B. 1780."637  

<P>On June 12, 1987, Act 37 of 1987 was enacted into law.638  Act 37 of 1987 divests the Public Service Commission of regulatory authority over small sewer and water companies.639  Interestingly, six days after the legislation was signed, Castle Sewer indicated to Madison Guaranty that they were prepared to enter into a new contract.640  

<P>D.<P>Clinton Promises to McDougal on Brewery Legislation

<P>Mr. McDougal consistently turned to Governor Clinton and Mrs. Clinton when he faced state regulatory obstacles involving his land development projects. 

<P>McDougal had many creative ideas for developing real estate.  At Castle Grande, he proposed to build a brewery with a tasting room641 that he hoped would become a profitable local tourist attraction.642  Mr. McDougal spoke with William Lyon, an Arkansas developer, who had borrowed $300,000 from Madison Guaranty.643  Mr. Lyon had already invested the money he borrowed from Madison Guaranty in a brewery in Little Rock.644  At that time, Mr. Lyon was interested in expanding his existing brewery so he could serve and sell alcohol on the same premises.645  However, existing Arkansas state law prohibited the sale of alcohol at a manufacturing facility. 

<P>Mr. Lyon and Mr. McDougal discussed the potential for success of a "brew pub" and the need to change the current state law in order to implement this plan.  Mr. Lyon testified that he discussed the change in the law with Mr. McDougal because he knew Mr. McDougal had "clout" with then-Governor Clinton.646  Mr. Lyon believed that "Jim McDougal thought that he owned Bill Clinton."647  

<P>Indeed, Mr. McDougal assured Mr. Lyon that he would be able to take care of the regulatory problems that prevented Mr. Lyon from building a brew-pub. Mr. McDougal intended to rely on his contacts in the state government, and particularly his friendship with Bill Clinton.648

<P>On December 12, 1984, Mr. McDougal wrote a letter to Betsey Wright, Governor Clinton's chief of staff, about a bill that had been pre-filed with the Arkansas State Senate.  The letter states: "Governor Clinton has made a commitment concerning this bill which I need to discuss with you at your convenience."649  The bill provided exactly the type of legislative relief necessary for Mr. Lyon to successfully build his brew-pub.650<P><P>  On February 18, 1985, the state senator sponsoring the bill withdrew it due to lack of support from the ABC Board.651 Mr. McDougal assured Mr. Lyon, however, that he could have the alcohol regulation changed instead through the ABC Board.652  

<P>Two days later, on February 20, 1985, the ABC Board enacted a regulation that permitted the tasting of alcohol on the premises of a manufacturing facility.653  As promised, Mr. McDougal was able to provide the necessary changes in the state regulations. 

<P>Later that year, Mr. Lyon and Mr. McDougal discussed the prospect of moving Mr. Lyon's brewery to Castle Grande and placing it in a building that was already on the Castle Grande property.654  Unfortunately, Castle Grande was located in a "dry" township and another change in the Arkansas state law or regulations was needed in order to open a brew-pub on the property.  Mr. McDougal again told Mr. Lyon know that he would "take care" of the necessary regulatory changes.655  In a letter dated November 20, 1985, Mr. McDougal informed Seth Ward, who was involved in Mr. McDougal's Castle Grande development, that Governor Clinton would help obtain approval for the brewery.  Mr. McDougal wrote: "I have spoken with the Governor [Clinton] on this matter and expect it will be approved."656

<P> Shortly thereafter, Mr. McDougal enlisted Mrs. Clinton's assistance in performing some legal analysis on the "wet/dry" issue.  In a January 3, 1986 memorandum from Rick Donovan, a Rose Law Firm associate, to Mrs. Clinton,657 Mr. Donovan confirmed that Castle Grande was in a "dry" township.  The memorandum reported that the only way to change the "dry" status was to pass a referendum in the township, or to seek a regulatory change through the ABC Board.  This memorandum was followed by an undated handwritten note from Hillary Clinton.  The note states:

<P>          "Rick -<BR>

               I visited with Seth Ward and gave him a copy of your memo and with Ken Shemin.  Please see Ken about a strategy to approach the ABC to argue the "dissolved township" theory.<BR></P>



<P>                                   Thanks,<BR>

                                   Hillary658<BR></P>

<P>Mr. Ward passed the January 3 memorandum on to Mr. McDougal. The Rose Law Firm billing records mysteriously discovered in the White House Residence indicate that Hillary Clinton billed for a "conference with Mr. Ward and Mr. Shemin" on January 7, 1996, and charged it to the Madison/IDC matter number.659  Mr. Donovan continued to research the wet/dry issue, writing a second memorandum to Mrs. Clinton January 23, 1986.  In his second memo, Mr. Donovan again concluded that without a regulatory change or a vote, the Castle Grande property would still be considered "dry."660   On February 7, 1986, Mr. McDougal wrote a memo to Jim Guy Tucker, "It looks like our township is dry.  Attached is a legal opinion Seth got from his attorney."  The legal opinion attached is Mr. Donovan's January 3rd memorandum.

<P>  At the end of February, the federal S&L examiners arrived at Madison Guaranty, and Mr. McDougal was removed from the S&L before his plans for the brewery could be successfully completed.  

<P>E.<P>McDougal Asks Governor Clinton to Fire Tough State Regulators  



<P>Mr. McDougal asked Governor Clinton for assistance related to Madison and his real estate projects.  For example, after Mr. McDougal received unfavorable treatment from Health Department officials monitoring Maple Creek Farms Land Development,  Governor Clinton's assistance directly resulted in the removal of the state employees regulating the project.    

<P>Maple Creek Farms was one of Mr. McDougal's real estate projects that he intended to subdivide into single-family lots.  On June 23, 1983, however, shortly after McDougal had purchased Maple Creek Farms, Lex Dobbins, a Saline County Health Unit Sanitarian, wrote to Mr. McDougal warning about the instability of the soils and the inadequate absorption fields.661  Mr. Dobbins suggested that "individual sewage disposal permit[s] be obtained prior to any construction," in order to ensure the safety of the sewage system.662  As a result, Mr. McDougal signed a "Memorandum of Agreement"  pledging that each lot would be individually evaluated and approved for a septic tank system and that the lots would not be less than 3 acres in size.663<P>  Without obtaining the permits required by the Memorandum of Agreement, Mr. McDougal began construction on Maple Creek Farms in February of 1984.  Mr. Dobbins reminded him of the need for the proper permits and maintaining lots of at least 3 acres in size664 and again urged Mr. McDougal to consider installing a community sewer system instead of septic tanks.665 

<P>Mr. McDougal wrote to Mr. Dobbins on March 6, 1984, assuring him that the customers would contact the Health Department before beginning construction and that the community sewer system would be available to any lot where a septic system failed.666   On April 26, 1984, Mr. McDougal signed another agreement with the Health Department, which stated, "The Department of Health agrees to issue temporary permits with a condition that property owner shall connect to the sewerage system when said system is available."667

<P>After seeing no significant improvement in the situation at Maple Creek Farms, Mr. Dobbins wrote to his supervisor, William Teer, Director of Sanitarian Services, of the problems.668  In response to Mr. Dobbins' memorandum, Mr. Teer wrote to Mr. McDougal on July 3, 1984, instructing him to correct the problems.669  Two weeks later, Mr. McDougal wrote back stating: "We are in agreement on your recommendations as to site protection and site drainage and are in the process of the continued implementation of these recommendations."670   

<P>Despite Mr. McDougal's assurances that the problems at Maple Creek would be alleviated, the situation was not.  On July 2, 1985, one year later, Mr. Teer informed Mr. McDougal that, absent corrective action, the Department of Health would not issue additional temporary individual sewage disposal permits in the poorly drained areas.671  Contrary to the agreements he had signed and letters he had written promising to correct the sewage problems on Maple Creek Farms, Mr. McDougal continued to ignore the warnings of the Health Department.

<P>By January 1986, Mr. McDougal was so frustrated by the persistent reprimands from the Health Department that he met with Governor Clinton.  Mr. McDougal provided Governor Clinton with a list of detailed grievances that he had with health regulators.672  Governor Clinton granted a meeting with Mr. McDougal and called Mr. Butler in order to summon the state workers as well.673  Mr. Butler recalled Governor Clinton telling him during the call: "the reason I think some of your staff is messing with this development is because this gentlemen [McDougal] has been a supporter of mine since I ran for Congress and has never asked me for anything."674  

<P>On March 4, 1986, Dr. Saltzman, Director of the Health Department, Jerry Hill, Environmental Chief of the Health Department, Janice Choate, an aide to Governor Clinton, Mr. Butler, Mr. McDougal and the Governor met in Governor Clinton's office.675  As a result of this meeting, Mr. Butler removed the three sanitation workers from their positions regulating Maple Creek.  A memorandum from Ms. Choate informed the Governor of this action and noted: "I believe they took their cue from you when you told them that Jim was your friend of 20 years who had never asked for a favor."676

<P>No witnesses denied that Governor Clinton "ordered" the firing of the sanitation workers,677 and the documentary evidence indicates that the termination decisions were made in response to the Governor's wishes.

<P>F.<P>McDougal Helps Select S&L Regulators

<P>In addition to obtaining the removal of state health regulators, Mr. McDougal was able to select some of the state regulators charged with overseeing Madison Guaranty.  The evidence indicates that Governor Clinton looked to Mr. McDougal to provide him with the names of appointees for banking board positions.  A handwritten memo about appointments on Governor's Office stationary reads, "Banking Board - ask McDougal."678

<P>In fact, the Governor's staff contacted Mr. McDougal for his recommendations for the State Savings and Loan Board.679  On February 7, 1985, Mr. McDougal wrote a memorandum to Governor Clinton recommending that John Latham, Chairman of Madison Guaranty, and Jerry Kendall be appointed to the Savings and Loan Board.680  A memorandum announcing Governor Clinton's appointments on March 4, 1985 reflected that Mr. Latham and Dr. Kendall were named to the Savings and Loan Board.681   Mr. McDougal had an obvious interest in having his own employee, Mr. Latham, appointed to a board that would have direct regulatory control over Madison Guaranty.  

<P>Indeed, the evidence indicates that, with then-Governor Clinton's assistance, Mr. McDougal consistently pushed through the appointments of persons who would be favorable to him and Madison Guaranty.  This pattern is demonstrated by the troubling case of William Lyon, an Arkansas developer and business associate of Mr. McDougal.  Mr. Lyon testified that: "Mr. McDougal called me, literally out of the blue, and asked if I would be on the Arkansas State Bank Board."682   Mr. McDougal informed Mr. Lyon that he could get then-Governor Clinton to appoint Mr. Lyon, "and he did."683

<P>During Mr. Lyon's term, however, Mr. McDougal informed him that it "would be more beneficial" if he sat on a different board - the Savings and Loan Board - which would be voting on whether Madison Guaranty could issue preferred stock in order to raise capital.684   Mr. McDougal made it clear to Mr. Lyon that the Governor would support Mr. McDougal in his effort to have the preferred stock issue passed.685  

<P>Mr. McDougal told Mr. Lyon that if he did not agree to serve on the Savings and Loan Board he would be asked to resign from the Bank Board.686  Mr. Lyon believed the preferred stock deal was "a rip-off of the stockholders" and told Mr. McDougal the he would not go over to the Savings and Loan Board.687  Ultimately, Mr. Lyon rejected Mr. McDougal's offer to move to the Savings and Loan Board because he did not want anyone controlling his vote.688

<P>Mr. McDougal asked Mr. Lyon to resign but Mr. Lyon "told him that he no longer had anything to do with the State of Arkansas" and therefore only the Governor could ask him to resign.689  Mr. McDougal then informed Mr. Lyon that he would ask Governor Clinton to ask Mr. Lyon to resign.  Perhaps not coincidentally, Governor Clinton called Mr. Lyon a month or so later and told Mr. Lyon that he had spoken with Mr. McDougal, and that the Governor wanted Mr. Lyon to resign.690  Mr. Lyon resigned from the State Bank Board in February 1984.691 

<P>Documents indicate that later that year, Mr. McDougal played a role in the appointment of the Arkansas Securities Commissioner, Beverly Bassett Schaffer, who ultimately did approve Mr. McDougal's proposal for preferred stock.   Woody Bassett, Ms. Schaffer's brother, wrote to the Governor several times recommending her for the position of Securities Commissioner, however, on a letter dated November 26, 1984, Governor Clinton wrote: "she'd be good but may need to do something else - B."692  After a December 22, 1984, message for the Governor from Mr. McDougal, however, in which he recommended Ms. Schaffer for the position of Securities Commissioner,693  Governor Clinton appointed Ms. Schaffer to the position of directly overseeing Madison Guaranty. 

<P>G.<P>McDougal Hires Mrs. Clinton and Her Law Firm

<P><P>1.<P>The Questionable Retention of the Rose Law Firm

<P>Perhaps as a favor to then-Governor Clinton and Mrs. Clinton, and in an effort to obtain a favorable state regulatory ruling from Ms. Schaffer, in April 1985, Mr. McDougal retained Mrs. Clinton and the Rose Law Firm to represent Madison Guaranty in its proposal for the issuance of preferred stock.  

<P>Mrs. Clinton has provided several versions of how the Rose Law Firm came to be retained by Madison Guaranty contradicted both her own statements and those of others.  Mr. McDougal made statements during the 1992 Clinton Presidential campaign and to the press in 1993 that he put Mrs. Clinton on retainer as a favor to Bill Clinton.  In 1992, Mr. McDougal told James Blair, a longtime Clinton friend and legal advisor to the campaign, and Loretta Lynch, a campaign lawyer who worked on the Whitewater-Madison matters, that Governor Clinton, in jogging pants, visited Mr. McDougal's office and told him that he and Mrs. Clinton were pressed for money and asked Mr. McDougal to give some work to Mrs. Clinton.694  According to Mr. McDougal, two hours later, Mrs. Clinton came by to set up the retainer.695 According to notes taken by Mr. Blair, Mr. McDougal said that he remembered the encounter "explicitly" because Governor Clinton, in his exercise clothes, left a permanent stain on Mr. McDougal's "new leather contour chair."696  In 1993, Mr. McDougal gave a similar account of the incident to the Los Angeles Times.  President Clinton does not recall asking Mr. McDougal to place Mrs. Clinton on retainer.697

<P>Mrs. Clinton has given a markedly different account of the circumstances surrounding Madison Guaranty's retention of the Rose Law Firm.  According to Mrs. Clinton, Richard Massey, then a first year associate at the Rose Law Firm, brought in Madison Guaranty as a client.  Mrs. Clinton claims that although she was the Madison Guaranty billing partner on the matter, she was merely acting as a "backstop" because the firm did not permit associates to bill clients directly.698

<P>During a press conference on April 22, 1994, Mrs. Clinton stated that Mr. Latham, Chief Executive Officer of Madison Guaranty, asked Mr. Massey whether he would be interested in representing Madison in connection with a proposed stock offering.  Mrs. Clinton further explained that Mr. Massey was aware that she knew Mr. McDougal, so "he came to me and asked if I would talk with Jim to see whether or not Jim would let the lawyer and the officer go forward on this project.  I did that, and I arranged that the firm would be paid $2,000 retainer."699  In a statement to the RTC in November 1994, Mrs. Clinton similarly told investigators that "she recalled Massey came to her and asked her to be the billing attorney which was a normal practice when an associate was handling the matter. . . Mrs. Clinton recalled that a Madison official (individual unknown) approached Rick Massey regarding a preferred stock offering in an effort to raise capital."

<P> In a sworn response to an RTC interrogatory in May 1995, Mrs. Clinton elaborated on her story.  Mrs. Clinton stated that Mr. Massey approached her because "certain lawyers" in the Rose Law Firm were "opposed" to representing Mr. McDougal until Mr. McDougal paid an outstanding bill, and he was aware that Mrs. Clinton knew Mr. McDougal.  Mrs. Clinton wrote:

<P>In the spring of 1985, Massey came to see me because he had learned that certain lawyers at the firm were opposed to doing any more work for Jim McDougal or any of his companies until he paid his bill and then only if Madison Guaranty agreed to prepay a certain sum. . . I believe Massey approached me about presenting this proposal to Jim McDougal because he was aware that I knew him.700

<P>Mr. Massey, however, contradicts Mrs. Clinton's account in sworn testimony before the Special Committee.  According to Mr. Massey, he was not responsible for bringing in Madison as a client.701  Mr. Massey stated specifically18  that Mr. Latham never offered him Madison's business,702 and that he did not recall approaching Mrs. Clinton with a proposal to represent Madison.703  Contrary to Mrs. Clinton's unsworn statement of November 1994 to the RTC, Mr. Massey also indicated that he did not ask Mrs. Clinton to be the billing attorney.704

<P>David Knight, a former Rose partner specializing in securities law, testified that he attended the lunch meeting during which, according to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Latham allegedly hired Mr. Massey.705  Mr. Knight confirmed Mr. Massey's testimony that Mr. Latham did not ask Mr. Massey to represent Madison on the preferred stock offering.  Quite to the contrary, according to Mr. Knight, the subject of the stock offering never arose.706  Indeed, according to Mr. Knight, Mr. Latham informed him and Mr. Massey at the lunch that Mr. McDougal made all hiring decisions and that Madison Guaranty already had outside counsel.707

<P>Mr. Latham confirmed that Mr. McDougal made the decision19  to retain the Rose Law Firm.708  

<P>The essence of Mrs. Clinton's account of the Madison retainer was that she became involved due to an alleged outstanding debt that Mr. McDougal's Madison Bank & Trust owed to the Rose Law Firm in 1985.  Mrs. Clinton claimed that it was to relieve the concerns of her partners that she insisted on the $2000 per month retainer.  

<P>Documentary evidence and testimony provided to the Special Committee, however, indicate that the outstanding balance of Rose's bill to Madison Bank & Trust was paid in November 1984, months prior to Mrs. Clinton's retainer in April 1985. 

<P>Gary Bunch, President of Madison Bank & Trust, produced documents evidencing the bank's payment of the Rose legal fees in late October of 1984.  Minutes of Madison Bank for October 1984 indicate that $5,000 in legal fees are owed to the Rose Law Firm for work on the "Huntsville move appeal,"709 litigation relating to the relocation of the bank.  The minutes state: "Mr. McDougal seconded that Mr. Bunch will negotiate settlement with the firm."710  Mr. Bunch testified that Mr. McDougal directed him to pay the outstanding Rose Law Firm bill for the Madison Bank & Trust matter in full in October 1984.711 

<P>Following the discovery of the Rose billing records and the testimony of Mr. Massey before the Special Committee, Mrs. Clinton's story changed in a February 1996 interview with RTC investigators.20   Mrs. Clinton claimed the late Vincent Foster first informed her that Mr. Massey wanted to do work for Madison: "I believe it was Vince Foster who came to me, who said that Mr. Massey wanted to do this work, but the partners didn't want him to do it."712  When asked who suggested that she approach Mr. McDougal, Mrs. Clinton replied, "I don't have a specific recollection.  I believe it was Vince Foster, but I'm not positive."713

<P><P>2.<P>Mrs. Clinton Asks the Arkansas S&L Regulator to Approve a Novel Stock Issue

<P><P>The Rose Law Firm billing records belatedly discovered in the White House Residence show that Mrs. Clinton called Ms. Schaffer the day before the Rose Law Firm submitted to the Arkansas Securities Department Madison's proposal to offer preferred stock in order to raise badly need capital.714  Ms. Schaffer notified Mrs. Clinton of the approval of the proposal two weeks later in a letter addressed to "Dear Hillary."  Ms. Schaffer and Mrs. Clinton both denied that Madison was given any preferential treatment.715

<P>Prior to the discovery of the billing records, Mrs. Clinton claimed in her sworn responses to RTC interrogatories in May 1995 that she called the Arkansas Securities Department to find out "to whom Mr. Massey should direct any inquiries" but she did not recall to whom she spoke.716

<P>In testimony before the Special Committee, Ms. Schaffer directly contradicted Mrs. Clinton and stated that the proposal was discussed during the phone call.  According to Ms. Schaffer,  She called and said they had a proposal, and what it was about; and I said I'm familiar with that; I've already looked at that.  You know, I agree with the-basically I have no problem with that position, and you'll be getting a letter soon to that effect.. . I think in substance I said, basically,I agree with the position-I mean, that preferred stock can be issued pursuant to the Business Corporation Code.717 



<P>Mr. Massey likewise contradicted Mrs. Clinton's account of the phone call.  Mr. Massey testified that he drafted the proposal and knew exactly to whom the proposal should be sent.718  Mr. Massey also said that Mrs. Clinton never gave any instructions about addressing the transmittal letter.719  Mr. Massey did not recall asking Mrs. Clinton to make such an inquiry and was not aware that she had.720



<P>Prior to the Rose Law Firm's engagement of Madison, the law firm, Mitchell, Williams, Selig, Jackson & Tucker started to perform research related to a preferred stock proposal.721  The firm even opened a file labelled "Madison Guaranty - Sale of Stock" on February 6, 1985.722  For some reason, then, Mr. McDougal decided to send the work to the Rose Law Firm.

<P>On April 30, 1985, The Rose Law Firm wrote a letter to Charles Handley, Assistant to the Arkansas Securities Commissioner.21  to request an opinion as to whether Madison Guaranty was authorized to issue nonvoting preferred stock.723   Mr. Massey drafted the letter.724  This was the first time the Arkansas Securities Department was asked to make a determination on the ability of a savings and loan to issue preferred stock.725  After receiving the letter from the Rose Law Firm, Mr. Handley, an accountant, wrote, in a routing memorandum on May 6, 1985, that "perhaps one of our attorneys should review the matter and issue a legal opinion."726  Ms. Schaffer forwarded a copy to William Brady, who was the only staff attorney at the Arkansas Securities Department.727  Attached to the letter was a memorandum from Ms. Schaffer which said "Brady: Please review and draft reply to Hillary 6 May 1985."728  It was Mr. Brady's understanding that this was to be an approval letter.729  Therefore, any review was merely to get an understanding of the issues, because he believed it had already been determined that the proposal would be approved.  

<P>Mr. Brady did not draft a reply. Instead he drafted a memorandum to Ms. Schaffer explaining his objection to the plan.730  "The more I looked into the Rose Law Firm request concerning the issuance of preferred stock ... the less I supported the position presented in the Rose Law Firm."731   Because the plan had never been done in Arkansas before, Mr. Brady disagreed with the Rose Law Firm analysis: "I was not sure it was permissible."732  Mr. Brady believed the Arkansas Securities Commission should seek an opinion from the Arkansas Attorney General.733  

<P>Mr. Handley was also concerned about the right of Arkansas savings and loan associations to issue preferred stock.  Mr. Handley testified that after receiving the Rose Law Firm's letter his "initial belief was that Madison guaranty could not issue preferred stock because under the Arkansas State Savings and Loan Act, state institutions could only issue common stock."734  Mr. Handley relented after his supervisor, Ms. Jones, disagreed.735 

<P>On May 14, 1985, just two weeks after receiving this unique proposal, and despite the objections of her staff attorney, Ms. Schaffer approved the Rose Law Firm's position that Madison Guaranty could issue preferred stock.736   

<P>Over the course of the next seven months, the Rose Law Firm continued to prepare the documents for a preferred stock offering.737   Madison Guaranty, however, had lost interest in issuing preferred stock.  Instead, Madison tried to and raise capital through property syndication and a proposed offering22  of subordinated debt.    

III.<P>The Castle Grande Land Deal: A Series of Fraudulent Loans

<P>The land development commonly known as "Castle Grande" consisted of about 1,050 acres of property near Little Rock.  Madison Guaranty's wholly-owned subsidiary, Madison Financial Corporation, and Seth Ward, Webster Hubbell's father-in-law, jointly purchased the property for $1.7 million and then sold the land in parcels to various Madison insiders.738  Almost all of the sales were financed by loans from Madison Guaranty, and most of the loans were not repaid.  As a consequence, the Castle Grande deal caused nearly $4 million in losses to Madison Guaranty.739  These losses were borne ultimately by U.S. taxpayers.

<P>Numerous transactions related to Castle Grande were fraudulent, criminal, or both.  Indeed, the recent convictions of Mr. McDougal, Mrs. McDougal, and Governor Jim Guy Tucker on criminal fraud and conspiracy charges stemmed in part from certain aspects of the Castle Grande deal.  

<P>Under this sham transaction, Mr. Ward purchased 60% of the available land -- with 100% nonrecourse financing by Madison Guaranty -- and Madison Financial had the right to buy the property from him once it had found other buyers.  The inclusion of Mr. Ward in the deal was intended to, and had the effect of, circumventing an Arkansas regulation that limited investment in a service corporation such as MFC by a savings and loan.  In essence, Mr. Ward was nothing more than as "straw man" who held the property in his name for Madison Financial because Madison could not own it all.  As compensation for his role, Mr. Ward earned hundreds of thousands of dollars in commissions on the sale of the Castle Grande property.<P><P>

<P>New evidence indicates that Mrs. Clinton played a direct role in transactions involving Castle Grande and has never admitted the extent of her role.  The billing records discovered in the White House Residence in January 1996 indicate that between late 1985 and early 1986 Mrs. Clinton had numerous conferences with Mr. Ward about the matter and billed Madison for approximately 30 hours of work related to Castle Grande.740  Of importance, the billing records indicate that Mrs. Clinton drafted an option agreement dated May 1, 1986, between Mr. Ward and Madison.  Mrs. Clinton drafted this option at a time when Madison Guaranty was intense scrutiny from federal regulators.  According to James Clark, the chief examiner of the 1986 Federal Home Loan Bank Board examination of Madison Guaranty, the May 1 option "was created in order to conceal" the true purpose of questionable notes executed between Seth Ward, Madison Guaranty, and Madison Financial.741  

<P>The use to which Mrs. Clinton's work product was put raises questions about the state of her knowledge concerning what was going on at Madison Guaranty.  The Special Committee has identified one occasion where Mrs. Clinton was apparently put on notice of suspect loans related to Castle Grande.  When Madison Guaranty's top lending official, Don Denton, expressed concerns to Mrs. Clinton about questionable notes involving Seth Ward, she "summarily dismissed" his concerns.742  Mr. Denton gathered from her response that she was saying he should "take care of savings and loan matters and she would take care of legal matters."743

<P>Furthermore, the Rose Law Firm billing records indicate that Mrs. Clinton had spent time studying a letter prepared by the Rose Law Firm explaining why the Ward notes were questionable -- i.e., the rule limiting direct investment by a savings and loan in real estate ventures.  Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that Mrs. Clinton was apprised of both the law and the facts that made Castle Grande an illegal transaction.

<P>In the view of the Special Committee, Mrs. Clinton's role in the Castle Grande deal cannot be assessed in isolation from her reluctance to be forthcoming about the extent of that role.  Mrs. Clinton's role in the Castle Grande transactions was all but unknown prior to the discovery of her billing records in the White House residence in January 1996.  Indeed, in a sworn interrogatory given to the RTC in May 1995, Mrs. Clinton represented that she knew nothing about Castle Grande.744  In light of the billing records and other evidence, the Committee finds that Mrs. Clinton's representation is difficult to credit.

<P>A.<P>Structuring of the Acquisition of the Castle Grande Property to Evade State Regulations

<P> Mr. Ward and Madison Financial purchased the Castle Grande together in fall 1985 from Industrial Development Company of Little Rock ("IDC") for $1.75 million.745  Mr. Ward, who was working as a part-time consultant for Madison Financial, brought the possible purchase of this property to Mr. McDougal's attention.746  On September 13, 1985, Madison Financial and IDC entered into a purchase agreement, which Mr. Ward signed on behalf of Madison Guaranty.747  The closing was held on October 4, 1985.748  

<P>At an early stage, Rose Law Firm attorneys were involved in the deal.  Rose partner Thomas Thrash was involved in the acquisition of the IDC property for Madison Financial and attended the closing, although he has no recollection of it.749  In addition, the Rose Law Firm billing records reflect that, on November 14, 1985, Mrs. Clinton had a "conference with Seth Ward regarding purchase from [IDC Chairman] Brick Lile."750 

<P>Although some aspects of the deal struck by Mr. Ward and Madison Financial are disputed, the following is not in doubt.  Madison Financial purchased the property south of 145th Street -- about 40% of the total land area -- plus some other parcels for $600,000.751  Mr. Ward purchased most of the land north of 145th Street, plus the property's sewer and water utility, for $1.15 million.752  The entire purchase was financed by Madison Guaranty, which loaned Mr. Ward the $1.15 million on a nonrecourse basis.753

<P>  Madison Financial and Mr. Ward agreed that the property would be parceled, developed, and sold as quickly as possible; that proceeds from sales would be applied toward the mortgage on the property; and that Mr. Ward would receive a commission on any sale, whether the land belonged to him or Madison Financial.754  Finally, Madison Financial had the right to purchase all or some of Mr. Ward's property from him.755



<P>B.<P>The Fraudulent Nature of the Castle Grande Purchase

<P>The purchase of the Castle Grande property by Madison Financial and Seth Ward has been described by federal regulators as a fraudulent transaction.  In essence, Mr. Ward warehoused the property to allow Madison Guaranty to evade regulatory limitations upon its investment in real estate.

<P>Under Section V of the Rules and Regulations of the Arkansas Savings and Loan Association Board, Arkansas thrifts may establish service corporations to pursue real estate development ventures.756  Madison Financial Corporation, Madison Guaranty's wholly-owned subsidiary, was such a service corporation.

<P>Section V(C), however, limits a savings and loan's investment in its service corporation to 6% of the thrift's assets.  This rule is known as the 6% rule or the direct investment rule.  Section V(C) provides:

<P>An association may make any investment under this section if its aggregate outstanding investment in the capital stock, obligations, or other securities of service corporations and subsidiaries thereof . . . would not exceed thereupon six (6%) percent of the association's assets.757



<P>According to James Clark, the Examiner-in-Charge of the 1986 Federal Home Loan Bank Board ("FHLBB") examination of Madison Guaranty,758 the purpose of the direct investment rule was "[t]o limit the amount of risk that Madison Guaranty or any Arkansas thrift could take.  Direct investments in service corporations or in property are considered to be more risky than just lending on property."759

<P>The FHLBB's May 8, 1986 examination report on Madison Guaranty sharply criticized the purchase of Castle Grande as having been structured to circumvent the direct investment rule:

<P>Ward apparently warehoused this land to reduce Madison Financial's investment and the attendant borrowing from Madison Guaranty.  In this way, limitations on Madison Guaranty's investment in its Service Corporation are avoided. . . . By using this circuitous route, additional Madison Guaranty investment in Madison Financial was disguised as a loan to Ward.760



<P>In a recent interview with the FDIC's Office of Inspector General, Mr. Clark stressed that "had MGSL purchased Castle Grande directly, they would have exceeded their direct investment limit."761  In hearings before the Special Committee, Mr. Clark expressed the view that Mr. Ward was a "straw purchaser,"762 or someone "who obtains legal title to a property without having any actual financial interest in the property simply as a means to hide the true ownership of the property."763  Mr. Clark also explained that as a federal examiner he was concerned about the state direct investment rule because "internal FHLBB procedures called on an institution to be in compliance with state regulations" and "violating the state regulation would mean that the institution was not operating safely and soundly."764

<P> Others have confirmed that the purchase of Castle Grande was structured to evade the direct investment rule.  Don Denton, Madison Guaranty's Chief Lending Officer, testified in the McDougal trial that "[t]here was a limitation on the amount of investment that Madison Financial Corp. could make, so Madison took the amount it could legally take and the balance of the acquisition was taken by Seth Ward."765  And in a recent interview, Mr. Denton "said that it was his understanding that Ward was acting as a 'nominee' purchaser in the acquisition of the IDC property, acting on behalf of the institution and carrying the property at no risk."766  In a deposition taken in connection with the Ward v. Madison case, Madison Guaranty's CEO, John Latham testified that the purchase was divided between Madison Financial and Mr. Ward to escape the direct investment rule.767



<P>  In sum, the Special Committee finds that substantial evidence demonstrates that the purchase of the Castle Grande property was a fraudulent transaction that violated the direct investment rule and involved the use of Mr. Ward as straw man.23<P>   Mr. Ward testified to the Special Committee that he had no knowledge of the limitation on direct investment at the time of the Castle Grande purchase or that limitation dictated the structure of the transaction.768  That testimony, however, is contrary to a statement that Mr. Ward made to investigators working for the Pillsbury law firm.  An April 29, 1994 interview reflects that "Ward indicated with respect to Castle Grand [sic] that he understood when he purchased the property that the money was being loaned to him and the property purchased in his name because of a limitation on Madison Financial Corporation's investments."769 

<P>Moreover, Webster Hubbell, Mr. Ward's son-in-law -- with whom Mr. Ward talked about business constantly770 -- has stated that he was aware in September 1985 "based on what Mr. Ward told me" was that "Madison had limits on what it could own in its own name, and so Mr. Ward was going to own part of it until it could be sold."771  In another interview, Mr. Hubbell indicated that Mr. Ward may have told him that there was a regulatory limit on what Madison could purchase.772   

<P>Finally, in a December 1986 interview of James McDougal conducted by the Memphis, Tennessee law firm Borod & Huggins (which had been retained as special counsel by Madison Guaranty's Board of Directors), McDougal indicated that "Madison Financial took the property south of 145th Street and Ward took the property north of 145th Street.  This split was done because the entire project would have been beyond the capacity of Madison Financial due to bank board regulations."773  It seems likely that if Mr. McDougal knew about the limiting regulation he communicated this to Mr. Ward.

<P>The sham perpetrated in connection with Castle Grande did not end with the purchase of the property in the fall of 1985.  In subsequent months, the property was sold in a series of transactions.774  In most cases, the property was sold to Madison insiders and friends of the McDougals with 100% Madison financing.  Because many of these loans were not repaid, Madison Guaranty suffered large financial losses.  These losses were passed on to the American taxpayer after the institution's failure.  The RTC estimated that Castle Grande caused losses in excess of $3.8 million.775 

<P>Under his agreement with Madison Financial, Seth Ward reaped sizable commissions on all Castle Grande sales, which ultimately totalled over $300,000.776.  The last of these sales took place in late February 1986, when 486 acres was sold to former Senator J.W. Fulbright for $77,600, and the Castle Grande sewer and water utility was sold to a company owned by Jim Guy Tucker and R.D. Randolph for $1.2 million.777  After these sales, there remained only two parcels, both owned by Mr. Ward.  One of these was tracts 27 and 28 of Holman Acres.778  

<P>According to Don Denton, after February 28, 1986, Ward began to demand his commissions for Castle Grande sales but Madison Guaranty lacked ready funds to pay him.779  It seems likely that an even greater obstacle to the payment of the commissions was the presence of federal savings & loan regulators, who commenced their examination of Madison Guaranty and moved into its offices on or around March 4, 1986.780  Indeed, Mr. Latham testified in the Ward v. Madison trial that the presence of the examiners was a concern in this regard.781

<P>As a result of these difficulties, Madison Guaranty, Madison Financial, and Seth Ward executed a series of notes and loan transactions.  On March 31, 1986, Madison Guaranty loaned $400,000 to Mr. Ward.782  Notably, the loan was secured by the mortgage on the Holman Acres property.  Mr. Ward returned $100,000 within a week or so, leaving him with $300,000.783  Then, on April 7, 1986, MFC gave -- but did not fund -- two promissory notes to Seth Ward, one for $300,000, the other for $70,943.784  

<P>According to Mr. Denton, the exchange of these offsetting notes was intended to pay Mr. Ward his commissions.785  That is, the $400,000 loan (less the $100,000 that was returned) satisfied the commissions and the notes from Madison Financial offset any obligation by Mr. Ward to repay that loan.  Similarly, in the Ward trial, Mr. Ward testified that the $370,943 in notes was intended to document for the regulators his entitlement to commissions.786 24 

<P>In September 1987, after he had a falling out with Mr. McDougal, Mr. Ward filed suit against Madison Guaranty claiming that he was entitled to collect unpaid commissions on the sale of Castle Grande property.787  He was represented in that action by Alston Jennings, a prominent local attorney in the Little Rock law firm of Wright, Lindsey & Jennings.788  

<P>The Ward v. Madison case is significant because the meaning of several documents bearing upon the Castle Grande transaction, including the May 1 option drafted by Mrs. Clinton, was disputed at the trial.  Specifically, Mr. Latham, testifying for the defense, took the position that the option was related to Mr. Ward's unpaid commissions.789  Mr. Ward maintained at the trial that the option had nothing to do with his commissions and claimed that Madison Financial had simply wanted the right to purchase Holman Acres from him.790<P><P> 

<P>The jury returned a verdict in Mr. Ward's favor and awarded him over $391,000.791  In 1993, however, Mr. Ward and the RTC as the successor to Madison Guaranty reached a settlement under which Mr. Ward agreed to pay $325,000 to the RTC in exchange for a release from all liability.792

<P>Prior to the trial, Madison Guaranty had suggested in a document filed with the court that the underlying transactions as to which Mr. Ward claimed an entitlement to commissions were questionable.  Specifically, Madison Guaranty indicated that it might argue that it did not owe any commissions to Mr. Ward because of his own "unclean hands."  By way of explanation, Madison Guaranty stated in its court filing: "With knowledge, the Plaintiff [Mr. Ward] agreed to purchase a section of the Undeveloped Property in his name so that Madison Financial Corporation would not exceed its investment limitation, imposed by the FHLBB, of 6% of the assets of the corporation.  In effect, Plaintiff acted as a straw man for the real estate purchase for the mutual benefit of himself, Jim McDougal and other individuals."  No witness at the trial, however, suggested that Mr. Ward's commissions were ill-gotten and Madison Guaranty's lawyers made no such argument.

 

<P>C.<P>The September 24, 1985 Letters

<P>The essential terms of the initial agreement between Mr. McDougal and Mr. Ward as described above were set forth in a letter dated September 24, 1985 from Seth Ward to Jim McDougal.793  Two versions of this document exist.  According to Seth Ward, one of the letters was typed on September 24, 1985, by Susan Strayhorn, James McDougal's secretary, and the other version was prepared sometime thereafter and then backdated.794  Ms. Strayhorn agreed that she typed the first letter at Mr. Ward's direction.795  Mr. Ward has testified that he had the backdated letter prepared or prepared it himself.796

<P>The major difference between the two versions of the September 24 letter concerns Madison Financial's right to purchase Seth Ward's property.  While the original letter gave Madison Financial the right to purchase all of Mr. Ward's property, the backdated letter excluded from Madison's reach a 22 1/2 acre parcel known as Holman Acres.  A detailed legal description of the 22 1/2 acre parcel -- identified as "Part of Tracts 27 & 28, Holman Acres, Pulaski County, Arkansas" -- was attached as an addendum to the letter.

<P>Although Seth Ward testified that the backdated version of the September 24, 1985 letter was prepared within several weeks or a month of that date,797 there is substantial evidence that it was created much later than that.  Former Madison President John Latham has testified that he had never seen the letter until Mr. Ward brought it to his attention in May or June of 1986.798  Ms. Strayhorn testified that the document was not in the S & L's files, and that she had never seen it before 1987.799  Don Denton, who initially refused to state whether he had any knowledge about the backdating of the letter for fear of "digging a hole for myself," later said that "I'll go so far as to say [it was] drawn after July, 1986."800  And James Clark, lead investigator for the 1986 examination of Madison Guaranty, has stated that he does not recall ever seeing the document during the time he was at the savings and loan.801

<P>D.<P>The May 1 Option Disguises the Questionable Payments to Seth Ward



<P>While Mr. Clark examining Madison Guaranty, Madison insiders did not disclose to him that commissions might be owed to Seth Ward, and Mr. Clark was not aware of this issue until he discovered by chance the original September 24, 1985 letter in a desk drawer.802  The letter was the first indication Mr. Clark had that Seth Ward might be owed commissions.803  

<P>Mr. Clark also saw the March 31 and April 7 notes during the examination and became concerned that there might be a connection between the notes.804  Specifically, his suspicion was that the crossing notes might represent a payment to Mr. Ward and thus constitute "independent financing of MFC by Madison Guaranty"805 Such "independent financing" would raise the concerns underlying the direct investment limitation.806  

<P>When Mr. Clark inquired about the March 31 and April 7 notes, however, he was told that they were unrelated, "completely separate deals."807  Instead, the April 7 notes -- evidencing the $373,000 debt from Madison Financial to Mr. Ward -- were said to be related to a plan by Madison Financial to purchase Holman Acres from Mr. Ward.  The transaction was to be accomplished through an as yet undrafted option agreement which would replace the notes.  The notes, Mr. Clark was told, existed simply to guarantee that Madison Financial would go through with the deal pending preparation of the option and would be canceled after the exercise of the option.808  

<P>According to Mr. Clark, if he had known that the exchange of notes was a device to pay Mr. Ward's commissions -- and thereby transfer money from the savings and loan to its the service corporation -- it would have effected his examination in several respects.  Mr. Clark said "that if he and known about the commissions, at the very least he would have called it a direct investment by Madison Guaranty into MFC because MGSL would be funding MFC's obligations, and he would have been asking what Ward did to earn the commissions."809  He also expressed the view that "the commissions would [have] been a further indication that Ward was a 'straw' buyer in the IDC purchase" and that "if the loan had been made to pay commissions, he would have considered the loan 'deceptive on its face.'"810

<P>An option was prepared on May 1, 1986, and entitled "Option To Purchase Real Estate."25 811  Under the May 1 option -- which was executed by Mr. Ward and Mr. Latham -- Madison Financial had the right to purchase tracts 27 and 28 of Holman Acres from Mr. Ward for $400,000 and Mr. Ward was to be paid $35,000 for extending this option to Madison Financial.812

<P>That Mrs. Clinton was involved in the creation of this option is indisputable.  The Rose Law Firm billing records reflect that on May 1, 1986, Mrs. Clinton billed Madison Guaranty for two hours of time for the following work: "Conference with Seth Ward; telephone conference with Seth Ward regarding option; telephone conference with Mike Shauffle; prepare option."813  Furthermore, there appears in the lower left hand corner of the option a word processing code ("0190g") that, according to the Rose Law Firm's counsel, indicates the document was created at the Rose Law Firm by or for Mrs. Clinton.814  Mrs. Clinton, however, has sworn that she has no recollection of the option agreement or the transaction it reflects.815

<P>According to Mr. Clark, the May 1, 1986 option prepared by Mrs. Clinton was used to disguise the fact that the crossing notes between Seth Ward, Madison Guaranty, and Madison Financial were designed to funnel commissions to Mr. Ward.  He stated that "based upon what he has now learned the option was created 'in order to conceal the connection -- whatever it was-- between'" the notes.816 

<P>When Mrs. Clinton prepared the May 1 option, she may have known about the relationship involving the May 1 option and its use to disguise the fact that Madison Guaranty had paid Mr. Ward's commissions.  A message slip produced by Mr. Denton reflects that Mrs. Clinton called him from the Rose Law Firm on April 7, 1986.817  Mr. Denton returned the call and spoke to Mrs. Clinton.818  The subject of the conversation was the notes between Mr. Ward, Madison Financial, and Madison Guaranty.819  Mr. Denton had the sense that Mrs. Clinton was preparing a $400,000 note involving Madison Financial and Mr. Ward and he told her that such a note had already been prepared and executed.820  Mrs. Clinton asked him to send whatever notes there were to her and Mr. Denton did so, sending copies of the notes by courier.821

<P>Mr. Denton recalled that during the conversation he indicated to Mrs. Clinton that a problem might exist with respect to the Ward notes because "they constituted in effect a parent entity fulfilling the obligation of a subsidiary."822  Mrs. Clinton, however, "summarily dismissed" that concern in a way that he took to mean that "he would take care of savings and loan matters, and she would take care of legal matters." 823

<P>On June 13, 1996, the same day that the Special Committee received Mr. Denton's testimony, the Committee in a letter addressed to Mr. Kendall, Mrs. Clinton's counsel, requested that the First Lady attempt to refresh her recollection regarding the matters discussed by Mr. Denton and inform the Committee of what she recalls about them.824  The Special Committee's request was made in response to an earlier offer by Mrs. Clinton through a White House spokesman to answer in writing questions regarding the subject of the Special Committee's work.

<P>On June 17, 1996 the Special Committee received an affidavit from Mrs. Clinton accompanied by a letter from Mr. Kendall.  In the affidavit, Mrs. Clinton gave no indication as to her recollection regarding the subject matter of Mr. Denton's testimony.  Instead, she simply requested that Special Committee refer to Mr. Kendall's letter "addressing certain allegations recently made by Mr. Don Denton."825  In his letter, Mr. Kendall maintained that Mr. Denton's recollection is "wholly unreliable" but gave no indication as to the recollection of the First Lady.826  In sum, the First Lady has neither confirmed nor denied Mr. Denton's testimony.

<P>E.<P>Mrs. Clinton's Previously Unknown Legal Work for Questionable Castle Grande Transactions



<P>Prior to the discovery of the Rose Law Firm billing records in the White House Residence, the nature and extent of Mrs. Clinton's work on Castle Grande matters was virtually unknown.  Indeed, Patricia Black, former Counsel to the RTC Office of Inspector General, testified in 1995 that "[w]e have no evidence that she [Hillary Clinton] worked on Castle Grande."827  The evidence obtained in the course of the Special Committee's investigation now establishes that Mrs. Clinton had substantial direct involvement in Castle Grande.

<P>From the billing records, the Special Committee learned that, over a seven month period from late 1984 to mid 1985, Mrs. Clinton billed almost 30 hours of time to Castle Grande related matters while representing Madison Guaranty -- more than any other Rose Law Firm attorney;828 that she he had 15 conferences with Seth Ward, the central figure in the transaction -- seven of them occurring within 18 days in December, 1985;829 that she had a telephone conference with Don Denton on April 7, 1986;830 and that she drafted an option agreement between Seth Ward and Madison Financial Corporation on May 1, 1986.831  Because Mrs. Clinton has no recollection of any of these events, however, the Special Committee's understanding was limited.  But just days before the conclusion of its investigation, the Special Committee obtained new evidence illuminating Mrs. Clinton's Castle Grande-related work on April 7 and May 1, 1986.  

<P>From Jim Clark, the FHLBB examiner in charge of the 1986 examination of Madison Guaranty, the Special Committee now knows that the option drafted by Mrs. Clinton, in his view, "was created in order to conceal" a direct investment in Madison Financial through the payment of questionable commissions to Seth Ward.   

<P>From Don Denton, Madison's former chief lending officer, the Special Committee has learned that apparently on April 7 Mrs. Clinton "summarily dismissed" concerns he expressed to her by Mr. Denton about questionable notes involving Seth Ward -- notes she apparently was set to prepare had they not already been drafted.  Mr. Denton understood from Mrs. Clinton's response that she was saying he should "take care of savings and loan matters and she would take care of legal matters."  

<P>The Rose billing records also suggest that Mrs. Clinton learned of the direct investment rule by June 1985.  In a letter dated June 17, 1985, Richard Massey, then a Rose associate working with Mrs. Clinton, wrote a letter to officials of the Arkansas Securities Commission ("ASC") regarding Madison Guaranty's application to engage in brokerage activities.832  The letter was a response to a May 22, 1985 ASC memorandum about the same matter in which the ASC discusses the 6% "assets limitation which is set forth in Rule V(C),"833 i.e., the direct investment rule found in Rule V(C) of the Rules and Regulations of the Arkansas Savings and Loan Association Board ("ASLAB").  Mr. Massey's June 17 letter likewise refers to "the limitation set forth in Rule V(C)."834  It concludes by saying, "[w]ith this response, Madison hereby amends the Application."835  The billing records indicate that on June 17, 1985, Mr. Massey billed time to "draft/revise response to ASLAB application,"836 and Mrs. Clinton billed time to "review applications amendments."837  Mrs. Clinton would have become aware of the direct investment rule through this review of Mr. Massey's letter. 

<P>The use to which Mrs. Clinton's work product was put raises questions about her knowledge of the state of affairs at Madison Guaranty.  The billing records suggest that Mrs. Clinton should have been aware of the rule against excessive direct investments.  Furthermore, from her conversation with Don Denton, Mrs. Clinton apparently was put on notice -- prior to the drafting of the option -- that Mr. Ward was taking part at Madison in transactions that were at least questionable if not fraudulent.  Unless she was engaged in conscious avoidance, Mrs. Clinton should have known these facts when she drafted the May 1 option, which concealed from the regulators the very transactions Mr. Denton warned her about.<P>

<P>In 1995, when asked about her knowledge of Castle Grande and several other land developments, Mrs. Clinton stated, under oath, "I do not believe I knew anything about any of these real estate parcels and projects."838

<P>The billing records, however, revealed that Mrs. Clinton performed a substantial amount of legal work for Madison Guaranty related the Castle Grande property and billed this time to a matter called "I.D.C."  The records indicated, for example, that Mrs. Clinton had more than a dozen conferences with Seth Ward.  Mrs. Clinton's claim that she did not know anything about Castle Grande appears contrary to the billing records.

<P>In response to a set of supplemental interrogatories propounded by the RTC in 1996, Mrs. Clinton sought to explain her prior blanket denial of knowledge of Castle Grande by saying that she thought of the larger property as "IDC" and a small portion of the property as Castle Grande Estates. 

<P>In the RTC's interrogatories which I answer on May 24, 1995, the term "Castle Grande" was not defined, and we construed this reference to be to Castle Grande Estates, a mobile home development which I now understand to be a portion of the 1050-acre tract.  In these responses to the Supplemental Interrogatories, I will refer to the entire tract not as Castle Grande but as the "IDC property", because "IDC" was the billing name for work involving that property at the Rose Law Firm.839

   

<P>Mrs. Clinton's attempt to claim she had misunderstood the name of the project appears contrary to a wealth of evidence to the effect that the entire 1000+ acre tract was known as "Castle Grande."  That is the term by which Madison Guaranty officials and federal regulators commonly referred to the parcel.  

<P>The minutes of a MFC Board of Directors meeting dated September 12, 1985, reflect that the Board discussed the purchase of 400 acres of land on 145th Street for $600,000 and that "[a]fter a lengthy discussion, the Board unanimously approved the purchase of this development to be known as Castle Grande Estates."840  Consistent with these minutes, Don Denton testified at the McDougal trial that the property "was renamed Castle Grande shortly after the acquisition" from IDC.841  At the same trial, Mr. McDougal said that Castle Grande was the name of "about a thousand acres" of property.842  And Susan McDougal, denying any distinction between Castle Grande and IDC, has stated that "[i]t was always the same thing.  As far as I know, IDC and Castle Grande were one and the same."843<P> 

<P>Two former FHLBB examiners who participated in the 1986 examination of Madison and scrutinized the Castle Grande transaction, James Clark and Dawn Pulcer, testified that Madison insiders referred to the whole project as Castle Grande.844

<P>Finally, Davis Fitzhugh, a former Madison Financial Vice President, testified that he understood all of property south of 145th Street to be Castle Grande.845  But Mr. Fitzhugh agreed that the $50,000 check he used to make the down payment on his purchase of the Levi Strauss building -- which is located north of 145th Street -- carried the notation, "For: sale of bldg C Castle Grande."846 

<P>In the summer of 1988, Mrs. Clinton ordered the destruction of her files related to Castle Grande.  A July 21, 1988 memorandum from Mary Russell to Mrs. Clinton reflects that the Rose Law Firm was in the process of making retention decisions with respect to the files of closed cases.847  The memorandum gave Mrs. Clinton three options with regard to any file: keep it intact, microfilm and then destroy it, or destroy it without microfilming.  The memorandum asked for a response by August 9, 1988.  

<P>Mrs. Clinton requested destruction, without microfilming, of four Madison Guaranty files, including two related specifically to the "I.D.C." matter and the "Ward Option."  The Special Committee finds it troubling that in July or August of 1988 Mrs. Clinton would order the destruction of these files.  Because the Ward v. Madison case was ongoing at the time, Mrs. Clinton might well have destroyed evidence relevant to the case.  Indeed, the May 1 option drafted by Mrs. Clinton was an important piece of evidence in the trial.  It seems reasonable to assume, moreover, that Mrs. Clinton was aware of the Ward v. Madison litigation, involving as it did her former clients.  Moreover, Webster Hubbell, her law partner and close friend, attended at least some of the trial.848  

<P>F.<P>Webster Hubbell's Mysterious Role in Structuring Questionable Castle Grande Transactions

<P>It is unclear the extent of the involvement Webster Hubbell, Seth Ward's son-in-law, with respect to providing legal advice to Mr. Ward relating to the Castle Grande transaction.  Mr. Hubbell's statements on this matter are contradictory to each other, contradictory to the testimony of other witnesses and contradictory to documentary evidence.  His statements also defy common sense.  Even Mr. McDougal's secretary, Ms. Strayhorn, expressed surprise when told that Mr. Hubbell did not prepare the May 1 option for his father-in-law.849  In a hearing before the Special Committee she asked, "Why wouldn't he [Ward] have his son-in-law prepare the document?"850

<P>Mr. Hubbell was in frequent contact with Mr. Ward.  Mr. Hubbell said that Mr. Ward and he talked about business constantly.851  Mr. Hubbell testified that Mr. Ward "talked to [Hubbell] a lot about deals," and "you couldn't stop him basically" from talking about business.852

<P>With respect to the Castle Grande transaction, Mr. Hubbell altered his story with respect to when he learned that Mr. Ward was a nominee purchaser for Madison Financial.  First, Mr. Hubbell testified that he understood in September 1985 based on what Mr. Ward told him that "Madison had limits on what it could own in its own name, and so Mr. Ward was going to own part of it until it could be sold."853  Also, in an interview with the RTC Inspector General, Mr. Hubbell "said that Ward told him that he was negotiating on behalf of Madison to buy the IDC property, which would then be split up between Madison and Ward."854  In testimony before the Special Committee, however, Mr. Hubbell repeatedly testified that he was not aware of the deal between Madison and Ward until after the closing in early October 1985.855

<P>Mr. Hubbell was reluctant to answer questions regarding his own view of the legality of Mr. Ward's role in the purchase of the IDC property.  When asked if he viewed it as a way to evade a regulatory restriction, Mr. Hubbell answered, "I have never represented an S&L.  I don't know whether it's illegal or not."856  When he was asked if he considered this transaction as a classic parking or warehousing transaction, Mr. Hubbell answered, "I think of parking and warehousing a little bit differently."857  When asked if he thought Mr. Ward could be considered a "straw man," Mr. Hubbell testified, "I didn't give it any consideration, you know.  'Straw man' means, to me, somebody who you clear title through."858

<P>Mr. Hubbell has denied advising Mr. Ward with respect to the transaction.859  He specifically denied preparing the backdated September 24, 1985 letter or advising Mr. Ward with respect to its preparation.860  Mr. Hubbell claimed that although he was aware of his father-in-law's deal with Mr. McDougal and discussed it with Mr. Ward, he does not recall discussing the September 24th letter.861  Mr. Hubbell claimed, "I recall discussing the nature of his deal with Madison, but not the letter, no."862

<P>There is evidence, however, that Mr. Hubbell may have prepared a backdated September 24, 1985 letter, which was found in his files at the Rose Law Firm.863  Martha Patton, Mr. Hubbell's secretary at the Rose Law Firm, has stated that although she does not recall typing the letter she believes she did because the type is similar to that of the IBM typewriter she used and the second page of the document is formatted in the style she used while a Rose secretary.864  She added that the letter appears to be "her style of typing."865  Mr. Hubbell testified that "it's certainly possible" that his secretary typed the agreement.866 26   And Alston Jennings testified that Mr. Ward told him that Mr. Hubbell's secretary had typed the letter.867  

<P>There is also some indication that Mr. Hubbell was supposed to prepare the May 1, 1986 option agreement.  Handwritten notes taken by James Clark, the examiner in charge of the 1986 examination of Madison Guaranty, reflect the following:

<P>MFC Commitment to buy land at corner of Route 145 . . .

<P>Option will be prepared,  atty out of town (Hubbell)

<P>  to replace note.868



The note strongly suggests a hitherto unknown involvement in Castle Grande by Mr. Hubbell.

<P>Mr. Clark has stated that he believes that the information reflected in the above note came from former Madison chief loan officer Don Denton.869  Although Mr. Denton does not believe that he was the source of information recorded by Mr. Clark, Mr. Denton has implied at other times that Mr. Hubbell advised Mr. Ward on the Castle Grande matter.870  For example, Mr. Denton believed that the wording on the note dated October 15, 1985 stating that Mr. Ward was not personally responsible for the note was prepared by Mr. Hubbell.871  Also, Mr. Denton believed that he had some conversations with Mr. Hubbell about the February 28, 1996 transaction.872

<P>Furthermore, Mr. Denton implied in his recent interview that Mr. Hubbell was involved in the March 31 and April 7 notes between Mr. Ward, Madison Guaranty, and Madison Financial.  He stated that he was "reasonably confident" that when Mrs. Clinton called him regarding these notes she was acting on Mr. Hubbell's behalf.873  Mr. Denton would not testify as to whether he ever dealt with Mr. Hubbell on the matter of the notes.874  He also declined to answer whether he had visited Mr. Hubbell's office at Rose regarding Mr. Ward or Madison Guaranty.875

<P>  Mr. Hubbell has not provided complete and accurate statements about his legal representation on other occasions.  He did so in 1989 when the Rose Law Firm was retained to represent the FDIC in the case against Madison Guaranty's former accountants.876  April Breslaw, the RTC attorney who hired the Rose Law Firm for the Frost litigation, testified that when she asked Mr. Hubbell about Mr. Ward, Mr. Hubbell informed her that he did not represent Mr. Ward.  He also told her "that his relationship with his father-in-law was not close."877  Ms. Breslaw was asked whether she believed Mr. Hubbell lied to her when she hired him, and she replied, "Yes, sir. I do."878  Even Mr. Hubbell admitted that he did not disclose to Ms. Breslaw his knowledge of the IDC transactions.879

<P>Mr. Hubbell did not provide complete and accurate statements about his legal representation again in 1993 when he failed to disclose information he had learned the previous year from reading the Rose Law Firm billing records to FDIC investigators looking into the 1989 retention of Rose.880  In 1993, FDIC investigators reported that in 1985, the Rose Law Firm represented Madison Guaranty before the Arkansas Securities Department on two matters.881  Mr. Hubbell admitted, however, that he was aware of additional matters on which the Rose firm had worked, including the IDC closing and the option agreement, on behalf of Madison, and that he did not disclose it to investigators.882

<P>In view of the foregoing, the Special Committee has no confidence in Mr. Hubbell's claim that he did not advise Mr. Ward with respect to Castle Grande.

<H3>PART III.     GOVERNOR CLINTON'S QUESTIONABLE RELATIONSHIP WITH DAN LASATER</H3>

     

I.<P>Governor Clinton's Close Personal Relationship With Dan Lasater



<P>After Governor Clinton was defeated for re-election in 1980, he met with Dan Lasater, George Locke and David Collins, Mr. Lasater's partners27  in Collins, Locke & Lasater,28  later changed to Lasater & Co., a newly formed investment bank.883<P>  According to Mr. Locke: "[I]t was a short time after the election, in fact I want to think maybe the next day . . . .  [H]e didn't take a day off."884  Mr. Clinton wanted to see "if Dan would support him in his efforts to regain the governor's seat."885   

<P>The meeting lasted a "couple" of hours, and the main topic of conversation was Mr. Clinton's plan to run for governor.886  Mr. Locke believed that Mr. Clinton approached Mr. Lasater because Stephens, Inc., Little Rock's largest financial firm, had supported Mr. Clinton's opponent, Frank White.887  Mr. Lasater claimed that he did not recall the meeting.888  

<P>In 1983, Roger Clinton, the Governor's brother, went to work for Mr. Lasater at his horse racing farm in Ocala, Florida.889  Mr. Lasater first met Roger Clinton when Roger was working as a musician in Hot Springs,890 sometime in the late 1970's or early 1980's,891 and that either Governor Clinton or his mother, Virginia Kelly, asked Mr. Lasater to hire Roger.892  In a 1986 FBI interview, however, Mr. Lasater stated that Governor Clinton, as opposed to Mrs. Kelly, asked him to hire Roger.893  Similarly, White House Deputy Director of Personnel Patsy Thomasson, Mr. Lasater's long-time friend and associate,894 testified that sometime in 1982 or 1983 Governor Clinton asked Mr. Lasater to give Roger Clinton a job.895

<P>Mr. Lasater supported Roger Clinton when he had trouble paying a drug-related debt.  In late February 1985, Roger Clinton was a witness at a friend's cocaine distribution trial in which he testified that Mr. Lasater, after learning of Roger Clinton's drug debts, loaned him $8,000 to retire them.896  Ms. Thomasson confirmed that Mr. Lasater provided Roger Clinton with a check for an amount "between $5,000 and $10,0000,"897 and Mr. Lasater admitted that he loaned Roger Clinton $8,000 to pay a debt to drug dealers.898  According to Mr. Lasater:

<P>Roger came to me and said that he owed a drug dealer $8,000, and that the drug dealer had threatened him, his mother and his brother [Governor Clinton] if they didn't pay and wanted to know if I would loan him the money, and I did.899

<P>Mr. Drake testified that Mr. Lasater provided him with cocaine while he was an employee of Lasater & Company, and that he believed that Mr. Lasater used cocaine as a tool to manipulate people.900  Mr. Lasater admitted before the Special Committee that he did give drugs to his employees.901  

<P>  On December 12, 1986, Mr. Lasater entered a guilty plea to the felony of "knowingly and intentionally conspiring to possess and to distribute cocaine."902  He served a 30-month sentence in prison.903

<P>Mr. Lasater claimed "that it has never been alleged that I committed any fraudulent act or lied in the course of any investigation."904  A federal bankruptcy judge, however, found, in open court, that Mr. Lasater lied under oath during the bankruptcy trial of his former business partner, George Locke, and also found that Mr. Lasater was involved in a conspiracy to defraud Mr. Locke's creditors.905  In January 1985, a Little Rock paper reported the judge's findings.906  During the same period of time, Mr. Lasater was attempting to secure the bond underwriting for the Arkansas State Police Radio bond financing.907  When asked about these findings, Mr. Lasater told the Special Committee, "I had forgotten about that."908  Mr. Lasater also admitted that he did not disclose to the state police his involvement in the conspiracy.909

<P> In 1984, Mr. Lasater sponsored a fundraiser for Governor Clinton in 1984.910  This fundraiser, held for over 100 people in Little Rock, raised approximately $50,000.911  Mr. Lasater testified that he and his family contributed a total of $8,000 to Governor Clinton in 1984, and that he also bought a table at a fundraiser for the Governor that cost between $6,000 and $12,000.912  Mr. Lasater believed that in 1982 he only contributed between $4,000 and $5,000 to Mr. Clinton.913  An affidavit that was supplied to the FDIC by Mrs. Clinton's attorney, David Kendall, identified at least $8,000 in contributions that were made by Mr. Lasater and Lasater controlled entities in 1982.914   Mr. Kendall's affidavit also listed $4,000 in contributions that Mr. Lasater and Lasater controlled entities gave to Governor Clinton in 1985.915  In addition, according to Mr. Lasater, Mr. Lasater provided Governor Clinton free use of Lasater owned aircraft.916 

<P>Mr. Lasater testified that he saw Governor Clinton only infrequently, and that he was "not a close friend" of Governor Clinton.917  Mr. Lasater claimed that he only visited Governor Clinton at the Mansion on two occasions, and that they "were both social events.  They weren't one-on-one meetings."918  There is evidence to the contrary.  Arkansas State trooper Barry Spivey has testified that while he was assigned to Governor's security unit from 1982-1984,919 he observed Mr. Lasater visiting Mr. Clinton at the Governor's Mansion, and that920 the Governor went "to Dan's a lot.  We went down there more than Dan came down there I would say."921  Mr. Spivey has testified that he normally did not enter Mr. Lasater into the Mansion's security logs "because I knew that he and Bill were friends, that they visited socially.  I had flown on his plane.  I knew that Bill spent a lot of time at Dan's office, and that Dan spent time at the Mansion."922  According to Trooper Spivey, "I probably saw Dan [at the Mansion] half a dozen times at least.  And I'm going to say that I took him by his office even more than that, just me personally."923  Mr. Spivey has testified that he took the Governor to visit Mr. Lasater's offices:

<P>I remember a lot of times taking Bill down to Dan's office and he would jump out and I'd circle and wait until he came back and, or I would go inside and stay in the lobby.924

Mr. Lasater did not recall Governor Clinton visiting the Lasater & Co. offices.925 

II.<P>Governor Clinton Provides Favors to Dan Lasater



<P>A.<P>Dan Lasater's Special Access to Governor Clinton



<P>Mr. Lasater further claimed that he felt he "never received any special treatment from Governor Clinton or anyone on his staff."926  Governor Clinton's staff, however, paid attention to recommendations to state board appointment by Mr. Lasater.927  For example, the Governor received a list of persons928 recommended by Mr. Lasater and his firm, Lasater & Co., for appointment or re-appointment to the Arkansas Housing Development Agency ("AHDA") Board, the agency to which Lasater & Co. submitted proposals to participate as underwriters in state bond issues.929    

<P>Documentary evidence indicates Mr. Lasater met with Governor Clinton.  On February 15, 1985, for example, Mr. Lasater wrote to Governor Clinton in part to thank him "for the opportunity to sit down and visit with you."930  Mr. Lasater admitted that the meeting referred to in the letter is "more than likely" a one-on-one meeting in January or February 1985 that he had with the Governor in his office in the State Capitol.931  One of the subjects raised in the letter deals with discussions held between the Governor and Mr. Lasater about the appointment of one of Mr. Lasater's AHDA Board candidates, Donald Spears.932

<P>Mr. Lasater also requested that Lasater & Company be advised "of all financing proposals effecting the state," prior to public announcement and stated that:

<P> we would be more comfortable if you would take the opportunity or ask someone on your staff to take the opportunity to appraise me or my staff of any actions by you or your staff prior to any public announcements so that we will not be surprised or in some instances embarrassed because of the announcement."933  

<P>On at least one occasion, Governor Clinton wrote a note to Chief of Staff Betsey Wright, Maurice Smith and "CG," on a piece of Lasater & Company stationary that appears to state, "need to fill their [Lasater & Co.] recs for SEC [Securities Commissioner] / AHDA."934  The Lasater & Co. stationary was attached to a written presentation that was prepared by Lasater & Co. and EF Hutton for a meeting that they had with the Governor on January 10, 1985 at the Legacy Hotel in Little Rock.935  An agenda for the meeting listed appointments for the Arkansas Securities Commissioner and the Arkansas Housing Development Agency as the first two orders of business.936   

<P>B.<P>The Governor's Office Steers Valuable State Bond Business to Dan Lasater



<P>The Special Committee is troubled by documentary and testimonial evidence indicating that Governor Clinton's office directed board members of the AHDA to award bond underwriting contracts to Mr. Lasater's firm, and that the Governor's office monitored and assisted Lasater & Co.'s efforts to secure the underwriting contract for the $29.2 million bond financing of a state police radio system.

<P>Prior to 1983, Collins, Locke & Lasater did not participate as an underwriter for any AHDA bond offerings.937  On February 17, 1983, the AHDA Housing Subcommittee selected Collins, Locke & Lasater to serve as an underwriter for one of the agency's housing bond financing.938  Charles Stout, who was Chairman of the agency's board at the time, described the circumstances surrounding the inclusion of Collins, Locke & Lasater as a member of the AHDA's Single Family Housing underwriting team.

<P>According to Mr. Stout, thirty minutes before an AHDA Board meeting, he received a telephone call from Bob Nash, who was Governor Clinton's assistant for economic issues:29 

<P>He was on the governor's staff over there.  We had selected underwriters for an issue, and he called over and asked me to cut in Lasater for 15 percent.  I said Bob that's not right, the governor's office is not to interfere with this agency.  And he said, well, that's the way we want it anyway.939 

<P>The Governor's office directive to award Collins, Locke and Lasater fifteen percent of the underwriting contract concerned Mr. Stout for a number of reasons.  He stated that "he [Lasater] was a local underwriter and rather inexperienced, that was what I didn't like about it."940  The AHDA had also already selected the group of underwriters that it wanted to cover the offering in question.941  Mr. Stout had difficulty recalling with specificity that the phone call was received on February 17, but he did know that Collins, Locke & Lasater had not participated as an underwriter for any AHDA offerings prior to Mr. Nash's call.942  

<P>Linda Chandler, formerly Linda Trent, then acting executive director of AHDA and a Lasater-recommended appointee, testified that the Lasater firm had never been a member of an underwriting team prior to February 17, and that she had never even heard of the firm prior to the firm's inclusion in the single family underwriting.943 

<P>Mr. Stout was upset by the instructions from the Governor's office to choose the Lasater firm, and he told his fellow Board member Mort Hardwicke:30  "I thought it was wrong for the governor's office to tell us how to run our business over there."944  Mr. Stout further testified: "[w]ell the governor's office doesn't interfere with the directors of the Arkansas Housing Development Agency and tell them what underwriter to use.  That business is the director's business, nobody else's."945  

<P>Mr. Nash's directive had surprised Mr. Stout, and he believed that the request threatened the independence of the AHDA.946  Mr. Stout was not aware of any previous instances where the governor's office had ever inserted itself into the underwriting selection process--particularly to tell the board "what underwriter to use."947  The request threatened the independence of the agency in fulfilling its responsibilities.948

<P>Mr. Stout recognized the significance of Mr. Nash's directive, and he asked Mr. Hardwicke to pick up another telephone receiver to listen to the call.949  Mr. Hardwicke claimed in his deposition that he had no knowledge that the Governor's office identified an individual firm that it wanted to receive AHDA business.950  When Mr. Hardwicke was confronted with Mr. Stout's testimony that he had actually listened to the phone conversation that took place between Mr. Stout and Mr. Nash, he said that he did not "recall the incident," but he did not doubt Mr. Stout's testimony.951  After Mr. Stout and Mr. Hardwicke got off the phone with Mr. Nash, they discussed what Mr. Nash had told Mr. Stout to do and decided that they would have to approach each of the board members individually and tell them that Mr. Nash had given the directive to include the Lasater firm in the underwriting.952

<P>After Mr. Nash told Mr. Stout to "cut in" Lasater for 15 percent of the underwriting for the 1983 Series A $26,365,000 Single Family issue that was discussed during the February 17 Housing Sub-Committee meeting, Mr. Stout informed him that the board would comply with the governor's office's request.953  In fact, the minutes of the Subcommittee show that Collins, Locke & Lasater received 13 1/3 percent of the bond underwriting contract.954 

<P>Mr. Stout also explained that Mr. Nash's request to include the Lasater firm as an underwriter was not limited to the one issue that was considered on February 17.  Mr. Nash's directive required that Collins, Locke & Lasater be included as an underwriter in "any future issues for 15 percent."955  Mr. Stout confirmed that Mr. Lasater's firm was included in subsequent issues in compliance with Mr. Nash's directive.956  Mr. Lasater's company participated as an underwriter in $637 million dollars worth of AHDA/ADFA bond offerings between 1983 and 1986.957

<P>According to the minutes of the AHDA Executive Board minutes for April 12, 1983, the Board unanimously approved the recommendation of the Multi-family Housing Sub-Committee to retain Merrill Lynch as the lead underwriter and to include Stephens Inc. and TJ Raney & Sons as the local underwriters for the agency's Multi Family Housing issue.95831   The AHDA Special Executive Board minutes from April 19, 1983, show that Collins, Locke & Lasater was added to the "underwriting team for the agency's proposed 1983 Multi-Family Issue."959

<P>Linda Chandler, AHDA's Executive Director, agreed that before Collins, Locke and Lasater was added to the Multi-Family Housing issue, that the board had already "carefully considered and discussed" which local firms would participate in the offering.960  The last-minute inclusion of Mr. Lasater's firm into this bond underwriting syndicate was a circumvention of the normal process of careful debate that was part of the AHDA's underwriter selection process.961  In fact, Ms. Chandler agreed that during her four years at the agency, she is not aware of any other "circumstance where, at the last minute, after the recommending committee had made up its lists of participants," another firm was added to the syndicate.962  

<P>After Collins, Locke & Lasater's unprecedented inclusion on the underwriting team, Stephens, Inc., one of the firms that had been chosen during the April 12 Executive Board meeting, withdrew from the deal in protest.963  Ms. Chandler said that no financial firms had ever withdrawn from an AHDA underwriting because they were upset that the normal process of selection had been violated.964  Mr. Nash denied that he ever directed Mr. Stout to award business to the Lasater firm.965

<P>In 1984, an Arkansas state trooper was shot and killed during a traffic stop in a section of Arkansas that was not covered by the state's antiquated communications system.966  Although the state police had recognized the need to acquire a new communications system as early as two years before the trooper's death, this event served as a catalyst for the police to plan for the acquisition of a new system.967  On the way to the trooper's funeral with Governor Clinton, Colonel Tommy Goodwin, the Director of the Arkansas State Police ("ASP"), approached the Governor about the need for the state to acquire a new communications system.968  Colonel Goodwin informed the Governor that a new system would cost the state an estimated $17-$18 million dollars and the Governor indicated he would support the acquisition of a new system.969 

<P>On April 4, 1985, Governor Clinton signed into law Act 817, "An act authorizing the leasing of communications equipment for the Department of the Arkansas State Police; providing for the payment and security of the costs of the equipment; and for other purposes."970  This legislation established, among other things, the methods of financing that could be used in connection with providing the state with a new police communications system.

<P>Flight logs maintained for Mr. Lasater's aircrafts show that Governor Clinton received a free flight on a Lasater-owned plane shortly after he signed the enabling legislation.971  On May 10, 1985 the Arkansas State Police Commission ("Commission") voted to award the underwriting contract for the financing of the new system to a syndicate of financial firms that included Lasater & Company.972  Lasater & Co.'s share of the fees for this project was $115,040.00.973  

<P>The Special Committee has obtained information indicating that the Lasater syndicate obtained an unfair advantage over the other firms competing for this lucrative underwriting contract.  The Lasater group worked closely with the law firm that advised the Governor's office on this matter and drafted the actual legislation.974  Moreover, once the legislation was passed, the governor's office monitored the Lasater firm's progress in the bidding process.975  Later, the same law firm that had represented Lasater and drafted the legislation, was retained to write an opinion on the meaning of the law; the opinion would, in large measure, determine which firm won the underwriting contract.976  Not surprisingly, the statement the firm favored the Lasater firm, which was awarded a portion of the lucrative contract.977

<P>Michael Drake, an executive vice president at the Lasater firm testified that Lasater, T.J. Raney, and E.F. Hutton formed a syndicate to compete for the financing contract for the police radio project "right after Bill [Clinton] was elected to his second term [of office]."978  Bob Snider of T.J. Raney testified that he first discussed this offering with Mr. Drake in November 1984, and that Mr. Drake indicated to him that the Lasater firm had already been working on "the state police deal."979   Mr. Snider was under the impression that Mr. Drake had been engaged in discussions with Samuel Bratton, Governor Clinton's Counsel, about the police radio project prior to a meeting that Mr. Snider had with Mr. Bratton in November.980

<P>According to Mr. Drake, Lasater & Co. was approached by T.J. Raney because of Mr. Lasater's relationship with Governor Clinton:

<P>One, they knew that while Bill was [out of] office, that there were two firms in Little Rock that - two investment firms that helped him with a variety of different things.  One was Lasater & Company - one was Dan Lasater, and the other was Doobie Sullivan.981

Mr. Snider testified that Mr. Lasater's strong political connections was one of the reasons that his firm decided to include them in the syndicate.982   

<P>After Mr. Drake was contacted by T.J. Raney, he told Mr. Lasater that T.J. Raney had approached Lasater & Co. "because of your relationship with Bill, to try to get this legislation passed."983  Mr. Drake said he then identified for Mr. Lasater the steps that he thought were necessary in order to secure the underwriting contract for the police radio financing.  The three steps he identified included finding a law firm to draft the legislation, working with the Governor's office, and explaining to the state police "what we are trying to do."984

<P>Betsey Wright, the Governor's Chief of Staff testified that she was under the impression that the Mitchell, Williams firm was working on the legislation for the Governor's office, and that they were not working for the Lasater syndicate.985  Ms. Wright further stated that she was not aware that the Lasater firm had retained Mitchell, Williams to represent them in connection with their efforts to secure the underwriting contract.986   

<P>Billing records from Mitchell, Williams, however, indicate that the law firm had numerous meetings and conferences with members of the Governor's staff on behalf of the Lasater group, and that the Governor's office likely knew that Mr. Lasater had engaged the Mitchell firm.987  In fact, in a letter dated January 23, 1985 that Mr. Lasater sent to the Governor, Mr. Lasater informed the Governor that he was working with Bill Woodyard, a Mitchell, Williams attorney, "to help workout financing details."988  Mr. Young testified that Mr. Lasater engaged Mitchell, Williams to "develop the legislation and other things to implement the transaction."98932  

<P>During the May 10, 1985 ASP Commission meeting where the Lasater group was chosen to perform the underwriting for the financing of the project,990 "some" of the firms that had given presentations to the Commission, "requested permission to revise their proposals as they felt there had been some misunderstanding of the Act."991  This dispute centered around the fact that the Lasater group's proposal called for annual and semi-annual lease payments, and First Capital's proposal called for monthly lease payments.992  A proposal that incorporated deferred payments, "allowed for more arbitrage to be credited against that present value cost."993  

<P>In an apparent effort to quiet the controversy surrounding the different interpretations of the law, the Mitchell -- Mr. Lasater's firm -- was retained by the Arkansas Office of State Purchasing to render a legal opinion as to "whether Section Five of the Act requires Lease Payments, as defined in Section Three of the Act, are required to be made on a monthly basis to investors who purchase an interest in a Lease Agreement authorized by the Act."994  This issue had been raised by the First Capital firm and was the basis for their request for a chance to revise their proposal.995  

<P>Mr. Mitchum, the Police Commissioner who was asked to review the different proposals for the Commission, testified that First Capital and the Lasater group were "neck and neck," but that the delayed payments called for in the Lasater proposal made their bid more attractive.996  As a result, the opinion given by Mitchell Williams33  favored the interpretation of the law that their client Lasater & Co. had relied on. 

<P>Section Five does not state to whom the monthly transfers out of the Lease Fund are to be made.  Therefore there is no requirement that the transfers be made to the ultimate payee or lessor under the Lease Agreement.997 

Mr. Mitchum agreed with First Capital's analysis that the Act called for the state to make these payments on a monthly basis.998

<P>On May 1, 1985 nine days before the ASP Commission awarded the bond underwriting contract to the Lasater syndicate, Michael Gaines of the Governor's staff,34  sent a memorandum directly to Governor that contained a head count as to which ASP Commissioner's favored or disfavored giving the police radio underwriting contract to Mr. Lasater.999  Lasater & Co. is the only firm that is referenced in Mr. Gaines' report to the Governor.  In addition, the memorandum contains hand written notes from Betsey Wright that are directed to the Governor, which read in part, "[w]e have a real problem here since 'street talk' is that Lasater (sic) put in unreasonably low bid knowing that he can raise it once he gets it."1000  Ms. Wright's note implies that the governor's office had an interest in Mr. Lasater's participation in the project, and that if Mr. Lasater was involved in submitting a low bid it could cause the Governor's office a "real problem."  The Governor replied: "Lasater should be told bid must price."1001

<P>Ms. Wright sent Governor Clinton sent another memorandum on the subject of Mr. Lasater's activities related to the state police radio financing on May 13, 1985.1002  The memorandum informed Governor Clinton that the Lasater group faced potential threat from a member the Legislature that was threatening to go to the Telecommunications Study Committee to insist on an alternative form of financing that would eliminate the deal Lasater had made with the ASP Commission.1003  Ms. Wright also informed the Governor that she alerted "Drake," suggesting that the Governor was familiar with Mr. Lasater's executive vice president.1004

<P>On May 15, 1985, Mr. Gaines drafted yet another memorandum on the subject of Lasater's ability to participate as an underwriter on the police radio project.1005  The May 15 memorandum was addressed to Ms. Wright and dealt specifically with the controversy surrounding the First Capital group's protest.  Mr. Gaines' memorandum reads in part: 

<P>The Capital Resources group [First Capital], which did not get the ASP Commission's nod, intend to contest the award to Hutton, Lasater, Raney on the following points: 1) Capital offers a fixed rate rather than a floating rate, and 2) Capital's proposal  was based on monthly payments by the state to repay the debt while H,R,L based their proposal on payments every 6 months.  Capital points out that the legislation (written by H,R,L) requires monthly payments.1006

<P>These communications between the Governor and his staff clearly indicate that the Governor's office had a keen interest in not only Mr. Lasater's participation in the police radio underwriting contest, but in helping ensure that Mr. Lasater's firm was able to secure the contract.

<P> During February 1985, two months before the ASP sent out requests for proposals for the state police radio financing, news accounts likely put Governor Clinton and members of the ASP Commission on notice that Mr. Lasater used cocaine, and that he was the possible target of a drug investigation.

<P>On February 27, 1985, The Arkansas Gazette reported that a witness in the drug trial of Hot Springs lawyer, Sam Anderson, Gina Canada, said in her sworn testimony that Dan Lasater had given Roger Clinton $8,000 to pay off drug debts, and that Mr. Lasater "also used cocaine."1007  The next day, another article appeared in The Arkansas Gazette that reported on the sworn testimony given by Mr. Anderson:

<P>"In the summer of 1984, Anderson said Roger Clinton had told him that he had to see him.  They arranged to meet in a boat on Lake Hamilton because [Roger] Clinton said he didn't want to be seen in a public place with Anderson. . .  Anderson said [Roger] Clinton told him that he had been approached by State Police investigators and that he was very, very frightened, totally frightened to death.  He said [Roger] Clinton informed him that the investigators wanted to set up three people:[Roger] Clinton's drug supplier, Anderson and Lasater."1008 

<P>Although this trial occurred in Little Rock, Colonel Goodwin claimed that he was not aware of this testimony about Mr. Lasater even though it was printed in one of the state's two largest papers.1009  Colonel Goodwin also asserted that he did not believe that an investigation of Mr. Lasater's drug activity had been initiated by the "summer of 1984."1010

<P>In any event, Colonel Goodwin testified that he had at least one conversation with Governor Clinton, during which Mr. Lasater's drug use was discussed.  Mr. Goodwin stated: 

<P>I remember at least one of those meetings was after the legislation had passed.  Governor Clinton, myself and a lot of other people knew that Dan Lasater was a user of cocaine.  The conversation with the Governor, Clinton . . . was we sure don't want any firm involved in financing this that is about to be arrested for selling cocaine.  I think he directed that statement to me in particular.1011

<P>Colonel Goodwin believed that he implied to Governor Clinton that Mr. Lasater should not be have been involved in the financing for the police radio system, and that he was concerned about Mr. Lasater's participation in the deal.1012  Mr. Goodwin said that he recognized that it would have been problematic to have a financial adviser with a drug problem doing work for the state.1013

<P>   The fact that it was well known or understood that Mr. Lasater was a cocaine user, gave Colonel Goodwin reason enough to disqualify Mr. Lasater from getting this police radio financing contract, and he believes that he made the Governor aware of his sentiments.1014  At this point, the Governor asked Colonel Goodwin to ascertain if Lasater was in danger of being caught for using cocaine.1015  Colonel Goodwin agreed that Governor Clinton's focus was not on Mr. Lasater's use of cocaine, rather it was directed toward determining whether he was going to be arrested for such use while his company was handling the police radio transaction.1016

<P>Colonel Goodwin then asked a captain in the ASP's Criminal Investigation Department to "quietly find out if there was a major investigation or any investigation going on Dan Lasater at the time."1017   Betsey Wright testified that she also asked Colonel Goodwin to inquire as to whether there were any ongoing criminal investigations of Mr. Lasater.  She testified that he reported back to her that there were no investigations outstanding.1018 

<P>On December 14, 1983, Mr. Lasater sent Governor Clinton a letter discussing a forthcoming bond liquidation.1019  At the top of the letter is a note written by Mr. Clinton.  The part of the note that is discernable addresses Linda Garner,1020 who, at the time, was Insurance Commissioner for the State of Arkansas.1021  The note, presumably written in reaction to the information in the letter, reads, "MS [...] after Garner [...] you talk to her-- we must give him [...] B."1022  Although the note is not precise as to what Governor Clinton wanted to give to Mr. Lasater, he apparently wanted to give him something involving Ms. Garner.  That the letter discusses a liquidation of bonds by insurance companies, and suggests that Mr. Clinton wanted to provide liquidation business to Mr. Lasater.  

<P>In the summer of 1983, during her tenure as Insurance Commissioner, Ms. Garner placed Mount Hood Pension Fund, National Investors Life Insurance, and National Investors Pension Fund into receivership and became the receiver.1023  Near the end of 1983, Mr. Lasater's company contacted Ms. Garner and expressed a desire to help with the administration of the firm's insurance portfolios.1024  Sometime later, according to Ms. Garner, Governor Clinton "[e]xpressed concern that an Arkansas firm that had been handling might be losing the business...."1025  The Governor also suggested "[a]pointing a broker from E.F. Hutton to select who the portfolio manager would be."1026  Ms. Garner deemed Governor Clinton's suggestion to be inappropriate and told him so.1027  Mr. Lasater's firm had close ties with E.F. Hutton.

<H2>PART IV.  DAVID HALE AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT SERVICES, INC.</H2>

I. The Special Committee's Attempts To Obtain Hale Testimony

<P>The Special Committee unsuccessfully sought to obtain the testimony of David Hale, former president of Capital Management Services, Inc., who was a critical witness in the recently concluded Tucker-McDougal trial.  

<P>In October and December 1995, the Committee was informed by the Office of the Independent Counsel that the OIC's "investigations and prosecutions would be seriously hindered or impeded if the Committee examined in any forum," David Hale,1028 and that hearings "prior to the trial of United States v. James B. McDougal, et al., regarding ....Capital Management Services" would hinder or impede their investigations and prosecutions.1029  As a result, the Special Committee postponed examination of Mr. Hale and hearings into Capital Management Services until after the Tucker-McDougal trial.

<P>On May 17, 1996, after the conclusion of the trial, the Special Committee requested that Mr. Hale make himself available to provide deposition and hearing testimony.1030  Mr. Hale's attorney, Theodore B. Olson, responded that "based on the rights guaranteed to him [Mr. Hale] by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, Mr. Hale respectfully" declines to appear before the Special Committee.1031  Mr. Olson stated that "Mr. Hale has been explicitly threatened, in writing, with prosecution in Arkansas by Arkansas state authorities."1032  Mr. Olson further stated that Mr. Hale "has been advised that any testimony that he may give before the Special Committee may be used against him by Arkansas prosecutors in any such future proceeding in Arkansas."1033  

<P>On June 5, 1996, the Committee subpoenaed Mr. Hale to make himself available for deposition and public hearing.  Mr. Hale again asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege.1034  John A. Mintz, an attorney for Mr. Hale, wrote: "In absence of a court order to testify and a grant of immunity as provided by Federal law," any testimony Mr. Hale may give before the Special Committee "may be used against" Mr. Hale.1035

<P>On June 11, 1996, the Special Committee was not able to secure the 12 votes required to grant Mr. Hale limited use immunity for his testimony to the Special Committee.  Therefore, the Committee will not have Mr. Hale's testimony to evaluate matters related to Capital Management Services as set forth in Senate Resolution 120.

II. Mr. Hale's Testimony in the McDougal Trial: What was Governor Clinton's Role in the Making of the $300,000 Master Marketing Loan?

<P>Mr. Hale testified as a prosecution witness for nine days at the Tucker-McDougal.  Specifically, Mr. Hale testified that he has known James McDougal, Jim Guy Tucker, and President Clinton for over 20 years.  He met Mr. McDougal in 1959, when he and Mr. McDougal were members of the same fraternity at University of Arkansas.1036  Mr. Hale met Jim Guy Tucker in the mid-1960s and hired Mr. Tucker as his lawyer in 1980.1037  Mr. Hale met President Clinton in the early 1970s.1038  Mr. Hale continued his relationship with these three men throughout the 1980s.<P>  In 1979, Mr. Hale obtained a license for an Small Business Investment Corporation ("SBIC"), Capital Management Services, Inc.1039  This SBIC was required to loan money to those who were economically or socially disadvantaged.1040

<P>Mr. Hale testified that in the fall 1985, Mr. Tucker asked him to attend a meeting with Mr. McDougal and Mr. Tucker.1041  The three drove to Mr. McDougal's newly purchased Castle Grande development to view the site.1042  Mr. McDougal said to Mr. Hale, "I'm going to need some funds, and we're going to have to clean up some members of the political family."1043  Mr. Hale testified that when Mr. McDougal said "political family," he understood that Mr. McDougal meant "Bill Clinton, and some of his aides, Jim Guy Tucker and some of McDougal's associates."1044

<P>Mr. Hale testified that later that evening, he and Messrs. McDougal and Tucker went to Mr. Tucker's house and reached an agreement related to a scheme to defraud the Small Business Administration by fraudulently obtaining money from CMS.1045  The agreement consisted of a plan to have Mr. Tucker "get my purchase of the property completed as fast as possible."1046  After the sale, Mr. Hale would look for a buyer of the property, "someone we could put the property's name in."1047  Madison Guaranty would finance the purchase, and according to Mr. Hale, "Jim would see to it that Madison Guaranty would make the loan on the purchase enough so that we would have $500,000 put in the SBIC."1048  Mr. Hale explained, "[I]n order for Jim Guy and Jim and others to have the funds they needed, we had to take the money from Madison, put it into the SBIC, and then loan it back out."1049

<P>Messrs. Tucker, McDougal and Hale decided on $500,000 to enable CMS to increase its SBIC loan limit from $150,000 to $300,000.1050  Mr. McDougal told Mr. Hale that the urgency of the loan stemmed from the fact that federal regulators were coming in to examine Madison Guaranty.1051

<P>In either January or February 1986, Mr. McDougal asked Mr. Hale to meet with Mr. McDougal and then-Governor Clinton "to talk about getting the loan ready and consummated."1052  Mr. Hale went to Mr. McDougal's office at Castle Grande (where McDougal had moved when the examiners came into the S&L), and the three allegedly discussed the loan Mr. Hale was going to make.1053

<P>Mr. McDougal proposed that the loan be made to Susan McDougal.1054  Governor Clinton allegedly offered to provide as security for the loan property in Marion County (where Whitewater is located).1055  Mr. McDougal also offered to put up as security his stock in Madison Guaranty.1056  Governor Clinton then allegedly told Mr. Hale "be sure -- my name cannot show up on this."1057

<P>The transactions were consummated in February-April of 1986.  On February 28, 1986, Madison Guaranty lent Dean Paul, Ltd. $1.2 million.  According to the plan, Mr. Hale used $502,000 to put capital in CMS and applied for an additional $500,000 of matching funds from the SBA.1058   This capital infusion raised CMS's lending limit to $300,000.1059

<P>On April 3, 1986, Mr. Hale, through CMS, made a $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal d/b/a Master Marketing.1060  Mrs. McDougal's application for the loan stated that Master Marketing was an advertising company.35   Mr. Hale knew that the statement was untruthful.1061

<P>Mr. Hale testified that he looked to then-Governor Clinton and Mr. McDougal to repay the loan because he believed that they were receiving the proceeds.1062  In May 1986, Mr. McDougal contacted Mr. Hale in an attempt to alter the original loan documents because things were going bad at Madison.1063

<P>In 1991, auditors questioned Mr. Hale about repayment of the loan.1064  Mr. Hale arranged with Mr. McDougal's attorney to obtain a judgement, which would satisfy the auditors.1065  Suit was filed, and Mrs. McDougal agreed to the judgement, although it was not collectable and only affected how much money Mr. Hale could have in CMS and how much money Mr. Hale could draw. 1066  Mr. Hale persuaded a friend to buy the loan and give CMS a note for it.  The purpose of the note was to give the appearance to the auditors that the loan had been paid.  Mr. Hale sent a letter to the SBA indicating that the Master Marketing loan had been paid in full, thereby hiding the loss.1067

<P>The district court judge in the Tucker-McDougal trial refused to allow Mr. Hale to testify to the other two meetings that Mr. Hale has asserted he had with President Clinton.  Mr. Hale has stated that shortly after the initial meeting with Mr. McDougal and Mr. Clinton, he ran into Mr. Clinton on the steps of the Arkansas Capitol.  Governor Clinton allegedly approached Mr. Hale and said that Mr. McDougal would call Mr. Hale.  Governor Clinton allegedly hoped that Mr. Hale would help Mr. McDougal.

<P>Mr. Hale has further alleged that a third meeting took place at a Little Rock shopping mall.  Governor Clinton, agitated, allegedly asked Mr. Hale:  "Do you know what that ---- Susan did with the money?"1068  

<P>William Watt, Mr. Hale's business associate also recalled the involvement of Governor Clinton in the Dean Paul loan.1069  Mr. Watt recalled going to Mr. Hale's office, and Mr. Hale was anxious about getting the appraisals done quickly.1070  Mr. Hale told Mr. Watt: "I've got to have this done."1071  Mr. Hale said he had been "to a meeting out at the Capitol ....or the Governor's mansion."1072  Mr. Hale also said, "And Governor Clinton is interested.  He wants me to try to get it to him to help his friends."1073  During a subsequent telephone conversation with Mr. Watt, Mr. Hale raised the Governor's name again.1074  According to Mr. Watt, Governor Clinton asked Mr. Hale, "Did you get my friends"--- "Did you get my deal done?  Did you help my friends?"1075

<P>Robert Palmer, a real estate appraiser who worked on the appraisal of the property, provided testimony at the Tucker-McDougal trial concerning the involvement of politicians.  Mr. Palmer testified that Mr. Watt, called told Mr. Palmer that the appraisals of the property had to be increased.1076  Mr. Watt told Mr. Palmer that "they really needed a higher figure on the property" and that "David Hale was doing a favor for Jim McDougal."1077  Mr. Palmer testified that Mr. Watt instructed him to "do whatever [he has] to do" even if that meant they "use an inflated value."1078  Mr. Watt told Mr. Palmer not to "worry about any repercussions.1079  Everybody knows about the deal ....this goes all the way, you know, to the top."1080  Mr. Palmer asked if it was "McDougal" and Watt said "higher."1081  Mr. Palmer said "politically" and Watt said "yes."1082

<P>Special Agent Michael Patkus of the FBI testified at the trial that of the $300,000 loan from CMS to Master Marketing, $111,500 went to Flowerwood Farms to be used for loan payments.1083  One of the checks drawn on the Flowerwood Farms account was written to Whitewater Development Corporation in the amount of $24,455.06.1084  The memo section of the check reflected that the funds were for a loan.1085  Agent Patkus testified that the funds were deposited in Whitewater's account at Madison Guaranty were used to cover a check, dated March 22, 1985.1086  According to Agent Patkus, this March 22 check was made payable to Ozark Realty for $25,000.1087

<P>President Clinton admitted that he went to Mr. McDougal's office at Castle Grande one time, but denied that Mr. Hale was present during the meeting.1088  Mr. McDougal admitted, however, that he told an FBI agent on July 17, 1995, that Mr. Clinton had visited him at his Castle Grande offices on several occasions. The President claimed he was never present at any meeting between Mr. McDougal and Mr. Hale.1089  Moreover, he denied telling Mr. Hale that his name could not appear on any loan or financial documents or that Mr. Hale could use President Clinton's property in Marion County as security for a loan.1090  The President denied that he ever asked or pressured Mr. Hale to make a loan to him, Mr. McDougal, Mrs. McDougal or Mr. Tucker.  The President alleged that Mr. Hale "has told two or three different stories" but they are "simply not true."1091  The President denied having knowledge of or receiving the proceeds from the $300,000 loan from Capital Management Services to Master Marketing.1092 

<P>The Independent Counsel presented other evidence  corroborating Mr. Hale's testimony about the meetings with President Clinton.  A message slip from President Clinton indicates that he wants to meet with McDougal on a Saturday in January.  Mr. McDougal claimed he does not know if he told Hale about that meeting, but he believes he did not.1093  Another message slip indicates that Mr. McDougal called President Clinton on the Friday following the Saturday meeting.  Mr. McDougal claimed that he does not know why he called the Governor on that day.1094  Mr. McDougal also did not recall why the Governor called him on February 3, 1986.1095

<H3>PART VI.     THE LENDING ACTIVITIES OF PERRY COUNTY BANK IN THE 1990 CLINTON GUBERNATORIAL CAMPAIGN  </H3>   



<P>S. Res 120 &#167; 1 (b)(3)(G) authorized the Special Committee to Investigate Whitewater Development Corporation and Related Matters to investigate the "lending activities of Perry County Bank, Perryville, Arkansas, in connection with the 1990 Arkansas gubernatorial election."

<P>The Committee began its investigation into these lending activities by subpoenaing documents from a number of agencies and individuals.   Although the Committee did receive relevant records, it did not complete a comprehensive examination of this matter.  The Committee deferred to the Office of the Independent Counsel's concerns and has decided to not hold public hearings, or compile a public record on this matter.  

<P>The Office of the Independent counsel stated in letters dated April 30, 1996 and May 13, 1996, in response to the Special Committee inquiries of March 28, 1996 and April 18, 1996, that its investigation would be hindered if the Committee examined a number of witnesses regarding Perry County Bank.  Also, as requested in a June 12, 1996 letter from the Independent Counsel, the Committee has not included matters relating to the Perry County Bank in its report.   

<P>In the interest of ensuring the ability of the Independent Counsel to pursue its investigation the Committee deferred to the request of the Independent Counsel and did not pursue matters relating to the Perry County Bank.  It is unfortunate that the Committee could not fully complete its mandate under S. Res. 120.  Nevertheless the Committee does not wish to impede or hinder the efforts of the Independent Counsel, or create a situation that may impinge on the rights of any individual to receive a fair trial.

<H3>ENDNOTES FOR PART 1:  THE FOSTER PHASE</H3>



    1 Elsewhere in his notes, Mr. Foster wrote:<BR>

<P>A.<P>Colo analysis was of economic loss

<P><P>(1)  did not take into account interest deductions

<P><P>(2)  calculation included some items for which there were no canceled cks.

Williams & Connolly Document DKSN000517.  "Colo analysis" was an apparent reference to the Lyons report.

    2 In a later interview with the FBI, Ms. Seidman acknowledged that she worked with Foster on "accusations concerning shorted health positions taken by HILLARY CLINTON in connection with Value Partners."  II Hearings, p. 1794. 

    3 See, e.g., Stefan Fatsis, Stocks Sink on Clinton Economic Plan, Associated Press, Feb. 16, 1993 ("Pharmaceutical stocks led yesterday's decline.  Clinton week accused drug companies of price gouging and made them a prime target of health care reform efforts").  A detailed University of Michigan study concluded that the public pronouncements of the Clintons criticizing pharmaceutical firms depressed stock prices of those firms by as much as 27 percent.  S. Craig Pirrong, Political Rhetoric and Stock Price Volatility:  A Case Study, Catalyst Institute Research Project, University of Michigan, November 1993.

    4 In reality, the number of lawyers in the Bush administration was about 14, the same as under President Reagan.  Jeremy Rabkin, "At the President's Side: The Role of the White House Counsel in Constitutional Policy," Law and Contemporary Problems, Volume 56, Autumn 1993, at 63, 71 n. 39.  Although the official directory of the Clinton White House lists, in addition to the Counsel and his deputy, only several Associate Counsels, the staff actually includes about 13 lawyers.  Id. at 71, n. 39.  According to one commentator, "Official listings of the White House staff never give the full number of lawyers because extra lawyers are usually `detailed' from departments to circumvent congressional restrictions or concerns about excessive size of the full time staff."  Ibid.

    5 It is illustrative to compare Mr. Nussbaum's vision of the White House Counsel with that of his successor, Lloyd Cutler, who said upon his appointment:



<P>The Counsel is supposed to be counsel for the President in office and for the Office of the Presidency. . . .  When it comes to a President's private affairs, particularly private affairs that occurred before he took office, those should be handled by his own personal private counsel and, in my view, not by the White House Counsel.



Remarks Announcing the Appointment of Lloyd Cutler as Special Counsel to the President and an Exchange with Reporter, 30 Wkly Comp. Pres. Document 462, 465 (Mar. 8, 1994).

    6 The remainder of the index was redacted.

    7 All the other materials on the index, as in the first index, had been redacted.

    8 A file labelled "WHITEWATER DEVELOPMENT, Personal and Confidential   VWF" was transferred from Foster's office to the Clintons' personal lawyers.

    9 Likewise, neither Mr. Spafford's nor Mr. Sloan's notes listed Mr. Foster's personal diary during the transition period--which Park Police investigator John Rolla later reviewed, Rolla, 6/20/95 Dep. p. 96--or Foster's notebook on the Travelgate scandal, White House Documents F000002-F000162, which Mr. Nussbaum apparently removed from Mr. Foster's briefcase on July 22, 1993, and kept in a safe until March, 1994.  Letter from Abner J. Mikva, Counsel to the President, to Hon. William F. Clinger, Chairman, House Committee on Government Reform & Oversight, August 30, 1995, p. 1.

    10 Like Mr. Nussbaum, the President and Mrs. Clinton have denied knowledge of Foster's work involving Whitewater.  Following are excerpts from a deposition of President Clinton by former Special Counsel Robert Fiske:



<P>Q:  Was he [Foster] during this period of time working on any matters for you personally?

<P>A:  Yes, I believe that he was trying to handle the transition of our assets into a blind trust.  I think that's all he was doing.

<P>Q:  Were you aware that he was also doing some work in connection with the preparation and filing of the tax returns for Whitewater for '90, '91, and '92?

<P>A:  I don't recall that I was aware of that, no.

Fiske received the same testimony from the First Lady:

<P>Q:  Was he [Foster] doing any personal work for you or the President other than the blind trust?

<P>A:  Not that I'm aware of, no.  Oh, wait.  The only thing I would add to that is I think he also did some personal advising, or at least was in some way involved in the tax returns when they were being finalized for '93, but that was part of the blind trust work, as I recall.

<P>Q:  Your own tax returns?

<P>A:  Yes.

<P>Q:  Was he doing work, to your knowledge, with respect to the filing of the Whitewater tax returns?

<P>A:  Not that I know of, no.



It is unclear whether Mrs. Clinton's answer to Mr. Fiske's question encompassed Mr. Foster's work on the Clintons' personal returns relating to their tax liability for Whitewater.  In her interview with the FBI, Ms. Seidman reported that she attended meetings with the Clintons' personal lawyers at Williams & Connolly on the treatment of the 1992 sale of Whitewater on the Clintons' 1993 tax returns.

    11 The Special Committee on September 15, 1995, issued a subpoena to Bell Atlantic requesting identification of the person or entity registered to that number.  On September 27, 1995, the phone company replied with records indicating that the number was not registered as in service on July 20, 1993.  After additional review, Bell Atlantic advised the Special Committee on November 28, 1995, that it was unable to determine to whom 202-628-7087 was registered in July 1993.  Representatives of the telephone company speculated that the number may have been an auxiliary number for which it did not maintain separate billing records, or that the number may have been confidentially assigned to the White House for secured use.  Similarly, the White House advised the Special Committee on November 15 and November 28, 1995, that it was unable to identify the person whom Mrs. Clinton called on July 20, 1993.



    12 On December 5, 1995, Chairman D'Amato wrote to the White House that "[t]he Special Committee now has reason to believe that the number may have been used by the White House Communications Agency as a secure telephone line."  

    13 However, a Park Police report of an interview with Mr. Nussbaum on July 22, 1993, noted that Mr. Nussbaum stated the search for a suicide note with Patsy Thomasson lasted from 2200 hours to 2400 hours.  Park Police Document 29.

    14 Mr. Nussbaum testified that although he does not remember, he "might have gotten up and walked out and come back."  Nussbaum, 7/12/95 Dep. p. 38.

    15 The only possible exception may be the brief moment when, according to Ms. Thomasson, Ms. Williams left and Mr. Nussbaum entered the office for the second time.

    16 The standard procedure for the cleaning staff was to exit whenever a White House staff member enters his or her office.  S. Hrg. 7/26/95 p. 13.

    17 Officer O'Neill initially did not know who Ms. Thomasson was, but later identified her.  O'Neill, 7/26/95 Hrg. p. 19.

    18  Ms. Williams' attorney submitted an affidavit stating that he "arranged to have Ms. Williams polygraphed" by a private polygrapher.  Anderson, 7/31/95 Dep. Exh. 1.  The affidavit represented that this private "examination confirmed that Ms. Williams was truthful in her assertion that she did not remove any documents from Mr. Foster's office on the night of his death."  Anderson, 7/31/95 Dep. Exh. 1.  After receiving the favorable results from her private polygrapher, Ms. Williams then offered to submit to a polygraph examination on the same subject by the Office of the Independent Counsel.  According to Ms. Williams' attorney, the Independent Counsel's polygrapher advised him at the conclusion of the test that "Ms. Williams was truthful in her assertion that she did not remove any documents from Mr. Foster's office on the night of his death."  Anderson, 7/31/95 Dep. Exh. 1.



    19 Mr. Nussbaum explained that, although he locked and alarmed the suite, he did not remember calling the Secret Service to report that he had done so.  Thus, "you can lock the office and turn on the alarm without making that call.  And if you do it without making that call, they may get, the Secret Service log may get the wrong name."  Nussbaum, 8/10/95 Hrg. p. 125.  This explanation is unpersuasive.  It fails to explain why Officer O'Neill was identified on Secret Service logs as the person who set the alarm in the Counsel's suite -- a position consistent with Officer O'Neill's testimony.

    20 The report was written and submitted to the Director of the FBI on July 22, 1993.  Although it is not possible from the time stamp on the document to determine whether the report was received at around 9:00 in the morning or in the evening of July 22, the text of the report makes clear that it was written prior to any FBI activity at the White House on July 22.

    21 The notes were dictated in July 1993 and typed up later.  Monaco, 7/6/95 Dep. pp. 26-27.

<P>22 Ms. Gorham actually testified that, to the best of her recollection, this incident occurred the week after Mr. Foster's funeral.  Gorham, 8/1/95 Hrg. p. 16.  

<P>23 Mr. Heymann's view finds support from independent commentators.  See, e.g., Jeffrey K. Shapiro, Bernard Nussbaum's Novel View of Privilege, Washington Times, August 30, 1995, p. A15; Lester Brickman, Foster's Paper: What Executive Privilege? New York Times, August 2, 1995, p. A19. 

<P>24 It has been reported, however, that a panel of experts--including a forensics authority from Oxford University--concluded that the note was not in Mr. Foster's hand.  See, e.g., Christopher Ruddy, "Experts Say Foster `Suicide' Note Forged," Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, Oct. 25, 1995.  Because the White House and the Foster family's attorney did not provide the Special Committee with obtain original samples of Mr. Foster's handwriting, the Special Committee was not able to conduct an investigation into this matter.

<P>25 After providing this testimony, Mr. Nussbaum consulted with counsel.  When the deposition resumed, Mr. Nussbaum revised his testimony:  "As I indicated in my testimony, look back at the record, I'm not certain I even had this discussion with Ms. Williams.  I'm not positive.  It's either Ms. Williams or Mr. Neuwirth I had a discussion with."  Nussbaum, 7/13/95 Dep. p. 409.

After the note was turned over to law enforcement authorities, Mr. Heymann referred it to the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) and the Criminal Division of the Justice Department with the following directive: 



<P>I would like OPR to review the assertion in the notes dealing with he FBI and to give me its recommendation as to what, if any, further inquiry is necessary and appropriate.  I would like the Criminal Division to review the other assertions in the notes and to give me its recommendation as to what, if any, further inquiry is necessary and appropriate. 



Justice Department Document D 000057.

<P>27 Entry and exit records for the White House and the Residence indicate that July 27 was the only day in the week following Mr. Foster's death when Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Thomases, and Mr. Hubbell were in the White House or the Residence together.

<P>28 A later FBI analysis of the pieces of the note concluded:  "The specimens were examined and one latent palm print of value was developed on one piece of paper, part of Q1."  Justice Department Document FBI-00000079.  The latent palm print is unidentified.  

<P>29 During debates on the bill, sponsored by Senators Hatch, Simon, and Dodd, one senator noted that polygraph tests are "not much better than a toss of the coin in many instances." (134 Cong. Rec. S1794, S1800 (March 3, 1988)).  Others observed that "[l]ie detectors are inherently unreliable," (134 Cong. Rec. S1713, S1737 (March 2, 1988)) and that "polygraph tests cannot accurately distinguish truthful statement from lies." (134 Cong. Rec. S1638, S1647 (March 1, 1988)).  

<P>30 Louis I. Rovner, "The Accuracy of Physiological Detection of Deception for Subjects with Prior Knowledge," 15 Polygraph p. 1 (1986).

<P>31 The White House identified the telephone extension which Thomases called as that of Margaret Williams and her assistant, Evelyn Lieberman.  Ms. Williams, however, testified that the extension is the general number for her office, to which a number of other individuals had access.  Williams, 7/26/95 Hrg. p. 233.  The White House later advised the Special Committee that all individuals who had access to that extension did not recall talking to Thomases on July 22, 1993.  Letter from Jane Sherburne to Michael Chertoff and Richard Ben-Veniste, August 4, 1995; Letter from Jane Sherburne to Robert Giuffra, August 6, 1995; Letter from Jane Sherburne to Robert Giuffra, August 8, 1995.  Both Ms. Lieberman and Ms. Williams testified that they likewise did not recall talking with Ms. Thomases.  Williams, 7/7/95 Dep. p. 58.  Ms. Thomases, however, testified that she recalled having conversations with Ms. Williams on July 21 and 22.  Thomases, 7/17/95 Dep. p. 109.

<P>32 At a press conference on April 22, 1994, Mrs. Clinton was asked whether Margaret Williams was among those who removed documents from Foster's office.  She replied: "I don't think that she did remove any documents."  White House Document Z 000107.  On August 2, 1994, Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers affirmed Mrs. Clintons's statement: "I think that it is true that Maggie didn't remove any documents from Vince's office; they were removed by Bernie Nussbaum."  White House Document Z 000578.  

<P>33<P> Similarly, when asked by the RTC-IG about this same February 2, 1994, meeting, Mr. Ickes testified: "Mr. Altman, as I recall, raised the issue of the upcoming--the possible--well, not the possible, but the fact that the statute of limitations, which I knew nothing about at the time, of the RTC in connection with an investigation that was apparently being conducted by the RTC on Madison Whitewater was about to expire."  (Ickes, 7/15/94 RTC Dep. p. 7).  Mr. Ickes emphasized that White House officials had no knowledge of the statute of limitations issue:  "There were questions about the statute of limitations, when it expired, under what conditions it expired.  I don't think anybody in the room other than Mr. Altman and Ms. Hanson had a clear picture of what the statute of limitations situation was."  (Ickes, 7/15/94 RTC Dep. p. 8).



<P>34<P> Mr. Kendall based this assertion on the fact that Mr. Denton testified at two trials, Ward v. Madison Guaranty, and United States v. McDougal et al., yet did not mention his April 7, 1986 telephone conversation with Mrs. Clinton.  Mr. Kendall, however, offered no indication whether Mr. Denton was asked questions about his conversations with Mrs. Clinton or, for that matter, whether such conversations and Mrs. Clinton's work for Madison were within the scope of the trials. (Letter from David Kendall to Senator Alfonse D'Amato, 6/17/96 p. 2)



<P>What is clear, however, is that Mr. Denton recalled the conversation only after being shown Mrs. Clinton's billing records refelcting the 12 minute telephone call on April 7.  When he was shown this record, on June 3, 1996, he did not recall the conversation.  However, after the interview, he reviewed his files and discovered the April 7 message slip from Mrs. Clinton.  His memory thus refreshed, he provided additional testimony to the FDIC-IG, all under a legal obligation of truthfulness, 18 U.S.C.  1001.  (Denton, FDIC-IG Report of Interview, June 11, 1996.)  Mr. Denton has no reason to mislead investigators, much less to go out of his way to give inaccurate testimony.

<P>35<P> On June 13, 1996, the Special Committee requested that Mrs. Clinton respond in writing, under oath, about "any knowledge she may have concerning the Rose Law Firm billing records bearing Bates Stamp numbers DKSN028928 through DKSN029043, including whether she has reviewed, handled, or discussed (other than with counsel) these records, and her knowledge relating to the disappearance or discovery of the records."



<P>On June 17, 1996, Mrs. Clinton responded: "I do not know how the billing records (DKSN028928 through DKSN029043) came to be identified by Mrs. Huber at the White House on January 4, 1996, although I have read various media accounts."  In light of the Special Committee's request for detailed and specific information relating to any knowledge she had concerning their disappearance or discovery, Mrs. Clinton's answer is incomplete.  For example, she does not state whether she has any knowledge as to how the billing records were removed from the Rose Law Firm; who possessed the billing records between February 1992 and August 1995; where they were stored between February 1992 and August 1995; and, most importantly, who placed them in the Book Room of the White House in August 1995.  There is no mystery as to how Ms. Huber came to identify the records on January 4, 1996.  These other, more important questions, however, remain to be answered.



<P>Mrs. Clinton's incomplete response, therefore, does not alter the Special Committee's conclusion.

<P>36<P> Another suspect identified in the referral, Larry Kuca, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of conspiracy to misapply funds.

<P>37<P> The RTC's Professional Liability Section was responsible for handling civil claims relating to the legal liability of professionals, such as accountants, appraisers, and attorneys.  (Lewis, 10/30/95 Dep. p. 125.) 

<P>38<P> Ms. Lewis testified that she did not intend to record the conversation initially.  She testified that the tape recorder turned itself on, and that at some point during the conversation she noticed that it was on but chose to continue the recording.  (Lewis, 10/30/95 Dep. pp. 157-158, 196-197.)  



<P>Ms. Breslaw was unaware that the conversation was being recorded.  (Breslaw, 11/30/95 Hrg. p. 69.)



<P>Ms. Lewis turned the original tape over to the Office of the Independent Counsel ("OIC") on March 31, 1994.  (Lewis, 10/30/95 Dep. p. 241.)  The OIC produced a copy of the tape to the Special Committee on November 20, 1995.   

<P>39<P> Ms. Lewis testified that because she believed "there was an effort underway to control, manipulate and even obstruct the Madison investigation," she met with Rep. Leach on February 18, 1994, and played the tape for him.  (Lewis, 11/29/95 Hrg. p. 23); (Lewis, 10/30/95 Dep. p. 236.)



<P>40<P> In prior testimony, Mr. Ryan has stated that he has no recollection of indicating to anyone at the RTC that he would prefer to be able to say that Whitewater did not cause losses to Madison.  (Ryan, 6/21/95 Dep. p. 42.)  Ms. Kulka has also testified that she never indicated to Ms. Breslaw that she would prefer to be able to say that Whitewater did not cause a loss to Madison.  (Kulka, 6/23/95 Dep. p. 31.)

<P>41<P> Patrick I. Noble, the former Deputy Assistant Inspector General for the RTC, testified that Mr. Adair advised him of this conversation.  (Noble, 10/20/95 Dep. pp. 33-34.)  Mr. Noble recalled that Mr. Adair had said that "it was not appropriate for the Inspector General's office to search those offices, and I believe he said he didn't believe there was any basis for that."  (Noble, 10/20/95 Dep. p. 28.)  Mr. Noble added that Mr. Adair's response was that a search would have been "[i]nappropriate in the sense [that] there was no legal basis for it."  (Noble, 10/20/95 p.28).

<P>42<P> On August 17 and 19, 1993, approximately two weeks before his meeting with Ms. Casey, Mr. Coleman discussed with Associate White House Counsel William Kennedy the federal investigation of Mr. Hale.  (Coleman, 11/9/95 Dep. pp. 63-65; Coleman, 12/1/95 Hrg. pp. 10-16; Kennedy, 12/05/95 Hrg. pp. 11-16).  



<P>Mr. Kennedy's contemporaneous notes of the two conversations clearly indicate that Mr. Coleman mentioned President Clinton, Mr. Tucker, Madison Guaranty, Whitewater, Southloop and Castle Grande.  This documentary evidence adds further credibility to Mr. Coleman's version of the September 7, 1993 meeting.

<P>43<P> Q: Well, when you pulled the referral, you saw that the referral, in fact, had not been acted upon in Washington but had been returned to Little Rock for purposes of a final decision; correct?



<P>A: No, that's not the way I look at it--my view of that at the time was that it had been acted upon in the sense that it had been reviewed and that the opinion of the Department was it was not a good referral and should not be prosecuted.  But that decision had never been relayed to RTC.



<P>Q: Didn't the memo actually indicate that although there would be no objection if the Little Rock office declined prosecution, it was to be a decision left in the hands of the Little Rock U.S. Attorney's office?



<P>A: That's what--that was--after I pulled Keeney's memo back out that was what I saw in his memo.



<P>Q: So you understood?

<P>

<P>A: Would not question the decision to decline, but there was no reason for the office to be recused.

<P>

<P>Q: So it became your decision; right?

<P>

<P>A: Yes.(Casey, 11/01/95 Dep. p. 183).

<P>45<P> Mr. Kennedy claimed that Mr. Nussbaum did not instruct him to speak with Mr. Hubbell, and that he did not report back to Mr. Nussbaum his conversation with Mr. Hubbell.  (Kennedy, 12/5/95 Hrg. p. 104.)

<P>46<P> Mr. Blair's memory lapse, however, appeared to be selective because he did recall other portions of his alleged conversation with Mr. Heuer.  (Blair, 11/20/95 Dep. 11-14.)  Mr. Blair also recalled another conversation with Mr. Heuer, most likely prior to Mr. Hale's indictment, in which Mr. Heuer informed him that "Hale had supposedly been to see McDougal and tried to get McDougal to lie about various things that Hale wanted to claim was reality."  (Blair, 11/20/95 Dep. p. 13)  This other conversation between Mr. Blair and Mr. Heuer corresponds to a separate entry in the same page of Mr. Lindsey's notes. (Hogan & Hartson Document BL011718-011722.)

<P>47<P> One margin note stated: "BC has no recollection."  Willkie, Farr & Gallagher Document ST000047.

<P>48   The notes appear as follows in the White House's typed version of Mr. Kennedy's notes: 



"III.<P>RTC referral w/r/t McDougal

<P>4/85 BC personally

<P>3 checks written on Madison--all $3,000

Later, his notes reflect the following entry: 



"Charles Peacock - proceeds went from Charles 

<P><P>for Clinton campaign - 85

<P><P>Charles Peacock (Ken Peacock?) 



$1500 per election - $3,000 



<P><P>Primary and general." (White House Document S12534).

<P>49   At the very beginning of Mr. Kennedy's notes appears the following entry: 



"HRC representation of Madison - not much activity representing 

people before agencies   

2 RLF letters Beverly Bassett

Later, in his notes, there is an entry related to the Rose Law Firm's retainer: 



"+ RLF - Madison Guaranty - Retainer at $2,000 per month  



<P>ANN + Check drawn on WWDC - payable to HRC  



<P>Bernie + Believe that it believes prob. represents

<P>[15 months for $2,000 per month - Retainer]

<P>50  Mr. Kennedy's notes show: 



"Blair could have knowledge  

  Could be source of money 

  to allow McD to purchase stock." (White House Document S12531.)  



On the same page, the following entry appears: 

"3/4 Times<P> Heuer<P> Blair contact

<P><P>2/3, 1992<P>Have 1

<P>51<P> Mr. Kennedy's notes read: 



"Not Reconstruction - 

<P>$11,000 -



Clinton not released until Fall of 1992 



Blair up - Chris Wade." (White House Document S12537).  



Although Mr. Wade assumed the McDougal's interest in Whitewater in 1985, the Clintons were not released from their obligation until the balance of the debt was paid off.

<P>52<P> The following entry appears in Mr. Kennedy's notes: 



"Report:<P> Clinton had taken the deductions that WWDC had not 

<P><P>taken  

<P><P>Tax advantage of $2500  

<P><P>Not repay government yet promise." (White House Document S12529).

<P>53<P> Mr. Kennedy's notes indicate the following discussion: 



"End of '86 - asked for records

<P>Corp records to HRC

<P>Make a more complete reconstruction." (White House Document S012533-S012534.)<BR>

     54      After Mr. Hale's allegations against the President was made public, the Capital Management investigation predictably attracted considerable attention.  On November 4, 1993, Congressman John LaFalce, the Chairman of the House Committee on Small Business, wrote to Mr. Bowles and requested "a full written report on Capital Management Services, Inc., including its licensing, private capital, ownership, SBA leverage, and individual financings made, including profit and loss statements." (SBA Document Not numbered).  In addition, Chairman LaFalce asked that the SBA provide, under section 10(e) of the Small Business Act, the staff director and counsel of the Committee on Small Business with copies of the SBA's files on Capital Management. (SBA Document Not numbered).<BR>

     55      Instead of sending someone connected with the White House, the defense team discussed sending John Tisdale, Mr. Lindsey's former law partner; Skip Rutherford, a 1992 Clinton presidential official who continued to informally assist the White House regarding public relations aspects of Whitewater; a New York lawyer friend of Paul Begala; and Jack Quinn, Chief of Staff to Vice President Gore.  (Rutherford, 2/29/96 Dep., pp. 5-10, 21-23; White House Document S020577.)<BR>

     56      Mr. Ickes notes of the Whitewater Response Team tasking memorandum included the task of researching whether the President used pressure to aid Madison Guaranty--one of the issues involving Ms. Schaffer's actions. (Ickes, 2/22/96, Hrg. pp. 86-87.)<BR>

     57   In addition to contacts with persons from Arkansas, the Schaffers attended a movie at the White House on January 28, 1994 at 8:30 p.m.  Attendees included, among others, the President, the First Lady, Mr. Lindsey, and Paul Berry, a close friend and confidant of the President.  Mr. Berry was also a close friend of the Schaffers and has known the Bassett family since the early 1950s.  (Berry, 5/10/96, Dep. p. 59.)<BR>

     58      Mr. Wade produced documents to the Special Committee, but exercised his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when the Special Committee sent him a subpoena ad testificandum.<BR>

     59      Meanwhile, Frank Burge, James Patterson, and Robert Ritter, all of whom were Presidents of Citizen's Bank of Flippin ("Citizen's Bank") at one time during the existence of the Whitewater loan, provided substantial testimony to the Special Committee on the initial Whitewater loan made by Citizen's Bank.  Mr. Burge testified that the Clintons and the McDougals never notified Citizen's Bank that the $20,000 down payment on the Whitewater loan was borrowed from another bank, Union National Bank, and, thus, Citizen's Bank was not aware that the Clintons and McDougals invested no money into the original mortgage. (Burge, 5/8/96 Hrg. pp. 19-20.)<BR></P>



<P>     Mr. Ritter testified that he had two meetings with Mrs. Clinton between 1979 and 1982 about the Whitewater mortgage.  Mr. Ritter testified that Mrs. Clinton asked several questions about the loans and interest rates and seemed quite knowledgeable about the transaction. (Ritter, 5/8/96 Hrg. pp. 34-35.)<BR></P>



<P>     Paul Berry and Donald Denton, Senior Vice Presidents of Union National Bank, also provided illuminating testimony to the Special Committee.  Mr. Berry testified that President Clinton approached him about making the $20,000 loan for the down payment on the Whitewater property.  Mr. Denton testified that either Mr. Berry, or another bank official, instructed him to make the $20,000 unsecured loan--against his better judgment. (Denton, 5/8/96 Hrg. p. 66.)<BR></P>



<P>     After the discovery of the Rose Law Firm billing records in the White House Residence in January 1996, the FDIC Inspector General reexamined Mr. Denton.  His memory refreshed, Mr. Denton specifically recalled an April 7, 1986 telephone conversation with Mrs. Clinton relating to Castle Grande, a sham transaction.  During the conversation, Mr. Denton cautioned Mrs. Clinton that the transaction may pose a problem because they could violate an Arkansas banking regulation.  According to Mr. Denton, Mrs. Clinton "summarily dismissed" Mr. Denton's warning.  She replied in a manner he took to mean that "he would take care of savings and loan matters, and she would take care of legal matters." (Denton, 6/11/96 FDIC-OIG Interview, p. 3.)<BR>

     60      Mr. Eggleston incorrectly identified March 2, 1989, as the date on which the statute of limitations began to run for Madison-related civil claims.  The RTC was appointed conservator of Madison on February 28, 1989, and actual intervention occurred on March 2, 1989.  The statute of limitations began to run on "the date of the appointment of the Corporation as conservator or receiver."  12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(14)(B)(i) (1995).<BR>

     61   Phone logs kept by Mr. Cutler's office indicate that Mr. Knight called Mr. Cutler on July 15, 1994 and that Mr. Cutler spoke with Mr. Knight on July 18, July 20, July 21 and July 22.  (White House Documents S007922, S007923, S007924, S007928 and S007929.)<BR>

     62 In addition, Ms. Sherburne first requested that White House attorneys be able to sit in on OIG depositions.  Ms. Black strongly opposed this suggestion, because she wanted to keep the investigation independent, and she stated, "if we agreed to have them (the White House Counsel) sitting in on the interviews, that would be contrary to our standard method of conducting investigations."  (Black, 10/12/95 Dep. 77.)  Ms. Black stated that "although we conduct all investigations by the book, this one, above all other investigations, had to be conducted by the book in order to give any validity to whatever we found.  (Black, 10/12/95 Dep. p. 62.)  <BR>

     63 The summaries were prepared when the OGC knew that the IG objected to the transfer of transcripts. (Dougherty, 11/8/95 Hrg/. p. 156.)  Mr. Cottos testified that he had not been consulted about the propriety of the summaries.(Cottos, 11/8/95 Hrg. p. 29.)  Not surprisingly, Ms. Kerner was aware that Mr. McHale and others in the OGC, were working on the summaries, and was actually given a copy of them. (Kerner, 11/8/95 Hrg. p. 29.)  Sarah Jones, a Tres. OGC attorney who worked on the team that summarized the transcripts, reported directly to John Bowman, Jean Hanson's Assistant General Counsel for Banking and Finance. (Dougherty, 11/6/95 Dep. p. 27.)  Mr. Bowman was also a fact witness in the investigation.<BR>

     64      On May 20, 1996, more than six months after he testified before the Special Committee, Mr. Cutler provided the Special Committee with a letter in which he sought to recast the sworn testimony that he gave on both August 5, 1995, before the Senate Banking Committee, and on November 9, 1995, before the Special Committee.<BR>

     65      Chairman D'Amato:  "I suggest to you that, when you come as the White House counsel and you say that informally that we have been -- we being the White House -- White House officials have the blessing of the Office of Government Ethics as it relates to no violations of any ethical standards occurred, and thereafter every -- just about every White House official comes in and waves it, that was just not accurate.<BR></P>



<P>     Mr. Cutler:  What I said in my testimony before you on August the 5th was that the OGE had reviewed the factual findings of the Treasury Inspector General and issued its formal opinion concurring that no violation of any ethical standard -- these are the so-called standards of ethical conduct for the executive branch -- occurred by any current Treasury or RTC official.  Then I said, I have reached the same conclusions as to White House officials, and based on the facts as I reported to them to this nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics, that office has informally concurred.  Now that may have been where I transgressed. (Cutler, 11/9/95 Hrg. pp. 33-34.)<BR>

     66      Mr. Kendall based this assertion on the fact that Mr. Denton testified at two trials, Ward v. Madison Guaranty, and United States v. McDougal et al., yet did not mention his April 7, 1986 telephone conversation with Mrs. Clinton.  Mr. Kendall, however, offered no indication whether Mr. Denton was asked questions about his conversations with Mrs. Clinton or, for that matter, whether such conversations and Mrs. Clinton's work for Madison were within the scope of the trials.<BR></P>



<P>     What is clear, however, is that Mr. Denton recalled the conversation only after being shown Mrs. Clinton's billing records refelcting the 12 minute telephone call on April 7.  When he was shown this record, on June 3, 1996, he did not recall the conversation.  However, after the interview, he reviewed his files and discovered the April 7 message slip from Mrs. Clinton.  His memory thus refreshed, he provided additional testimony to the FDIC-IG, all under a legal obligation of truthfulness, 18 U.S.C.  1001.  (Denton, FDIC-IG Report of Interview, June 11, 1996.)  Mr. Denton has no reason to mislead investigators, much less to go out of his way to give inaccurate testimony.<BR>

     67      The Rose Law Firm resisted the RTC OIG's investigation.  After Rose declined a request to provide client identity information, the OIG issued a subpoena calling for the production of documents that would establish the identities of Rose's clients between 1985 and 1994.  In April 1994, Rose filed suit against the RTC and the OIG, seeking to enjoin the OIG's conflicts investigation and bar enforcement of the subpoena.  The suit was dismissed in August 1994.  In November 1994, a federal district court ordered Rose to comply with the subpoena.  See Adair v. Rose Law Firm, 867 F. Supp. 1111 (D.D.C. 1994); (RTC OIG Report p. I-1 - I-2; Black, 8/10/95 Hrg. pp. 119-121.)<BR>

     68      Susan Thomases testified that she talked with Mr. Hubbell in 1992 about Mrs. Clinton's work for Madison, and he indicated to her that he had reviewed time records.  With respect to reviewing the records herself, however, Ms. Thomases testified, "I never saw them....I never heard what happened to them."  (Thomases, 12/18/95 Hrg. pp. 54-55.)<BR>
