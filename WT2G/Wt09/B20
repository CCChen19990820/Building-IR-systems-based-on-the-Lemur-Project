     RANGOON (Reuter) - Burmese students angry over an incident involving 
     the police took their "non-political" protest to the streets on Monday and 
     demonstrated late into the night at a busy road junction.
      At least 1,500 students marched three miles (five km) in the afternoon 
     from the Yangon (Rangoon) Institute of Technology (YIT) to the front gates 
     of Rangoon University.
     <p>
     After sunset more than 1,000 of them marched to a nearby intersection 
     singing the Burmese national anthem and carrying banners saying "We 
     don't want unfair government" and continued the demonstration there, 
     disrupting traffic.
     <p>
     "This is not political. We simply want to make known our demand for 
     justice and human rights," a young student told Reuters.
     Another student leader said earlier that the protesters were not 
     linked to any political party and they had no intention of politicising the 
     protest.
<p>
     The demonstrators are angered over police handling of a brawl in 
     October between YIT students and restaurant owners. The students accuse police 
     of unfair treatment after three students were temporarily arrested and 
     two ordered not to attend classes.
     <p>
     The students are also annoyed by leaflets distributed on their 
     campuses by people claiming to be students urging their classmates to improve 
     their behaviour and not to get involved in activities that could disrupt 
     their studies.
     <p>
     Student leaders earlier turned down government offers to negotiate 
     with senior education ministry officials.
      "We demanded to talk to someone with real authority like Secretary 
     One," one said, referring to Khin Nyunt of the ruling State Law and Order 
     Restoration  Council (SLORC).<p>
     
     The United States and other Western countries have accused the SLORC 
     of widespread human rights abuses and criticised its crackdown on the 
     pro-democracy movement led by Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
      Student leaders said at the height of the protest on Monday, nearly 
     2,000 of  the YIT's estimated 4,500 students took part in the demonstration, the 
     biggest since the brawl in October. 
<p>
     The protesters demanded that two students who had been barred from 
     classes after the October brawl be allowed to return to their studies.
      The students also sought a government promise that YIT would not be 
     closed because of the latest protest, YIT sources said.
     <p>
     The students demanded that authorities clarify within 24 hours whether 
     any action had been taken against police responsible for the arrests of 
     their colleagues in October.
      Although the school was not closed after the October demonstration, it 
     was
     shut for about two years following nationwide pro-democracy uprisings 
     in 1988.
     <p>
     In that year, student-led demonstrations, which the SLORC eventually 
     crushed, were sparked by a teashop brawl that incited nationwide 
     outrage
     against the military government.

     December 10, 1996 <p>
     
        RANGOON, Burma (AP) _ One day after shutting down universities
     in Rangoon, Burma's military government closed boys and coed 
     secondary schools in the capital Tuesday to quash student protests.
<p>     
     Students and riot police clashed over the weekend and on Monday. 
     Army troops were stationed at the Kyimyindine and Botataung 
     campuses of Rangoon University on Tuesday, two hot spots of student 
     protests since last week.
     <p>
     Barbed wire barricades blocked streets near the Ministry of Defense 
     and the
     capital's railway station. More were piled along the sides of main 
     roads in
     case the army decides to close them.
     <p>
        The government's failure to address the students' grievances has
     sparked street demonstrations that have mushroomed into the largest 
     show of civil dissent since 1988.
     <p>
        No students took to the streets Tuesday morning, but a statement
     by Human Rights Watch Asia, an international human rights group, 
     said that protests had spread to Mandalay, Burma's second largest 
     city.
     <p>
     Both the Institute of Medicine and the Institute of Technology
     in Mandalay were shut down by the government on Sunday following 
     demonstrations there, the group said.
     <p>
     On Tuesday, she was permitted to meet with leaders of her political 
     party at
     her home. Seven members of her party were arrested over the weekend on 
     suspicion of taking part in the demonstrations, Human Rights Watch 
     Asia said.
     <p>
     On Monday, riot police chased hundreds of student protesters 
     through the streets of Rangoon. Hundreds more from Dagon University 
     across the Rangoon River, attempting to reach the site of the 
     protests by buses, were turned back by troops.
     <p>
     Late at night, troops also chased people gathered at a downtown 
     Rangoon intersection near the medical school. Students could be 
     heard chanting their demands from inside a school dormitory.
          Witnesses saw no arrests, but many said they had fled before the 
     troops and so were uncertain if anyone had been taken into custody.
     <p>
     Attempts to reach government spokesmen have been unsuccessful. 
     Intelligence officers detained an Agence France Presse reporter who had been 
     following the demonstrations and interrogated him for four hours, seizing his 
     film.
     <p>
     At least three freelance journalists have been deported by the 
     authorities
     as they search for whoever has been filming the student demonstrations 
     for
     Cable News Network. A Japanese journalist and his Burmese reporter 
     were
     badly beaten
     by police last week.

Friday, Students from RIT (Rangoon Institute of Technology) and 
Dagon university started to assemble this morning and marched to 
the Thamai intersection. All the workers from Thamai Textile 
factory and citizens cheered the students up. All the main roads
leading to Rangoon main university campus have been blocked by the Slorc 
military personals.
<p>     
All the students and citizens are nearly 10,000 now, said the 
diplomats in Rangoon. 
     <p>
At the moment, all the demonstrators are gathering at Hle Tan 
intersection. Their demands are become more political than the demands two 
days ago, said the witnesses in Rangoon.
     <p>
Three days ago, U Tin Oo, vice-chairman of the NLD was 
investigated for two hours by the military intelligence in his 
residence.
     <p>
On Thursday, more than 500 NLD members and political activists 
went to U Tin Oo's compound to celebrate National Day because all 
the ways to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's residence was blocked by the 
Slorc security personals. Finally, Slorc soldiers and riot police 
came to U Tin Oo's house and warned them to disperse immediately.
     <p>
Friday morning, the foreign Oil companies in Rangoon have made 
some interviews with local people who want to get in oil 
companies and will start their business in coming March or April, 
said residents in Rangoon.

<p>

November 20. 1996
 
     Near the central market in Rangoon stands the Traders Hotel, the 
     latest and tallest addition to the Burmese
     capital's skyline. 
     
     To some, the building is a good example of the new vibrancy unleashed 
     by economic reforms, which have
     transformed this capital from a sleepy ex-colonial backwater to a 
     modestly booming city. For others however,
     the edifice is also a dark reminder of the power and influence 
     exercised by the country's drug lords. 
 <p>    
     The Traders project is backed by one of the country's most important 
     businessmen, who is the son of the
     former "king" of Southeast Asia's opium-producing region known as the 
     Golden Triangle. Investment in the
     Traders project is alleged to be financed by the family drug business, 
     a charge that carries enough weight
     that it was reportedly used by the State Department as the reason for 
     denying him a US visa. 
     <p>
     Burma's most infamous drug kingpin, Khun Sa, surrendered to Burmese 
     authorities nearly a year ago, along
     with his rebel Mong Tai Army (MTA). The hope was that his withdrawal 
     would be followed by the capture of
     additional kingpins and a crackdown on the drug trade in Burma, the 
     world's largest producer of opium and
     the source for two-thirds of the heroin seized on US streets. 
     <p>
     The evidence to date suggests no such development. According to the 
     United Nations International Drug
     Control Program (UNDCP), a substantial reduction has taken place in 
     the amount of heroin trafficked to and
     through northern Thailand over the first half of this year from former 
     MTA-held areas. However, a concurrent
     increase has been registered in the amount of Burmese-produced heroin 
     trafficked into China, reflected in
     the increasing number of seizures by Chinese authorities along the 
     Burmese border. "As far as trafficking is
     concerned, nothing is ever static," argues Vincent McClean, head of 
     UNDCP's office in Bangkok.
     <p>
     Burma's market reforms have also allowed money earned from the drug 
     trade to be poured into legitimate
     businesses. A report issued by the US Embassy in Rangoon last July 
     noted that the value of potential opium
     exports from Burma may be equal to the country's entire earnings from 
     legally exported goods and services.
     Repatriation of drug earnings has been facilitated by Burma's policy 
     of welcoming investment without
     scrutiny of the original source of the funds. 
     <p>
     The booming hotel sector may be the most visible example of 
     "narcofinancing" in action in Burma, now
     called Myanmar. Despite predictions of a short-term glut in Rangoon, 
     new accommodations in the capital
     continue to be built. Some hotels "are being built with funds from 
     individuals and organizations that have had
     close ties to opiate-growing or opiate-exporting organizations," the 
     report continues.
     <p>
     Meanwhile, what of Khun Sa, who was indicted in December 1989 by a 
     federal grand jury in New York on 10
     drug trafficking counts? The man once described by former US 
     Attorney-General Dick Thornburgh as the
     "prince of death" appears to be enjoying a comfortable retirement 
     under the care of Burma's military
     government in a villa in Rangoon. 
     <p>
     Whatever deal the generals may have struck with him to secure his 
     surrender remains a mystery, but it
     appears to rule out extradition to the US. 
     
     "If he's being treated like a prisoner, it seems to be first-class 
     treatment," says a diplomat here. "He's not
     being kept in an unlit, concrete cell."

<b>November 26, 1996</b><p>
     
    <b> BANGKOK, Thailand </b>(UPI)<br> President Clinton Tuesday accused 
     Burma
     of being the No. 1 producer of opium and heroin, and he added it is 
     also
     making methamphetamines.
     
     He made the remarks in an address at Chulalongkorn University, where 
     he
     praised the growth of democracy and cooperation in other Asian 
     countries,
     particularly Thailand.
     
     ``We know we must do more to fight illegal drugs at the source,'' 
     Clinton
     said. ``Burma has long been the world's number one producer of opium 
     and
     heroin and now is also making methamphetamines.
     
     ``The role of drugs in Burma's economic and political life and the 
     regime's
     refusal to honor its own pledge to move to multi-party democracy are 
     really
     two sides of the same coin, for both represent the absence of the rule 
     of
     law,'' he added.
     
     ``Every nation has an interest in promoting true political dialogue in 
     Burma
     a dialogue that will lead to a real fight against crime, corruption 
     and
     narcotics and a government more acceptable to its people, '' he said.
     <p>
     Clinton said that the extensive cooperation between the United States 
     and
     Thailand in the area of law enforcement is ``clearly paying off.''
     
     ``In 1994,'' he recalled, ``Operation Tiger Trap dealt a crippling 
     blow to a
     major trafficking network in Burma, enabling the arrest of 14 
     kingpins, two
     of who have now been extradited to the United States.''
     <p>
     He told the university audience Thailand ``is sending a clear signal 
     to drug
     lords: We will fight you. We are determined to stop you.
     
     ``And,'' he said, ``Anerica has a clear signal to Thailand: We will 
     stand
     with you all the way.''
     <p>
     Singling out Burma for its repressive government was a twist for the 
     president, who on his journey to Australia, the Philippines and 
     Thailand has
     praised the growth and economic development, as well as progress 
     toward
     democracy in those countries.
     <p>
     Most of Clinton's remarks in his address dealt with the U.S. policy in 
     the
     Pacific Rim nations and determination to remain a power in the region.

     December 5, 1996<br>
     Rangoon, Agencies<p>
     
     Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi remained in her compound 
     yesterday after authorities warned they could not guarantee her 
     security she left home. The warning amounted to-an order 
     restricting Mrs Suu Kyi's movements n the wake of the largest 
     protest  critical of the State Law and Order Restoration Council 
     (Slorc) in years. It came less than a month after a mob, 
     allegedly organised by the government attacked her, car.
     <p>
     Mrs Suu Kyi protested against her confinement by the military 
     regime, labelling the move illegal. She was restricted her home 
     on Tuesday following demonstrations by students of the Yangon 
     Institute of Technology  in Rangoon.
     
     "We will make it known to the authorities that we protest this 
     illegal confinement. Every time there is a demonstration some 
     people always take it as their job to put up roadblocks," Mrs Suu 
     Kyi told Reuters. 
     <p>
     She said she believed the confinement was imposed because the 
     student protests on Monday and early Tuesday made Slorc feel the 
     situation was volatile.
     
     "But the volatile situation has nothing to do with me or the National 
     League
     for Democracy (NLD), she said, referring to her pro-democracy  party 
     which
     won elections in 1990 by a landslide but has never been allowed to 
     rule.    
     <p>
     Mrs Suu Kyi denied any  links between the student protests and 
     the NLD, but noted that there was a "moral tie" between the 
     students' cause and that of her organisation as both sought 
     justice and human rights. 
     <p>
     While authorities continued to maintain she was free, NLD party 
     covice chairman Tin Oo denounced her confinement as "virtual 
     house arrest".           
     <p>
     At 7 p.m. on Tuesday Mrs Suu  Kyi demanded that she be permitted 
     to meet with party president Aung Shwe, and co-vice chairman Kyi 
     Maung and Tin Oo
     
     "If you don't fulfil my wish I will rush through and go and see 
     them myself," he quoted the Nobel Peace laureate as saying before 
     the meeting was allowed.
     <p>
     Major Hla Min of the military's office of  strategic Studies said 
     authorities had simply requested that Aung San Suu Kyi stay 
     inside her house "for her own safety."
     
     "She was requested not to go out because of what is happening out 
     side," Hla Min said.
     
     "Yesterday she complied, but if she wished to go out, it's her 
     own choice."
     <p>
     Hundreds of students Monday began the most  defiant protest in
          Burma since the ruling junta took power in 1988, marching through 
     Rangoon demanding students' rights, before they were forcibly 
     bundled into trucks by hundreds  of riot police early on Tuesday 
     morning.
     
     All 609 demonstrators, including 487 students and 122 
     non-students, were released Tuesday afternoon after an identity 
     check, said Hla Min. Witnesses had estimated that  as many as 700 
     people had been taken away.
     <p>
     While Rangoon remained quiet yesterday, diplomatic sources said 
     that students believed some of the demonstrators were still being 
     held, though they added that such reports were unconfirmed.
     
     Students were at the forefront of the pro-democracy 
     demonstrations in 1988 that were crushed by the military, after 
     which the ruling junta called the State Law and Order Restoration 
     Council (Slorc) came to power.
     <p>
     Analysts said the  demonstration  had been a stronger expression 
     of general discontent with Burma's political and social system 
     than the sit-down protest held soon after the October incident.

Food Prices Soar in Rangoon after Unrest</h1></td>      
</table>      

  RANGOON, Burma (Reuter) - Panic buying after this month's  
student unrest in the Burmese capital has sent prices of food 
staples rocketing at least 10 percent, residents said Monday. 
  Prices jumped after retailers took advantage of a sudden  
surge in demand while tight security upset cargo flows from the 
provinces, they told Reuters.
<p> 
  Local analysts and residents estimated prices, most notably  
of rice, meat and fish, had risen by at least 10 percent across 
the board and hit the poor the hardest. <p>
  Earlier this month, university students launched the largest  
anti-government street protests seen in Rangoon since the 
pro-democracy uprisings of 1988 which the military crushed 
leaving thousands dead or in jail. <p>
  The ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC)  
briefly detained more than 860 protesters this month. The 
students were demanding greater freedom and rights and 
protesting against police brutality. <p>
  The government, determined to stop the demonstrations  
growing into civil unrest, closed universities, placed five army 
tanks outside Rangoon city hall and stationed troops around the 
capital. 
   Witnesses and diplomats said the show of force had been  
effective. Students have not taken to the streets since. 
  Rangoon was calm Monday.  <p>
  According to food dealers, cargo shipments from the  
provinces into Rangoon were continuing but security blocks along 
some roads in the capital made it hard for even distribution. 
  ``The market suddenly turned into a sellers' market when  
most people rushed to buy rice out of panic,'' said Ko San Tin, 
a construction worker from Dagon Myothit, a new satellite town 
northeast of Rangoon.

</center></p>
<P><b>I</b> am somewhat embarrassed giving this speech because I am 
not an expert on dying.  Many people connected with my Project on Death in
America are much more qualified to talk about dying than I am.  But there
seems to be a kind of strange attraction on the part of professionals and
academics to hear from men of the world like myself -- businessmen, the
doers, the actors on the public stage.  At the same time, of course, many
businessmen have an exaggerated esteem for academics.  And I may well be
one of them.  So I approach this audience with some trepidation. <p>

<b>T</b>he first question I must answer, why have I sponsored a Project on
Death in America.  There are two reasons: one is very abstract, the other
very personal. <p>

<b>T</b>he abstract motivation derives from a basic insight which has been
at the root of both my money-making and my philanthropic activities and
which I have elaborated into a not-yet-properly-understood philosophical
theory.  The insight is that there is always a divergence between the
views and ideas that guide people in their actions and the actual state of
affairs.  I call the divergence the participants bias.  Since the
participants actions help shape reality, there is a two-way feedback
mechanism between the participants bias and the events in which they
participate. I call this two-way feedback reflexivity. <p>

<b>S</b>ometimes the participants bias is quite small and there are forces
at play which tend to bring the participants views and the actual state of
affairs closer together.  But at other times the bias can be quite
enormous without any tendency to correct itself.  On the contrary, the
two-way feedback mechanism may help validate and reinforce the bias until
the situation becomes untenable and there is a reversal in the
self-reinforcing process. <p>

<b>E</b>verybody has experienced such far-from-equilibrium situations in
his life, but I have specialized in them.  I lived through Nazi
persecution in Hungary as an adolescent; then I had a taste of communism
and when I went to England I cam under the influence of Karl Popper, the
philosopher of science, and began to develop my theory of reflexivity. 
When I became involved in the financial markets I specialized on boom/bust
sequences and did rather well out of them.  And when I made more money
than I could use for my personal needs I set up a foundation devoted to
the idea of an open society.  Without going too deeply into it, open
society is based on the principle that we all act on imperfect knowledge
and nobody is in possession of the ultimate truth.  A society based on the
recognition that we may be wrong is preferable to a society which denies
that its leaders may be wrong. <p>

<b>I</b> set up foundations which tried to help open up closed societies
and I become rather intimately involved in the revolutionary process which
led from one kind of far-from-equilibrium situation to another; from the
rigidity of the Soviet System to the chaos of its collapse.  For the last
five years, I have been very busy because one can do many things in the
heat of the revolutionary moment which would be impossible in normal
times, but as the revolution began to cool off I began to think what I
could do to make our own open society more viable; because according to my
theory, open societies also suffer from deficiencies which need to be
recognized and corrected for open societies to remain viable.  I focused
on two problem areas where misconceptions played a particularly important
role, making the problems worse than they would be if they were better
understood. <p>

<b>O</b>ne is the problem of dying which I will talk about tonight.  The 
other is the problem of drugs where the remedy is worse than the disease.<p>

<b>D</b>ue to our imperfect understanding, our actions have unintended 
consequences.  Nowhere are they more glaring than in the war on drugs.  
By treating drug abuse as a crime we have created crime, corruption and 
violence which are much more destructive than drug abuse by itself.  I 
should like to see the false identification between drug and crime broken 
without necessarily advocating the legalization of drugs.  A third 
problem area  I should like to do something about, but I don't yet know 
how, is the distortion of our electoral process by the excessive use of 
TV advertising.  All three areas have one thing in common:  Distortions 
and misconceptions aggravate the problem.<p>

<b>I</b> chose the problem of dying as one of the areas because of some very 
personal experiences in connection with the death of my parents, both of 
whom I was very devoted to and loved dearly.<p>

<b>M</b>y father died at home in 1963.  He was terminally ill.  Although
he agreed to an operation, he didn't particularly want to survive it
because he was afraid that the combination of the illness and the
operation would invade and destroy his autonomy as a human being. 
Unfortunately, that in fact is what happened.  After the operation he had
very little time left.  I'm afraid I kind of wrote him off at that point. 
I was there when he died, yet I let him die alone.  I could see him, but I
wasn't at his bedside.  The day after he died I went into the office.  I
didn't talk about my fathers death.  So I kind of denied his dying, I
certainly didn't participate in it.  Afterwards, I read Kubler-Ross and
learned that I might have maintained contact with him if I tried.  Had I
read Kubler-Ross earlier I would have probably held his hand, because I
did love him.  I just didn't know that it might make a difference.  I
forgave myself because I did not know any better. <p>

<b>M</b>y mothers death was more recent.  She had joined the Hemlock Society 
and had at hand a means of doing away with herself.  I asked her if she 
needed my help; I offered it, although I wasn't particularly keen to do 
it.  But I would have helped her because I felt that I owed it to her.  
At the point of decision, however, she did not want to take her own life, 
and I'm glad she didn't.  Her decision gave the family a chance to rally 
around and be there as she prepared to die.  And this time we did 
maintain good contact right to the end.<p>

<b>S</b>he had this experience, which is described in Kubler-Ross, of
walking up to the gates of heaven, and I was accompanying her.  She told
me she was worried that she might drag me with her.  So I reassured her
that I was firmly ensconced on this earth and she should not worry.  Her
dying was really a very positive experience for all of us because of the
way she handled herself and the way the family, not just me but
particularly my children, could participate in it. <p>

<b>T</b>hese two personal experiences made me realize that there is a need
to better understand the experience of dying.  In my initial research in
the issue I was assisted by a friend, Patricia Prem, who as a social
worker had dealt professionally with dying.  She brought together the
people who helped create the Project on Death in America.  She is on the
Projects advisory board now, as are:<p>

Susan Block of Harvard Medical School,<br>
Robert Burt of Yale Law School<br>
Robert Butler of Mt. Sinai<br>
Joanne Lynn of George Washington University<br>
Velvet Miller of the New Jersey State Department of Human Resources<br>
David Rothman of Columbias College of Physicians and Surgeons<br>
Attorney William D. Zabel, and <br>
Kathleen M. Foley who is the chief of pain service at the Memorial 
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Director of the Project on Death in 
America.<p>

<b>T</b>he mission of the Project is to promote a better understanding of
the experiences of dying and bereavement and by doing so help transform
the culture surrounding death.  To do this, the Project will support
initiatives in research, scholarship, the humanities and the arts, as well
as innovations in the provision of care, public education, professional
education, and public policy.  I have committed $5 Million a year to the
Projects work for the first three years.  The board has decided to use the
money in two ways: by developing its own programs and by holding itself
open for grant applications. <p>

<b>T</b>he first major program is to establish a number of faculty 
scholarships.  We hope to identify outstanding faculty and clinicians who 
are committed to the Projects goals and to support them in their work of 
developing new models for the care of the dying and new approaches to the 
education of health professionals about the care of dying patients and 
their families.  The scholars, who will receive two- to three-year 
fellowships for projects that explore critical aspects of the care of the 
dying, will become the academic leaders on this issue, the role models, 
and mentors to future generations of health professionals.  Each year the 
project will select ten faculty scholars.  In three years we will have a 
leader and role model in place in one-fourth of the country's medical 
schools.<p>

<b>I</b>n opening up for grant applications our areas of interest are
broad enough to cover every aspect of the culture of dying.  They include
the epidemiology, ethnography, and history of dying and bereavement in the
U.S.; the physical, emotional, spiritual, and existential components of
dying and bereavement; new service-delivery models for the dying and their
family and friends; separate educational programs for the public and the
health care professionals; and the shaping of governmental and
institutional policy.  Personally I hope that the ratio between research
and action will be heavily weighed toward action. <p>

<b>N</b>ow, let us look briefly at what we want to transform and why.  We
will begin with a small matter, the name of our project.  It took a
considerable amount of discussion to rid ourselves of clever euphemisms
and settle on a name that states our purpose directly, even starkly: the
Project on Death in America.  In America, the land of perpetually young,
growing older is an embarrassment, and dying is a failure.  Death has
replaced sex as the taboo subject of our times.  People compete to appear
on talk shows to discuss the most intimate details of their sex lives, but
they have nothing to say about dying, which in its immensity dwarfs the
momentary pleasures of sex.  Only our preoccupation with violence breaks
through this shroud of silence.  Killing yes; dying no. <p>

<b>E</b>ven doctors, especially doctors, don't like to think about death.  A 
recent federal pamphlet for physicians on HIV infection never even 
mentions that AIDS is a fatal disease.  It recommends making arrangements 
for the care of the children when the patient becomes sick, but says 
nothing about the need for long-term plans for when the patient dies.  It 
is easier to find descriptions of the way people die and what can be done 
to ease their death in the medical textbooks of the turn-of-the-century 
than in today's voluminous literature on the treatment and cure of 
diseases.<p>

<b>T</b>his emphasis on treating disease, instead of providing care, has
altered the practice of medicine.  People live longer, surviving four or
five illnesses before dying.  But the health care bill grows with every
illness.  Our success has also brought other unintended consequences.  We
have created a medical culture that is so intent on curing disease and
prolonging life that it fails to provide support in that inevitable phase
of life -- death.  Advances in high technology interventions have
contributed to this weakness in our medical system, deluding doctors and
patients alike into believing that the inevitable can be delayed almost
indefinitely. <p>

<b>T</b>he reality of death and the perceptions of the participants -- the
dying person, the doctor, the family members -- are separated by a wide
gap.  We need to bring the two into closer alignment.  Doctors who are on
a first-name basis with disease must re-acquaint themselves with the
patient.  They must recognize that, by focusing exclusively on conquering
disease and prolonging life, they abandon the dying when, in their own
words, there is nothing more to be done.  They must come to terms with
their own death in order to provide proper care for the dying. <p>

<b>E</b>ighty percent of people die in hospitals, yet, for most people,
hospitals are not a good place to die.  Hospitals are set up to take care
of acute illnesses, and dying is not an illness.  It doesn't belong to an
official medical category, it has no DRG that would permit reimbursement
for the hospital and the physician.  If you go to a hospital to die , the
doctors have to find something wrong with you, something to treat, like
pneumonia or dehydration, or they cannot admit you.  They hook you up to
tubes and machines and try to fix a condition that isn't fixable.  The need
to arrive at a reimbursable diagnosis changes the reality.  The doctors
and nurses are working to prolong life, instead of preparing a patient for
death.  The ideal of a peaceful death is impossible in such an alien
setting, under such extreme conditions. <p>

<b>A</b> peaceful death is more likely to be achieved at home in familiar
surroundings that are more conducive to the comfort and ritual of leave
taking from family and friends.  Both my parents died at home.  In my
mothers case, after I accompanied her to the gates of heaven and left her
in good hands, she lost consciousness and lingered for another seven to
ten days before dying.  I visited her regularly to see if there was any
sign of communication or consciousness, but there wasn't.  She died at
home, because we could afford to keep her there with round-the-clock
nurses attending to her.  We weren't forced by lack of financial resources
to put her into a hospital where medical intervention may well have kept
her much longer in a state of limbo between living and dying.  Just by
giving her food, the process could have been unnecessarily prolonged. <p>

<b>O</b>nly twenty percent of people die in their own home, in a nursing
home, or in a hospice.  Hospices offer the kind of palliative care that
should be routine procedure in every institution that cares for the dying. 
Proper care includes the control of pain and other symptoms as well as
attention to the psychological and spiritual needs of the patient.  To
provide this care, hospices employ teams of doctors, nurses, social
workers, and bereavement counselors.  But the hospice alternative,
unfortunately, is not available to the majority of dying patients. 
Medicare coverage is limited.  As a result, most hospice programs deliver
care to the dying in their own home, restricting custodial services to
only four hours a day.  This requires the presence of a family member who
doesn't work, who is physically able, and who is willing to assume the
responsibilities for care the rest of the time. <p>

<b>T</b>he recommendations that follow from these observations are
obvious.  First and foremost, doctors, nurses, and other health
professionals need better training in the care of the dying, especially in
the relief of pain.  Health professionals also need training in
alleviating the psychological, emotional, and existential suffering that
may accompany dying.  Physical pain is what people fear most about dying. 
A dying person in pain cannot think about anything else, leaving no room
for coming to terms with death, for reviewing one's life, putting one's
affairs in order, for saying good-bye.  Therefore, pain relief must come
first.  Doctors often under medicate their dying patients for fear of turn
in them into drug addicts. <p>

<b>S</b>econd, hospitals must be required to develop and adopt a
comprehensive DRG for terminal care.  This single change would go a long
ways toward removing the hypocrisy that now surrounds a hospitals
treatment of the dying and freeing doctors and nurses to provide the kind
of care that doesn't rely on technology -- such as the simple act of paying
attention to a dying person, holding their hand, listening, and comforting
them. <p>

<b>T</b>hird, we must increase the availability of hospice services for
terminally ill patients removing restrictions on admittance and enhancing
reimbursement regulations.  We should consider laws that permit next of
kin to decide to forego life sustaining medical interventions even when a
patients wishes are not known.  The government may have to help family
members financially so that they can take care of dying persons at home by
the least expensive means.  These are only a few of the approaches to
transforming the culture of dying that our project will be exploring in
the months to come. <p>

<b>H</b>ow much will all this cost?  Can we afford to care for the dying
properly?  The number of people dying in the United States currently
stands at 2.2 million annually.  Increases in cancer and AIDS deaths and
the aging of the baby boomers will cause this figure to climb faster than
the population.  Today 1 in 8 Americans is 65 years or older.  In 30 to 40
years, 1 in 5 will be in that age group.  The average life expectancy for
those reaching age 65 is already 81 for men and 85 for women.  The fear is
that the dying of the elderly will drain the national treasury.  Like most
fears, this one is based on a myth, the popular perception that elderly,
terminally ill patients consume enormous amounts of resources shortly
before they die. <p>

<b>I</b>t is true that nearly half of all medical expenses are incurred in
the last six months of peoples lives.  But it is also true that medical
expenditures in the last year of life are lower for people 80 years and
older than for those in younger age groups. <p>

<b>A</b>ggressive, life-prolonging interventions, which may at times go
against the patient's wishes, are much more expensive than proper care for
the dying. <p>

<b>T</b>his brings me to that hotly debated subject, physician-assisted
suicide and euthanasia.  This is the one aspect of dying that is talked
about everywhere -- on television, in public forums, in newspaper
headlines, and serious journal articles.  Voters in Oregon just approved a
law that makes it the first state to lift the prohibition against
physician-assisted suicide. <p>

<b>A</b>s the son of a mother who was member of the Hemlock Society, and
as a reader of Plato's Phaedra, I cannot but approve.  But I must emphasize
that I am speaking in my personal capacity and not on behalf of the Board
of the Project on Death in America.  There are members of the Board who
take a different position and the Board as a whole wants to steer clear of
the issue because it feels it has plenty to do before opening that
Pandoras box.  Instead of getting embroiled in the debate on
physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia, they want to support the
training of health care professionals, enabling them to provide humane,
compassionate care to the dying, including improved physician-patient
communication, patient-centered care, better physician judgment on
withdrawing or withholding care, and familiarity with the principles and
practices of palliative care. <p>

<b>A</b>s founder of the project, I respect their judgment.  I believe in
personal autonomy; I believe people should be allowed to determine their
own end.  But I also recognize that legalizing euthanasia could have
unintended consequences, leading to all kind of abuses.  The issues need
to be carefully weighed, but I accept that this is not the first priority
of the Project.  Very few terminally ill patients would avail themselves
of the opportunity even if euthanasia were legalized.  After all, my
mother refused my help and I am glad she did.  The Project on Death in
America concerns itself with the vast majority of people who are not
looking for physician-assisted suicide and they have their work cut out
for them. <p>

<b>I</b>n conclusion, let me tell you how I came to terms with my own
death -- a subject I gave a lot of thought to in my youth.  I spent years
thinking about it.  Building on my insight that there is always a
divergence between ideas and facts I came to the conclusion that it is the
idea of my death which I cannot accept because it is a total denial of my
consciousness.  The fact of dying, when it comes, may be much more
acceptable, especially if it comes at the end of a long life.  The insight
that the idea is not the same as the fact, made the idea more bearable. <p>

<b>I</b> am sure that I would not find the argument persuasive if I had to 
confront the fact of my death here and now but as an idea I find it both 
convincing and comforting.  I wonder whether it has the same effect on 
you when you hear it for the first time.<p>

<b>A</b>s people come to terms with death, recognizing it as a fact of life, 
then the demand for physician-assisted suicide, as well as for 
unnecessary medical interventions, will drop.  That is one way I hope our 
efforts will influence the culture of dying.<p>

<b>Bangkok, 9  December</b><p>
Burma on Monday deported a Dutch  
woman who was said to have been working illegally as a journalist 
covering recent student protests.
  ``She came into the country posing as a tourist but she was  
actually covering the student incidents. She was found out and 
deported,'' a Burmese military government spokesman told Reuters 
by telephone from Rangoon. 
<p>
  Burma strictly on oversees journalists' visas.  
  Recently its embassies abroad have issued journalist visas  
selectively only just before the monthly news conferences 
organised by the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council. 
<p>
  The deported woman, Williamke Joanna Nyhuis, said on  
arrival in Bangkok that she had denied the Burmese charges when 
questioned in Rangoon.  She said she was interrogated on Sunday by Burmese immigration  
officials about connections with protesting students and 
opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. 
  ``They refused to say why I was being deported but  
questioned me about whether I had connections with the students, 
Suu Kyi and other foreigners,'' she said, adding that she travelled often to Burma. 
<p>
  Nyhuis, 38, would not disclose her profession.  
  Over the past week, the government has faced its biggest challenge from  
protesting students since troops put down student-led 
pro-democracy uprisings in 1988, killing and incarcerating thousands.

<P> 
<A NAME="DDE_LINK5">From </A><A HREF="interest.html">The Case for Legalization</A> 
<HR> 
 
<P> 
The drug/crime connection is one that continues to resist coherent 
analysis, both because cause and effect are so difficult to distinguish 
and because the role of the drug-prohibition laws in causing and 
labeling &quot;drug-related crime&quot; is so often ignored. There 
are four possible connections between drugs and crime, at least 
three of which would be much diminished if the drug-prohibition 
laws were repealed. First, producing, selling, buying, and consuming 
strictly controlled and banned substances is itself a crime that 
occurs billions of times each year in the United States alone. 
In the absence of drug-prohibition laws, these activities would 
obviously cease to be crimes. Selling drugs to children would, 
of course, continue to be criminal, and other evasions of government 
regulation of a legal market would continue to be prosecuted; 
but by and large the drug/crime connection that now accounts for 
all of the criminal-justice costs noted above would be severed. 
<P> 
Second, many illicit-drug users commit crimes such as robbery 
and burglary, as well as drug dealing, prostitution, and numbers 
running, to earn enough money to purchase the relatively high-priced 
illicit drugs. Unlike the millions of alcoholics who can support 
their habits for relatively modest amounts, many cocaine and heroin 
addicts spend hundreds and even thousands of dollars a week. If 
the drugs to which they are addicted were significantly cheaper-which 
would be the case if they were legalized-the number of crimes 
committed by drug addicts to pay for their habits would, in all 
likelihood, decline dramatically. Even if a legal-drug policy 
included the imposition of relatively high consumption taxes in 
order to discourage consumption, drug prices would probably still 
be lower than they are today. 
<P> 
The third drug/crime connection is the commission of crimes- violent 
crimes in particular-by people under the influence of illicit 
drugs. This connection seems to have the greatest impact upon 
the popular imagination. Clearly, some drugs do &quot;cause&quot; 
some people to commit crimes by reducing normal inhibitions, unleashing 
aggressive and other antisocial tendencies, and lessening the 
sense of responsibility. Cocaine, particularly in the form of 
crack, has gained such a reputation in recent years, just as heroin 
did in the 1960s and 1970s, and marijuana did in the years before 
that. Crack's reputation for inspiring violent behavior may or 
may not be more deserved than those of marijuana and heroin; reliable 
evidence is not yet available. No illicit drug, however, is as 
widely associated with<B> </B>violent behavior as alcohol. According 
to Justice Department statistics, 54 percent of all jail inmates 
convicted of violent crimes in 1983 reported having used alcohol 
just prior to committing their offense. The impact of drug legalization 
on this drug/crime connection is the most difficult to predict. 
Much would depend on overall rates of drug abuse and changes in 
the nature of consumption, both of which are impossible to predict. 
It is worth noting, however, that a shift in consumption from 
alcohol to marijuana would almost certainly contribute to a decline 
in violent behavior. 
<P> 
The fourth drug/crime link is the violent, intimidating, and corrupting 
behavior of the drug traffickers. Illegal markets tend to breed 
violence not only because they attract criminally-minded individuals, 
but also because participants in the market have no resort to 
legal institutions to resolve their disputes. During Prohibition, 
violent struggles between bootlegging gangs and hijackings of 
booze-laden trucks and sea vessels were frequent and notorious 
occurrences. Today's equivalents are the booby traps that surround 
some marijuana fields, the pirates of the Caribbean looking to 
rip off drug-laden vessels en route to the shores of the United 
States, and the machinegun battles and executions carried out 
by drug lords<B> </B>-- all of which occasionally kill innocent 
people. Most law-enforcement officials agree that the dramatic 
increases in urban murder<B> </B>rates during the past few years 
can be explained almost entirely by the rise in drug-dealer killings. 
<P> 
Perhaps the most unfortunate victims of the drug-prohibition policies 
have been the law-abiding residents of America s ghettos. These 
policies have largely proven futile in deterring large numbers 
of ghetto dwellers from becoming drug abusers, but they do account 
for much of what ghetto residents identify as the drug problem. 
In many neighborhoods, it often seems to be the aggressive gun-toting 
drug dealers who upset lawabiding residents far more than the 
addicts nodding out in doorways. Other residents, however, perceive 
the drug dealers as heroes and successful role models. In impoverished 
neighborhoods, they often stand out as symbols of success to children 
who see no other options. At the same time, the increasingly harsh 
criminal penalties imposed on adult drug dealers have led to the 
widespread recruitment of juveniles by drug traffickers. Formerly, 
children started dealing drugs only after they had been using 
them for a while; today the sequence is often reversed: many children 
start using illegal drugs now only after working for drug dealers. 
And the juvenile-justice system offers no realistic options for 
dealing with this growing problem. 
<P> 
The conspicuous failure of law-enforcement agencies to deal with 
this drug/crime connection is probably most responsible for the 
demoralization of neighborhoods and police departments alike. 
Intensive police crackdowns in urban neighborhoods do little more 
than chase the menace a short distance away to infect new areas. 
By contrast, legalization of the drug market would drive the drug-dealing 
business off the streets and out of the apartment buildings, and 
into legal, government-regulated, taxpaying stores. It would also 
force many of the gun-toting dealers out of business, and would 
convert others into legitimate businessmen. Some, of course, would 
turn to other types of criminal activities, just as some of the 
bootleggers did following Prohibition's repeal. Gone, however, 
would be the unparalleled financial temptations that lure so many 
people from all sectors of society into the drug-dealing business.

<p> 
Heroin looks like it is here to stay. Since the 1960s, millions of Americans have 
used heroin. Most stopped, with or without treatment, at some point. But there 
are an estimated half a million Americans addicted to heroin and a comparable 
number using it with some regularity. Heroin use grew rapidly during the 1960s, 
leveled off during the 1970s and 1980s, and now appears to be increasing again. 
Hospital emergency rooms saw an 80 percent increase in heroin-related 
episodes between 1990 and 1993.<a name="back1"></a><a 
href="#note1">1</a> The average purity of heroin purchased on the streets has 
increased from about 5 percent during the mid-1980s<a name="back2"></a><a 
href="#note2">2</a> to 40 percent today<a name="back3"></a><a 
href="#note3">3</a> -- and in New York City, Philadelphia, and Newark, New 
Jersey, it's over 60 percent.<a name="back4"></a><a href="#note4">4</a> 
 
<p>Heroin availability is up, and prices are down.<a name="back5"></a><a 
href="#note5">5</a> Street drug ethnographers report that heroin use is on the 
rise in cities and communities around the country, and that many new heroin 
users are working, white, and middle-class. Hopes for an international solution 
to the heroin problem have clearly been dashed: Opium is now cultivated 
throughout the world, with new countries joining the list of producing countries 
each year, and U.S. Customs Service officials admit that they are lucky to detect 
10 percent of the heroin entering the country. 
 
<p>Heroin is a powerful drug. Like other opiates, it provides very effective relief 
from pain and a strong sense of well being. Quitting heroin is a lot like quitting 
cigarettes. It's not that hard if you have not done it for too long or too regularly. 
It's generally easier for those who have a lot going for them and who thus have 
strong incentives to stop. Most heroin users, like most cigarette smokers, do try 
to quit. Most eventually succeed, although few do so on their first attempt. 
Many quit for months or years, only to start up once again. 
<p> 
 
<b>The best treatment</b> 
 
 
<p>There's no best way to quit heroin, cigarettes, or any other bad habit. But 
decades of scientific research have provided us with good information on what 
strategies work best for most people. 
 
<p>When it comes to quitting heroin, the evidence is in. In 1990, the National 
Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine found that "methadone maintenance 
has been the most rigorously studied [drug treatment] modality and has yielded 
the most incontrovertibly positive results."<a name="back6"></a><a 
href="#note6">6</a> Methadone, an opiate agonist, wards off withdrawal 
symptoms and suppresses drug craving among opiate addicts by stabilizing blood 
levels of the drug and its metabolites.<a name="back7"></a><a 
href="#note7">7</a> At proper doses, methadone lets addicts function normally, 
without making them "high," and can be safely consumed for decades with 
remarkably few bad side effects. In addiction treatment, methadone is typically 
consumed orally, once a day. Most methadone programs provide counseling, 
some medical care, and other ancillary services in addition to the drug. The 
objective of treatment, at least in principal, is to help addicts get their lives together 
and stop using illegal drugs, not to achieve total drug abstinence. 
 
<p>Methadone is to heroin users what nicotine skin patches are to tobacco 
smokers. Both deliver "addictive" drugs -- albeit drugs that pose virtually no health 
risks -- in a form designed to reduce associated harms to consumers and others. 
Both have proven effective in reducing more dangerous forms of drug 
consumption. Both are readily integrated with most living styles. Consumed orally 
or transdermally, neither provides addicts with much of the effect on mood or 
cognition experienced with injected heroin or smoked cigarettes. But both are 
potentially available in other forms -- injections, nasal sprays, and inhalers -- that 
may be more effective for some users. 
 
<p>In its review of the federal methadone regulations last year, the Institute of 
Medicine concluded: 
 
<blockquote>The effectiveness of methadone treatment of opiate addicts has 
been established in many studies conducted over three decades. Methadone- 
maintained patients show improvement in a number of outcomes...Consumption 
of all illicit drugs, especially heroin, declines. Crime is reduced, fewer individuals 
become HIV positive, and individual functioning is improved.<a 
name="back8"></a><a href="#note8">8</a></blockquote> 
 
Methadone, like heroin and other opiates, can cause physical dependence if 
taken on a regular basis. But "addiction" to methadone looks far more like a 
diabetic's "addiction" to insulin than a heroin addict's addiction to street heroin. 
Many methadone patients hold good jobs, and are responsible parents. They can 
safely drive motor vehicles and operate heavy machinery. They are, when 
prescribed adequate doses of methadone, practically indistinguishable from 
Americans who have never used heroin or methadone. 
 
<p>But the Institute of Medicine also reached another conclusion: 
 
<blockquote>Current policy...puts too much emphasis on protecting society from 
methadone, and not enough on protecting society from the epidemics of addiction, 
violence, and infectious diseases that methadone can help reduce.<a 
name="back9"></a><a href="#note9">9</a></blockquote> 
 
That report, and other studies before and since, indicate that the provision of 
methadone to heroin addicts trying to quit, and its use in drug treatment and 
medical settings, has been handicapped by federal and state regulations, 
ignorance of scientific research, prejudice against methadone users, and 
ideological assumptions that contradict common sense and good medical 
practice. 
 
<p>One hundred fifteen thousand Americans are now in methadone treatment.<a 
name="back10"></a><a href="#note10">10</a> If methadone were readily 
available, many tens and perhaps hundreds of thousands more would probably 
trade their illicit heroin habit for a legal methadone dependence. In Amsterdam, 
for example, where methadone is provided more liberally than in the United 
States, the ratio of methadone patients to heroin addicts is better than 6 to 10.<a 
name="back11"></a><a href="#note11">11</a> In the United States, the ratio is 
about 2 to 10.<a name="back12"></a><a href="#note12">12</a> Getting even 
a fraction of these unserved addicts into methadone treatment would mean 
significant reductions in heroin-related death, disease and crime, and substantial 
savings in government expenditures devoted to these problems. 
<p> 
 
<b>The early years</b> 
 
 
<p>There were great hopes in the mid-60s when Vincent Dole and Marie 
Nyswander of Rockefeller University discovered that methadone effectively 
reduced, or even eliminated, heroin craving among addicts when consumed daily 
on a long-term, maintenance basis. By the late-60s, heroin-related mortality was 
the leading cause of death for 15-35 year olds in New York City, serum hepatitis 
cases were up, and a record number of addicts were being arrested for drug- 
related crimes.<a name="back13"></a><a href="#note13">13</a> President 
Richard Nixon and others were looking for a quick fix. They saw methadone as a 
way of reducing demand for heroin and the problems -- especially crime among 
addicts -- that accompany it. Under the active leadership of federal officials and 
treatment providers, methadone programs expanded rapidly. In 1968, there were 
fewer than 400 patients in methadone treatment. By January 1973, there were 
73,000.<a name="back14"></a><a href="#note14">14</a> 
 
<p>But, as might be expected, methadone was oversold. The media called it a 
"Cinderella drug" and a "magic bullet." Programs expanded a bit too quickly, and 
the quality of treatment began to suffer. Dole and Nyswander's guidelines for 
proper methadone prescribing were not always followed. Both the public and 
many treatment providers wrongly believed that heroin addicts would only need to 
use methadone for a few months to quit their habits. Many providers gave doses 
that were too small, so their patients continued to use heroin and engage in related 
criminal behavior. A number of patients sold their methadone to heroin users on 
the illicit drug market. At some clinics, patients started hanging around outside, 
setting the stage for the NIMBY (not in my backyard) complaints that now block the 
establishment of new methadone clinics. Methadone acquired a reputation for 
being part of the drug problem, rather than part of the solution. 
 
<p>Notwithstanding these problems, much of methadone's promise held true. 
Work by researcher Herman Joseph shows that when New York's methadone 
census increased (by about 20,000) between 1971 and 1973, drug arrests 
dropped by almost 25,000 (from 40,000 in 1971 to 15,100 in 1973), and 
complaints to the police for robbery, burglary and grand larceny -- crimes usually 
associated with addiction -- dropped by 77,000 (from 350,000 to 273,000).<a name="back15"></a><a 
href="#note15">15</a> Drug dependency deaths also 
dropped dramatically, as did serum hepatitis cases among drug injectors.<a 
name="back16"></a><a href="#note16">16</a> Methadone was not singularly 
responsible for these dramatic results, but dozens of studies have since confirmed 
that enrollment in methadone programs is associated with dramatic reductions in 
crime, death, and disease -- including HIV/AIDS and hepatitis -- especially in 
properly run programs that prescribe adequate dosages, that do not detoxify 
patients prematurely, and that otherwise operate according to scientific standards. 
<p> 
 
<b>The most regulated drug</b> 
 
 
<p>Following rapidly on the heels of methadone's expansion came extensive 
regulations on its administration. Methadone is now the most highly regulated 
drug in the United States -- more tightly controlled than morphine, cocaine, 
amphetamine and many other prescription drugs that are far more toxic. Like 
other narcotic drugs, methadone is regulated at the federal level by the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). 
But, unlike any other drug, the actual circumstances under which methadone can 
be used to treat addiction are dictated and enforced by these federal agencies, 
along with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 
(SAMHSA).<a name="back17"></a><a href="#note17">17</a> Additional (and 
more restrictive) regulation is often imposed by states, counties, and 
municipalities. 
 
<p>Some of the regulations have proven useful in establishing minimum standards 
of service and guidelines for proper usage. But many are a hindrance to the 
effective employment of methadone. All methadone programs, regardless of 
location or clientele, are subject to similarly rigid staffing, security, 
documentation, and treatment requirements, all of which have little to do with 
quality treatment. Doctors can't prescribe methadone outside of designated 
treatment programs. Decisions usually left to doctors and their patients -- 
including dose level, admission criteria, time spent in treatment, and a host of 
other treatment specifics -- are dictated by federal, state, and local regulations. 
 
<p>Methadone maintenance patients -- many of whom stay in treatment for 20 
or 30 years -- are often subject to stricter supervision than convicted 
probationers and parolees.<a name="back18"></a><a href="#note18">18</a> 
Urine tests are required of all patients, regardless of time in treatment. Take- 
home medication is tightly controlled according to federal guidelines and is 
available in liquid form only.<a name="back19"></a><a href="#note19">19</a> 
All patients in standard methadone programs must come to the clinic at least 
weekly for their medication. In some states, even model patients -- who hold 
steady jobs and have been drug-free for years -- are required to show up at the 
clinic daily. Methadone patients can't fill their prescriptions at the pharmacy, 
even if they're traveling, and vacation time away from the clinic is tightly 
controlled. Some programs insist on withdrawing patients from methadone when 
they become pregnant, even though continuing methadone is the medically 
recommended course of treatment.<a name="back20"></a><a 
href="#note20">20</a> Most remarkably, eight states have no methadone 
programs whatsoever.<a name="back21"></a><a href="#note21">21</a> 
<p> 
 
<b>Poor treatment</b> 
 
<p> 
<p>At the same time, federal and other regulations have not been effective at 
holding methadone treatment programs to basic standards of good medical 
practice. The General Accounting Office's 1990 Report on methadone noted that 
it is considered by the federal government's primary drug research agencies to be 
the most effective treatment method for heroin addicts.<a name="back22"></a><a 
href="#note22">22</a> 
 
<p>But the GAO also warned that many programs are not effectively treating 
heroin addiction.<a name="back23"></a><a href="#note23">23</a> A 1992 
study of data from a national survey of methadone programs, conducted by 
Thomas D'Aunno and Thomas Vaughn of the University of Michigan's Institute for 
Social Research, found that one-half of the programs encouraged patients to 
detoxify after only six months in treatment,<a name="back24"></a><a 
href="#note24">24</a> notwithstanding abundant evidence that premature 
detoxification results in a return to heroin use in 80 percent to 90 percent of 
cases.<a name="back25"></a><a href="#note25">25</a> 
 
<p>Equally pervasive is a "less is more" approach to dosage levels. In the early 
methadone trials, Dole and Nyswander found 80 to 120 milligrams of methadone 
to be the average effective daily dose. Study after study over the past two 
decades has demonstrated that adequate dosing -- typically 60 to 100 milligrams 
per day and sometimes more -- results in better treatment outcomes, including 
improved retention of patients in treatment, reduced illicit drug use (of heroin and 
cocaine), and lowered incidence of HIV.<a name="back26"></a><a 
href="#note26">26</a> Yet the D'Aunno and Vaughn study found that a full 68 
percent of clinics kept patients at an average dose of 50 milligrams or less,<a 
name="back27"></a><a href="#note27">27</a> well below the minimum 
recommended dose.<a name="back28"></a><a href="#note28">28</a> Some of 
these dosage restrictions are required by state and local regulations, while others 
reflect either ignorance on the part of program doctors or willful disdain of the 
scientific evidence. 
 
<p> 
<b>Lessons from abroad</b> 
 
 
<p>There's no question that following through on the recommendations of the 
Institute of Medicine report, which called for easing the methadone regulations 
while leaving the basic clinic system in place, could significantly reduce drug use 
and heroin-related death, disease, and crime, even among the many addicts who 
use both heroin and cocaine.<a name="back29"></a><a href="#note29">29</a> 
The United States could gain much just by making its existing methadone clinics 
deliver treatment more effectively. But even more could be gained by going a step 
further and adopting the methadone policies that have spread in recent years 
throughout Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and even Hong Kong. 
 
<p>In these countries, national and especially local health authorities have 
recognized that methadone can be a highly effective tool for reducing the spread 
of HIV and serum hepatitis among drug users. Steps have been taken to attract 
and retain a higher proportion of illicit drug users in treatment by making 
methadone as easily available to heroin addicts as possible and by easing 
stringent restrictions on methadone dose levels. 
 
<p>But what most distinguishes methadone maintenance approaches abroad is 
the role of general practitioners and pharmacists in methadone provision and 
patient supervision. In the United States, general practitioners and pharmacists 
are virtually barred by federal regulations from playing any role in methadone 
maintenance; the only exceptions involve a few "medical maintenance" 
experiments that permit some long-term methadone recipients to transfer from 
traditional methadone clinics to hospital-based physicians. By contrast, 
thousands of general practitioners throughout Europe and Australia are now 
involved in methadone maintenance.<a name="back30"></a><a 
href="#note30">30</a> In Belgium and Germany this is the principal means of 
methadone distribution.<a name="back31"></a><a href="#note31">31</a> 
 
<p>Foreign innovators pioneered "low-threshold" programs, which make oral 
methadone readily available with fewer conditions, and often minimal ancillary 
services, to heroin addicts. These programs may not be as effective as the best 
full-service programs in keeping patients off heroin and away from criminal 
activity, but they are more successful in establishing contact with illicit drug users 
who are fearful of the rigorous requirements and the intrusiveness of more 
comprehensive programs. Not surprisingly, low-threshold programs are much 
less expensive and, thus, can accommodate many more heroin addicts than 
more full-service programs. (In the United States, only 7 percent of methadone 
treatment costs are spent on the drug itself.)<a name="back32"></a><a 
href="#note32">32</a> Studies show that low-threshold patients substantially 
reduce their drug use and typically fare better than do illicit drug users not 
enrolled in any programs.<a name="back33"></a><a href="#note33">33</a> 
Low-threshold programs now operate in several cities in Europe, Australia, and 
Asia. Low-threshold "methadone buses," which dispense methadone and related 
services at designated times and locations each day, can be found in a number 
of European cities.<a name="back34"></a><a href="#note34">34</a> These 
mobile programs make methadone more readily available to addicts and help 
avoid the NIMBY protests that so often accompany new methadone clinics. 
 
<p>Foreign developments in methadone maintenance haven't been entirely 
ignored in the United States, but they also haven't been implemented to great 
effect. Methadone buses are used in Baltimore, Maryland and Springfield, 
Massachusetts, but they operate much like traditional full-service programs. Low- 
threshold "interim clinics," which provide methadone without extensive ancillary 
services, have been approved by federal regulators as a short-term option for 
addicts on waiting lists for traditional methadone programs.<a 
name="back35"></a><a href="#note35">35</a> But Beth Israel Medical Center 
in New York City, the only provider of interim services, was forced to close its 
interim clinic in 1993, and there has yet to be another interim clinic opened 
anywhere in the United States. 
 
<p>Opposition to the clinic came primarily from defenders of established 
programs, who often object to relatively low-service methadone programs on the 
grounds that they are less effective than more "comprehensive" methadone 
programs in reducing illicit drug use and other undesirable drug-related behavior. 
Providers also worry that a successful "bare bones" program would mean 
funding cuts for their full-service programs. But given the explosion of the 
HIV/AIDS epidemic among heroin users and solid evidence that even 
methadone alone is effective, it's hard to excuse established methadone 
providers for blocking the expansion of a potentially lifesaving intervention. In 
New York City, where half of injecting drug users are HIV positive, only one new 
methadone clinic has opened since the mid-1970s, while several have closed. 
 
<p>What is needed is not just full-service programs, but a diversity of lower cost, 
low-threshold options that make methadone treatment a realistic option for the 
hundreds of thousands of heroin addicts who are not reached by the present 
treatment system. Physician prescribing and low-threshold treatment make 
methadone available to heroin addicts who live far from methadone clinics, 
allocate counseling and other services more efficiently, and are less intrusive, 
less stigmatizing, and more flexible than traditional clinics. They remove the "ball 
and chain" from methadone treatment and make it more attractive to middle 
class addicts who are most worried about their jobs, reputations, and family 
responsibilities. Perhaps most importantly, allowing more physicians to prescribe 
methadone would help involve the mainstream medical community in the 
treatment of drug addiction. 
<p> 
 
<b>A red herring</b> 
 
 
<p>Why hasn't the United States capitalized on these foreign innovations? A 
major obstacle is the Drug Enforcement Administration. Federal drug 
enforcement agencies have opposed drug maintenance programs for addicts 
since early in this century. Physicians who had prescribed morphine for 
maintenance were driven from practice during the early years of drug prohibition, 
in the late 1910s and early 1920s.<a name="back36"></a><a 
href="#note36">36</a> In the 1960s, drug enforcement agents tried to block 
early experiments with methadone,<a name="back37"></a><a 
href="#note37">37</a> and even now they provide only reluctant support for 
methadone maintenance, arguing that any loosening of restrictions on 
methadone prescribing would result in a bigger illicit market in diverted 
methadone and more methadone overdose deaths.<p> 
 
<p>Although some methadone patients clearly do sell their methadone, the 
magnitude of the problem has been greatly exaggerated. In a recent response to 
the Institute of Medicine report, Gene Haislip, director of the DEA's Office of 
Diversion Control, overstated the evidence, citing 344 deaths involving 
methadone in 1992<a name="back38"></a><a href="#note38">38</a> when only 
13 deaths that year could be traced to methadone alone.<a 
name="back39"></a><a href="#note39">39</a> Furthermore, the restrictive 
measures supported by the DEA have not even proven effective. A 1986 study of 
methadone diversion by Barry Spunt and his colleagues at Narcotics and Drug 
Research Inc. concluded that the two diversion-control measures at the disposal of 
treatment providers -- namely restrictions on take-home medicine and punitive 
dose reduction for patients who sell their methadone -- are harmful to patients and 
have minimal effect on methadone diversion.<a name="back40"></a><a 
href="#note40">40</a> 
 
<p>The illicit market in methadone is the predictable result of insufficient 
methadone availability. "A black market has been created," notes methadone's 
founder, Vincent Dole, "because there is an unmet demand and because political 
propaganda and community opposition have made it impossible to open more 
clinics."<a name="back41"></a><a href="#note41">41</a> But the illicit market 
in methadone may not be all bad. Methadone is simply not a drug of choice, and 
cases of diverted methadone going to first-time opiate users are exceedingly rare. 
Most buyers of diverted methadone are active heroin users who won't or can't get 
into a methadone program.<a name="back42"></a><a href="#note42">42</a> 
As the Institute of Medicine concluded, after its careful review of methadone 
regulations and diversion, "the risks to public safety and public health of diverted 
methadone do not outweigh the benefits of making methadone treatment more 
readily available."<a name="back43"></a><a href="#note43">43</a> Even 
former "drug czar" Lee Brown, director of the Office of National Drug Control 
Policy, gave his tentative support to the regulatory revisions recommended by 
the Institute of Medicine.<a name="back44"></a><a href="#note44">44</a> But 
the DEA continues to fight for even more onerous, inefficient, and expensive 
methadone regulations; thus far it has prevailed. 
<p> 
 
<b>Less regulation, better treatment</b> 
 
 
<p>The poor utilization of methadone in the United States represents a clear 
case of politics and prejudice trumping science and the interests of public health. 
With some 500,000 heroin addicts in the country, any method that is proven 
effective in reducing heroin use and heroin-related disease, death, and crime 
needs to be made as readily available as possible -- especially when it's safe 
and relatively inexpensive. Moreover, we need not just more "full service" 
methadone treatment programs but also easy access to methadone for addicts 
who don't require or want the counseling and other services. 
 
<p>Methadone, in short, needs to be deregulated, and put back into the hands 
of the medical community. Let the FDA regulate methadone just like any other 
prescription drug. Allow physicians to prescribe methadone to addicts as part of 
general practice, and encourage cooperation between primary health care 
providers and drug treatment specialists. Let methadone be picked up in 
pharmacies -- just like every other medication in this country. And leave the 
specifics of methadone treatment to be dictated by patient need and provider 
expertise, not by government micro-management. Ensuring that methadone is 
prescribed according to accepted medical and scientific standards is an 
appropriate role for clinical practice guidelines and formal quality assurance 
systems, which need not be governmental. 
 
<p>If you call addiction a disease, think of methadone as the equivalent of 
insulin. If you call addiction a bad habit, treat methadone like the nicotine patch. 
Either way, there's no good reason for making methadone a ball and chain. The 
only argument against all this -- that it might stimulate the illicit market in 
methadone -- is a red herring. The best way to eliminate the illicit market in this 
very effective medicine is to make methadone as readily available as possible to 
any heroin user who wants it. There's virtually no downside -- just clear benefits.

<font size=2><i>Grinspoon, Lester, and James B. Bakalar. "Marihuana<br> 
as Medicine: A Plea for Reconsideration." Editorial. <b>Journal<br> 
of the American Medical Association</b> 273.23 (1995): 1875-76.</i></font size=2><HR> <br> 
 
BETWEEN 1840 and 1900, European and American medical journals 
published more than 100 articles on the therapeutic use of the 
drug known then as Cannabis indica (or Indian hemp) and now as 
marihuana. It was recommended as an appetite stimulant, muscle 
relaxant, analgesic, hypnotic, and anti-convulsant. As late as 
1913 Sir William Osler recommended it as the most satisfactory 
remedy for migraine. 
<P> 
Today the 5000-year medical history of cannabis has been almost 
forgotten. Its use declined in the early 20th century because 
the potency of preparations was variable, responses to oral ingestion 
were erratic, and alternatives became available--injectable opiates 
and, later, synthetic drugs such as aspirin and barbiturates. 
In the United States, the final blow was struck by the Marihuana 
Tax Act of 1937. Designed to prevent non-medical use, this law 
made cannabis so difficult to obtain for medical purposes that 
it was removed from the pharmacopeia. It is now confined to Schedule 
I under the Controlled Substances Act as a drug that has a high 
potential for abuse, lacks an accepted medical use, and is unsafe 
for use under medical supervision. 
<P> 
In 1972 the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana 
Laws petitioned the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, later 
renamed the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), to transfer 
marihuana to Schedule II so that it could be legally prescribed. 
As the proceedings continued, other parties joined, including 
the Physicians Association for AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome] Care. It was only in 1986, after many years of legal 
maneuvering, that the DEA acceded to the demand for the public 
hearings required by law. During the hearings, which lasted 2 
years, many patients and physicians testified and thousands of 
pages of documentation were introduced. In 1988 the DEA's own 
administrative law judge, Francis L. Young, declared that marihuana 
in its natural form fulfilled the legal requirement of currently 
accepted medical use in treatment in the United States. He added 
that it was `one of the safest therapeutically active substances 
known to man.' <A NAME="mark1"></A><A HREF="#note1">(1)</A> His 
order that the marihuana plant be transferred to Schedule II was 
overruled, not by any medical authority, but by the DEA itself, 
which issued a final rejection of all pleas for reclassification 
in March 1992. 
<P> 
Meanwhile, a few patients have been able to obtain marihuana legally 
for therapeutic purposes. Since 1978, legislation permitting patients 
with certain disorders to use marihuana with a physician's approval 
has been enacted in 36 states. Although federal regulations and 
procedures made the laws difficult to implement, 10 states eventually 
established formal marihuana research programs to seek Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) approval for Investigational New Drug 
(IND) applications. These programs were later abandoned, mainly 
because the bureaucratic burden on physicians and patients became 
intolerable. 
<P> 
Growing demand also forced the FDA to institute an Individual 
Treatment IND (commonly referred to as a Compassionate IND) for 
the use of physicians whose patients needed marihuana because 
no other drug would produce the same therapeutic effect. The application 
process was made enormously complicated, and most physicians did 
not want to become involved, especially since many believed there 
was some stigma attached to prescribing cannabis. Between 1976 
and 1988 the government reluctantly awarded about a half dozen 
Compassionate INDs for the use of marihuana. In 1989 the FDA was 
deluged with new applications from people with AIDS, and the number 
granted rose to 34 within a year. In June 1991, the Public Health 
Service announced that the program would be suspended because 
it undercut the administration's opposition to the use of illegal 
drugs. After that no new Compassionate INDs were granted, and 
the program was discontinued in March 1992. Eight patients are 
still receiving marihuana under the original program; for everyone 
else it is officially a forbidden medicine. 
<P> 
And yet physicians and patients in increasing numbers continue 
to relearn through personal experience the lessons of the 19th 
century. Many people know that marihuana is now being used illegally 
for the nausea and vomiting induced by chemotherapy. Some know 
that it lowers intraocular pressure in glaucoma. Patients have 
found it useful as an anticonvulsant, as a muscle relaxant in 
spastic disorders, and as an appetite stimulant in the wasting 
syndrome of human immunodeficiency virus infection. It is also 
being used to relieve phantom limb pain, menstrual cramps, and 
other types of chronic pain, including (as Osler might have predicted) 
migraine. <A NAME="mark2"></A><A HREF="#note2">(2)</A> Polls and 
voter referenda have repeatedly indicated that the vast majority 
of Americans think marihuana should be medically available. 
<P> 
One of marihuana's greatest advantages as a medicine is its remarkable 
safety. It has little effect on major physiological functions. 
There is no known case of a lethal overdose; on the basis of animal 
models, the ratio of lethal to effective dose is estimated as 
40,000 to 1. By comparison, the ratio is between 3 and 50 to 1 
for secobarbital and between 4 and 10 to 1 for ethanol. Marihuana 
is also far less addictive and far less subject to abuse than 
many drugs now used as muscle relaxants, hypnotics, and analgesics. 
The chief legitimate concern is the effect of smoking on the lungs. 
Cannabis smoke carries even more tars and other particulate matter 
than tobacco smoke. But the amount smoked is much less, especially 
in medical use, and once marihuana is an openly recognized medicine, 
solutions may be found. Water pipes are a partial answer; ultimately 
a technology for the inhalation of cannabinoid vapors could be 
developed. Even if smoking continued, legal availability would 
make it easier to take precautions against aspergilli and other 
pathogens. At present, the greatest danger in medical use of marihuana 
is its illegality, which imposes much anxiety and expense on suffering 
people, forces them to bargain with illicit drug dealers, and 
exposes them to the threat of criminal prosecution. 
<P> 
The main active substance in cannabis, D(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol 
(&lt;unprintable&gt;/9/-THC), has been available for limited purposes 
as a Schedule II synthetic drug since 1985. This medicine, dronabinol 
(Marinol), taken orally in capsule form, is sometimes said to 
obviate the need for medical marihuana. Patients and physicians 
who have tried both disagree. The dosage and duration of action 
of marihuana are easier to control, and other cannabinoids in 
the marihuana plant may modify the action of &lt;unprintable&gt;/9/-THC. 
The development of cannabinoids in pure form should certainly 
be encouraged, but the time and resources required are great and 
at present unavailable. In these circumstances, further isolation, 
testing, and development of individual cannabinoids should not 
be considered a substitute for meeting the immediate needs of 
suffering people. 
<P> 
Although it is often objected that the medical usefulness of marihuana 
has not been demonstrated by controlled studies, several informal 
experiments involving large numbers of subjects suggest an advantage 
for marihuana over oral &lt;unprintable&gt;/9/-THC and other medicines. 
For example, from 1978 through 1986 the state research program 
in New Mexico provided marihuana or synthetic &lt;unprintable&gt;/9/-THC 
to about 250 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy after conventional 
medications failed to control their nausea and vomiting. A physician 
who worked with the program testified at a DEA hearing that for 
these patients marihuana was clearly superior to both chlorpromazine 
and synthetic &lt;unprintable&gt;/9/-THC. <A NAME="mark3"></A><A HREF="#note3">(3)</A> 
It is true that we do not have studies controlled according to 
the standards required by the FDA--chiefly because legal, bureaucratic, 
and financial obstacles are constantly put in the way. The situation 
is ironical, since so much research has been done on marihuana, 
often in unsuccessful attempts to prove its dangerous and addictive 
character, that we know more about it than about most prescription 
drugs. 
<P> 
Physicians should offer more encouragement to controlled research, 
but it too has limitations. Individual therapeutic responses can 
be obscured by the statistical results of group experiments in 
which there is little effort to identify the specific features 
of a patient that affect the drug response. Furthermore, much 
of our knowledge of synthetic medicines as well as plant derivatives 
comes from anecdotal evidence. For example, as early as 1976 several 
small, methodologically imperfect, and relatively obscure studies 
had shown that taking an aspirin a day could prevent a second 
heart attack. In 1988 a large-scale experiment demonstrated dramatic 
effects. This story is suggestive, because marihuana, like aspirin, 
is a substance known to be unusually safe and to have enormous 
potential health benefits. 
<P> 
Cannabis can also bring about immediate relief of suffering measurable 
in a study with only one subject. In the experimental method known 
as the single-patient randomized trial, active and placebo treatments 
are administered randomly in alternation or succession to a patient. 
The method is often useful when large-scale controlled studies 
are impossible or inappropriate because the disorder is rare, 
the patient is atypical, or the response to the treatment is idiosyncratic. 
Many patients, either deliberately or because of unreliable supplies, 
have informally carried out somewhat similar experiments by alternating 
periods of cannabis use with periods of no use in the treatment 
of various disorders. <A NAME="mark2a"></A><A HREF="#note2a">(2) (pp133-136)</A> 
<P> 
The American Medical Association was one of the few organizations 
that raised a voice in opposition to the Marihuana Tax Act of 
1937, yet today most physicians seem to take little active interest 
in the subject, and their silence is often cited by those who 
are determined that marihuana shall remain a forbidden medicine. 
Meanwhile, many physicians pretend to ignore the fact that their 
patients with cancer, AIDS, or multiple sclerosis are smoking 
marihuana for relief; some quietly encourage them. In a 1990 survey, 
44% of oncologists said they had suggested that a patient smoke 
marihuana for relief of the nausea induced by chemotherapy. <A NAME="mark4"></A><A 
HREF="#note4">(4)</A> 
If marihuana were actually unsafe for use even under medical supervision, 
as its Schedule I status explicitly affirms, this recommendation 
would be unthinkable. It is time for physicians to acknowledge 
more openly that the present classification is scientifically, 
legally, and morally wrong. 
<P> 
Physicians have both a right and a duty to be skeptical about 
therapeutic claims for any substance, but only after putting aside 
fears and doubts connected with the stigma of illicit non-medical 
drug use. Advocates of medical use of marihuana are sometimes 
charged with using medicine as a wedge to open a way for `recreational' 
use. The accusation is false as applied to its target, but expresses 
in a distorted form a truth about some opponents of medical marihuana: 
they will not admit that it can be a safe and effective medicine 
largely because they are stubbornly committed to exaggerating 
its dangers when used for non-medical purposes. 
<P> 
We are not asking readers for immediate agreement with our affirmation 
that marihuana is medically useful, but we hope they will do more 
to encourage open and legal exploration of its potential. The 
ostensible indifference of physicians should no longer be used 
as a justification for keeping this medicine in the shadows.

<A NAME="intro"></A>WHAT CAN BE DONE about the &quot;drug problem&quot;? 
Despite frequent proclamations of war and dramatic increases in 
government funding and resources in recent years, there are many 
indications that the problem is not going away and may even be 
growing worse. During the past year alone, more than thirty million 
Americans violated the drug laws on literally billions of occasions. 
Drug-treatment programs in many cities are turning people away 
for lack of space and funding. In Washington, D.C., drug-related 
killings, largely of one drug dealer by another, are held responsible 
for a doubling in the homicide rate over the past year. In New 
York and elsewhere, courts and prisons are clogged with a virtually 
limitless supply of drug-law violators. In large cities and small 
towns alike, corruption of policemen and other criminal-justice 
officials by drug traffickers is rampant. 
<P> 
President Reagan and the First Lady are not alone in supporting 
increasingly repressive and expensive anti-drug measures, and 
in believing that the war against drugs can be won. Indeed, no 
&quot;war&quot; proclaimed by an American leader during the past 
forty years has garnered such sweeping bipartisan support; on 
this issue, liberals and conservatives are often indistinguishable. 
The fiercest disputes are not over objectives or even broad strategies, 
but over turf and tactics. Democratic politicians push for the 
appointment of a &quot;drug czar&quot; to oversee all drug policy, 
and blame the Administration for applying sufficient pressure 
and sanctions against the foreign drug-producing countries. Republicans 
try to gain the upper hand by daring Democrats to support more 
widespread drug testing, increasingly powerful law-enforcement 
measures, and the death penalty for various drug-related offenses. 
But on the more fundamental issues of what this war is about, 
and what strategies are most likely to be successful in the long 
run, no real debate-much less vocal dissent-can be heard. 
<P> 
If there were a serious public debate on this issue, far more 
attention would be given to one policy option that has just begun 
to be seriously considered, but which may well prove more successful 
than anything currently being implemented or proposed: Legalization. 
Politicians and public officials remain hesitant even to mention 
the word, except to dismiss it contemptuously as a capitulation 
to the drug traffickers. Most Americans perceive drug legalization 
as an invitation to drug-infested anarchy. Even the civil-liberties 
groups shy away from this issue, limiting their input primarily 
to the drug-testing debate. The minority communities in the ghetto, 
for whom repealing the drug laws would promise the greatest benefits, 
fail to recognize the costs of our drug-prohibition policies. 
And the typical middle-class American, who hopes only that his 
children will not succumb to drug abuse, tends to favor any measures 
that he believes will make illegal drugs less accessible to them. 
Yet when one seriously compares the advantages and disadvantages 
of the legalization strategy with those of current and planned 
policies, abundant evidence suggests that legalization may well 
be the optimal strategy for tackling the drug problem. 
<P> 
Interestingly, public support for repealing the drug-prohibition 
has traditionally come primarily from the conservative end of 
the political spectrum: Milton Friedman, Ernest van den Haag, 
William F. Buckley, and the editors of the <EM>Economist</EM><I> 
</I>have all supported it. Less vocal support comes from many 
liberals, politicians among them, who are disturbed by the infringements 
on individual liberty posed by the drug laws. There is also a 
significant constituency in favor of repeal, found especially 
among criminal justice officials, intelligence analysts, military 
interdictors, and criminal-justice scholars who have spent a considerable 
amount of time thinking about the problem. More often than not, 
however, job-security considerations, combined with an awareness 
that they can do little to change official policies, ensure that 
their views remain discreet and off the record. 
<P> 
During the spring of 1988, however, legalization suddenly began 
to be seriously considered as a policy option; the pros and cons 
of legalization were discussed on the front pages of leading newspapers 
and news magazines, and were debated on national television programs. 
Although the argument for legalization was not new, two factors 
seem to have been primarily responsible for the blitz of media 
coverage: an intellectual rationale for legalization-the first 
provided in decades-appeared in my article in the Spring issue 
of <EM>Foreign Policy</EM> magazine; more importantly, political 
legitimacy was subsequently bestowed upon the legalization option 
when Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke, speaking to the National Conference 
of Mayors, noted the potential benefits of drug legalization and 
asked that the merits of legalization be debated in congressional 
hearings. 
<P> 
The idea of legalizing drugs was quickly denounced by most politicians 
across the political spectrum; nevertheless, the case for legalization 
appealed to many Americans. The prominent media coverage lent 
an aura of respectability to arguments that just a month earlier 
had seemed to be beyond the political pale. Despite the tendency 
of many journalists to caricature the legalization argument, at 
long last the issue had been joined. Various politicians, law-enforcement 
officials, health experts, and scholars came out in favor of drug 
legalization-or at least wanted to debate the matter seriously. 
On Capitol Hill, three or four congressmen seconded the call for 
a debate. According to some congressional staffers, two dozen 
additional legislators would have wanted to debate the issue, 
had the question arisen after rather than before the upcoming 
elections. Unable to oppose a mere hearing on the issue, Congressman 
Charles Rangel, chairman of the House Select Committee on Narcotics, 
declared his willingness to convene his committee in Baltimore 
to consider the legalization option. 
<P> 
There is, of course, no single legalization strategy. At one extreme 
is the libertarian vision of virtually no government restraints 
on the production and sale of drugs or any psychoactive substances, 
except perhaps around the fringes, such as prohibiting sales to 
children. At the other extreme is total government control over 
the production and sale of these goods. In between lies a strategy 
that may prove more successful than anything yet tried in stemming 
the problems of drug abuse and drug-related violence, corruption, 
sickness, and suffering. It is one in which government makes most 
of the substances that are now banned legally available to competent 
adults, exercises strong regulatory powers over all large-scale 
production and sale of drugs, makes drug-treatment programs available 
to all who need them, and offers honest drug-education programs 
to children. This strategy, it is worth noting, would also result 
in a net benefit to public treasuries of at least ten billion 
dollars a year, and perhaps much more. 
<P> 
There are three reasons why it is important to think about legalization 
scenarios, even though most Americans remain hostile to the idea. 
First, current drug-control policies have failed, are failing, 
and will continue to fail, in good part because they are fundamentally 
flawed. Second, many drug-control efforts are not only failing, 
also proving highly costly and counter-productive; indeed, many 
of the drug-related evils that Americans identify as part and 
parcel of the &quot;drug problem&quot; are in fact caused by our 
drug prohibition policies. Third, there is good reason to believe 
that repealing many of the drug laws would not lead, as many people 
, to a dramatic rise in drug abuse. In this essay I expand on 
each these reasons for considering the legalization option. Government 
efforts to deal with the drug problem will succeed only if the 
rhetoric and crusading mentality that now dominate drug policy 
are replaced by reasoned and logical analysis.

<center><h2>Methadone Maintenance Treatment</h2></center><p> 
 
<hr> 
 
<p> 
 
Methadone, a long-acting synthetic narcotic analgesic, was first used in the 
maintenance treatment of drug addiction in the mid-1960s, by Drs. Vincent Dole 
and Marie Nyswander of Rockefeller University. There are now 115,000 
methadone maintenance patients in the U.S. 40,000 of them are in New York 
State, and about half that many are in California.(1) Methadone is widely 
employed throughout the world, and is the most effective known treatment for 
heroin addiction.(2) 
<p> 
The goal of methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is to reduce illegal heroin 
use and the crime, death, disease, and other negative consequences associated 
with addiction. Methadone can be used to detoxify heroin addicts, but most 
heroin addicts who detox -- using methadone or any other method -- return to 
heroin use. Therefore, the goal of methadone maintenance treatment is to 
reduce and even eliminate heroin use among addicts by stabilizing them on 
methadone for as long as is necessary to help them keep their lives together and 
avoid returning to previous patterns of drug use. The benefits of methadone 
maintenance treatment have been established by hundreds of scientific studies, 
and there are almost no negative health consequences of long-term methadone 
treatment, even when it continues for twenty or thirty years. 
<p> 
<b><i>The success of methadone in reducing crime, death, disease, and drug use 
is well documented.</i></b>(3) 
<ul> 
<li><b>Methadone is the most effective treatment for heroin addiction.</b><br> 
Compared to the other major drug treatment modalities -- drug-free outpatient 
treatment, therapeutic communities, and chemical dependency treatment -- 
methadone is the most rigorously studied and has yielded the best results.(4) 
<li><b>Methadone is effective HIV/AIDS prevention.</b>(5)<br> 
MMT reduces the frequency of injecting and of needle sharing.(6) Methadone 
treatment is also an important point of contact with service providers, and supplies 
an opportunity to teach drug users harm reduction techniques such as how to 
prevent HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, and other health problems -- including abscesses, 
dermatitis, and overdoses -- that endanger drug users.(7) 
<li><b>Methadone treatment reduces criminal behavior.</b>(8)<br> 
Drug offense arrests decline because MMT patients reduce or stop buying and 
using illegal drugs. Arrests for predatory crimes decline because MMT patients 
no longer need to finance a costly heroin addiction, and because treatment 
allows many patients to stabilize their lives and return to legitimate employment. 
<li><b>Methadone drastically reduces, and often eliminates, heroin use among 
addicts.</b>(9)<br> 
The Treatment Outcome Prospective Study (TOPS) - the largest contemporary 
controlled study of drug treatment - found that patients drastically reduced their 
heroin use while in treatment, with less than 10% using heroin weekly or daily after 
just three months in treatment.(10) After 2 years or more, heroin use among MMT 
patients declines, on average, to 15% of pre-treatment levels.(11) Often, use of 
other drugs -- including cocaine,(12) sedatives,(13) and even alcohol(14) -- also 
declines when an opiate addict enters methadone treatment, even though 
methadone has no direct pharmacological effect on non-opiate drug craving. 
 
<li><b>Methadone is cost effective.</b><br> 
MMT, which costs on average about $4,000 per patient per year,(15) reduces 
the criminal behavior associated with illegal drug use, promotes health, and 
improves social productivity, all of which serve to reduce the societal costs of 
drug addiction.(16) Incarceration, by comparison, costs $20,000(17) to 
$40,000(18) per year. Residential drug treatment programs cost $13- 
20,000/year.(19) Furthermore, given that only 5-10 percent of the cost of MMT 
actually pays for the medication itself,(20) methadone could be prescribed and 
delivered even less expensively, through physicians in general medical practice, 
low-service clinics, and pharmacies. 
</ul> 
<p> 
<b><i>Methadone is Effective Outside of Traditional Clinic Settings:</i></b> 
Methadone in the U.S. is generally restricted to specialized methadone clinics, 
which are subject to a host of counseling and other service requirements 
mandated by federal, state, and municipal regulators. Though limited, 
experiments with providing methadone through alternate means have had 
positive results. 
<p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Limited Service Methadone Maintenance</b><br> 
Limited service MMT is a low-cost method of providing methadone treatment 
services to addicts who cannot or will not access comprehensive methadone 
programs. Though limited service programs may not be as effective as the best 
full service programs, their patients do substantially reduce drug use and 
typically fare better than do illicit drug users not enrolled in any programs.(21) 
<li><b>Physician Prescribing</b><br> 
MMT as part of general medical practice is common throughout Europe, 
Australia, and New Zealand, but is severely restricted in the U.S. There have 
been U.S. "medical maintenance" trials, which permitted some long-term 
methadone recipients to transfer from traditional methadone clinics to hospital- 
based physicians. Medical maintenance, where tested, has achieved excellent 
treatment results.(22) Medical maintenance is also cost effective, and patients 
prefer it over traditional methadone clinics.(23) 
</ul> 
<p> 
<center><h4><i>Questions About Methadone</i></h4></center> 
<p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>How does methadone work?</b><br> 
Methadone is an opiate agonist which has a series of actions similar to those of 
morphine and other narcotic medications.(24) Heroin addicts are physically 
dependent on opiate drugs, and will experience withdrawal symptoms if the 
concentration of opiates in the body falls below a certain level. In maintenance 
treatment, patients are given enough methadone to ward off opiate withdrawal 
symptoms, but not enough to induce narcotic effects.(25) 
<li><b>Does methadone make patients "high" or interfere with normal 
functioning?</b><br> 
No. Used in maintenance treatment, in proper doses, methadone does not 
create euphoria, sedation, or analgesia.(26) Methadone has no adverse effects 
on motor skills, mental capability, or employability.(27) 
<li><b>What is the proper dose of methadone?</b><br> 
Dose must be individually determined, because of differences in metabolism, 
body weight, and opiate tolerance.(28) The proper maintenance dose is one at 
which narcotic craving is averted -- without creating euphoria, sedation, or 
analgesia -- for 24-36 hours.(29) Doses of 60-100 mg, and sometimes more, are 
required for most patients,(30) and doses below 60 mg are almost always 
insufficient for patients who wish to abstain from heroin use.(31) 
<li><b>Is methadone more addictive than heroin?</b><br> 
Physical dependence and tolerance to a drug are part of addiction, but they're 
not the whole story. Addiction is characterized by compulsive use of the drug 
despite adverse consequences.(32) The MMT patient is no more an addict than 
the terminal cancer patient who is physically dependent on morphine, or the 
diabetic who is dependent on insulin. They do not seek out the drug in the 
absence of withdrawal symptoms or pain, and their lives do not revolve around 
drug use. 
<li><b>Is methadone harder to kick than heroin?</b><br> 
Symptoms of abrupt withdrawal are qualitatively similar when the amount of drug 
used is pharmacologically equivalent, but withdrawal from heroin tends to be 
intense and fairly brief, while methadone withdrawal is less acute and longer 
lasting.(33) Withdrawal symptoms can be ameliorated by tapering the dose over 
an extended period of time.(34) 
<li><b>Is methadone maintenance treatment for life?</b><br> 
Some patients remain in methadone treatment for more than ten years, and 
even for the rest of their lives, but they constitute a minority (5-20%) of 
patients.(35) 
<li><b>How long should treatment last?</b><br> 
Generally, the length of time spent in treatment is positively related to treatment 
success.(36) The duration of treatment should be individually and clinically 
determined, and treatment should last for as long as the physician and the 
individual patient agree is appropriate.(37) Federal, and often state, regulations 
require annual evaluation of patients to determine whether they should continue 
in MMT.(38) 
<li><b>Is methadone a desirable street drug, with high potential for 
abuse?</b><br> 
Though methadone is sometimes sold on the illicit drug market, most buyers of 
diverted methadone are active heroin users who won't or can't get into a 
methadone program.(39) The extent of abuse associated with diverted 
methadone is small relative to heroin and cocaine, and primary addiction to 
methadone is rare.(40) While methadone, like almost any drug, can cause 
overdoses if used improperly, overdose deaths attributed to methadone alone are 
few, and are incidental compared to heroin deaths. The Drug Abuse Warning 
Network found, in its 1994 sample of emergency room incidents, 15 methadone 
deaths, 251 heroin/morphine deaths, and 13 aspirin deaths.(41) Finally, not all 
methadone overdose deaths are necessarily caused by illicitly purchased 
methadone; some are undoubtedly the result of accidental or inappropriate 
consumption of legally obtained methadone. 
<li><b>Does methadone interfere with good health?</b><br> 
Scientific studies have shown that the most significant health consequence of long 
term methadone treatment is a marked improvement in general health.(42) 
Concerns about methadone's effects on the immune system(43) and on the 
kidneys, liver, and heart(44) have been laid to rest. Methadone's most common 
side effects -- constipation and sweating -- usually fade with time, and are not 
serious health hazards.(45) 
<li><b>Is it safe to take methadone during pregnancy?</b><br> 
MMT during pregnancy does not impair the child's developmental and cognitive 
functioning, and it is the medically recommended course of treatment for most 
pregnant opiate-dependent women.(46) 
<li><b>Is methadone maintenance appropriate for all drug users?</b><br> 
No. Methadone is a treatment for opiate dependence, and is not appropriate for 
individuals who use heroin but are not, and have not been, dependent.(47) 
There are also drug-free treatment options and, increasingly, other medications - 
- including buprenorphine and LAAM -- that may be appropriate for some 
users.(48)

<p> 
During the late '80s, Americans shook their heads in disgust at reports that poor black mothers 
were sacrificing the little ones resting in their wombs for the pleasures of crack cocaine, callously 
dooming a new generation to "a life of certain suffering, of probable deviance, of permanent 
inferiority," to quote columnist Charles Krauthammer. 
<p> 
Seizing on early studies that raised alarm over fetal damage from cocaine, scientists cited the same 
inconclusive data again and again. Local news organs spun their own versions of the crack-baby 
story, taking for granted the accuracy of its premise. Social workers, foster parents, doctors, 
teachers, and journalists put forward unsettling anecdotes about the "crack babies" they had seen, 
all participating in a sleight of hand so elegant in its simplicity that they fooled even themselves. 
They talked of babies shrieking like cats and refusing to bond, of children unable to focus on a 
task -- and then they slipped in the part they should have tested, attributing these problems to 
prenatal cocaine use. Reporters went into hospital nurseries and special schools and borrowed the 
images of premature babies or bawling African-American preschoolers to illustrate their crack- 
baby stories. Carol Cole, who taught at the Salvin Special Education School in Los Angeles, 
remembers reporters asking if they could get pictures of the children trembling. 
<p> 
The crack baby quickly became the symbol for the biological determinism recently promulgated in 
its rawest form by Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein in <i>The Bell Curve</i>: These 
(mostly black) bug-eyed morons weren't quite human -- and no amount of attention could make 
them so. In the late '8os, some commentators predicted they would become America's "biologic 
underclass." By 1991, John Silber, president of Boston University, went so far as to lament the 
expenditure of so many health care dollars on "crack babies who won't ever achieve the 
intellectual development to have consciousness of God." 
<p> 
<center><b>EARLY DISSENT</center></b> 
<p> 
Even as news of the "epidemic swept across America, a few of the country's most knowledgeable 
research scientists were beginning to doubt the phenomenon. In Atlanta, Claire Coles, a 
developmental psychologist at Emory University School of Medicine, had graduate students 
watching infants for hours at a time: "You could not distinguish the cocaine-exposed babies from 
the other babies," she says. Nancy Day, an epidemiologist at the University of Pittsburgh School 
of Medicine, stood up at a conference six years ago and admitted she thought the impairments 
researchers were observing were not caused by cocaine. "People," she recalls, "were just aghast." 
At North Central Bronx Hospital. pediatrician and researcher Daniel Neuspiel looked at his own 
data on newborn behavior and concluded that the alarm over crack babies was misguided. 
<p> 
"It really got out of control," says Donald E. Hutchings, a research psychologist and editor of the 
journal <i>Neurotoxicology and Teratology</i>, "because these jerks who didn't know what they 
were talking about were giving press conferences. I'd be sitting at home watching TV and 
suddenly there'd be the intensive care unit in Miami or San Francisco, and what you see is this 
really sick kid who looks like he's about to die and the staff is saying, 'Here's a crack baby'." 
<p> 
But what a few cautious scientists had to say did little to weaken the momentum of the crack- 
baby myth. In fact, researchers who found no or minimal effects from cocaine had a hard time 
getting their results before the public. In a 1989 study published in the <i>Lancet</i>, Canadian 
researcher Gideon Koren showed that papers reporting a cocaine effect in child behavior were 
likely to be accepted over those showing no effect, for presentation at an annual meeting of the 
Society for Pediatric Research -- even when the no-effect studies were of sounder design. "I'd 
never experienced anything like this," says Emory's Claire Coles. "I've never had people accuse 
me of making up data or being an incompetent scientist or believing in drug abuse. When that 
started happening, I started thinking, <i>This is crazy</i>." 
<p> 
<center><b>MYTH IN THE MAKING</center></b> 
<p> 
The earliest and most influential reports of cocaine damage in babies came from the Chicago drug 
treatment clinic of pediatrician Ira Chasnoff. His first study, published in 1985 in <i>The New 
England Journal of Medicine</i>, found that the newborns of 23 cocaine-using women were less 
interactive and moodier than non-cocaine-exposed babies. In the years that followed, Chasnoff 
was widely quoted and fawned over in the press ("positively zenlike," according to Rolling Stone) 
and became known as the rather pessimistic authority on what happens to babies whose mothers 
use cocaine. 
<p> 
Of course, Chasnoff wasn't the only researcher to report serious effects. They were legion, some 
publishing simple case reports that took a few cocaine-exposed kids and racked up their problems. 
Judy Howard, a pediatrician at the University of California, Los Angeles. piped up regularly, once 
telling <i>Newsweek</i> that in crack babies, the part of their brains that "makes us human 
beings, capable of discussion or reflection" had been "wiped out." 
<p> 
Some claims of severe effects -- that cocaine causes a sharp increase in sudden infant death 
syndrome, for example -- were recklessly extrapolated from small samples. But the fundamental 
problem in interpreting the data was a failure to tease apart the effects of prenatal cocaine use 
from the effects of an array of other social and biological burdens that often come as a package 
deal. 
<p> 
<center><b>THE REAL SCIENCE</center></b> 
<p> 
As a group, women who use cocaine while pregnant -- especially those who are likely to get 
noticed as addicts or be tested for drugs in the hospital -- tend also to drink more booze, smoke 
more cigarettes, and dip into a greater variety of illicit drugs than other women. They generally 
have poorer nutrition and overall health, bear and rear their kids in conditions of more profound 
deprivation, and are more persistently exposed to violence than other women. Such burdens 
impact not only their pregnancies, but also the daily lives of their children. Cocaine or no cocaine, 
these kids are more likely than others to have medical, educational, and social difficulties. 
<p> 
No one suggests using cocaine in pregnancy is harmless. But unlike alcohol, which in heavy 
doses can cause a set of birth defects known as fetal alcohol syndrome, cocaine is not associated 
with any pattern of defects. Nor does it produce infantile withdrawal, like opiates. Today there is 
something approaching scientific consensus that cocaine increases the risk of low birthweight and 
perhaps premature delivery. 
<p> 
According to pediatrician Neuspiel, the birthweight decrement attributable to cocaine is roughly 
equivalent to that caused by cigarette smoking. Being premature or underweight is serious 
business for an infant, but the effects are by no means immutable: it's a truism in medicine that 
preemies of rich parents do better than those of poor parents. 
<p> 
While some studies have found abnormalities in behavior among cocaine-exposed newborns, 
others have contradicted them; it appears that neurobehavioral effects are subtle if they occur at 
all. In any case, newborn behavior does not predict what a child will be like at age 3 or 6 or 12. 
A 1992 commentary in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> decried a "rush 
to judgment" about long-term effects of cocaine, concluding that the evidence was "far too slim 
and fragmented to allow any clear predictions about the effects of intrauterine exposure to 
cocaine on the course and outcome of child growth and development." 
<p> 
Even pediatrician Chasnoff began to temper his message as he saw his work used to fan public 
outrage against the very women and children for whom he considered himself an advocate -- and 
as a large group of cocaine-exposed children whom he was following reached their third birthdays 
without apparent cocaine-related intellectual deficits. Now that these children are 6 or so, 
Chasnoff says, they appear normal in the smarts department, but display a "significant increase in 
rates of impulsive behavior, distractibility, [and] aggressive behavior." Is this deviance the result 
of biological damage? The prenatally drug-exposed kids live in the same neighborhoods and go 
to the same schools as the non-drug exposed controls. But their environments differ in this 
important respect: All the mothers of the drug-exposed children have relapsed at least once since 
delivering, and 6o percent are still using. 
<p> 
The Maternal Lifestyles Project, a major study enrolling thousands of women and their infants, 
will likely offer a deeper understanding of cocaine effects within a few years. But to date, no 
researcher, taking into account a child's life experiences, has ever demonstrated that cocaine- 
exposed children are more unruly or any less intelligent than other children. 
<p> 
<center><b>PROVIDE OR PUNISH?</center></b> 
<p> 
The crack-baby myth was so powerful in part because it had something for everyone, whether 
one's ideological leanings called for enhancing public programs to meet the crisis, or for punishing 
the drug-addicted mothers seen as responsible for it. 
<p> 
For some, the assertion that crack babies were in dire trouble became a way of begging funds for 
substance-abusing mothers and their infants. In the late '8os both federal and state governments 
launched expensive projects to study the consequences of prenatal abuse and try out treatment 
strategies for mother and child. When, in 1992, <i>Boston Globe</i> columnist Ellen Goodman 
wrote a piece questioning the basis of the crack-baby scare, Chasnoff got calls from alarmed 
program directors who worried they would lose funding. The public initiative had emphasized the 
need to help substance-abusing women only while pregnant -- as "vessels," as Chasnoff put it. 
Perhaps it was feared that if those vessels no longer threatened to produce a damaged and 
burdensome generation, public interest would falter. 
<p> 
At any rate, it soon became clear that the major thrust of policymaking would be to punish 
mothers who smoked crack. In the late '80s, local prosecutors began busting women who used 
drugs while pregnant or whose newborns tested positive. Between 200 and 300 such women 
have been prosecuted, often under existing child abuse and neglect statutes, and mostly for 
cocaine. Attorney Lynn Pattrow of the Center for Reproductive Law & Policy in New York City 
points out the slippery slope: If you call it child abuse when pregnant women use cocaine, then 
you have to call it abuse when they smoke or drink or engage in any of a host of behaviors that 
are potentially just as dangerous. 
<p> 
Criminal convictions for prenatal drug use, when challenged, have generally failed to stick. Not 
so with actions by the civil child welfare system. Thirteen states require doctors to report drug 
use in pregnancy or positive drug tests in newborns. Nine states specifically define drug use 
during pregnancy as child abuse or neglect, triggering a range of responses from treatment and 
other services to an investigation and the possible removal of the child. The bulk of these policies 
were put in place between 1988 and 1991, as the crack-baby scare peaked. 
<p> 
Some of the policies ostensibly designed to protect cocaine-exposed babies ended up isolating 
them instead. In the late '80s, the practice of automatically keeping newborns in the hospital if 
they tested positive for cocaine, now largely but not universally abandoned, contributed to an 
unmanageable population of boarder babies at some urban hospitals. In New York City, most of 
these babies eventually went home to their families - after languishing in a crowded hospital 
nursery for the dawning weeks or even months of their lives. Of those who stayed in the system, 
according to a study of one six-month period in the mid-'80s, 30 percent still didn't have a 
permanent home by the time they were 3 years old. 
<p> 
<center><b>SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECIES</center></b> 
<p> 
Quite frequently, people present developmental psychologist Dan Griffith with a little person they 
call a crack kid. "Based on that," says Griffith, a private consultant in Park Ridge, Ill., who once 
worked with Chasnoff's group, "I have no idea of what I'm going to see. It tells me nothing about 
the child." 
<p> 
Developmental psychologist Claire Coles, who is also a clinician, has seen "crack babies" who 
were in fact colicky babies. Often, she says, the anti-social behavior attributed to crack-induced 
brain damage is a classic sign of neglect. In her work, for example, she has encountered children 
who ate from the garbage -- not because of brain injury, but because they were not accustomed to 
being fed. 
<p> 
During the height of the crack-baby crisis, experts counseled caretakers to swaddle cocaine- 
exposed infants, keep them in a quiet, dark place, and avoid gazing into their eyes. This makes 
sense for any baby with a raw, easily overstimulated nervous system. But to apply these practices 
to babies who have no symptoms is, in Coles' words, "utter, utter folly." 
<p> 
Griffith, who has seen hundreds of cocaine-exposed children, believes only a few were 
developmentally delayed because their caretakers had deliberately understimulated them from 
infancy. Still one has to wonder, what can a child become when everyone around him braces for 
the worst? Being identified as drug-exposed sometimes gets a child special state-sponsored 
services, but it also carries the potential for stigmatization and self-fulfilling prophecy. 
<p> 
If a child was exposed to drugs in the womb, people now assume the worst. A June 1990 federal 
report explained that would-be adoptive parents were reluctant to take on "crack babies" because 
of their potential long-term problems. Teachers, too, were aghast to learn as the '90s began, that 
they could soon expect the "crack babies" in kindergarten. "The arrival of those first afflicted 
youngsters will mark the beginning of a struggle that will leave your resources depleted and your 
compassion tested," warned an article in <i>The American School Board Journal</i>. 
<p> 
<center><b>THE MYTH'S LEGACY</center></b> 
<p> 
In recent years, the headlines about crack babies have trumpeted the good news: They've beaten 
the odds! There's new hope! But the odds should never have been laid so early, and those 
headlines should read, "Oh God, what have we done?" The publicity blitz that spread the crack- 
baby myth has not been matched by an attempt to unmake the myth---and many, many people still 
believe in it. 
<p> 
Leake and Watts, a large foster care agency in New York City, still refers drug-exposed babies 
and their foster parents to a special program where, even if a child seems just fine, he is closely 
watched. Last year, in a segment about an ongoing legal challenge to a South Carolina hospital 
that had newly delivered mothers hauled off to jail if their infants tested positive for cocaine, "60 
Minutes" showed sick babies, implying that their problems were cocaine-related (while claiming 
legal considerations precluded identifying exactly which babies were cocaine-exposed). Only a 
few months ago in a <i>New York Times Magazine</i> piece entitled "It's Drugs, Stupid," 
Joseph Califano Jr., a former secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, wrote that "crack 
babies" can cost $1 million apiece to bring to adulthood, and suggested that the children of 
addicted welfare mothers who "refuse" treatment be put in orphanages or foster care. 
<p> 
In some professional circles, the term "crack baby" has given way to "drug-exposed baby." But 
even layered over with euphemism, however gently its promulgators protest their good intentions, 
the meaning of the crack-baby epithet is clear. It means we can blame the problems of the least 
privileged children on the unnatural conduct of their mothers. It means we can all rest easy in the 
futility of giving our time and money to feed, house, educate, and love these children, whose 
failings are inborn and past remedy. 
<p> 
<center><b>AT A FAMOUS TREATMENT HOUSE, THE ANTIDOTE<br> 
IS HUGS AND KISSES AND WARM BOTTLES</center></b> 
<p> 
Ronald Reagan made Hale House famous in 1985 when he called its founder, Clara Hale, an 
angel. It is one of the places that produced poster children for the crack-baby crisis. A 1990 
<i>New York Post</i> series entitled "Children of the Damned" shows a little brown face peering 
from between the slats of his crib, captioned "A 2 1/2-year-old crack child at Hale House," and 
quotes Mother Hale as grieving "a lost generation." Today, literature sent to potential 
contributors claims most of the children were born "craving crack." 
<p> 
Inside it's a different story. It was 25 years ago, long before crack when Mother Hale took in the 
baby of a nodding heroin junkie and within two months found herself caring for 22 infants in her 
modest Harlem apartment. In considering this history, one begins to understand that Mother 
Hale's "lost generation" may not have referred to brain damage, but to a bewildering social 
disjuncture. 
<p> 
Since Clara Hale's death in 1992, her daughter Dr. Lorraine Hale, who helped found Hale House, 
has continued to run it. Dr. Hale thinks the crack-exposed kids are moodier than heroin-exposed 
kids. But she's not much interested in the cause of their problems, and the program here isn't 
heavy on complex child evaluations. It is privately supported and tries simply to give as much 
basic care and hugging and kissing as possible and to promote contact between children and 
parents, who leave their kids there voluntarily. 
<p> 
This winter day, six infants are upstairs at Hale House. Three lie in their cribs; one sits in a tiny 
chair, a strap across his belly; another two are cradled in the arms of staff giving them their 
bottles. Dr. Hale approaches the middle crib and tickles its occupant, who laughs delightedly. In 
the next crib an infant is hollering, arching his back, his cheeks flushing red; when Hale picks him 
up, he quiets instantly. The fact these babies might have been subtly damaged by their mother's 
cocaine use seems to recede in significance next to the gaping hole in their lives -- the lack of a 
single passionate adult who could coo and chat and laugh and cradle for as long as the two of 
them liked. 
<p> 
<center><b>DANIEL IN THE LION'S DEN</center></b> 
<p> 
Daniel was -- is -- what some would call a "crack baby." When Janine, a 42-year-old African- 
American volunteer at a Manhattan public hospital, first laid eyes on him in the boarder-baby 
nursery, he was tiny and asymmetrical; at 4 months, he looked like a newborn. Janine started 
visiting Daniel every day, and when he reached 10 months, brought him home with her and set 
about formally adopting him. Today, greeting a visitor at the door of his mother's comfortable 
home in an unassuming neighborhood in southern Westchester, he is a fine boy of 4, slender but 
of average height, with shining eyes. 
<p> 
Although Janine learned not to look for failure in Daniel, others dwelled on his drug exposure. 
The first school she took him to for enrollment saw a black adopted child and asked, "Is he drug- 
exposed?" Janine claimed she didn't know. The second, a preschool special education program, 
proved more problematic. "This school knew, and it was written up in all the evaluations," says 
Janine, her voice rising angrily at the recollection. "Everything was related to his history. 
<p> 
"At 2, he could count up to 20. He was beginning to learn how to count in Spanish by the time he 
was 3. He knew his alphabet. But the school reports were absolutely horrifying. I mean, it wasn't 
the same child. According to them, he couldn't repeat two numbers consecutively, he couldn't 
turn the pages of a book, he couldn't hold a pair of scissors.

Burma junta targets computer links </H1>
<p>
<p>
RANGOON, Burma, Sept. 27 (UPI) - Burma's military government has imposed a new
law providing a jail term of up to 15 years to anyone who imports, uses or
possesses a computer modem or fax machine without government permission, an
official said Friday. <p>
The Computer Science Development Law empowers the Ministry of Communications,
Posts and Telegraphs to determine the types of computer equipment to be
restricted, according to official media.  The Myanmar (Burma) Computer Science
Council will be appointed under the new law and empowered to approve the types
of equipment to be restricted.  <p>
Analysts said the law appeared to be specifically aimed at restricting the use
of internal modems and fax modems that are included with many new computers.
They said the law reflected the dilemma of the State Law and Order  Restoration
Council, which wants to modernize the country's fledgling computer industry
while restricting the flow of political information.  <p>
Under the new law, anyone who imports, keeps or uses the restricted equipment
without the ministry's "prior sanction" will be punished with a prison term of
from seven to 15 year and or a fine.  The government-run newspaper New Light of
Myanmar said the same punishment is prescribed for anyone who sets up a link
with a computer network without the prior permission of the ministry, or who
uses computer network and information technology for undermining state
security, law and order, national unity, national economy and national culture,
or who obtains or transmits state secrets.  A lesser punishment of between five
and 10 years in prison is laid down for anyone who imports and exports computer
software or information banned by the Myanmar Computer Science Council.  In
July an honorary consul for several European countries, Leo Nichols, died in
prison after he was sentenced to a lengthy term for illegal possession of fax
machines.  The death of Nichols, an Anglo-Burmese, triggered an avalanche of
criticism from the European Union.  The ruling junta controls all mass media
and has attempted to ensure the limited access to the Internet available in the
country does not provide unwelcome political information to Burmese or a
channel for providing information about internal conditions to the outside
world.  <p>

<H2>Executive Summary </H2> 
 
<P> 
 
The &quot;War on Drugs&quot; does not make the daily headlines 
as it once did, but the tragic reality remains that drug abuse 
and related violence continue to tear at the fabric of U.S. society. 
Since 1990, the federal government alone has spent more than $70 
billion on drug control. Yet more drugs are available at lower 
prices and higher quality than ever before, and drug abuse remains 
widespread. As policymakers search for effective solutions to 
the very real problem of drug abuse, meaningful debate threatens 
to deteriorate into a rhetorical war as both the new Congress 
and the Clinton administration seek to out-do one another in devising 
&quot;get tough&quot; policies to combat drug trafficking. 
<P> 
The escalating war of words in Washington threatens to fuel a 
dramatically failed drug control policy - one with harmful side-effects 
in the Andean countries of Bolivia, Colombia and Peru, where U. 
S. international drug control efforts are focused. The emphasis 
on attacking the supply-side rather than the demand-side of the 
narcotics industry and the focus on these &quot;source&quot; countries 
are based on fundamentally flawed assumptions about the coca and 
cocaine markets. Differences in opinion about root causes and 
solutions coupled with high-level corruption within source country 
governments - including the very police and military forces charged 
with carrying out antinarcotics programs - are exacerbating the 
tension between the United States and the Andean countries. As 
a result, effective cooperation with our Andean counterparts remains 
elusive. 
<P> 
U. S. anti-drug efforts in the Andes are not only ineffective 
- they may in fact be doing more harm than good. U. S. antinarcotics 
efforts have the harmful side-effect of forging closer U.S. links 
to abusive police and military forces in the Andes. In Peru and 
Colombia, U.S. assistance is provided to the security forces who 
are among the worst human rights violators in the hemisphere. 
In Bolivia, the drug war is generating political instability and 
heightening social conflict. In summary, U.S. international drug 
control efforts appear to be undermining other important U.S. 
policy goals of promoting human rights and democracy.

<P> 
Former President Bush responded to the spread of crack-cocaine 
in the 1980s by elevating the policy to a national &quot;war,&quot; 
calling for &quot;an assault on every front&quot; in September 
1989. The frontline of the war became the Andean &quot;source&quot; 
countries of Peru, Bolivia and Colombia. Bush's Andean Initiative 
called for $2.2 billion over five years, initially comprised primarily 
of military and police assistance. The Pentagon was assigned a 
major role in waging the drug war in Latin America. 
<P> 
The Clinton administration is under fire from the new Congress 
and others for this policy failure. In fact, President Clinton 
has largely continued the policies laid out by his predecessor. 
Despite much rhetoric early in his administration about the need 
to spend more on demand-side efforts (such as treatment and education) 
and less on supply-side efforts (such as local law enforcement 
and eradication and interdiction in the Andes), the ratio of government 
spending on demand and supply-side efforts remains largely the 
same. The administration's 1996 budget request of $14.6 billion 
allocates about 65 percent of federal resources to supply-side 
efforts, a mere 5 percent less than the average during Bush's 
tenure. For international programs, the administration has requested 
$399.1 million, a 28 percent increase over that approved by Congress 
for fiscal year 1995. 
<P> 
The war on drugs in Washington has escalated as both the new Republican 
majority in Congress and the Clinton administration seek to prove 
who can be toughest in combating drug trafficking. Last December, 
Senators Bob Dole (R-KS) and Orrin Hatch (R-UT) wrote to &quot;Drug 
Czar&quot; Lee Brown, head of the Office of National Drug Control 
Policy, accusing the Clinton administration of &quot;decreased 
prosecutions, increased hand-wringing about treatment and hard-core 
addicts, retreat on interdiction efforts, and an abandoned bully 
pulpit.&quot; All of these, in their opinion, have led to policy 
failure. In his January 12, 1995 response, Brown pointed out: 
&quot;We put 3,000 more criminals behind bars in 1993 than the 
prior administration did in 1992. Furthermore, we increased by 
more than 800 the number of serious criminals receiving long prison 
terms of more than 5 years.&quot; In hearings this spring, one 
Congressional leader called for the U.S. military to forcibly 
spray herbicides over coca fields in Bolivia and Peru, regardless 
of the opposition of those governments. Meanwhile, the administration 
refused to grant full certification of cooperation with antinarcotics 
efforts to its three key allies in the Andes - Peru, Bolivia and 
Colombia. 
<P> 
While lack of resources is often cited as the reason for policy 
failure, significant U.S. funds have gone to at least one key 
country in the drug war: Colombia. The United States spent more 
than $500 million over the last five years in Colombia alone, 
according to State Department estimates, not including costly 
Pentagon and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operations. U.S. 
agents from more than a dozen agencies assist anti-drug efforts 
in that country. <A NAME="back1" HREF="#note1">(1)</A> 
The Colombian government itself invested billions more in the 
drug war. Until recently, Colombia was cited as the model of effective 
cooperation. Yet the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) claims 
that today Colombia produces more cocaine and heroin than it did 
in 1989. <A NAME="back2" HREF="#note2">(2)</A> Now accused 
by some U.S. officials of functioning as a &quot;narco-democracy,&quot; 
the experience of the drug war in Colombia provides stark evidence 
of the failure of U.S. policy, even under the most optimistic 
scenario of resource availability and shared political will.

<A HREF="#contents">(Return to Table of Contents)</A> 
<P> 
More than five years after the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; was announced 
by President Bush, no significant dent has been made in the flow 
of illicit drugs across U.S. borders. As Drug Czar Lee Brown pointed 
out in recent Congressional testimony: 
<P> 
&quot;Drugs are readily available to anyone who wants to buy them. 
Cocaine and heroin street prices are low and purity is high - 
making use more feasible and affordable than ever. Marijuana is 
increasingly available, potent and cheap - enticing a new generation 
of users.&quot; <A NAME="back3" HREF="#note3">(3)</A> 
<P> 
More drugs are available at lower price and higher quality than 
ever before. Statistics show casual drug use once again on the 
rise, and hardcore drug use remains widespread. 
<P> 
The Clinton administration is under fire from the new Congress 
and others who blame it for letting the war wane. In fact, historically, 
drug use fluctuates as it has over the last decade and causality 
is difficult, if not impossible, to discern. Most importantly, 
more than five years after the Bush administration elevated U.S. 
drug control efforts to an international crusade, close examination 
reveals a dramatic policy failure - caused not by lack of resources 
or political will, but by a fundamentally flawed supply-side strategy. 
<P> 
As international drug control efforts have failed to achieve the 
desired results, the focus of U.S. policy has shifted from source 
country efforts to transit countries and, with the Clinton administration, 
back to the source countries. Like his predecessor William Bennett, 
Drug Czar Brown likes to point to the greater visibility and vulnerability 
of drugs at the source of production, i.e., in the Andean countries 
of Peru, Bolivia and Colombia. Source country strategies focus 
both on eradicating coca plants (when mixed with chemicals it 
can be processed into cocaine) and interdicting cocaine base and 
cocaine before the journey begins towards the United States. Both 
efforts - eradication and interdiction - have borne little if 
any fruit to date. 
<P> 
Drug policy analysts often compare drug production to a balloon: 
squeezing it in one area merely causes it to pop up in another. 
This is precisely what has happened, for example, with coca production 
in Peru. Coca plants that used to be confined to Peru's Upper 
Huallaga Valley are now found throughout the lower and middle 
Huallaga Valleys; the Ene Perene, and Ucayali valleys in the central 
jungle; the Apurimac River Valley, La Convencion in the department 
of Cuzco - and beyond. Coca production has exploded in Colombia, 
which now rivals Bolivia as the second largest producer in the 
world (after Peru), and poppy cultivation for heroin production 
is on the rise as well. Poppies are also spreading rapidly throughout 
Peru. 
<P> 
Simple laws of supply and demand work against crop eradication 
programs. If eradication succeeds in a given area, the supply 
of coca is reduced and the price is driven up, thereby creating 
even greater incentives for increased production and for new producers 
to enter the market. Local peasants, eking out a subsistence level 
wage, find that coca offers the greatest comparative advantage: 
The plant grows in poor soil, yields up to four or five crops 
each year, requires little infrastructure, is light and easy to 
transport and offers the highest return compared to available 
alternatives. The potential for coca expansion in the Andes far 
outstrips the ability of antinarcotics forces to reduce, let alone 
curtail, production. 
<P> 
The administration's own statistics provide clear evidence of 
the balloon theory. According to the State Department's 1995 International 
Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR), metric tons of coca 
leaf produced decreased a mere 1.03 percent between 1989 and 1994. 
Moreover, U.S. government statistics also show that current coca 
cultivation in Latin America could yield three times the amount 
of cocaine presently produced. <A NAME="back4" HREF="#note4">(4)</A> 
In other words, even if the coca supply were reduced by two-thirds 
- an impossible feat given past track records - there would still 
be sufficient coca to maintain the present cocaine supply. 
<P> 
A similar trend has occurred with cocaine production and trafficking. 
With the crack-down on Colombia's Medellin cartel, the Cali cartel 
has grown in prominence in what Colombian analysts refer to as 
the &quot;democratization&quot; of drug trafficking. No longer 
confined to Colombia, drug mafias are proliferating in Bolivia, 
Peru, Brazil, Venezuela and other countries. For the first time, 
cocaine itself is being fabricated in Peru. Also for the first 
time, heroin trafficking has become a major problem in Latin America. 
There is no evidence that the amount of cocaine crossing U.S. 
borders has decreased since the drug war was launched. In fact, 
the INCSR conspicuously avoids comparing figures of estimated 
production with seizures. 
<P> 
More than five years into the Andean Initiative, the administration 
can neither point to successes nor provide the framework for defining 
success. The administration has yet to develop evaluation indicators 
for international drug control programs, despite repeated calls 
by the U.S. Congress for it to do so. As has been promised for 
the past several years, the 1995 National Drug Control Strategy 
(NDCS) lists as one of its goals &quot;to develop measures of 
effectiveness for international, host country, and interdiction 
programs.&quot; 
<hr> 
<H2><A NAME="item3"></A>&quot;Political Will&quot; Remains Elusive</H2> 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents">(Return to Table of Contents)</A> 
<P> 
Moreover, the administration still complains that it does not 
enjoy effective antinarcotics cooperation with the three countries 
essential to its source-country approach. Each year, the administration 
must &quot;certify&quot; to Congress that countries receiving 
U.S. antinarcotics assistance are cooperating with U.S. efforts. 
On March 1, 1995, the administration denied full certification 
to Colombia, Peru and Bolivia; instead they were made eligible 
for continued U.S. assistance through &quot;national security 
waivers.&quot; Colombia, long presented as the closest U.S. ally 
in the Andes, came under the harshest attack. 
<P> 
Lack of political will on the part of the Andean countries is 
often cited as an obstacle to effective U.S. anti-drug efforts 
since the Andean initiative was first announced. Heightened tensions 
between the Andean and U.S. governments may ensure that such cooperation 
never gets off the ground. During Congressional hearings on March 
29, l99S, Rep. Dan Burton (R-IN), new chairman of the House Western 
Hemisphere Subcommittee, proposed that the United States place 
an aircraft carrier off the coast of Peru and Bolivia and forcibly 
spray coca fields with herbicides despite the opposition of those 
governments. Apart from fanning Bolivia's long-standing interest 
in regaining territory that would give it access to the sea (it 
is presently land-locked), Bolivians in particular were outraged 
and newspaper headlines across the country declared a U.S. invasion 
imminent. Statements such as these and incessant attacks by Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms (R-NC) and others 
on the Colombian government in particular are generating an anti-American 
backlash in the region. 
<P> 
The certification process and the Clinton administration's heightened 
criticisms and threats of sanctions if more progress is not made 
have also strained relations. Assistant Secretary of State Robert 
Gelbard's <A NAME="back5" HREF="#note5">(5)</A> outright 
rejection of calls by Peru, Bolivia, Colombia and Paraguay for 
a regional anti-drug summit prompted outcries from the four countries. 
Many analysts and officials in the Andes feel that the certification 
process is based solely on U.S. criteria, which does not take 
into account the high cost in lives and resources that these countries 
have paid in the drug war. They also tend to view the problem 
of drug production from a different angle, pointing to the economic 
roots of both coca production and the cocaine industry and the 
need to complement law enforcement efforts with economic development 
and assistance. For example, successive Bolivian and Peruvian 
presidents have argued that coca growers should not be treated 
as criminals, as viewed by many in the U.S. government, but as 
poor farmers seeking to provide a subsistence-level income for 
their families. Sustainable development projects, not eradication, 
are pointed to as the means of stemming coca production. The proposed 
summit could provide an important means of furthering understanding 
between the U.S. and Andean countries on these differing strategies. 
<P> 
Andean governments and public opinion often claim that the United 
States should share the burden more by putting more resources 
and effort into confronting the problem of drug consumption, which 
they view as the &quot;source,&quot; or root of the drug production 
problem. In his acceptance speech after winning Peru's April 9 
presidential elections, Alberto Fujimori spoke out harshly against 
U.S. drug policy, and Gelbard in particular, pointing to the need 
to control consumption in the United States: &quot;I ask myself 
what would happen if, with a magic wand, we suddenly cut off all 
exports (of drugs). Probably, it would produce a great convulsion 
in countries that are consumers.&quot; <A NAME="back6" HREF="#note6">(6)</A> 
<hr> 
<H2><A NAME="item4"></A>Renewed Emphasis on Peru</H2> 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents">(Return to Table of Contents)</A> 
<P> 
President Fujimori often refers to the U.S. drug war as a &quot;disaster,&quot; 
as he reiterated most recently the night before the hemispheric 
summit in Miami. <A NAME="back7" HREF="#note7">(7)</A> 
Despite Fujimori's statements, Peru is now the focus of U.S. antinarcotics 
efforts. In Congressional testimony earlier this year, General 
Barry McCaffrey, Commander in Chief of the U.S. Southern Command, 
stated, &quot;SOUTHCOM believes we can be more successful by focusing 
our support in Peru.&quot; <A NAME="back8" HREF="#note8">(8)</A> 
Assistant Secretary Gelbard, Drug Czar Lee Brown and other officials 
have echoed this statement. Yet possibilities for &quot;success&quot; 
in Peru are more remote than ever before. 
<P> 
Ironically, Peru is the only country in the hemisphere to have 
knowingly forced down a U.S. plane on an antinarcotics mission. 
In April 1992, the Peruvian armed forces shot at a U.S. C-130 
Hercules plane, killing one U. S. soldier and wounding two others. 
Investigations by the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) 
revealed that the order to shoot came from the highest levels 
of the Peruvian Air Force and that it was clear to the Peruvian 
military that the target was indeed a U.S. plane. Adding insult 
to injury, the Peruvian military then presented the U.S. government 
with a bill (subsequently withdrawn) for $20,000 to cover its 
costs in attacking and repairing the plane and treating the wounded 
Americans. Shortly after the attack and the April 1992 presidential 
coup, the U.S. Congress rescinded fiscal year 1992 military aid 
to Peru and has banned it every year since. 
<P> 
The Clinton administration now cites the Peruvian Air Force's 
drug interdiction program as a success story. It also highlights 
increased cocaine seizures in Peru as an example of progress, 
while failing to point out that cocaine production in that country 
is a new phenomenon and increased seizures are in fact evidence 
of the failure of U. S. anti-drug efforts to date. Unfortunately, 
the few gains that have been made as a result of the air interdiction 
program and seizures are more than offset by the problem of pervasive 
corruption among the Peruvian military and police. 
<P> 
Investigating corruption in Peru is a risky business - one that 
few journalists are willing to take on. In its report on attacks 
on the press in 1994, the Committee to Protect Journalists notes: 
<P> 
&quot;Reporting on drug trafficking is still the most dangerous 
and difficult assignment for Peruvian journalists. In the interior, 
dozens of journalists received threats and faced lawsuits for 
publishing or broadcasting reports on alleged connections between 
civilian and military officials and drug traffickers.&quot; 
<P> 
Despite the dangers, more and more information on corruption has 
been revealed from within the Peruvian army itself by disgruntled 
personnel who fear the long-term impact of corruption on the military 
as an institution. The increasing powers granted to the military 
under the Fujimori government and the lack of public accountability 
have fostered a climate allowing corruption to flourish, particularly 
since the April 1992 coup. 
<hr> 
<H2><A NAME="item5"></A>Pervasive Corruption in Peruvian Security Forces</H2> 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents">(Return to Table of Contents)</A> 
<P> 
The 1995 NDCS praises Peru for the prosecution of drug kingpin 
Carlos Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera (El Vaticano), who was captured 
in Colombia and extradited to Peru. The report fails to point 
out, however, that he was tried and convicted to a 30-year prison 
term, not for drug trafficking but for collaborating with the 
Shining Path guerrillas. The trial took place in a secret military 
court, avoiding public scrutiny as would have been the case in 
a narcotics case (which could have carried the same sentence). 
Peruvian analysts believe that the military deliberately avoided 
a public trial of El Vaticano in order to cover up evidence of 
high-level corruption that would have emerged. 
<P> 
Following that trial, a number of military personnel went public 
with detailed information on drug trafficking-related corruption 
within the army and police. In testimony before the Peruvian Congress, 
Captain Gilmar Valdivieso Rejas provided one of the most extensive 
accounts. He alleges that the former army commander of the Huallaga 
region, General Eduardo Bellido, provided cover for narcotics 
operations. Valdivieso also testified that in 1992, Lieutenant 
Colonel Luis Aparicio Manrique had the engineers of the Upper 
Huallaga Special Project (PEAH) build a clandestine landing strip 
in Canuto, presumably to facilitate drug flights, and that Peruvian 
army helicopters were sometimes used to transport drugs. Valdivieso, 
now in hiding, is being sued by the army for &quot;insult to his 
superiors, disobedience, abuse of authority, and false testimony.&quot; 
<A NAME="back9" HREF="#note9">(9)</A> 
<P> 
Only one army General has been prosecuted: General Jaime Araico 
who was military commander of the Huallaga region in 1991 and 
1992. On January l9, 1995 he was found guilty of allowing cocaine 
to be transported to Colombia from Peruvian airstrips under his 
control. During the trial, the judge ordered General Bellido (his 
successor in the Huallaga front) to appear before the court. However, 
the present Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, General Nicolas 
de Bari Hermoza Rios, has refused to allow Bellido to testify 
in this or any of the other cases in which he has been implicated. 
Bellido conveniently now serves as Military Attache in Israel. 
<P> 
Evidence such as this points to corruption at the highest levels 
of the Peruvian armed forces. Most recently, the Andean Commission 
of Jurists in Lima, Peru reports that: &quot;The Jan. 12, 1995 
discovery of the largest shipment of cocaine in Peruvian history 
uncovered the possibility of connections between the traffickers 
and corrupt elements within several government institutions.&quot; 
<A NAME="back10" HREF="#note10">(10)</A> A diary belonging 
to one of the 38 suspected drug traffickers captured, Jose Luis 
Mendiola, details meetings with General Manuel Ortiz Lucero, a 
member of the Armed Forces Internal Command Front, and Police 
Major Edwin Burgos, who works in the Central Operations Department. 
Other evidence obtained links the traffickers to the Vice Minister 
of the Interior, Edgar Solis, and General Hermoza's brother. 
<P> 
In its national drug plan announced last October, the Peruvian 
government charges the military with primary responsibility for 
antinarcotics operations. With the near defeat of the Shining 
Path, combating drug trafficking provides a rationale (and, as 
noted above, lucrative opportunities) for continuing the Peruvian 
military's excessive prerogatives and powers. The recent border 
conflict with Ecuador has changed that scenario significantly. 
Despite overwhelming support in Peru for the armed forces' actions, 
there has been increasing criticism of its inability to inflict 
more damage on the Ecuadoran military despite its superior equipment 
and numbers. The military has also been criticized for lack of 
attention to the gradual Ecuadoran military build-up in territory 
claimed by Peru. Although a cease-fire is in place, the deep-rooted 
conflict is not likely to end anytime soon. Hence, the Peruvian 
military's primary attention is likely to remain focused on the 
border, far from the central jungle drug trafficking regions.

<A HREF="#contents">(Return to Table of Contents)</A> 
<P> 
Despite evidence to the contrary, on April 4, 1995 in hearings 
before the Senate Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, Brian Sheridan, 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Drug Enforcement Policy 
and Support, stated surprisingly: &quot;The government of Peru 
has shown renewed political will against narcotrafficking with 
President Fujimori emphasizing counternarcotics as the Peruvian 
military's #1 mission.&quot; Just days later, in his acceptance 
address Fujimori took the opposite position, criticizing calls 
in Washington for more military action against drug trafficking.

In its Fiscal Year 1996 Congressional Presentation for Foreign 
Operations, the administration states its intention to provide 
assistance to the Peruvian Air Force and Navy and to resume International 
Military Education and Training (IMET) in Peru (suspended since 
the 1992 coup). The administration also states its &quot;assumption&quot; 
that military assistance to Peru will be resumed in 1995 - a particularly 
disturbing assumption given that the U.S. Congress has explicitly 
prohibited military aid to Peru every year since 1992. The provision 
of military aid to Peru would not further U.S. antinarcotics objectives 
for the reasons laid out above. Moreover, it would be highly inappropriate 
given the ongoing conflict with Ecuador and Peru's dismal human 
rights record. 
<P> 
As one of the four guarantors of the Rio Protocol (the treaty 
which provides the framework for resolving the Peru-Ecuador border 
dispute), the U.S. government has played a very positive role 
in promoting a peaceful and long-term solution to the conflict. 
The guarantor countries, including the United States, have called 
on the international community to refrain from sending arms to 
either country. Although U.S. military assistance would ostensibly 
be destined for the central jungle region, the provision of such 
aid would send a dangerous message to other countries that have 
supplied weapons to Peru and Ecuador. Ecuador would undoubtedly 
interpret the aid as showing a bias toward Peru, which would hinder 
the U. S. diplomatic role as one of the guarantor countries. Aid 
to the Peruvian Air Force would reportedly include spare parts 
for A-37 aircraft, which were used in the conflict. 
<P> 
Potential aid to the Peruvian Navy is even more problematic. It 
would likely be used to support the Peruvian Navy's base in Puccallpa, 
presently used as a base for U.S. antinarcotics forces in the 
region. Last year, Peruvian human rights groups documented more 
cases of disappearance following detention by state agents in 
the Ucayali department - 13 of 30 cases - than in any other area 
of the country. Puccallpa is the main base of the Navy in the 
Ucayali department, which is under a state of emergency and officially 
under the Navy's command. The Fujimori government has consistently 
failed to meet human rights-related requirements laid out by the 
U.S. Congress in order to receive U.S. security assistance.

<P> 
U.S. drug policy, if escalated along the lines currently being 
discussed, could worsen the already tragic human rights situations 
in both Peru and Colombia. <A NAME="back12" HREF="#note12">(12)</A> 
Although human rights violations in Peru have decreased significantly, 
they continue to occur with disturbing frequency. Anti-terrorist 
legislation decreed by Fujimori after the April 1992 coup led 
to the imprisonment of thousands of Peruvians on terrorist charges 
whose cases have been heard in military and &quot;faceless&quot; 
civilian tribunals which violate the most fundamental due process 
guarantees. The plight of the unjustly detained and convicted 
in Peru are now at the crux of the human rights problem. In Colombia, 
an estimated 10 people a day are killed as a result of political 
violence. In those cases in which responsibility can be determined, 
70 percent of political assassinations are attributed to the Colombian 
security forces or their paramilitary allies. According to U.S. 
legislation linking security assistance to the human rights practices 
of recipient governments (Section 502b of the Foreign Assistance 
Act of 1961 as amended), both countries should be prohibited from 
receiving U.S. antinarcotics-related security assistance unless 
a national security waiver is issued. 
<P> 
The Clinton administration does recognize the importance of promoting 
human rights and democracy in order to further broader U.S. policy 
goals and U.S. antinarcotics goals. In a particularly revealing 
statement, the 1995 NDCS notes that: 
<P> 
&quot;The Administration has recognized the history of alleged 
human rights abuses, emphatically condemns such practices, and 
intends to ensure that such abuses are not continued by any country 
which receives U.S. counternarcotics assistance, especially if 
that assistance is being used for purposes other than for which 
it was intended.&quot; <A NAME="back13" HREF="#note13">(13)</A> 
<P> 
In its tacit admission that U.S. counternarcotics funds may be 
diverted to counterinsurgency efforts, the administration recognizes 
the real and tragic possibility that U.S. drug policy may be fueling 
human rights violations stemming from those efforts. 
<P> 
Despite this possibility, the Clinton administration is pursuing 
efforts to provide military assistance to Peru, as discussed above, 
and has again requested fiscal year 1996 assistance for the Colombian 
army. In the summer of 1994, the U.S. Congress strongly objected 
to any U.S. funding for the Colombian army because of its human 
rights record. The administration will be hard pressed to live 
up to its word of ensuring that no human rights violations occur 
in Peru or Colombia. 
<hr> 
<H2><A NAME="item8"></A>The Bolivian Quagmire</H2> 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents">(Return to Table of Contents)</A> 
<P> 
The legacy of more than a decade of U.S.-backed antinarcotics 
efforts in Bolivia has been the fostering of significant social 
unrest and political upheaval. Many Bolivian analysts would argue 
that democracy has continued to take root despite the drug war, 
not because of it as the administration claims. Forced eradication 
efforts in February 1994 and &quot;Operation New Dawn&quot; sparked 
violent confrontations between coca growers and government forces. 
The U.S. government provided logistical support for Operation 
New Dawn, which began last summer in an attempt to meet U.S. eradication 
targets necessary to receive U.S. assistance. Although no major 
drug traffickers were apprehended, over 700 local farmers were 
detained for not having the proper identity papers. One extrajudicial 
execution was extensively documented. A government campaign was 
launched accusing local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) 
of agitating protests and violence, resulting in the expulsion 
of several foreigners from the country and forcing many Bolivian 
NGO activists into hiding. Finally, protest marches against the 
operation were suppressed by the Bolivian army and police, leading 
to hundreds of arrests and injuries. 
<P> 
Tensions in the Chapare coca producing region are at their highest 
point ever as a result of U.S. demands that the Bolivian government 
eradicate 1,750 hectares of coca by the end of June or face U.S. 
sanctions equivalent to decertification. <A NAME="back14" HREF="#note14">(14)</A> 
The United States is also demanding that the Bolivian government 
sign an extradition treaty and develop a reasonable plan for short, 
medium and long-term coca eradication. The Bolivian government 
has never carried out successful forced eradication because of 
strong resistance by local federations and exceptional means will 
have to be employed if it is to do so now. Thus, for the first 
time, the Bolivian army is likely to confront local peasants in 
the Chapare region as a result of efforts to meet the U.S. target. 
<P> 
Whether the United States likes it or not, the coca growers are 
a formidable political force in Bolivia. Moreover, U.S. anti-drug 
policies have always been highly unpopular throughout the country 
and demands such as the ones presently in force are viewed as 
direct - and unwanted - U.S. intervention. At the same time, Bolivia 
is extremely dependent on international, and U.S., assistance. 
As a result, successive Bolivian governments have sought to placate 
the U.S. government, while trying to avoid committing political 
suicide. An endless cycle has been put in place: eradication targets 
are set, failure to meet them results in U.S. pressure and eventually 
extension of target deadlines, followed again by half-hearted 
efforts to comply. This political survival strategy appears to 
be no longer viable; ultimately this could mean that U.S. drug 
policy will undermine the Sanchez de Lozada government. 
<hr> 
<H2><A NAME="item9"></A>Democratic Institution Building</H2> 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents">(Return to Table of Contents)</A> 
<P> 
The Clinton administration's international drug strategy emphasizes 
&quot;democratic institution building&quot; as a cornerstone of 
U.S. policy; however, the institutions it has chosen to focus 
on are local police and military forces. Assistant Secretary Robert 
Gelbard went one step further in recent Congressional testimony, 
noting: &quot;For the producer countries, institution-building 
also means the development and implementation for the first time 
of comprehensive strategies to eliminate narcotics crop production.&quot; 
<A NAME="back15" HREF="#note15">(15)</A> The precise 
ways in which eradication efforts serve to strengthen democratic 
institutions has not been explained. 
<P> 
The region's beleaguered judiciaries - central to a strategy for 
supporting democratic institutions - have in practice received 
little assistance. Of the $137 million requested <A NAME="back16" HREF="#note16">(16)</A> 
for next year's counternarcotics programs in Peru, Bolivia and 
Colombia, only $4.4 million is slated for judicial protection 
and reform ($4 million of that is for Bolivia alone), while police 
and military units are designated to receive $75.3 million. Even 
the small Rule of Law (ROL) program to support Andean judiciaries 
may be doing more harm than good, a trend likely to accelerate 
if funding is consolidated under the State Department's narcotics 
bureau as proposed in the fiscal year 1996 budget request. 
<P> 
The Agency for International Development's (AID) ROL program is 
designed to provide support for democratic, civilian institutions 
and offers the best potential among existing U.S. aid programs 
for meeting the administration's stated objective of strengthening 
democracy. In the case of the Andean region, however, the ROL 
program has a very poor track record to date: Anti-drug laws passed 
in Bolivia and public order courts in Colombia (now called regional 
courts) have eliminated fundamental due process guarantees as 
laid out in international human rights covenants. In by-passing 
the ordinary court system, special antinarcotics courts do not 
serve the long-term interest of strengthening the judiciary. In 
neither case have they achieved the desired goal of speeding up 
drug trials and convictions. In fact, rampant corruption continues 
to ensure that poor detainees remain in jail for years awaiting 
trial, while drug traffickers can afford the bribes necessary 
to obtain immediate release or, in the case of Colombia, can benefit 
from lenient plea bargaining arrangements. 
<hr> 
<H2><A NAME="item10"></A>Conclusions and Policy Recommendations</H2> 
<P> 
<A HREF="#contents">(Return to Table of Contents)</A> 
<P> 
The Andean Initiative has been based from the outset on flawed 
assumptions about the forces and markets governing the supply 
of illicit drugs and relies excessively on military and police 
forces to carry out &quot;military law enforcement&quot; as the 
strategy's linchpin. That view is not shared by all in the administration: 
General Barry McCaffrey, Commander in Chief of the U.S. Southern 
Command, has stated that the military is &quot;not the most appropriate 
tool&quot; to fight drug trafficking, pointing to legislation 
and prosecution of criminals as the best means to confront the 
drug problem abroad.) <A NAME="back17" HREF="#note17">(17)</A> 
Despite its rhetoric to the contrary, the Clinton administration 
has yet to learn one of the most basic lessons of Latin American 
history - that the role of Latin American military and police 
forces must be diminished, not expanded further, if democracy 
is to flourish in the region. 
<P> 
To its credit, the Clinton administration has placed much more 
emphasis on the economic roots of coca and cocaine production 
and the need for effective economic development to wean countries 
off illicit drug production. Its fiscal year 1996 budget request 
includes $47 million for sustainable development activities in 
Bolivia, Peru and Colombia. The new Congress, on the other hand, 
has shown little interest in funding these important programs, 
which may bear the brunt of foreign aid reductions to the Andean 
region. The Clinton administration has also made the important 
linkage between effective antinarcotics control and promoting 
democracy. It has not, however, shown the same generosity in assigning 
funding for democratic institution building initiatives oriented 
towards judiciaries other civilian institutions and sectors of 
civil society that offer the greatest potential for strengthening 
democracy. 
<HR> 
<A NAME="item11"></A> 
<H4>With regards to U S international drug policy toward the Andes, 
WOLA makes the following policy recommendations:</H4> 
 
<strong>1. Resources for the Andean region should be shifted away from 
military and police efforts toward sustainable development activities 
and strengthening and reforming local judiciaries where host governments 
have shown clear political will toward those ends.</strong> 
<UL> 
a.) AID should work with municipal governments and non-governmental 
and grassroots organizations to develop income generating pilot 
projects in coca growing regions or areas where migrations to 
those regions is high. These could serve as models to attract 
funding from other governments and international financial institutions. 
<P> 
b.) AID should commission a study by respected experts in international 
law to review antinarcotics-related judicial reforms undertaken 
in the Andean countries to date and their impact on the rule of 
law. The commission should recommend how such reforms can be brought 
into line with international human rights norms and standards. 
<P> 
c.) Funding for sustainable development and Rule of Law programs 
in the Andes should continue to be channeled through AID, and 
not the State Department's narcotics bureau as the Clinton administration 
has proposed in its fiscal year 1996 budget. 
</UL> 
<strong>2. The administration should be held accountable to its pledge 
that &quot;human rights abuses are not continued by any country 
which receives U.S. counternarcotics assistance.&quot; If such 
abuses are reported in the State Department's 1995 human rights 
report, counternarcotics assistance should be suspended immediately.</strong> 
<ul> 
a.) The ban on all military aid to Peru should be maintained. 
The Clinton administration should publicly disclose information 
gathered on drug trafficking related corruption among Peruvian 
police and military units. 
<P> 
b.) No U.S. assistance should be provided to the Colombian army 
until demonstrable progress has been made in curbing human rights 
abuses and prosecuting those responsible.

Burma detains 109 Sun Kyi supporters </H1>
<p>
<p>
BANGKOK, Sept. 27 (UPI) -- Burmese military authorities said Friday they had
detained 109 followers of opposition leader Aung San Sun Kyi to prevent them
from attending a political meeting at her home in Rangoon.<p>
Defense Ministry Maj.  Law Min said those detained were being given "VEP
treatment" at local guest houses.<p>
"Once everything is quiet and normal they will be sent home," Law Min said in a
telephone interview.  "The amount of time they stay there depends on them."<p>
He said the government had no immediate plans to arrest Aung San Sun Kyi, the
daughter of Burmese independence hero Aung San.<p>
Aung San Sun Kyi, who won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for her pro- democracy
activity, was freed last year from nearly six years of house arrest.  The
Burmese military government issued a statement Friday accusing a U.S.Embassy
official in Rangoon, identified only as "Ms.  Myers," of conspiring with Aung
San Sun Kyi to stage an "All Burma Congress of the National League for
Democracy" on Sept. 27-29.<p>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Glyn Davies confirmed that U.S.
diplomats regularly meet with Aung San Sun Kyi and her supporters, but said
charges of a conspiracy to overthrow the Burmese government were "bogus."The
United States "deplores" the detention of democracy activists in Burma and
calls on the military junta running the nation to "immediately and
unconditionally" release them, he said.<p>
The Burmese statement accused Myers of holding a series of private meetings
with Aung San Sun Kyi for political purposes.<p>
"These days are chosen to coincide with the U.N. General Assembly and also the
day when the U.S. Congress enacts the bill on Myanmar (Burma), " the Rangoon
statement said.  "It is learned that the NLD intends to make statements and
demands after reading reports on political, economic, youth and legal affairs.
In order to avoid unnecessary turmoil and instability in the country, the
authorities concerned on the 27th of September prevented this event from taking
place."<p>
The government accused Aung San Sun Kyi's National League for Democracy of
"collaboration with some foreign countries to create unnecessary confusion and
unrest in the country."  Pressure on Burma's democracy movement has been
intensifying in recent weeks and many of Aung San Sun Kyi's closest associates
have been arrested and sentenced to lengthy prison terms.<p>

<H1> Free-Burma fast gets underway world-wide
</H1>
Thailand Times, October 8, 1996<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Bangkok: Chinese human rights activist Harry Wu will today announce the start
of a 48-hour fast to be held in more than 60 universities and high schools across
the United States in protest against the military regime in Burma and
multinational companies that do business with it.<p>

More than 5000 university and high school students and other are set to give
up their daily meals for the next 24 hours in what they believed as a concerted
effort to draw attention to the democracy movement in Burma, said the Free
Burma Coalition, a grass-roots movement based in Madison.<p>

A number of people from FBC's overseas colleagues are also joining the
October 7-9  event with separate activities in Canada, Japan, South Africa, Australia,
India and Thailand.<p>

The organizers said they aim to get world leaders' response as happened in
South Africa where apartheid had led to effective multilateral sanctions in the
1980s.<p>

The fast followed weeks of recent political crackdowns in Rangoon ahead of
opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's planned party congress. Nearly 800
democracy supporters and activists were rounded up in the military's nationwide
swoop as it blocked access to Suu Kyi's house.  In response to the fast, Aung
San Suu Kyi said, "There is a great need for the world to know that the people of Burma are suffering from continuous repression and injustice... <p>

The fast will help to focus attention on the essentially peaceful nature of the
quest for democracy in Burma. <p>

FBC is am Imternet-based grassroots movement founded by exiled Burmese
students.<p>

Burma Bans Modems And Fax Machines</H1>
<p>
<p>
RANGOON, BURMA, 1996 SEP 27 (Newsbytes) -- Burma has made owning,
using,importing or borrowing a modem or fax machine without government
permission a crime, punishable by up to 15 years in jail, according to a report
by United Press International.<p>
<p>
Burma's military government has imposed what's called "The Computer Science
Development Law"    which empowers the Ministry of Communications, Posts and
Telegraphs to specify what exactly can be restricted, UPI reports.<p>
<p>
UPI quotes the government-run newspaper New Light of Myanmar as saying the same
punishment is prescribed for anyone who sets up a link with a computer network
without the prior permission of the ministry, or who uses computer network and
information technology "for undermining state security, law and order, national
unity, national economy and national culture, or who obtains or transmits state
secrets."<p>
<p>
UPI reports that in July a diplomat, Leo Nichols, died in prison after he was
sentenced to a lengthy term for illegal possession of fax machines.<p>

<H1> Diplomatic tit-for-tat skirts crucial issues </H1>
<p>
<p>
Yangon, Stephen Brookes, Asia Times, 8th October 1996<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
With the accusations of internal meddling, the threat of economic sanctions and
a tit-for-tat exchange of visa restrictions, relations between the United
States and Myanmar have become chaotic, analysts in Yangon said on Monday.<p>
<p>
"Relations are seriously strained," admitted a spokesman at the US embassy in
Yangon.<p>
<p>
"It's worse than that," said one observer in Yangon. "The whole thing is
becoming a ridiculous farce."<p>
<p>
The latest chapter in the already-tense relationship between Washington and
Yangon opened last week, when a top official with Myanmar's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) publicly accused US Charge d'Affaires Marilyn Meyers of
"interference in our internal affairs".<p>
<p>
Khin Maung Win, director-general of MOFA, said Meyers had told him on September
24 that the National League for          Democracy (NLD), led by Aung San Suu
Kyi, was about to hold a  convention, and the government should not interfere.
"She also intimated that if any action was taken against the NLD ... it  would
have negative implications," he said, adding that he told her that he regarded
her remarks as "going beyond the normal norms of diplomacy".<p>
<p>
In Washington, the charges were immediately denounced. "Those allegations are
groundless - it's ridiculous to characterize her contacts with Burmese
government officials and others this way," said Glyn Davies, a State Department
spokesman.<p>
<p>
Meyers, who announced her retirement from the post in August, left Yangon on
October 4. She will be replaced by Kent Wiedemann in mid-October, according to
the embassy.<p>
<p>
Some observers in Yangon, while appalled at the breach of diplomatic confidence
by the Myanmar government, said the incident was not surprising. "Marilyn was
just not the right person for this job," said one Myanmar observer with
contacts in MOFA. "She was brusque, and didn't know how to communicate
successfully with the SLORC. She may not have been trying to be offensive, but
they were convinced she was trying to intimidate them."<p>
<p>
Moreover, said another analyst, Meyers had come to be seen by key members of
the government as a proxy for Suu Kyi, and a highly personal and derogatory
campaign against her was undertaken this summer. In one editorial in the
state-controlled press she was referred to in a Myanmar phrase that translated
as "Marilyn Menstrual Blood", and an editorial on Saturday said she "regarded
herself as a democracy prophet".<p>
<p>
Meyer's replacement by Wiedemann might hold out some hope for a "grace period"
of better relations, said observers,but tensions with Washington were rising
over key policy issues, not just personality.<p>
<p>
Washington's support for dialogue with Suu Kyi remains the cornerstone of its
policy toward the SLORC, and in a move that could foreshadow further punitive
actions, the administration of US President Bill Clinton issued a proclamation
on October 3 charging the SLORC (State Law and Order Restoration Council) with
"continuing political repression", and restricting the immigration of "Burmese
nationals who formulate or implement policies that impede Burma's transition to
democracy", as well as their families.<p>
<p>
In Yangon, observers were unimpressed. "It was a shot across the bow, but a
rather silly one," scoffed one resident. "Some general's kid can't go to
Disneyland - is that going to force SLORC to the bargaining table?"<p>
<p>
Predictably, the SLORC responded the next day by issuing visa restrictions on
any US nationals deemed to be "acting in a way detrimental to the interests of
the State", effective immediately. Asked whether this represented a real change
in policy, as the SLORC has often withheld visas to those it considers
dangerous, MOFA's Khin Maung Win admitted that the rules merely codified
existing policy.<p>
<p>
And in Washington a few hours later, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns
continued the exchange by labeling the Myanmar move "really ludicrous", adding
that the visa restrictions are "not going to matter one bit to any of us in
Washington DC who make policy or implement it or talk about it".<p>
<p>
The next step remains to be seen. A bill calling for economic sanctions on
Myanmar if "large-scale repression" takes place has become law, but US
officials admit privately Washington has few economic levers to use on Myanmar.
It already denies the SLORC access to loans from international financial
institutions and does not provide bilateral assistance. The sanctions
legislation also would only ban new investment, not force existing companies to
divest.  <p>
<p>
Washington is also continuing its efforts to coordinate with the European Union
and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, but few believe that ASEAN will
impose sanctions over an issue of internal politics - especially as concern
grows over China's economic influence in Myanmar. <p>
<p>
Moreover, Washington is widely perceived in Asia as being both cynical and
hypocritical in its approach to Myanmar - favoring constructive engagement with
China, despite complaints about human rights abuses on a far greater scale than
in Myanmar, while imposing sanctions against Yangon. "It all comes down to the
bottom line - what will sanctions cost?" noted one businessman in Yangon,
adding: "But if sanctions fail, what do you do then? Send in the Marines? I
don't think Bill Clinton is quite ready to do that."<p>

U.S. Focuses on Burma
With Key Posting<p>

By BARRY WAIN and EDUARDO LACHICA
Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL<p>

The selection of Kent Wiedemann to head the American embassy in
Burma is meant to signal U.S. determination to respond to continued political
repression in the country.<p>

In tapping a career service officer who has occupied top Asia-policy
posts in Washington, President Bill Clinton's administration is underlining
the importance it attaches to the Burma beat. When announcing Mr. Wiedemann's appointment, the State 
Department took the opportunity to express concern about jail sentences recently handed down to the first 
of about two dozen supporters of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's National League
for Democracy.<p>

"We view this as another in a series of oppressive actions by the
regime to prevent Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters from exercising their
rights," said spokesman Glyn Davies.<p>

Mr. Wiedemann, deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the Pacific, will take over
in October as charge d'affaires in Rangoon from Marilyn Meyers, who is leaving at the end of a
two-year term. Washington hasn't named an ambassador to Burma since 1990 to protest the
ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council's failure to recognize the results of a general
election that year that was won overwhelmingly by the National League for Democracy.<p>

Protecting Current U.S. Investments<p>

Senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council in 1993 and 1994, Mr.
Wiedemann then switched to a similar slot at the Pentagon. Since moving to his current position in
May last year, he has been responsible for China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Mongolia, Vietnam,
Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Burma.<p>

In May, Mr. Wiedemann delivered a statement to the Senate Finance Committee that indicated
for the first time the administration's willingness to support firmer action against Burma. Although
Washington was unable to persuade its Asian allies to support sanctions, the U.S. continues to
block international financing for Burma and discourages American trade and investment through a
number of measures.<p>

A new U.S. policy, still being fleshed out, aims at providing some protection to the democracy
movement without hurting American investors already established in the country. Details were
contained in an administration-endorsed amendment to an appropriations bill that was approved
by the Senate late last month.<p>

Keeping the Heat on Slorc<p>

It would authorize the president to ban any further U.S. investment if he finds that Slorc has
"harmed, rearrested for political acts or exiled" Ms. Suu Kyi, or has committed large-scale
repressive or violent acts against other democratic leaders. The amendment also would deny U.S.
visas for junta members, and it calls for the U.S. to work with the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations and other interested countries on a "multinational strategy" to improve human-rights
practices in Burma.<p>

Sources in Washington say Mr. Wiedemann was persuaded to accept the Burma posting by
Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs.<p>

Although deputy assistant secretaries in the State Department are usually in line for
ambassadorships, that rule-of-thumb doesn't necessarily apply to Rangoon, officials say. The
U.S. has senior diplomats below ambassadorial rank at other key posts where it isn't appropriate
to have an ambassador, or where one isn't available, the officials say.<p>

As charge d'affaires -- as opposed to ambassador -- Mr. Wiedemann's appointment doesn't
require confirmation by the U.S. Senate. Nor does it require the explicit agreement of the
Burmese government.<p>

With the U.S. vowing to keep the heat on Slorc, analysts say Mr. Wiedemann is bound to find
the position as challenging as any he has occupied abroad. He has served three times in China
and done stints in Singapore and Israel.<p>

Mr. Wiedemann "clearly has a tough job ahead of him," says Mike Jendrzejczyk, the Washington
director of Human Rights Watch/Asia, noting that Slorc is "digging in its heels" and continuing to
confront Ms. Suu Kyi's democratic forces.<p>

Malaysia Official Assails
Authoritarianism in Region<p>

By JON LIDEN
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL<p>

MANILA, Philippines -- In a speech here Friday, Malaysian Deputy
Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim attacked authoritarianism in the
region and said that democracy "is a basic necessity for responsible and
ethical government."<p>

It isn't the first time Datuk Ibrahim -- who is considered the leading candidate to take over the reins of the 
governing party and as prime minister after Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad eventually steps down -- 
has voiced such views. And observers say that Datuk Ibrahim mostly airs his views overseas, rather than in 
Malaysia. But this time, they said, the message was more strongly worded than previous ones.<p>

Datuk Ibrahim spoke as a guest of honor at a Philippine-sponsored
conference on the centennial of its 1896 revolution. Afterwards, he reiterated
his views at a press conference.<p>

The timing also made the speech noteworthy. Coming amid a continuing purge of political
opponents and pro-democracy groups in Indonesia and as the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations has come under attack for being passive in dealing with human-rights abuses in Burma,
the speech was a strongly worded argument in the normally hushed debate over the region's
future political development.<p>

'Democracy Is Not a Luxury'<p>

"It is essential that power be vested in a democratically constituted authority rather than in the
hands of the individual," Datuk Ibrahim said. "Power personalized is power plundered from the
people. Democracy is not a luxury that Asians cannot afford, as some would want us to believe."<p>

Datuk Ibrahim, 49 years old, is a generation younger than many of the leaders who run the
countries in the region. While the fight for independence from the colonial powers shaped much of
the mind-set of leaders such as President Suharto of Indonesia, former Prime Minister Lee Kuan
Yew in Singapore and Malaysia's Dr. Mahathir, Datuk Ibrahim grew up when the student
movements of the 1960s, the Vietnam War and the radical insurgency groups in other developing
countries dominated the political and ideological agenda. He was detained for nearly two years
between 1974 and 1976 under Malaysia's Internal Security Act for leading student demonstrations.<p>

An aide said Datuk Ibrahim had been very upset about recent events in Indonesia: "Those are his
friends being arrested," the aide said, presumably referring to the fact that many of those detained
are student activists, as he once was.<p>

The Middle Path<p>

"I do not defend the condescending attitude of Asian leaders toward their citizenry," Datuk
Ibrahim said at the press conference.<p>

In his speech, Datuk Ibrahim dismissed the idea that democracy is a Western concept, saying that
Asians can build on their past "civilizational ideals and intellectual legacies" to develop
democracies based on "ethical principles and moral uprightness."<p>

He also said, "The fact that democracy is often abused, leading to chaos and paralysis, does not
mean that dictatorship is the answer."<p>

He warned that imitating the West blindly could lead to a social, economic and political morass,
and that "unbridled individualism" must not dominate over majority interests. "The Asian way is to
reach consensus on national goals within a democratic framework, to take the middle path ... to
exercise tolerance and sensitivity toward others."<p>

The Moral Voice<p>

Asked at the press conference whether his views meant he disagreed with the Asean policy of
constructive engagement with Burma's military regime, he said that he couldn't see any viable
alternative for the seven-member body. "We will have to define the limits of what an international
congregation can do. The moral voice, the concern can be expressed, but you can't assume that a
foreign country shall be given the ability to interfere because then there is no end to it."<p>

Datuk Ibrahim warned of Western and Asian hypocrisy: He said that when Western countries or
their companies disregarded human rights or environmental degradation, there was little or no
reaction to be heard; however, once Asians did the same thing, roars of protest could be heard
from Western media and governments. Likewise, Asian use of religion, tradition and values to
defend excesses is just as wrong and hypocritical, he said.<p>

"There are also Asian values that are aligned to feudal practices, to tolerance of corruption," he
said. "And this must be rejected."<p>

Burmese Opposition Leader, US Ambassador to Japan 
Honored by Democratic Group 
By David Briscoe 
Associated Press Writer<p> 
 
CHICAGO (AP) _ The image and voice of Burmese opposition leader 
Aung San Suu Kyi and an impassioned plea from her British husband for freedom in the Southeast Asian  
country brought standing ovations in a hall thousands of miles from the country she will not leave.<p> 
 
Just as the Democratic Party's nominating convention was getting underway across town Monday, more  
than 700 diplomats, foreign officials and Democratic leaders gathered to honor Nobel Peace Prize winner  
Suu Kyi and former Vice President Walter Mondale with the annual W. Averell Harriman Democracy  
Awards.<p> 
 
``At this moment, we in the movement for democracy are facing a lot of difficulties,'' Suu Kyi said in a  
videotape made for the awards ceremony. ``The State Law and Order Restoration council of Burma, the  
military regime which promised to lead Burma to multiparty democracy, is doing everything it can to crush  
the movement for democracy.''<p> 
 
Suu Kyi, whose husband, Michael Aris, accepted the crystal globe award for her, was released from six  
years of house arrest last year and has been speaking to rallies of supporters each weekend outside her  
home.<p> 
 
Aris said his wife ``stands at the sharpest end of this ruthless campaign to destroy the struggle for freedom  
in Burma.'' He said he has not been allowed to visit her since last December. Suu Kyi refuses to leave  
Burma for fear she would not be allowed to return. Aris said the regime has been trying to pressure his wife  
into submission by arresting friends and members of her National League for Democracy. During the  
weekend in Rangoon, Suu Kyi denounced a new wave of arrests, and a senior military leader pledged to  
crush her movement.<p> 
 
``SHE WILL NEVER GIVE INTO THIS MOST EVIL FORM OF BLACKMAIL,'' Aris said, appealing  
for an early end to repression in Burma.<p> 
 
Mondale, in a brief speech accepting the award, praised Suu Kyi and rejected the idea perpetrated by anti- 
democratic forces in Asia that the region is not suited for democracy because of cultural differences with  
Western countries. Mondale, currently U.S. ambassador to Japan, said Suu Kyi ``symbolizes courage for  
human rights and democracy.'' Mondale told reporters he was not attending the Democratic convention and  
that it is the first he'll miss since 1960. He served as vice president to President Carter, who also has said he  
will not attend the convention, although he said he fully supports President Clinton's re-election. 
The Harriman award is named for the former multi-millionaire U.S. diplomat and New York governor, are  
given annually by the National Democratic Institute, an arm of the Democratic Party.<p>

Kavi Chongkittavorn <p> 
 
ALTHOUGH there is no imminent threat to Thailand's security in 
the 21st century border problems, especially on the Burmese side, 
could turn into hot spots in the future a seminar was told yesterday.<p> 
 
"In the next five to 10 years, Thailand's security problem will 
shift from its eastern flank to its western one," said Surachat 
Bamrungsuk of Chulalongkorn University, referring to the end of 
the Cambodian conflict and the ongoing disputes along the  
Thai-Burma border.<p> 
 
Surachat said that as the Burmese forces are consolidating their 
hold in minority controlled areas along the border, which 
stretches more than 2,400 kilometres chances of armed 
confrontations between the two countries will increase. "Given 
the ambiguity of the problem of demarcation along Thai-Burmese 
border, confrontation could occur at any time," he noted.<p> 
 
Outlining the changes in the post Cold War environment pertaining 
to the region and the world, the scholar pointed out that 
Thailand is encountering new non-security issues that could have 
far-reaching ramifications toward the country's security and the 
well-being of its people.<p> 
 
These issues include environmental changes, population 
displacement, problems to do with economic development, disease 
epidemics, income disparity, the information revolution, and 
cultural and ethnic relations which could affect the country's 
security. He said there is an urgent need for Thai strategists 
and policy makers to map out new security directions towards the 
21th century.<p> 
 
Surachat, who has written extensively on Thailand's security 
policies, warned that because of the fast changing world due to 
the information age, Thailand can no long rely on Yuck" as in the 
past.<p> 
 
"If government officials and the public fail to prepare 
themselves and create an environment conducive to sustaining this 
luck, the country will face security problems in the future," he 
said in his paper entitled "Cold War to Cold Peace: Continuity 
and Change of Thailand Security Problems into the 2000s", during 
a two-day conference organised by the Thailand Research Fund.<p> 
 
In the foreseeable future, there are no imminent threats to 
Thailand's security  as the Cold War has ended. Some issues, such 
as the arms build-up in the region and China's southward 
expansion could, however, affect Thailand's security perceptions.<p> 
 
He said that some military leaders feel that the arms procurement 
programs currently under way in neighbouring countries will have 
a direct impact on the Thai security. "And also vice versa, the 
new weapons systems that Thailand's armed forces have deployed 
are also a cause for concern among neighbouring  countries," he said. <p> 
      
Although new weaponry will strengthen the country's armed forces, 
it could also reduce the overall national security as neighbouring countries  
are also engaging in defence spending and arms build-ups, he said.<p> 
      
Given this backdrop, he said, one of the challenges the Thai 
armed forces faces is how to deal effectively with so-called 
"defence management". The high price tag of procuring new arms 
could undermine the country's economic situation, as well as the 
government's stability.<p> 
 
"It is this area that the government still neglects, even though 
it has a direct implication toward its capability to manage the 
country's future security and defence."<p>

<P> 
In the last 20 years, few studies conducted inside schools have 
explored how drug education programs are developed and delivered. 
Many did not take into account how the recipients of such services--students--were 
affected by such programs. This was realized in the following 
report, an evaluation of one of largest drug education efforts 
in the United States, the California Drug, Alcohol, and Tobacco 
Education (DATE) Program. 
<P> 
With extensive appreciation for the previous research literature, 
we began our research with several assumptions: 
<OL> 
<LI>It is not just what is taught to students in drug education 
programs, (i.e. content) that affects students' decisions about 
substance use. 
<LI>Social and political processes inside school districts have 
a significant impact on the types and levels of drug education 
programs that are implemented. 
<LI>Social and political processes inside school districts regarding 
drug education have a significant impact on students. 
</OL> 
 
<P> 
These assumptions provided the rationale for our research across 
the state of California. This study exemplifies a balance between 
representation and depth. Researchers performed in-depth interviews 
at over 50 school districts with school district personnel in 
all positions involved with developing and delivering drug educational 
services. Based on early results, we developed survey items that 
were administered to more than 5000 students in grades 7 through 
12. At the same time, 40 groups of students perceived to be at 
risk for substance abuse and thriving in their schools were interviewed. 
This report consists of material from school district personnel/student 
interviews and student survey data. It contains perceptions about 
the context of drug education programs, the content and processes 
of drug education, and how students respond to them. 
<P> 
The findings in this study have not been static; in keeping with 
qualitative research methods, as new evidence has arisen, the 
design, analyses and results have evolved. In fact, the results 
in this study are still evolving; new findings may emerge for 
years to come. 
<P> 
Through an extensive search of the literature, we believe this 
study is distinctive. The student's voices ask us to reexamine 
fundamental assumptions about how they are seen, and how, through 
drug education, their social welfare and public health needs are 
met (or not met). By comparing their everyday lives with the drug 
education they receive in schools, students raise serious questions 
about the relationships between politics, policy, social welfare, 
and public health. This research shows that other solutions previously 
proposed (e.g., more drug education booster sessions) will probably 
not resolve the educational and personal dilemmas students describe. 
Most importantly, possibly for the first time, the students themselves 
provide us with a key for success; what they would like to see 
in their own drug education. Through students' eyes, this research 
contributes information permitting California to take the lead 
in providing for their social welfare and public health needs. 
Their voices and these issues are presented in the following report. 
 
<P> 
We wish to thank the State of California for providing the support 
for this important research.

The widespread perception of the problem of adolescent substance 
abuse has significantly influenced social policy decisions. In 
an effort to prevent substance use and abuse by children and adolescents, 
the California Drug, Alcohol, and Tobacco Education (DATE) Program 
was initiated in 1991, with federal, state, and local dollars. 
During that year, a large-scale outcome evaluation was undertaken. 
Although there have been many evaluations of school-based drug 
prevention programs like DATE, few explained the processes through 
which drug prevention programs were designed or implemented. This 
report represents a unique attempt at evaluating such programs 
from the perspective of school district personnel and students. 
Perhaps for the first time, researchers were able to generate 
an explanation of the &quot;whats&quot; and &quot;hows&quot; of 
drug prevention programs in 50 school districts with 388 school-district 
personnel composed of superintendents, assistant superintendents, 
financial coordinators, DATE coordinators, curriculum directors, 
principals, vice principals, teachers, counselors, specialists, 
and community members. Also, for first time, researchers interviewed 
nearly 250 students in 40 focus groups considered to be &quot;at-risk 
for substance abuse&quot; and &quot;thriving&quot; in their school. 
Students in grades 5 through 12 described how they were affected 
by drug issues and their DATE education. This student data is 
combined with survey data from more than 5,000 randomly selected 
students in grades 7 through 12. An evaluation focus from these 
perspectives is far different than typically discussed by many 
drug prevention experts. Although funding for the DATE Program 
has been phased out, the material yielded in this evaluation provides 
extensive information about the development of drug education 
programs, and the processes through which school district personnel 
develop and implement programs. We hope this vast database will 
be used to examine these issues for years to come. 
<P> 
With the student's voice as the centerpiece of this presentation, 
the data strongly suggests that many student substance use decisions 
are either neutrally and/or negatively influenced by their school-based 
drug education. Students' discussion of information and the processes 
through which such information is delivered helps us understand 
adolescent substance use decisions. Researchers identified a mismatch 
between how educational services were developed/implemented compared 
with how students perceive such issues, and want these services 
to be delivered. 
<P> 
When considering DATE service implementation, more than 90 percent 
of student focus groups described participating in the following 
DATE services and/or activities: Drug Abuse Resistance Education 
[DARE] (52.5 percent), Health/Science courses (42.5 percent), 
Anti-drug assemblies (30 percent), Red Ribbon weeks (27.5 percent) 
and counseling (22.5 percent). Most of the DARE and anti-drug 
assemblies occurred at the elementary school level. Most of the 
Red Ribbon weeks, health and science courses, and counseling (either 
peer or professional) were described in middle and high schools. 
 
<P> 
A majority of service deliverers described their attempt to influence 
students not to use substances through graphic portrayals or presentations 
of the harmful consequences of substance use. 
<P> 
For example: 
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
<EM>They've done an activity, I'm not sure what this is really 
called, but, where they paint the faces white of the student and 
that student is dead and they do so many students every few seconds 
depicting that is how many people die in traffic accidents on 
a major holiday weekend. Then the student returns to class and 
is not allowed to speak the rest of the day. (Laughter) It makes 
an impact---</EM> 
</BLOCKQUOTE> 
 
<H3>School District Personnel </H3> 
 
<P> 
What impact do such programs have on student substance use decisions? 
In a randomly-selected student survey of 5,045 students in grades 
7 through 12, it was found that at least 40 percent of California's 
students are &quot;not at all&quot; influenced by DATE services, 
or service deliverers. A majority of those surveyed have a neutral 
(39.4 percent) to negative (30 percent) affect toward such service 
deliverers, feeling that their substance use decisions were either 
&quot;a lot&quot; or &quot;completely&quot; due to themselves 
(58.5 percent). While some students may appear to be influenced 
by DATE services, the most germane patterns of these results suggest 
that many are not. Qualitatively, survey results supported quantitative 
results. As grade level increased, so too did student dissatisfaction 
regarding drug education. Students described the difference between 
their school-based drug education and personal knowledge. For 
many, such differences became a source of dissonance, as the following 
excerpt from this elementary school interview shows: 
<P> 
<EM>R: [second] He doesn't want to tell you everything about it.</EM> 
<P> 
R: [lead] Everything like details. 
<P> 
I: Why not? 
<P> 
R: [lead] I guess that's just the way he is. I don't know. 
<P> 
I: How do you guys feel about that? 
<P> 
R: [lead] Depressed. Because if he's about talking to us about 
drugs and alcohol and all these kind of things he should come 
out with those, you know, he should talk to us right---you know, 
with the whole thing, not just say a little bit and then just 
leave the rest behind--- 
<H3>Elementary School Students </H3> 
 
<P> 
Dissonance at the elementary level leads to an apparent disregard 
of school-based drug education in older students. Beginning with 
10 percent of elementary school focus groups, elevating to 33 
percent of middle school groups, and concluding with more than 
90 percent of high school interviews, many students described 
wanting comprehensive drug information delivered through a different 
process: 
<P> 
<EM>R: I think the problem with education is---this kind of education 
is that you're constantly being shoved down your throat it's so 
wrong, if you do it you're a terrible, evil person, instead of 
just educating saying I know some of you people do it, why do 
you do it, let's try to help you so you don't do it any more. 
If it is shoved into you that you're a terrible person when you 
do this, you know, you kind of want to back away from the education 
process because they've already made a judgement upon you, you're 
a terrible person if you smoke marijuana, if you do alcohol, if 
you smoke cigarettes, you're a terrible person, instead of approaching 
it as, OK, you guys do it, let's help you now.</EM> 
<P> 
I: So then the goal should be to get people into not doing it. 
<P> 
R: No I'm not saying that, I'm saying the goal should be to evaluate 
yourself and figure out why you do it, evaluate your own personal 
habits and your personal values and morals. 
<P> 
R: I don't think it is realistic to assume that anyone is not 
going to try some things in their life, I mean, it's ridiculous 
that presidents---I think that is a part of growing up--- 
<H3>High School Students </H3> 
 
<P> 
Overall, 54 percent of student focus groups wanted more panels 
and talks by outside drug educators who could provide confidential 
educational services. 
<P> 
One goal of the DATE program was to identify and provide services 
for those students considered to be at greatest risk for substance 
use and/or abuse. Indeed, most school district personnel viewed 
most students as being at-risk for this condition: 
<P> 
<EM>R: We are addressing the risk factors that show up, with the 
idea that it's real hard for me to point out which of our kids 
are not at risk---</EM> 
<H3>School District Personnel </H3> 
 
<P> 
The &quot;risk-orientation,&quot; was the dominant construct described 
by school district personnel as a rationale for developing and 
implementing DATE services. Consequently, in the DATE Program, 
at-risk youth have been specially targeted for primary services. 
When comparing the services that &quot;thriving&quot; students 
received with those received by &quot;at-risk&quot; students, 
researchers found that while &quot;at-risk&quot; students were 
identified, they reported receiving virtually the same services 
as their &quot;thriving&quot; counterparts. As applied, the risk 
factor model is of questionable value. 
<P> 
Another goal of the DATE program was insuring that clear drug 
policies were present in all school districts. Descriptions of 
drug policies were given in 97.5 percent of student focus groups. 
Almost all student discussion of policies specified negative sanctions 
for use. When asked or volunteering what happens to a student 
who is caught using a substance and/or alcohol, more than 90 percent 
reported one or more of the following three elements: detention, 
suspension, expulsion. Students wondered why DATE services did 
not help those who have a problem with substance use: 
<P> 
<EM>R...They are not in this for helping you, they are in [it] 
for getting rid of the bad kids and just having all good kids 
in school. [spoken very emphatically]...</EM> 
<P> 
R: Well, maybe if you could get them to care more then they would 
do that [a different respondent than the others above]. 
<P> 
R: If they suspect you of smoking or having drugs on you or whatever, 
if they see a kid like that in their school then, instead of suspending 
them and getting them out of school, why don't they help then?--- 
<H3>High School Students </H3> 
 
<P> 
Paradoxically, although significant DATE funding was gained through 
the identification of at-risk students, most students and some 
district personnel described at-risk students as often being excluded 
from the school system when needing help: 
<P> 
<CITE>R: We still get rid of too many kids...those are the kids 
that the state of California and the United States of America 
have identified as their target population...the kids that are 
at risk the most, are the kids that are exited from the system, 
and they do not have access to the resources...The kids that we 
need to keep in and provide resources to are the kids that we 
exit from the system---</CITE> 
<H3>School District Personnel </H3> 
 
<P> 
The application of the risk factor model was seen as failing for 
two reasons. First, in California schools, the risk factor model 
is misused as an individual diagnostic tool. Prevention science 
risk factors may be related to populations of students (Coie et 
al., 1993; Hawkins et al., 1992), but there is little evidence 
that they predict substance &quot;abuse&quot; in individual students 
(Brown and Horowitz, 1993; Fine, 1993). Moreover, protective factor 
research shows that most &quot;at risk&quot; adolescents do not 
go on to become substance &quot;abusers&quot; (Werner, 1986). 
Second, <STRONG>the model is inherently difficult to implement.</STRONG> 
This evidence suggests that while the practice of identifying 
such students occurred, it seemed to be beyond the resources of 
many schools to provide individualized services. If assistance 
for those designated as &quot;at&quot; or &quot;high&quot; risk 
is not forthcoming, then the process of identification in and 
of itself, has a negative repercussion (Rossi, 1994) best summarized 
by Baizerman and Compton (1992), who said: 
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
The major use of this ideology is to construct a socioeducational 
population of at-risk students and suggest that they are both 
the problem and its cause. The school is absolved and can be expected 
only to &quot;do its best with limited resources (p.9).&quot; 
 
</BLOCKQUOTE> 
 
<P> 
Both students and school district personnel have identified the 
primary effects of the DATE program. While some of the students 
felt that DATE services have helped them, most believed that DATE 
services: 
<OL> 
<LI>Result in developmentally inappropriate programs, which in 
turn, result in increasing sources of unnecessary dissonance for 
many students. 
<LI>Undermine the school personnel's credibility by giving students 
only one perspective, which students perceive as biased. 
<LI>Help create policies that exclude those whom students themselves 
recognize as most in need of help; they drive those, who already 
might be on the margins of the school system further out. 
</OL> 
 
<P> 
In making the following recommendations, this research stands 
together with a growing body of other research. The evidence from 
this study suggests that school-based drug education should: 
<OL> 
<LI><STRONG>Provide a developmentally appropriate set of prevention 
programs at all grade levels.</STRONG> 
<LI>Discontinue primarily harmful consequences educational services. 
<LI>Shift to a harm reduction approach similar to that used when 
delivering AIDS education without condoning substance use 
<LI>Recruit outside drug educators to provide confidential educational 
services. 
<LI>Either fully assist &quot;at&quot; and &quot;high&quot; risk 
youth, or discontinue use of the model. 
<LI>Not purge students in need of help from the educational system. 
 
<LI>Bolster counseling services. 
</OL> 
 
<P> 
Given current results, research literature, and historical context, 
the changes requested by students must be construed as the only 
remaining, legitimate way to improve school-based drug education. 
In the course of understanding the educational development and 
implementation practices of school district personnel, students 
exposed three myths that need to be dispelled: 
<OL> 
<LI><STRONG>Adolescents are naive: On the contrary, they are sophisticated 
individuals capable of making sophisticated decisions</STRONG> 
(Jessor and Jessor, 1977; Newcomb and Bentler, 1988; McIntyre 
et al., 1989; Moore and Saunders, 1991; Quandrel et al.,1993). 
<LI><STRONG>Any adolescent substance use is deviant: Putting legalities 
and politics aside, because they may experiment with substances, 
adolescents are not inherently deviant</STRONG><B> </B>(Jessor 
and Jessor, 1977; Newcomb and Bentler, 1988; Shedler and Block, 
1990). 
<LI><STRONG>Most adolescents go on to become substance &quot;abusers:&quot; 
In fact, up to 70 percent of students in the highest risk conditions 
do not go on to become substance abusers</STRONG><B> </B>(Werner, 
1986; Brown and Horowitz, 1993). Additionally, like many adults, 
there are many &quot;thriving&quot; adolescents who drink and 
may use substances, and are contributing members to their school 
communities. 
</OL> 
 
<P> 
We are not condoning adolescent substance use; nevertheless, adolescent 
substance using behaviors exist. In conclusion, the alternative--judging 
student behaviors based on these myths-- has been tried, and schools 
have paid a high price. This research necessitates a well-founded 
shift in both the fundamental assumptions and the processes found 
in California's school-based drug education.

In 1990, California SB899 (chapter 467) called for an overall 
evaluation of the California Drug, Alcohol, and Tobacco Education 
(DATE) Program. From 1991 to 1994, this evaluation was conducted 
along three quantitative dimensions: cost, program implementation, 
and self-reported student substance use knowledge, attitudes, 
beliefs, and behaviors (Romero, et al., 1993; 1994). Evaluators 
made site visits and collected data from 120 randomly selected 
districts, 10 percent of all California school districts. Data 
were collected describing the selected districts' expenditures 
for each DATE service. Additionally, researchers conducted approximately 
12,000 surveys of students in grades 4 through 12. Evaluation 
participation was mandated by the California State Department 
of Education. The main goal was to ascertain whether the DATE 
Program had resulted in a reduction in student substance use (alcohol, 
tobacco, and illicit substances). While these data are yielding 
important information, it does not explain how expenditure decisions 
were made, or how social processes of program development and 
implementation occurred. Even though many students were surveyed, 
the original design did not provide an understanding of student 
decision-making related to survey results. To achieve this, a 
large-scale, qualitative evaluation component was undertaken in 
1992 and 1993. 
<P> 
This evaluation is one of the largest qualitative studies of how 
people develop and deliver drug prevention and intervention services 
ever performed in the State of California. The results presented 
here arise from 2 years of qualitative data collection and analysis 
and targeted student survey questions. The findings described 
in this report arise from analysis of almost 200 interviews in 
more than 50 school districts. Participants included those developing, 
delivering (school district personnel), and receiving (students) 
DATE services as well as, 5,045 randomly selected student surveys 
administered in grades 7 through 12. Researchers present detailed 
information of what does and does not work according to DATE implementors 
and students. These findings include evidence of effectiveness 
of services related to in-school high-risk youth. Researchers 
attempted to answer the following questions: 
<UL> 
<LI><STRONG>What is the philosophical context of the DATE Program?</STRONG> 
<LI><STRONG>What educational and policy services are being delivered 
under the DATE Program?</STRONG> 
<LI><STRONG>Are &quot;at-risk&quot; students receiving specialized 
services?</STRONG> 
<LI><STRONG>What instructional strategies are used to prevent 
students from using substances?</STRONG> 
</UL> 
 
<UL> 
<LI><STRONG>How do students respond to DATE services?</STRONG> 
 
</UL> 
 
<UL> 
<LI><STRONG>To what extent are students influenced by DATE services 
and policies?</STRONG> 
<LI><STRONG>What works according to students?</STRONG> 
</UL> 
 
<P> 
Research methods for each study year are described. This is followed 
by results, leading into our discussion and implications. 
<HR> 
 
<H2><A NAME="methods">II. Methods overview </A></H2> 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="#toc"><I>(Table of Contents)</I></A> 
<P> 
The findings presented here arise from a naturalistic (field) 
evaluation inquiry conducted in 1992 and 1993 (Filstead, 1970; 
Parlett and Hamilton, 1972; Stake, 1975; Guba, 1978; Quinn-Patton, 
1987; Guba and Lincoln, 1981). In 1992, the research goal was 
to establish school district personnel's perceptions of DATE Program 
development and implementation. In 1993, the research goal was 
to examine student perceptions of service implementation and effectiveness. 
Additionally, the extent to which these programs had similar and/or 
different effects on perceived &quot;at-risk&quot; versus &quot;thriving&quot; 
students was examined. It should be noted that since the goals 
were different for each study year, when school district personnel 
results are reported, they will not include frequency of occurrence. 
When student findings are reported, they will include frequency 
of occurrence. 
<P> 
In this study three evaluation terms were defined: 
<OL> 
<LI>DATE Programs: &quot;...funding and regulatory umbrellas for 
diverse local projects that provide service...&quot;(Shadish, 
et al., 1991 p. 39). 
<LI>Program services: Drug educational activities constructed 
and provided on a continuing basis (Sanders et.al, 1994, p.3). 
 
<LI>Development and implementation: Verbal descriptions of how 
DATE personnel participated in decision-making, which DATE services 
were developed and by whom, and how the services functioned. 
</OL> 
 
<P> 
Based on these goals and evaluation terms, researchers collected 
and analyzed data using the following research methods. 
<H3>1992 District Sample </H3> 
 
<P> 
In 1992, of 120 districts where quantitative data was collected, 
42 were randomly selected and visited by a qualitative team. The 
eight largest districts in California were also selected and visited. 
Reflecting the state population, 31 were districts were from Southern 
and Central California, 13 were from the Bay Area, and 6 were 
from extreme Northern California. Including the 8 largest districts 
that were automatically selected, the sampling plan ensured that 
every California school district had an equal chance of selection. 
As a consequence, all geographic regions were proportionally represented 
in this sample. This plan maximized the generalizabilty of the 
results to the State of California. 
<H3>1992 Respondent Sample </H3> 
 
<P> 
During 1992, a total of 388 respondents were interviewed. Of these 
184 came from the district level, and 204 came from the school 
level. At each district and at each of two randomly selected schools 
within the selected districts, between seven and nine key informants, 
(that is, those involved with developing and implementing the 
DATE Program) were purposely selected for an interview (Zelditch, 
1962; Schutz, Walsh, and Lehnert, 1967; Glick, 1970; Spradley, 
1979; Gordon, 1981). Interviewees ranged across organizational 
levels from teachers to the superintendent. They included: (a) 
the district DATE coordinator, (b) one DATE coordinator supervisor, 
(c) one DATE coordinator staff member, (d) the district financial 
coordinator, (e) the superintendent or assistant superintendent, 
(f) the site coordinator and a teacher at each of two schools 
visited, and (g) a community member involved with the DATE project. 
Additionally, in this first round of qualitative data collection, 
four sets of exploratory interviews were conducted. One was with 
a pupil personnel services director, and three took place with 
students. Two of three student interviews were with groups of 
high school students (5&#173;8 students), and one interview was 
with a high school student participating as a DATE representative 
on a school board. 
<P> 
In 1992, researchers selected a subsample from the larger data 
set for analysis. This subsample consisted of 149 interviews from 
the original interviews, and included the following: 
<UL> 
<LI>72 school&#173;district personnel 
<LI>71 school&#173;site personnel 
<LI>participants of 2 high school student focus groups 
<LI>1 individual high school student 
<LI>3 California State Department of Education officials 
</UL> 
 
<P> 
This data subset was procured through a combined deliberate and 
randomly-selected data sampling procedure. The purposeful sample 
consisted of the two most informative interviews from each of 
25 randomly-selected districts, as determined by the interviewers. 
&quot;Most informative&quot; was defined as those interviews providing 
a high yield of information regarding the incidence and distribution 
of the phenomena of DATE Program implementation and effectiveness 
(Marshall and Rossman, 1989). Two interviews from the remaining 
25 districts were randomly drawn, transcribed, and analyzed. Finally, 
from the examination of the previous interview data, three complete 
&quot;most informative&quot; sets of school district data were 
purposely selected and transcribed for analysis. 
<H3>1993 District Sample </H3> 
 
<P> 
In 1993, 12 districts from the original 50 were purposely selected 
to be resampled, based on 1992 findings regarding the potential 
effects of a school district organizational structure on the DATE 
Program (not part of this presentation). One district refused 
to participate despite the state's mandate, producing 11 sampled 
districts. A balance was sought among districts with respect to 
socioeconomic status (SES), demographics, and average daily student 
attendance. Of these, seven were from Southern and Central California, 
two were from the Bay Area, and two were from extreme Northern 
California. As in 1992, qualitative schools within each district 
were selected based on the larger random selection of quantitative 
districts. Thus, schools randomly selected from 1992 were not 
necessarily selected in 1993. In addition, one of the State's 
eight largest districts was purposely selected. In this district 
only, three schools (instead of two) were randomly selected. From 
the 11 districts, 23 schools were sampled. Unlike the 1992 primarily 
random sampling plan, the 1993 sampling plan was purposeful. In 
a smaller, more refined way than the previous year, this sampling 
plan secured districts containing important aspects of DATE Program 
implementation and effectiveness. This plan ensured that researchers 
were able to examine assertions generated from the larger 1992 
data set. 
<H3>1993 Respondent Sample </H3> 
 
<P> 
At each school, two focus groups of students were selected by 
the principal: one group composed of six students perceived as 
&quot;thriving,&quot; and one group composed of six students perceived 
to be &quot;at-risk for becoming substance abusers.&quot; Researchers 
requested that each group be composed of all grades (at and above 
grade 4) in each school and half males/half females. In terms 
of selection criteria, the principal's perceptions of &quot;at-risk&quot; 
students were consistent with both 1992 and 1993 results. For 
example, consistent inclusion criteria for the perceived &quot;at-risk&quot; 
students were the risk factors of low academic achievement and 
low commitment to school. Criterion for inclusion in the perceived 
&quot;thriving&quot; group was characterized by leadership in 
school activities. 
<P> 
Because of strict anonymity limitations placed on data collection 
procedures with students, the California State Department of Education 
did not allow researchers to record gender and ethnicity characteristics 
of students in focus groups. Nevertheless, in 1993, several district, 
school, and respondent sampling measures were taken to achieve 
a gender and minority balance of student focus groups, proportional 
to that of the State of California. First, at the district level, 
when selecting school districts, researchers sought a balance 
of gender, ethnicity, and average daily attendance. School districts 
containing the organizational characteristics desired for study 
were identified by the research team. Once identified, researchers 
used the California Basic Educational Data System (CBEDS) to select 
districts that approximated the average daily attendance, gender, 
and ethnicity balance of the State. This process ensured a gender 
and ethnicity balance representative of California school districts. 
Second, after the districts were selected, two schools in each 
district were randomly selected, based on a proportional stratified 
sample of student enrollment in California schools. This ensured 
a gender and ethnicity balance representative of California schools. 
Third, at the student level, the sample was purposely selected 
to seek out those children and adolescents who were perceived 
as &quot;at risk for substance abuse;&quot; to be compared with 
those who were perceived not to be &quot;at-risk for substance 
abuse,&quot; &quot;thriving&quot; children and adolescents. It 
was believed that principals, key informants who were in constant 
contact with students, and the circumstances/characteristics placing 
them at risk for substance abuse (e.g., familial dysfunction) 
were most able to purposely select a gender and ethnic balance 
of those students. Researchers explicitly asked them to provide 
such a gender and ethnicity balance. Additionally, on-the-spot 
interviewers informally noted the gender and minority representation. 
Through review of comment sheets and discussion with interviewers 
researchers found a gender and minority representation approximating 
that of California. Through these processes, no one has been excluded 
from this study because of gender or ethnicity. 
<P> 
The 1993 sampling process yielded 40 student interviews (20 elementary 
school interviews, 9 middle school interviews, and 11 high school 
interviews), representing approximately 250 students. The unit 
of analysis was the focus group, and all qualitative evidence 
was considered valuable. Consequently, data from these interviews 
were included and analyzed when there were more or fewer students 
than the proscribed six. This process generated 18 complete pairs 
(perceived &quot;thriving&quot; versus perceived &quot;at-risk&quot;) 
of in-depth student interviews, 3 &quot;mixed&quot; (perceived 
&quot;at-risk&quot; and &quot;thriving&quot;) group interviews, 
1 unpaired &quot;thriving&quot; interview, and one blank interview 
(due to a tape recorder malfunction). The &quot;mixed&quot; interviews 
arose from the largest school district. These three &quot;mixed&quot; 
interviews offered a means of comparing this data with the risk 
versus thriving groups. 
<P> 
In summary, 1992 data collections produced 388 key informant interviews, 
149 of which were transcribed and analyzed. Relative to the DATE 
policy language, from the school district personnel perspective, 
first-year collection and analysis helped researchers to establish 
two important aspects of DATE: first, the programs they develop 
and deliver for California's students, and second, how they perceive, 
identify, and assist students who are at risk for substance use 
and abuse, a significant goal of the DATE Program. In 1993, 40 
student interviews, involving more than 200 students, were collected, 
transcribed, and analyzed. During that year, researchers evaluated 
DATE Programs from the student point of view. 
<H3>1992 Interview questions </H3> 
 
<P> 
Interview questions focused on processes of developing and implementing 
the DATE Program. The questions asked of school district personnel 
defining DATE Programs, services, development, and implementation 
appear in Appendix 1. Questions were broad enough to allow for 
new and important information to emerge, yet specific enough to 
reflect directly on the DATE Program. Follow&#173;up questions 
were used when the interviewer felt it might enhance understanding 
of the development and implementation processes. 
<H3>1993 Interview questions </H3> 
 
<P> 
Following the same procedures as in 1992, two student interview 
schedules were devised, one for grades 5-6 and one for grades 
7-12. The texts of each are found in Appendix 2. Researchers defined 
implementation and evaluation terms as follows: 
<H4>Implementation </H4> 
 
<OL> 
<LI>Overall extent to which students in both (&quot;at-risk&quot; 
and &quot;thriving&quot;) focus groups describe awareness of drug 
policies (as defined by descriptions of governing principles about 
school drug enforcement and/or assistance). 
<LI>Overall extent to which students described particular DATE 
services as delivered by specialists. Specialists are individuals 
who have special knowledge, status, or communication skills directed 
toward substance abuse prevention (Gilchrist, 1992). 
<LI>Overall extent to which students described particular DATE 
services. DATE services are defined as descriptions of alcohol, 
tobacco, or other drug education activities constructed and provided 
on a continuing basis (Sanders et al., 1994, p.3). 
</OL> 
 
<H4>Effectiveness </H4> 
 
<OL> 
<LI>Comparative extent (&quot;at-risk&quot; versus &quot;thriving&quot; 
groups) to which students described DATE services as previously 
defined. Effectiveness was defined as the extent to which &quot;at-risk&quot; 
students would report different and more individualized DATE services 
than their &quot;thriving&quot; counterparts. 
<LI>Overall and comparative extent to which students distinguish 
between substance use and abuse. If program deliverers provide 
a &quot;no use&quot; message, and students make strong distinctions 
between substance use and abuse, then effectiveness of services 
depends on how students discuss the relationship between what 
they services they receive, and where their personal understanding 
arose from. 
<LI>Overall and comparative extent to which students feel that 
policies are beneficial to them. &quot;Beneficial&quot; is defined 
as helping themselves or their friends if and when they perceive 
they have a substance use problem. 
</OL> 
 
<P> 
These terms defined how researchers would evaluate the DATE Program 
in 1993. 
<H3>1992 Data collection </H3> 
 
<P> 
Eleven people conducted interviews. Each interviewer had previous 
experience with site-based interviewing and was specially trained 
for the DATE study. In addition to being trained to use the interview 
schedule, interviewers were advised to respect the integrity of 
key informants. No information was so important as to justify 
interaction that might prove threatening to the individual. Interviewers 
were instructed to end the interview if: (a) the confidentiality 
of the informant was threatened, or (b) the interviewee was emotionally 
involved in the interview to the point where the integrity of 
the data was threatened. This did not occur. 
<P> 
Following each interview, a comment sheet containing the interviewer's 
immediate impressions of the interview was completed and included 
in the data corpus for analysis. Also, upon completion of all 
interviews, each interviewer wrote a two&#173; to three-page summary 
statement of his or her most interesting observations. In each 
district all qualitative data was collected during two days. 
<H3>1992 Data Analysis </H3> 
 
<P> 
The research team consisted of two members who performed almost 
half of all the field interviews and four other team members who 
performed data analysis only. The team included two quantitative 
educational evaluators, one former superintendent and educational/organizational 
researcher, one substance use and organizational/educational researcher, 
one public health substance use specialist, and two substance 
use/abuse researchers who performed transcription and were trained 
for analysis. Each member was selected based on his or her varied 
background and expertise, providing a range of informed perspectives, 
thereby facilitating interpretation. 
<P> 
Analysis was conducted at the district, school, and student levels 
using the constant comparative method found in the grounded theoretical 
approach (Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Strauss and Corbin, 1990). 
In this method, researchers constantly compare interviewee statements 
within and between interviews to determine similar and/or dissimilar 
statements of beliefs and behaviors of those involved in the development 
and implementation of the DATE Program. Through rigorous categorizations 
of such statements, researchers gain an in-depth understanding 
of what DATE services are being implemented, why they are being 
implemented, and how they are being implemented. This method is 
designed to allow assertions to emerge and evolve as data are 
compared, ultimately resulting in a set of findings grounded in 
data. 
<P> 
The constant comparative method found in the grounded theoretical 
approach may be contrasted with basic quantitative approaches, 
such as the student survey data, in which basic hypotheses are 
formed ahead of time (a priori) and questions are asked reflecting 
those hypotheses. Using the constant comparative method, hypotheses 
about the meaning of the data may be &quot;generated&quot; from 
the data itself; these hypotheses are then &quot;tested&quot; 
in the field, and during analysis. For example, in 1992 school 
district personnel described a philosophical context of DATE that 
researchers called the &quot;risk orientation;&quot; it was seen 
as a method of identifying and possibly serving students, such 
that without help, these students may become substance &quot;abusers.&quot; 
Based on this early evidence, researchers then postulated that 
if the risk orientation was effective, individualized DATE services 
would be more prevalent for &quot;at-risk&quot; students than 
for &quot;thriving&quot; students. To evaluate this, rather than 
going back to all of the same individuals researchers interviewed 
the previous year, researchers performed a second round of data 
collection comparing &quot;at-risk&quot; students with &quot;thriving&quot; 
students regarding the DATE services they received. Consequently, 
in 1993 researchers used 1992 results to enhance the research 
design. These processes provided researchers with an assessment 
of the DATE Program, ultimately &quot;grounded&quot; in the real-life 
experiences of participants (Berger and Luckmann, 1967; Blumer, 
1969; Garfinkel, 1967). 
<P> 
Initially, each researcher analyzed data independently. Then, 
approximately every two weeks, the qualitative team met for two 
days to go over their own assertions and to compare them with 
other group members' findings. Through researcher interaction 
during these meetings, a consensus was formed about the meaning 
of the social world represented by the data, thus yielding the 
qualitative findings presented in this report. 
<P> 
Findings are illustrated by exemplar statements taken directly 
from the data set that meet the criteria of inclusion determined 
by the working definition of each topic or category. <STRONG>Unless 
otherwise stated, each exemplar statement is indicative of a majority 
(more than 50 percent) of statements of that type. </STRONG> 
<H3>1993 Data collection </H3> 
 
<P> 
Four interviewers performed all 1993 interviews. Prior experience 
with 1992 interviews was supplemented with two days of additional 
training, this time emphasizing interview techniques appropriate 
for student groups. During the training, particular attention 
was given to methods of interviewing that make explicit the affective 
responses of students. Awareness of affective responses helped 
interviewers to be sensitive to students' needs, and cultural 
and ethnic backgrounds. Additionally, interviewers complied with 
the integrity and anonymity guidelines from 1992. 
<H3>1993 Data Analysis </H3> 
 
<P> 
For this study, all student data were included for analysis. The 
same analytical methods as previously described were repeated 
by a subset of the 1992 research team. Data analyses from 1993 
were performed using the same analytical approach as the previous 
year. Additional work performed was quantitative content analysis 
(Berelson, 1952) (i.e., statistics describing the number of occurrences 
of certain types of statements in focus groups). Additionally, 
from the 1993 quantitative data set (Romero, et al., 1994), previously 
unreported student survey results relevant to these findings are 
also presented. 
<H4>Reliability and Validity </H4> 
 
<P> 
In this study, researchers were aware of a potential source of 
selection bias. The DATE coordinator, a significant stakeholder, 
helped to arrange key informant interviews, thereby potentially 
exerting undue influence on key informants who might put the DATE 
Program's &quot;best foot forward.&quot; At the same time, given 
the logistics of this large-scale field evaluation, having the 
DATE coordinator in each selected district assist researchers 
assured that those members of the school district most involved 
in the implementation were included as informants. 
<P> 
Several strategies were employed to minimize the negative effects 
of potential sampling bias and to maximize the value of having 
those most closely associated with DATE describe the implementation 
process. First, researchers assured the anonymity of all key informants. 
Although the DATE coordinator might know who in their district 
was interviewed, through arrangement of private interview areas, 
the reiteration of anonymity before the interview and confidential 
coding processes, only interviewers would know what was said by 
any particular key informant. Second, organizational positions 
from which coordinators had discretion to arrange interviews were 
the same across districts. Third, in addition to those participants 
selected by the DATE coordinator, researchers designated specific 
organizational positions (e.g., Assistant Superintendent responsible 
for the DATE Program supervisor, the District Financial Officer, 
etc.) who were required to participate as informants. The multiple 
cross- district positions represented in the sample made it difficult 
for any one person to assert undue influence. Nevertheless, if 
it existed, information regarding the application of pressure 
to key informants was precisely part of what researchers hoped 
to uncover. Researchers' awareness of this factor provided an 
early and consistent constant comparative basis between those 
selected by the coordinator and those selected by researchers. 
The contrast of a researcher selected key informants with DATE 
coordinator-selected key informants provided researchers with 
an opportunity to constantly compare data within and between districts. 
<P> 
The methods of collection and analysis created an effective tool 
to look at the potential effects of selection bias (Glaser and 
Strauss, 1967; Kirk and Miller, 1986; Strauss and Corbin, 1990; 
LeCompte and Preissle, 1993). These methods include collecting 
confidential semi-structured interviews and data analysis using 
a multi-disciplinary team, and performing constant comparisons 
within and between interviews and study years. 
<P> 
In taking the grounded theoretical approach, researchers generated 
emergent assertions from these data. If this were an experimental 
design, the selection bias issue might be considered a significant 
threat to reliability and validity. Instead, in this qualitative 
evaluation, with the awareness of this potential bias in mind, 
the data collection and analytical methods helped to uncover informant 
bias, thus helping to insure study reliability and validity.

<P> 
To provide a context for new findings when available, researchers 
also present findings that have been previously reported (Brown 
et al.,1993). In this way, the student's view of the development 
and implementation of DATE services can be compared with the perspective 
of school district personnel. 
<H3><A NAME="context"><STRONG>What is the philosophical context 
of the DATE Program?</STRONG> </A></H3> 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="#implementation"><I>(Top of Section)</I></A> 
<P> 
In this section, researchers describe the guiding philosophy that 
school district personnel use when developing and implementing 
DATE services. This is important for two reasons. First, it provides 
the social context of DATE Program development and implementation. 
Second, the social context provides a description of norms that 
school district personnel hold about DATE, and in turn, what is 
acceptable (or unacceptable) to deliver as a DATE service. The 
prevailing philosophical context, &quot;the risk orientation,&quot; 
is referred to as a &quot;construct.&quot; 
<P> 
In the following section researchers show that the &quot;risk 
orientation&quot; is the dominant construct informants use as 
a rationale for implementing DATE services. It includes four elements 
defining the relationship of the &quot;risk orientation&quot; 
to student prevention programming: 
<OL> 
<LI>School district personnel use the terms substance &quot;use&quot; 
and substance &quot;abuse&quot; interchangeably. 
<LI>Using prevention science risk factors, school district personnel 
perceive a majority of students to be &quot;at-risk&quot; for 
becoming substance abusers. 
<LI>When describing their mission to work with &quot;at-risk&quot; 
students school district personnel equated &quot;at-risk&quot; 
and &quot;high-risk.&quot; 
<LI>Discussion of protective factors to prevent substance use 
and/or abuse is noticeably absent from school district personnel 
interviews. 
</OL> 
 
<P> 
Researchers present exemplars of the risk orientation in the same 
order as the elements described above. 
<P> 
(1) The terms use and abuse are used interchangeably. Informants 
discuss substance use in the same way they discuss substance abuse: 
<P> 
<CITE>R: I'd like to think the message is drug abuse is life abuse, 
which is our slogan and everyone knows that slogan. I think the 
message is that drug, alcohol, and tobacco, substance abuse or 
substance use, is not acceptable...</CITE> 
<P> 
I: So use equals abuse for any of those substances? 
<P> 
R: Yes (#292, p. 5). 
<P> 
Respondents described any substance use as abuse. The following 
exchange, typical of interviewers probing for accuracy, confirms 
the interpretation of the use/abuse equation: 
<P> 
<CITE>I: Drug&#173;free meaning?</CITE> 
<P> 
R: Alcohol&#173; drug&#173; tobacco&#173;free world. 
<P> 
I: So, then, I don't want to put any words in your mouth, but 
my impression is that any use of any of these substances by students 
equals abuse? 
<P> 
R: Yes (#227, p. 3). 
<P> 
These preceding excerpts show how the terms substance &quot;use&quot; 
and &quot;abuse&quot; are used interchangeably. 
<P> 
(2) Using &quot;prevention science&quot; risk factors, a majority 
of students are perceived to be &quot;at-risk&quot; for becoming 
substance abusers and; (3) When describing their mission to work 
with &quot;at-risk&quot; students, informants equate &quot;at-risk&quot; 
and &quot;high-risk.&quot; We link findings (2) and (3) because 
informants often linked them. When describing a typical &quot;at-risk&quot; 
student, informants used individual and interpersonal prevention 
science risk factors to link students, their families, and a possible 
&quot;dependency on some type of drug&quot; (Coie et al., 1993; 
Hawkins et al., 1992). 
<P> 
<CITE>I: What is the problem?</CITE> 
<P> 
R: The problem is that they're (students) living with families, 
someone in their family is dependent, some kind of dependency 
on some type of drug, so you know that it affects their personality 
(#231, p. 6). 
<P> 
As stated in the 1991&#173;92 DATE Application (p. 3), &quot;family 
substance use&quot; represents a description of a substance &quot;abuse&quot; 
risk factor (California Department of Education, 1991). When it 
came to the potential for substance &quot;abuse,&quot; many informants 
also believed a majority of students fit into the &quot;at-risk&quot; 
category: 
<P> 
<CITE>R: We are addressing the risk factors that show up, with 
the idea that it's real hard for me to point out which of our 
kids are not at risk (#014, p. 13).</CITE> 
<P> 
The first exemplar shows that the &quot;at-risk&quot; student 
is seen as possessing risk characteristics as defined in prevention 
science literature. The second exemplar shows that informants 
perceive a majority of students as &quot;at-risk&quot; for substance 
abuse. In the following exemplar discussing the mission of DATE, 
these two ideas are brought together. When asked to state the 
mission of the DATE Program, respondents linked the identification 
of students with risk factors, and the perception of widespread 
risk among students: 
<P> 
<CITE>R: I think that it is to identify and provide services for 
high&#173;risk students.</CITE> 
<P> 
I: What about non-high&#173;risk students? 
<P> 
R: If you look at our district demographics, we have a ton of 
kids that are high&#173;risk kids, we have a high Chapter One 
count, we have a high Special Ed count, so that means a majority 
of our kids, I would consider at risk anyway. We have a whole 
lot of at&#173;risk kids; high&#173;risk kids are kids that have 
a discipline history; they are kids that have poor attendance 
rates; they are kids that we know that are having lots of CPS 
[Child Protective Service] referrals, so they're going to take 
a different level of intervention (#210, p. 4). 
<P> 
Here, constructs such as &quot;discipline histories,&quot; &quot;poor 
attendance rates,&quot; and &quot;lots of CPS referrals&quot; 
define the respondent's notion of both &quot;at-risk&quot; and 
&quot;high risk.&quot; &quot;Special Ed&quot; and &quot;Chapter 
1&quot; are used as referents to &quot;at-risk&quot; populations. 
In the same way that use is equated with abuse, &quot;at-risk&quot; 
is equated with &quot;high risk.&quot; The mission of informants 
is to identify and assist these students. 
<P> 
(4) Discussion of the use of protective factors to prevent substance 
use and/or abuse is noticeably absent. Some researchers believe 
that risk factors may predict which types of students in a population 
are likely to become substance users and abusers, and that protective 
factors are equally important: they are viewed as those factors 
that a child or adolescent may possess or experience which, despite 
risk, may keep that child or adolescent from becoming a substance 
&quot;abuser.&quot; One example may be the protective factor of 
&quot;bonding&quot; with any significant adult (Werner, 1986). 
Here, it is believed that if a child or adolescent can find a 
significant adult to bond with, in even the worst risk circumstances, 
this child or adolescent may be &quot;protected&quot; from substance 
use and/or abuse. 
<P> 
In qualitative research, when comparing incident after incident 
of data occurrences, it is considered of proven theoretical relevance 
to observe concepts that are repeatedly present or absent (Strauss 
and Corbin, 1990). Although protective factors are mentioned in 
the DATE application, the noticeable lack of discussion of protective 
factors as a strategy in substance use and abuse prevention showed 
that an orientation toward risk factors appeared to be of primary 
consideration to the majority of school district personnel.. 
<P> 
In contrast, a few respondents described alternatives to the risk 
orientation. Rather than focusing on &quot;at-risk&quot; students, 
a minority of school district personnel described developing and 
implementing programs in which cultural norms are taken into account 
and distinctions between substance use and abuse are made (See 
Appendix 3). The few respondents taking this alternative view 
displayed a notable absence of the risk orientation. 
<P> 
In this section, researchers have shown that the &quot;risk orientation&quot; 
is the dominant construct used by informants as a rationale for 
implementing DATE services. These results reveal the context shaping 
the development and implementation of DATE at the school district 
personnel level. Furthermore, this context provides a description 
of norms that school district personnel hold about DATE, and in 
turn, what is acceptable (or unacceptable) to deliver as a DATE 
service.

<EM>District Personnel Perspective:</EM> 
<P> 
As reported in the 1992 technical report (Brown, et al., 1993) 
and confirmed in the Interim Report (Romero, et al., 1993), school 
district personnel reported delivering a wide variety of prevention 
programs. These included DARE, Health and Science courses, Red 
Ribbon Week, assemblies, <EM>Here's Looking at You 2000</EM> and 
various counseling services. The most widely discussed services 
were DARE, Red Ribbon Week, and <EM>Here's Looking at You 2000</EM>. 
For DARE, Red Ribbon Week, and Assemblies, school district personnel 
often described inviting specialists such as police officers and 
ex-drug addicts to deliver and/or assist in delivery of such programs. 
<P> 
Intervention services discussed by school district personnel included 
outside referrals, counseling, alternative schools, and disciplinary 
measures, including detention, suspension, and expulsion. 
<P> 
<I>Student Perspective:</I> 
<P> 
Overall, <B>(in 95 percent of focus group interviews) </B>students 
reported specialists present to implement DATE services. In <B>21 
of 40 (52.5 percent)</B> interviews students reported that police 
officers, &quot;specialists&quot; trained to deliver the DARE 
curriculum, came into their schools to deliver DATE Programs. 
Twelve student focus group interviews reported specialists being 
brought in for anti-drug assemblies <B>(30 percent)</B>. In 8 
out of 40 student group interviews <B>(22.5 percent)</B>, students 
mentioned counselors as specialists.

<P> 
Results were calculated by accounting for all programs mentioned 
in each focus group. For example, if DARE and Health courses were 
mentioned during an interview, regardless of the number of times 
mentioned, this would be counted as mentioning two programs. Of 
these programs, DARE was most frequently mentioned, followed by 
Health/Science courses, Anti-Drug assemblies, Red Ribbon weeks, 
and counseling. Only two student focus groups reported receiving 
&quot;no&quot; DATE services. These results indicate that in <B>38 
of 40 (95 percent),</B> focus groups, students report receiving 
at least one DATE service. 
<P> 
Note that only counseling represents what might be termed an &quot;individualized&quot; 
DATE service. Every other significantly mentioned program is delivered 
to groups of students, otherwise known as &quot;mass application&quot; 
programs. These results are important because they begin to describe 
the student perspective of implementation.

<P> 
Notable about this finding is that DARE and anti-drug assemblies 
are most frequently reported at the elementary school level. For 
example, of a possible 100 percent of DARE programs that student 
focus groups reported, 76.19 percent were reported at the elementary 
school level. Of 100 percent of Health courses, 41.18 percent 
were reported by high and middle school focus groups, respectively. 
The remainder of these data indicates that most Red Ribbon weeks 
and counseling are reported at the high school level: health courses 
are most frequently reported in middle and high schools. 
<P> 
In confirming percentages of implementation reports, these findings 
corroborate quantitative implementation findings. For example, 
in the larger quantitative data set, personnel from 120 school 
districts reported delivering DARE in 49 percent of schools (Romero, 
et al., 1993, p.4/15). This compares with 52 percent of our student 
focus groups reporting DARE programs. Additionally, in the larger 
quantitative data set 41 percent of school district personnel 
reported implementing health curricula (Romero, et al.,1993, p.4/15). 
This compares with 42 percent of students in student focus groups 
who reported participating in health/science curricula. Such cross 
verification using alternative data sources provides what is called 
&quot;triangulation.&quot; By comparing results from different 
sources (i.e., what DATE services school district personnel say 
they are implementing versus what DATE services students say they 
receive), triangulation helps researchers confirm or disconfirm 
results (LeCompte, and Preissle, 1993). 
<P> 
These results are important for three reasons. First, they show 
that students confirm the programs school district personnel say 
they are delivering. Second, they show that most student focus 
groups report receiving these DATE services. Third, students provide 
in-depth descriptions of how they experience DATE services. 
<P> 
<I>Implementation of Drug Policies</I> 
<P> 
Drug policies: 
<P> 
To assess another part of implementation, researchers examined 
the overall extent to which students describe awareness of drug 
policies. 
<P> 
Regarding drug policies, overall content analysis showed that 
in <B>39 of 40 (97.5 percent)</B> interviews researchers found 
clear student descriptions of substance use/abuse school policy. 
 
<P> 
Almost all student discussion of policies specified negative sanctions 
for use. When asked or volunteering what happens to a student 
who is caught using a substance at school, more than 90 percent 
of the student groups reported one or more of the following three 
elements: detention, suspension, or expulsion. The following excerpts 
from different school-level focus groups are representative of 
the entire data set: 
<P>

<P> 
These results indicate that both perceived &quot;at-risk&quot; 
and &quot;thriving&quot; are aware of unambiguous drug policies. 
Overall, it can be said that student groups at elementary, middle, 
and high school levels are aware of the consequences of being 
caught using substances at school. This demonstrates implementation 
of school drug policies. Few descriptions of policies designed 
to assist students were found. This is important, because by showing 
that the overall orientation in schools is toward enforcement 
of &quot;no use&quot; policies, students describe an important 
part of the climate in which drug education takes place. 
<P> 
In this section, researchers have shown that DATE services and 
policies have been implemented. The most frequently reported services 
are DARE, Red Ribbon Weeks, Health and Science courses, assemblies, 
and counseling. Most DARE and Red Ribbon Weeks tended to be reported 
at the elementary school levels, and most counseling was reported 
at the high school levels. Researchers have also presented evidence 
that tough &quot;no-use&quot; school anti-drug policies are in 
place. More than 90 percent of such policies had to do with punitive 
measures such as detention, suspension, and/or expulsion.

<P> 
Among the top five reported DATE services, within school levels 
comparing &quot;risk&quot; and &quot;thriving&quot; students, 
there is no discernible pattern of service differences; nor is 
there a pattern of &quot;at-risk&quot; youth reporting more individualized 
services (counseling) than &quot;thriving&quot; youth. In fact, 
if researchers compare across school levels, we find that at the 
middle and high school levels, only two of nine &quot;at-risk&quot; 
groups report receiving counseling. When looking at the &quot;thriving&quot; 
students, we see a reversal of this trend, showing that six groups 
participate in counseling, and two do not. Please note that the 
predominant discussion of the &quot;thriving&quot; students regarding 
counseling focused on their participation as peer counselors. 
This is a further indication of their participation in the school 
community. Additionally, since researchers probed for all types 
of counseling, the fact that &quot;at-risk&quot; students did 
not generally discuss participating in counseling, (including 
peer counseling) suggests that such services are not widely available. 
Precisely when students are making substance use decisions, during 
middle and high school, &quot;at-risk&quot; students do not report 
being involved in counseling. 
<P> 
These results show no pattern of evidence supporting specialized 
services for at-risk youth. This is important because, in the 
DATE Program, at-risk youth have been specially targeted for primary 
services, and our evidence suggests they are receiving services 
that are no different from other students. Results show that students 
&quot;at-risk for substance abuse&quot; are identified, but they 
do not report receiving targeted prevention services. 
<H3><A NAME="strategies">What instructional strategies are used 
to prevent students from using substances?</A> </H3> 
 
<P> 
<A HREF="#implementation"><I>(Top of Section)</I></A> 
<P> 
Underlying DATE services are what we call &quot;instructional 
strategies.&quot; Instructional strategies are methods of influence 
that DATE service deliverers employ to deter students from using 
substances. They are important to understand for three reasons. 
First, they transcend types of DATE services, providing us with 
valuable knowledge about the processes used to deter students 
from using substances. Second, these particular processes or methods 
of influence can be tied to a vast research literature. This, 
in turn, can help us understand the likelihood of deterring students 
from using substances when these strategies are used. Third, instructional 
strategies help to explain the overall effectiveness of the DATE 
Program. 
<P> 
<I>School District Personnel Perspective:</I> 
<P> 
In this section, researchers describe three processes through 
which DATE Program deliverers attempt to influence students regarding 
substance use decisions. The first are called &quot;harmful consequences&quot; 
programs. In such programs, service deliverers attempt to influence 
students not to use substances through graphic portrayals or presentations 
of the consequences of substance use. The second type include 
&quot;reward&#173;type&quot; programs. In reward&#173;type programs, 
service deliverers attempt to influence students not to use substances 
by offering a reward in exchange for the commitment not to use 
substances. The third type include &quot;self&#173;esteem&quot; 
building programs. Most service deliverers who use self&#173;esteem 
strategies describe teaching students substance use refusal skills 
in the context of self&#173; esteem and decision-making. These 
instructional strategies are consistently found across grade levels, 
size of school district, and span both prevention and intervention 
services. 
<P> 
<I>Instructional Strategy #1: Harmful Consequences of Substance 
Use</I> 
<P> 
Following are two of the more creative examples of presentations 
to students which represent a harmful consequence strategy: 
<P> 
(1) 
<P> 
<I><B>They've done an activity, I'm not sure what this is really 
called, but, where they paint the faces white of the student and 
that student is dead and they do so many students every few seconds 
depicting that is how many people die in traffic accidents on 
a major holiday weekend. Then the student returns to class and 
is not allowed to speak the rest of the day. (Laughter) It makes 
an impact (#288 p. 5).</B></I> 
<P> 
(2) 
<P> 
<I><B>They turn the (drug&#173;search) dogs in, the dogs don't 
pay one bit of attention to the kids! They immediately go around 
scouring the room. They never fail. When it's all over, they bring 
the dogs out to the exit and the kids get to pet the dogs as they 
go out. A lot of our things are rather mechanical and you can't 
really say somebody has been up there lecturing to the children 
(#015, pp. 4&#173;5).</B></I> 
<P> 
The &quot;harmful consequences of substance use&quot; strategy 
was by far, the most often described. It is linked with programs 
such as DARE, Red Ribbon Weeks, Assemblies, and Health/Science 
Courses. It is not linked with professional counseling strategies. 
<P> 
<I>Instructional Strategy #2: Reward&#173;Type Programs</I> 
<P> 
A reward&#173;type program is depicted in the following passage: 
<P> 
<I><B>R: When we do these things we have T&#173;shirts we've made 
up that we give to the</B></I> 
<P> 
kids, number one as a reward for doing it for us, number two to 
promote what 
<P> 
we are doing. We have poster contests, essay contests, and we 
give out a zillion 
<P> 
awards to the kids (#275, pp. 13&#173;14). 
<P> 
Statements of this type occur often in the interview data. Therefore, 
the interviewers probed for respondents' sense of efficacy of 
this strategy. When asked whether this method of influence has 
a positive effect, this respondent, who was representative of 
many others interviewed, said: 
<P> 
<I><B>R: Sure, I think so. Besides that, I think it is a great 
visible reward for kids. Let's say the kid draws the poster and 
the poster becomes a billboard, what a wonderful feeling. Plus 
when you are drawing the poster, you are not just drawing the 
poster, the teacher is also helping you learn more about tobacco 
and why it is bad for you and what the results could be so you 
can do a good poster. So, you are learning as you are doing and, 
I think, that is to the child's benefit.</B></I> 
<P> 
I: You have mentioned the word reward a couple times. Is that 
what they're supposed to be rewarded, I mean, there is an attempt 
to influence them. 
<P> 
R: You don't always have to have rewards, but public recognition 
of children's efforts is very sweet and long-lasting. 
<P> 
I: I hear your voice and you're smiling, what is that? 
<P> 
R: Well, I think that children today have a lot of trauma and 
distress in their lives and when they can have something pleasant 
and rewarding, not rewarding, but recognition by adults that their 
message is important, that they are listened to, that is part 
of it. 
<P> 
I: It has its own intrinsic reward? 
<P> 
R: Yes it does (#394, pp. 10&#173;11). 
<P> 
Once again, offering rewards and prizes is a prominent strategy 
used in the DATE services such as DARE, Red Ribbon Week, and assemblies 
to promote contests. Rewards were not found within professional 
counseling services nor health/science courses. 
<P> 
<I>Instructional Strategy #3: Self&#173;Esteem Building Programs</I> 
<P> 
The majority of respondents discussing the self-esteem instructional 
strategy believed that students would be deterred from substance 
use through what is called &quot;decision-making.&quot; Although 
they called it &quot;decision-making,&quot; respondents describe 
one reasonable action for students, choosing not to use any substances. 
The following illustrates a typical scenario posed to students 
by those using the self&#173;esteem strategy: 
<P> 
<I><B>R: ...consider when you're out at the beach and somebody 
comes over with a keg of beer and you're the responsible driver 
and you know what's going to happen. How do you gracefully decline 
that kind of hospitality, without looking like a nerd and being 
a social outcast from that day forward? (#001, p. 8)</B></I> 
<P> 
The previous passage represents decision-making within a no&#173;use 
framework. 
<P> 
On the other hand, as a means of substance use prevention, a minority 
of participants discussed self&#173;esteem building and a curriculum 
to develop decision-making skills. That is, through the building 
of self&#173;esteem, students are empowered to make their own 
decisions regarding substance use. This is decision-making within 
a self&#173;esteem and coping skill context. Accompanying the 
strategy to develop self&#173;esteem and decision-making skills 
is a presumption of trust in the autonomous decision-making abilities 
of students: 
<P> 
<I><B>R: ...giving you as much information as we can to allow 
you to make the best possible decision and choice about what it 
is you want to do with your life, because we know we don't have 
control over the decisions you make (#002, p. 9).</B></I> 
<P> 
During such discussion about the DATE Program, words like &quot;decision&quot; 
and &quot;choice&quot; distinguish these respondents from others 
who talk about self-esteem. Compared with the majority view of 
self-esteem, choice and decision-making-type statements provide 
evidence of an entirely different orientation. In the present 
context, these words are used by school district personnel attempting 
to build self&#173;esteem through student empowerment. This is 
distinguished from the majority of school district personnel, 
who use the words &quot;decision-making,&quot; but actually mean 
that the only acceptable decision for students is no substance 
use. 
<P> 
While many respondents talked about self&#173;esteem, few actually 
described how they implement this instructional model. It appears 
that the self&#173;esteem and coping&#173;skills methods are not 
as common in the data as the other two instructional strategies, 
yet it is a significant instructional strategy that respondents 
describe. These strategies are most often linked with DARE, Health 
and Science courses, and <I>Here's looking at you 2000</I>. 
<P> 
<I>Student perspective of instructional strategies:</I> 
<P> 
Following are excerpts from student interviews that typify the 
knowledge that students retain and report from the programs they 
receive. Exemplars are presented from all three school levels. 
To show that there is virtually no difference between risk and 
thriving groups on this dimension, excerpts represent both risk 
and thriving points of view at each level:<BR>

The previous excerpts are typical of student focus groups' responses 
to questions asking them about what they learned and how they 
learned it. Although in some cases, researchers found a qualitative 
difference in the ability to articulate what they learned, both 
&quot;at-risk&quot; and &quot;thriving&quot; groups described 
curriculum focusing on the harmful effects of substance use as 
abuse. It is certain that the harmful effects of substance use/abuse 
have been taught, and for the most part, retained as retrievable 
knowledge by students. When describing harmful consequences, students 
also described what school district personnel described as self-esteem 
in the context of refusal skills: 
<P> 
<I><B>R: He taught us the different ways you can walk away, like 
&quot;broken record&quot; and just saying the same things, over 
and over again. Just avoiding the um, situations. And what else? 
Um, [pauses]</B></I> 
<P> 
I: How to do a distraction, maybe? 
<P> 
R: Yeah! 
<P> 
R: Or talk about something else, change the subject (618, p.3). 
<P> 
Different ways to say &quot;no&quot; are part of the retrievable 
knowledge gained by students experiencing DATE. It should be noted 
that, in many circumstances, students reported receiving some 
sort of reward, such as pencils, prizes, or ribbons. As previously 
described, offering a reward represents an instructional strategy 
used to prevent substance use. 
<P> 
The instructional strategies found are consistent throughout DATE 
services. Students confirm this cross-service consistency: 
<P> 
<I><B>I: And how did you learn that it ruins their health?</B></I> 
<P> 
R: Through the science book and DARE, through everything, everything 
they teach you (#562, p.11). 
<P> 
These findings indicate that students are receiving the knowledge 
that DATE service deliverers want them to receive. Students are 
aware of certain issues regarding substance use. In the educational 
literature, this is known as &quot;knowledge transfer.&quot; The 
primary instructional strategies used to gain such a knowledge 
transfer are (in order of most prevalent): direct instruction 
of harmful consequences, self-esteem in the context of refusal 
skills, and the offer of rewards in return for a promise not to 
use substances. We have found that these strategies transcend 
types of services, and are not dependent on whether students are 
&quot;at-risk&quot; for substance abuse or &quot;thriving&quot; 
in their school. 
<P> 
The finding that &quot;at-risk&quot; youth describe the same instructional 
strategies as their &quot;thriving&quot; counterparts provides 
confirmation that services are not targeted toward those perceived 
to be &quot;at-risk for substance abuse.&quot; Given the depth 
of interviews themselves, the breadth of the interviews across 
districts, and interviewers' training to probe for all types of 
services, it is unlikely that researchers would not have uncovered 
any significant services delivered to these students. Following, 
we describe how students are affected by these services, and the 
instructional strategies underlying them.

<B>For the remainder of this report we show how students describe 
being affected by DATE services. Following, in effect, is the 
story of DATE from the student's perspectives. In it, researchers 
show how students report being affected by DATE services and what 
they would like to see in DATE services. We begin with an examination 
of the student perception of what constitutes substance &quot;abuse&quot; 
problems, complimented by the extent to which students in grades 
7 through 12 report being influenced by DATE services, and how 
they feel about such services. Findings will be completed with 
what students would like to see in DATE services.</B> 
<P> 
<I>Student responses to DATE services</I> 
<P> 
In 1992, the first year of the DATE evaluation data collection 
and analysis, researchers found that most school district personnel 
did not distinguish between substance use and abuse. Why may this 
be a very important qualitative examination? Part of the mission 
of the DATE Program is to influence students to adopt a &quot;no-use&quot; 
attitude and behavior toward substances. If students felt the 
same way about this substance use/abuse distinction that DATE 
service deliverers did, then, depending on what students said, 
it could indicate that service deliverers are positively influencing 
students. If, on the other hand, students made a distinction that 
contradicted and/or elaborated what was being taught to them, 
then it could indicate little influence of the program, or perhaps 
merely typical adolescent rebellion to authority figures. The 
importance of this factor depends on if and how students describe 
the distinction between substance use and abuse. 
<P> 
Content analysis revealed that in <B>37 of 40 (92.5 percent)</B> 
interviews, students made clear distinctions between substance 
use and substance abuse. This was defined by the extent to which 
specific substances are described, and an example is provided 
showing use or resultant behaviors not perceived to be harmful, 
versus use or behaviors that are. On 74 occasions in 37 interviews, 
students described the distinction between use and abuse. The 
following qualitative excerpt from an elementary thriving group 
is an exemplar of this type: 
<P> 
<I><B>R: [first] Like if he asked me---it's just kind of like 
the person, like, see my uncle, he can drink and he won't get 
drunk and then my other uncle he can drink a couple of beers and 
he will get drunk and get into stuff...</B></I> 
<P> 
R: [second] Like my dad he can drink like three or four beers 
and he doesn't really get drunk, he gets kind of weird [said with 
a kind of laugh], but he doesn't get drunk and if my mom if she 
drinks anything alcoholic she gets really sick, because he, I 
mean, my dad used to drink more than he does now. I mean, lately 
he has maybe one beer a month and my mom doesn't drink. So, it 
just kind of depends on the attitude of the person before they 
drink, too, because if they're already violent then if they drink 
they might get even more violent and then if it doesn't bother 
them, you know. 
<P> 
I: Does the DARE officer teach you those things? 
<P> 
R: [third] No, not really. 
<P> 
R: [different respondent, hard to identify] I don't think so. 
<P> 
I: So how did you come to know that? Just by watching? 
<P> 
R: [second] You just kind of know it. [short laugh] [second respondent 
says &quot;Yes&quot; in the background] You know just by observing 
your surroundings and you can tell how people act. I mean, all 
families have different examples of stuff but you can just about 
get any family with somebody that drinks (#567, pp.5-6). 
<P> 
The preceding passage exemplifies the use/abuse distinctions that 
even the youngest student groups made. On this dimension of effectiveness, 
there was a developmental component: it appears that as school 
level increased, so did the sophistication of distinctions between 
use and abuse. The prevalence and types of the use/abuse distinctions 
are negative indicators of effectiveness. There is evidence that 
the program is in place; there is evidence that the students hear 
the message that use equals abuse, and that there are harmful 
consequences for any substance use. However, possibly because 
of the combination of service deliverers teaching that use equals 
abuse, and students consistently distinguishing between substance 
use and abuse, evidence begins to suggest that the influence of 
program deliverers is limited. 
<P> 
Compared with the previous elementary school distinction between 
use and abuse, when middle school students discussed their use/abuse 
distinction, they described their dissatisfaction with what they 
receive in school, linked with the fact those service deliverers 
do not make such a distinction. The following data shows that 
these students have both heard and understood the &quot;no use&quot; 
message, but they question the veracity and the motives of those 
providing this information: 
<P> 
<I><B>R: I think it's nothing! It's exaggeration! </B></I> 
<P> 
R: They lie to you so you won't do it!... 
<P> 
R: Oh, they lie to you so that you won't do the drugs! They think 
you're dumb! 
<P> 
I: Do you think that works? 
<P> 
R: No. [laughs] 
<P> 
I: Do you think that's what they really do? 
<P> 
R: Yeah, sometimes (#508 p.10). 
<P> 
By shifting discussion from a mere distinction between use and 
abuse, to embedding this discussion in a context of drug education, 
this middle school data represents a more sophisticated understanding 
of use and abuse than the elementary-level students. 
<P> 
Compared with the middle school students, when making a use/abuse 
distinction, high school students shift their perception to the 
context, type of substance used, and level of use: 
<P> 
<I><B>R: Get drunk at a party is fine! Mothers Day, get drunk! 
I'm not saying for me...I'm just saying these are parents, right? 
If my mom gets drunk, I don't care! On Mothers Day she totally 
had a good time, but she didn't drive home. She felt sick in the 
morning, but she had a good time and that's fine. If I knew she 
was an alcoholic, I'd get her help! But, yeah, she gets drunk, 
but not every day! Not once a week! </B></I> 
<P> 
I: Okay. 
<P> 
R: She does have drinks though. 
<P> 
I: Is that what they teach you in the classes? 
<P> 
R: No. [in unison] 
<P> 
R: They teach that us that everything is bad! 
<P> 
R: Yup! 
<P> 
R: It's just flat out bad (#507 p.14). 
<P> 
These findings show that student distinctions between use and 
abuse occur at all school levels. Similar to other research findings, 
this evidence shows that students make use/abuse distinctions 
based on elements found in their social world (i.e., types of 
substances, levels of use, and using circumstances) (Klitzner, 
1987; Shedler and Block, 1990; Baizerman and Compton, 1992; Brown 
and Horowitz, 1993). Their understanding of such distinctions 
emanates primarily from sources outside schools (e.g., family 
members, friends, and personal experience). Our evidence suggests 
that as students become older, the difference between their drug 
education and personal knowledge becomes a significant source 
of dissatisfaction regarding DATE services. This finding is important 
because it shows that service deliverers are not perceived as 
having a significant influence on student attitudes or behavior. 
<P> 
Although this is not an experimental study, that is, we do not 
maintain a cause and effect relationship between the state, the 
risk factor model, and student program perceptions, these findings 
do suggest that some of the program difficulties may be traced 
to the differences in perceptions between school district personnel 
and students, referred to as a &quot;mismatch.&quot; 
<P> 
<I>Student responses to DATE drug policies:</I> 
<P> 
Researchers examined the extent to which students describe their 
belief that such policies were beneficial. 
<P> 
This item includes the student data describing their affective 
response to clearly delineated policies. Do perceived &quot;at-risk&quot; 
and &quot;thriving&quot; students feel the same or differently 
about the primary drug policies? Our findings reveal that a majority 
of focus groups discussing this topic felt that the consequences 
of substance use were not supportive of students needing help 
for substance use problems: 
<P> 
<I><B>High School: Risk</B></I> 
<P> 
R: I don't think the schools are for like helping it's just for 
getting the bad kids out and it's just... 
<P> 
R: Yeah. 
<P> 
R: Especially at first, if you need help they tell people to go 
to like [name of institution], get your fix, you know, come back 
and we'll get you back on your feet, you know?...They are not 
in this for helping you, they are in for getting rid of the bad 
kids and just having all good kids in school. [spoken very emphatically]... 
<P> 
R: Well, maybe if you could get them to care more then they would 
do that [a different respondent than the others above]. 
<P> 
R: If they suspect you of smoking or having drugs on you or whatever, 
if they see a kid like that in their school then, instead of suspending 
them and getting them out of school, why don't they help then? 
(#531, p.21) 
<P> 
High School: Thriving 
<P> 
R: Yes, because I do know, I had a friend who had a real rough 
time trying to go straight! 
<P> 
I: Cause there wasn't any help available? 
<P> 
R: There, at this school, no! [very emphatic] 
<P> 
I: Is anybody here aware of what you do if you had a friend say, 
who was real involved and you wanted to try to get 'em off drugs? 
Is there any resource here, that you know about? 
<P> 
R: Not really. 
<P> 
R: No. 
<P> 
R: I haven't heard of any. 
<P> 
R: Not at this school! (#593 p.8) 
<P> 
In addition to doubting the veracity of the information they receive, 
these results show that a majority of these middle and high school 
group students are aware of what a drug problem is; many question 
why the school is not helping them or their friends when they 
have such a problem.

Here, qualitative researchers provide a key linkage with the larger 
DATE quantitative evaluation. As a result of the 1992 qualitative 
findings, in 1993 qualitative researchers designed items to be 
administered in the grade 7 through 12 student survey. These items 
were developed based on a combination of 1992 instructional strategy 
data and social influence literature. It is important to note 
that grade 7 through 12 is the period when in school students 
are most likely make substance use decisions. These questions 
are central to understanding the effectiveness of DATE services. 
Researchers provide these questions, survey results of 5,045 students, 
and a supporting qualitative exemplar. 
<P> 
Please See Table 1. 
<P> 
Question 1 describes student responses to the item, &quot;How 
much was your decision to use or not use tobacco, alcohol, or 
other drugs due to the classes and activities in your school?&quot; 
43 percent of students say that they were &quot;not at all&quot; 
affected by the drug classes and activities in their schools. 
No other choice to this item received more than a 20 percent response. 
 
<P> 
Question 2 describes student responses to the item, &quot;How 
much was your decision to use or not use tobacco, alcohol, or 
other drugs due to people (e.g., teachers, counselors, coaches) 
providing classes and activities?&quot; This data virtually repeats 
the percentages of influence found in Figure 1; 40.9 percent of 
students report not being affected &quot;at all&quot; by the <I>people</I> 
who deliver DATE services. Again, no other choice to this item 
received more than a 20 percent response. 
<P> 
Question 3 describes student responses to the item, &quot;How 
much was your decision to use or not use tobacco, alcohol, or 
other drugs due to deciding on your own?&quot; These results show 
that 58.5 percent of students say that their substance use decisions 
were either &quot;a lot&quot; or &quot;completely&quot; due to 
themselves. No other item received more than a 20 percent response. 
<P> 
Please see table 2. Table 2 describes student responses to the 
question, &quot;How much do you like the people who provide you 
with tobacco, drugs and/or alcohol classes and activities?&quot; 
Notable about these results is that students are split on how 
much they &quot;like&quot; the people who deliver DATE services. 
Most students &quot;neither like or dislike&quot; DATE service 
deliverers. Most interesting though, are the nearly 23.4 percent 
of students who disliked DATE service deliverers &quot;a lot.&quot; 
No other choice to this item received more than a 20 percent response. 
<P> 
From these items surveying more than 5,000 students, an important 
social influence pattern is revealed. More than 40 percent of 
students say that their substance use decisions were &quot;not 
at all&quot; due to either the people or the DATE services they 
received. No other choice to these items received more than a 
20 percent student response. This is important because it means 
that a high percentage of these students do not attribute their 
decisions to &quot;in school&quot; DATE-related sources. Figure 
3 shows that the highest percentages of students responding to 
this item took responsibility for their substance use decision, 
saying that their substance use decisions were either &quot;completely,&quot; 
or &quot;a lot&quot; due to deciding on their own. Completing 
this pattern is question four, which shows that the highest percentage 
of students responding to this item, &quot;neither like nor dislike&quot; 
DATE service deliverers. Surprising about student responses are 
the 23.4 percent of students in grades 7 through 12 saying they 
dislike DATE service deliverers &quot;a lot.&quot; This is important 
because research literature shows that neutral and/or negative 
affect toward someone who is trying to influence another's behavior 
is likely to lead to a lack of, or short term, compliance (Brown 
and Raven, 1995; Raven, 1965; 1974; 1983; 1986; 1992; 1994). Overall, 
while some students may appear to be influenced by DATE services, 
the most germane pattern of these results show the opposite: that 
a high percentage of students are not influenced by DATE services, 
nor service deliverers; have a neutral to negative affect toward 
such service deliverers; and take responsibility for their substance 
use decisions.

In this section students describe what they want to see in their 
drug education programs. Consistent with some earlier results, 
the types of student statements varied as a function of their 
age, but not as a function of being designated as &quot;at-risk&quot; 
or &quot;thriving.&quot; Most suggestions, and the most sophisticated 
descriptions of them, took place at the high school level. The 
data emerging from this analysis is considered some of the most 
important in this study. At the high school levels, two focus 
groups (numbers 530 and 531) provided a particularly useful data 
set, representative of the entire body of similar findings. Consequently, 
in addition to presenting the percentage of focus groups making 
those types of statements, researchers provide high school evidence 
primarily from focus groups 530 and 531. Primary findings include: 
<UL> 
<LI>A desire for more complete drug information, delivered through 
a different educational process. 
<LI>More panels and talks by those who have been through both 
substance use and substance abuse. 
</UL> 
 
<P> 
Secondary findings include: 
<UL> 
<LI>A minimum number of focus groups wanted more harmful consequences 
(1/40[.025 percent]) to be taught, and harsher consequences for 
those who are caught (2/40[.05 percent]) using substances (2/40). 
Because of their small numbers, they are not further discussed. 
<LI>percent of high school focus groups mentioned that they wanted 
harm reduction programs, smaller groups rather than assemblies, 
and more counseling. 
</UL> 
 
<P> 
Immediately emerging at all school levels was the desire for more 
complete drug information delivered through a different educational 
process. 10 percent of elementary focus groups wanted these changes: 
<P> 
<I><B>R: [lead] Well like I said, he'll be talking about something 
and then when you like ask for more information [word said with 
a questioning voice] he like really doesn't want to come out like 
and tell us the whole thing. [spoken slowly and thoughtfully]</B></I> 
<P> 
I: Can you give me like---can you make up an example? [long pause, 
lead respondent heard making long &quot;ah&quot; sound] What do 
you mean he doesn't want to give you more information? 
<P> 
R: [lead] Like he doesn't want to... 
<P> 
R: [second] He doesn't want to tell you everything about it. 
<P> 
R: [lead] Everything like details. 
<P> 
I: Why not? 
<P> 
R: [lead] I guess that's just the way he is. I don't know. 
<P> 
I: How do you guys feel about that? 
<P> 
R: [lead] Depressed. Because if he's about talking to us about 
drugs and alcohol and all these kind of things he should come 
out with those, you know, he should talk to us the right---you 
know, with the whole thing, not just say a little bit and then 
just leave the rest behind. 
<P> 
R: [second] But another, like he'll only tell you <I><B>a little 
and then he'll go to a new thing(#568, pp.8-9).</B></I> 
<P> 
Here, students describe wanting more than &quot;a little&quot; 
drug education. These students link a repercussion with school-based 
drug information. Because this student feels that the DATE service 
deliverer does not come out with &quot;the whole thing,&quot; 
he says that it makes him feel &quot;...depressed....&quot; 
<P> 
Normally, data found in only 10 percent of focus groups might 
not be presented. However, we consider statements like this important, 
because similar statements (e.g., those linking DATE services 
with issues such as elementary depression, middle school sarcasm, 
and a high school decrease in educator credibility) were found 
to increase as school level increased. By constantly comparing 
elementary with middle and high school group interviews, researchers 
found that students increasingly linked DATE services with a lack 
of, or apparently negative affect toward, those services connected 
with what they want. As school level increased, this pattern increased 
from 10 percent (elementary school) to 33 percent (middle school) 
to more than 90 percent at the high school level. 
<P> 
At the middle school level, <B>33 percent</B> of focus groups 
wanted more information from those who had either used or abused 
substances. In the following two passages, students report awareness 
of substance &quot;abuse;&quot; while often being sarcastic, middle 
school students wanted more information through a different and 
more experiential process: 
<P> 
<I><B>I: ...What do you think that teachers or schools could do 
to really help kids with this stuff? If it could be really helpful, 
what...?</B></I> 
<P> 
R: <I><B>Um, try it and see if they like it! [being facetious?]</B></I> 
<P> 
<I><B>I: Let them try it? I don't think that's gonna happen!</B></I> 
<P> 
R: And I doubt that they would like it. 
<P> 
I: Yeah? Okay. What else can schools really do? 
<P> 
R: They should like, they should have a lot of things like that. 
<P> 
I: A lot of things like...? 
<P> 
R: Like drugs and stuff. Like regular users and stuff like that. 
Someone that's had what it can do to your body and stuff like 
that. 
<P> 
I: Uh huh? 
<P> 
R: Keep you out of class, too!... 
<P> 
R: They should bring like people that have done tobacco and like 
got messed up with their job or something! Stuff to show 'em that's 
how you handle it...(#606, pp.20-21). 
<P> 
(2) 
<P> 
I: ...Um, do you think that any of the information that you got 
at school, at this school, has influenced you either way in your 
own decision? As you get older and have to make those choices? 
<P> 
R: Not really. 
<P> 
I: You don't think that the class really had much impact? 
<P> 
R: No. 
<P> 
I: No? How about you? Do you think...? 
<P> 
R: Yes. It had an impact. 
<P> 
I: It what? 
<P> 
R: They said it was like bad for you! 
<P> 
R: You just tell 'em that it's bad for you! 
<P> 
I: Oh, bad for you! I'm sorry! I didn't understand...Um, who do 
you think ought to be teaching you about alcohol and tobacco and 
other drugs? 
<P> 
R: Somebody who has had a real problem with it. 
<P> 
I: Okay, and does still have a problem? 
<P> 
I: No! They got over it. 
<P> 
I: Somebody got over it? 
<P> 
R: Probably someone who still has a drug problem (#551, pp.6-10). 
<P> 
These data show that sarcasm/anger plays an important role at 
the middle school level. Similar to the use/abuse distinction, 
middle school sarcasm was often linked with some statement of 
DATE services not affecting them (Did it have an impact? R: No.) 
or sarcastically describing a negative impact (&quot;You just 
tell 'em that it's bad for you&quot;). Sarcasm is found in each 
of the previous two passages: &quot;Um, try it and see if they 
like it!&quot;, &quot;Keep you out of class, too!&quot; and &quot;You 
just tell 'em that it's bad for you.&quot; Linked with these types 
of statements is the desire for more information from someone 
outside of the school, namely people who are or have been substance 
users (&quot;regular users&quot;) and abusers (somebody who has 
a &quot;real drug problem&quot;). Rather than receiving &quot;just 
the facts,&quot; students have a desire to understand the experiences 
of substance users and abusers. While, in isolation, this may 
indicate elements typically found during adolescence, the fact 
that students explicitly link sarcasm with aspects of DATE services 
indicates their current disposition relative to these particular 
services. 
<P> 
At the high school level, well-articulated statements found in 
focus group interviews 530 and 531 came to represent the most 
prevalent changes students want. High school students tend to 
link what they want with program inefficacy through a lack of 
DATE service deliverer credibility. 
<P> 
<I><B>R: Yeah, but the Health teacher doesn't really know, you 
know.</B></I> 
<P> 
R: Oh yeah, the Health teacher doesn't know, he's reading from 
the book. 
<P> 
R: Yeah, he's just reading from the book, and if they had brought 
someone in that knew and that like went through it, I think it 
would be a lot better. 
<P> 
R: It's kind of like everybody knows that drugs and smoking are 
bad for you so it's not like a teacher can sit there and can pound 
it into you so you're not going to do it. I remember like in sixth 
grade our PE teacher would sit there [inaudible] and [inaudible] 
smoking, they all went along with it or whatever but it's like 
you are going to do it if you want, you're not going to listen 
to a teacher or a parent. If my parents sit there and say all 
the time, stop smoking, stop doing this, don't do anything, don't 
do any drugs, don't do anything bad when you go out. So they can 
say as much as they want, your best friend [inaudible], but you're 
only going to listen to yourself, it's not what they teach you, 
if you know it's bad. 
<P> 
I: Using or not using has something to do with your own decision? 
<P> 
R: [Loud responses from many voices] Yes(#531, pp.13-15). 
<P> 
By saying &quot;the Health teacher doesn't really know&quot; and 
then saying &quot;...if they had brought someone in that knew 
and that like went through it I think it would be a lot better&quot; 
these students link a lack of service efficacy with a lack of 
credibility and what they would like to see: change in the drug 
educational process from that of providing what we now know to 
be as only &quot;no-use&quot;, harmful consequence information 
to a movement toward an experiential educational format. In the 
high school data, statements like this were found in <B>90.91 
percent</B> of the focus groups. This desire for more information 
through a different process constituted the most prevalent student 
desire for program change. 
<P> 
In two ways, these data are supported by quantitative survey results 
reported earlier. First, although it represents grades 7-12, and 
this qualitative data is from high school students (grades 9-12), 
it supports the finding that 40.9 percent of the students said 
that the individuals delivering DATE services did not affect them 
&quot;at all.&quot; Second, when students take responsibility 
for drug decisions by saying &quot;...but you're only going to 
listen to yourself...,&quot; these data are linked with the finding 
that almost 58.5 percent of students in grades 7 through 12 believed 
that their substance use decision was either &quot;a lot&quot; 
or &quot;completely&quot; due to themselves. 
<P> 
At first, the next passage seems to indicate that students want 
more of what, to some extent, exists in today's drug education: 
addicts coming in and sharing their harmful consequences experiences. 
However, when interviewers probed, we found that they wanted more 
than that: 
<P> 
<I><B>I: Ok, let's do another question. Who do you think should 
be teaching you about alcohol, tobacco and drugs?</B></I> 
<P> 
R: Someone outside the school. 
<P> 
I: For example? 
<P> 
R: I don't know, yourself. 
<P> 
R: No, I think someone who has been through it. [several voices 
speak at once, sounds as if they are in agreement with this statement] 
<P> 
R: Someone outside the school... 
<P> 
I: Recovering addicts? 
<P> 
R: They know the most because they have been through it. They 
know how it feels. 
<P> 
R: They only tell you---like their stories are interesting and 
you want to hear about it. You know when you're sitting in the 
class and you're reading out of a book, you know, cigarettes cause 
emphysema, it's like that's great... 
<P> 
R: It's boring. 
<P> 
R: ...Yeah, so it's so boring, just like the other school classes, 
I mean, but we already know about it and that's not going to help 
us. We already know about it and it's not going to do anything. 
<P> 
I: So you agree with him that it needs to be an experiential thing... 
<P> 
R: [several voices at once] Yes. 
<P> 
R: If somebody does drugs, and if a teacher says it does this 
to you, you're not going to stop unless something happens to you 
or you see something happen to someone else, you know, one of 
your close friends or something and then you think about it, because 
when you're doing drugs or drinking or whatever, you don't think 
anything is going to happen to you, you just think, you know---(#531, 
pp. 28-29). 
<P> 
Students link a lack of efficacy and credibility (&quot;...but 
we already know about it and that's not going to help us...it's 
not going to do anything&quot;) with what they want to see, &quot;(1) 
Someone outside the school...(2) Someone like yourself [the interviewer]...(3) 
Someone who has been through it...&quot; The interviewer sought 
to probe exactly who from outside the school students thought 
should provide drug education: 
<P> 
<I><B>I#2: Can I back up for a second? It seems like someone said 
before that the point is that they are trying to scare you into 
not doing it, right?</B></I> 
<P> 
R: Yes! 
<P> 
I#2: Ok, now it seems like what you are asking for is someone 
to come in to scare you more into not doing it. 
<P> 
R: Not scare us more... 
<P> 
R: To interest us. 
<P> 
R: ...yes, we're not interested in like text books, you know, 
we're interested in someone who really has been through it and 
to see that is a lot more interesting, it <U>does</U> give you 
more which will probably make you <U>not</U> do it than just reading 
out of a text book. 
<P> 
I: So you're not arguing with what they tell you, you're arguing 
with how it's taught. 
<P> 
R: Yes. 
<P> 
R: Yes (#531, pp. 29-30). 
<P> 
Here, &quot;...we're not interested in like text books, you know, 
we're interested in someone who really has been through it...&quot; 
means that students want a change in the basic processes of drug 
education, from &quot;...someone who has been through it...&quot; 
During this particular probe, students did not specify who should 
be delivering these services. However, as indicated by the first 
portion of the passage, analysis reveals that these students, 
like a majority of other high school students, wanted both substance 
users and abusers to deliver such an education. They report wanting 
a drug education that &quot;interest[s] us [students].&quot; These 
findings are important because they show how students explain 
what they want in DATE services by embedding it in negative affect 
toward either services themselves or services deliverers. The 
extent of these negative feelings increased as school level increased. 
<P> 
To fully understand the construct of what students really want, 
it is important to retrospectively understand how high school 
students report their own development relative to DATE services. 
This passage, because it summarizes many of the student findings, 
placing them in a concise developmental and historical perspective, 
is considered to be one of the most important explanations of 
DATE Program efficacy. It is presented in its full context: 
<P> 
<I><B>I: ...You mentioned getting stuff in elementary school and 
junior high school, have all of you gotten something?</B></I> 
<P> 
R: [Several voices] Yes. 
<P> 
I: I'm wondering what happens between what you get---we've spoken 
to elementary school kids and junior high school kids and they 
all think that what they're getting is hard and what we're trying 
to figure out is what happens between elementary school and junior 
high school and then high school. 
<P> 
R: Reality. 
<P> 
R: Yeah. [Yes] 
<P> 
I: [Laugh] What do you mean reality? 
<P> 
R: When you're younger and much more impressionable you look up 
to your teachers, you take everything that they say, so you respect 
everything they say, you don't want to disappoint your teachers; 
your parents have certain expectations of you, the pressure is 
not on to do all that stuff when you're in elementary... 
<P> 
R: Actually the pressure is---it's just the opposite. I remember 
being invited to a party when I was in sixth grade and some guy 
lit up a cigarette and my boy friend threw him into the pool and 
everybody was like beating him up because he did that and now 
it's like--- [Laugh] 
<P> 
I: So what switched? 
<P> 
R: Well, what happened is that we, first of all, were influenced 
by other things when we were younger like we looked up to our 
super heros and our cartoon characters and the Sesame Street people 
and by the time you get to middle school you don't want to be 
like elementary school kids any more, you want to be like the 
high school kids, so you find out what they do at their parties 
and what your older brothers and sisters are doing. You also have 
more of your own mind, the teachers don't think you're as impressionable 
as you were when you were younger, they're not going to preach 
to you, so they're just going to tell you what is in the curriculum 
because really what they tell you is not going to really make 
an impact. I think what it would be neat to do is bring in recovering 
substance abusers who abused as teenagers and have them tell the 
class this is what happened to my life when I was an abuser and 
show them how it destroyed their life and that way teenagers can 
relate. When you're talking to somebody twenty years older than 
you who is going to preach to you Just Say No that kind of thing 
does not really get home, it doesn't last, you need something 
that is really, I don't know, kind of like our AIDS program. 
<P> 
R: [Several voices] Yeah. [Yes] 
<P> 
R: I also wanted to say that what I think that part of the problem 
seems to be is that any subject the teachers or anybody is really 
uncomfortable talking about it seems to all get pushed to the 
side and I think that more with drug and alcohol abuse, I think 
that it is something that people are very uncomfortable talking 
about. 
<P> 
I: You mean adults? 
<P> 
R: Yes, adults. I think that, especially, I guess, when you're 
in high school or junior high, also, when somebody says to you 
don't do this, because it's bad, you know, the automatic reaction 
of a teenager growing up is to say why is it bad? Everybody is 
curious about what this does, the way they're curious about anything 
and I think that by just saying that it's bad and just putting 
things in the curriculum is doing that without saying this is 
why, this is what can happen, and showing what can happen to you 
and presenting both sides realistically and when you don't do 
that then people don't know what the consequences are and are 
more apt to stray... 
<P> 
I: What's both sides? Sorry. 
<P> 
R: I think at the same time as presenting everything that is bad, 
you can't just preach one side, you have to somehow, I mean, you 
can't ignore that sometimes it feels good to be drunk and that 
sometimes it feels good to---you might want to smoke a joint, 
you might want to escape, I mean... 
<P> 
I: Yes, but then they say well that's promoting you guys using 
substances. 
<P> 
R: No, it is just admitting the fact that... 
<P> 
R: That temptation is there. I mean, just because you're saying, 
just like when we're talking about AIDS, just because we're saying 
if you're going to have sex use condoms does not mean I'm going 
to have sex now because you told me about that. It just means 
that if it happens I know what's out there because the more you 
know, the more you're prepared. Nobody ever said anything like 
that to me and I think when you get into high school it is just 
such a different world than junior high you want to fit in and 
explore everything so much and when you find out these things 
a lot of the old barriers come crashing down that you've had when 
you were in junior high. 
<P> 
R: I think the problem with education is---this kind of education 
is that you're constantly being shoved down your throat it's so 
wrong, if you do it you're a terrible, evil person, instead of 
just educating saying I know some of you people do it, why do 
you do it, let's try to help you so you don't do it any more. 
If it is shoved into you that you're a terrible person when you 
do this, you know, you kind of want to back away from the education 
process because they've already made a judgment upon you, you're 
a terrible person if you smoke marijuana, if you do alcohol, if 
you smoke cigarettes, you're a terrible person, instead of approaching 
it as, OK, you guys do it, let's help you now. 
<P> 
I: So then the goal should be to get people into not doing it. 
<P> 
R: No I'm not saying that, I'm saying the goal should be to evaluate 
yourself and figure out why you do it, evaluate your own personal 
habits and your personal values and morals. 
<P> 
R: I don't think it is realistic to assume that anyone is not 
going to try some things in their life, I mean, it's ridiculous 
that presidents---I think that is a part of growing up... 
<P> 
I: Finish that thought. 
<P> 
R: I think it's ridiculous that presidents get judged on their---if 
Bill Clinton inhaled or not, I think that's stupid. Everybody---we've 
talked about this in psychology, when you grow up you go through 
different experiences and you need to make mistakes and you make 
some things that aren't mistakes and that's how you learn and 
you don't want anyone to learn the very hard way by making huge 
mistakes, but it's OK if people make little mistakes and you can 
forgive them for those, you can forgive them for the big mistakes 
too, you know. I think it's very tough on a lot of kids thinking, 
OK, this is the way my parents want me to grow up, I'm supposed 
to do these kind of grades when I'm in junior high, have these 
friends and in high school I should be like this or whatever, 
and where is the room for experimenting so that you can expand 
your mind? I think if you educated students well enough they wouldn't 
feel the need to make as many mistakes to find these things out, 
because if you educated them well enough they wouldn't need to 
make the mistakes to learn what they need to learn. 
<P> 
I: Is there anything that the school could do to help that process 
of exploration? What can the school do or is it the responsibility 
of the school? 
<P> 
R: Be open... 
<P> 
R: They can talk honestly (#530, pp. 17-21). 
<P> 
This evidence shows a sophisticated student thought process about 
drug issues representative of most focus group interviews. These 
findings suggest that students are aware of process- related drug 
educational issues (e.g., teachers that are uncomfortable delivering 
drug education; they do not describe &quot;both sides&quot; of 
an issue/dishonesty). In fact, <B>27 percent</B> of high school 
focus groups explicitly state they want to see &quot;both sides&quot; 
of drug issues. Another <B>27 percent</B> implicitly make this 
type of statement. 
<P> 
In many situations, students did what was not often done by school 
district personnel. By talking about the evolution of their own 
development relative to drug education from elementary to high 
school, they place drug education in a developmental context. 
For them, some &quot;facts&quot; were not absorbable at the elementary 
school level, however, some were more absorbable later on. This 
data reveals evidence that, by high school, students know that 
they have taken in the facts of drug education. As previously 
shown, such facts usually focus on the harmful consequences of 
substance use. However, <B>36 percent</B> of high school focus 
groups stated that they wanted more of a continuing drug education: 
<P> 
<I><B>I: Is there anything that you guys want to say that we haven't 
asked you? Anything that you want other---you know?</B></I> 
<P> 
R: I think drug education should start younger than in the ninth 
grade. 
<P> 
I: The education did start younger, it started in elementary school. 
<P> 
R: I mean, [several voices speaking, inaudible] 
<P> 
R: Not with the policeman coming in and telling you don't do drugs. 
<P> 
I: You don't like having the... 
<P> 
R: ...start talking about the kinds of drugs and about the fact 
that it's going younger and younger. 
<P> 
R: They do that in fourth grade. I remember sitting there and 
a policeman talking about PCP and nobody knew what type. I mean, 
I remember sitting there not knowing anything that was going on, 
just sitting there, going like oh, what are these drugs. I don't 
know anything about them. 
<P> 
R: I don't think kids at that age really need to know so much... 
<P> 
R: I don't mean in elementary school, I mean in the junior high 
level when you're really curious and you're hearing all about 
it and you don't know anything except that the policeman came 
and talked to you two years ago. 
<P> 
R: When you're older it should continue (#531, p.30-31). 
<P> 
Almost all high school focus groups want a change in the processes 
of drug education. For them, a change in educational process means 
a closer connection with some experiential/affective issues of 
substances. This was made explicit in the following passage: 
<P> 
<I><B>R: He talked with technical things, like stats and statistics, 
he never talked about the emotional side of it, drug abuse or 
anything like that which I thought should have been addressed. 
I mean, because as teenagers we want---instead of knowing what 
heroin is made up of, I want to know why people need to use it, 
why they get dependent on it, is it addictive, that kind of thing, 
you know. The emotional side of it I think is really important...(#530, 
p.11).</B></I> 
<P> 
The changes in processes students wanted are best summarized by 
the following statement by this high school student: 
<P> 
<I><B>R: I just want to say that I guess the best education would 
be the education that would allow you to evaluate yourself, and 
allow you to evaluate your own personal beliefs and your morals 
and your values and take a strong look at what you're feeling, 
and how you might have the possibility to be a substance abuser 
(#530, p. 31).</B></I> 
<P> 
Three additional findings are mentioned. 18 percent of high school 
focus groups mentioned that they wanted more harm reduction programs 
(556, 544), smaller groups rather than assemblies (545, 610), 
and more counseling (531, 544). 
<P> 
In summary, students primarily expressed the desire for more content 
of drug information, including both sides of an issue, delivered 
through an educational process that includes experiential panels 
and talks by those who have been through both substance use and 
substance abuse.

<H3>Limitations and Generalizability </H3> 
 
<P> 
Because the 1992 data came from a random sample of key informants 
from the State of California, researchers can extrapolate these 
results to all California school districts. For example, among 
school district personnel, the risk orientation is prevalent in 
the State of California. The 1993 findings must be examined with 
discretion; however, the districts were purposely-reselected from 
a previously selected random sample, schools were randomly selected 
and students were purposely selected. Minimally, these results 
can be generalized to students in the state considered to be &quot;at-risk 
for substance abuse,&quot; and &quot;thriving&quot; students. 
Because there was a triangulation of the data (qualitative: between 
school district personnel and students; qualitative and quantitative: 
students' interviews and student survey results), one might assert 
that these findings could be generalized to California's students 
on the whole. 
<H3>Summary of results </H3> 
 
<OL> 
<LI>Researchers have shown that, from the formative policy language, 
a majority of school district personnel use the &quot;risk orientation&quot; 
as a guide for their DATE services. The risk orientation includes 
four factors: the perception that a majority of students are &quot;at-risk&quot; 
for substance abuse (equated with use); the equation of &quot;at-risk&quot; 
with &quot;high-risk;&quot; a mission to identify and serve these 
students; and the notable absence of discussion of protective 
factors. 
<LI>&quot;No-use&quot; policies and DATE services were implemented. 
Many specialists deliver DATE services. The most frequently reported 
services are DARE, Red Ribbon Weeks, assemblies, Health/Science 
courses, and counseling. DARE and anti-drug assemblies are most 
frequently reported at the elementary school level. Most Red Ribbon 
weeks and counseling are reported at the high school level. Health 
courses are most frequently reported in middle and high schools. 
In confirming percentages of implementation reports, these findings 
corroborate quantitative implementation findings (Romero, et al., 
1993). 
<LI>Results show no pattern of evidence supporting specialized 
services for at-risk youth. They are identified, but do not report 
receiving targeted prevention services that are any different 
from those received by &quot;thriving&quot; students. The fact 
that, despite probing, &quot;at-risk&quot; students did not generally 
discuss participating in counseling (including peer counseling) 
suggests that such services are not widely available. 
<LI>In contrast with the clear message from school district personnel 
that substance use equals abuse, students distinguish between 
substance use and abuse. Possibly because of the disparity between 
the experiences students describe and the drug education services 
they receive, as school level increases, perceived credibility 
of service deliverers decreases. 
<LI>Both adults and students questioned the value of policies 
which purge those most in need of help from the educational system. 
 
<LI>Quantitative student survey results show that a high percentage 
of students are not influenced by DATE services, or service deliverers, 
have a neutral-to-negative affect toward such service deliverers, 
and take responsibility for their substance use decisions. 
<LI>Students expressed a desire for more complete drug information, 
delivered through a different educational process, including frank 
and confidential discussion. This includes panels and talks by 
those who have been through both substance use and substance abuse. 
 
</OL> 
 
<H3>Discussion </H3> 
 
<P> 
No single finding adequately paints the picture of the effects 
of DATE upon students. However, each successive piece of evidence 
builds a compelling picture. With high levels of reported implementation, 
both the qualitative and quantitative results support a general 
lack of DATE Program efficacy. This is most evident during the 
period in which adolescents are most likely to be making substance 
use decisions, at the middle and high school levels. For many 
students, there appears a negative affect toward school district 
personnel and the DATE services they deliver. There exists a significant 
mismatch in the difference between how many school district personnel 
deliver programs, and how students want them to be delivered. 
<P> 
There is a possible alternative interpretation for these results. 
The results do show that a small percentage of students have been 
positively influenced by the DATE Program. Some students do feel 
that these services are worthwhile, describing that the adults 
around them do care. However, this information is so limited in 
scope that it could not be considered representative of the entire 
data set. Furthermore, researchers note that those students who 
are most likely to be positively affected by DATE also already 
describe themselves as active participants in the school community 
(i.e., those who would be most likely to be positively affected 
in the first place). Consequently, while this alternative interpretation 
is important, it does not address the issues of many or possibly 
most other students, who may not be active in the school community, 
or are on the periphery of the school community (at-risk students). 
<P> 
When considering the student perspective as a set, it is difficult 
to escape the conclusion that the school districts' use of the 
risk-based model of substance use and abuse does not help many 
students. Evidence suggests that the programs cause a significant 
degree of psychological dissonance, increasing by grade level. 
Most critical to the efficacy of the risk factor model is the 
exclusion of those perceived by both students and district personnel 
as needing help. 
<P> 
Relative to prevention science literature, school district personnel 
were well informed in citing risk factors; that is, in selecting 
&quot;at-risk&quot; students, they used risk characteristics based 
in prevention science. However, what they demonstrated in practice 
was that, by using such wide ranging characteristics, they were 
able to place &quot;a majority&quot; of students in this category. 
As we have seen, this has serious implications, best described 
by Baizerman and Compton (1992). When discussing the resultant 
processes of identification of &quot;at-risk&quot; youth, they 
state: 
<P> 
In many schools, this process results in the majority of students 
being identified as at-risk. This is hardly surprising, since 
the educational use of the term &quot;at-risk&quot; does not meet 
the test of the public health definition---that is, it is not 
known whether the characteristics used for identification actually 
predict which students are most likely to drop out of school...Whole 
schools and even districts are not thought of as being at-risk; 
the problem and its sources are the students (pp. 8-9). 
<P> 
Our evidence supports Baizerman and Comptons' research and takes 
it a step further. Students at all grades are sensitive to the 
practices of school authorities. According to them, school drug 
policies are used more as a tool for &quot;getting rid of the 
bad kids&quot; than really providing help to potential substance 
abusers. By middle school, these students report that courses 
teaching &quot;harmful consequences&quot; and &quot;use equals 
abuse&quot; combined with exclusionary practices (detention, suspension, 
expulsion) appear to have three effects. DATE programs: 
<OL> 
<LI>Result in developmentally inappropriate programs, which in 
turn, result in increasing sources of unnecessary dissonance for 
many students. 
<LI>Undermine the school personnel's credibility by giving students 
only one perspective, which students perceive as biased. 
<LI>Help create policies that exclude those whom students themselves 
recognize as most in need of help; they drive those, who already 
might be on the margins of the school system further out. 
</OL> 
 
<P> 
These findings must be further explored in larger studies with 
more student interviews. Nevertheless, researchers found that 
students, especially adolescents, used behaviors to define substance 
use as experimental or abusive and took responsibility for their 
substance use decisions (found in qualitative and quantitative 
results). Regarding the latter, taking responsibility for their 
decisions, one could argue that study results may be due to adolescents 
overestimating their own decision-making power; simultaneously, 
students may have underestimated the possible influences of DATE 
services and/or service deliverers. However, the research of Quandrel 
et al., (1993) shows that adolescents are, in fact, reasonably 
able to evaluate risks associated with their own lives, making 
decisions accordingly. In this case, evaluating the risk of substance 
&quot;use&quot; or &quot;abuse&quot; includes the extent to which 
DATE services and service deliverers provide information that 
influences their substance use decisions. Given that some of the 
strongest evidence in this study confirms other well-conducted 
research, it helps validate the sophistication and accuracy of 
students' attributions regarding how they make decisions about 
substance use, and the extent to which they are influenced by 
service deliverers. 
<P> 
Regarding the former, (distinguishing between substance use and 
abuse), compared with experimentation, we found that even the 
youngest students recognize a substance abuse problem. At the 
same time, of experimental use, Newcomb and Bentler found that: 
 
<P> 
In fact, experimental use of various types of drugs, both licit 
and illicit, may be considered a normative behavior among contemporary 
U.S. teenagers (1988, p.214). 
<P> 
Commensurate with this research, the results of the present study 
show that, while the policies and messages of &quot;no-use&quot; 
may be highly visible and publicly reassuring, even the youngest 
students are telling us that if we do not acknowledge societal 
norms and rites of adolescent passage, such policies and programs 
may be ineffective. These ideas become especially salient when 
looking at protective factor research that shows bonding to any 
significant adult can help even the most &quot;at-risk&quot; students 
become positive decision-makers (Werner, 1986). These precepts 
were absent in the service deliverer data, but present in student 
data: 
<P> 
<I><B>R: They have like this guy, he had been through a lot and 
he came to the school. He talked to everybody like they were his 
family or something! And a lot of people responded to that. And 
they went up and talked to him after or talked to him on the phone; 
they talked to him.</B></I> 
<P> 
I: He really touched students? 
<P> 
R: Yeah! [in unison] And some students dig that and some students 
believe that the guy was just conning, just not serious. But, 
he seemed normal. 
<P> 
I: What do you guys think? What could the school do to help kids? 
<P> 
R: Yeah. I think that the teachers that have no, teachers that 
are young, there's this one English teacher and he's young, and 
I think kids look up to him, kinda. So, I think he's an influence 
in that. So maybe the kids talk to him more... 
<P> 
I: They trust him more? 
<P> 
R: Yeah. Cause he's funny and not like, do this and do this! The 
kids like him and they look up to him (#545, pp. 17-18). 
<P> 
In the current school-based drug education process, schools may 
be seen as a vehicle to change widespread social norms, overlooking 
the effects of popular culture, family experience, and cultural 
differences. 
<P> 
To understand these results, they must be placed in a social and 
historical context. For example, in the 1970's and early 80's 
there were attempts to understand and educate students on the 
differences between substance use and abuse (NIDA, 1981). Adolescent 
substance experimentation, while not promoted, was seen somewhat 
as a dialectic of growth (Jessor and Jessor, 1977). However, in 
the middle 1980's, researchers and policy-makers alike shifted 
their perception of adolescents (Brown and Horowitz, 1993). The 
new view of adolescents became one of deviants in need of help. 
This was depicted through evidence from correlational research 
built on the relationship between any substance use and delinquency 
(Hawkins et al., 1987). This research would come to provide the 
undergirding for our national drug control strategy that stated: 
<P> 
School-based prevention programs should be reinforced by tough, 
but fair policies on use, possession, and distribution of drugs...We 
cannot teach them that drugs are wrong and harmful if we fail 
to follow up our teaching with real consequences for those who 
use them...Policies like these have been criticized for addition 
to the dropout problem. But experience shows that firm policies 
fairly enforced actually reduce the numbers of students who must 
be expelled for drug violations; most students choose to alter 
their behavior rather than risk expulsion (The White House, 1989, 
p.50-51). 
<P> 
Unfortunately, these policies were based on incorrect premises. 
In fact, the National High School Survey results reveal that student-reported 
alcohol and tobacco use has remained stable over the last few 
years at around 87 percent (alcohol use) and 61 percent (tobacco), 
with marijuana use rising to over 35 percent (Johnston et al.,1993). 
There is no evidence that &quot;most students choose to alter 
their behavior rather than risk expulsion.&quot; This is particularly 
true for &quot;at-risk&quot; students, many of whom report being 
alienated from the school community. This evidence suggests that 
DATE promoted a &quot;get tough&quot; view of dealing with students 
supported by a prevention science that illuminated a deviant view 
of them. The &quot;get tough&quot; view was to detain, suspend, 
or expel those demonstrating substance using behaviors. All students, 
including those &quot;at-risk for substance abuse,&quot; receive 
only a &quot;no-use&quot; message, which appears to result in 
decreased perception of service deliverers' credibility. From 
this, an interesting paradox arises. DATE provided monies to help 
students in need, but they describe being excluded; many of those 
not excluded describe looking elsewhere for credible drug information. 
<P> 
Over the last 20 years, there has been no consistent evidence 
that programs, such as those discussed, prevent either substance 
use or substance abuse (Klitzner, 1987; Moscowitz, 1989). However, 
because of the approach toward adolescents, this study shows what 
has been previously postulated: that such programs can do harm 
to adolescents (Baizerman and Compton 1992). Based on new funding, 
DATE Programs were expected to be part of a new breed of drug 
education. Instead, the focus of most of these programs-to teach 
the harmful consequences of substance use-is more than twenty 
years old (Brown and Horowitz, 1993). DATE service coverage is 
staged in two ways: #(1) augmenting existing programs by #(2) 
bringing in specialists who promote a &quot;no-use&quot; message. 
At the same time, during this period of educational cutbacks, 
drug dollars are desirable. Consequently, older mass application 
services, often involving specialists, are delivered. Researchers 
posit that such services are favored because they are efficient; 
they are well practiced by specialists, and can be delivered through 
one-time or relatively limited programming. However, such services 
often occur at the expense of the counseling support needed by 
our most troubled students. In light of increasing evidence that 
current policy and program directions are ineffective, it is time 
to reexamine certain drug educational and policy directions. 
<P> 
If we are really going to positively affect our adolescents, then 
substance use education policies and programs must be shaped in 
accordance with students' levels of sophistication. This is not 
to argue for promoting substance use. Rather, it is to argue for 
the end of labeling, for being &quot;at-risk for substance abuse&quot; 
which, as we have seen, has detrimental effects. <B>This evidence 
suggests that performing more of the same, (e.g., harmful consequence 
educational &quot;booster&quot; sessions, and harsher drug policies) 
will not work. </B>In fact, from a social psychological perspective, 
the mere necessity of booster sessions (i.e. ongoing attempts 
at influencing students toward abstention), may tacitly indicate 
service inefficacy. If influence is internalized by students (i.e. 
if they decide not to use substances as result of prevention programming), 
then evidence suggests they need not be continually reinforced 
(Raven, 1965, 1992). 
<P> 
Based on this study's findings and available research we make 
the following recommendations: 
<OL> 
<LI><B>Provide a developmentally appropriate set of prevention 
programs at all grade levels.</B> 
<LI><B>Discontinue primarily harmful consequences educational 
services.<BR> 
</B>Even though many students can display the rote knowledge that 
any substance use is unhealthy, at the same time, during early 
grades, students show little or no evidence of understanding harmful 
consequences information. Elementary- level students showed, and 
high school students retrospectively stated, that when they were 
in elementary school, they did not understand the meaning of, 
for example, the harmful consequences that the DARE officer spoke 
of. Although young children's perceptions are sophisticated, they 
must be more linked with experiences; namely, seeing adults using 
substances reasonably, as well as hearing about or seeing adults 
with substance abuse problems. If not, as we saw, it is during 
this period that an initial credibility gap becomes evident. At 
the same time, evidence clearly shows that by middle and high 
schools, programs like DARE, Red Ribbon Weeks, and Health/Science 
courses containing the primarily harmful consequences of use are 
far too simplistic for sophisticated student perceptions. These 
students demonstrated a significant ability to portray many sides 
of drug issues based on types, levels, and social contexts under 
which substances are used. 
<LI><B>Without condoning substance use, shift to a harm reduction 
approach similar to that used when delivering AIDS Education. 
<BR> 
</B>Students' awareness of making decisions about the use of substances 
was presented in their &quot;responses to the instructional strategies&quot; 
section. Evidence from school district personnel and students 
at each school level showed that students believed they were being 
presented with only one correct decision: a decision not to use 
substances. While legally this is correct (e.g., it is illegal 
for minors to use substances), programmatically, students describe 
this approach as a cornerstone of failure. Regarding AIDS, educators 
have been able to increase programmatic success because they did 
not promote sexuality, but recognized with students that sexuality 
occurs, and shifted toward reducing the potentially deadly consequences 
resulting from sexual practices (e.g., from having unprotected 
sex).<BR> 
A majority of negative consequences from substance use results 
from acts related to substance use, (e.g., drinking and then driving). 
Without in any way sanctioning substance use, it is prudent to 
shift toward a harm-reduction approach; meant to deal realistically 
and credibly with specific issues associated with substance use. 
This shift is the only remaining educational alternative with 
substantial research support (Newcomb and Bentler 1988; Shedler 
and Block, 1990; Brown and Horowitz, 1993). Such an approach would 
include six items, enumerated by O'Hare et al., (1988 and 1992): 
<OL> 
<LI>Provide young people with factual information about drugs. 
<LI>Help them to examine their own attitudes about drugs and drug 
users. 
<LI>Help them to understand people who experience drug problems 
and foster a caring attitude. 
<LI>Help them to avoid the harmful consequences of drug use by 
explaining secondary prevention strategies. 
<LI>Raise awareness of the legal, health, and social implications 
of their own drug use. 
<LI>Help them to understand the role of drug use in past and present 
societies and cultures. 
</OL> 
 
<LI><B>Recruit outside drug educators to provide confidential 
educational services.<BR> 
</B>Evident throughout the student data is desire of the students' 
to speak openly and confidentially with specialists. While specialists 
with an official capacity, such as DARE officers, were brought 
in by middle and high schools, they were often ridiculed. Most 
often, students wanted to discuss their drug experiences with 
knowledgeable individuals with whom they could be candid. This 
evidence suggests it would be fruitful to recruit outside professionals 
competent to answer student questions about substances in an interactive 
and confidential teaching situation.<BR> 
 
<LI>If &quot;at&quot; and &quot;high&quot; risk youth cannot be 
fully assisted, discontinue use of the model.<BR> 
Findings revealed that a substantial portion of the DATE Program 
was targeted toward &quot;at-risk&quot; risk youth. At the same 
time, students thus designated have reported receiving services 
that were no different from those received by other students. 
Some may argue that the risk factor model was never fully implemented 
as intended and that, therefore, DATE is not a valid test of the 
model. We disagree. Given the policy transfer of the model from 
state to school, and the use of risk factors to identify students 
&quot;at risk for substance abuse,&quot; DATE stands as one of 
the largest scale attempts to implement this model. It has failed 
for two reasons: First, <B>in California schools, the risk factor 
model is misused as an individual diagnostic tool. </B>Before 
researchers ever asked principals to identify individual &quot;at-risk&quot; 
students, 1992 results showed that school district personnel used 
risk factors to identify students who were &quot;at risk for substance 
abuse.&quot; Prevention science risk factors may be related to 
populations of students (Coie et al., 1993; Hawkins et al., 1992), 
but there is little evidence that they predict substance &quot;abuse&quot; 
in individual students (Brown and Horowitz, 1993; Fine, 1993). 
Moreover, protective factor research shows that most &quot;at 
risk&quot; adolescents do not go on to become substance &quot;abusers&quot; 
(Werner, 1986). Second, <B>the model is inherently difficult to 
implement</B>. Our evidence suggests that, while the practice 
to identify such students occurred, it seemed beyond the resources 
of many schools to provide individualized services. If assistance 
for those designated as &quot;at&quot; or &quot;high&quot; risk 
is not forthcoming, then the process of identification in and 
of itself, has negative repercussions (Richardson, 1990; Rossi, 
1994). This is because students are identified, but the resources 
do not appear to be available for them to be served. As a consequence, 
the use of this model should be discontinued.<BR> 
 
<LI>Do not purge students in need of help from the educational 
system. <BR> 
 
<LI>7. Bolster counseling services<BR> 
Although school district personnel believe that &quot;no use&quot; 
policies must be strictly enforced, they appear to be a key aspect 
of students' understanding of drug education. Students often tied 
the detention, suspension, and expulsion of their peers to a general 
lack of DATE service efficacy. To positively affect students of 
all kinds, many school district personnel and students argue for 
helping those that truly need help. Either exclusionary policies 
should be replaced with policies that support adolescents who 
truly have abuse problems through the availability of confidential 
counseling, or personnel should refrain from using the threat 
of detention, suspension, and expulsion as a substance use deterrent. 
Aside from traditional one-on-one student counseling, here, counseling 
is seen as including support groups led by professional counselors, 
and student assistance programming. This argument can best be 
heard in the voice of a school district respondent: <BR> 
<I><B>R: We still get rid of too many kids...those are the kids 
that the State of California and the United States of America 
have identified as their target population...the kids that are 
at risk the most are the kids that are exited from the system, 
and they do not have access to the resources...The kids that we 
need to keep in and provide resources to are the kids that we 
exit from the system (#558, p.18).</B></I> 
</OL> 
 
<H3>Epilogue </H3> 
 
<P> 
We recognize that the findings from this study may cause significant 
concern to interested parties. However, the methods, findings, 
discussion, and recommendations represent a valid and reliable 
consensus of meaning from the social world of school district 
personnel and students. This evidence, combined with well-founded 
educational, social welfare, public health, and social-psychological 
evidence, places recommendations on firm ground. Given current 
results, research literature, and historical context, the changes 
requested by students must be construed as the only remaining, 
legitimate way to improve school-based drug education. In the 
course of understanding the educational development and implementation 
practices of school district personnel, students exposed three 
myths that need to be dispelled: 
<OL> 
<LI><B>Adolescents are naive: On the contrary, they are sophisticated 
individuals capable of making sophisticated decisions</B> (Jessor 
and Jessor, 1977; Newcomb and Bentler, 1988; McIntyre et al., 
1989; Moore and Saunders, 1991; Quandrel et al.,1993). 
<LI><B>Any adolescent substance use is deviant: Putting legalities 
and politics aside, because they may experiment with substances, 
adolescents are not inherently deviant </B>(Jessor and Jessor, 
1977; Newcomb and Bentler, 1988; Shedler and Block, 1990). 
<LI><B>Most adolescents go on to become substance &quot;abusers:&quot; 
In fact, up to 70 percent of students in the highest risk conditions 
do not go on to become substance abusers </B>(Werner, 1986; Brown 
and Horowitz, 1993). Additionally, like many adults, there are 
many &quot;thriving&quot; adolescents who drink and may use substances, 
and are contributing members to their school communities. 
</OL> 
 
<P> 
Again, we are not condoning adolescent substance use; nevertheless, 
adolescent substance using behaviors exist. In conclusion, the 
alternative--judging student behaviors based on these myths-- 
has been tried, and schools have paid a high price. This research 
necessitates a well-founded shift in both the fundamental assumptions 
and the processes found in California's school-based drug education.

<H3>Appendix 3: An Alternative View to the Risk Orientation </H3> 
 
<P> 
In accordance with the alternative to the risk orientation, the 
view of student substance depends on the culture of the student, 
the substance used, and the social context of use. When asked 
about the programs in their school district, this respondent says: 
<P> 
<I><B>R: I really think it's essential that, in this particular 
area, especially with drug, alcohol, and so forth, we want to 
make sure that whatever we are going to say to your youngsters, 
with regards to that curriculum, that it doesn't violate any cultural 
norm that's out there, that we may be aware of. There may be a 
set of norms operating out there that a - I have to back up a 
little bit. I'm just going to generalize for a second. As a WASP 
teacher, working in a non&#173;WASP environment, I may not be 
conscious of the fact that whatever I'm saying may be contrary 
to an ethnic or cultural norm out there. For instance, in some 
households it's perfectly acceptable for a young person to have 
a half a tumbler or a couple of ounces of wine with their dinner. 
It could be diluted and so forth, should we say that is bad, as 
a classroom teacher?</B></I> 
<P> 
I: That is a very interesting question. How would you answer that? 
<P> 
R: I did work in that kind of an environment and who am I to argue 
with a first generation Italian family or French family or any 
family, for that matter, that says wine to a hard daily diet is 
like milk to most Americans. So, I would say, we necessarily have 
to take that into account. We shouldn't say that is evil and don't 
do it. I think the institution has to be flexible enough to say 
to students, this is what happened in terms of prolonged use of 
alcohol, especially when it's abusing that particular substance. 
However, we do understand that if I was teaching in Marseilles 
or if I was teaching in Milan, that as a French teacher or as 
an Italian teacher, I wouldn't make a big deal out of it because 
I know and it's perfectly acceptable for young people, age 10 
or 11, to have a couple of ounces of wine with their dinner. It's 
a cultural norm (#298, pp. 12&#173;13)<B>.</B> 
<P> 
Notably absent from this passage is discussion of &quot;at-risk&quot; 
students. Furthermore, the respondent goes to great lengths to 
describe a &quot;cultural norm&quot; in which he questions, &quot;Who 
am I to argue with a first generation Italian family or French 
family or any family, for that matter, that says wine to a hard 
daily diet is like milk to most Americans?&quot; From this perspective, 
the DATE Program should take into account the multicultural environment 
of the student and the conditions of substance use. This approach 
is not described in the DATE application. 
<P> 
Notably absent from this data are the three elements that constitute 
the risk orientation: First, respondents providing this alternative 
context for the delivery of DATE show an absence of verbal statements 
characteristic of the most commonly held view of risk. Second, 
there is an absence both of the association of a majority of students 
with risk and the equation of substance use with substance abuse. 
Finally, there is an absence of the desire to identify those at 
risk.

<b>Abstract--</b>The institution of methadone maintenance as a treatment modality for heroin
addiction in the mid-1960s was part of the growing medicalization of social problems in the
United States.The definition of deviance as "sickness" rather than "badness" set the stage for
America's first harm-reduction strategy.By the 1970s methadone maintenance was seen as a
way to reduce drug-related crime, and federally funded programs proliferated.Accompanying
methadone's phenomenal expansion was increased regulation, bureaucratization, and criticism. 
The early 1980s brought the Reagan era, fiscal austerity, the new "just say no" abstinence
morality, and demedicalization of methadone maintenance.By the time needle-sharing was
recognized as a major contributing factor in the spread of HIV, methadone had been transformed
into a largely fee-for-service, short-term, begrudgingly tolerated treatment modality.Ironically,
while other countries were able to use methadone to curb the spread of AIDS, the United States
refused to facilitate its expansion, and in fact impeded it.To the frustration of proponents and
consumers, this original harm-reduction tool, with the potential to impact the epidemic, was
demedicalized and remains marginalized.</blockquote>

<p>The institution of methadone maintenance treatment in the United States represented a
culmination of the increased medicalization of social problems in American society during the
first half of the twentieth century.Drug technologies had been developed that would alleviate all
forms of pain, which had been defined by Americans as uniformly intolerable (Illich 1976). 
During the 1950s deviant behavior was redefined not as "badness" but as disease, and addiction
was redefined as an illness that could be treated with advancing medical technologies (Conrad &
Schneider 1980).The rehabilitative ideal became the dominating solution to the crime problem,
as thousands of offenders were reformed in a myriad of programs (American Friends Service
Committee 1971). 
<p>In the mid-1960s, Drs. Vincent Dole and Marie Nyswander began to report on their initial
findings in their research with methadone maintenance treatment (Dole & Nyswander 1965). 
Their findings constitute the basic ideology behind the proliferation of methadone maintenance:
methadone could relieve the metabolic disorder created by opiate addiction, and with doses high
enough to block the physical craving for heroin, the individual would be immune to its euphoric
effects.Thus, methadone users would be in a favorable position to break their ties with heroin
and go on to become productive members of society.As such, methadone maintenance was the
original form of drug harm reduction in the United States. 
<p>Although the findings of outcome of the early proponents of methadone were tentative, "the
media immediately heralded it as the long-awaited 'medical breakthrough,' labeling methadone a
'Cinderella drug' which could be economically applied to hundreds of thousands of addicts, and,
in short order, solve the narcotics problem" (Newman 1977:xix).With the methadone
breakthrough, heroin addiction was further defined as a medical (as opposed to a social) problem,
and the addict became a patient. 
<p>Having transformed heroin addiction into a treatable disease, and with proclamations about
its salvation to society and the addict alike, methadone maintenance spread.Programs began to
open officially in 1963 with Dole and Nyswander's original two patients.In March of 1965, the
expanded program moved into an open ward of Beth Israel Hospital (in New York City), with six
patients; by 1968 there were 1,139 patients.
<p>In the 1970s and 1980s, methadone providers and patients struggled with definition,
implementation, and ultimately survival.This article looks at the first two decades of methadone
treatment.During the 1970s the use of methadone expanded greatly.In the early 1980s, the
Reagan morality and fiscal austerity created a treatment method that was viewed largely as
containment of the addict population.Finally, in the post-AIDS late 1980s methadone became
almost fully demedicalized, precisely at a time when medical treatment was needed most. 
<p> 
<b>THE 1970s: METHADONE EXPANDS<br> 
AND COMES UNDER ATTACK</b> 
 
<p>In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the use of methadone expanded rapidly.The spirit of
rehabilitation laid the foundation for the growth of the treatment of deviant behavior, including
drug abuse, using the medical model.Three other variables entered into the picture that made
more efficient control of drug abuse seem imperative.First, crime statistics indicated that the
growing crime rate could be accounted for in large part by drugs and drug-related activities.It
was heroin addicts who were to blame for much of the burglary and petty theft that had reached
epidemic proportions.Second, widespread drug addiction in Vietnam servicemen, who were
becoming veterans, was alarming.Finally, the growing use of illicit substances (though,
paradoxically, not opioids) by middle-class, White youths (who saw themselves as part of the
"hippie" movement) redefined drug abuse as having reached epidemic proportions.Conrad and
Schneider (1980:135) noted that "the late '60s and early '70s marked a rise in public concern with
'the drug problem,' especially heroin addiction.Writers in the professional and popular media
were declaring a virtual 'heroin addiction epidemic' in America."
<p>By 1972, drug abuse was proclaimed "the major domestic crisis facing the nation " by the
president of the United States (Nixon 1972).In the spirit of crisis with which Nixon
characterized the drug problem, treatment in various forms proliferated: the drug-free therapeutic
community, outpatient detoxification, and methadone maintenance. 
<p>By 1971 the estimated number of methadone patients nationwide had jumped to 25,000
(Brecher 1972).Accompanying this expansion was increased criticism, regulation, and
bureaucratization.Perhaps topping the list of criticisms was that maintenance was the equivalent
of substituting one drug for another, and patients "never got off." Ironically, methadone was
initially attractive because it was an opioid substitute, and maintenance was recommended for
this chronic relapsing condition.Methadone also came under attack due to diversion of the drug. 
This was another ironic criticism, since the diverted methadone was going largely to heroin
addicts and other methadone patients.The idea that novices would become addicted to their first
opioid through diverted methadone (on the schoolyard) proved completely unfounded.Even
patients criticized methadone, claiming that "it takes your heart' (Hunt et al. 1985), that it had a
host of side effects (Rosenbaum & Murphy 1987); and that it tied them to the clinic (Rosenbaum
1981).Despite the criticism, extensive research continually found that methadone was
expedient.It worked to reduce drug related criminality in patients and stabilized their drug
habits.In short, as one of the early study participants stated, "methadone removes the issue of
drugs from my life." 
<p>In response to methadone's criticisms came the "regulatory counterattack" in 1973 (Dole, as
cited in Courtwright, Joseph & Des Jarlais 1989).Indeed, clinics had to comply with a complex
set of rules governing admission to treatment, attendance, dose level, take-home doses,
urinalysis, and record-keeping methods.If they did not comply with "the regs," they were out of
business.From the perspective of clinic staff as well as patients, this hardly felt like traditional
delivery of medical services.It became clear that the proliferation of clinics in the 1970s had
much more to do with stopping crime than the well-being of heroin addicts.Indeed, increased
regulation moved methadone further away from a purely medical treatment.As Zweben and
Payte (1990:594) commented: "Programs quickly learned that survival depended on the
condition of the records and not the patients....There has been considerable speculation as to the
motivation or purpose for the regulations that represented an unprecedented intrusion into the
practice of medicine.Some think there was a sincere intention to ensure quality care, others that
the process was one of political compromise, and still others that the intention was to discourage
the growth of this unpopular form of treatment.Evidently some provisions were made in the
absence or disregard of scientific clinical investigations and experience."<p>

The New Morality and fiscal austerity of the Reagan administration had major implications for
methadone treatment.Nancy Reagan's "Just Say No" campaign and the emphasis on zero
tolerance of illegal drugs ushered in an era (extending to the present) in which abstinence was
seen as the only viable perspective and form of drug abuse treatment. 
<p>The fiscal austerity of the early 1980s meant a general scaling back, and often the
elimination, of social programs that had been instituted in the 1960s and 1970s.Funding for
methadone maintenance programs began to dry up, experiencing a 30% decline between 1976
and 1987 (Gerstein & Harwood 1990).As a result private, fee-for-service clinics proliferated. 
<p>The original definitions of the nature of methadone maintenance treatment were further
compromised in an effort to cut costs.If there were to be time limits in treatment, a new
ideology had to be constructed.Hence there was a shift in protocol from lifelong to time-limited
treatment.Methadone was seen as a means to an abstinent end rather than an end in itself. 
<p>The message was clear: methadone would be begrudgingly tolerated.The government
would no longer pay for it, however; nor would they allow a methadone user to remain in a
program indefinitely.This message led to a further demedicalization (what other medical
regimen has a built-in time limit?) and increased demoralization of treatment staff as well as
patients.Clinic staff were unable to act as medical personnel.With payment of fees and the
movement away from a medical definition of addiction, the nomenclature changed."Patients"
were increasingly called "clients" in an effort to upgrade their status as consumers.A well- 
meaning gesture, it was hollow and ultimately counterproducdve.None of the regulations
changed that would empower clients, and they had gained no increases in decision making vis-a- 
vis their own treatment.However, the shift in titles had the negative effect of moving methadone
treatment even further away from the practice of medicine.As Kahn (1992:282) remarked: "It is
common for counselors to interchange the terms 'client' and 'patient'. . . . This may inadvertently
contribute to negative perceptions.The term 'patient' refers to someone manifesting an illness
requiring expert care, and is more consistent with efforts to counteract the view of the heroin
addict as a criminal with character defects" 
<p>By the mid-1980s methadone had moved, essentially, from a medical treatment to the
containment of addicts, just as the criminal justice system had moved from rehabilitation to
containment of "the rabble" (Irwin 1985).Methadone treatment was infused with the Reagan
(abstinence) morality: dose levels were restricted despite evidence that treatment was more
effective at higher levels (Ball & Ross 1991; Caplehorn & Bell 1991; Hargreaves 1983); time in
treatment was limited despite research findings insisting that longer treatment stays produced
better results (Hubbard et al. 1989; Simpson & Sells 1982; Cushman 1981; McGlothlin & Anglin
1981; Simpson 1981, 1979; Dole & Joseph 1978; Stimmel et al. 1978), and private fees were
instituted despite evidence that addicts needing methadone could not afford to pay for it
(Rosenbaum, Murphy & Beck 1987).Just as with other programs for the poor, the message was
clear:it was no longer acceptable for lower-class people and their problems to be subsidized by
the government.<p> 
 
<b>THE MID-1980s: ENTER AIDS</b> 
 
<p>In the mid-1980s it was discovered that HIV could be and was being transmitted through
blood by the sharing of injection equipment.Intravenous (IV) drug users became the second
largest group to be infected by HIV, which causes AIDS, and their numbers were growing
quickly.It became obvious that a key method to stop the spread of the virus through drug users
was to (1) educate IV drug users to clean their injection equipment, (2) use clean needles, or (3)
stop using needles.Regarding the latter, methadone maintenance was seen as an already-in-place
method to accomplish the cessation of needle use.Indeed, methadone maintenance clients have
demonstrated a lower seroprevalence rate (Siddiqui et al. 1993; Novick, Joseph & Croxson 1990;
Weber et al. 1990; Hartel, Selwyn & Schoenbaum 1988; Abdul-Quadar et al. 1987).When
countries all over the world expanded programs in an effort to slow the spread of AIDS, stubborn
morality and fiscal shortsightedness prevented the United States from utilizing methadone
maintenance as a harm-reduction strategy (Nadelmann et al. 1994). 
<p>There was an effort by providers to reinstitute the original definition of addiction as a disease
that would require lifelong treatment.This effort was consistent with the "recovery" movement
of the late 1980s, in which everything from alcohol problems to food abuse to gambling to
relationship dependency was defined as a disease (Peele 1989).Whereas medicalization has
proliferated in the form of defining so many problems and habits as diseases, the most popular
solution has been the 12-Step programs.However, methadone maintenance, though a tried form
of treatment for one of the oldest acknowledged diseases, has been systematically excluded as a
viable option because its ultimate goal is not abstinence.Pragmatism, once again, was cast aside
for morality. 
<p>Funding was cut, and although providers begged for increased client access to maintenance,
the continuation of defunding made methadone inaccessible at $350 per month to the very people
who needed it most (Rosenbaum, Murphy & Beck 1987). 
<p> 
<b>MORALITY FRUSTRATES AMERICA'S<br> 
FIRST HARM-REDUCTION EFFORT</b> 
 
<p>The War on Drugs initiated by the Reagan administration in the 1980s has Americans even
more conflicted and inconsistent about drugs than ever.Even in the face of the AIDS epidemic,
harm-reduction efforts-such as needle exchange, marijuana for the relief of nausea associated
with AIDS and chemotherapy, and methadone for cessation of needle use-have been met with a
stubborn moralistic resistance.Despite extensive research demonstrating its efficacy, as well as
its legal status, methadone has been treated as an illicit drug and caught in a moral rather than
medical debate (Newman & Peyser 1991:120): "The reality is that those who reject methadone
treatment have been unresponsive to intuition, empiricism, pragmatism, and scientific data.The
reason seems clear ... the controversies over methadone treatment stem almost entirely from
philosophical differences-objections to the substitution of one drug for another-and not from
doubts about the pharmacological safety and efficacy of methadone. . ." 
<p>Methadone maintenance has been a frustrating experience for nearly everyone concerned
with it: clinic staff, clients themselves, and researchers.Staff physicians and counselors in
methadone programs consistently express exasperation at attempting to treat a medical problem
with extensive regulatory mechanisms that more often than not interfere with sound medical
treatment (Payte 199 1; Zweben & Payte 1990).It is also difficult to practice medicine with the
stigma attached to methadone, since that stigma ultimately extends not only to clients, but clinic
staff as well.As Newman said (as cited in Kahn 1992): "There is no other medication
(methadone) ... that physicians rely on for which maximum dosages have been decreed....
Physicians in no other medical practice are constrained by law from treating more than a
designated number of patients....." For this reason, some physicians have simply abandoned
methadone treatment (Payte 1991). 
<p>Methadone users have been victims of the political and social maneuvering of the past 20
years.Initially they expected a medical treatment that would allow them to function without
having to procure an illegal drug (heroin) on a daily basis in order to feel normal.With the
introduction of extensive regulations they found that being on methadone was no picnic
(Rosenbaum In press; Rosenblum, Magura & Joseph 1991).Methadone users also felt
stigmatized by the negative definitions of maintenance (Rosenbaum In press; Murphy & Irwin
1992).They were in a perpetual state of identity "limbo." Ultimately, their real-life struggles are
the most frustrating (Rosenbaum, Irwin & Murphy 1988).The conditions experienced by clients
have been exasperated by the demedicalization of methadone treatment and its progressive
marginalization. 
<p>Finally, those in the field of treatment research have learned that sometimes policy has little
to do with science.Research findings largely in support of methadone maintenance as an
effective harm-reduction treatment are widely acknowledged in the drug abuse field.The
National Institute on Drug Abuse, now a part of the National Institutes of Health, has funded
methadone research for over two decades, and instituted policy consistent with the findings of
their grantees.Nonetheless, to add to the frustration of researchers, state and federal
bureaucracies often ignore such policy positions.Instead, they opt for cost-cutting, politically
expedient, but ultimately counterproductive means for dealing with drug abuse. 
<p>Perhaps, with increasing international adoption of harm-reduction strategies and a shift in
focus from a criminal justice to a public health view of drug use, methadone maintenance will
become remedicalized in the United States.Some providers believe methadone maintenance has
been reintroduced and is already becoming less marginalized because of the AIDS epidemic
(Zweben & Sorenson 1988).Perhaps the Clinton administration's new drug control strategy
emphasizing prevention and treatment will mean that methadone can once again be used as it
was designed by Drs. Dole and Nyswander: as a medical tool to reduce the harms of addiction
and abuse.<p>

<b>NOTES</b> 
<p>
<ol> 
<li><a name="note1"></a>Despite its growth and seeming acceptance, there was trouble early on for 
methadone maintenance.A 1919 amendment to the Harrison Act allowed physicians to prescribe 
narcotics
only for legitimate medical purposes.Since addiction was not seen as a legitimate disease, the
prescription of drugs for maintenance purposes was not allowed (Joseph & Appel 1993).In this
instance, precedence was set for the reticence to endorse and then support maintenance treatment. <a

<li><a name="note2"></a>Although it was believed there was a heroin epidemic, some argued that it was 
actually
manufactured by the reaction to increasing marijuana use by "counterculture" types, such as
hippies, leftist and other dissidents, including the Black Power movement (Lidz, Walker &
Gould 1980).The proliferation of programs to "help" addicts and stepped up law enforcement
created statistics that after-the-fact proved there was an epidemic.Numbers of people in
treatment and arrests had increased drastically. <a href="#back2">(Back)</a>

<h3><center>Drug Prevention Placebo: How DARE Wastes Time, Money, and 
Police</center></h3> <p>  
<font size=2><i>Elliot, Jeff. "Drug Prevention Placebo: How DARE <br>  
Wastes Time, Money, and Police."<b>Reason</b> Mar. 1995: 14-21.</i></font size><hr> 
 
<p>The October 1994 government flyer seemed like sweet vindication to the thousands 
of parents, police, and teachers who supported the Drug Abuse Resistance Education 
Program, better known by the acronym DARE. "The D.A.R.E. Program: A Review of 
Prevalence, User Satisfaction, and Effectiveness," the headline on the single page 
boasted, describing a new study of the drug-education program. More happy news 
followed. "Not only is DARE widespread and popular, but demand for it is high," read 
the flyer. DARE's "...appeal cuts across racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic lines [with] 
considerable support for expansion of the program." 
 
<p>Sweet vindication indeed. Since its inception in 1983, the DARE curriculum had 
rapidly spread from the Los Angeles area to schools across the country. In fact, more than 
half of all schools in the United States currently use the program; almost 20 million 
schoolkids a year are visited at least once by a DARE instructor. Despite such success, 
however, critics had been increasingly vocal in recent years, attacking the program as a 
costly and ineffective way of teaching kids about the perils of drug abuse. They claimed 
that DARE was just another untested pedagogical gimmick that served no purpose other 
than soaking up private donations and local, state, and federal tax dollars.  
 
<p>The newly released study, then, would simultaneously silence naysayers while 
boosting DARE's shot at more public funds and deeper penetration into schools. This is 
no penny ante business, either: DARE, which was specifically held up as exemplary in 
two sections of last fall's crime bill, is competing with other drug-ed programs for a 
chunk of the more than $500 million the feds put aside for such instruction. And running 
DARE takes a lot of money. A DARE spokesperson claims the program costs somewhat 
less than $200 million annually, but other credible estimates range as high as $700 
million, once all costs are considered.  
 
<p>The claims in the government flyer were accurate--to a point. The three-year study, 
commissioned by the National Institute of Justice, the research office for the U.S. 
Department of Justice, did include those observations. Researchers found that DARE 
raises children's self-esteem, polishes their social skills, and improves their attitudes 
toward police.  
 
<p>But unfortunately for DARE boosters, the study also proved something else: DARE 
doesn't have a measurable effect on drug abuse. While the flyer devoted ample space to 
puffery, it dismissed the critical heart of the study in just two terse sentences. And it did 
not mention that NIJ had refused to publish the study, despite positive peer review.  
 
<p>Charges and countercharges flew throughout the early weeks of October.NIJ was 
trying to put a positive spin on bad news and suppressing the study, claimed DARE 
critics. Not so, NIJ Director Jeremy Travis replied in one letter to the editor: Questions 
about "the scientific validity" of the study were raised by NIJ reviewers, and the work did 
not meet their "high standards of methodological rigor."  
 
<p>Travis's letter was a stinging rebuke to the prestigious Research Triangle Institute 
(RTI), which has authored hundreds of government studies without complaint. Under 
pressure to withdraw the study or rewrite the conclusions, the scientists stood by their 
work. "We agreed to disagree," says principal author Susan Ennett.  
 
<p>Accusations of faulty research trouble Ennett and her co-authors, who point out that 
ongoing government reviews examined their work in progress."We worked with NIJ 
throughout, sending drafts and getting back comments,"says Ennett. "[The review] 
didn't just happen at the end."  
 
<p>Ennett says there were four outside reviews over the lifetime of the three-year project, 
as well as in-house reviews by NIJ itself.  
 
<p>Another curious aspect of the government reaction is that the RTI study contained no 
original research. Only previously published studies were examined, and all had reached 
the same dismal conclusions about DARE.Says Ennett, "The results of all the studies 
used in the meta-analysis were consistent; it's not like the conclusions of these different 
studies were all over the place. We did not find any support for [a statistically significant] 
impact on drug use, and they show DARE has no effect at all on marijuana use." Another 
author of the study is more blunt: "The kids learn to have respect for police: fine and 
dandy. But if it's sold for the prevention of drug use, it's not working."  
 
<p>But even if NIJ had signed off on the study, the government had another excuse 
ready: A new, improved DARE was introduced in the autumn of 1994. And, as the flyer 
noted, "The effects of the new curriculum on learning and behavior may in turn call for a 
new evaluation." In the eyes of the Justice Department, in other words, all the research 
that proves DARE ineffective is now invalid.  
 
<p>This position infuriates many researchers, who view it as a disingenuous attempt to 
deflect criticism. Claiming that a revised program is entirely new is a well-known 
academic shell game. "There's not a new curriculum - there's a slightly changed 
curriculum," argues Richard Clayton, director of the Center of Prevention Research at the 
University of Kentucky. Clayton, who is now concluding a five-year evaluation of DARE 
in Kentucky, says his findings also match the conclusions in the RTI study.  
 
<p>"I'm really not surprised NIJ refused to publish it," says Clayton, "but I'm 
disappointed. DARE has a leadership role to play because it's in half the schools. An 
organization that receives that much public funding has an obligation to be honest with 
the public."  
 
<p>In the quiet, scholarly circles of drug-prevention research, the true reasons why NIJ 
hurried to distance itself will be debated for years. Was there pressure from DARE? 
"Roberta Silverman doesn't speak for the National Institute of Justice," a spokesperson 
for NIJ coldly explains. "We can' control DARE America. We don't give them any 
money. We don't have anything to do with them."  
 
<p>Roberta Silverman is the spokeswoman for DARE America, the nonprofit that 
provides training for the police officers who teach the curriculum in schools and that also 
supplies DARE diplomas, hats, umbrellas, pencils, shirts, and other paraphernalia sold to 
promote the program. Although DARE America had no direct influence on the decision 
by NIJ, Silverman admits contacting a scientific journal that intended to publish the 
critical RTI analysis of DARE. "I called The American Journal of Public Health. They 
didn't know the whole study hadn't been released and they didn't know it was taken out of 
context [of the NIJ report]."  
 
<p>One of the most respected academic journals in its field, The American Journal of 
Public Health accepted the RTI paper after it had been peer reviewed. Sabine Beisler, 
Public Health's director of publication, told USA Today that "DARE has tried to interfere 
with the publication of this. They tried to intimidate us." Beisler declines further 
comment, except to confirm that she was accurately quoted, and that the journal received 
several calls from DARE America.  
  
<p>Despite pressure, Public Health published the report in September 1994. Public 
Health Editor Dr. Mervin Susser sees the attempt to interfere with the publication of a 
scientific paper as misconceived at best, censorious at worst. Susser adds, "The worst of it 
is, that this study was exceptionally well-reviewed by peers in the field. It's very rare that 
an article passes so unscratched through review. The uniform appraisal was that it was 
first rate."  
 
<p>How can Public Health reviewers think the work first-rate when NIJ reviewers 
viewed it as flawed? Roberta Silverman has an idea: "I've asked myself that before. I 
think [NIJ] had a better understanding of the issues, and it reflects [Public Health's] 
dispute with NIJ. It was hot and sexy for Public Health to criticize DARE."  
 
<p>"[We] decided not to publish it because there were problems with the research," says 
NIJ spokeswoman Ann Voight. Last fall, Voight told the Boston Globe, "We stand 
behind the DARE Program as it has evolved. It has made a positive impact on children 
and law enforcement."  
 
<p>In other instances, DARE supporters have lashed out against those who fault the 
program. After a 1993 story questioning the effectiveness of DARE appeared in USA 
Today, reporter Dennis Cauchon received letters from classrooms in different parts of the 
country, all addressed to "Dear DARE-basher," and all using near-identical language.  
  
<p>When a major television network planned a story on the program, DARE America 
cooperated until it became apparent that the story wasn't going to be a puff piece. "They 
worked very hard to get our story suppressed," the producer says. After filming a segment 
about one prominent anti-DARE activist, the producer remembers an angry confrontation 
with Silverman, who asked why they were "talking to a pro-marijuana supporter."  
 
<p>To tell DARE supporters that you have spoken with program critics often invokes 
astonishment, like telling Baptists you've been to hell and chatted with Old Nick himself. 
This us-against-them viewpoint is clearly stated in a November 1994 press release 
announcing the Substance Abuse Prevention and Law Enforcement Community 
Partnership Conference. Titled "Pro-Drug Groups Behind Attack on Prevention 
Programs," the release damns as advocates of drug legalization any who criticize 
DARE.  
 
<p>"Our detractors like to characterize DARE as an 'Orwellian reality' or 'Big Brother' at 
work," DARE America Executive Director Glenn Levant is quoted as saying. "These 
bush-league tactics are transparent for what they are: attempts to support various 
individual personal agendas at the expense of our children."  
 
<p>But with all that has been written about DARE, few critics have actually been inside 
a DARE classroom, and few supporters know the origins of the controversial program. 
Only when you understand both does the true picture emerge. Whether that picture 
appears "Orwellian" depends on the viewer, but it certainly supports the claim that DARE 
fails at its basic goal of preventing drug use.<br> 
<p><b>IN THE DARE CLASSROOM</b>  
 
<p>DARE Officer Terry Campbell is on stage. It is the first time he has visited this 
fourth-grade class, but most of the children already know him well. As the full-time 
DARE instructor for Petaluma, California, he has been in the classrooms since 1988. One 
of the program's recent graduates was Polly Klaas, whose abduction and murder brought 
sad fame to this small town, 45 minutes north of San Francisco.  
 
<p>After he introduces himself, the 20-minute lesson begins. Campbell asks if anyone 
knows what DARE means and a girl is quick to respond, "Drug Abuse Resistance 
Education."  
 
<p>"What's a drug?" Campbell asks. The kids have ready answers, a mix of formal 
names and common slang. Cocaine. Alcohol. Tobacco. Coke. Pot.  
 
<p>"I know a different kind of drug," a boy adds. "It's a medicine."  
  
<p>Campbell asks, "What is it?"  
<p>"Penicillin." The officer asks if his parents ever gave him Children's Tylenol for a 
headache. Yes, they have.  
 
<p>"Did you take it in the right way?""Yes.""Today, maybe you have a bad headache. 
Should you take 10 Tylenol?""No," the children chorus."That's right. That' s called 
drug abuse. That's all a drug is--something that can help you or hurt you, depending on 
how you take it."  
 
<p>The children listen attentively. Campbell is more than a police officer; he is also a 
natural teacher, demonstrating a genius that outreaches mere talent. In front of a class, he 
is transformed, riffing off the kids' questions and comments like Robin Williams, 
connecting with every child in the room. Hands down, he is one of the best teachers 
imaginable.DARE and the city of Petaluma are fortunate. 
 
<p>In all classes, time is set aside for questions. Before school, Campbell accurately 
predicted the first question: "Have you ever shot anybody?" Similar career-day questions 
follow as the intrigued fourth graders quiz their visiting policeman. His profession is 
close to their minds; like all DARE officers, Campbell wears his uniform - but sans 
handgun, walkie-talkie, and other tools of his trade.  
 
<p>These brief kindergarten through fifth-grade classroom visits, Campbell later 
explains, lay the groundwork for the DARE core curriculum, taught in the sixth grade. 
Campbell gives safety advice, reminds them to call 911 "if they need to," and prepares 
them for their DARE sessions. Not insignificantly, he also becomes a familiar and trusted 
figure. "One of the most beneficial things of the program is that kids get to see police 
officers like human beings," he says, corroborating a finding of the NIJ-sponsored 
study.  
 
<p>Next in his schedule is a sixth-grade DARE lesson, where Campbell teaches the 
fourth of the 17 lessons in the DARE curriculum. It opens with one of the most 
controversial elements of the program: the DARE Box. On a window shelf rests the 
decorated shoebox, where anonymous notes can be passed to Campbell.  
 
<p>Campbell reads the first question: "Someone in my family is doing drugs and I'm 
worried that if I say anything it will make it worse." Heads spin. Who is it?  
 
<p>"Don't look around," Campbell says quickly. "It isn't important to know who wrote 
it."  
 
<p>A girl raises her hand. "Maybe that kid wants to talk to you about it."  
 
<p>"I'm more than willing to do that," he smiles warmly. "You all know me." He asks 
them the consequences of using an illegal drug.  
 
<p>"You could get in trouble," one child says. Another adds, "You could die."  
 
<p>Says Campbell, "It's probably OK to get them into trouble, if that's going to 
happen."  
 
<p>A boy asks, "What if it's one of your parents?"  
 
<p>"You should talk to a teacher or a counselor, or another adult you trust." As Campbell 
begins the lesson proper, he slips the note into his pocket. 
 
<p>Of the 27 children in this class, only the boy who apparently asked the question does 
not immediately open his workbook. Instead, he toys with the paper nameplate sitting on 
his desk. On the side of the wide triangle facing him are printed the eight ways to say no 
as taught by DARE. On the opposite side--the side facing Campbell--is the child's 
name.  
 
<p>What happened to the note? "I threw it away," Campbell says later. "But I didn't put it 
in the wastebasket in the classroom because one of the kids could find out who wrote it." 
Campbell was occupied with preparing for the lesson and didn't notice the nervous boy. 
Still, he says he wouldn't have acted on it if he had. "First, we don't know if they were 
illegal drugs--it could be alcohol or tobacco. Secondly, I may have a feeling that a child 
is having problems, but I can't make that assumption. Maybe he was fidgeting because he 
needed to go to the bathroom." 
 
<p>Several times in the last six years, Campbell has found signed notes in the DARE 
Box. "If a child wrote that he was being abused or in danger, of course I would follow up 
on it." Recently, he received a note indicating child abuse. "I got the child appropriate 
help," says Campbell.<br>  
 
<p><b>THE 14 PERCENT SOLUTION</b>  
 
<p>"How many of you think people will actually force you to use drugs?"Campbell 
asks, bringing Maggie, one of the girls in the class, to the front of the room. (The names 
of the children have been changed.) "It's possible that somebody's gonna hold a gun to 
your head and say, take these drugs.More common is the form that Maggie and I have 
been best friends since kindergarten and I say, 'Hey, Maggie, I got some marijuana here 
and I think it's really great'..."  
 
<p>"NO!" the child interrupts loudly, with a self-conscious giggle."...Would you like to 
try it?""NO!" "Come on, we won't be best friends if you don't.""NO!"It is the 
introduction to a lesson on peer pressure and leads into a discussion of how friends can 
subtly coax agreement. Campbell reads from the DARE workbook: "How many seventh-  
grade students out of 100 have been drunk from any alcoholic beverage?" The children, 
organized into groups of five and six, are to come up with a collective answer.  
 
<p>More than a little confusion spreads through the classroom about the assignment. The 
workbook explains this is the result of a "recent national survey," but many don't 
understand what that means. Does it include New York? one child asks. San Jose? A 
couple of minutes pass as the children struggle to understand what they are asked to 
do.  
 
<p>As the groups debate, Campbell wanders through the room, eavesdropping. Just as he 
approaches, one of the groups settles on 17.5 percent. A girl writes the number in her 
workbook as Campbell peers over her shoulder. She looks to him for approval but he says 
nothing, and his face remains blank. As he moves to the next group, she turns to 
classmates: "Let's go a little bit higher; he didn't seem to like that."  
 
<p>The five groups come to five different solutions, ranging between 42 percent and 70 
percent. Campbell smiles; the exercise has worked. The correct answer, he reveals, is 14 
percent. He points to the group that first had a 17.5 percent answer. He overheard one boy 
vote for 15 percent but relent against the collective will of the group. "This demonstrates 
how peer pressure works," Campbell says. "We allowed our peers to talk us into it. Is 
everybody out there doing drugs?"  
 
<p>The class chimes no, in unison.  
 
<p>"Just because somebody does it doesn't mean everybody does. Did I surprise you that 
the figure was so low?" Campbell asks.  
 
<p>"No," the class responds again, but weaker.  
 
<p>Unfortunately, the 14 percent statistic used in the lesson is incorrect. And it's not even 
from a recent nationwide survey - the number comes from research done between 1989 
and 1990 in California alone. The survey is done every two years for the state attorney 
general, and the most recent figure for seventh graders who have ever been intoxicated is 
23 percent.  
 
<p>Even though DARE's statistic is wrong, it is still lower than any of the estimates by 
the children. The objective of the lesson is valid; childhood perceptions of normal 
behavior can be badly skewed.  
  
<p>More troublesome is the lesson design. Only a wrong answer is "right"; the lesson 
fails if the class picks accurate numbers. When one group chose 17.5 percent, Campbell - 
probably unconsciously - led them to raise their guesstimate by implying disapproval. 
Such subtle problems with design can give even brilliant teachers like Campbell fits.  
 
<p>Shown a transcript of this session, researchers not associated with DARE agree that 
the point of the lesson was valuable but dismiss the DARE exercise as useless. "Kids 
don't relate to national or state data," says Joel Moskowitz, who has authored evaluations 
of several drug education programs. "It's what their friends are doing that counts."  
 
<p>Moskowitz and others were also critical of the role-playing between Campbell and 
Maggie. "It should have been between two adolescents," Moskowitz says. "She just 
parroted the lines the police officer expected. It's not going to be so easy to say no to a 
friend if it's going to make them your enemy."  
 
<p>As the primary author of the DARE curriculum, Dr. Ruth Rich responds to their 
criticism. "The problem with this lesson is that the kids don't understand the math," she 
says. Not so, at least in Petaluma. The children in this class actually skidded to a halt over 
the concept of a nationwide survey. The same confusion was repeated in another sixth-  
grade class, later in the day. If the point of the lesson is to teach kids that not everyone 
does drugs and "that concept is not being taught, we need to work on it," Rich 
concedes.  
 
<p>What about the complaint that a peer should have played the role of the friend 
offering Maggie drugs? Says Rich, "We have the officers role-play with the youngsters. 
We try to get the situation as real as possible, but we would never have a child offering a 
joint--it reinforces the negative."<br>  
 
<p><b>BIRTH OF A NATION</b>  
 
<p>The problems with this lesson demonstrate something else as well: Designing an 
effective anti-drug program ain't easy. When Maggie role-plays saying no to Officer 
Campbell, she reinforces her skills at turning down drags from a uniformed policeman. 
Not a likely real-life scenario. But if Maggie rejects a reefer from classmate Tommy, 
Maggie has a more realistic experience - and Tommy gets some practice in pushing 
drugs.  
 
<p>Similarly, it's important for kids to know that drug abuse is the exception rather than 
the norm. Is there a better solution than the troublesome "national survey" question? 
 
<p>"They borrowed that from SMART," says veteran researcher Bill Hansen."We 
moved well beyond that, but it took us years to find out how to best get the information 
across to kids."  
 
<p>Started in 1981, Project SMART (short for Self-Management and Resistance 
Training) was one of the pioneer anti-drug school programs, preceding even Nancy 
Reagan's plea to "Just say no." Hansen was one of the researchers hired by the University 
of Southern California to develop SMART. To test their theories, they used the mammoth 
Los Angeles Unified School District.  
 
<p>By all accounts, those were heady times for the scientists. With over 20,000 middle-  
school students available, L.A. Unified was a living laboratory. At weekly meetings, 
then-L.A. Unified health education specialist and eventual DARE curriculum author Ruth 
Rich provided classroom-based feedback to the team of USC researchers developing the 
program.  
 
<p>USC was testing two completely different versions of the SMART curriculum. Bill 
Hansen explains: "One was 'affective.' It focused on self-esteem and setting goals. The 
other was 'resistance training,' which concentrated on social influences, such as [cigarette 
and alcohol] ads."  
  
<p>But while Project SMART was still in its toddling stages, another player joined the 
game: then-Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates. "In 1983, Daryl Gates came on 
board," Rich says. "They had just had another high school drug bust, and he said he'd 
rather deploy his resources for prevention, that they were going to be coming into the 
schools."  
 
<p>Fortunately, a promising new drug-prevention program was at hand: Project SMART. 
Rich approached Andy Johnson, leader of the USC research team, with the idea of 
sharing SMART with the cops. "They [police] were going to be coming into the schools," 
says Rich. "I asked Andy if we could work with him and he said, no, he had problems 
with [police in the classroom], so we took SMART and used that."  
 
<p>Though sympathetic to Rich's dilemma, Johnson says he had serious objections to 
handing an experimental educational program over to the local police. He worried that 
police might have credibility problems with sophisticated, urban Los Angeles seventh 
graders.  
 
<p>Another concern was unrelated to drug education: He wanted the police version of 
SMART confined to L.A. Unified - the program was copyrighted by USC. "There was 
discussion about copyright concerns, but Ruth said they had made changes [to the 
curriculum]. I made the decision to let it go, not pursue the issue. We never thought it 
would become an international movement and DARE would take on a life of its 
own." 
 
<p>Rich says they asked permission to use the SMART curriculum, and, for her new 
program, boldly combined the affective and resistance-training models. She also 
incorporated police officers to teach the material. Did Gates try to dictate what would be 
taught? No, Rich insists: "There was pressure that we had to provide a program, but 
[Gates] didn't tell us what had to be in it."  
 
<p>DARE premiered later in 1983, piloted in 50 schools with 10 police officers. Rich 
heeded Andy Johnson's advice about grade level. The new DARE program was taught in 
fifth and sixth grades instead of seventh. 
 
<p>This slide to a younger age leads DARE critics to suggest that the program is 
developmentally inappropriate, that the material is better suited for older children. 
Several reviewers who read the "national survey" transcript commented that it revealed 
that the children weren't ready for this type of material.  
  
<p>As DARE was going forth and multiplying in L.A. Unified schools, the USC team 
continued its research. They discovered an important difference between the two versions 
of the SMART curriculum: The affective program didn't work. Not only that, it had the 
dreaded "boomerang" effect - it actually encouraged some children to fiddle with drugs. 
Yet the school district had already adopted the affective program as part of the new 
DARE curriculum.  
 
<p>"L.A. Unified grew distant," recalls Hansen. "Which cut them off from our research 
of the two programs, the one that worked and one that didn't. They just put the two 
together. What they took was the prototype; we went through 30 versions of the 
curriculum, so a lot of the stuff they lifted was antiquated, in our view."  
 
<p>Andy Johnson also sees DARE as reflecting the "antiquated" SMART prototype, and 
remembers offering to help fix it. "We talked to them about evaluating it, but DARE was 
never interested," he says. Johnson recalls there was an "anti-intellectual attitude" among 
the new leadership elbowing their way into the program. But to Gates and others, DARE 
didn't need fixing; what it needed was money, and friends in high places. <br>  
  
<p><b>SPREADING THE GOSPEL</b>  
 
<p>By the autumn of 1985, DARE was entrenched in the Los Angeles schools.That by 
itself was good news in the "Just Say No" years; most of the other drug-prevention 
programs in use around the country were small-scale projects, untested outside of a 
handful of classrooms. And worse, many of those programs were found to have little or 
no effect on drug use when evaluated. Some even had the boomerang effect, like the 
prototypes of Project SMART. There was just one problem with DARE: It hadn't been 
independently evaluated at all.  
 
<p>To find out how well it worked, the National Institute of Justice sent consultant 
William DeJong to California. "I wrote the first published study of DARE [in 1986], and 
it showed that there were positive results," says DeJong. "Based on my study, NIJ 
decided to devote money to DARE." Another reason NIJ went ahead, according to 
DeJong, was that DARE was based on Project SMART. Then in its fifth year, the 
government-funded SMART had refined its program several generations beyond the 
prototype adapted by DARE.  
 
<p>With the stamp of NIJ approval, Gates won a $140,000 grant from the Bureau of 
Justice Assistance, a part of the Department of Justice, to take DARE nationwide. DeJong 
continued to be involved, authoring the DARE implementation manual for BJA.  
 
<p>While $140,000 might be enough to fund a hometown anti-drug program, DARE 
needed far more to go national. The solution came from Congress in the form of the Drug 
Free Schools and Communities Act of 1986. Buried in the small print was an entitlement 
for at least 10 percent of the state grants to governors to go only to programs that 
included "classroom instruction by uniformed law enforcement officials." A host of other 
criteria were listed that were met only by programs "such as Project Drug Abuse 
Resistance Education." By 1992, their share of the federal pie came to almost $10 
million.  
 
<p>To manage the growing DARE movement and help spread the gospel, the nonprofit 
corporation DARE America was formed in 1987. More grants from BJA soon followed, 
which allowed DARE America to establish regional training centers throughout the 
United States. DARE was fast becoming America's de facto drug-education 
program.  
 
<p>The 1986 entitlement helped fuel DARE's explosive growth, but it by no means paid 
all the bills. Most funding came from the army of fervent DARE supporters in the 
community, eager to find an easy solution to the problem of juvenile drug abuse. DARE 
became "a rallying symbol to do something positive about the drug abuse problem," as 
one state director of DARE told Congress in 1990. 
 
<p>Once again, Petaluma, California is probably typical. It costs the city over $100,000 
each year to pay the salaries for Officer Campbell and a part-time reserve officer and to 
supply DARE workbooks and awards to approximately 800 children. (Graduates are 
given free DARE T-shirts, pencils, rulers, and a diploma.) Civic-minded real-estate 
developers have supplied most of these funds since 1990, and individuals in the 
community also make donations. But the contractors' tithe ends this year; what will the 
city do?  
 
<p>Probably look to Uncle Sam. The Drug Free Schools and Communities Act - now 
called the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1994 - includes more 
than $400 million dollars for DARE and other programs. Gone is the $10 million 
entitlement; now DARE competes with other programs for its piece of the federal action. 
But of the 14 activities listed in the bill, most are vague: "Before- and after-school 
activities" is a typical description. And not only is DARE mentioned by name, it is 
specified twice, in different parts of the act. (The only other specific program mentioned 
is "Project Legal Lives," a program for district attorneys to conduct mock trials.)  
 
<p>And it's not difficult to predict how a city like Petaluma will spend its drug-education 
dollars. DARE has enormous grassroots support; the kids like it; the parents and teachers 
like it; and perhaps most of all, the local police like it. Any program with such grassroots 
support wields considerable clout on Capitol Hill; when the Clinton administration 
recommended eliminating drug-education entitlements in March 1994, the House killed 
the motion, 418 to 1.  
 
<p>DARE also appears twice in the crime bill, where it will wrestle all comers for $284 
million by 1996, rising to $375 million by the end of the decade. Sen. Joseph Biden (D-  
Del.), chair of the Judiciary Committee, takes credit for the inclusion. "As you know, it's 
a pretty popular program, so it wasn't a question of not including it," says a Biden 
staffer. 
 
<p>How much does DARE cost nationally? Several newspapers have claimed $700 
million annually, close to the appropriation for the entire Drug Enforcement 
Administration. DARE America spokesperson Silverman sees the $700 million statistic 
as sloppy journalism. "In 1992, we estimated the value of officer services at $153 million. 
Actual cash for DARE America was $1.5 million. I don't know where they got $700 
million."  
 
<p>But according to USA Today reporter Dennis Cauchon, the estimate comes from her 
boss, DARE America Executive Director Glenn Levant. "Levant and I went over all the 
numbers," Cauchon says. "Including every cent in private donations. It includes all 
money actually spent on DARE every year."  
 
<p>All told, local DARE programs are eligible for a direct share of more than half a 
billion federal dollars annually, still short of the $700 million total in operating costs. As 
in Petaluma, the difference will be made up by civic groups, individuals, and local 
government. School districts that are strapped to buy textbooks pitch in, as do cities and 
counties teetering on bankruptcy. In Petaluma, DARE Officer Terry Campbell tells a 
story: "At the end of the school year, the teacher asked the kids what they wanted to do 
with the leftover class treasury. She told them they could have a pizza party, whatever 
they wanted. The kids said they wanted to give the money to DARE." With such 
enthusiasm for the program, it almost begs the question: What if it doesn't work?<br> 
 
<p><b>THE EMPEROR'S CLOTHING</b> 
 
<p>DARE keeps children away from drugs. That raison d'tre sold thousands of 
communities on the program and keeps DARE in the schools, even if budget cuts must be 
made somewhere else. But by 1991, there were more than a dozen studies that claimed 
DARE didn't work at all. Not that it was useless: It had positive effects on children's 
knowledge about drugs, helped develop their social skills, and improved their attitude 
about police. But all these studies said the same thing about drug use - if DARE had any 
effect at all, it was short lived.  
 
<p>Except, of course, for one study: the 1986 evaluation by William DeJong, used by 
NIJ to start the DARE bandwagon rolling. When DeJong's research appeared in the 
Journal of Drug Education, his colleagues called the design of his study "seriously 
flawed." Among their complaints was that the children were given no test before starting 
the DARE program, which made it impossible to evaluate any claims of improvement. 
Critics also noted that the study revealed positive effects only with boys; there was a 
significant negative impact on the DARE girls - the boomerang effect.  
 
<p>In 1991, NIJ decided to settle the question of DARE's worth by hiring analysts at 
Research Triangle Institute (RTI) to do a comprehensive evaluation. To DARE, it seemed 
like vindication and due respect was finally at hand. "The review of the DARE evaluation 
literature will give us ammunition to respond to critics who charge that DARE has not 
proved its effectiveness," read a DARE letter sent to state coordinators.  
 
<p>RTI researchers, of course, found no new ammunition for DARE in the studies. Yes, 
the program improved the relationship between schoolchildren and the police, and taught 
the kids many useful things. But as far as stopping them from using drugs... sorry.  
 
<p>A preliminary version of the RTI report was released at a 1993 San Diego conference, 
which devoted an entire day to DARE. After listening to the presentations, DARE 
America's Glenn Levant dismissed the criticism out of hand. He said, "The only way that 
I know that you can determine if DARE is effective is through a long-term, seven-year-  
plus longitudinal national evaluation." The studies discussed, Levant argued, were merely 
"a bunch of $200,000 and $300,000 superficial evaluations" that were not conclusive. A 
valid criticism, perhaps, but these were the same "superficial evaluations" that DARE was 
prepared to accept for vindication.  
 
<p>A former Los Angeles deputy police chief, Levant added that few children were 
arrested for looting during the 1992 L.A. riots. Drug-dealing was also down in the 
schools, he said. "Why? Because the officers, undercover, on campus, are talking to kids 
about where they get drugs on campus. They're getting the DARE message from high 
school kids. So does DARE work? You're darned right it does."  
 
<p>Levant's remarks about "officers, undercover, on campus" reflect the original 
justification used by Gates: Get police into the schools to arrest drug dealers. While it 
may serve the laudable goal of keeping drugs out of the schoolyard, covert evidence-  
gathering police work is not one of the stated objectives of DARE. 
 
<p>These comments also typify DARE America's response to criticism. A 1993 Gallup 
poll of recent DARE graduates is frequently cited by Levant to demonstrate the program's 
worth, as is a survey of enthusiastic school administrators. But surveys and anecdotes are 
far different from rigorous scientific evaluation. If these same policemen obtained 
evidence of a crime, would they want professional technicians to analyze it or would they 
ask Gallup to quiz the public?  
 
<p>Project SMART researcher Bill Hansen was surprised by DARE's attitude toward 
researchers in San Diego. "It created a firestorm. Before that, they had never talked to a 
scientist; they didn't consider discussing the curriculum relevant to what they were 
doing."  
 
<p>After San Diego, DARE America created a nine-member "Scientific Advisory Board" 
for the first time. The board has recommended that a "learning lab" be created for testing 
of the curriculum, but DARE America has not taken their advice.  
 
<p>A new curriculum was first mentioned at the conference, where Hansen and others 
learned that DARE was planning the first major changes in 10 years. To Hansen, this 
announcement presented an amusing contradiction: "They basically said at San Diego, 
'Our program doesn't have a problem - and don't worry, we're fixing it.'" 
 <br>  
<p><b>SPIN CONTROL</b>  
 
<p>The new version of DARE hit the schools in the fall of 1994. The program now 
includes lessons on gang violence and added emphasis is given to the evils of 
tobacco.  
 
<p>Perhaps uncoincidentally, the new emphasis on violence and cigarettes also matches 
new criteria for funding. Violence is a key word in the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and 
Communities Act, and similar wording can be found in the federal crime bill. States such 
as California and Massachusetts also have hefty set-asides for anti-tobacco programs, 
funded by cigarette taxes. The new, improved description of DARE seems almost 
custom-designed for these new requirements.  
 
<p>Also, says author Ruth Rich, "the new curriculum is 70 percent more interactive than 
the old. Now there's no place [in the program] where we don't have the child 
involved."  
 
<p>This change appears to be a positive one. "Interactive" means the child is an active 
participant, as opposed to quietly listening to a lecture by the DARE instructor. Although 
all researchers shown the transcript of the "national survey" question faulted the merits of 
the lesson, they all approved of the way DARE had the children discuss it in small 
groups.  
 
<p>Despite the revamped curriculum, controversy ensued as DARE America tried to 
influence The American Journal of Public Health and NIJ released the good news - only 
flyer. Spokes-persons from NIJ insist that DARE America did not influence their decision 
to tone down the negative aspects of the research, claiming instead that their independent 
reviewers had recommended that approach. Who were these reviewers, and how 
"independent" were they? NIJ declines to reveal their identities. "It's always been our 
policy to keep the names private, so there won't be pressure," says a NIJ spokeswoman. 
"We feel strongly about the independence of our evaluators." 
 
<p>But DARE America readily supplies the name of one of the reviewers: William 
DeJong. The same man whose early, positive critique was so pivotal in rooting DARE in 
our schools.  
 
<p>Says DeJong, "RTI should have said, 'Here's what we did. It's the best we can do with 
[our analysis], but not too much should be made of this because there's a new curriculum.' 
They should have kept it in perspective."  
 
<p>Now a lecturer at Harvard, DeJong says he hoped "RTI would back away from its 
strong anti-DARE conclusion." DeJong particularly objects to comparing DARE to 
programs that showed better results but were university-based and required intensive 
training or a difficult-to-sustain level of resources. "It's like comparing a nurtured 
hothouse flower to a national program." 
 
<p>DeJong's comment brings to mind a fundamental complaint made by critics: DARE is 
fast becoming a government-sanctioned monopoly. DARE is now in 8,000 communities 
and more than 50 percent of our schools. Six million children will receive DARE 
instruction this year, and another 19 million will have classroom visits from their local 
DARE officer. DARE has grown like the kudzu vine, blanketing the country and 
smothering competing "hothouse" drug-prevention projects. For instance, both Andy 
Johnson and Bill Hansen have developed drug-education programs since the days of 
Project SMART, but compared to the enormous numbers of kids receiving DARE, these 
are little more than humble science-fair projects.  
  
<p>And without research, we won't know what - if anything - will prevent kids from 
abusing drugs. This is the dismal news about drug education: All programs are qualified 
failures, providing only small gains that soon disappear. For all the tinkering over the 
years, Project SMART has achieved only modest reductions in drug abuse, primarily by 
postponing the age at which a child begins to experiment with cigarettes, alcohol, and 
other drugs.  
 
<p>Asked if the new version of DARE was tested before it was introduced into 
classrooms nationwide, DARE America spokeswoman Roberta Silverman says there 
were pilot tests, but "we only did a limited evaluation of the new curriculum - just a 
checks-and-balances kind of thing about the pilot testing."  
 
<p>The new DARE curriculum might be better than the old. Although highly unlikely, it 
is also possible that it could be worse, more likely to produce a boomerang effect. 
Without evaluations, we don't know. Are there at least plans to put the new program 
under a microscope? "We don't have any research lined up, but we're seeking government 
funding to do a longitudinal study," says Silverman.  
 
<p>Even if started today, a five-year longitudinal study would be completed in the year 
2000, just as the children of the first DARE graduates will be introduced to their DARE 
officer in kindergarten. By 2000, DARE will likely be in all our schools, and all those 
"hothouse" programs will have become academic footnotes. And doubtless all of the 
parents, teachers, administrators, and police departments will still embrace the painless, 
easy solutions that DARE offers, happy that at least they're doing something positive to 
stop the scourge of drug abuse by children.

 Reefer Madness: Inside the Industry

<center> <h3> 
 Inside the Industry 
</center> </h3> 
 
 
<br> 
<p> 
Steve White looks like an ordinary Indiana farmer with slightly unkempt 
 hair, a graying beard, teeth stained by nicotine, and strong hands. The 
 day we met, he wore an old flannel shirt, gray pants, and battered work 
 boots. His voice has a low rural twang. He seems to belong in an old 
 pickup, ridding through a vast dusty field. White is the Indiana 
 coordinator for the Drug Enforcement Administration's Cannabis 
 Eradication/Suppression Program. Of his twenty-six years in federal law 
 enforcement, twenty-one have been spent in Indiana, working undercover. He 
 knows the state backwards and forwards -- has walked it, driven it, and flown 
 low over it every summer, scrutinizing hills and farmland. Nobody ever 
 thinks he is a cop. He gets along well with rural people. He grew up in New 
 York City and attended P.S. 20; his father worked on Wall Street. He 
 travels to London each year to indulge a passion for collecting English 
 antique toy soldiers. Special Agent White would be an implausible character 
 in any work of fiction. Savvy, articulate, self-deprecating, and blunt, he 
 defies easy categorization and probably knows more about growing marijuana 
 than most of the people he arrests. 
 
<p> 
Claude Atkinson was an extremely talented grower with a "good 
product," White says -- and "La super salesman." The operation near Eminence was of 
average size for its time. It is difficult, even from the air, to find 
marijuana hidden in corn: "Remember <i>North by Northwest</i>?" White says. 
"Cary Grant in the cornfield?" We don't have cornfields like that anymore, with 
wide rows. They broadcast the stuff, and it's just thicker than hell." Sometimes 
patches of marijuana will be distributed here and there amid hundreds of acres. 
Discovering one may not lead to the others. Growers tend to be much more 
concerned about hiding their marijuana from thieves than from the government. A 
rural underworld has emerged around marijuana, secretive and unknown to 
outsiders; booby traps are laid in cornfields. There is now a group of people 
in the Marijuana Belt. known as "patch pirates," who earn a living solely by 
stealing marijuana from growers, whom they follow. White acknowledges that the 
booby traps are usually aimed at patch pirates, not his own men; nevertheless, 
fishhooks strung at eye level on fishing line are nondiscriminatory. Outdoor 
marijuana farms have become smaller in the past few years, though last summer 
White's agents found "60,000 beautiful plants" on a farm in Tippecanoe County. 
The case proved a disappointment: the DEA never found the grower. What I want is 
bodies," White explains. "I don't give a damn about the dope -- that's just 
something we're going to burn up." His job involves a daily cat-and-mouse 
pursuit of marijuana growers, with both sides changing tactics, adopting new 
technologies, and often, after an arrest, amicably discussing a tricks of the 
trade. White harbors no animosity toward his prey. "These are not heroin or 
cocaine dealers," he says. "They're not violent. I find a lot of them personally 
engaging." What they are doing is against the law, however, and White loves 
tracking them down. He has had a good deal of success lately. In 1992 Indiana 
led the nation in federal arrests for marijuana. Last year it ranked third. 
 
<p> 
 Take a map of the United States and draw a circle. including within 
its 
 circumference Indiana, Illinois, and Michigan, with portions of Ohio to the 
 east, Kentucky and Tennessee to the south, and Missouri, Iowa, and Nebraska 
 to the west. The region within that circle, Steve White believes, is 
 producing the majority of the marijuana grown in the United States. The 
 highest-quality marijuana is cultivated indoors on the West Coast, but for 
 sheer volume, no other area surpasses the U.S. heartland. White does not 
 find this surprising. During the Second World War the U.S. government 
 encouraged farmers throughout the Corn Belt to plant almost 300,000 acres 
 of marijuana, in the hopes of replacing fiber supplies from Asia which had 
 been cut off by the Japanese. The program, whose slogan was "Hemp for 
 Victory," turned out to be a financial disaster and left marijuana growing 
 wild throughout the region. Known as ditchweed, this marijuana now blankets 
 tens of thousands of acres. For years it had a negligible delta-9-THC 
 content, and was used mainly as filler by drug dealers, but there is 
 evidence that the ditchweed may be cross-pollinating with the potent 
 marijuana now cultivated outdoors. The same growing conditions and soil that 
 are ideal for corn are also ideal for marijuana. Most local sheriff's 
 departments employ only three to five officers, with more important things 
 to do than hunt for marijuana. And over the past fifteen years there have 
 been a lot of people with strong agricultural skills who have badly needed 
 money have wanted more of it than almost any other job in the region could 
 provide. A bushel of corn sells for roughly $2.50, a bushel of manicured 
 marijuana for about $70,000. White thinks that marijuana is the largest 
 cash crop in the United States, and if not the largest in Indiana, then 
 right up there with corn and soybeans. Though he is proud of what his 
 office has accomplished, White has no illusions: -- "There's more than we 
 think." 
 
<p> 
During the 1960s and early 1970s nearly all the marijuana smoked in the 
United States was imported, mainly from Mexico, Colombia, and 
 Jamaica. Domestic production rose in reaction to a number of events. The 
 spraying of an herbicide, paraquat, over Mexican marijuana fields, begun in 
 1975, created uneasiness about that nation's product. Successful 
 interdiction efforts by the U.S. Border Patrol and the Coast Guard made 
 smuggling marijuana more difficult. And the tougher legal sanctions against 
 trafficking led some foreign drug dealers to switch from marijuana, a bulk 
 agricultural good with a strong smell, to cocaine, which is easier to 
 conceal and brings a tar higher return per pound. As marijuana prices rose, 
 American growers responded to consumer demand. Mark A. R. Kleiman, an 
 associate professor at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, 
 finds this to be a rare instance in which protectionism actually worked. 
 The anti-drug movement and the burgeoning American marijuana crop led to 
 the DEA to devote more of its resources to marijuana investigations. 
 Kleiman estimates that by 1988 federal anti-marijuana efforts totaled 
 approximately $970 million -- about 20 to 25 percent of all federal 
 drug-enforcement expenditures. By 1992 federal convictions for marijuana 
 outnumbered those for heroin, crack cocaine, and LSD combined. The DEA's 
 Cannabis Eradication/Suppression Program began in 1979 in two states, 
 California and Hawaii; it now looks for marijuana farming operations 
 -- called 
 "grows" or "gardens" by members of the trade -- in all fifty states. 
 
<p> 
 No one knows exactly how much marijuana is cultivated in the United 
States. 
 The numbers published by the government -- or anyone else -- are largely 
 speculative. In 1992 the DEA eradicated 3,405 metric tons of cultivated 
 marijuana in the United States, an amount the DEA says represents more than 
 half the total domestic output. Critics believe that the DEA actually finds 
 only 10 to 20 percent of the marijuana being grown in this country. With 
 prices ranging from $500 a pound, for low-quality New Mexican marijuana, 
 to more than $5,000 a pound for "boutique" strains like Northern Lights and 
 Afghan Kush, it can be confidently stated that the black market for 
 American marijuana, whatever the actual tonnage, is immense.

Growers are increasingly moving their crops indoors, using artificial light 
 and hydroponics, to avoid theft, reduce the risk of detection, control the 
 growing process, and profit from up to six harvests a year. Thirty mature 
 plants can easily be grown in an area the size of a bathtub. I asked 
Steve White to list some of the places where he has discovered indoor grow 
 operations. He laughed. "It would be tough for me to say places we haven't 
 found them." Often a false wall hides a grow room in a house, or a house's 
 foundation doesn't match its basement. which seems oddly smaller, or there 
 are second stories with no stairwells, or crawl spaces are hidden beneath 
 floors. Once White rummaged through a child's closet and found the entrance 
 to a grow area behind the toys. Without need of a search warrant, the DEA 
 employs thermal-imaging devices, mounted on helicopters and low-flying 
 airplanes, to detect abnormal heat sources that may indicate the presence 
 of an indoor growing operation -- or a pottery kiln, or a Jacuzzi. What is 
 found depends upon the skill of the technician. White has learned that one 
 of the best ways to find an indoor grow area is with his nose: no matter 
 how well-vented the operation, and despite electronic devices that can 
 neutralize odors in the air, marijuana will exude a powerful scent. A few 
 years ago indoor grows were often huge. A group of janitors in Anderson. 
 Indiana, who had traveled to Israel to study hydroponics, were caught with 
 8,100 plants in a building with walls constructed a foot thick to thwart 
 infrared detection. Nowadays growers rent storage units and apartments, 
 using phony names and paying in cash, and build small grow operations 
at 
 different locations, with timing devices and automatic controls. The 
 authorities may find one or two -- a loss anticipated in the grower's 
business 
 plan -- without being able to trace ownership. White has smoked marijuana 
once, while working undercover, and did not enjoy 
 the experience. He chain-smokes cigarettes, regrets it, and sees no need to 
 add marijuana to he nation's list of legal drugs. We've got tobacco, we've 
 got alcohol," he said. "Jesus Christ, do we need another hallucinogenic, 
carcinogenic substance on the market?" What disturbs him most about 
 marijuana is the phenomenal sums of money it funnels into an underground 
 economy, and the great resulting potential for corruption among public 
 officials. I asked whether a sense of futility ever creeps into his work, 
 given the extent of' cultivation in his state. "I'm not such a tool as to 
 sit here and tell you that we're going to wipe out marijuana." he replied. 
 But there is no doubt in his mind that the DEA exerts a deterrent effect. 
 "Every time we have a helicopter go up on a mission. ' White said. 
 "there's someone down below who sees it and thinks. Maybe I better not." 
 
 
 
<p> 
Ralph Weisheit, a professor of criminal justice at Illinois State 
 University, does not know Steve White but has come to many of the same 
 conclusions about marijuana cultivation in the Midwest. Weisheit first 
 became interested in the subject eight years ago, when he saw, on the 
 television news, an old Illinois farmer being arrested for cultivating 
 marijuana. The farmer and his son never smoked marijuana; they grew it to 
 save their farm from foreclosure. Weisheit was intrigued. With a grant from 
 the research arm of the U.S. Justice Department, he conducted a two-year 
 study of marijuana cultivation, interviewing law-enforcement officials in 
 five states and dozens of Illinois growers who had been caught and 
 convicted. The book based on that study, <i> Domestic Marijuana: A Neglected 
 Industry</i> (1992), chronicles the rise of marijuana production in the United 
 States and offers a fascinating portrait of the growers. Weisheit agrees 
 that the majority of marijuana in America probably originates in the 
 nine-state region described by Steve White. He also thinks that marijuana 
 is the nation's largest cash crop, by a very wide margin. 
 
 
<p> 
Estimates of how many Americans grow marijuana range from one to three 
 million, of which anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 are commercial growers. 
 Weisheit found that aside from being predominantly white and male, 
 marijuana growers generally do not fit any common stereotypes. Some are 
 pragmatists, growing the drug purely for the money; during the farm crisis 
 of the 1980s many farmers in the Marijuana Belt started cultivating 
 marijuana out of desperation. They found it not only easy money but also 
 easy work. As one farmer told Weisheit, "You know, I spent most of my life 
 trying to kill weeds, so trying to keep one alive was hardly a challenge." 
 Other growers are hustlers by nature, classic American entrepreneurs; they 
 might as well be selling time shares in a vacation condominium. They try 
 to build marijuana empires. The risks of the trade only add to its appeal. 
 Other growers are less competitive, giving away marijuana to friends or 
 selling it at slightly above cost, sharing agricultural techniques, 
 comparing their crops the way neighbors might compare homegrown tomatoes. 
 Marijuana growers are educated and uneducated, liberal and conservative. 
 They are extremely secretive, worrying more about thieves than about the 
 police. Few belong to NORML (the National Organization tor the Reform of 
 Marijuana Laws) and few read <i>High Times</i> magazine or add their names 
 to any list that might arouse suspicion. Indoor growing often attracts 
 people who love gizmos. There are endless contraptions that can be added to 
 a grow room, from computer-controlled watering systems to electric tables 
 that distribute nutrients evenly by tilting back and forth. Some growers 
 become connoisseurs, producing high-quality marijuana in small quantities, 
 manipulating not only the level of delta-9-THC through cross-breeding but 
 also the proportions of all the other cannabinoids to subtly -- or not so 
 subtly -- affect the nature of the high. Weisheit met growers and 
 law-enforcement officers alike who were extraordinarily passionate about 
 marijuana, eager to discuss its arcane details for hours. He was surprised, 
 after the publication of his book, by how little controversy it generated 
 in either camp. His mother was disturbed, however, by one of its central 
 implications: "She's very anti-drug," Weisheit says, "and her comment was, 'The thing I don't like about 
this book is that it makes these people seem 
 so normal.'" 
 
 
 
<p> 
Late one night I met a commercial marijuana grower who introduced himself as 
 "Dave." He has been growing marijuana on and off for more than a decade, 
 beginning outdoors and graduating to a series of increasingly complex 
 indoor grow systems. Understandably paranoid and suspicious, Dave is also 
 quite proud of his work and regrets being unable to discuss it with 
 friends. His grow operation had to be built surreptitiously, over a period 
 of weeks, like a factory assembled by hand. It utilizes about $50,000 worth 
 of high-tech hydroponic equipment. When the construction was completed the 
 whole thing looked so beautiful that Dave wanted to throw an opening-night 
 party, but he decided that would not be a good idea. Though he always hated 
 gardening and never passed a science class in his life, he now has a grasp 
 of marijuana botany, plant biology, and advanced greenhouse-management 
 techniques which only Special Agent White could fully appreciate. As he 
 smoked some of his most recent harvest, Dave shared with me some of the 
 pleasures, risks, rewards, and bizarre phenomena associated with his 
 profession. 
 
 
<p> 
 Hidden behind a fake wall, entered through a secret door, in a 
neighborhood 
 where you would never, ever, expect to find it, Dave' s operation is much 
 larger than most. There are hundreds of marijuana plants in long rows, 
 growing from cubes of rock wool, a soil-less medium spun from synthetic 
 fibers, connected through an intricate system of white plastic pipes. 
 Suspended above them are extremely bright high-pressure sodium lights, 
 which require a surge of power from special ballasts to start up. On the 
 ceiling is the bluish flame of a carbon-dioxide generator burning natural 
 gas. The windows have been sealed and blacked out. The room is quite warm, 
 the air thick and humid, the whole place filled with a pungent smell 
 reminiscent of fresh hay. Like a greenhouse without glass, it feels very 
 still and quiet, except for the sound of water rushing through narrow 
 pipes. 
 
<p> 
When everything is running smoothly, Dave controls the elements 
necessary 
 for his plants: air, light. heat, and water. In a closed chamber there is 
 no wind; here a ventilation system provides it, circulating air rich in 
 carbon dioxide. When outdoor temperatures drop too low, Dave uses the CO2 
 generator on the ceiling -- in effect "fertilizing the air." Pumps and timers 
 automatically water the plants, also delivering nutrients such as nitrogen, 
 phosphorus, and potassium, which would normally be derived from soil. One 
 of the critical factors in growing marijuana is the proportion of darkness 
 to light. Sometimes Dave's high-pressure sodium lights burn eighteen hours 
 a day, raising the temperature in the grow room to as high as 110 degrees. 
 During the female plant's reproductive stage there must be long periods of 
 total, uninterrupted darkness. As little as two foot-candles of light can 
 disrupt the delicate process by which delta-9-THC accumulates in the buds. 
 Turning on a flashlight at the wrong moment, Dave says, is enough to ruin 
 his plants. 
 
<p> 
He is truly a connoisseur, growing an expensive strain of marijuana from the 
 northern Hindu Kush. As he describes how some outdoor growers stuff 
 marijuana into plastic garbage bags while it is still wet, he grimaces, 
 like a master vintner appalled by the improper handling of grapes. The 
 buds are very fragile, he says: "You're trying to coax this mature flower to 
 retain its essence -- and then store it and seal it at that instant in time." His finished product is deep green 
and aromatic, like some rare, exotic 
 spice. 
 
 
<p> 
Growing marijuana indoors requires much more work than cultivating it 
 outdoors. There is also more potential for disaster. A splash of liquid on 
 a hot light will cause it to explode. A broken pipe can flood the room with 
 hundreds of gallons of water. A power outage shuts the whole system down. 
 The nutrient solution, if improperly monitored, can quickly turn too acidic 
 and, as Dave puts it, "give the plants a heart attack." More common, and 
 yet somehow more surreal, are insect infestations that can harm valuable 
 young plants. Dave has battled spider mites, greenhouse whiteflies, and 
 aphids. Insecticides are not an option in an enclosed room, with a crop 
 that will be smoked. Dave uses biological controls, unleashing hungry young 
 predators upon unwanted bugs. Recently he released thousands of miniature 
 wasps. This is insanity, he thought; but it worked. Inside a nearby 
 refrigerator he always keeps 500 ladybug eggs, next to the soda, in case of 
 an emergency. At the moment Dave is contending with gnats, who leave his 
 plants alone but swarm and bite him as he walks about the grow room in the 
 dark.

<h3>Scholars Program Objective</h3><p>

The Project on Death in Americas Scholars Program hopes to identify
outstanding faculty and clinicians who are making such a commitment, and
to support them in disseminating existing models of good care, developing
new models for improving the care of the dying, and developing new
approaches to the education of health professionals about the care of
dying patients and their families.  This program aims to promote the
visibility and prestige of clinicians committed to this area and to
enhance their effectiveness as academic leaders, role models, and mentors
to future generations of health professionals.  The program seeks to
provide participants with knowledge and skills necessary to develop
innovative programs in clinical care, research, education and advocacy and
to take leadership roles at their institutions and nationally.  It aims to
develop an intellectually vibrant, mutually supportive, and
cross-fertilizing network of colleagues involved in multiple facets of
work with the dying and survivors of loss.  Interaction among the fellows
will foster new interdisciplinary approaches to key issues related to
death in America. <p>

<center><h2>SPECIAL DRUG POLICY SEMINAR SERIES CONTINUES</h2><br> 
<h3>Fall 1996<p>
 
<i>DRUG TREATMENT RECONSIDERED:<br> 
HARM REDUCTION PERSPECTIVES</h3></i></center> 
<p> 
<hr>
<p>
 
The Lindesmith Center continues its special seminar series on the relationship between drug treatment 
and harm reduction. Harm reduction services focus on reducing the negative consequences of drug use among those unwilling or unable to abstain. Traditional drug services - including methadone maintenance and drug free modalities - have focused on attaining abstinence from all illicit drugs. Though the objectives of harm reduction and drug treatment services often seem at odds with one another, there is increasing evidence in the US and abroad that they can be successfully integrated. These seminars will take a new look at drug treatment from a harm reduction perspective, examining current approaches and asking how the scope of treatment services can be broadened, how services can become more accessible, and how they must be altered to achieve harm reduction goals. 
<p> 
With the exception of presentations on foreign treatment models, sessions will be structured as discussions 
between treatment providers and their patients, patient advocates, and drug users. These special seminars 
will run through late-1996, with future subjects including rapid outpatient heroin detox, controlled drinking 
therapy, and research on new developments in methadone provision. 
<p> 
<p>
<i>Wednesday, December 4, 4:00pm</i><br>
<b>Controlled drinking therapy as harm reduction:  From character assassination to acceptance?</b><br>
Clinicians have long noted that some alcohol misusers recover their ability to drink moderately.  Yet the need for absolute abstinence is a basic tenet of most alcoholism treatment in the United States.  Recently, controlled drinking therapy has gained more acceptance as a "brief intervention," but it continues to face opposition.  This session is a joint presentation by Stanton Peele, Ph.D., a therapist and author on addiction and treatment issues, and Fred Rotgers, Psy.D., director of the Program for Addictions Consultation and Treatment at St. Peter's Medical Center and head of a brief intervention program at the Rutgers Center on Alcohol Studies.
<p>
<i>Tuesday, December 10, 4:00pm</i><br>
<b>Expanding the boundaries of drug treatment</b><br>
Howard Josepher, CSW, discusses the development of harm reduction-oriented services within the framework of drug treatment.  Drawing on his experience with therapeutic communities and other more traditional drug treatment services, Mr. Josepher will talk about creating a new type of treatment program, which focuses on skills-building and wellness for active drug users as well as those in treatment and recovery.  Joined by clients and staff from his program ARRIVE, Mr. Josepher will speculate on the future of drug treatment and the role of harm reduction.

TAJIK FIGHTING
<P>
  
<P>
VOA  2/9/96
<P>
intro:   government troops in tajikistan have halted an advance

<P>
by islamic rebels in the mountains east of the capital, dushanbe.

<P>
peter heinlein reports from v-o-a's moscow bureau.
<P>
     
<P>
text:   a tajik government spokesman friday said the rebels 
<P>
retreated after a fierce battle outside the town of tavildara,

<P>
200 kilometers east of dushanbe.  tajik army troops were reported

<P>
to have retaken a strategic bridge on the main road to the 
<P>
capital.
<P>
details of the battle were sketchy, and could _not_ be 
<P>
independently confirmed.  tavildara is in a sparsely populated

<P>
mountainous region of central tajikistan.
<P>
political analysts say the opposition guerrillas are muslims who

<P>
fled to neighboring afghanistan after tajikistan's 1992 civil
war. 
<P>
 the guerrillas launched an offensive last week, at the same time

<P>
two mutinous warlords staged an uprising in western tajikistan,

<P>
demanding the dismissal of allegedly corrupt
<P>
     
<P>
officials
<P>
the warlords called off their action after the government 
<P>
accepted their demands.  and one of the former rebellious 
<P>
factions this week joined the government troops in battling the

<P>
islamic rebels.
<P>
russia maintains about 25-thousand peacekeeping troops in 
<P>
tajikistan and has said its soldiers will remain neutral.  but

<P>
the reuter news agency friday reported russian fighter jets and

<P>
military helicopters have been seen taking off from the dushanbe

<P>
airport in the past few days.
<P>
the reuter report said a tajik government official had declined

<P>
to say whether russian troops participated in the battle outside

<P>
tavildara.  (signed)

<h2>
Visit Myanmar Year - If You Can
</h2>
The Nation/26.12.95
<P>
     
<P>
        Slorc takes Suu Kyi off the list of tourist attractions,
<P>
                            Aung Zaw writes.
<P>
     
<P>
Visit Myanmar Year 1996, the Burmese military's ambitious tourism

<P>
promotion campaign, has gotten off to an inauspicious start with

<P>
two tour group being banned from the country and other visitors

<P>
complaining of being harassed by military officials.
<P>
     
<P>
The message from the Burma appears to be that the country's arms

<P>
are open to visitors, but it prefers those who are prepared to

<P>
stay in their hotels and only emerge for controlled sightseeing

<P>
tours.
<P>
     
<P>
In January and February, Tourism Minister Lt Gen Kyaw Ba twice

<P>
refused to grant landing rights to tour groups from the United

<P>
States. As a result, approximately 100 visitors from the Stanford

<P>
Alumni Association and 70 from its Michigan counterpart planning

<P>
to visit Burma were turned away.
<P>
     
<P>
The American tourists had been issued visas and were planning
to 
<P>
stay two nights in Rangoon and take a day excursion to Pagan to

<P>
see the &quot;Golden Land&quot;. But they never made it.
<P>
     
<P>
The trouble begin in late December.
<P>
     
<P>
New-Horizons, the Rangoon-based travel agency helping arrange
the 
<P>
two groups, receiving a note from Kyaw Ba saying their chartered

<P>
flight would be denied permission to land. The reason given was

<P>
that the ruling junta, known as State Law and Order Restoration

<P>
Council(Slorc), had discovered that both groups were seeking to

<P>
set up a meeting with opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize

<P>
winner Aung San Suu Kyi during their visit to Rangoon.
<P>
     
<P>
According to sources in Washington, Duncan Beardsley, director
of 
<P>
traveling programmes at the stanford Alumni assiciation, sent
a 
<P>
letter to Suu Kyi in November, inviting Suu Kyi to meet with the

<P>
Stanford graduates.
<P>
     
<P>
But on December 22, Beardsley, apparently realizing his request

<P>
would jeopardize the group's travel plans, wrote back to Suu Kyi

<P>
saying he was withdrawing his invitation due to unforeseen 
<P>
circumstances.
<P>
     
<P>
At the same time Beardsley wrote to Tin Tun at New Horizons, 
<P>
saying&quot;...I innocently sent the invitation not understanding
the 
<P>
impact of any action. He said his group had no political agenda

<P>
whatsoever while visiting Burma. I wish to emphasize in no 
<P>
uncertain terms that neither I nor any of the passengers or staff

<P>
will contact this person [Suu Kyi].&quot;
<P>
     
<P>
It seemed as if wanting to see Suu Kyi had become a crime. 
<P>
Abercrombie and Kent(A&amp;K), a Hong Kong- based travel agency
also 
<P>
making arrangements for the trip petitioned Rangoon, promising

<P>
&quot;100 per cent&quot; that neither group would visit with the
opposition 
<P>
leader who was released in July 1995.
<P>
     
<P>
A&amp;K's patrick Macleod sent a note to Tin Tun. It looks like
the 
<P>
guy at Stanford has sent a letter to Aung San Suu Kyi asking her

<P>
to speak to the group. Anyway, he now realises what a mistake
he 
<P>
has made.&quot;
<P>
     
<P>
Sources associated with the tour the US said, &quot;The appeal
from 
<P>
Stanford was turned down and they are going to Phnon Penh 
<P>
instead. But Michigan's appeal was upheld &quot;because there
was no 
<P>
written proof Michigan had tried to arrange a meeting with Suu

<P>
Kyi or to present her with an award,&quot; said the source.
<P>
     
<P>
Simon Billenness an analyst at Boston based Franklin Research
and 
<P>
Development said: Western proponents of tourism in Burma claimed

<P>
that tourism in Burma will open up the country to new ideas. The

<P>
Slorc's refusal to allow tourists to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi

<P>
shows that the Slorc wants tourists to just bring  hard currency

<P>
and leave any new ideas at home.&quot; Sources in Bangkok and

<P>
Washington said Rangoon's moves were likely to boost the anti-

<P>
Rangoon sentiment on campuses around the United States.
<P>
     
<P>
For their part, Burmese officials are planning to ask visitors

<P>
who they are going to meet in Rangoon. Even for those foreigners

<P>
who do make it into the country, their hassles with officialdom

<P>
are not over, returning visitors have said. Dianne Guest, a 
<P>
regular visitor of Burma for the last three years, was detained

<P>
in early January with a group of American and British companion

<P>
in Magwe.
<P>
     
<P>
Speaking in Bangkok, Guest said she was exhausted and angry as
a 
<P>
result of being detained and treated unpleasantly by Burmese 
<P>
Authorities. Guest and her friends had been travelling around
the 
<P>
country by bicycle. They were stopped in Magwe, about 100 km out

<P>
of Rangoon, and asked if they had permission to be on the road.
<P>
     
<P>
They were told it was illegal to independently. &quot;There is
law,&quot; a 
<P>
Burmese official said. When the foreigners replied they had never

<P>
been told about the law, the Burmese official told them &quot;It
is a 
<P>
secret law&quot;. Finally Guest and her friends were forced to
fly 
<P>
back to Rangoon. They made an appointment to see Kyaw Ba but the

<P>
Tourism minister failed to show up for the meeting. Other 
<P>
tourists have similarly complained they were followed and 
<P>
harassed by military intelligence officers.
<P>
     
<P>
Reliable sources said foreign officials visiting Burma have been

<P>
told to decide on Suu Kyi or Slorc.
<P>
     
<P>
They are not allowed to see both, but of course a lot of people

<P>
don't want to see the Slorc anyway, said an American activists.

<h2>
Burma: BBC Interviews Aung San Suu Kyi on Economic Policies
</h2>
BK0202025096 London BBC in Burmese to Burma 1345 GMT 30 Jan 96
<P>
[Interview by telephone with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi of the National
League for 
Democracy and leader of the opposition in Rangoon by U Than Lwin
Tun from 
the BBC Burmese Section-recorded]
<P>
[FBIS Translated Text] [Begin recording] [Than Lwin Tun] The first
thing I want 
to know is Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's opinion on the SLORC [State
Law and 
Order Restoration Council] military government's economic policies,
especially 
their claims that economic development was on a sustainable upward
track and 
would eventually lead to the country's democratization.
<P>
[Aung San Suu Kyi] First, I would like to ask what they mean by
sustainable 
economic development. As far as we can see, a small group of rich
people in the 
country are getting richer, but the majority of the people are
facing great 
economic difficulties. So, we don't see this as economic development,
because if 
there is economic development in a country, there should also
be equality; there 
should be development in every strata of life. If only a small
group gets richer, 
the gap will widen between those who have money and those who
do not have 
money, between the rich and the poor. We believe that this widening
gap will 
affect economic development and cause social unrest in the long
term.
<P>
[Than Lwin Tun] So, you mean to say that this is not the correct
way for the 
country's democratization.
<P>
[Aung San Suu Kyi] How can a country based on these kinds of inequalities
achieve a stable democracy? The present economic policies do not
give equal 
rights to all. Moreover, these policies do not direct the necessary
assistance and 
funds to the general public, who need them the most.
<P>
[Than Lwin Tun] Another point I want to raise concerns foreign
investment. 
Yesterday, Trade Minister Lieutenant General Tun Kyi said at a
seminar 
sponsored by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission
for Asia and Pacific that he believed Burma's economy will skyrocket
if it could 
get substantial financial and technical cooperation from abroad.
What would you 
like to say on this?
<P>
[Aung San Suu Kyi] This matter is related to what I have said
earlier. On 
investment, it depends on the nature of the investment. It would
be a different 
matter if the investment really benefited the whole country, if
the investment 
really lift the standards of the needy and deprived populace.
As I said earlier, I 
think investments that widen the gap between the rich and the
poor will not be 
beneficial for the country.
<P>
[Than Lwin Tun] What about investments concerning the construction
of roads 
and bridges. Don't you think these will benefit the poor of Burma?
<P>
[Aung San Suu Kyi] They are mentioning investments for transportation,
but the 
people have to contribute volunteer labor for the construction
of roads. This is 
also very widely known. But, in building these roads -it is nice
to have good 
roads-the people have to invest their sweat, poverty, and misery.
<P>
[Than Lwin Tun] Apart from investments from private companies
and other 
individual governments, is the present Burmese military regime
getting any aid or 
assistance from international financial institutions such as the
International 
Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank?
<P>
[Aung San Suu Kyi] As far as I know, they have not received any
such assistance. 
There are many requirements, fundamental requirements, for a country
to 
develop and to enjoy sustainable economic growth. The most important
fundamental requirement is the rule of law, because the trust
and security needed 
for economic development can exist only if there is rule of law.
That is why, we 
would like to stress that the political system, the legal system,
and the economic 
system all go together; they are inseparable.
<P>
[Than Lwin Tun] Regarding the present rule of law situation, the
SLORC [State 
Law and Order Restoration Council] government has claimed that
they have 
managed to restore law and order. What is your opinion on that?
<P>
[Aung San Suu Kyi] Our opinion is that the people are not meant
to be quiet, 
submissive, pressed, and flattened [literal translation of vernacular
term for law 
and order]. The legal system should accommodate a sense of happiness
and 
security for the people. We believe that just laws that provide
happiness and 
security for the people should be strongly preserved.
<P>
[Than Lwin Tun] What about investments. Do you think this is not
the right time 
to invest in Burma? And why?
<P>
[Aung San Suu Kyi] As I mentioned earlier, the present investments
do not benefit 
the citizens; moreover, we believe that these investments will
also not benefit the 
investors in the long term. I say this because some economic observers
that have 
no connections with us have said that if no necessary changes
are made at this 
time, you cannot achieve sustainable economic development in the
long term, no 
matter how much investments you make. What the economic observers
noted 
included the rule of law, which I had mentioned earlier-the need
of a secure and 
strong legal system that clearly protects economic enterprises.
<P>
[Than Lwin Tun] Can we accept what you have just said as the economic
policy 
of the National League for Democracy [NLD].
<P>
[Aung San Suu Kyi] I have written an article about our economic
policies. BBC 
will know what our economic policies are when the article is published.
These 
economic policies are the ones that we campaigned for in the 1990
elections. But 
since the status of the NLD was changed in July 1990, we were
unable to print 
and distribute these policies to the masses. [end recording]

<P>
<I><B>About this Report:</B></I>
<P>
<I>SAIN would like to thank the many people responsible for this
report.</I>
<P>
<I>We would also like to acknowledge the dedication and hard work
of the many physicians, nurses, and public health staff attempting
to control the HIV epidemic in Burma.  Their efforts are remarkable,
and they deserve both praise and support.  Much of the information
in this report is either published in the medical literature,
or has been presented at scientific conferences.  Some of the
data, while confirmed by multiple sources, has not been approved
for release by the authorities in Burma.  SAIN would like to point
out that while these data have been collected by official sources
in Burma, the tight control on information in the country has
impeded the spread of this vital information to the Burmese people
themselves, and to those concerned with Burma's future.  SAIN
emphatically affirms that no medical personnel or staff of any
official agency in Burma shared these data with us, they were
leaked by sources which cannot be named.  </I>
<P>
<I>We would further like to state that our goal in publishing
this report is not to compromise those already working to halt
the spread of AIDS in Burma, but rather to move the debate on
international involvement forward such that HIV/AIDS programs
of real benefit to the people of Burma can be mounted.  It is
in this spirit that we sincerely apologize for any and all negative
repercussions this report may have on people inside Burma.</I>
<P>
<I>The report has several objectives.  It attempts to summarize
what is known, and what information SAIN has collected, on the
current status of the HIV epidemic in Burma.  The policy implications
of HIV control under the SLORC regime are explored.  Lastly, policy
options for control of the HIV epidemic for potential donors and
organizations concerned about the HIV epidemic are suggested.
 We hope this report is read, used, and debated.  The people of
Burma face many challenges, HIV is just one of them, but it has
the potential to add a great deal more suffering and hardship
to the lives of an already embattled and struggling people.</I>

<P>
The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Southeast and South Asia began later
than in Africa and the West.  Since the introduction of the HIV
virus into this densely populated region, however, the spread
of the epidemic has been explosive, and public health and community
responses have varied widely.  The Global Programme on AIDS of
the World Health Organization has identified the four hardest
hit countries in the Asian region, they are, in order of HIV prevalence;
India, Thailand, Burma (Myanmar), and Cambodia.(1)   While information
on the HIV epidemic in Burma is limited, for a variety of reasons,
it is clear that HIV has spread extensively in the country and
that the HIV epidemic will have major impacts on the peoples of
Burma, their health care system, and their future economic development.

<P>
 
<P>
Estimates of the HIV burden in Burma are relatively crude, and
vary considerably, but 350,000 to 450,000 persons infected as
of 1995 is probably reasonable, and is currently within the range
used by the Myanmar National AIDS Program (NAP).  HIV/AIDS education,
prevention, and care programs are currently inadequate in Burma,
and more are urgently needed.  Medical supplies are in short supply,
and their distribution is markedly uneven, making blood and blood
products transfusion unsafe, especially in rural areas, and even
minor procedures HIV transmission risks.  Burma has another epidemic--injecting
drug use, which preceded the HIV explosion in the country, and
which will make control difficult to achieve.  Condoms were illegal
in Burma until 1992, are scarce, little used, and expensive, making
sexual transmission of HIV a major, and equally difficult to control
transmission route.  Perinatal spread, from infected mothers to
infants, is rapidly increasing as a result of sexual transmission
to women in Burma. 
<P>
International organizations, several UN agencies, donor governments,
private foundations, NGOs, and research groups are already playing
key roles in attempts to control the HIV epidemics in Thailand
and India.  A number of these organizations including The Global
program on AIDS of the World Health Organization, UNICEF, Medecins
Sans Frontiers, and NGOs such as The International Red Cross,
CARE and World Vision already have programs underway in Burma,
and others are currently considering such involvement.  Collaborative
research projects with at least one American University have been
established, and others are proposed.  While these efforts are
laudable, and are clearly necessary, there are crucial political
and social realities in Burma, which make a careful examination
of such involvement  essential.    
<P>
Burma is currently controlled by a military government known as
the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC).  SLORC refused
to honor the results of Burma's democratic election in 1990, and
has killed, jailed or driven into exile virtually all the countrs'
elected leaders.  Totalitarian repression and violence are rife.
 The SLORC has one of the world's worst human rights records,
and has few friends (with the notable exceptions of Burma's Southeast
Asian neighbors, Japan, and China) and has no popular support.
 Information is tightly controlled, and there is heavy censorship
of all media.  Freedom of speech, assembly, and of the press,
are denied to Burmese citizens.  Any organization attempting to
assist in HIV/AIDS programs in Burma must consider these realities.
<P>
II. <U><B>Current Status of the Epidemic</B></U>
<P>
1. <U>Injecting Drug Use and HIV</U>
<P>
The first HIV screening programs in Burma were initiated in 1985,
by the military government of General Ne Win, which preceded the
SLORC regime.  No cases were detected until 1988, when the first
injecting drug users (IDU) with HIV were found in Rangoon (Yangon).(2)

<P>
It is estimated that now Burma produces more than 50% of the world's
raw heroin.  While most of the drug is sold abroad, Burma has
a little acknowledged but widespread domestic heroin market. 
Rangoon, Mandalay, and the other cities and towns of Burma under
central government control have large numbers of IDUs, although
estimates are very rough.  Some rural and ethnic areas, notably
the Kachin State, also have large drug user communities.  The
government estimate in 1994 was that perhaps 1% of adult of men
nationwide were active injecting drug users.(3)  An earlier estimate
was that 4% of adult men were involved in this behavior.(3)  Even
the lower estimate suggests a grave situation in terms of potential
HIV spread.  An unpublished UN report estimated that in early
1994, 60-70% of all IDUs in Burma had HIV.(4)  The figures for
specific cities included 74% in Rangoon, 84% in Mandalay, and
91% in Myitkyina, the capital of Kachin State on the Burma-China
border.  Data collected by the NAP confirm these findings.(5)
 These rates are summarized in Table 1.  
<P>
The explanation for the very high rates of HIV infection among
drug users in Burma is almost certainly due to needle sharing;
the principal risk behavior for HIV infection among addicts worldwide.
 It is currently illegal to possess syringes, except for medical
purposes, and they  are in extremely short supply, making needle
sharing a daily reality.(4)  Professional injectors work in &quot;tea
stall&quot; shooting galleries, reusing needles and transmitting
HIV on a daily basis.  In remote areas, addicts often make crude
injecting equipment at home, further promoting HIV spread.  Sharing
of injecting equipment is also known to spread other blood-borne
infectious pathogens, notably Hepatitis B and C viruses, syphilis,
and malaria (an endemic infection in much of Burma).  
<P>
The HIV epidemic among injecting drug users in Burma has created
a further epidemic problem; spread to drug users in at least two
of Burma's border nations, China and India.  The Burma-China border
zone, which on the China side is comprised of the Province of
Yunnan, and on the Burma of the Kachin and Shan States, is currently
the highest prevalence zone for HIV infection in The People's
Republic of China.(6)  The Chinese Ministry of Health recently
reported that 80.4% (1426/1774) of all HIV infections in China
were detected in Yunnan, and 60.0% of all confirmed AIDS cases.(6)
 The HIV infection rate in the Chinese border district of Ruili,
across from Kachin state, was 62% among injecting drug users in
1994.(6)  The majority of these drug users were ethnic Kachin
(Jingpo in Chinese) and Wa.(7)  
<P>
Burma's western border with India is the Chin state, where HIV
testing has not been initiated.  However, drug users on the Indian
side, in the border state of Manipur have among the highest rates
of infection in India.  WHO estimates from September, 1994, suggested
that the HIV infection rate among drug users in Manipur State
was 56%.(8)  This epidemic has spread rapidly to the general population.(9)
 Taken together, these two border epidemics are evidence that
Burma, in addition to being a net heroin exporter, is also an
exporter of HIV infection.  
<P>
In an authoritarian state, where government control of virtually
all sectors of economic and social life is the norm, the high
rates of heroin use among Burma's youth point either to a fundamental
inability of the government to exert control, or an involvement,
at least on some levels, of the government in heroin availability.
 In either case, the failure of the SLORC to effectively address
the IV drug use problem bodes ill for their ability to cope with
AIDS.  Furthermore, the epidemic of injecting drug use has become
an important issue for Burma's neighbors, and will affect their
ability to control the HIV/AIDS epidemic. 
<P>
2. Blood and Blood Products, and Medical Procedures
<P>
Making the blood supply safe has been a priority of the public
health community in Burma, and progress has been made, but the
supply is far from safe, even in urban centers.  In the rural
areas blood and blood products are still often transfused without
testing; in two of Burma's fourteen states routinely so.  The
NAP estimates that at best about 65% of blood and blood products
are properly screened, but the bulk of this screening has been
in Rangoon (Yangon).(10)  
<P>
HIV testing costs are a limitation on blood screening, but there
are other barriers as well.  Blood safety in 1995 begins in virtually
country with donor deferral.  Potential blood donors with known
risk for HIV infection (drug use, a recent STD, male homosexuals,
sex workers, etc.) are usually screened out of donation by questions
before their blood is ever taken.  This is complicated in Burma
by widespread fear of arrest (for example among gay/bisexual man,
sex workers, addicts, and men visiting sex workers.)  Health personnel,
aware of the risk to donors by having such &quot;crimes&quot;
admitted on their medical records, usually avoid asking these
questions.  The result is that blood enters the donation pool
which should never have been collected, and testing costs are
driven needlessly high.
<P>
Because so many pregnant women in Burma (in rural areas and among
the urban poor) are anemic due to poor nutrition, and because
prenatal care is so limited, transfusions after delivery are much
more common in Burma than in developed nations, compounding the
transfusion problem.  
<P>
Despite several recent cease-fire agreements with ethnic groups
there is still active fighting in the Shan States, in the Karenni
area, with the Karen National Union, and in some western mountainous
regions.  Battlefield conditions in all these areas are unsanitary
and these are clearly HIV transmission risk zones.  While data
on these areas is limited, interviews with physicians working
in these areas confirm that blood is not tested before transfusion,
needles and syringes are in critically short supply, and exposure
to blood and body fluids in field hospitals is the norm, not the
exception, for patients and health care workers alike.  
<P>
Repeated use of blood collection equipment in prisons, on battlefields,
and even in under equipped medical facilities in other sectors,
may make <I>blood donation</I> a risk for HIV infection, although
the extent of this problem is impossible to quantify.
<P>
3. Heterosexual Transmission and the Commercial Sex Trade
<P>
Little is known about the commercial sex trade in Burma proper,
though it is thought to be less extensive than in Thailand.  HIV
infection rates among commercial sex workers (CSW) in 1994 were
high, at an average of perhaps 17%, but widespread testing has
not been done.(See Table 3.)  Men who visit prostitutes can be
charged under British penal codes which make use of prostitutes
equivalent to rape, and carry up to ten year prison sentences.(Personal
Communication to SAIN)  Careers and reputations can be ruined
by such charges.  These stiff penalties have driven commercial
sex deep underground.  A recent international consultant to Burma
told SAIN this:  
<P>
 There are few formal &quot;brothels&quot; as such, because these
are too easily detected.  Instead, men typically contact pimps,
who then bring girls to their cars.  Several men will usually
share one woman for a night, with some finding the women, and
others identifying a room to use.  Each man in the group then
has a &quot;turn&quot; of sex with the sex worker.  This informal
and fluid system of commercial sex makes education and outreach
to the women involved virtually impossible.
<P>
A major focus of HIV infection among CSWs is the large Shan States
region of eastern Burma.  Currently at war with the SLORC, the
Shan States are controlled by local leaders, opium trade is extensive,
and poverty is marked.  This high level of social unrest has helped
to produce a major traffic in Shan women and girls for the Thai
sex industry.  Between 25% to 35% of women entering the sex industry
in northern Thailand are Shan migrants.(Personal communication,
Chiang Mai health authorities)  In this region, between 40-60%
of all women working in brothels have HIV infection, and perhaps
80% of all women trafficked into the industry will acquire HIV.(11)
 Women returning from the Thai sex industry with HIV have been
found in Yunnan Province, China, in the Shan States, and in Central
Burma.(11)  In addition, Thai brothel recruiters are active in
the ethnic Akha, Lahu, and Lisu tribal areas of the Thai-Burma
border, and a significant number of women and girls in the Thai
sex trade are from these areas.(12)
<P>
The southern Tenasserim region (Ye Township) of Burma is also
a major trafficking area for Burmese women and girls.  These women
typically work in closed (locked) brothels  in the extensive sex
industry of Thailand's Ranong area. (11)  This region has the
highest HIV rates after northern Thailand, and again, the great
majority of these women have, or will have, HIV before their time
in Thailand is over.  Kawthaung, on the Burma side of the border
across from Ranong, has some of the highest HIV rates in the country,
suggested two-way spread of this rapid epidemic.(Personal communication
to SAIN)
<P>
Heterosexual spread outside the commercial area is also not well
described, but sexually transmitted disease clinic data is available.
 STD clinic users in Burma have alarmingly high rates of HIV.
 These are summarized in Table 2.  
<P>
It is striking that the highest rates among women attending STD
clinics were not found in Rangoon, where we might expect such
rates, but in Myitkyina, suggesting that heterosexual transmission
from male addicts to their female sex partners may already be
widespread.  Since the majority of Burma's injecting addicts are
young men, there is obvious potential for sexual spread from these
men to their wives, girlfriends, and other sex partners.  
<P>
The majority of women using contraceptives in Burma have IUDs
(intra-uterine devices).  These are inexpensive and effective,
but are increasingly problematic in the HIV era.  They may <I>increase</I>
a woman's risk of HIV infection, by increasing the risk of both
cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).  IUDs may also
discourage condom use in couples, since the woman is already &quot;protected&quot;
from unwanted pregnancy.
<P>
4. Homosexual/bisexual exposure to HIV 
<P>
Sex between adult men is illegal in Burma, and is still subject
to punishment under the 1880's British penal code, for which sodomy
carries a sentence of lifetime banishment to offshore penal colonies
in the Andaman Sea.(Personal Communication to SAIN)  The location
and current population, if any, of these penal areas, is unknown.
 While public health authorities in Burma suggest that these punishments
are rarely enforced, the legal and social status of men who have
sex with men is such this group is largely underground, and difficult
to access.  No specific gay or bisexual studies have been done.
 However, a recent anonymous survey of sexual behavior among soldiers
in the Burmese Army reported that 7.4% of recruits admitted to
having had sex with another man.(13)  Given the low levels of
condom use, the isolation of gay and bisexual Burmese from informed
communities abroad, and the underground nature of same sex behavior
under the current regime, it is likely, but unconfirmed, that
high risk sexual behavior is common among these men.
<P>
Male commercial sex workers, common in India, Sri Lanka, Thailand,
the Philippines and Cambodia, are undocumented in Burma.  Male
sex workers from Burma, however, have been found working in several
sex establishments in Thailand, suggesting that these behaviors,
or the potential for them, may also exist in Burma.(14)  As in
any population, this is an outgrowth of poverty.
<P>
5. Ethnic Minorities, Border States and Migrant labor
<P>
The many border regions of Burma, including a number of areas
not under SLORC control and in active (in several cases armed)
resistance, have been little studied in terms of HIV, with the
exception of the Shan State areas under government control, and
Kachin State.  The two States in the Union which have not yet
started any HIV testing are the large Chin State, and the Kayah
State, ethnically largely Karen.  Since no HIV testing is available
in these regions, it is clear that any and all blood transfusions
in these areas are HIV transmission risks.  
<P>
Trafficking of women occurs across several of these regions, with
the most significant areas being the Shan States and the Southern
areas of Kawthaung.(11)  Sex workers, or women and girls trafficked
into sex work are, however, far outnumbered by migrant Burmese
workers.  This population is impossible to quantify with certainty,
being undocumented, illegal, and vulnerable to arrest and re-patriation
in the host countries.  The Royal Thai Ministry of the Interior
estimated that in 1994 there were 334,000 illegal Burmese workers
in Thailand, making Burma largest single source of illegal labor
in the country.(15)  This figure is thought to be conservative.(15)
 Malaysia officially reports fewer than 10,000, but NGOs working
with migrants in Malaysia suggest the figure may be closer to
50,000.(Personal communication to SAIN)  This population is involved
in manual labor, mostly road and building construction, domestic
labor, agriculture, logging, fishing, and trading.(15)  The great
majority of these workers are men, most are young, and most are
without their wives and families, all factors that have led to
rapid HIV spread in other similar populations worldwide. 
<P>
HIV risks for illegal workers are many and varied.  They are largely
closed off to educational materials in the host country, due to
language barriers and lack of access to media.  Possession of
literature in Burmese or ethnic languages can be used as evidence
of being foreign, and lead to arrest.  Workers are usually too
afraid of arrest to use Government STD and HIV facilities in host
countries, and untreated STDs have been found in many illegal
female workers.(16)  Poverty is another barrier, and almost precludes
condom use. 
<P>
Many worksites in Thailand now have a new class of sex workers;
women who work not in brothels, but out of housing near temporary
construction sites.(Personal Communication, Empower)  These sex
workers travel with the construction teams, and are not, therefore
accessible to the Thai health workers who's mandate is to treat
their STDS, educate them about HIV prevention, and provide them
with condoms.  This new &quot;floating&quot; population of CSWs
will make HIV prevention among illegal workers especially difficult.
<P>
Migrant labor within Burma is a further problem.  For the last
several years mining camps have sprung up in the Shan States and
in the Kachin State.  These makeshift mining communities are seasonal;
they may have only a few thousand workers in the rainy season,
but 100,000 to 150,000 and more in the drier months.(17)  The
miners dig for jade, rubies, other gemstones, ores and metals.
 Sanitation in this huge temporary camps is crude or non-existent,
and there are reports that drug use and prostitution are widespread.
 One Burmese physician reported to SAIN that the majority of his
HIV infected patients had become heroin users while working in
temporary jade mines.  Because these workers are from all over
the country, the potential for HIV spread after their return home
may be great.  Indeed, without such extensive population movements
it would be almost impossible to explain the rapid and pervasive
spread of the virus across such a large and diverse country.
<P>
6. Prison Populations
<P>
Little is known about medical practices in Burma's extensive prison
system.  It is known, however, that prisoners have been used for
blood donation, and that donation drawing equipment is re-used
repeatedly, insuring that if HIV is present, and it undoubtedly
is, the spread in prisons will be extensive.(Personal communication,
SLORC defectors)  Reading materials of any kind are banned in
Burma's prisons, limiting any educational efforts.(4)  Condoms
are not provided, as sex in prisons is a further crime under the
still active British penal code, ensuring that any sex which does
occur in prisons is unsafe.(Personal Communication)
<P>
There are also large populations under arrest, detention, or captivity
but not in formal prisons or jails.  These include persons subjected
to forced labor, porters, refugees in detention centers, and others.
 Health conditions among this large, fluid, and difficult to document
population are known to be extremely poor.  There is no data on
HIV infections, or HIV risks, such as unsafe medical practices,
or forced and unprotected sex, among this population.  Reports
of rape by soldiers and police committed against women in these
forced labor situations are, however, well documented.(18)  
<P>
7. The Military Population
<P>
One study of HIV infection risks among men in the Burmese military
has been reported.(13)  Risk behaviors were common, and included
sex with other men (7.4%), extra-marital sex (13%), sex with CSWs
(37.3%) and inconsistent or absent condom use (96.6).(13)  HIV
rates were comparatively low, at less than 2% overall; syphilis
prevalence was slightly higher, at 2.5%.(13)  This is somewhat
lower than among other populations of young men sampled in Burma
(see Tables 1. and 2.1), but may reflect the relatively young
age of soldiers, who may enter the military as young as 15 years,
and therefore may have little lifetime risk.
<P>
AIDS education is offered to soldiers, but condom promotion and
distribution is not a significant part of this program. 
<P>
8. Perinatal Transmission
<P>
In the model used to generate the 375,000 HIV infections figure
now used by the NAP, fully 175,000 of these cases were among women
attending pre-natal care clinics.  This large estimate is due
to the fact that data on pregnant women is probably more reliable
than for other groups for two reasons; estimating the number of
pregnant women is much easier than estimating, say, the number
of addicts; pregnant women usually have blood draws as part of
routine care, so HIV sampling is much more valid.  This estimate
of 175,000, therefore, is probably fairly accurate.  It suggests
however, that the other figures are much too low:  it is unlikely
that so many &quot;low-risk&quot; women could be infected without
a very large number of married men.
<P>
AZT, which has been shown to markedly reduce the risk of HIV transmission
from an infected mother to infant, in unavailable in Burma, except
to those who can pay through the private system.(Personal communication
to SAIN)
<P>
 
<P>
9. <U>Care for People with HIV/AIDS</U>
<P>
The first report in the medical literature on clinical AIDS cases
in Burma was published in 1993 (2).  The patients were seen at
Yangon General Hospital between 1991 and 1992.  Most were IDU,
and most were men.   Virtually all presented not with the usual
opportunistic infections seen in developed countries, but with
tropical infectious diseases like salmonellosis and tuberculosis,
suggesting an AIDS case pattern more akin to that in underdeveloped
regions of Africa than that of the west.(19)   A recent article
on clinical care for people with AIDS found that treatment was
essentially non-existent, and patients succumbed quickly to infections
(20).
<P>
Tuberculosis will be a special problem in Burma, due to high TB
exposure rates in the general population, and the infectious nature
of TB, even for healthy HIV negative subjects.  Given the cost
of antibiotic therapy for this disease, TB threatens to consume
a significant portion of the health care budget, and this will
undoubtedly increase as the large numbers of HIV Infected persons
in Burma progress to AIDS.
<P>
In sum, the Burmese HIV epidemic is widespread and growing rapidly,
it involves several transmission routes including IDU, sexual
transmission, unsafe medical practices, and unscreened blood and
blood products.  The epidemic of domestic heroin use has been
a key factor in the HIV explosion; the sex industry is another
factor, but only one of several, in the Burmese HIV epidemic.
 Prevention efforts are beginning, but treatment and care are
extremely limited. 
<P>
<U><B>III.</B></U><B> <U>Control Programs</U></B>
<P>
 Government Responses
<P>
1. The Blood Supply
<P>
Screening of blood and blood products for HIV has been a priority
of the NAP since 1992.  The program and has been steadily trying
to increase blood screening, starting in the major cities and
attempting to improve services in smaller towns and rural areas.
 Lack of resources has been the major constraint, and the difficulties
of HIV testing in remote and combat areas has compounded the problem.
 The 1995 estimate is that perhaps 2/3 of the blood supply is
safe, and 1/3 remains an HIV risk, but all sources admit that
this figure is uncertain.
<P>
Universal precautions, the worldwide guidelines on handling of
infectious body fluids, surgical equipment, and syringes, have
not been adopted nationwide, again, largely due to lack of resources.
 In addition, about 80% of physicians work in the poorly monitored
private sector, and implementation of universal precautions in
this large sector is an unknown.  Burma has a long tradition of
excellently trained physicians; at independence it probably had
the best medical services in the region.  While physicians may
be largely aware of the risks of HIV transmission, the expense
of using disposable equipment, and of universal precautions in
general, are likely to prohibit even the best private practitioners
from consistent good medical practices.
<P>
The NAP has also expended considerable efforts in trying to characterize
the HIV epidemic.  Sentinel surveillance among high risk groups
has been ongoing since 1992, and now includes male and female
STD patients, sex workers, injecting drug users, pregnant women,
blood donors, and military recruits.  This information has been
invaluable in terms of understanding the gravity of the situation.
 It will also be essential for prevention efforts.  These efforts,
in general, are either just beginning or in development.  Interventions
that are urgently needed include:
<P>
 Injecting drug users
<P>
  education about needle sharing at the grass roots level
<P>
  needle exchange programs to remove infected needles from the
population
<P>
  expanded drug treatment and counseling
<P>
  education about harm reduction including needle cleaning and
works cleaning
<P>
  repeal of laws punishing addicts for needle possession
<P>
  sexual prevention counseling and condom distribution for addicts
<P>
  
<P>
<B>The fundamental issue of the large supply of cheap and available
heroin throughout the country must be addressed.  Without control
of the heroin epidemic in Burma, the HIV epidemic is unlikely
to be contained.</B>
<P>
 Sexual Transmission
<P>
Condoms are available in most big cities, but they are expensive
by Burmese standards.  A packet of 12 costs from 120-750 Jyat
(many nationals make less than 1,000 Jyat/month.)  Traditional
cultural barriers to open of discussion of sexuality and sexual
behavior will make increasing condom use difficult in Burma. 
 
<P>
  condom availability must be rapidly increased
<P>
  culturally specific condom promotion programs are needed
<P>
  condom cost, either through Govt supports or local manufacture,
must be    reduced
<P>
  condom distribution should be a part of family planning services,
STD services,    and education in their use must be provided
<P>
  STD control efforts are underway, but need to be expanded
<P>
  confidentiality of STD results must be assured 
<P>
  discrimination against gay/bisexual men, at least in provision
of health services    should be targeted
<P>
<U><B>IV.</B></U><B> <U>Policy Implications</U></B>
<P>
1. Implications of testing HIV positive in Burma
<P>
Little is known of SLORC's actual treatment of HIV infected persons.
 Confidentiality of results is extremely problematic in a dictatorship,
where clinical and laboratory staff may not be in positions to
protect patient rights from the government.  One foreign NGO worker
reported to SAIN that he was told the following at a public clinic
in Burma:
<P>
 
<P>
 All of our HIV results are confidential.  We keep them in a separate,
locked file to protect our patients.  But we do, of course, report
all HIV positives to the SLORC authorities. 
<P>
It is known that there is widespread fear of the SLORC and its
policies, real or imagined, toward infected persons, and that
this fear is a strong deterrent to voluntary testing in Burma.
 There have been difficult to substantiate allegations of treatment
of women returning from Thailand which include arrest, imprisonment,
and disappearances.  It is unclear whether HIV testing of subjects
in the national HIV surveillance is voluntary, and whether subjects
have the right to refuse testing without negative consequences.
 Pre and Post HIV test counseling procedures are also uncertain,
and follow up procedures for infected persons after testing are
not known.(21)  The data presented above on HIV testing of IVDUs,
for example, was collected by health officials, but no information
was provided on how the results were obtained, and of what happened
to the infected subjects, of whether coercion was used to obtain
results.  This is not merely a matter of good  medical practices
or of medical ethics, as SLORC law allows for 5 years of arrest
and detention without trial.   Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment
are common, and forced labor is widely used. 
<P>
2. Independence of Non-Governmental Organizations
<P>
Without a democratic system, and with government control of education,
the media, political parties, and much of the health care sector,
it is unclear how much autonomy for NGOs is tolerated by the SLORC.
 Certainly, criticism of the government and its policies is not
allowed.  Indigenous NGOs, like the Myanmar Red Cross Society,
are strongly influenced by the regime.  Foreign NGOs are, in general,
new to Burma, and it remains to be seen how much autonomy they
will be allowed.
<P>
At least one NGO with a mandate to assist with HIV prevention
activities spent more than 10 months in 1994-1995 waiting for
a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) before being able to initiate
their project.  The MOU was not signed, and the NGO pulled its
staff out of Burma.  At this writing negotiations are still ongoing.(This
organization asked not to be named as they are still hoping to
work in Burma.)
<P>
Another prominent NGO, the International Committee of the Red
Cross (ICRC), pulled out of Burma in mid 1995, citing refusal
of the SLORC to allow prison visits to political prisoners. 
<P>
3. Accountability of Donor Funds
<P>
SLORC is considered by virtually all observers to be pervasively
corrupt.  Donors monies, and donations of goods such as medical
supplies, may be diverted by the military, although these is little
documentation of this.  It is not known what percentage of aid
funds are pocketed, re-routed toward military uses, and what percentage
actually reaches the targets of donation.  This will remain a
an important issue in terms of monies and supplies donated for
the HIV/AIDS prevention and control effort.
<P>
4. Involvement of the SLORC in illegal narcotics 
<P>
There have allegations on the part of several international groups
and governments that the SLORC may either tacitly allow domestic
narcotics sales or that members of the government may be actively
involved in these activities.  Since these criminal activities
are key factors in the HIV explosion in Burma, the extant of SLORC's
involvement in these activates needs to be explored.
<P>
Conversations with health professionals point to 1988 as the year
heroin use became widespread among Burma's youth.  Before 1988
there had been scattered addicts, and traditional use of smoked
opium was common among some ethnic groups, but no Burmese interviewed
by SAIN could remember rampant and widespread use of heroin until
1988-1989.  The heroin epidemic coincides with the suppression
of the mass movement of 1988, when millions of Burma's people
rose up against years of military misrule and demanded democracy
in the non-violent uprising that swept Aung San Suu Kyi to national
prominence.  The rise in domestic heroin use in Burma closely
followed the junta's consolidation of power.  In 1995, their control
of the country is close to absolute.  They have remained in power
through a combination of brutal repression, attraction of foreign
investment capital, and high levels of military spending.  The
one sector of the economy they deny involvement in is the drug
business, though heroin is easily Burma's most lucrative cash
crop.  Is the military directly involved?  One student veteran
of the 1988 movement had this to say 
<P>
 &quot;If you put up a poster about democracy at Rangoon University
you get 15 years in jail, if you hold a meeting to discuss human
rights you get 15 years in jail, but you can sell heroin in the
college dormitory and nobody will bother you.&quot; 
<P>
While the ongoing military situation in the Shan States is often
cited as a cause of Burma's inability to control heroin production
and distribution, it should be remembered that ethnic groups which
have signed cease-fires, notably the Kachin Independence Organization
(KIO) have seen heroin use <I>increase</I> dramatically among
their young people since the cease-fires were signed.(Personal
Communication, All Burma Students Democratic Front.)  This, tragically,
has led to extraordinarily high rates of HIV infection in the
Kachin state.(See table 1.)  
<P>
5. Government policies that impede prevention efforts
<P>
A number of SLORCs official policies are clearly impediments to
HIV prevention efforts.  Examples include the ban on all reading
materials in prisons, the ban on condoms (now reversed), the lack
of participation on the part of the Burmese people in government
decisions, and the illegal status of syringes for personal use.
 Unofficial, or <I>de facto</I> policies may also play important
roles, and these are less known.  
<P>
<U><B>V.</B></U><B> <U>The Democratic Movement</U></B>
<P>
The democratically elected Government of Burma has been denied
its legitimate right to assume political leadership of the country,
a situation recognized by all parties in Burma, most governments
worldwide, and by the UN.  The junta now in power is an illegitimate
regime, and is widely feared, mistrusted, and resented by the
people of Burma.  Their political arm competed in the elections
of 1990, giving the people of Burma their first opportunity since
the coup of 1962 to voice their opinion about further military
rule; the party got less than 3% of the popular vote.  The election
was one by the National League for Democracy (NLD) led by Nobel
Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi.  
<P>
While the junta has been eager to attract foreign investment,
and to gain international legitimacy, the results have been mixed.
 Since 1990, there has been an ongoing campaign by the military
to crush the democratic forces.  Elected leaders have been jailed,
killed in exile, forced to chain prison labor gangs, harassed
and silenced.(18)  The NLD has survived, and Aung San Suu Kyi
continues to lead her people in a non-violent movement for the
restoration of democracy.  Investment by foreign companies has
undoubtedly helped to keep the junta solvent and in power.  International
Aid, and foreign NGO involvement, may have similar effects.  It
is for this reason that SAIN takes the position that any group
interested in HIV/AIDS programs in Burma do so with the support
of the NLD.  Bypassing the elected government of Burma can serve
to legitimize the regime, prolong the suffering of the people
of the country, and, in the long term, increase the HIV/AIDS burden
of the country.
<P>
Furthermore, because the SLORC is so widely feared and mistrusted,
agencies working through the SLORC are unlikely to be trusted
or respected by a majority of the people of Burma.  While it could
be argued that pragmatism demands cooperation with the junta,
it is also true that they have been poor collaborators to the
present, and have been unwilling to allow free and open access
to information, to hospitals, prisons, drug treatment centers,
and HIV/AIDS data.  NGOs deciding to &quot;bite the bullet&quot;
and work with SLORC have been frustrated and hampered in their
efforts, and in two cases cited above, have pulled their staffs
out of the country.
<P>
The NLD is currently in the process of establishing Health and
Public Welfare mechanisms to address issues of importance to the
people of Burma.  It remains to be seen how much freedom they
will be allowed by the junta to pursue these initiatives.  These
initiatives deserve the support and collaboration of the International
Community and of potential donor agencies.  Working through, or
at a minimum consulting with, the elected leaders of Burma should
be a priority of any organization seeking to address the HIV/AIDS
issue, and any other support or investment initiative in Burma.
   
<P>
<U><B>VI</B></U><B> <U>Policy Options</U></B>
<P>
Despite the fact that the HIV epidemic is a clear public health
emergency, implementing an effective HIV/AIDS control program,
and providing care for people with HIV infection, will be greatly
complicated by the political and social realities of  Burma under
the SLORC regime.  While international cooperative input will
certainly be necessary to contain the crisis, questions and concerns
about collaboration with the SLORC regime must be raised, researched,
and addressed. 
<P>
It is now well accepted in public health circles that the Burmese
HIV epidemic is one of the world's fastest growing.  It is also
well known that the resources and political will which would be
necessary to combat this explosive epidemic are limited.  The
political and economic isolation of the country is perhaps the
key factor which has limited resources.  Another has been the
resistance of the SLORC to collaborate with international organizations
and with indigenous NGOs. A third, and controversial limitation,
has been the role of the Burmese opposition and their international
supporters, who have been seen as limiting any international aid
to Burma in their attempts to further isolate the SLORC.  
<P>
There is an emerging consensus that further restrictions on donor
support to the SLORC for AIDS control will only punish the people
of Burma, and further the spread of HIV/AIDS.  While donor agencies
and NGOs may not be eager to work with a regime which has perpetrated
ongoing and well documented human rights abuses on a national
scale, the situation is seen as a public health emergency.  One
position recently put forward at the Third International Conference
on HIV/AIDS in the Asia Pacific Region, has been to &quot;de-politicize
AIDS.&quot;  In effect, to say that HIV control should be above,
or outside, political considerations.  How realistic is this as
a strategy to combat HIV in Burma?  Should all parties, the opposition
and ethnic nationalities included, join hands in an effort to
control what is already a national tragedy?
<P>
The clear and obvious first answer is yes.  But the current situation
in Burma is, unfortunately, considerably more complex.  There
are a number of important reasons why the HIV epidemic is <I>inherently
political</I>, and why it may be naive and counterproductive to
imagine that a &quot;de-politicization&quot; of the Burmese epidemic
is likely or even possible.
<P>
The following are proposed policy options developed by SAIN. 
There are clearly many others that should be discussed:
<P>
1. The full participation of the elected leadership, including
Aung San Suu Kyi and her party, in the national HIV/AIDS control
programme, and in any international collaborations.  
<P>
2. The full participation of the indigenous leaders of the ethnic
nationalities in HIV control programs in their regions.
<P>
3. A commitment on the part of the donors and on the part of the
SLORC to an open accounting of the use of funds and resources.
 Such an accounting could be made to a neutral international body,
and would include clauses for the cessation of aid if resources
were not reaching the target populations.
<P>
4. An agreement by all parties involved in HIV prevention, care,
and research, to fully abide by the Geneva accords on the rights
of research subjects.  Again, such agreements would include mechanisms
of observation, and mandatory of cessation of funds if rights
violations were identified.
<P>
5. The participation of people with AIDS, and of people from groups
at risk (sex workers, addicts, and others) in the design and implementation
of HIV programs.  These would include assurances of their protection,
and again, cessation of such projects if the rights of community
members were violated.  
<P>
<B>VII. <U>Conclusions</U></B>
<P>
The people of Burma have endured a long repressive period of military
government.  This has resulted in the impoverishment of what had
been a country of promising resources and wealth, in international
isolation, and chronic ethnic conflict and strife, and in the
frustration the intellectual and social life of a highly cultured
and literate people.  In 1990 the Burmese people voted for democracy,
only to have their aspirations, once again, postponed by the military.
 The introduction of the HIV virus into this resource and information
poor country has led to a new, and pervasive threat to the people
of Burma; an HIV/AIDS situation that is out of control, has spread
throughout the country, and is poised to devastate the development
potential of the country for years to come.
<P>
It may be possible to slow, and even contain, the epidemic of
HIV/AIDS in Burma, and it is the responsibility of those who care
for Burma to attempt this.  To implement programs without accepting
the political reality of Burma, however, is both bad public health
practice and bad scientific ethics.  AIDS cannot be de-politicized
in a totalitarian regime, but the impact of the regime on the
epidemic may be lessened by enlightened public health policy.
 
<P>
Perhaps the position of Archbishop Desmond Tutu during the Apartheid
struggle best illustrates where AIDS researchers and organizations
eager to help the Burmese people find themselves.  Tutu opposed
the immunization programs UNICEF wanted to mount in the old South
Africa.  UNICEF's position was that &quot;children are above politics.&quot;
 Tutu's was that the Apartheid system, not lack of vaccines, was
at the root of the disproportionate mortality among black children.
 Since UNICEF's involvement would give legitimacy to the Apartheid
government's claims to be &quot;helping&quot; blacks, it had to
be resisted.  The tragedy of Burma may be that without a political
solution to the countries' current crisis, HIV will be impossible
to control.  Unless the generals step aside soon, Burma will be
devastated by AIDS.
<P>
We must conclude, based on the evidence presented here, that control
of the HIV epidemic, as with so many other critical issues facing
Burma, will not be achieved until a real and lasting political
resolution, acceptable to all parties, is achieved.

demonstrated track record of providing an efficient and secure mechanism
for project development, implementation, and evaluation. Participants in
the Internet Outreach Program can contribute or discount resources

Internet Program or donate resources to the Open Society Fund for use in

been successfully providing Internet connectivity in Central and Eastern 
Europe and the former Soviet Union through its <a

since 1994. Working through the Soros <a href="/found.html">network of 
foundations</a> in those regions, the Regional Internet Program funds pilot 
projects which provide Internet access, training and support to libraries, 
schools, medical institutions, NGOs, independent media, and others.  The

located throughout Russia. This program is funded by OSI and the State
Committee on Higher Education of the Russian Federation with a five-year
commitment of $130 million for equipment, connectivity, and programs.  The
Internet Outreach Program, a joint program of the Open Society Institute
and Open Society Fund, offers a unique opportunity for those interested in
providing similar support. Participants also have the opportunity to

<b><i>The Internet is a milestone for  civilization...</i></b>
<p>
Many corporations and individuals associated with the Internet share a 
vision of the Internet's importance to the world. The chairman of the 
Open Society Institute, George Soros, believes that the Internet is 
as important a milestone in civilization as the Gutenberg press was 
in the 15th century a time when only a small elite were taught to 
read and write. Development of the printing press changed this and 
brought the power of the written word to more and more people. 
Today, where it is available, the Internet is empowering mass 
audiences in a similar way with a new method of communicating and 
disseminating information. But in regions with limited 
telecommunications infrastructure, the benefits of the Internet are 
unavailable. Concerted efforts by public and private entities to 
boost connectivity will help to create a critical mass of Internet 
self-sufficiency for future development in these areas.

RANGOON, Jan 9 (Reuter) - A Buddhist relic which escaped  
damage during a December 25 bombing that killed five people and 
wounded 17 was moved to Mandalay on Thursday, four days later 
than originally scheduled. <p>
  A source in Burma's Ministry of Religious Affairs said on  
Thursday the Sacred Tooth Relic, believed to be a tooth of the 
Lord Buddha, was flown to Burma's second city of Mandalay on 
Thursday morning. <p>
  The relic is on loan from China for 90 days and was  
originally due to be moved to Mandalay last Sunday. But that 
plan was changed after the bomb attack in the Kaba Aye Maha 
Pasana Cave where the relci was housed in Rangoon, the Religious 
Affairs source said. <p>
  Before the change in plans, the relic was to have been sent  
by road to Mandalay, with one-night stopovers in each of six 
towns. After four weeks, a similar trip was to be made with 
stops in six different cities.<p> 
  Thousands of pilgrims were paying homage at the cave on the  
outskirts of Rangoon on Christmas Day when two bombs went off. 
  Burma's military government blamed exiled students and the  
rebel Karen National Union ethnic group for the bombings. Both 
groups denied involvement.

  PRAGUE, Czech Republic (Reuter) - Burmese democracy leader  
Aung San Suu Kyi Friday received an honorary doctorate in 
absentia from Prague's Charles University in a show of Czech 
solidarity with Burma's democrats. <p>
  The Nobel laureate's husband, British professor Michael  
Aris, accepted the honor for Suu Kyi who has been largely 
confined to her house and told by military rulers that if she 
left Burma she would not be permitted to return. 
<p>
  The six-centuries-old Czech university awarded the Doctor of  
Law degree on the 20th anniversary of Prague's Charter 77 human 
rights declaration, for Suu Kyi's ``active participation in the 
fight for democracy, freedom and human rights.'' 
<p>
  In a speech read by Aris, Suu Kyi said that the fight of her  
National League for Democracy (NLD) was ``a struggle that knows 
little respite.'' 
  She said that Prague's 1989 bloodless ``gentle revolution''  
over communism, which was in large part inspired by the Charter, 
formed a special bond with Burma's democracy campaigners and 
``provided hope and practical lessons.'' 
  ``An idea whose time has come cannot be crushed,'' she said.  
  Suu Kyi's NLD won a landslide victory in a 1990 election,  
but has never taken power because the military government 
rejected the results of the poll. <p>
  In December, troops and riot police used water cannons and  
batons to force thousands of student demonstrators off the 
streets in the biggest anti-government demonstrations seen since 
national protests in 1988.

prostitutes and five pimps in downtown Rangoon in November and 
December in a crackdown on prostitution, official media reported 
on Wednesday. <p>
  ``Acting on information that pimps and prostitutes were  
active in the vicinity of Theingyi Market and on either side of 
Shwedagon Pagoda Road, where there are many night clubs and 
restaurants, police...have seized them,'' state-run newspapers 
reported. 
  They said action had been taken against those arrested, but  
did not give details. <p>
  Prostitution has been on the rise in some of Burma's major  
cities, where the world's oldest profession used to be virtually 
non-existent. 
  The rise in prostitution is often attributed to the hotel  
and tourism business, which has been growing steadily since the 
military government opened up the economy in 1988. 
  Some of the women involved in prostitution in downtown  
Rangoon recently told Reuters they were forced into it because 
of the high cost of living and scarcity of good-paying jobs.

  RANGOON, Jan 8 (Reuter) - Saw Oo Ray, a former elected  
representative of Burma's National League for Democracy (NLD) 
party, has been sentenced to 10 years in prison, official media 
said on Wednesday. <p>
  Saw Oo Ray, who was forced last year to resign as member of  
parliament (MP) for the NLD headed by democracy leader Aung San 
Suu Kyi, was found guilty of providing money to the Karenni 
insurgent group in 1992 and of illegally writing a book 
``encouraging insurgency and narrow-minded racism'' in 1993, the 
state-run Mirror Daily said. <p>
  An ethnic Karenni from Kayah state, Saw Oo Ray was sentenced  
to three years in jail under the Unlawful Associations Act and 
seven years under an amendment to the Printers and Publishers' 
Registration Act. <p>
  It did not give further details.  <p>
  Suu Kyi mentioned Saw Oo Ray in a news conference on  
Saturday as being one of the party members arrested by the 
military government despite giving in to pressure to resign 
their parliament positions. 
  ``I would like you to publicise the fact that the  
authorities are forcing our members of parliament to resign from 
their positions,'' she said. 
  ``And even after their resignations they are still given  
very very heavy prison sentences,'' she said. ``Giving into 
these unjust demands does not do us any good. It does not give 
us any lighter sentences.'' <p>
  The NLD won a landslide victory in a 1990 election, but was  
not allowed to take office because the ruling State Law and 
Order Restoration Council (SLORC) never recognised the results 
of the poll. 
  After the election, the SLORC began to pressure the elected  
MPs, forcing many to flee the country or eventually resign from 
politics.

BANGKOK,
Thailand will protest to Burma about the attack early Friday on two 
     camps in
     Thai territory housing Karenni refugees, the army commander-in-chief 
     General
     Chetta Thanajaro told reporters.
     
        "As a matter of principle we have to protest to the Burmese 
     government when
     our border is infringed by troops from Burma or any other country," he 
     said,
     adding that Burma should prevent soldiers and guerrillas crossing the 
     border.  
     <p>
        Thai border police said two people were killed and five were 
     wounded in the
     attack, 40 kilometres (24 miles) from the northern Thai border town of 
     Mae Hong
     Son.
     <p>
        Police said the refugees told them 30 armed men dressed in the 
     uniforms of a
     breakaway Karenni rebel group staged the attack.
<p>     
        Foreign ministry spokesman Surapong Jayanama said Thailand would 
     direct a
     complaint about the incident towards the Burmese government, if it was 
     clear
     that the assailants had originated from Burmese territory.
     
        If it was proved the attack involved Burmese government troops then 
     Burmese
     diplomats in Thailand would be called in for talks with the Thai 
     government, he
     said.

        He noted that border issues were usually dealt with by a Thai-Burma 
     border
     committee.

     TAK - Two Karenni refugees were killed and 10 others injured when 
     Burmese soldiers fired mortar shells and automatic weapons into 
     adjoining refugee camps in northern Mae Hong Son province early 
     yesterday morning.
     <p>
     The dead were identified as a 23-year old woman, Ai Phyin, and Aik 
     Phone, a 35-year-old man. Three of the wounded were seriously injured.
     
     Pol Lt Col Decha Khamgerd, commander of Border Patrol Police unit 336, 
     led his men to the site and later took the wounded to a local 
     hospital.
     <p>
     The violent assault, by an estimated 25 Burmese soldiers, occurred 
     about 2.30 am on camps 1 and 2 - known as Baan Pang Kwai and Baan Pang 
     Tracter - in Pang Moo sub-district, about four kilometres inside 
     Thailand. It lasted 15 minutes.
     <p>
     About 6,000 Karenni refugees immediately fled deeper into Thailand.
     
     Some refugees took temporary shelter at Baan Nai Soi, about five 
     kilometres from the two camps, and others at camp 3. But many were 
     still hiding in the jungle yesterday, fearing a renewed attack.
     <p>
     Neither government officials, relief workers, Karenni guerrillas nor 
     Burmese student dissidents could explain the motive for the attack.
     
     Foreign Ministry spokesman Surapong Jayanama said yesterday he had not 
     received a full account of the incident.
     
     However, he added that if the incursion and violence actually occurred 
     then the government would have to take appropriate steps, but such 
     steps would depend on the gravity of the situation.
     <p>
     He said that Burmese army violations of Thai territory and military 
     operations against armed ethnic insurgents have been going on for 
     three decades.
     
     If the latest violation is not considered severe, then the matter 
     could be raised through the Thai-Burmese General Border Committee.
     
     If the matter is considered grave, then the Foreign Ministry might 
     call in the Burmese ambassador in Bangkok to present a protest note.
     <p>
     Thailand has made a diplomatic protest every time there has been a 
     Burmese violation of Thai sovereignty, but the Burmese government has 
     never paid any compensation for damage caused.
     
     Yesterday's intrusion prompted security forces to prepare for 
     retaliation in the event of a repeat incident.
     
     Burma's ethnic Karenni guerrillas, which are active in the area across 
     from Thailand, immediately issued a statement calling for relief for 
     the fugitives.
     
     The statement from the Karenni Karenni National Progressive Party 
     (KNPP),  whose ceasefire with the Burmese junta in 1995 lasted only a 
     short time because of a renewed Burmese military offensive against 
     them, said that many refugees are still missing.
     <p>
     A member of the local security force said he was awakened by the sound 
     of mortar shells exploding and the rattle of M-16 and AK-47 assault 
     rifles. He estimated at least 100 shots were fired.
     
     A statement from an exiled student group, the All Burma Students' 
     Democratic Front (ABSDF), said that a commando unit from the 302nd 
     Light Infantry Battalion of the Burmese army carried out the attack.
     <p>
     The statement said that the assailants deliberately left uniforms and 
     literature published by the Karenni National Democratic Party, a 
     breakaway group from the KNPP, at the site in an attempt to pass the 
     blame onto the faction.
     
     A Thai official said that the attack could have been prompted by the 
     presence of about 300 ABSDF students in the camps. The students fled 
     into Thailand last year after the Burmese army captured KNPP and 
     student strongholds during a heavy military offensive.
     <p>
     The Burmese junta has blamed the ABSDF and another ethnic Karen group 
     for the Christmas bombing of a Buddhist religious complex near Rangoon 
     thatkilled five people and wounded 17.

YANGON, Jan. 4 (Kyodo) -- Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi called for a 
broad-based movement to bring about democracy in Myanmar during a ceremony 
she held in her compound Saturday to celebrate the 49th anniversary of the 
country's independence.
     <p>
Democracy cannot be achieved by her National League for Democracy (NLD) 
alone, said Suu Kyi, daughter of Gen. Aung Sang, who was assassinated along 
with other pro-independence fighters just months before Myanmar, then called 
Burma, regained independence from Britain in 1948.
     <p>
Addressing more than 500 people, including foreign diplomats, Suu Kyi said 
the opinions of people from all walks of life must be taken into account in 
the struggle for democracy.
    <p> 
Political analysts said the remarks are an apparent appeal to students who 
had demonstrated against the nonelected military government, the State Law
and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), last month to join forces with the NLD.
     <p>
The NLD won a landslide victory in 1990 general elections, but the military 
refused to recognize the results and cede power.
     <p>
The SLORC allowed people showing invitation cards from the NLD to proceed to 
Suu Kyi's house for the ceremony, although the roads leading to her house 
are still cordoned off.
     <p>
Since the student demonstrations and a bombing in Yangon last month that 
left five people dead, the military junta has virtually forced Suu Kyi to 
stay at home and prevented visitors from seeing the NLD leader.
     <p>
Saturday's celebration was her first public address to supporters since a 
rally called by NLD deputy leader Tin Oo on Dec. 5.
     <p>
Speaking to reporters after her speech, Suu Kyi countered the junta's 
allegations that the NLD had fanned the student unrest to destabilize the 
country.
     <p>
''The government's criticism that the NLD instigated the students is 
completely contrary to the truth,'' she said in what was her first news 
conference at her compound in two months.
     <p>
Meanwhile, SLORC chairman Gen. Than Shwe called on the people to defend 
national sovereignty against ''attempts to disintegrate the country by
internal traitors and external elements,'' but did not directly attack the NLD.
     <p>
''It is the national duty of all people in the country to try to consolidate 
and perpetuate the national sovereignty and to oppose instigations and 
attempts by destructionists both from inside and outside the country,'' the 
general said in a message published in government newspapers to mark the 
Independence Day.
     <p>
The junta held a simple flag-hoisting ceremony and a military parade in the 
capital.

                     RANGOON, Burma (Reuter) -- A top
                     Burmese official said Thursday that the 
                     government would retain restrictions on 
                     democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and
                     that some universities would remain closed 
                     following student unrest last month.
     <p>
                     Senior intelligence official Colonel Thein
                     Swe told Reuters the requirements that Suu Kyi to
                     inform the government of her movements and report visitors 
                     to her home aimed to protect, not inconvenience, her.
            <p>         
                     "We are concerned for her. We are responsible for her
                     safety," Thein Swe said after the monthly news briefing of 
                     the ruling State
                     Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC).
                  <p>   
                     He told the news conference he did not know when the
                     restrictions
                     might be lifted, saying only it would be when the situation 
                     normalized.
                     <p>
                     But Suu Kyi, who was released from six years' house
                     arrest in July 1995, told Reuters in a telephone interview 
                     on Thursday it was "very silly" to presume the restrictions 
                     were imposed for her benefit.
     <p>
                         "That's a very silly thing to say. I
                         don't take
                         them seriously and hope you don't
                         either,"
                         she said. "I don't think they are
                         helping me
                         in any way."
            <p>             
                         Suu Kyi must advise officials of her
                         social
                         plans. The SLORC also make
                         arrangements for her to travel to places within Rangoon 
                         or allow visitors past the blockades blocking traffic 
                         from her
                         street.
                  <p>       
                         Deputy Education Minister Than Nyunt
                         said some of the universities that were shut in early
                         December,
                         several weeks before regular December holidays, would
                         reopen
                         on January 6.
                         <p>
                         But the schools at the center of the recent unrest
                         would remain
                         closed for the time being, he said.
                         <p>
                         About 50,000 students across the country would be
                         affected by
                         the closures. He said he did not know if they would be
                         opened in
                         time for exams scheduled for next month.
                         <p>
                         SLORC officials in early December placed restrictions
                         on Suu Kyi
                         following a wave a protests, when several thousand
                         students took
                         to the street in rare demonstrations against the
                         military authorities.
                         <p>
                         Government blames Suu Kyi's party for unrest
                         <p>
                         The government has accused Suu Kyi's National League 
                         for Democracy (NLD) party of politicizing the student
                         protests. NLD
                         officials and the students have denied any
                         collaboration between
                         the groups.
                         <p>
                         Another senior intelligence official, Colonel Kyaw
                         Thein, told
                         reporters there could be some links between the student
                         unrest and
                         the December 25 incident when two time bombs exploded 
                         at a Buddhist site in a Rangoon suburb, killing five 
                         people and wounding 17.
                         <p>
                         He said he could not rule out the possibility the NLD
                         could be
                         involved to some extent in the bombing.
                         <p>
                         "I don't deny (the possibility). There are a lot of
                         possibilities," he
                         said after the briefing. "I don't know exactly who are 
                         the responsible persons who placed the bomb and who
                         directed them.
                         We don't have the evidence yet."
                         <p>
                         The government has blamed an ethnic guerrilla
                         organization -- the
                         Karen National Union (KNU) -- and exiled dissidents for 
                         the bombings. The KNU and the Thai-based dissident 
                         students
                         group
                         have denied involvement.
                         <p>
                         Separately, Suu Kyi told Reuters the NLD planned to
                         continue its
                         efforts to bring democracy to Burma in the coming year.
                         <p>
                         "In one word, what I want for this year is democracy,"
                         she said,
                         repeating a request for increased pressure by the
                         international
                         community to help reach the goal.
                         <p>
                         "I think the international community should do
                         everything it can to
                         help in the fight for democracy," she said.<p>

Five Killed by Bomb Blasts at Burma Temple</h1></td>

     December 27, 1996<p>
     
     RANGOON - Two bombs exploded at a Burmese Buddhist shrine 
     frequented by leaders of Burma's military r me on Christmas 
     night, the second killing five people and wounding 17, a 
     government spokesman said yesterday.
     <p>
     The blasts occurred on Wednesday at the KabaAye Pagoda and 
     man-made Maha Pasana Cave about 12 kilometres north of downtown 
     Rangoon as hordes of pilgrims were paying homage to the Sacred 
     Tooth Relic, which is on loan from China.
     <p>
     The government later  said a timebomb was responsible for the 
     deaths and accused student exes and Karen ethnic insurgents of 
     planting it.
     <p>
     State-run Radio Rangoon said that " time bombs had exploded at 
     the  Kaba Aye  pagoda complex, while a Burmese government 
     information sheet received in Bangkok spoke of a two-inch-square 
     timed mine."
     <p>
     The information sheet quoted intelligence reports as saying that 
     the All Burma Student Democratic Front and the Karen National 
     Union have concocted a plan to destabilise the peaceful situation 
     prevailing in the country by terrorist activities."        
     <p>
     Official media earlier said the bombs were planted by  "a group 
     of dastardly destructive elements" aimed at harming Sino-Burmese 
     ties, and  caused " terror and anxiety among the people".
     <p>
     The first, which exploded near the eastern gate of the cave at about 
     8.20 pm and injured  no one, came just three hours after a visit by 
     Lt Gen Tin Oo, third in command of the ruling State Law and Order 
     Restoration Council (Slorc). Security officials were checking the 
     pagoda and grounds when the second bomb went off in=20 the Maha 
     Pasana Cave shrine at 10.35 pm, killing one security official, one 
     Red Cross worker and two members of the government-sponsored Union 
     Solidarity Development Association,
     the official newspaper  New Light of Myanamr reported. A fifth 
     person, a sub-inspector of the police special branch later 
     succumbed to his injuries.
     <p>
     The fatal bomb had been planted inside a  flower container where 
     pilgrims  place d offerings as they filed past the  relic to pay 
     their respects.
     <p>
     A monk and five pilgrims were among those injured and all the 
     victims were believed to be Burmese . No claim of responsibility 
     was mentioned. A doctor treating the injured said most were 
     struck by shrapnel, noting that more might have been hurt if the 
     first explosion had not scared many people from the area.
     <p>
     Lt Gen Khin Nyunt, the fourth highest- ranking government member, 
     visited the injured in hospital yesterday.
     <p>
     The Sacred Tooth Relic, believed to be a tooth of the Lord 
     Buddha, was brought to Burma on Dec 6 on loan for 90 days and was 
     taken to the Pagoda in a chariot drawn by an elephant replete
     with regalia in the style of replete with  regalia in the style of 
     Burma's
     ancient kingdom. The relic was not damaged, the media reported.
     <p>
     Thousands of people have visited the pagoda daily, including top 
     leaders of the ruling junta. State newspapers carried front -page 
     pictures
     of the Slorc chairman Gen Than Shwe when he paid a visit.
     <p>
     Security was stepped up around the home of the Chinese ambassador 
     and other official Chinese offices yesterday and soldiers were 
     deployed to guard the temple compound.
     <p>
     The Chinese Embassy yesterday condemned what it called a "terrorist 
     action".
     <p>
     We are shocked at the bomb explosion in the Maha Pasana Cave on 
     December 25 and strongly condemn this terrorist action, " the embassy 
     said.
     <p>
     "The bomb attacks on the sacred shrine killing and injuring 
     innocent people blaspheme the Buddha and go against the will of 
     the people," the embassy statement said.<p>

European Commission scraps special trade benefits for Burma
</h1></td>

<p>
   
    BRUSSELS, Dec 18(Reuter) - The European Commission called on 
     Wednesday for special trade benefits for Burma to be scrapped 
     following an investigation into the use of forced labour by the 
     military regime in Rangoon.
<p>     
     The decision is a blow to Rangoon's pride, but will have little effect 
     on its wallet. Burmese industrial exports to European Union countries 
     totalled just $30 million in 1995, and special low tariffs saved it no 
     more than $365,000, the Commission estimates.
     <p>
     ``It is symbolic,'' said one Commission official. ``But the symbolism 
     is vitally important to SLORC.''
     <p>
     SLORC, the State Law and Order Restoration Council which governs 
     Burma, came under fire again earlier this week when the EU issued a 
     statement condeming police brutality while dispersing recent student 
     demonstrations in Rangoon.
     <p>
     The symbolism may be important in an international context, too, as 
     this was the first case to draw a direct link between trade and abuse 
     of basic workers' rights, an issue which greatly excercised a meeting 
     of world trade ministers last week.
     <p>
     Developing countries are concerned that linking the two issues will 
     open a back door for protectionists wanting to keep products made by 
     low-paid workers out of their home markets.
     <p>
     Under European law, however, trade benefits which are unilaterally 
     granted to developing countries to encourage economic growth can be 
     suspended if beneficiaries are shown to force people to work against 
     their will or without pay.
     <p>
     The Commission's recommendation will likely be approved by EU finance 
     ministers in January.
     
     ``Benefits will not be reinstated until SLORC can prove to us that 
     there
     is no more forced labour in Burma,'' said a Commission spokesman. 
     ``The onus is very much on them. And frankly for the paltry sums 
     involved, we don't expect them to be making the effort any time 
     soon.''
     <p>
     SLORC refused to allow Commission officials to visit Burma, saying 
     that there was nothing to investigate.
     
     So investigators instead spent a year poring through thousands of 
     pages of presonal accounts and hearing testimony from people who say 
     they have been made to work as virtual slaves, often on infrastructure 
     and hotel projects which SLORC hopes will bring in much-needed foreign 
     exchange.
     <p>
     According to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions 
     (ICFTU), which launched the complaint, 800,000 Burmese are forced to 
     work without pay or against their will, contributing around a tenth of 
     the country's economic output.
  <p>   
     The ICFTU has more bad news for Burma. The current rules apply only to 
     industrial production. But as of January 1, 1997, preferential tariffs 
     on agricultural imports can also be suspended if workers' rights are 
     abused, as long as an independent body lodges a complaint.
     
     ``We have a complaint ready to deliver to the Commission on January 
     2,'' said Janek Kuczkiewicz of the ICFTU. Wiping out special tariffs 
     on agricultural products would hit another $19 million worth of 
     important rural exports to the EU such as shrimps and rice.

<i>The Asian Age</i><br>

Bangkok, Dec.26: Burma's military authorities announced on 
Thursday that they were cancelling plans to run the seventh annual 
International Marathon on December 30. Sate-run radio Rangoon, 
monitored in Bangkok, gave no reason for the cancellation.  The 
announcement was made less than 24 hours after a double bomb blast 
at the Kaba Aye pagoda complex which killed five
people and injured 18. The marathon, initially planned for December 14, 
had been rescheduled to December 30 after hundreds of students took to the 
streets of Rangoon to demand the right to form the union and the release 
of detained students.  The newspapers in Burma said the blasts were 
intended to "cause terror and anxiety among the people," the paper said. 
The newly-built pagoda is on the northern edge of Rangoon, between Inya 
Lake and the airport. (AFP)

CHILDREN SACRIFICED TO WAR: BURMA;

        The Guardian
     <br>
                                    November 11, 1996<br>

Nick Cumming Bruce, Bangkok<br>
     
 <p>
 Take Burma's Child Law at face value and the ruling military State 
     Law and
     Order Restoration Council (Slorc) appears keen to promote child 
     welfare and
     development. It gives children the right to participate in social and 
     religious
     organisations, and freedom of speech.
     
         Take instead the experience of Naw Sah Mu, an ethnic Karen girl 
     aged 15, who
     was taken by the military to work as a porter.  She has had a leg 
     blown off by a
     land mine and seen a friend blinded by shrapnel.  
     
         Now the harsher reality of Slorc rule starts to emerge.
     <p>
         The number of minorities fleeing to camps along the border with 
     Thailand is
     rising inexorably. The refugees tell of military brutality against 
     every section
     of the population, including children.
     
         More than 101,000 people from three minorities - Karen, Karenni 
     and Mon -
     crowd into 26 border camps; half of them are aged under 19. They 
     survive on a
     meagre subsistence. The children in particular suffer from malaria, 
     diarrhoea
     and respiratory problems, but at least they are safe.
     <p>
         After decades of conflict with minorities seeking autonomy, Slorc 
     forces are
     relentlessly taking control of their states.  However, the end of 
     fighting has
     not brought with it peace.
     
         Young children are forced to work as porters, carrying heavy loads 
     of
     ammunition and food - the loads increasing as they get older - or 
     sweep roads
     for mines.
     
         Those who escape say beatings are common; those falling sick are 
     left to
     die.  At night, women of all ages routinely face multiple rape by 
     soldiers.
     
         Conditions are worst in areas of fighting: troops systematically 
     burn
     villages and crops to force out their populations. Many are driven 
     into labour
     camps or reduced to begging, others escape into the hills, running a 
     gauntlet of
     hunger and disease which is said to kill up to half of those aged 
     under five.
     <p>
         Even in areas away from fighting, Slorc compels families to send 
     their
     children, some as young as eight, to build roads and railways.

<p>
         * Glenys Kinnock will present a videotape to MEPs in Strasbourg 
     today in
     which Burma's leading democracy activist, Aung San Suu Kyi, accuses 
     Rangoon of
     using children, prisoners and civilians for forced labour.
     
         Mrs Kinnock, Labour's MEP for South Wales East, flew to Burma at 
     the weekend
     to muster support for an investigation by the European Union into 
     labour
     conditions in Burma and an end to its preferential trade tariffs.
     <p>
         On Saturday, a government mob attacked cars carrying Ms Suu Kyi 
     and two
     other leading activists.

Burmese Prostitutes Trapped in a Dark Underworld

The BurmaNet News: January 21, 1996<br>
Issue #327<br>
[This article has been excerpted.]

<p>
Selective enforcement of immigration and prostitution laws 

is shoring up the trade in women from Burma and adding to 

the risk of HIV infection, Pan Simmons writes.

     

In 1994, the authors of a report from Asia Watch, an 

international human rights organisation, claimed...in 

Thailand, the rate of HIV infection among prostitutes from 

Burma was about three times higher than that among Thai 

prostitutes.

     

Part of the reason for the higher rate of infection lies in 

customers' refusal to use condoms and the powerlessness of 

the women to insist on their use. This report was the first 

public alert to the flourishing trade in young Burmese women 

and its attendant bonded labour, arbitrary detention, 

physical abuse and complicity of government officials.

     
<p>
The trafficking of Burmese women to Thailand for sex work 

was...recently brought to people's attention at a seminar 

late last year, organised by the Foundation for Women (FFW), 

a Bangkok-based women's organisation.

     

Siriporn Skrobanek, secretary general of FFW, explained in 

her opening address:  "Thailand bears some considerable 

responsibility for the fate of Burmese sex workers because 

it is both a destination and departure point for women 

transported and traded for prostitution."

     
<p>
On the basis of 21 interviews with Burmese women and other 

interviews with governmental and non-governmental agencies, 

FFW's researchers, Praphakorn Wongratanawin and Ratchawan 

Singhanet found that the effectiveness of HIV/Aids education 

and assistance programmes was severely limited by language 

barriers and difficulties in reaching the women directly.

     

The researchers also found that the women's knowledge about 

protecting themselves against HIV infection was minimal. 

These findings are hardly surprising, given the illicit 

nature of the sex industry in Thailand, the illegal status 

of most Burmese migrants and the tense political situation 

in Burma.

     
<p>
Getting information about Aids to Burmese women on either 

side of the border is a challenge to the most inventive 

campaigner. The researchers pointed to the lack of suitable 

educational material for use among particular groups, such 

as the Shan and Mon ethnic groups and the overly detailed 

and sometimes gruesome portrayal of symptoms which 

serve...to frighten people than inform them.

     
<p>
Printed text is not much use to people who cannot read. 

Most of the women interviewed had had little formal 

education. The researchers tested a range of printed 

material during the  interviews and only three of the 21 

women could read and understand the material.

     

Knowledge about Aids has little benefit if the woman has no


chance to negotiate working conditions such as the number of 

clients and safe sex practices. Most prostitutes in Thailand 

operate relatively independently and have considerable 

control over their working conditions. For others...control 

is firmly in the hands of the brothel owners.

     
<p>
Running a brothel is illegal in Thailand, as is 

prostitution. But apart from few highly publicised raids, 

brothel owners are mostly left to their business. The 

fact that their activity falls outside of the law seems more to 

cultivate corruption among public authorities and intensify 

control over the women employed than discourage the growth 

of the industry.

     
<p>
Researcher Praphakorn summed up the push and pull to migrate 

as the deteriorating economic and political situation in


Burma, particularly  in rural areas, coupled with the higher 

wages and demand for labour in Thailand.

     

This is a familiar pattern world-wide in the history of 

labour migration. In this case, Burmese women are being 

pressed into sexual service to meet the demand from both 

Burmese labourers and Thai and foreign businessmen and 

tourists.

     
<p>
The growth in the sex industry in provinces bordering Burma 

is accompanying the rise in cross-border trade in goods and 

labour. The economic boom in Thailand and the robust tourist 

industry, shadowed by the threat of Aids resulted in 

greater demand for women from remote areas and younger women 

are prime targets for recruiters.

     
<p>
The women interviewed in Ranong province were mostly ethnic 

Burmans from lowland Burma or Mon women from southern border 

states. They crossed the river border by boat or, in the dry 

season, by foot.

     

In the northern province of Thailand, they were mostly Shan 

women. Burma's Shan state lies across the border fro Chiang 

Rai. They had travelled to Thailand by motorcycle or in a 

songthaew (pick up taxi). This route is policed well by 

Burmese soldiers of the ruling State Law and Order 

Restoration Council (Slorc).

     
<p>
The soldiers are instructed to turn back young and unmarried 

women. In effect, this instruction is only used to solicit

bribes from the women. Bribing takes place on both sides of 

the border with some public tour bus drivers demanding 

payments of Bt3,500 to transport the women to other 

provinces.

     

As illegal immigrants they have little choice but to pay. 

The threat of arrest and deportation hangs over them all the 

way. As the authors of the Asia Watch reported:  "The 

Immigration Act is often  used not to keep Burmese from 

entering Thailand, but to ensure compliance and obedience 

once they are there."

     
<p>
In 1992, when the Asia Watch investigation began, rights to 

privacy and confidentiality in HIV testing were routinely 

ignored. Immigration officials and brothel owners were more 

likely to be informed of a woman's HIV status than the woman 

herself.

     

Mandatory testing was common-place, particularly following 

arrest by Thai authorities. The Thai National Aids 

Prevention and Control Plan (1992-1996) has injunctions 

against revealing HIV status without the full and explicit 

consent of the infected person.

     
<p>
The 1995 FFW's investigation showed little improvement in 

protection of such rights. Testing, physical examinations 

and counselling services at public hospitals were available 

to Burmese sex workers, but without the aid of translators 

many women did not understand what the examination was for 

nor the results of tests.

     
<p>
In these circumstances, counselling was out of the question. 

The regularity of health checks was...often decided by the 

brothel owners. They required the women to carry healths 

cards which indicated the dates and results of checks. Not 

surprisingly, there was no such requirement of customers.

     
<p>
FFW's researchers heard reports of agency workers 

accompanying Burmese women to the hospital as translators 

but keeping the results of the tests to themselves. Some 

were too inexperienced to be of much assistance and others 

may have found the job of informing someone of their HIV 

status too trying.

     
<p>
In Thailand, prostitutes who test positive are supposed to 

be encouraged to leave sex work. But the government offers 

little by way of guaranteed health care or alternative 

employment. This is especially so for women repatriated to 

Burma.

     

The troublesome question of how to disseminate information 

remains. As Prachakorn Wongratanaw pointed out in her 

summary:  "Information must get to women sex workers and to


women in the regions of Burma where sex workers are being 

drawn from."

     
<p>
With a government leery of non-governmental agencies and 

unwilling to do much themselves, as the Slorc is in Burma, 

it is hard for Aids campaigners to know where to start.

     

The researchers...floated the idea of forcing the owners of 

brothels to bear some of the costs of Aids patient care. 

This would be difficult to enforce while prostitution is 

still illegal.

     
<p>
Decriminalising prostitution is one of the broader issues 

brought to light by the research. The Burmese women 

are vulnerable to harassment and detention as illegal 

immigrants and engaged in illegal work.

     

It leaves them with minimal negotiating power with employers 

or customers, and hence more susceptible to HIV infection. 

The power of brothel owners is immense when it comes to 

bonded labour.

     
<p>
In many cases it extends to controlling access by health 

workers to sex workers. Health workers find themselves in 

the unenviable position of trading silence about 

imprisonment, deceit and physical abuse for the continued 

opportunity of general health education.

     

In the selective enforcement and manipulation of immigration 

and prostitution laws, the authorities are...shoring up the 

trade in women from Burma and adding to the risk of HIV 

infection.

UN Panel Rebukes Burma for Human Rights Abuses

<P>
      By Evelyn Leopold
<P>
    UNITED NATIONS, Dec 11 (Reuter) - A U.N. General Assembly
panel on Monday
<P>
deplored human rights abuses in Burma and called on the Rangoon
government to 

begin a proper political dialogue with Nobel Peace Prize winner
Aung San Suu 

Kyi.

     

    But the United States, represented by Ambassador Madeleine
Albright, said

Washington supported but did not sponsor the draft resolution
because the 

language was too weak on the military's human rights violations
and other 

provisions.

     
<P>
    The draft was adopted by consensus by the General Assembly's
social,

humanitarian and cultural committee without a vote. The committee's
decision, 

which includes all U.N. members, means the full assembly will
rubber-stamp 

the draft.

     

    The 20-point resolution ``deplores the continued violation
of human

rights'' in Burma, which calls itself Myanmar, and welcomes the
release of 

Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest.

     

    The resolution urged the government to enter at the earliest
possible

date into a dialogue with her and other political leaders in an
effort to 

restore democracy.

     
<P>
    Her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), won elections
in 1990

but the military stayed in power.

     

    The resolution said the government should stop ``torture,
abuse of women,

forced labour and forced relocations and to the enforced disappearances
and 

summary executions.''

     

    It was based on a report from a U.N. human rights rapporteur,
Yozo Yokata

of Japan, who said Burma may be using forced labour to spruce
up landmarks 

for foreign tourists in an effort to promote 1996 as ``Visit Myanmar
Year'' 

and pointed to summary executions, torture and rape by the army.

     
<P>
    The document also urged the government to release other prisoners,
to

restore fundamental freedoms of expression and assembly and to
end forced 

labour and to allow Red Cross officials access to the country's
jails and 

prisoners.

     
<P>
    Burma's representative, U Win Mra, said the draft did not
recognise the

country's positive developments and he rejected allegations of
human rights 

violations.

     

    ``It has never been the policy of the government to condone
the

violations of human rights,'' he said, adding that ``allegations
of forced 

labour have no basis of truth.''

     

    ``The true situation in Myanmar is not accurately conveyed
in the

international media,'' he said.

     
<P>
    In response, Albright said the resolution welcomes cease-fires
with

ethnic groups but failed to note that the Burmese army did not
always honour 

them.

     

    She also said the language on forced labour was not strong
enough and

that the resolution was not specific on the withdrawal and subsequent


expulsion from the National constitution convention of delegations
from the 

NLD.

     

    ``My government also wants to express its very great concern
about recent

statements from Rangoon that brand Aung San Suu Ky and her supporters
as 

'traitors' and speak of 'annihilating' those who criticise the
National 

Convention,'' Albright said.

<b>     A WONDERLAND OF BURMESE LEGENDS</b><br>
     Khin Myo Chit<br>
     Illustrated by Paw Oo Thet<br>
     1983. vii, 126 pp., 48 col. pl., 1 map ISBN 974-86220-6, $18<p>
     This richly illustrated book takes the reader on a journey 
     through the legendary and famous places of Burma, and relates 
     the legends associated with each place, legends which are in 
     the blood and soul of every Burmese - young or old. The author 
     takes us from Rangoon, Pegu and Prome to Sriksetra and up the 
     Irrawaddy to Mandalay and Sagaing, a journey accompanied by 
     the magic watercolours by the late Paw Oo Thet, Burma's best 
     loved contemporary artist. An indispensable companion and 
     guide to contemporary Burmese life and thought. 
     <p>
<b>     ILLUSIONS OF LIFE: BURMESE MARIONETTES </b><br>
     Ma Thanegi<br>
     1995,1996. viii, 108 pp., 101 colour plates, 17 b/w drawings. <br>
     ISBN 974-7315-75-9, hard $29, soft $23<p>
     In the 18th and 19th centuries, Burmese marionettes enjoyed a 
     rare and powerful privilege as speakers for both kings and 
     subjects. Never merely for entertainment, puppetry was a high 
     art held in much esteem. Marionettes were means of making 
     people aware of current events; a medium for educating the 
     masses in literature, history and religion; a display of 
     lifestyle and customs. These yoke-thei, 'small dolls', enjoyed 
     greater freedom of speech, dress and movement than live 
     performers. They therefore played a significant role in the 
     development of dance and dramatic arts.
     The author is a well known Burmese painter, and this lively 
     book is liberally spiced with information about Burma and 
     Burmese ways. It contains a systematic presentation of the
     Burmese marionette tradition, a tradition in the danger of extinction.

<b>     THE CAGED ONES</b><br>
     Ludu U Hla<br>
     Translated from Burmese by Sein Tu<br>
     Illustrated by U Wa Thone<br>
     First English edition 1986, 1997. viii, 144 pp., one col. pl., 
     16 b/w drawings. Crown 8vo.<br>
     ISBN 974-87368-6-5, $12 (remainders) <p>
     Imprisoned for political reasons in the 1950's (and later), 
     Ludu U Hla--perhaps Burma's most prolific modern author and 
     collector of Burmese folklore and cultural material--penned 
     these sensitive portraits of his teenage fellows-behind-bars. 
     His sympathetic probe of 'criminals' old and new, willing and 
     unwilling, 
     uncovers the social pressures and failings that turn the weak, the 
     young 
     and unfortunate against society, and harden them in a career of crime. 
     This book won a UNESCO prize in 1958.

     <b>ON THE ROAD TO MANDALAY</b> <br>
     Portraits of Ordinary People<br>
     Mya Than Tint<br>
     Translated by Ohnmar Khin and Sein Kyaw Hlaing <br>
     Illustrated by U Win Pe<br>
     1987-91, First English translation 1996. 284 pp., maps, ill. <br>
     ISBN 974-89271-9-9, $23<p>
     
     Inspired by Chicago journalist Stud Terkel's accounts of hopes 
     and dreams of ordinary Americans, Rangoon-based writer Mya 
     Than Tint introduces us to thirty-four of Burma's forty 
     million 'ordinary people', the a-nya-ta-ra. As he traveled 
     through Burma on literary lecture tours in the late 1980's, he 
     encountered porters, sailors, fortune-tellers, waitresses, 
     artists and petty criminals 'on the road to Mandalay'. This is
     Mya Than Tint's first major work to be translated into English.

<b>     LAND OF JADE</b><br>
     A Journey from India through Northern Burma to China <br>
     Second, updated edition <br>
     Bertil Lintner<br>

     1990,1996. 390 pp. 39 col.pl., 69 b/w pl., 7 maps. Index. Sm.

     In August 1985, "Mr de Souza from Goa", his considerable body 
     wrapped in a blanket, his jet black hair flowing gently in the 
     breeze, and his eyes hidden by huge, dark, stylish sun 
     glasses, arrived in Nagaland. With his diminutive and highly 
     pregnant travel companion, he had slipped past various Indian
     
     checkpoints and intelligence setups, and a fantastic journey 
     into hidden Burma began. 
     The book that resulted from this journey has become a classic 
     on recent Burmese history. Bertil and Hseng Noung Lintner spent 
     one and a half years travelling through northern and eastern 
     Burma from 1985 to 1987. Lintner describes with care and deep 
     insight the struggle by the Kachin and Shan ethnic groups 
     against Burmese army rule, and records the decline and fall of 
     the CPB--the Communist Party of Burma. During their 2,275 
     kilometre trek, at times in great danger, they wrote the 
     history of a 40-year forgotten war, a history which would 
     otherwise never have been committed to paper in such rich 
     detail. Their daughter Hseng Tai was born in Nagaland in India 
     at the inception of the journey. The 1996 edition is updated, 
     and contains a wealth of hitherto unpublished photographic 
     material as well as detailed maps and plans.

     Among the many memorable books on travels in Burma before the 
     Second World War, Somerset Maugham's leisurely progress from
     
     London via Colombo, then up the Irrawaddy to Mandalay and 
     onwards through the then peaceful Shan States to Thailand and 
     Cambodia ranks among the most enjoyable. He was not only a 
     sharp-eyed observer of human nature but writes about his 
     encounters with a good deal of emphatic quite uncommon among 
     travel writers of the 1920's.

                           December 3, 1996<p> 
     

     
        The United States cautioned Burma's military rulers Tuesday against 
     harming
     protesters involved in the country's biggest student demonstration 
     since 1988.
     
        Nearly 2,000 students of the Yangon (Rangoon) Institute of 
     Technology took
     part in a peaceful 20-hour protest which started on their campus 
     Monday before
     spilling into the streets of central Rangoon before sunrise Tuesday.  
     <p>
        Students said they were protesting against what they termed police
     manhandling of colleagues involved in a brawl with restaurant owners 
     in October.
     
        "We are calling upon the SLORC (Burmese government) to respect the 
     rights of
     the demonstrators to assemble peacefully in the streets of the city 
     and to
     express their views," said State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns.
     
        "We believe that no harm should come to them, no use of force 
     should be taken
     against them," Burns told reporters.
     <p>
        The Burmese government should listen to students and to the 
     opposition
     National League for Democracy, led by Nobel peace laureate Aung San 
     Suu Kyi,
     "and engage in a systematic conversation with them about the future of 
     the
     country", he said.
     <p>
        Washington has slapped a visa ban on senior SLORC (State Law and 
     Order
     Rsetoration Council) officials and has passed legislation allowing 
     President
     Clinton to impose economic sanctions if repression in Burma worsens.

     Reuters World Service<br>
     
                          November 13, 1996, Wednesday <p>
 
     BANGKOK, 
        Thai prime ministerial hopefuls Chuan Leekpai and Chavalit 
     Yongchaiyudh said
     on Wednesday they would allow human rights groups to hold protests 
     here against
     Rangoon's crackdown on democracy activities in Burma.
     
        Chuan and Chavalit, frontrunners to lead a coalition government 
     after
     November 17 polls, said if elected they both would strive to persuade 
     Burma to
     improve its human rights record.
<p>     
        Chuan, prime minister in 1992-1995, said in a televised debate with 
     his rival
     that the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) should review 
     Burma's
     human rights performance before granting Rangoon membership in the 
     regional
     group.  
     <p>
        ASEAN groups Thailand with Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, 
     Singapore,
     Brunei and Vietnam.
     <p>
        Chuan said if elected, he would try to maintain Thailand's policy 
     of
     constructive engagement toward Burma. He said Bangkok should continue 
     balancing
     its national interests of maintaining friendly relations with Burma 
     without
     ignoring human rights violation by its neighbour.
     <p>
        Defence Minister Chavalit said he also would not obstruct Thai 
     activist
     groups holding rallies here in support of Burmese democracy leader 
     Aung San Suu
     Kyi.
     
        But the former army chief said Thailand should focus on persuading 
     the
     Burmese military government to heed international calls for improving 
     its human
     rights performance.
     <p>
        Burma's military rulers have come under steady international 
     criticism over
     their human rights policy. They in recent months detained and then 
     released
     hundreds of Suu Kyi's supporters.
     <p>
        Chuan's Democrat Party and Chavalit's New Aspiration Party are 
     expected to
     each win 120-130 seats in Thailand's new 393-seat lower House of 
     Representatives
     on Sunday.
     
        Touching on Thai election issues, Chavalit denied suggestions by 
     his critics
     that he favoured big military spending but he said there was room for 
     Thailand
     to trim its growing national coffers of over 300 billion baht ($12 
     billion).
     
        He said large government surplus funds, a product of eight 
     consecutive years
     of fiscal surpluses, should be partly invested by the public sector to 
     offset
     a slowdown of the Thai economy this year. He did not elaborate.
     
        The Thai economy is projected to expand about seven percent in 
     1996, its
     slowest pace in 10 years.

PARIS, Nov 13<p>
     

        France on Wednesday condemned an attack on Burmese democracy leader 
     Aung San
     Suu Kyi's motorcade five days ago and called for democracy talks in 
     the country.
     
        "France deplores actions committed at the weekend against several 
     members of
     the National League for Democracy," Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques 
     Rummelhardt told reporters.  
     
        "France calls once again for moderation and the launch of a proper 
     dialogue
     between all parties," he added.
<p>     
        Several other countries including the United States, Britain and 
     Japan have
     condemned the Saturday incident in which stones were thrown at the 
     Nobel Peace
     prize laureate's motorcade. She has said the Rangoon attack was 
     government-orchestrated.
     
        Burma's military rulers have come under steady international 
     criticism over
     their human rights policy.
     
        Suu Kyi and the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) are 
     in a
     standoff over her demand for greater democracy in Burma since her 
     release in
     July 1995 from six years of house arrest.
     
        The SLORC has detained and then released hundreds of her NLD party 
     supporters
     and members at various times to pressure her.

November 11, 1996 <br>
 International Peace Bureau <br>
 <p>    
     In the wake of international media reports from Rangoon at the 
     weekend, 
     the International Peace Bureau calls on its fellow Nobel Peace Prize 
     winners, its 160 member organizations and all democratic governments 
     to 
     protest in the strongest possible terms the latest outrages committed 
     by 
     the illegal SLORC regime against  Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. On 
     Saturday 9 November Ms Suu Kyi and her colleagues were physically 
     attacked by a 200-strong mob using stones and iron bars. A man 
     wielding 
     a knife attacked the car carrying Suu Kyi, though fortunately she 
     herself was not injured.
     <p>
     This alarming incident comes just days before the APEC and ASEAN 
     summits in
     Manila and thus ensures that the issue of Burma - always an 
     embarrassment for the governments of the region - will be high on the 
     agenda.
     <p>
     IPB urges all friends of democracy to strengthen the trade and 
     investment  boycott of the SLORC regime and to continue to insist that 
     the SLORC must hand over power to the elected representatives of the 
     Burmese
     people.

November 11, 1996<p>
     
         RANGOON, Nov. 11 (Reuters) - A U.S. senator said on Monday
     during a visit to Rangoon he had urged Burma's military 
     government to hold talks with Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu 
     Kyi and set a deadline for the writing of a new constitution.
     
     John McCain, a Republican senator from Arizona, said he met 
     Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt, head of military intelligence and 
     Secretary One of the ruling State Law and Order Restoration 
     Council (SLORC), during a one-day visit to the country.
     
     'In our meetings we...expressed the American people's belief 
     that dialogue between Burmese authorities, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi 
     and the NLD (National League for Democracy), was indispensable 
     to progress toward national reconciliation, and should begin 
     now,' McCain said in a statement upon leaving Rangoon.
     <p>
     He did not say what the response was from the government.
     
     McCain's statement repeated comments made earlier by U.S. 
     Charge d'Affairs Kent Wiedemann, and said the United States was
     deeply concerned about a weekend attack on Suu Kyi and had asked 
     for government assurance that the incident would not be 
     repeated.
     
     McCain said he also urged the government to set a timetable
     to complete drafting a new constitution, and to hold a 'free and 
     fair' national referendum.
     <p>
     A National Convention of hand-picked delegates has been
     meeting intermittently since 1993, at the whim of the SLORC, to 
     draft guidelines for the constitution.
     
     The government has said the convention will reconvene this 
     year, but did not give a date for when the charter would be 
     finished.
     <p>
     Suu Kyi angered the SLORC last year when she pulled the NLD
     out of the convention, saying the process was not democratic and 
     did not represent the will of the people.
     <p>
     The United States has been a leader among Western nations in 
     its condemnation of the SLORC's suppression of democracy in 
     Burma and its refusal to hold talks with Suu Kyi.

     Washington slapped a travel ban prohibiting senior SLORC 
     officials and their families from visiting the United States. 
     Burma immediately authorized a reciprocal ban.
     
     A senior military official said McCain was allowed to travel 
     to Rangoon and meet top officials because the SLORC felt his 
     visit could be helpful to bilateral relations.
<p>     
     'We believe whoever comes in with an open mind can help us 
     work for a better relationship,' the official told Reuters.

     car was

         TOKYO, Nov. 11 (Reuters) - Japan voiced regret on Monday over
     an attack on Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's 
     motorcade and said it would call on the military government to
     
     show restraint in dealing with the Nobel laureate.
<p>     
     'There had been signs that communications channels between
     the (Burmese) government and Suu Kyi were being restored,' top 
     government spokesman Seiroku Kajiyama told a news conference.
     
     'Therefore, it is extremely regrettable that the incident 
     happened,' he said.
     
     'We will continue to ask the Myanmar (Burma) government for 
     restraint,' Kajiyama said.

November 11, 1996  
     <p>
           LONDON, Nov. 11 (Reuters) - Britain on Monday condemned an 
     attack on
     Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's motorcade and said the 
     military
     government had to take responsibility.
     
         The Nobel Peace prize laureate, who was unhurt when stones were 
     thrown at
     her motorcade on Saturday afternoon, has said the attack was 
     government
     orchestrated.
     
         The government has said it is investigating the incident.
     <p>
         But a British foreign office spokesman said on Monday: ``We 
     condemn the
     attacks on Aung Sang Suu Kyi and other leaders of the National League 
     for
     Democracy in Rangoon on 9 November.
     
         ``The State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) must take
     responsibility for this blatant and crude attempt to intimidate 
     democratic
     politicians. It is a deplorable step backwards.
     
         ``We call on the SLORC to guarantee the safety and freedom of all 
     those
     conducting democratic political activities. We again urge them to 
     respond
     constructively to calls for dialogue and to prevent further 
     deterioration of
     the situation in Burma.''
     <p>
         Suu Kyi's opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) party 
     said on
     Sunday it would not be provoked by Saturday's attack, the first of its 
     kind
     against her.

<title> EU THREATENS TO REVOKE TRADE PRIVILEGES SOON

EU THREATENS TO REVOKE TRADE PRIVILEGES SOON

November 11, 1996<br>
     NUSSARA SAWATSAWANG<br>
     
 Members of the European Parliament said the EU will revoke its privileges to
     Burma within a "week" unless it is allowed to investigate forced labor 
     accusations against the military junta.
     
     The withdraw of trade privileges offered under the Generalized System 
     of
     Preferences will seriously hurt the textile industry in Burma which 
     relies
     heavily on European countries for its exports.
     <p>
     Glenys Kinnock and Glyn Ford, British members of European Parliament, 
     made
     the remarks Saturday night at the Foreign Correspondents Club of 
     Thailand
     after returning from Rangoon where they met pro-democracy leader Aung 
     San
     Suu Kyi.
     
     They held talks with Mrs. Suu Kyi on Friday.
     
     According to Mrs. Kinnock the European Commission agreed in September 
     that
     the evidence of use of forced labor provided by NGOs was "sufficient 
     to
     justify" the withdraw of GSP privileges to Burma but France, through 
     its
     foreign minister, vetoed the resolution during a meeting of EU foreign 
     ministers on Oct. 29 arguing that the commission "could not just 
     listen to
     one side of the argument.
     <p>
     France then proposed a fact-finding mission be sent to Burma and 
     members of
     the military regime be included in the team to look into the 
     accusations.
     
     France's posture, she said, was influenced by Total, a France oil 
     company
     with extensive interests in Burma.
     
     The EU was a awaiting Burmese response but she said it is highly 
     unlikely
     that Rangoon would accept the proposal.
     
     Mr. Ford affirmed Burma's trade privileges will go soon.
     
     "I'm not aware of any deadline but just be clear that we're talking 
     about
     weeks, not years. We're talking about a few weeks to let Slorc explain 
     what
     is happening in Burma," he said.
     <p>
     Mrs. Kinnock said they will meet with EU commissioner Manuel Marlin 
     tomorrow
     
     in Brussels to tell him "of the urgency for quick action."
     <p>
     While in Burma, Mr. Ford said, they saw no direct evidence of forced 
     labor
     but the groups they met and the they people they talked to confirmed 
     the
     practice was widespread.
     
     In Burma Mrs. Kinnock and Mr. Ford visited a charity hospital, 
     observed a
     village relocation project and spoke to religious groups and 
     opposition
     leaders but they were unable to get in tough with Slorc officials 
     because
     they were went through on tourist visas.
     
     Mrs. Kinnock said the revocation of GSP status was an important first 
     step
     because it will have a direct bearing on Burma's textile industry.
     
     The countries of the European Union, especially Britain, are major 
     importers
     of Burmese textile.
     <p>
     The EU will push for economic sanctions against Burma, said Mrs. 
     Kinnock,
     who delivered a keynote speech on Burma to the European Parliament in 
     Strasbourg recently.
     
     Britain, France and Germany are opposed to EU economic sanctions in 
     Burma
     but Mrs. Kinnock and Mr. Ford asserted that public pressure could 
     eventually
     force them to toe the EU line.
     <p>
     Following their talks last Friday, Mrs. Kinnock quoted Mrs. Suu Kyi, 
     the
     1991-Nobel Peace Laureate, as saying that EU's axing of GSP privileges 
     and
     its push for economic sanctions against Burma will dent SLORC's 
     confidence
     and send a clear signal to ASEAN.
     
     "She (Suu Kyi) is very clear that we (EU) should be very strong 
     because the
     ASEAN countries would respond accordingly," she said.
     
     "Aung San Suu Kyi is very keen to see the EU and the United States put 
     pressure on ASEAN, using their leverage to make sure that Burma is not 
     admitted as full member of the organization," Mr. Ford added.
     <p>
     Last month the European Parliament called on the Association of 
     Southeast
     Asian Nations to reject Burma's request to speed up membership to 
     grouping,
     saying it could strain the relations between the EU and ASEAN.
     
     Mrs. Kinnock said the relationship between ASEAN and EU should also 
     take
     into account human rights issues. (BP)

GLOBAL CONSCIENCE - REMINDING THE WORLD THAT HUMAN RIGHTS 
 ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO OF OUR HUMANITY
     
     
     
New York, NY - There is a serious myth fostered by corporations, 
governments, advertising media, and powerful individuals in the 
world today.  The myth is that economic growth, at whatever 
cost, will create a healthier and happier civilization.  Nowhere 
in the picture is the priority of securing human rights.  In the 
week prior to the observance of Human Rights Day on December 10, 
individuals and organizations throughout the world will reflect 
on the importance and meaning of "humanity" as it extends from 
the individual to our global community. We ask that individuals 
and leaders throughout the world do the same.
     
Each year passes and we are witness to the images of advancement 
and the images of horror and it is this reality which bring to 
mind that perhaps our world is on the brink of irreversible 
disaster rather than progress and prosperity.  And yet, at the 
same time, advances in information technology have made it 
difficult to hide the fact that the rapid destruction and 
sinocization of Tibet threatens all Tibetans within the occupied 
nation of Tibet.  So, we are also witness to the hope of a 
globally enlightened community whereby knowledge can lead to the 
change required to both sustain and nurture rather than destroy 
our world.
     
This change cannot happen without the actions of individuals and 
communities throughout the world.  As sponsors of the December 
10, 1996 "Day of Observance for Prisoners of Conscience" 
throughout the world, Students for a Free Tibet (SFT) and the 
Regional Tibetan Youth Congress of New York and New Jersey will 
be joined by others who believe that integrating human rights 
into personal, national and international practices and policies 
is a necessity for local and global security and survival. 
     
December 10th will be marked by events including a fast for such 
people as the Nobel Peace Prize candidate Wei Jingsheng, 
pro-democracy student leader Wang Dan, the world's youngest 
prisoner of conscience, the 7-year old Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, 
Tibet's 11th Panchen Lama, and the countless numbers of other 
courageous individuals who remain imprisoned for exercising 
beliefs that are fundamental to their own view of humanity.  The 
fast will occur at Ralphe Bunche Park on 42nd and 1st Ave. 
across the UN from 9am to 5pm and will be followed by a march on 
42nd St. to 6th Ave, up 47th St. to Duffy Square Park off 47th 
and Broadway in Times Square from 5:00 to 5:30pm.  A candlelight 
vigil with special guest speakers representing a coalition of 
groups will take place at Duffy Square Park, in the triangle of 
Times Square, off 47th and Broadway from 5:30pm to 7:30pm. 
Please contact 212-481-3569 for further information.

     Agence France Presse<br>
     
                               December 03, 1996<p>
          A Burmese drug official Tuesday acknowledged that a large portion 
     of the world's heroin supply was produced in his country but rejected US 
     criticism of his government's anti-narcotics efforts.
     "It is an undeniable fact that Myanmar (Burma) accounts for the 
     major  production of opium in the infamous Golden Triangle area," where the 
     borders of Burma, Thailand and Laos meet, Colonel Kyaw Thein said.
But hundreds of soldiers had sacrificed their lives and thousands 
     of kilograms (pounds) of contraband had been confiscated since the junta 
     took power in 1988, he said at the government's monthly press conference Tuesday. 
     <p>
             Kyaw Thein is a senior intelligence official in the defense 
     ministry's Office of Strategic Studies and a member of the central committee for drug 
     abuse control.  He assailed a "cheap shot" taken by US Assistant Secretary of State 
     Robert Gelbard, who attacked Burma's record on drug control in an article 
     published in the November 21 edition of the Hong Kong-based Far East Economic 
     Review.
     <p>
        Gelbard said Burma was a minor player in the drug trade before the 
     military took power in 1962 but that it then began allowing ethnic militias on 
     the borders to produce opium unhindered in return for help in maintaining 
     stability.<p>

        The country became the world's largest opium producer in the 1980s 
     and, since the ruling junta was formed in 1988, opium production in Burma has 
     doubled, healleged. Gelbard accused the junta of money laundering, citing a state press 
     report in August that the head of the United Wa State Army, which Gelbard 
     described as "East Asia's largest heroin-trafficking organisation," had just 
     purchased part of a Rangoon office building.
     <p>
        Kyaw Thein told reporters there was no money laundering in Burma 
     "due to our
     strict banking laws."
     
        The Burmese narcotics official cited the junta's cooperation with 
     US drug and
     agriculture agencies in monitoring opium yields and its accession to 
     UN
     anti-drug conventions and regional agreements signed in 1991, 1995 and 
     again in May 1996.                                                     
     
     
        The country was also forced to use its own limited resources in its 
     fight
     against drugs, while neighboring governments received much larger 
     amounts of
     outside assistance, Kyaw Thein said.
     <p>
        Saying the allegations were obviously based on erroneous and 
     slanted reports
     prepared by "some prejudiced US officials," Kyaw Thein said Gelbard 
     should,
     instead of attacking Burma, have "dealt constructively with the 
     serious issue of
     cooperation."

December 16, 1996<br>
     by Dennis Bernstein and Leslie Kean<br>
     
<center><h2>     Burma's dictatorship of Drugs</h2></center>
     
      Burma - or Myanmar, more formally - makes the Western news pages 
     mostly for its repression of the struggling democracy movement led by 
     Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who is continually harassed and 
     was recently physically attacked while trying to address her 
     followers. But those who dare to take a serious approach to drug eradication are 
     likely to end up in deadlier trouble with the ruling dictatorship, known as the 
     State Law and Order Restoration Council, or SLORC, which has incorporated 
     the booming heroin trade into the permanent economy of the country. 
      Consider the case of U Saw Lu, a revered leader in the 
     mountainous poppy- growing region of the Wa territory, one of many 
     ethnic regions in Burma.  Lu, a Wa prince and chairman of the United 
     Wa State Anti-Narcotics and Development Organization, has waged a risky 
     opium eradication campaign on behalf of his people since the SLORC seized 
     power in a 1988 coup.
<p>
      In January 1992, after U Saw Lu informed the U.S. Drug 
     Enforcement Administration about the drug trafficking activities of a 
     regional SLORC intelligence chief and a local drug warlord, he found 
     himself face to face with a torture squad. According to D.E.A. 
     "Sensitive"
     e-mail,  "he was held upside down for 56 days with 220 current 
     attached to
     one of his favorite appendages."  A doctor who remained present 
     through the 
     torture sessions revived Lu when he passed out. Urine was poured on 
     his face
     and he was beaten with chains as he lay near death next to a freshly 
     dug grave. 
     His life was spared after Wa leaders threatened military action during 
     a meeting with SLORC's head of military intelligence, Lieut. Gen. Khin 
     Nyunt.
<p>
      "There were terrible scars all over his body after the torture," 
     said Benjamin Min, a former SLORC official from Rangoon, who quit the 
     dictatorship and joined Lu in his war against drugs. "He had internal 
     injuries and he needed medical attention."
       Maj. Than Aye, the intelligence officer Lu had told the D.E.A. 
     about, supervised the torture sessions. The drug shipment Aye had been 
     overseeing was on its way to one of the world's most notorious drug 
     kingpins, Lo Hsing Han, destined to become a key business partner of 
     Burma's
     emerging narco-dictatorship. Major Aye has since been promoted to a 
     high-level government position by the ruling council. 
      According to Benjamin Min, Lu continued to work on opium 
     eradication even though he was warned during his torture to terminate 
     any relationship with the D.E.A. In 1993, Lu gave D.E.A. special agent 
     Richard Horn a document titled "The Bondage of Opium: The Agony of the 
     Wa People, a Proposal and Plea."
<p>
      In his plea, Lu outlined specific steps that were needed to 
     promote opium eradication among the Wa farmers, who provide 80 percent 
     of Burma's opium crop. The Wa, an ethnic minority of 1 million, live 
     in a remote area of Burma's Shan State where there are no roads, no 
     educational system, no medical clinics and electricity for less than 10 percent of 
     families.  Even though the Wa farmers grow one of the globe's most sought- after 
     crops, they remain among the world's poorest peoples. Lu knew that any 
     hope of 
     change had to include a serious plan for crop substitution. "Like the 
     heroin addicts that result from the opium, we too are in bondage. We 
     are searching for help to break that bondage," he wrote in his 
     proposal to the 
     D.E.A.
<p>
      Communications between the D.E.A.'s Rangoon office and the higher 
     officials in Washington reveal that agent Horn had every intention of 
     working with the Wa people to implement Lu's proposal. But for reasons 
     that remain unclear, the Central Intelligence Agency and the State 
     Department had other ideas. D.E.A. Sensitive e-mails state that former 
     C.I.A. Chief of 
     Station Arthur Brown "destroyed this project in one swift move."  
     According to the e-mails, Brown delivered an early version of the Wa 
     proposal - 
     signed by Lu - to SLORC military intelligence officer Col. Kyaw Thein. 
     When Thein threatened to pick up Lu once more and teach him a lesson 
     in respect, Horn was able to intervene temporarily.  In Horn's view, the 
     C.I.A. destroyed a unique opportunity for a dramatic drug eradication program 
     in the poppy fields of the world's biggest heroin producer. (Horn, now 
     a D.E.A. group supervisor in New Orleans, is suing the C.I.A., 
     claiming it illegally surveyed his residence in Rangoon to gain information about 
     his plans, which the CIA went on to foil.)  
<p>
      In September 1993, Horn was forced out of the country by the 
     State Department under pressure from the C.I.A. The plans of the Wa 
     Prince and his chief deputy, Benjamin Min, were crushed.  A year 
     later, Min risked his life to take the Wa Proposal and Plea to policy-makers 
     in Washington.  Before he left, the SLORC hatched a series of 
     unsuccessful assassination plots. In his sworn testimony to the Immigration and 
     Naturalization Service, which won him asylum in the United States, Min 
     states, "Their aim was to assassinate the Wa leaders, specifically U 
     Saw Lu and myself as his chief deputy." 
     
     <center><h2>Dirty Laundry</h2></center>
     
      Burma has more than doubled its illicit drug exports since the 
     SLORC takeover in 1988. The U.S. Embassy in Rangoon reports that the 
     area used for poppy cultivation in Burma increased by two-thirds 
     between 1987 and 1990. At a United Nations Drug Control Program 
     (U.N.D.C.P.)
     regional conference in November of 1993, French and American satellite 
     surveys were presented showing an explosion of poppy growing in areas 
     directly under SLORC control.
      The U.N.D.C.P. also reported at the U.N.-sponsored Heads of 
     Narcotics Law Enforcement Agencies international meeting this November 
     that the Asian heroin trade reaps $63 billion in profits annually.  
     Burma is by far the largest exporter in the region, providing over 50 
     percent of the world's supply.
      This booming heroin trade has sent a flood of narco-dollars into 
     Rangoon. "All normal economic activities, if you can call anything in 
     Burma normal, are instruments of drug money laundering," says Francois 
     Casanier, research analyst with Geopolitical Drugwatch in Paris. "And 
     no drug operation in Burma can be run without the SLORC." A March 1996 
     narcotics report on Burma by the US State Department points out that 
     the country's "underdeveloped banking system and lack of enforcement 
     against money laundering have created a business and investment environment 
     conducive to the use of drug-related proceeds in legitimate commerce." 
<p>
      A study by the International Monetary Fund cites large expenditures 
     unaccounted for by  the Burmese government: Despite the fact that Burma's foreign exchange 
     reserves for 1991 through 1993 were only  approximately $300 million, 
     the SLORC purchased arms valued at $1.2 billion during the period.   
      According to a 1995 report on Burma's drug trade, the Australian 
     Parliament Committee of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade heard 
     testimony that Burma's "narcotics trade was protected at the highest 
     level of the Government" and that the SLORC's involvement occurs "on 
     an individual basis for personal profit, covering areas of responsibility 
     for transport,  protection and patronage; and as a matter of policy, either explicit 
     or  covert, in order to raise government revenue." The integration of narco dollars into the national economy is  further highlighted by a new economic report from the U.S. Embassy in 
     Rangoon.  Released in July, the "Country Commercial Guide" states that 
     at least 50 percent of Burma's economy is unaccounted for and 
     extralegal.
<p>
     "Exports of opiates alone appear to be worth about as much as all 
     legal exports,"  the report says. The eighty-eight-page document is based on the 
     SLORC's  own economic data. It goes on to say that investments in 
     infrastructure and hotels are coming from major opiate growing and opiate exporting 
     organizations and from those with close ties to these organizations. 
     "Barriers between the opiates sector and the legal economy appear to 
     have weakened in recent years, a trend that may have accelerated in the 
     last few months," it explains.
<p>
      A four-year investigation conducted by intelligence analyst 
     Casanier and a team of researchers found that Burma's national company 
     Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) was "the main channel for 
     laundering the revenues of heroin produced and exported under the 
     control of the Burmese army."  In a business deal signed with the French oil 
     giant Total in 1992, and later joined by Unocal, MOGE received a payment of 
     $15 million.  "Despite the fact that MOGE has no assets besides the 
     limited installments of its  foreign partners and makes no profit, and that the Burmese state never 
     had the capacity to allocate any currency credit to MOGE, the 
     Singapore  bank accounts of this company have seen the transfer of hundreds of 
     millions of U.S. dollars," reports Casanier.  According to a confidential MOGE 
     file reviewed by the investigators, funds exceeding $60 million and 
     originating from Burma's most renowned drug lord, Khun Sa, were channeled through 
     the company.  "Drug money is irrigating every economic activity in Burma," 
     Casanier says, "and big foreign partners are also seen by the SLORC as 
     big shields for money laundering." 
<p>
      Astonishingly, drug money is actually solicited by Burma's 
     state-controlled banks. The national bank in Rangoon openly provides money-laundering 
     services, turning drug money into clean money for a 40 percent cut. 
     Occasionally official announcements run in the state-controlled press 
     promoting specials at a reduced charge of 25 percent, no questions 
     asked. Bertil Lintner, a noted authority on Burma's drug trade, says there is 
     a private banking boom in Rangoon based on the influx of narco-dollars.
     
     <center><h2>Father and Son: A Drug Legacy</h2></center>
     
     
      The SLORC's close relationship with Burma's most powerful drug 
     traffickers was revealed to the world at this past spring's wedding celebration of 
     entrepreneur Steven Law, son of legendary druglord Lo Hsing Han, who 
     as of 1994 controlled the most heavily armed drug-trafficking organization 
     in Southeast Asia.  It is doubtful that anyone attending this lavish 
     affair was thinking about the torture suffered by U Saw Lu for trying to impede 
     Han's drug trade back in 1992.  The family's guest of honor was Hotels and 
     Tourism Minister Lieut. Gen. Kyaw Ba, whose presence, along with three other 
     SLORC ministers and four Cabinet ministers, lent strong political overt 
     ones to the celebration.  Other well known traffickers were also in 
     attendance. The event received significant exposure in the New Light 
     of  Myanmar, the state-controlled paper.
<p>
      Lo Hsing Han's drug links to top levels of the SLORC are well 
     documented. A memo from the Thai Government's Office of Narcotics Control Board 
     names the  SLORC's military intelligence chief, Lieut. Gen. Khin Nyunt, as one 
     "supporter."  It goes on to say that in February 1993, Lo Hsing Han 
     was granted the "privilege from Brig. Gen. Khin Nyunt to smuggle heroin 
     from the Kokang group to Tachilek [on the Thai border] without interception." 
      Steven Law is the managing director of Asia World Company Limited, a
     trading and development firm in Rangoon whose chairman is his father, 
     Lo Hsing Han. Founded in 1992, Asia World reports it's "authorized 
     capital" to have been $40 million, and it has since invested an estimated $200 
     million in construction projects around Rangoon. In a joint venture with the 
     SLORC, Law's company was given a twenty-five-year contract in April for a new 
     wharf at Yangon Port, which handles over 90 percent of Burma's exports. With 
     the SLORC's blessings, one of the world's biggest heroin traffickers will 
     thus own and operate a port sending ships loaded with cargo to the United 
     States and countries around the world. (While Steven Law is being honored in 
     Burma, he has been forbidden entrance into the United States due to 
     "suspicion of involvement in narcotics trafficking," according to a US State 
     Department official who asked not to be named.)
     
<center><h2>     'Our Own Blood Brethren'</h2></center>
     
      The SLORC's budding relationship with the recently "surrendered" Khun 
     Sa, the world's most wanted heroin smuggler, was by all accounts a leap 
     forward  in the junta's solidification of the narco-dictatorship. In January of
      this year, the SLORC ceremoniously welcomed Khun Sa and his 
     associates into Rangoon as "our own blood brethren." Intelligence chief Khin Nyunt 
     said in a speech that "we will look after them well on humanitarian grounds and 
     for the sake of national spirit." Drug expert Bertil Lintner sums up the 
     reality of the situation: "Khun Sa's 'surrender' has brought the last warlord 
     out of the jungles and into Rangoon - where he, like everybody else these 
     days, can continue his business. Millions of dollars have been transferred from 
     bank accounts abroad to Rangoon since Khun Sa settled there."
      The deal for Khun Sa's new alliance with the SLORC was negotiated by
     SLORC's  Defense Commander Gen. Maung Aye and Khun Sa's uncle in 
     Rangoon in December 1995. It was highly fitting that the powerful hard-liner 
     Maung Aye should serve as negotiator. In his previous post as head of the 
     Eastern Command, the area in which Khun Sa maintained his drug operations, 
     numerous sources report that Maung Aye was on Khun Sa's payroll for allowing 
     drug operations to continue unimpeded. He has since been promoted to 
     Vice-Chairman, the second most powerful position in the SLORC, and is 
     expected to succeed the Chairman, Gen. Than Shwe, when he retires.
      This past spring,  Khun Sa was given a commercial bus concession from
      Rangoon into Shan State, the location of his drug empire along the 
     China border.  His third son, Sam Seun, is investing $20 million in the 
     development of a forty-four-acre plot that was presented as a gift to Khun Sa by 
     the SLORC at the time of their deal. As reported by the Bangkok Post, the 
     tourist facility, situated along the Thai border, will include a 
     gambling casino, large hotel and "other forms of entertainment." Thai officials 
     are worried about the increase in drug trafficking and money laundering 
     that will result from Khun Sa's family enterprise.
<p>
      In previous years, the SLORC had claimed it could not crack down on 
     drugs due to Khun Sa's control of Shan State and that his surrender would 
     result in a substantial reduction in drug exports. "On the contrary, there 
     will be more opium," Khun Sa mused a few months before securing his deal, 
     knowing that it would give the SLORC  access to his refineries in Shan State. 
     Banpot Piamdee, head of the Northern Narcotics Prevention and 
     Suppression Centre in Thailand, and international narcotics agents confirmed that 
     Khun Sa's surrender has done absolutely nothing to stem the flow of heroin 
     out of Burma. In fact, the US State Department's annual opium survey shows 
     that this year's harvest was 9% larger than last year's. Winston Lord, 
     Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific, called the SLORC's 
     new partnership with Khun Sa a "defeat for the control of drugs in all our 
     countries."
<p>
The Shan Herald Agency for News reported on August 2 that the heroin
     refineries in the jungles of Khun Sa's territory, owned by two of the 
     druglord's followers, had stopped functioning for two months when the 
     Burmese occupied the area at the time of Khun Sa's departure for 
     Rangoon. However, refinery operators were given the green light by SLORC troops 
     in mid-March and are back in full swing, "enjoying more freedom than 
     before." The Bangkok Post reported on August 21 that "Rangoon has officially 
     allowed former Mong Tai Army soldiers [Khun Sa's army] and Shan People at Ho 
     Mong [Khun Sa's former headquarters] to grow opium poppies to ease poverty 
     in the area."
<p>
      Along with Lo Hsing Han and Khun Sa, other ethnic drug traffickers 
     have also benefited from good relationships with the Rangoon junta, 
     according to this spring's State Department Narcotics Report.  Following a list of 
     the names of eight top traffickers from the Shan, Kachin and Wa areas, the 
     report points out that the SLORC has given these individuals 
     "significant political legitimacy" by referring to them as "leaders of national 
     races." Several of them have even been handpicked to help write the nation's 
     new Constitution.  It is hardly surprising that the SLORC refused a U.S. 
     offer of $2 million to extradite Khun Sa to stand trial here.  (Khun Sa was 
     indicted in a US federal court in December 1989 on charges of 
     smuggling more than $350 million worth of heroin into the U.S. between 1986 and 
     1989.)
<p>
Outside of Rangoon, SLORC local commanders and their brigades carry 
     out policies that actively promote the expansion of poppy growing. 
     Payoffs, kickbacks and extortion by the military in connection with opium 
     growing and drug transport are factors of daily life for most villagers. Due to 
     cease-fire agreements signed with fifteen ethnic minorities since 
     1989, the SLORC army now has full access to every border in Burma and control of 
     border check points for the first time.  Geopolitical Drugwatch researcher Casanier says that SLORC army  officials extort "taxes" from impoverished opium growers to supplement their 
     meager salaries.  This monthly, per-acre extortion forces villagers to 
     continue farming opium simply to be able to meet the tax quota, thereby 
     keeping them dependent on the cash crop.  If villagers do not deliver, their 
     livestock is confiscated, family members are held for ransom, or they are taken 
     away and used as forced labor on infrastructure projects. The less 
     lucky ones, usually the village headmen, are arrested and tortured. 
      SLORC Minister for Hotels and Tourism Lieut. Gen. Kyaw Ba, the guest 
     of honor at Steven Law's wedding, became rich from drug payoffs, 
     according to several sources,  when he served as Northern Commander in Kachin State 
     prior to his promotion to the SLORC.  Like many military commanders, he was 
     the beneficiary of a portion of the opium taxes and bribes that filter up 
     from battalions and the payoffs that come down from the drug lords. "Khun 
     Sa [has] paid 500,000 kyat ($5,000) a month since 1992 to one general who 
     was commanding this region," one officer of his army in Shan State told 
     Reuters.  Loong Kyong, a 45 year old Shan farmer who fled to Thailand, told 
     human rights investigators this past May that Burmese soldiers actually 
     encourage rice farmers to substitute opium for their rice crop. "The reason the 
     Burmese say not to grow rice is that if you grow rice you have to give 
     some to the rebel groups, and to others, and you have to get your rice 
     milled," he said. "So they say just grow opium and you can easily get money and 
     buy your rice.  The military will buy the opium." 
<p>
      All over Burma, rural communities are succumbing to the supplies of 
     cheap heroin distributed unchecked in their villages. "Drug users and retail 
     drug dealers can increasingly by found everywhere," reports the Shan Herald
      Agency for News. "Amphetamines and heroin are being bought and sold 
     like vegetables from roadside peddlers."  Rangoon and Mandalay, Burma's 
     second argest city, are also facing heroin epidemics.
      "Only since the 1988 SLORC takeover have chemicals needed to refine 
     the purest grades of heroin become available in Burma's most remote 
     areas," tates a drug eradication proposal presented by the people of Wa State 
     to the International Conference on Drugs in Portugal in March. "Local 
     militia groups, formerly opposed to the government and long-linked to the 
     heroin trade, now do business freely through SLORC-controlled frontier 
     areas."  The Australian Parliament Committee of Foreign Affairs was told last year 
     that "opium is warehoused at Burmese military bases, while trucks 
     transporting narcotics are sometimes escorted by military vehicles to avoid 
     inspection en route."
     <p>
      In Burma's northernmost Kachin state, things have also taken a turn 
     for the worse. Three years before the Kachin signed a cease fire agreement 
     with the SLORC in 1994,  Kachin leaders had mounted an "Opium Free State" 
     campaign that brought a drastic reduction in poppy cultivation to parts of 
     their territory. The 1996 report  "Current Status of Drug Eradication in 
     Kachin State" by the Kachin Independence Organization claims a 
     "dramatic...resurgence of poppy cultivation and opium production in 
     areas that were previously considered to be 90 per cent contained."  
<p>
      Benjamin Min, formerly with the SLORC Ministry of Mines, and  
     independent human rights investigators describe the devastating impact of drugs in 
     the jade mines of the remote Kachin State.  Managers of the SLORC-owned 
     mines, some in joint ventures with Chinese business men, are giving their 
     workers the option of receiving compensation in hard drugs rather than cash. 
     Up to 200,000 miners, who travel from their villages out of desperation for 
     work, can be found in one mine where drugs are cheap and shooting galleries 
     service hundreds with one needle.  Min reports that two thirds of the 
     100,000 workers at Hpakant Jade Mine, owned entirely by SLORC, have 
     chosen to be paid by drugs in lieu of cash.  And the only way large shipments 
     of  illegal substances can find their way into Kachin State is through 
     SLORC-controlled gates. More than 90 percent of the addicts in the 
     region are H.I.V. positive, according to a U.N. report.
<p>
      Kachin leaders and independent analysts believe that drugs are used 
     as a tacit tool of control by the military to pacify the Kachin population. 
      "In the Kachin people's minds, the heroin tragedy is a form of cultural 
     genocide for eliminating large portions of a volatile minority that has strong 
     sentiments against the government," stated a U.S. human rights 
     investigator who has managed to penetrate the restricted areas. Michael Jala Maran, 
     executive director of the Pan Kachin Development Society, returned to 
     Thailand in September from a distressful visit to Kachin State. "The 
     AIDS situation is a complete disaster," he said. "I'd call it the result of 
     the deliberate politics of heroin visited on the Kachin people since the 
     nefarious ceasefire." 
<p>
Needle sharing, a proliferation of brothels, a death of public 
     education and virtually no medical care have created an explosion in the number 
     of AIDS cases, with dangerous implications for the region. The U.N. 
     reports that 60-70 percent of IV drug users in Burma are H.I.V. positive. 
     (Even the SLORC acknowledges that there are more than 400,000 H.I.V. positive 
     people in Burma.) The World Health Organization figure for the overall number
      of addicts is close to 500,000, or 1 percent of the population, but 
     other experts say that a more realistic figure is 2 - 4 percent.  Millions 
     of migrants are pouring out of Burma into neighboring Thailand, China and 
     India, carrying H.I.V. with them.  The Southeast Asian Information 
     Network points to the dramatic correlations between the heroin routes out of 
     Burma and the rise of the AIDS epidemic in the country's neighbors.  The 
     highest rates of  H.I.V. infection in both China and India lie right at their 
     border with Burma. 
 <p>
      There is a direct correlation between the rise in heroin production 
     in Burma and a resurgence of heroin use in the last five years in the 
     United States. Government figures show that the volume of heroin imported 
     into this country, and likewise heroin consumption, has doubled since the 
     mid-eighties.  The amount of Burmese heroin sold in New York City has 
     tripled since 1989, according to Jane's Intelligence Review.  The 
     March State Department report and interviews with U.S. officials indicate 
     that more than  60 percent of heroin seized in the United States comes from 
     Burma. 
<p>
Madeleine Albright, U.S. ambassador to the U.N., recently described 
     Burma as closely resembling the Orwell novel 1984. "The authorities there 
     are among the most repressive and intrusive on earth," she said. "The rule 
     of law so ardently desired elsewhere has here been perverted for there is 
     no connection between justice and law." Yet this is a story that goes 
     beyond the usual realm of human rights: Burma's ruling junta appears willing 
     to addict an entire nation to drugs, both by setting up a long-term 
     financial dependency on the heroin trade and by fostering a massive upsurge in 
     drug usage.  And the enormous financial payout from the SLORC's pro-drug 
     policies helps the narco-dictatorship secure its hold on power against the 
     struggling democracy movement. 
<p>
       Meanwhile, the heroin pipeline from Burma to the United States 
     is opened up full blast, and mainlining has become trendy among U.S. 
     youth. San Francisco Police Sergeant John Murphy said in July that buying 
     heroin in his city is "as easy as buying a pack of cigarettes."

     Aung Zaw<p>
     
     Slorc's Visit Myanmar Year campaign has been plagued by problems, the 
     most recent being student protests. Aung Zaw reports on the less than 
     auspicious opening for the promotion. 
     <p>
     ON Nov 18, Burma's military  leaders kicked off the country's first 
     tourism campaign Visit Myanmar Year. Thirteen days later students took 
     to the streets to denounce the regime. Tanks were brought in and 
     soldiers and riot lice were deployed throughout the city to prevent 
     more protests.
     <p>
     At the height of the disturbance some tourists were kept from 
     returning to their hotels and at least two were accused of being 
     "reporters" and deported.
     <p>
     "I could not go anywhere I wanted," complained a tourist who was in 
     Rangoon last  week.
     <p>
     She was told by a hotel manger that last year had been a bumper year 
     for tourism operators but this year was "really bad".
     <p>
     A waiter joked that the street demonstrations marked the end of Visit 
     Myanmar  Year". This year is Visit Malar Year", he said. Malar in 
     Burmese basically means "not coming".
     <p>
     The ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council, however, expects 
     things to get better, projecting more than 250,000 tourists, up from 
     the 100,000 tourists who visited last year.
     <p>
     Burma's  powerful military  intelligence t chief and Slorc secretary 
     one, Lt Gen Khin Nyunt, officially opened the Visit Myanmar Year" 
     campaign, declaring that foreign visitors who visit the country will 
     see the true situation and realise that all the negative reports about 
     the country are fabrications.
     <p>
     He claimed that the junta has achieved peace and stability in Burma 
     and tourists could travel across the country without worry.
     <p>
     However, the Slorc's tourism campaign is not without problems.  
      <p>
     Since it decided to launch the Visit Myanmar Year" campaign the Slorc 
     has come under constant criticism at home and abroad. Activists and 
     dissidents have urged tour agencies not to promote Burma, saying that 
     the country's current military regime has committed mass human rights 
     abuses directly related to the promotion of tourism.
     <p>
     "Burma is the only country in the world where mass human rights abuses 
     directly related to promotion of tourism. Nearly two million people 
     were forced to work to restore roads, railway, temples and tourism 
     sites. So Burma is different from any other countries," says John 
     Jackson, spokesman for the London-based Burma Action Group.
      <p>
     In January, UN human rights rapporteur Yozo Yokota reported that Burma 
     may be using force labour to restore landmarks for foreign tourists in 
     an effort to Visit  Myanmar Year. He cited allegations that Burma is 
     using forced labour to restore
     such tourists sites as Mandalay Palace and upgrade the country's 
     railways.
     <p>
     "The tourism business will benefit not the people of Burma but Slorc," 
     said the Burma Action Group.
     <p>
     "Tourists must also be aware of that dollars brought into the country 
     and put into the hands of the Slorc are being used to sustain military 
     spending which takes up a huge proportion of the annual budget, and is 
     used by the Slorc to wage a campaign against its own people," it 
     charged.
     <p>
     Lt Gen Kyaw Ba counters that tourism will benefit the people of Burma. 
     He said that the US$70 million (Bt .75 billion) earned by the tourism 
     industry in 1995-96, only $5 million went to the government.
      <p>
     Nevertheless, the Melbourne-based Australian Council for Overseas Aid 
     (Acfoa) said the Slorc dominates the economy and has large financial 
     interests in tourism.
     <p>
     Janet Hunt, Acfoa executive director urged  people not to support the 
     regime or condone their abuses" by travelling to Burma during Slorc's 
     tourism campaign.
     <p>
     Tens of thousands of Burmese people  have been rounded up by the army 
     to slave on projects like the dredging of  the Mandalay  palace moat 
     or building runways for the new  airport at Bassein. Forced labour is 
     endemic in Burma," she said.
     <p>
     So should tourists shun Burma?
<p>
     "In the longer term we don't want to isolate the Burmese people, but 
     during Visit - Myanmar year Acfoa is calling on all Australian 
     travellers and Australian travel companies to condemn this abuse of 
     human rights in Burma and to withhold their support for the Slorc's 
     tourism campaign. We want it to be a big flop for Slorc," she said.
     <p>
     The private organisation released last month a new brochure on human 
     rights and tourism that notes the military's extensive holdings in the 
     tourist industry such as those of the family of former dictator Gen Ne 
     Win, which has a half share in Burma's Myamar Airways.
     <p>
     The document says the Slorc has stakes in luxury hotels such as the 
     Strand, New World and Inya Lake and that senior military officers and 
     their families run other tourist enterprises. The Nawarat hotel is 
     partially owned by Sanda  Win, Ne Win's daughter. Lt Gen Khin Nyunt 
     partially owns the Mya Yeik Nyo hotel. His daughter and son-in-law own 
     the Rainbow Company which provides a range of tourism  services such 
     as drinking water tours, the group said.
      <p>
     "You would be aware of the recent allegations about Stephen Law, the 
     son of drug warlord Lo Hsein Hang, and his joint venture developments 
     with the Singaporean government whereby drug money is laundered in 
     projects like the Traders Hotel in Rangoon," Hunt said.
     <p>
     According to the Australian Financial Review  there is a chronic 
     oversupply of international-standard hotel rooms in Rangoon and there 
     are rumours that the hotel industry provides a way of laundering 
     money.
     <p>
     Despite the competition, top rates are only around $150 a night. There 
     are now 409 hotels with 9,276 rooms across the country, compared to 20 
     state-owned hotels in 1988, it said.
     <p>
     Though the generals said they want tourists to see the "Golden Land" 
     security remains a key concern  for them.
      <p>
     "Some tourists can instigate trouble and spread misinformation. 
     we have to maintain stability," said Lt Gen Kyaw Ba.
     <p>
     Since the beginning of this year several tourists have been sent back 
     to  Rangoon after being picked up while traveling through provincial 
     areas.
     <p>
     Moreover, the tourism minister refused to grant landing rights to two 
     tour groups  from the United States. The reason: the American tourists 
     planned to see opposition  leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
     In May the US government warned its citizens not to travel to Burma 
     because of political tensions and the crackdown on the opposition.
     <p>
     Suu Kyi, herself, doesn't support the tourism campaign and has urged 
     tourists to avoid Burma.
     <p>
     "For tourists, there is a time to come and a time not to come," she 
     said.
     <p>
     Some tour agencies are joining the  movement as well.
     <p>
     In May, one British travel agency, Himalayan Kingdoms said in a letter 
     to Kyaw Ba: "We feel it is morally wrong to operate in a country that 
     uses forced labour Land forcible relocation of people to develop 
     tourism."
     <p>
     On Nov 18, the same day the junta launched its tourism campaign, Paul 
     Carrick, managing director of STA travel in Australia issued a 
     statement saying "STA Travel does not support the current regime in 
     Burma. STA travel would like to join in the campaign in support of 
     change in Burma." The office has advised its branches to cease selling 
     Burma as a destination and will amend promotional material 
     accordingly. 
      <p>
     "I think the Slorc's tourism campaign will fail due to their own 
     rectitude in promotions as much as to increased awareness
     of human rights abuses underlying tourism," Hunt said.
     <p>
     In the  wake of  last week's student protests the situation remains 
     tense. Tanks, army trucks and soldiers still  patrol the city.
     <p>
     Tourists, before visiting Burma, will need to think twice.

Weighing the Ethics of a Trip</h1></td>

December 15, 1996 (New York Times)
     By Seth Mydans
     
     A vacation trip does not commonly require a moral choice, but in the 
     case of  Myanmar, the former Burma, there is no way to avoid one.
          One of Asia's loveliest and least-traveled nations, Myanmar is in the 
     grip of
     a military junta that has drawn condemnation from around the world for 
     its
     suppression of democracy and its abuses of human rights.
     <p>
     This month, the junta's problems have increased as campus 
     demonstrations
     raised the possibility of student unrest spilling onto the streets of 
     Yangon.
     On Dec. 9, the United States Department of State issued an 
     announcement
     recommending that ``U.S. citizens exercise all due caution in 
     traveling to
     Burma and should for the time being curtail travel to Burma (Myanmar) 
     absent
     a compelling reason.''
     <p>
     In a bid to build tourism and win international legitimacy, the 
     military
     government has undertaken an effort to attract visitors by 
     inaugurating Visit
     Myanmar Year in November.
     <p>
     Its opponents are urging tourists to stay away, part of a broader call 
     for an
     economic boycott. The first major effort by the country in decades to 
     open its
     doors to the outside world has become a test of the world's attitudes 
     toward it.
     <p>
     
     Almost the entire leadership of the junta, known as the State Law and 
     Order
     Restoration Council, turned out on Nov. 18 for the start of Visit 
     Myanmar Year.
     
     ``Today is a red-letter day for tourism in Myanmar,'' said Lt. Gen. 
     Khin
     Nyunt, who is in charge of both tourism development and military 
     intelligence.
     ``We are celebrating not only the launching of Visit Myanmar Year but 
     also our
     commitment to open our doors to the world.''
     
     The moment had been many months in preparation, involving a 
     considerable
     portion of the country's limited resources.
     <p>
     Scores of new hotels have been opened in the capital city of Yangon 
     and other
     tourist areas. Two new domestic airlines have started service and a 
     new
     airport arrival hall has been opened in Yangon. Tourist sites have 
     been
     refurbished and visa procedures eased.
     <p>
     But politically, little has changed, and this year has seen an 
     escalating
     crackdown on the pro-democracy forces that rally around the country's 
     most
     popular and charismatic figure, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. It is this 
     behavior that
     has raised calls for a boycott.
     <p>
     The junta came to power in 1988 following the killings of hundreds of 
     pro-democracy demonstrators, then clung to power after losing an 
     election in
     1990 to Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's party, the National League for 
     Democracy.
     She herself was held under house arrest for six years until July 1995 
     and was
     temporarily put under house arrest again last week after the student 
     demonstrations in the capital.
     <p>
     Since May of this year, the government has arrested nearly 1,000 of 
     her
     supporters  though most have since been set free  and is now 
     preventing her
     from making the weekly addresses that had been the country's one forum 
     for
     free speech.
     <p>
     Just nine days before the start of Visit Myanmar Year, bands of 
     officially
     sanctioned thugs attacked Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's car in the first act 
     of
     violence against her. One of her aides was slightly injured.
     <p>
     A year ago, Yozo Yokota, then the human rights investigator in Myanmar 
     for
     the United Nations, reported that forced labor was being used to 
     refurbish
     tourist
     sites like the temple complex at Bagan.
     
     Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi herself has asked tourists to stay away.
     
     ``We are not saying, `Don't come to Burma forever,''' she said in a 
     recent
     interview. ``What we are saying now at the moment is, `Boycott Visit 
     Myanmar
     Year.' And that's not a big thing to ask, you know.''
     <p>
     Not everyone agrees. Even some of her supporters abroad argue that 
     visitors
     will bring much-needed dollars, as well as ideas of freedom and 
     democracy, to
     the country's people.
     
     ``I don't bother about politics,'' said a Greek tourist on a recent 
     flight
     into the country. ``I have visited many countries with unpleasant 
     governments.
     And I think every dollar I spend here will help someone to make a 
     living.''
     <p>
     Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi rebuts that argument by saying that the main 
     beneficiaries will be the generals, foreign hotel owners and the 
     relatively
     well-off workers in the tourism industry. And any sacrifice of tourist 
     dollars
     that the people must make, she says, is a small price to pay to oppose 
     the
     junta.
     
     But her call for a boycott has given the government its best 
     propaganda
     argument against her. In a lust for personal power, it says in 
     newspaper
     commentaries, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi is taking food from the mouths of 
     her
     fellow citizens.
     <p>
     Even without a boycott, the success of Visit Myanmar Year is far from 
     assured.
     The country has already scaled back its 12-month target from 500,000 
     visitors
     to 250,000.
     
     And it is not even clear that it can accommodate that many. Last year 
     fewer
     than 100,000 tourists visited Myanmar, according to government 
     figures. There
     
     are fewer than 5,000 seats a week on international flights into the 
     country
     and, despite the flurry of building, fewer than 3,500 hotel rooms in 
     the
     capital.

     <br>
November 13, 1996 (Australian Financial Review)<br>
     By Jennifer Sexton.<p>
     
     Burma warns against "despicable traitors" as the SLORC regime prepares 
     to
     launch Visit Myanmar Year. Jennifer Sexton reports from Mandalay. 
     It's a glorious sunny day sailing the Irrawaddy River - and relaxing 
     until
     the subject turns to human rights and the dilemma this presents for 
     tourists
     to Burma.
     <p>
     "I think we're doing the right thing. They need us to come. They've 
     worked
     hard and they need tourists," says Mrs Coombs, a well-to-do British 
     visitor.
     "They benefit from the little things that we buy," offers an American 
     woman.

     But even on the Rolls Royce of tours in Burma - the US$25 million Road 
     to
     Mandalay cruise ship - politics has a pesky way of interfering with a 
     tourist's wish to indulge the senses.
     <p>
     As political tensions escalate between the State Law and Order 
     Restoration
     Council and the democracy movement, human rights groups worldwide are 
     promoting tourist boycotts, with a view to making Visit Myanmar Year a 
     flop,
     ahead of its launch next week. (Myanmar is the SLORC's name for 
     Burma.)
     "I think the SLORC's Visit Myanmar Year Campaign will fail due to 
     their own
     ineptitude in promotions as much as to increased awareness of human 
     rights
     abuses underlying tourism," one Australian human rights activist said. 
     Travel agents in Rangoon say cancellations have increased as SLORC's 
     crackdown worsens. Even staff at SLORC's official tourism office admit 
     numbers are disappointing, "because many countries tell people not to 
     come".
     One private travel agent says: "Anybody dealing with the 
     English-speaking
     world has seen their business hammered."
<p>     
     Eastern and Oriental Express, which owns the Road to Mandalay ship 
     says it
     is apolitical but Rangoon management admits politics has contributed 
     to thin
     bookings since the ship was launched late last year.
     
     "Orient-Express accepts that the country still has some problems as it 
     goes
     through its transition but does not believe these problems are 
     atypical of
     any developing country," its vice-president in London, Nick Varian, 
     said.
     A four-day cruise from Bagan, site of thousands of ancient pagodas, to 
     Mandalay costs around $A3,480. Most of the 40 on board this cruise of 
     the
     120-berth ship were well travelled, retired or near retired Americans 
     who
     say they wanted to see Burma for themselves.
     <p>
     Viewed from air conditioned buses and the top deck of the Road to 
     Mandalay
     during two days of river cruising, the smiling Burmese people can 
     impart a
     positive impression.
     
     But they smile out of fear, according to US Ambassador to the United 
     Nations, Ms Madeline Albright. "During a lifetime of studying 
     repressive
     regimes I had found the smiling quotient in many of them to have been 
     quite
     high. Authoritarian leaders often delude themselves that they are 
     loved, but
     the smiles they see are usually prompted not by affection, but fear," 
     she
     
     told the SLORC's intelligence chief, Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt, in 
     Rangoon last year.
     <p>
     Democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi says tourism legitimises a regime 
     which
     holds power despite the 1990 election in which her party won a 
     landslide 82
     per cent of the vote. "We think it is too early for either tourist or 
     investment or aid to come pouring into Burma," Suu Kyi said. "As long 
     a new
     money comes in, the SLORC is under less and less incentive to change." 
     But with 33 per cent of direct foreign money invested in the tourism 
     and
     hotels sector and the SLORC badly in need of an economic kick-start, 
     detractors are denounced as "despicable traitors".
     <p>
     Tourism Minister Kyaw Ba expects 230,000 visitors, including business 
     travellers, in the next 12 months, up from 170,000 tourist last fiscal 
     year
     and 90,500 in 1993-94, when independent travellers were not allowed 
     and
     visits were restricted to two weeks. In March 1994 visas for 28 days 
     independent travel were introduced. Last fiscal year 1,300 Australian 
     tourists visited.
     <p>
     There is a chronic oversupply of international-standard hotel rooms in 
     Rangoon and rumours are that the hotel industry provides a way of 
     laundering
     money. Despite the competition, top room rates are only around US$150 
     a night.
     There are now 409 hotels with 9,276 rooms across the country, compared 
     to 20
     state-owned hotels in 1988, the year the SLORC crushed a democracy 
     uprising,
     killing an estimated 10,000 people.

                           November 5, 1996, 
 <p>
     
        International labor union bodies based in Geneva and several Swiss
     non-governmental organizations Tuesday appealed to businessmen and 
     tourists for
     a travel and investment boycott of Burma.
     
        The appeal was issued two weeks before the launch by the Burmese 
     military
     government of a "Tourist Year" campaign which critics say is being 
     promoted by
     advertisements for the country as "the mysterious land of golden 
     pagodas." 
     
        It called on the Swiss people and political and economic leaders 
     "to bring
     immediate support to the embattled Burmese democracy movement by 
     refraining from
     travelling to Burma, and by refusing to cooperate in any way with the 
     military
     regime."
     <p>
        It said the Rangoon government hoped the campaign would attract 
     250,000
     travellers from around the world "whose tourist dollars will fill the 
     state
     coffers emptied by the war the junta has been waging against its own 
     people....
     
        "In order to provide the necessary tourist infrastructure, the 
     military
     government has comitted massive violations of human rights," the 
     appeal
     declared.
     
        "Hundreds of thousands of people have been forcibly relocated to 
     provide
     space for new hotel complexes and business centers in time for the 
     tourist
     year," it added.
     
        "An unknown number of people, including women, children and the 
     elderly, have
     been conscripted as forced laborers on roads, railways, airports and 
     tourist
     sites."
     <p>
        Among organizations launching or supporting the appeal were global 
     labor
     bodies representing workers in the food and catering industries, 
     transport
     workers, and commercial and clerical employees.

     November 18, 1996 (The New Light of Myanmar) <br>
     by Maung Kyaw Hoe<br>
     
     Mother's Profound and Meaningful Desire <p>
     
     Mother's desire is profound and meaningful -- "Son, when you are in 
     Yangon [Rangoon] buy me a radio without the BBC and the VOA". My mother is 
     simple, honest, and always sees and tells the truth, so she could not stand 
     deception. She hates the BBC and the VOA and does not want to hear 
     their false allegations.  She reads the daily newspapers and watches Myanmar 
     [Burmese] television everyday. She has also read the book "Allegations 
     of the BBC and the VOA" published by the Information and Public Relations 
     Department. She has visited Yangon together with me at the end of 
     October and knows that the people around the country are earning an honest 
     living. Despite all this, Mother became upset because the BBC and the VOA have 
     been biased in reporting about Daw Suu Kyi, U Kyi Maung, U Tin U, U Win 
     Tin, and the National League for Democracy [NLD]. 
     <p>
     Not only my mother but the entire populace know that the BBC and the 
     VOA's reports are far from true. After some time she became frustrated with 
     their broadcasts and simply told me: "Son, when you are in Yangon buy me a 
     radio without the BBC and the VOA". What a profound and meaningful desire. 
     Mother never joined any political party but she knows the absolute 
     situation of the country, especially the post-1988 situation. 
     <p>
     Mother knows that it is undeniable that nobody could take any 
     responsibility during the 1988 disturbances [mass pro-democracy demonstrations which 
     reached its height on 8- 8-88], which still send shivers down one's 
     spine even thinking about it today, although eight years have passed. The Defense 
     Services personnel, who were young men during the 1962 era [when 
     General Ne Win took over state power on 2-3-62], have bravely taken up their 
     national duty.  The Defense Services has effectively carried out national politics to 
     prevent the recurrence of that bitter experience. It has laid down the 
     three main national causes and has accepted them as the national duty. The 
     Defense Services is striving to uplift patriotic spirit and making it more 
     dynamic because patriotism is the basis of love and loyalty to your country. 
     The Defense Services is also making utmost efforts as a national duty to 
     develop the youth and instill patriotism. The Defense Services is striving for 
     economic development in Myanmar -- the basis for the development of 
     democracy and human rights. Although faced with difficulties, it is 
     gradually transforming the economy into
     a market-oriented economic system. 
     <p>
      Self-sufficiency was further proven with the ability to provide, 
     without depending on foreign aid and assistance, for food, clothing, and 
     shelter needs of the 44 million people based on the agriculture, forestry, 
     livestock, and fisheries sectors. Mother knows that unprecedented 
     national unity has been achieved and border area development works are in 
     progress. 
     <p>
     The country is on the verge of transformation to industrialization. 
     Endeavors have been made to safeguard the enduring cultural 
     traditions, to sustain development, and to establish a developed, stable, and modern 
     nation.  Considerable progress has been made in drafting an enduring state
     constitution by holding a national convention with participation of 
     various national people. Mother is aware of Ma Suu Kyi's [Aung San Suu Kyi] 
     National League for Democracy [NLD] delegates who sulked and left the National Convention. 
     Mother often commented that it was wrong for the NLD to leave the 
     convention. Mother's conviction is that all should participate in the 
     National Convention which is a national political undertaking. Mother 
     is quite used to the sound of the VOA and the BBC which repeatedly 
     broadcast fabrications about the NLD leaders. Mother no longer wants to hear the 
     VOA and the BBC. Mother is aware that the two will drop dead shrieking 
     like a cricket. That is why Mother said: "Son, when you are in Yangon buy me 
     a radio without the BBC and the VOA."

         November 1, 1996 (excerpts)
     <p>
     Source: TV Myanmar, Rangoon, in Burmese 1330 gmt 1 Nov 96 
     Excerpts from report of news conference held in Rangoon on 1st 
     November by
     Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw, including question and answer session in 
     English,
     as broadcast by Burmese TV
     <p>
     [Reporter Maung Maung, from Japanese Jiji Press, in English] I would 
     like to
     ask you one question, U Ohn Gyaw. The European Union governments were 
     said
     to have decided to deny visa to certain categories of Myanmar 
     [Burmese]
     nationals. What is your comment and are you bothered or disconcerted 
     by the
     decision?
     <p>
     ...whatever we were accused of, grossly violating human rights, but we 
     do
     not have such a [violation] in our country in existence in such a 
     manner. So
     whatever they do is, of course, their own [as heard]. As far as we are 
     concerned, we look forward to having more contacts and then we look 
     forward
     to having more meetings in order to get [pauses] to point that they 
     are
     convinced that we
     are not actually transgressing, we are not violating human rights 
     principles. Of course, in the bilateral relations, when there is a 
     certain
     measures taken by [pauses] be it EU or any other country, of course, 
     our
     response will be on the reciprocal basis...
     <p>
     [Reporter Hla Htwe, from the Japanese newspaper `Nihon Keizai 
     Shimbun', in
     English] I understand that ASEAN has to decide matters on consensus 
     regarding the timing of Myanmar's entry into ASEAN. Formally, we are 
     given
     to understand that the ASEAN countries are quite eager to accept 
     Myanmar
     next year. According to news reports, there had been a shift of their 
     attitude regarding that timing. Would you make some comments on that 
     matter?
     <p>
     [Ohn Gyaw, in English] I don't think there is any shift, because to be 
     integrated fully into ASEAN fold, there are certain requirements - 
     that of
     course the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, and then the zone of peace 
     and
     freedom, and of course other commitment, what the ASEAN had already 
     done. 
     It is a process. It's more of a tactical and then, mind you, it is not 
     political. The ASEAN is so strict that there is no political; but some 
     people who do not understand that, they would like to interpret from 
     the
     aspect of our political [condition]. But we are confident, and I am 
     very
     much convinced, that our integration into the ASEAN fold is a matter 
     of
     time...
     <p>
     Replying to questions raised by S. Tsukataka of [Japanese newspaper] 
     `Yomiuri Shimbun' on the action taken by the US and EU, U Ohn Gyaw 
     said he
     believed it was a one-sided approach and that they had a wrong view... 
     [AFP correspondent, in English] When will you reciprocate? When will 
     you
     reciprocate taking out visa restriction on EU in response to their 
     action
     against Burma?
     <p>
     [Ohn Gyaw, in English] It will be decided by the minister of foreign 
     affairs. When we need it we will do it. We have many friends in the 
     15-EU
     membership, but when we take action, of course, it will be the measure 
     that
     we are going to deploy. It may or may not be to all, because most of 
     the EU
     members are our friends. We understand them. But those people who are 
     belligerent, who seek to do something which is stronger and 
     unnecessary
     move, then of course we'll have to take measures. A reciprocity will 
     be
     there. 
     <p>
     Dr Than Nyunt, deputy minister of education, replied to a question 
     about
     student unrest that it was not unusual for the students to gather in 
     the
     evening at the beginning of term. University students in other 
     countries
     also gather in this manner. The incident took place while the students 
     were
     gathered to enjoy themselves on the evening of a school holiday. The 
     universities are now open and the students are attending classes 
     regularly
     and performing their duties...
     <p>
     Col Kyaw Thein said he is being asked quite often by reporters about 
     the
     dialogue with the domestic politicians. He added that most people link 
     and
     compare the government's action pertaining to the ethnic armed groups. 
     He
     noted that before entering into a dialogue with the ethnic armed 
     groups, the
     authorities first assess their response. The face-to-face dialogue 
     takes
     place only when the authorities are convinced that they can talk with 
     the
     armed groups. If their response is in accordance with the three main 
     national causes outlined by the SLORC - non-disintegration of the 
     union,
     non-disintegration of national solidarity and perpetuation of national 
     sovereignty - and lends itself to joining hands for the development of 
     their
     respective areas, then the dialogue takes place.
     Regarding the domestic politicians, Col Kyaw Thein said that some 
     politicians do as they please, and the majority of them are not 
     talking
     about the development of the country, but they are talking about 
     taking
     action against Burma through sanctions, as well as about other issues. 
     That
     is why, it is difficult for the state government to analyze these 
     issues and
     say whether it should move a step forward.

<font color="2A4572">A</font>pproximately 670,000 mentally ill people are admitted to US jails each year.<sup>1</sup> 
This is nearly eight times the number of patients admitted to state mental 
hospitals.<sup>2</sup> 
Some mentally ill offenders must be held in jail because of the 
seriousness of their offenses and should receive mental health treatment while 
incarcerated. Many others who are mentally ill, however, have committed less 
serious, nonviolent offenses such as disturbing the peace, vagrancy and 
trespassing.<sup>3</sup> There are at least three reasons why the diversion of these 
individuals into community-based mental health programs would be preferable to 
incarceration: 1) community treatment programs provide a public safety benefit 
by reducing the likelihood that the mentally ill offender will be rearrested,<sup>4</sup> 
2) community treatment programs provide a management benefit by enabling jails 
to operate more efficiently, to focus on keeping dangerous offenders off the 
streets, and to more effectively ensure the safety of jail staff and other 
detainees, 3) community treatment programs provide more effective mental health 
treatment through an array of integrated services that most jails do not offer. 
<p>  
Jails are critical places to address mental health  issues because of the sheer 
number of mentally ill persons behind bars on any given day. Jails serve as the 
first point of entry into the criminal justice system for nearly 10 million 
individuals arrested each year, as many as 13% of whom suffer from severe mental
disabilities,<sup>5</sup> compared to less than 2% in the general population.<sup>6</sup>
<p>  
This research brief focuses on the diversion of low-level, nonviolent mentally 
ill offenders to treatment programs in the community as an alternative to 
detention in dangerously overcrowded and understaffed jails. This type of 
cooperative program between the criminal justice system and the larger mental 
health care community is a proven way of effectively treating persons with 
mental illness. It also reduces the administrative burden on jails that are ill-
equipped to provide the sophisticated level of mental health services currently 
expected of them.<sup>7</sup>

Jails are becoming America's new mental hospitals. Increasing numbers of        
seriously and chronically mentally ill people are detained in US jails each     
year. As a result, jail facilities are faced with a role that they were neither 
designed nor staffed to assume. Alarmingly high numbers of severely mentally    
ill detainees are steadily causing our nation's jails to replace public mental  
hospitals as primary mental health service providers.

<b>W<font size="2">HY ARE SO MANY SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS IN JAILS?</font></b>
<ul>  
<li>Mentally ill offenders are often arrested because jails lack adequate 
procedures to divert them into community-based treatment programs, when 
appropriate. Less than 5% of jails polled nationwide in 1992 had instituted 
procedures to divert mentally ill inmates from the criminal justice system into 
the mental health treatment system.<sup>8</sup> Where treatment programs do exist in jails,
effectiveness is often undermined by inadequate staffing and weak links to the 
professional mental health community.
<li>Mentally ill offenders are often jailed because community-based treatment 
programs are either nonexistent, filled to capacity, or inconveniently located. 
Police report that they often arrest the mentally ill when treatment 
alternatives would be preferable but are unavailable.<sup>9</sup> Consequently, jails often
detain mentally ill misdemeanants for months at a time pending the availability 
of psychiatric examinations, psychiatric beds, or transportation to public 
psychiatric hospitals, which, in rural communities, can be far from jail 
facilities.<sup>10</sup> In 1992, due to the lack of psychiatric services, beds, or 
transportation to a hospital, a shocking 29% of jails surveyed reported to have 
incarcerated mentally ill persons against whom <i>no criminal charges</i> were filed.<sup>11</sup>
<li>Mentally ill offenders are often jailed for relatively minor offenses. Jail 
officials affirm that seriously mentally ill individuals are commonly jailed for
relatively minor breaches of the law, such as vagrancy, trespassing, disorderly 
conduct, alcohol-related charges, or failing to pay for a meal.
</ul>
<p>
When it is mental illness and not criminal intent that underlies a petty 
criminal act, treatment in mental health programs is demonstrably more 
effective at reducing recidivism than a sentence to jail.
<p>
<b>W<font size="2">HAT DOES CORRECTIONS THINK OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES?</font></b> 
<p>
<i>Most criminal justice administrators report that jail programs are ill-equipped 
to respond effectively to the needs of mentally ill offenders. Jail 
administrators and other corrections officials cite mental health services as 
one of the most serious institutional service needs.</i><sup>12</sup><i> Responding to a survey of
the National Institute of Justice, administrators described their mental health 
programs as "grossly understaffed" and "in urgent need" of program development 
and of intervention by mental health organizations.</i><sup>13</sup>
<ul>
<li>Sixty-four percent of jail administrators indicated the need for improved 
medical services for the mentally ill offender.<sup>14</sup>
<li>Eighty-two percent of probation and parole agency directors indicated the need
for better access to mental health professionals.<sup>15</sup>

<b>W<font size="2">HY DIVERT MENTALLY ILL OFFENDERS FROM JAIL?</font></b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Diversion of mentally ill misdemeanants into well-administered community-based
programs ensures greater public safety and protection through a combination of 
specialized mental health treatment and supervision directed toward preventing 
recidivism.<sup>16</sup>
<li>Appropriate diversion of mentally ill misdemeanants from the criminal justice 
system helps promote smooth jail operations<sup>17</sup> by reducing overcrowding and disruption in jail.
<li>Diversion of mentally ill misdemeanants into appropriate mental health 
treatment programs in the community results in a better long-term prognosis for 
individual offenders and reduces the likelihood of their return to jail for a 
similar offense.<sup>18</sup>
<li>Diversion of mentally ill misdemeanants into community-based mental health 
programs ensures specialized care by trained and professional health care staff.
</ul>
<p>
<b>D<font size="2">OES THE LACK OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES CONTRIBUTE TO THE HIGH RATE OF SUICIDE 
IN JAILS?</font></b> 
<p>  
<i>Suicide is one of the 10 leading causes of death in the US.</i><sup>19</sup><i> However, it is the
leading cause of death in jails.</i><sup>20</sup><i>  The vast majority of jail suicides occur in 
the mentally ill population. That the rate of suicide among mentally ill 
offenders in jail remains much higher than any other inmate category or in the 
general population underscores the necessity for effective and comprehensive 
intervention and prevention policies in corrections.</i>
<p>  
<b>Suicide in jails is predictable and preventable.</b>
<ul>
<li>Over 50% of suicides in jails are committed within the first 24 hours of 
incarceration; 29% are committed within the first three hours.<sup>21</sup>
<li>Over 95% of those who commit suicide in correctional facilities have a 
treatable psychiatric illness, 75% communicate their intent in advance, and 30% 
have made previous attempts.<sup>22</sup>
<li>The rate of suicide among those inmates who have made previous attempts is 
more than 100 times the rate in the general population.<sup>23</sup>
</ul>
<p>
Jail inmates who are mentally ill are at a disturbingly high risk for suicide. 
The successful prevention of suicides in jails depends largely on the ability 
and willingness of corrections staff and mental health professionals to work 
together in identifying those at risk and providing the treatment and monitoring
necessary to ensure their safety and rehabilitation.
<p>  
<b>M<font size="2">ENTAL ILLNESS IN JAIL...</font></b>
<p>
US jails are troubled by serious overcrowding. Many corrections officials agree 
that jail facilities are inadequately equipped to handle the growing inmate 
population, particularly the number of inmates with serious mental illnesses. 
<p>
Although all competent violators of the law, mentally ill or not, are legally 
responsible for the crimes they commit, it is clear that incarceration cannot be
the only solution. For those mentally ill offenders who commit serious crimes, 
especially crimes that threaten the safety of the community, jail or other forms
of incarceration may be the most appropriate choice. For the low-level offender 
who is seriously mentally ill, however, incarceration may be inappropriate and 
unnecessary.
<p>
<b>...I<font size="2">S THERE ANOTHER SOLUTION?</font></b>
<p>  
A more effective alternative is to divert misdemeanants who are mentally ill 
from jail to appropriate community-based mental health programs where they can 
receive treatment and other vital support services. Diversion to treatment 
centers outside of jail has proven to be highly effective in reducing the 
likelihood of recidivism. 
<p>
US jails are not mental health facilities. Let us re-establish our jails as 
centers of true justice and place mentally ill persons in treatment programs - 
not behind bars.

<b><u>Overview</u></b><br>
<b></b><br>
<b><center>I.  C.  THEORIES</b><br>
<b></b><br>
<br>
</center>Three theories are commonly used to discuss the root causes of
domestic violence and behaviors associated with the victim's response to such
abuse.  These models are the sociohistorical, interpersonal violence and family
violence models. <br>
<u></u><br>
<u></u>	<u>Sociohistorical theory</u>  (also referred to as the gender-politics
model) <br>
<br>
The ideology of male dominance &amp; male dominated institutions of social
control, including marriage are used toexplain why males use violence to
maintain their already greater authority and privilege in our
society(IB-2)(IB-3). <br>
<br>
The appropriate responses are considered to be: creation of emergency shelter,
criminal prosecution of the abuser, victim empowerment, and provision of a
means for survivors to escape further violence.<br>
<br>
<br>
	<u>Interpersonal violence theory</u><br>
<u></u><br>
<u></u>Abuse is caused by any of the following factors: psychological problems
such as borderline personality disorder, psychosocial problems such as
substance abuse, and distorted interpersonal communications.  These
difficulties, in conjunction with current stressors such as unemployment, may
trigger an episode of domestic violence according to the interpersonal violence
model.<br>
(IB-4)<br>
<br>
Psychotherapy has proven to be the most effective response.<br>
<br>
	<u>Family violence theory</u><br>
<u></u><br>
<u></u>According to this theory, the root cause of domestic violence is the
societal support for physical punishment in childhood and acceptance of the use
of violence to resolve marital disputes.(IB-1) <br>
<br>
Public education, police intervention, and tighter control over family behavior
are considered the appropriate responses.<br><br>
<br>
Whatever theory one subscribes to, experts are in agreement that abuse is
distinguished by its sexual nature and battering develops in stages
characterized by increasing levels fo danger, fear, isolation, and
entrapment.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
</center>Why does spouse abuse so often lead to battering?  (In other words,
why does the victim stay?(ID-1)<br>
<br>
	-- inadequate legal protections against further violence;<br>
<br>
	-- victim's fear of being killed if s/he leaves;<br>
<br>
	-- desire not to split up the family;<br>
<br>
	-- lack of enough money to move out;<br>
<br>
	-- total control batterer maintains over the victim's life;<br>
<br>
	-- inappropriate or punitive responses of institutions set up to help
victims;<br>
<br>
	-- victim's fear of church sanction.<br>

<b></b><br>
<b><center>How many women are abused or killed in the U.S. as a result of
domestic violence each year?</b><br>
<b></center></b><br>
<b><center></center>*	</b>An estimated 2-4 million women are physically abused
in the U.S. each year.  Between 21% and 60% of all women have been beaten at
least once by their male partner.(1) <b></b><br>
<b></b><br>
<b>*	</b>30-40%<b> </b>of women murdered in the U.S. are killed by men with
whom they formerly had an intimate relationship; most of these murders occur
when women are trying to end the relationship.(2)<b></b><br>
<b></b><br>
<b></b><br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Are the police arresting suspected batterers?</b><br>
<b>Are there any special courts that address domestic violence?</b><br>
<b>Are there sentencing guidelines for judges to use with perpetrators of
domestic abuse now?</b><br>
<b>What about victims who kill their batterers?</b><br>
<b>What are the recidivism rates for abusers who go to jail, prison, or enter a
treatment program?</b><br>
<b>How many women seek medical treatment for physical problems caused related
to domestic violence?</b><br>
<b>Is there a link between domestic violence and substance abuse?</b><br>

</center><br>
This book is laid out very clearly.  Particularly intriguing sections include:
Structure of Society, Aftermath of Family Violence, and Prevention and Change.
The authors discuss the two national surveys on domestic violence at length and
suggest new scoring methods. References and index are not nearly extensive
enough.<br>

<br>
Ammerman and Hersen's book is considered a classic among the clinical texts on
family violence.  It is, therefore, cited in numerous other publications making
it an important work.  The sourcebook provides a thorough exploration of the
most important clinical, legal, sociological, and psychological issues.  case
studies, tabular data, extensive references, and both a subject and author
index help to enhance the material presented.<br>

OJP Bureaus' Fiscal Year 1995 Program Plans<br>
<br>
    The  increasing  crime  rate,  particularly escalating violent crime by<br>
juvenile offenders, continues to be a major concern of the American public.<br>
No  community  is  untouched. Law enforcement and criminal justice agencies<br>
around  the  country  are  faced with new and increasing challenges as they<br>
respond to crime.<br>
<br>
    The  Fiscal Year 1995 Program Plans for the United States Department of<br>
Justice, Office of Justice Programs (OJP) Bureaus-the National Institute of<br>
Justice,  the  Bureau of Justice Assistance, the Office of Juvenile Justice<br>
and  Delinquency Prevention, and the Office for Victims of Crime-reflect an<br>
effort   to   address   these  problems  aggressively.  Their  simultaneous<br>
publication  in  the Federal Register reflects an emphasis on collaborative<br>
relationships  among  the  Bureaus  and  a  strong commitment to working in<br>
partnership  with  communities across the country in addressing the problem<br>
of crime.<br>
<br>
    These plans not only reflect a renewed commitment to coordination among<br>
the  OJP  Bureaus,  but also demonstrate a recognition that the only way in<br>
which  we  can hope to have an impact on the country's crime problems is by<br>
reaching  out  to public agencies at all levels of government, as well as a<br>
broad  range  of  community and private groups. In developing their Program<br>
Plans,  the  Bureaus  solicited input from State and local criminal justice<br>
agencies,  constituent  and community groups, law enforcement, prosecutors,<br>
courts,  corrections  agencies,  and  victim  service providers, as well as<br>
other Department of Justice components and other Federal agencies. Thus, in<br>
addition  to  embracing  existing  Administration and Department of Justice<br>
initiatives-reducing     violent     crime,     developing    comprehensive<br>
community-based  approaches  to crime and violence, focusing on youth crime<br>
and  firearms,  actively  involving  citizens  in  prevention  efforts, and<br>
meeting  the  needs of crime victims-the Fiscal Year 1995 OJP Program Plans<br>
also reflect needs expressed by the field.<br>
<br>
    The  Program Plans encourage applicants to forge partnerships along new<br>
frontiers,  often  reaching  beyond  criminal  justice  boundaries  to find<br>
solutions.   By   approaching   crime   and  violence  in  a  comprehensive<br>
fashion-bringing  all  the  players  in  the system together-applicants are<br>
encouraged  to improve the effectiveness of their services, reduce wasteful<br>
duplication, and identify new and innovative approaches to tough problems.<br>
<br>
    For  example,  OJP Bureaus are working together on several initiatives,<br>
such   as  Project  PACT  (Pulling  America's  Communities  Together),  the<br>
Comprehensive  Communities Program (CCP), and the new Safe Futures Program,<br>
that  fund communities to mobilize their law enforcement and justice system<br>
resources  together  with  a  coalition  of government agencies and private<br>
sector  resources. Working in partnership with the community, key officials<br>
and community leaders develop broad-based, coordinated strategies to reduce<br>
the  high  rates  of  drug  abuse  and  related crime and violence in their<br>
neighborhoods. Project PACT, CCP, and Safe Futures are examples of programs<br>
that  empower  communities to impact crime and violence, particularly youth<br>
violence,  through  comprehensive  planning, and improved intergovernmental<br>
relationships.<br>
<br>
    Another  recurrent  theme  in  the  OJP  Program  Plans  is the Federal<br>
government's  role  in  providing leadership and guidance on crime control,<br>
prevention  and victims issues by developing and testing new approaches and<br>
determining  "what  works."  As  model  programs  are  tested and developed<br>
through  research,  evaluation,  and  demonstration  grants, information on<br>
effective  programs and practices is disseminated widely to State and local<br>
criminal  justice and social service agencies. Local communities should not<br>
have  to  "road test" new ideas without solid knowledge about what has been<br>
tried before in other jurisdictions, what has worked, and what has not. The<br>
Program  Plans also provide information on the availability of training and<br>
technical assistance to assist States and local jurisdictions interested in<br>
implementing "best practices."<br>
<br>
    Important  priorities  identified  in  the 1994 Crime Act- particularly<br>
with  regard  to  violence against women, the illegal possession and use of<br>
firearms,  and  comprehensive, innovative prevention and early intervention<br>
strategies  aimed  at  high  risk  youth-are  also reflected in the Program<br>
Plans.<br>
<br>
    Another  key  goal  for  OJP was to make it easier for States and local<br>
communities to access OJP services, programs, and information. As a result,<br>
we  have set up a new inter-department, Internet-based clearinghouse called<br>
PAVNET.  PAVNET  will  provide information on promising programs, available<br>
funding,  and  technical  assistance. We have also set up the Department of<br>
Justice Response Center to answer questions concerning program availability<br>
and funding.<br>
<br>
    The Program Plans that follow, describe in greater detail OJP's funding<br>
goals  and  priorities for this Fiscal Year. For more information about the<br>
application  process, as well as about Crime Act programs, you can call the<br>
DOJ Response Center at 1-800-421-6770.<br>

<br>
As  we move ahead with our initiatives for Fiscal Year 1995, the Office<br>
of  Justice  Programs  is  committed  to  working in close partnership with<br>
communities  at  the State and local level. Only by working together can we<br>
hope  to  have  an  impact  on  the enormous problems of crime and violence<br>
confronting our nation today.<br>

Bureau of Justice Assistance<br>
<br>
Fiscal Year 1995 Program Plan<br>
<br>
    I  am  pleased  to  announce  the  Bureau of Justice Assistance's (BJA)<br>
Discretionary  Program  Plan  for  FY  1995.  BJA  assists States and local<br>
jurisdictions  through  the  Edward  Byrne  Memorial  State  and  Local Law<br>
Enforcement  Assistance  Program.  Through  the  Byrne  Discretionary Grant<br>
Program,  BJA  provides  leadership  and  guidance  on  crime  and violence<br>
prevention and control and criminal justice system improvement at the State<br>
and  local  levels.  BJA also develops and tests new approaches in criminal<br>
justice and crime control, and encourages replication of effective programs<br>
and practices by State and local agencies. {pg 21853}<br>
<br>
    This year, BJA's plan focuses primarily on national scope demonstration<br>
programs.  These  programs  support  two  goals: to assist States and local<br>
units  of  government to reduce and prevent crime, violence, and drug abuse<br>
and  to  improve  the criminal justice system. To meet these goals BJA will<br>
work  with  communities  to develop comprehensive strategies and expansive,<br>
problem-solving  partnerships.  Special emphasis is placed on anti-violence<br>
initiatives,  particularly  those dedicated to reducing the availability of<br>
illegal firearms and providing young people with  alternatives to gangs and<br>
criminal   involvement.   Additionally,   BJA  will  continue  to  work  in<br>
partnership  with  State  and  local law enforcement, as well as the United<br>
States  Attorneys;  improve  the  adjudication  process; assist States with<br>
alleviating  prison overcrowding by fostering corrections options programs;<br>
and   focus   resources  on  both  evaluation  of  promising  programs  and<br>
dissemination of information about these programs to the field.<br>
<br>
    BJA's Program Plan for FY 1995 includes a $50 million appropriation for<br>
general  programs  and  a $12 million appropriation for Corrections Options<br>
Programs.  It  describes  planned  activities  for the Regional Information<br>
Sharing  Program  (RISS)  and the National White Collar Crime Center. Joint<br>
efforts planned with other Federal agencies are also described.<br>
<br>
    Obviously,    our    dollars   are   limited.   Consistent   with   the<br>
Administration's  policies and in an effort to get the most for each dollar<br>
spent,  I  am  committed  to  making  BJA's  Discretionary Grant Program as<br>
competitive  as  possible  and  to  maximizing  the impact of these limited<br>
competitive  dollars through a wide array of programs directed toward urban<br>
communities, rural areas, and Native American communities. For this reason,<br>
in FY 1995 BJA will:<br>
<br>
    .Give  preference  to  applicants  who  leverage  BJA  dollars  through<br>
partnerships  among  organizations bringing a commitment of other resources<br>
to the table (such as Empowerment Zones/Enterprise Communities);<br>
<br>
    .Notify  all  grantees that continuation funding in future years is not<br>
guaranteed  but,  rather,  will  be based on performance and other relevant<br>
factors;<br>
<br>
    .Institute  the  practice  of awarding a declining BJA share of funding<br>
for second and subsequent years where continuation funding is provided;<br>
    .Complete  the process of developing, in consultation with the National<br>
Institute of Justice, a strategy for obtaining early evaluative information<br>
on   particularly   promising  programs  for  early  dissemination  to  our<br>
constituents;<br>
<br>
    .Promote  activities  complementing  the  initiatives being implemented<br>
through the Crime Act; and<br>
<br>
    .Continue  to maximize OJP resources by working in partnership with the<br>
National  Institute of Justice, the Office for Victims of Crime, the Office<br>
of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, and other components of the<br>
Justice Department.<br>
<br>
    These  initiatives,  coupled  with  focused  goals and objectives, will<br>
build stronger partnerships at all levels. I envision these partnerships to<br>
be a continuum of relationships encompassing all components of the criminal<br>
justice system.<br>
<br>
Goals<br>
<br>
    The  FY  1995 Program Plan addresses BJA's two goals: To help State and<br>
local units of government (1) reduce and prevent crime and violence and (2)<br>
improve   the   functioning   of  the  criminal  justice  system.  Enhanced<br>
coordination and cooperation of Federal, State and local efforts facilitate<br>
the  achievement  of  these goals. The objectives for each of the goals are<br>
outlined  below.  The  programs  developed  to  address  the objectives are<br>
described in the plan.<br>
<br>
.Reduce and Prevent Crime and Violence<br>
Encourage   the   development   and   implementation  of  comprehensive<br>
strategies,  in  coordination  with  human service providers, to reduce and<br>
prevent crime and violence.<br>
<br>
    Encourage  the  active  participation  of  community  organizations and<br>

How Priorities Were Established<br>
<br>
    Priorities  for  the  FY  1995  Discretionary  Grant  Program reflect a<br>
balance  of  congressional  mandates,  Administration priorities, and needs<br>
expressed  by State and local criminal justice practitioners. The goals are<br>
defined  by the authorizing legislation for the Edward Byrne Memorial State<br>
and  Local  Law  Enforcement Assistance Program. Priorities for a number of<br>
specific  programs  to address those goals are mandated by Congress through<br>
the earmarking of the appropriation.<br>
<br>
BJA's  priorities also reflect Administration and Department of Justice<br>
priorities, especially those related to reducing violent crime, the need to<br>
develop comprehensive approaches to crime and violence, the focus on youth,<br>
and the need for active citizen participation in prevention efforts.<br>
<br>
    During  the  planning  process,  BJA solicited input on priorities from<br>
national   organizations  which  represent  State  and  local  governments,<br>
criminal  justice  agencies, and community groups. Input was also requested<br>
from the State agencies which administer the Byrne Formula Grant Program as<br>
well  as  from  U.S.  Attorneys.  A number of programs that address current<br>
issues were incorporated into the plan in response to this valuable input.<br>
Types of Programs<br>
<br>
    BJA  is  authorized  by  Congress  to make awards to public and private<br>
agencies  and  organizations  for national scope and multi- State programs,<br>
demonstration programs, training, and technical assistance to assist States<br>
and  local  jurisdictions.  National  scope  programs  provide a service or<br>
product  of  benefit  throughout  the  country or across multiple States or<br>
address  issues  that are of concern nationally. Demonstration programs are<br>
used  to  develop, test, evaluate, and document new programs and practices.<br>
Training  is  developed  and  provided  to State and local criminal justice<br>
practitioners  and others to provide them with state-of-the-art information<br>
on  effective  programs  and  practices. Technical assistance is {pg 21854}<br>
provided  to  sites participating in demonstration programs or is available<br>
to  help  an  individual  jurisdiction  implement  a program or practice or<br>
address a specific issue.<br>
<br>
Competitive and Noncompetitive Grants<br>
<br>
    Each section of this Program Plan is divided into programs that will be<br>
awarded  on a competitive basis and those that are noncompetitive. Whenever<br>
possible,  BJA  encourages  broad  participation  in  the grants process by<br>
public and private agencies and organizations at the State and local levels<br>
and makes awards on a competitive basis.<br>
<br>
    Each  year, BJA also makes noncompetitive awards. There are a number of<br>
factors that limit the number of competitive programs:<br>
<br>
    .Congressional  Earmarks-Each  year  Congress  directs  BJA  to award a<br>
portion   of   the   appropriated   funds  for  specified  programs  and/or<br>
organizations. In FY 1995, over $23 million of the $50 million appropriated<br>
for  general  discretionary  programs were earmarked for specific programs.<br>
BJA was also directed to review other programs (soft earmarks) for possible<br>
funding.<br>
<br>
    .Continuation  and Implementation Grants-Many of BJA's programs require<br>
several  years  of funding to accomplish their goals. For example, training<br>
efforts  require  several years of funding to develop the curriculum and to<br>
reach  the  intended  audience.  Demonstration  sites,  which are generally<br>
selected  competitively  the  first  year,  require 2-3 years of funding to<br>
develop  fully,  implement,  and evaluate the program. In addition, BJA has<br>
funded  several  planning  efforts  with implementation funding provided in<br>
subsequent years.<br>
<br>
    .Limited  Competition-Limited competition is used when a limited number<br>
of  jurisdictions  or  organizations  meet the requirements of the program.<br>
These  jurisdictions  or  organizations  are then invited to compete for an<br>
award. A limited competition saves jurisdictions or organizations that will<br>
not  qualify  the  time  and  expense  of preparing an application. It also<br>
allows BJA to concentrate technical assistance and training on this limited<br>
pool of applicants.<br>
<br>
    .Sole Source Selection-In some cases, there is only one organization or<br>
agency  that has the capability, expertise, or constituents to administer a<br>
program  that  BJA  wants  to  implement.  For example, an association that<br>
represents   a  constituency  which  BJA  wants  to  reach  with  technical<br>
assistance  or  training  may  be  the  best  organization to implement the<br>
program.  In  other cases, BJA may make an award on a non-competitive basis<br>
to an agency that has developed an innovative program and has the expertise<br>
to implement it.<br>
<br>
    In FY 1995, BJA has modified applicant requirements and review criteria<br>
to  facilitate  stronger partnerships with grantee agencies and to maximize<br>
the impact of limited competitive dollars. These include:<br>
<br>
    .Preference  will  be  given  to  applicants  who  leverage BJA dollars<br>
through  partnerships  among  organizations  bringing a commitment of other<br>
resources to the table;<br>
<br>
    .All  grantees  are on notice that continuation funding in future years<br>
is  not  guaranteed  but,  rather,  will  be based on performance and other<br>
relevant factors; and<br>
<br>
    .As  appropriate,  BJA  will provide a declining share of total funding<br>
for  second  and  subsequent  years  where continuation funding is provided<br>
after FY 1995.<br>
<br>
Application Process<br>
<br>
    A  Program Announcement and Application Kit, which will be available in<br>
late April, will serve as a request for proposals. It will contain detailed<br>
descriptions  of  competitive  programs and complete forms and instructions<br>
for developing an application.<br>
<br>
    Competitive  Programs-The Program Announcement and Application Kit will<br>
describe  for  each  competitive  program:  the  purpose  of  the  program,<br>
background,  goals,  objectives,  program design, eligibility requirements,<br>
selection  criteria,  award period, award amount and due date. Applications<br>
for  competitive programs are due by June 30, 1995. A panel of experts will<br>
be  established  for  each  competitive program area to review and rank the<br>
applications. Funding decisions are made by the Director of BJA.<br>
<br>
    Non-Competitive   Programs-BJA   staff   will  contact  applicants  for<br>
noncompetitive programs to discuss application requirements and due dates.<br>
<br>
    The  Department  of  Justice  Response  Center  staff  are available to<br>
respond  to  questions  and  provide technical assistance to applicants and<br>
other interested parties. The Response Center number is (800) 421-6770.<br>
<br>
Goal I: Reduce and Prevent Crime and Violence<br>
<br>
Comprehensive Communities Program<br>
<br>
Encourage the Development and Implementation of Comprehensive Strategies To<br>
Reduce and Prevent Crime and Violence<br>
<br>
    The    Comprehensive    Communities    Program   (CCP)   reflects   the<br>
Administration's  priority  of  reducing  crime  and violence by initiating<br>
comprehensive  planning  and  improving intergovernmental relationships. It<br>
requires  selected  jurisdictions to engage in a comprehensive planning and<br>
strategy development process for crime and violence control and prevention.<br>
It  requires  law  enforcement  and  other governmental agencies to work in<br>
partnership  with  communities  to  address  crime problems, as well as the<br>
factors  that  increase  the  risk that individuals will become involved in<br>
problem behavior.<br>
<br>
    In  FY  1994,  16  jurisdictions  faced  with  high  rates of crime and<br>
violence  were  selected  to participate in CCP. The four Pulling America's<br>
Communities Together (Project PACT) sites were included in this group. Each<br>
jurisdiction  was  provided  with planning funds to develop a strategy that<br>
demonstrates   a   jurisdictionwide   commitment   to  community  policing,<br>
coordination among public and private agencies (including, social services,<br>
public  health,  etc.),  and  an  active  role  by the community in problem<br>
solving.<br>
<br>
    BJA made funding available for a number of program components to assist<br>
with  implementation  of  the  strategy.  These  components are designed to<br>
implement  specific  models  that BJA has already developed and found to be<br>
effective  or  models the agency wants to test. These components also allow<br>
for  the development of new models, which, if successful, can be replicated<br>
by  other  jurisdictions.  The program components are described below. Each<br>
strategy   was   required  to  include  community  policing  and  community<br>
mobilization/prevention  initiatives. Six sites received awards from the FY<br>
1994 allocation. The remaining 10 sites received awards in FY 1995.<br>
<br>
<br>
    To  address  the  rights  and  needs of the victims of crime, which are<br>
important  components  of  all of the community-based programs, BJA and the<br>
Office  for  Victims  of  Crime  will  jointly fund a number of programs to<br>
assist  the  victims of crime and to increase the criminal justice system's<br>
responsiveness to the rights and needs of victims.<br>
<br>
Competitive<br>
<br>
<br>
Victim Services as a Component of the Criminal Justice System $450,000<br>
<br>
    This project will provide training and technical assistance to criminal<br>
justice  agencies  to encourage them to be more responsive to the needs and<br>
concerns  of  victims  and  to  incorporate  victim  services into criminal<br>
justice functions.<br>
<br>
<br>
Violence Reduction<br>
<br>
Reduce  the Availability of Illegal Weapons and Develop Programs to Address<br>
Violence in Our Communities, Homes, Schools, and Workplaces<br>
<br>
    Efforts  to  reduce and prevent violence continue to be high priorities<br>
in  FY  1995.  BJA's efforts will include the continuation and expansion of<br>
programs to reduce the availability of illegal firearms, prevent homicides,<br>
and reduce violence in our communities.<br>
<br>
    In  FY 1993 and 1994, BJA began to address the increase in gun violence<br>
and  homicides  through  the  initiation  of a Firearms Licensee Compliance<br>
Program,  the establishment of a Firearms Investigative Task Force Program,<br>
the  creation  of  a  Homicide  Task  Force,  and  other initiatives. These<br>
programs  will  be  expanded  and  built upon in coordination with the U.S.<br>
Attorneys' Anti-Violence and Youth Handguns Initiatives to assist State and<br>
local  criminal justice agencies and communities control and prevent street<br>
violence.<br>
<br>
    BJA   will  also  continue  its  focus  on  *domestic*  and  relational<br>
*violence* . According to the Surgeon General, the number one public health<br>
risk  to  adult  women in the United States is violence. For women ages 15-<br>
44, violence is the leading cause of injuries. The nature and prevalence of<br>
this problem has been dramatized by recent news events. BJA developed a new<br>
initiative  in  FY 1993 to address violence against women, including spouse<br>
abuse,  child  abuse,  elder  abuse,  sexual  assault,  and  stalking. This<br>
initiative   promotes   a   systems   approach  which  emphasizes  criminal<br>
prosecution  with  comprehensive  case  follow-through.  This demonstration<br>
program  will  be evaluated and documented this year to provide guidance to<br>
the States as they implement the Violence Against Women Block Grant Program<br>
created by the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.<br>
<br>
    New  initiatives  will be implemented to address the growing problem of<br>
violence in the workplace and to create a National Major Gang Task Force to<br>
track  and  respond  to  the  growing interaction between street and prison<br>
gangs.  BJA  will  also participate in a public/private partnership against<br>
violence  in  America  which  is a joint effort among private and corporate<br>
foundations  and several Federal agencies to help local communities address<br>
violence.<br>
<br>
Competitive<br>

<br>
Violence Against Women Program-Training and Technical Assistance-$150,000<br>
<br>
    A   consortium,  established  between  BJA,  the  American  Prosecutors<br>
Research  Institute,  and the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court<br>
Judges,  will  assist the demonstration sites described above in addressing<br>
the critical issues related to violence against women.<br>

1. Mahon, N. (1996). New York Inmates' HIV Risk Behaviors:  The
Implications for Prevention Policy and Programs.<u>American Journal of
Public Health, 86,</u>1211-1215.<p>
<u>Abstract:</u><p>
<i>Objectives:</i>  The median incidence rate of acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS) among prisoners is 7 times higher than for the general
population.  Yet high-risk sexual activity and drug use in US correctional
facilities remain unexamined.  This study explores inmate perceptions of
high-risk behavior in New York state prisons and New York City jails and seeks
to generate hypotheses to inform policies and future research.<p>
<i>Methods:</i>Participants were 22 former New York state prisoners and 28
current New York City inmates. Participants attended one of six focus groups
and completed an anonymous questionnaire.  Audiotapes of the groups were
transcribed and evaluated.<p>
<i>Results:</i>	A range of consensual and nonconsensual sexual activity occurs
among inmates and between inmates and staff.  Without official access to latex
barriers, prisoners use ineffective makeshift devices, like rubber gloves and
used plastic wrap, in attempts to practice safer sex.  Prisoners also shoot
drugs intravenously with used syringes and pieces of pens and light bulbs.<p>
<i>Conclusion.</i> The absence of harm-reduction devices behind bars may create
a greater risk of HIV transmission there than in the community.  Officials
should consider distribution risk-reduction devices to prisoners through
anonymous methods.<p>

<P><B>QUESTION DISCUSSED BY AMICUS</b>
Whether the invalidation by the courts below of state laws 
prohibiting physician-assisted suicide should be overruled on 
the ground that the issue is not yet ripe for constitutional 
adjudication. </p>



<p><b>INTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE</b>
The Project on Death in America was established in 1994 
by the Open Society Institute, a private non-profit operating 
foundation.  Its mission is to understand and transform the 
culture and experience of dying in the United States through 
initiatives in research, scholarship, the humanities and the arts, 
and to foster innovations in the provision of care, public 
education, professional education, and public policy.  This 
mission arose from a recognition, first, that the experience of 
dying has changed over the past several decades, with many 
more people enduring prolonged dying as a consequence of 
chronic and progressive disease and, second, that needless 
suffering -- physical, emotional, existential and spiritual -- too 
often accompanies these deaths, for both dying persons and 
survivors.</p>
<p>The Project takes no position on the question whether legal 
institutions should ultimately recognize a right to physician-
assisted suicide, whether by legislative action or by judicial 
constitutional interpretation.  Among individuals who are 
supported by, affiliated with, or responsible for the direction of 
the Project, there is no uniform view about whether physician-
assisted suicide should be endorsed by legislative action or 
constitutional adjudication.</p>
<p>Among the enterprises supported by the Project, many are 
dedicated to implementing palliative care programs in hospital 
and community settings to alleviate the needless suffering that 
currently afflicts dying people and their families.  Other 
supported programs are engaged in designing ways to enhance 
the autonomous choice of dying people in such matters as 
what treatments are provided to them, whether they die in 
institutional or home settings, and whether adequate financial 
and other community resources are available to support the 
choices preferred by dying people and their families.  By these 
means, as well as by supporting evaluative research and 
programs for public and professional education, the Project is 
addressing many of the justifiable fears that are the current 
predicates for the support of physician-assisted suicide, and is 
working to establish an adequate practical basis for evaluating 
effective safeguards for any future implementation of the 
practice of physician-assisted suicide.</p>
<p>Our goal is to promote a fully informed and equitable 
societal resolution of the question whether physician-assisted 
suicide should be legitimated, if at all, by legislation or as a 
constitutional right.</p>
<p><b>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</b><br>
Legally recognized physician-assisted suicide is not 
currently in practice in any jurisdiction in the United States.  It 
has not yet been implemented even in the one state (Oregon) 
where physician-assisted suicide was legalized by a popular 
referendum just two years ago.  If this Court were to affirm the 
judgments below declaring a constitutional right to physician-
assisted suicide, an abrupt, radical and utterly unprepared 
transformation of medical practice would be imposed on the 
entire country.</p>
<p>In Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dep't of Health, 497 U.S. 
261 (1990), which considered a constitutional claim to refuse 
life-prolonging medical treatment for a mentally incompetent 
person, this Court proceeded with considerable caution and 
refused to enunciate a uniform constitutional rule, deferring 
instead to the "divers[e] . . . number of sources" available to 
states in considering such a "perplexing question with 
unusually strong moral and ethical overtones."  Id. at 277.  
This Court thus followed Justice Brandeis' classic injunction to 
avoid premature constitutional decisions that close off state 
"experimentation" regarding "changing social . . . needs."  
New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U.S. 262, 310 (1932) 
(dissenting opinion).  </P>
<P>Following this judicious course does not necessarily 
foreclose some future constitutional determination regarding 
an individual right to physician-assisted suicide by this Court.  
In many other contexts -- such as constitutional interpretations 
of due process rights in criminal trials, and rights against cruel 
and unusual punishment -- this Court has purposefully and 
explicitly stayed its hand so that states might explore different 
solutions to novel, complex social problems.  In these 
contexts, the Court has made clear that extensive prior 
deliberation and experimentation in Brandeis' "laboratory" of 
the states is a necessary prerequisite for an adequately 
informed, ultimate judicial decision to enunciate a uniform, 
binding constitutional resolution. </P>
<P>This necessary prerequisite of extensive state deliberation 
and experimentation has hardly even begun regarding legally 
recognized physician-assisted suicide.  In particular, there are 
serious unanswered questions about the capacity of physicians 
or state officials to ensure that a gravely ill individual's choice 
for physician assistance in suicide is adequately voluntary, or 
that the individual is mentally competent or is appropriately 
diagnosed as terminally ill.  In the instant cases, however, the 
Courts of Appeals held that any constitutional right to 
physician-assisted suicide must be limited to voluntary, 
mentally competent, terminally ill individuals.  The courts 
below ignored the multiple uncertainties currently involved in 
applying these criteria in individual cases.  Because it is not 
yet certain that adequate criteria can be developed or applied, 
it is premature for any court to determine whether there is a 
federal constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide.  The 
question is not ripe for constitutional adjudication and will not 
become ripe for an indeterminate time while various states, 
free from  judicially-imposed constitutional compulsion,  
consider whether or on what terms physician-assisted suicide 
should be authorized.  The judgments below should 
accordingly be reversed.</p>
<P><B>ARGUMENT</b><br>
<p>I.	COURTS SHOULD NOT PRE-EMPT PUBLIC 
DEBATE AND LEGISLATIVE ACTION BY 
PREMATURE CONSTITUTIONAL 
RESOLUTION OF ISSUES WITH SUCH 
COMPLEX DIMENSIONS AS PHYSICIAN-
ASSISTED SUICIDE.	</p>
<p>A.	Justice Brandeis' Approach:  For "Novel Social 
Experiments," Courts Should Withhold 
Constitutional Resolution While Individual 
States, Serving As "Laboratories," Develop 
Adequate Practical and Research Experience.	
The instant case is strikingly similar to New State Ice Co. 
v. Liebmann, 285 U.S. 262 (1932).  In the heyday of its 
invocations of substantive due process to overturn state social 
and economic regulations, the Court held that a state law 
requiring a license to manufacture, sell or distribute ice was 
unconstitutional on the ground that this activity was 
"essentially private in nature" and that "under [the fourteenth] 
amendment, nothing is more clearly settled than that it is 
beyond the power of a state, 'under the guise of protecting the 
public, arbitrarily [to] interfere with private business . . . '."  Id. 
at 277-78.  Justice Brandeis dissented from this sweeping 
application of the "privacy" norm, in an opinion which the 
modern Court has acknowledged as "classic."  Whalen v. Roe, 
429 U.S. 589, 597 n. 20 (1977).</p>
<P>Justice Brandeis' reasoning applies with equal force to the 
invocations of constitutional norms of "privacy" or 
"arbitrariness" to overturn state laws against physician-assisted 
suicide, as in the Ninth and Second Circuit rulings in the 
instant case.  Justice Brandeis' dissent makes this application 
clear:</P>
<P>To stay experimentation in things social and economic is a 
grave responsibility.  Denial of the right to experiment 
may be fraught with serious consequences to the nation.  It 
is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a 
single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as 
a laboratory; and try novel social and economic 
experiments without risk to the rest of the country.  This 
Court has the power to prevent an experiment.  We may 
strike down the statute which embodies it on the ground 
that, in our opinion, the measure is arbitrary, capricious, or 
unreasonable. . . .  But, in the exercise of this high power, 
we must be ever on our guard, lest we erect our prejudices 
into legal principles.  If we would guide by the light of 
reason, we must let our minds be bold.</P>
<P>285 U.S. at 311.<br>
In New State Ice Co. the Court prevented experimentation 
on a complex question of social and economic policy by 
striking down the novel state law.  But that is not the only way 
that constitutional adjudication can override what Justice 
Brandeis referred to as the "value of the process of trial and 
error" in social experimentation.  Id. at 310.  A court can also 
prevent experimentation by prematurely imposing a 
constitutional resolution for the entire country regarding a 
novel and difficult issue at a time when individual states are 
engaged in testing the unknown or inadequately understood 
dimensions of this issue.  </P>
<P>Assessing the merits and demerits of physician-assisted 
suicide is, in Justice Brandeis' words, "a formidable task" 
involving a "multitude of judgments."  Id.  (For a specification 
of many of the empirical uncertainties regarding this practice, 
see Part II, infra).  Thus far only one state has directly 
embarked on this task by resolving to effectuate the practice; 
implementation of this experiment by the state of Oregon has 
been blocked by a federal district court's constitutional ruling.  
Lee v. Oregon, 891 F. Supp. 1429 (D. Or. 1995) (this ruling 
was explicitly disapproved in the Ninth Circuit opinion under 
review here, 79 F.3d at 839 & nn. 138-39).  But this 
impediment should be removed and we would then have the 
benefit of what Justice Brandeis called "one of the happy 
incidents of the federal system that a single courageous state 
may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel 
social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the 
country."  New State Ice Co., 285 U.S. at 311.</p>
<P>B.	Regarding Physician-Patient Relations, the 
Modern Court Has Applied Justice Brandeis' 
Approach to Avoid Premature Constitutional 
Resolution of Novel, Factually Complex Issues.
The decision of this Court most directly relevant to the 
instant case is Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dep't of Health, 
497 U.S. 261 (1990).  Cruzan was "the first case in which we 
have been squarely presented with the issue whether the 
United States Constitution grants what is in common parlance 
referred to as a 'right to die.' "  Id. at 277.  In Cruzan, the Court 
effectively endorsed Justice Brandeis' admonition to withhold 
constitutional resolution in order to promote the development 
of diverse state approaches.  The Court favorably 
acknowledged the "diversity" of state common-law 
approaches to the "perplexing question with unusually strong 
moral and ethical overtones" of withholding life-prolonging 
medical treatment from incompetent patients.  Id.  The Court 
observed that a constitutional resolution of this question would 
wrongfully truncate the range of relevant considerations 
because of the "simpl[e] and stark" way that the issue would 
be posed in constitutional adjudication, whereas individual 
states have a "number of sources" available to them "which are 
not available to us" in federal constitutional adjudication.  Id.
Cruzan explicitly acknowledged that the state regulation in 
that case directly impinged on the exercise of a 
constitutionally protected "liberty interest."  Id. at 278.  The 
Court nevertheless recognized the propriety of diverse state 
approaches to the issue in light of its complex factual context. 
Justice O'Connor made clear in her concurring opinion in 
Cruzan that the Court's deference to diverse state approaches 
did not mean that no authoritative constitutional resolution 
would ever be judicially imposed,  but only that such a 
resolution would be premature in light of the novelty and 
factual complexity of the issue.   </P>
<p>C.	The Modern Court Has Applied Justice 
Brandeis' Approach to Promote State 
Experimentation and Avoid Premature 
Constitutional Resolution in Many Other 
Contexts.</p>	
<P>In a series of decisions addressing different constitutional 
provisions, the Court has purposefully withheld constitutional 
resolution in order both to permit and to promote 
experimentation by states.  The underlying premise of these 
decisions has been that the experience and knowledge gained 
in these diverse state efforts would serve to clarify and refine 
the constitutional issues before any final judgment by this 
Court.</p>
<P>1.	Interpreting the Fourteenth Amendment 
due process right to a fair trial.	<BR>
Chandler v. Florida, 449 U.S. 560 (1981), was a 
constitutional challenge to the state's newly-instituted practice 
of broadcasting the proceedings of a criminal trial 
notwithstanding a defendant's objection.  The Court ruled that 
on the facts of the specific case before it, no constitutional 
violation had been demonstrated.  Id. at 574.  The Court 
refused, however, to enunciate a general constitutional rule 
binding for future cases.  "It is clear that the general issue of 
the psychological impact of broadcast coverage upon the 
participants in a trial, and particularly upon the defendant, is 
still a subject of sharp debate.  . . . Comprehensive empirical 
data are still not available -- at least on some aspects of the 
problem."  Id. at 577.  The Court acknowledged that the state's 
action might "have an adverse effect" on the "detached 
atmosphere" necessary to protect a defendant's right to a fair 
trial.  Id. at 578.  Nonetheless, the Court found that "at present 
no one has been able to present empirical data sufficient to 
establish" this proposition, that "further developments and 
more data are required before this [constitutional] issue can be 
finally resolved."  Id. at 578-80 & n. 12.</p>
<P>Notwithstanding the possibility that the continuation of the 
state policy would infringe on the fair trial right, the Court in 
Chandler clearly ruled that it was premature to resolve the 
constitutional issues until more experience had accumulated 
and more empirical data was available for adequate evaluation 
of the claims presented.  The Court observed, "[T]he very 
broadcast of some trials potentially [may be] a form of 
punishment in itself -- a punishment before guilt.  This 
concern is far from trivial.  But, whether coverage of a few 
trials will, in practice, be the equivalent of . . . the public 
pillory long abandoned as a barbaric perversion of decent 
justice . . . must also await the continuing experimentation."  
Id. at 580-81.  Citing "the admonition of Justice Brandeis, 
dissenting in New State Ice Co.," the Court concluded, "This 
concept of federalism . . . favoring Florida's experiment, must 
guide our decision."  Id. at 580.</p>
<P>2.	Interpreting the Eighth Amendment right 
against cruel and unusual punishments.   </P>

<P>In several instances the Court has held that it would be 
premature to impose a uniform constitutional rule in the 
administration of capital punishment until more state 
legislatures had acted, more experience had accumulated and 
more empirical data was available for adequate evaluation of 
the claims presented.  In Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302 
(1989), the Court considered a constitutional claim that 
execution of mentally retarded people violated the Eighth 
Amendment ban against "cruel and unusual punishment."  The 
Court refused to endorse this constitutional claim but, at the 
same time, explicitly refused to rule out the possibility that 
future actions by state legislatures might someday justify the 
Court's proclamation of such a right. </p>

<P>In a case decided just one year earlier, Justice O'Connor 
was equally explicit that constitutional judgment should be 
withheld until state legislatures had independently deliberated 
on the matter.  In Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 815 
(1988), the Court divided four-to-four on the question whether 
the Constitution forbade execution of a person under 16 years 
of age.  In her separate opinion which constituted the rule of 
the case, Justice O'Connor refused to resolve the constitutional 
question and instead held only that no such juvenile could be 
executed without explicit statutory prescription by the state 
legislature.  Id. at 855.  Justice O'Connor concluded that more 
"careful consideration" on this issue should take place among 
state legislatures.  Id. </p>
<P>The Eighth Amendment may appear especially hospitable 
to such deference to evolving legislative attitudes and 
experience since it forbids not simply "cruel" but also 
"unusual" punishments, and the Court has held that legislative 
actions might themselves be a measure of "unusualness."   
Nonetheless there is a more fundamental parallel between the 
jurisprudence of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments 
which establishes the equal relevance of state legislative 
actions for judicial interpretations of other constitutional 
provisions.</p>

<P>3.	Interpreting Fourteenth Amendment 
"privacy" or "liberty" interests.	<br>
In Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 100-01 (1958), the Court 
stated "that the words of the [Eighth] Amendment are not 
precise, and that their scope is not static.  The Amendment 
must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency 
that mark the progress of a maturing society."  This 
evolutionary conception is precisely the interpretive guide that 
Justice Harlan identified in his now-classic concurring opinion 
in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 499 (1965), 
incorporating by reference his dissenting opinion in Poe v. 
Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 522 (1961) ("Due process has not been 
reduced to any formula . . . .  [I]t has represented the balance 
which our Nation, built upon postulates of respect for the 
individual, has struck between that liberty and the demands of 
organized society . . . having regard to what history teaches are 
the traditions from which it developed as well as the traditions 
from which it broke.  That tradition is a living thing."  367 
U.S. at 542).</p>
<P>In interpreting the Fourteenth Amendment due process 
guarantee in Griswold, it is clear that Justice Harlan gave the 
same weight to the accumulated actions and experience of 
state legislatures generally as the Court gave in its 
interpretations of the Eighth Amendment in Penry and 
Thompson.  Justice Harlan stated, "[C]onclusive, in my view, 
is the utter novelty of this enactment.  Although the Federal 
Government and many States have at one time or other had on 
their books statutes forbidding or regulating the distribution of 
contraceptives, none . . . has made the use of contraceptives a 
crime."  Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. at 554 (emphasis in original).
In evaluating the Fourteenth Amendment due process 
claim advanced in the instant case, the absence of any state 
legislative endorsement except for the "utter novelty" of the 
Oregon statute leads to the conclusion that a constitutional 
right to physician-assisted suicide is not yet supported by a 
sufficient "national consensus" (Penry) or by "evolving 
standards of decency" (Trop) or by "the balance which our 
Nation . . . has struck between . . . liberty and the demands of 
organized society" (Griswold).  The Courts of Appeals' 
decisions in this case turn Justice Harlan's reasoning upside 
down:  instead of relying on the collective judgments of forty-
nine states to support the imposition of a constitutional rule on 
one, these decisions effectively impose one lone state's 
judgment on the other forty-nine.</p>
<P>It is also relevant that when this Court invalidated state 
laws restricting abortion in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), 
abortions were legally available in every state in some 
circumstances: to save the mother's life in all states, to 
safeguard the mother's physical or mental health in "about one 
third of the states" and simply on demand in four states.  See 
id. at 139-40 & n. 37.  (Indeed, the statutory criteria regarding 
the mother's physical or mental health were so liberally 
construed in some states as to virtually amount to a regime of 
abortion on demand.  See Kristin Luker, ABORTION AND THE 
POLITICS OF MOTHERHOOD, 88-95 (1984).)  State legislative 
endorsement of abortion was thus not an "utter novelty" as it 
currently is for physician-assisted suicide.</p>
<P>II.	CONSTITUTIONAL RESOLUTION IS 
PREMATURE BECAUSE SUBSTANTIAL 
UNCERTAINTIES EXIST REGARDING THE 
POSSIBILITY OF DESIGNING EFFECTIVE 
SAFEGUARDS FOR THE PRACTICE OF 
PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE.	</p>
<P>Both the Second and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals 
insisted that the constitutional right to physician-assisted 
suicide must only apply to individuals who voluntarily request 
it, who are mentally competent and who are terminally ill.  See 
Compassion in Dying v. Washington, 79 F.3d at 793; Quill v. 
Vacco, 80 F.3d 716, 718 (2d Cir.), cert. granted, 135 L. Ed. 
2d. 1127 (1996).  Both courts acknowledged that states have a 
legitimate interest in prescribing safeguards to ensure that the 
practice is strictly limited to volunteering, mentally competent, 
terminally ill people.  See 79 F.3d at 832-33; 80 F.3d at 730-31 
& n. 4.  Both courts assumed that sufficient empirical 
knowledge and professional experience were currently 
available on which states might rely in designing such 
safeguards.  79 F.3d at 826, 831, 833; 80 F.3d at 730-31.
These assumptions about the current preparedness of the 
states and the medical profession to design effective 
safeguards are false.  For patients who might request 
physician-assisted suicide, there are considerable practical 
problems in assuring voluntariness, in both diagnosing and 
appropriately treating mental incompetence, and in 
determining terminal prognoses.  These problems might be 
overcome in the future if empirical research is conducted and, 
in particular, if the new Oregon statute comes into effect and is 
carefully monitored, and if currently untested changes in 
medical education and institutional practices are implemented 
to prepare physicians for this novel, legally-recognized role.  
But there is no sufficient current basis in practical experience 
or rigorous empirical research for any confidence that 
adequate safeguards can be developed.  The courts below have 
no basis for their assumptions that physician-assisted suicide 
can in practice be appropriately restricted to voluntary, 
mentally competent, terminally ill people. It is thus clearly 
premature for the judiciary to declare the existence of a 
constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide on the 
premise that this right must extend only to voluntary, mentally 
competent, terminally ill people. </p>
<P>A.	Voluntariness</P>
<P>1.	A dying person suffering from intense pain 
cannot voluntarily choose suicide unless 
available, effective pain treatment is offered.</p>
<P>The most powerful and poignant argument on behalf of 
legalizing physician-assisted suicide is to provide release for 
terminally ill people from intense, intractable pain.  For 
anyone forced to choose between continued life with such pain 
and the release of death, the pain obviously exerts an 
enormous and even overwhelming coercive impact.  This 
impact in itself obviously cannot justify characterizing a 
choice for death as "involuntary."  If, however, this pain is 
actually avoidable but the suffering individual is neither 
informed of this fact nor given the opportunity to alleviate this 
terrible pain, then this individual is not acting voluntarily in 
choosing death as the only or even the preferred way to end 
suffering.</p>
<P>Many dying people in this country today are suffering 
from insufficiently treated pain.   Medically effective 
techniques for completely alleviating this pain are available for 
almost all of these people; according to knowledgeable 
physicians and researchers, this is possible in as many as 
ninety-eight percent of cancer cases.   But the medical 
profession generally is neither informing patients of this 
possibility nor providing this palliative care. </p>
<P>We do not adequately understand the reasons for this 
failure by the medical profession; nor do we understand how 
this medical failure can be effectively remedied.  There are 
many possible explanations, such as:  insufficient knowledge 
among physicians about pain management because of 
inadequate professional training; state and federal legal 
restrictions on availability of controlled substances for pain 
relief and/or physician misconceptions about the legal 
restrictions; failure even to acknowledge a patient's pain 
because of unwillingness or inability of physicians and other 
medical personnel to engage in more than perfunctory 
conversation, or in many cases any conversation, with patients 
who are perceived as dying. </p>
<P>The explanation for this failure cannot plausibly be cruelty 
or callousness of the medical profession; there is widespread 
acknowledgment and dismay within the profession about our 
failure to provide even minimally adequate pain palliation for 
most dying people.  But we do not know enough about the 
causes of this failure to prescribe confidently effective 
remedies for it.</p>
<P>The most recent and disturbing indication of our ignorance 
is the research results of the so-called SUPPORT project.  This 
four year study involving nine thousand seriously ill adult 
patients in five U.S. teaching hospitals was designed "to 
improve end-of-life decision making and reduce the frequency 
of a mechanically supported, painful, and prolonged process of 
dying."  Alfred P. Connors, et al., A Controlled Trial to 
Improve Care for Seriously Ill Hospitalized Patients; The 
Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes 
and Risks of Treatments  (SUPPORT),  274 JAMA 1591 
(1995).  Phase I of the study, to establish the empirical base-
line of practices current in 1989-91, documented that overall 
"50% of all conscious . . . patients who died in the hospital 
experienced moderate or severe pain at least half the time 
during their last 3 days of life" although there was "substantial 
variation" among the five hospitals.  Id. at 1594.   In Phase II, 
conducted in 1992-94, patients were divided into intervention 
and control groups, with the intervention group receiving 
intensive services from a "specially trained nurse" who, among 
other functions, facilitated communication and "encouraged 
attention to pain control" between the medical care team and 
patients and their families.  274 JAMA at 1591.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, this "phase II intervention failed to improve 
care or patient outcomes."  Id.  In particular, reports of 
untreated pain during the last three days of life actually 
somewhat increased among intervention group patients as 
compared to control group patients.  Id. at 1595.</p>
<P>The SUPPORT study was the most comprehensive 
research on the experience of dying patients ever conducted in 
this country.  The failure of its intervention not simply to 
correct but even to measurably affect the problem of 
unnecessary but untreated pain among dying patients is a 
puzzling result.   Amicus curiae, the Project on Death in 
America of the Open Society Institute, is currently supporting 
the establishment of palliative treatment programs as well as 
research into the effectiveness of such programs in medical 
centers throughout the country.  We hope that this work will 
soon demonstrate a considerable improvement of the current, 
intolerable regime of dying patients suffering unnecessary, 
treatable pain.</p>
<P>So long, however, as substantial numbers of dying people 
are unnecessarily suffering from treatable pain, no one can 
claim that an individual's choice to end his life rather than 
endure pain is a sufficiently voluntary act.  States cannot 
design adequate safeguards to assure that every suffering 
person has access to available pain control treatment when we 
do not yet understand the reasons why such treatment is not 
being provided to large numbers of patients.  Until state 
authorities, assisted by medical researchers, have understood 
these reasons and identified effective remedies, judicial 
pronouncement of a right to physician-assisted suicide, 
premised on the voluntary character of an individual's choice, 
would clearly be premature.</p>
<P>It is also possible that, in itself, recognition of a right to 
physician-assisted suicide would create barriers to the 
provision of effective pain control and other symptomatic 
relief to dying patients.  This paradoxical result could arise 
because some pharmacologic measures that are medically 
necessary to relieve intense pain or other symptoms can also 
have the unintended effect of hastening death.  Even though 
such measures violate neither legal nor ethical proscriptions, 
some physicians are currently reluctant to administer adequate 
palliative medications because of their potential life-shortening 
effect.   If physician-assisted suicide were legalized and 
accompanied by stringent procedural safeguards, many more 
physicians might conclude that even their current practices of 
pain control might require observance of these stringent new 
procedures.  The net result could be the imposition of new 
barriers to the provision of currently recognized palliative care 
measures, thus increasing the already large numbers of 
patients who suffer needlessly from inadequate pain control.  
This paradoxical result would not inevitably follow from 
legalized physician-assisted suicide, but carefully designed 
implementation measures would be required to guard against 
this possibility.  In common, however, with all of the current 
barriers to inadequate medical provision of palliative 
measures, we do not yet know enough about the underlying 
reasons for these barriers in order to design effective remedies 
to overcome them.</p>
<P>2.	Undue financial pressures can undermine 
the voluntariness of a dying person's choice 
for suicide.</p>	
<P>Prolonged dying from chronic illness, which is the 
increasingly common mode of death in this country, can be 
extremely expensive for patients and their families, as well as 
for pivate and public health insurers. </p>
<P>Institutional arrangements in the delivery of health care are 
now in the midst of a fundamental transformation, as 
increasingly large numbers of patients are choosing, or are 
being forced by their employers or by state agencies to accept, 
the provision of medical treatment through managed care 
organizations.  "The most troubling issue for end-of-life care 
in managed care is the possibility that clinicians are changed 
from being patients' advocates to having a personal stake in 
withholding treatment that would be in the patients' interests."  
Steven Miles, et al., End-of-Life Treatment in Managed Care: 
The Potential and the Peril, 163 Western J. Med. 302, 304 
(1995).</p> 
<P>Because the dominance of managed care organizations in 
American health care is relatively recent, there has been little 
systematic study of the extent of inappropriate cost-cutting 
pressures on patients.  But if physician-assisted suicide 
suddenly becomes a constitutionally-sanctioned option for all 
patients, it is certainly plausible and perhaps even likely that 
budget-minded health care organization managers and their 
physician-employees would press their dying patients toward 
exercising this option.</p>
<P>Perhaps traditional patient-centered medical ethics would 
guard against this improper pressure; perhaps external 
regulation of the new health care organizations would 
adequately protect dying patients against undue influence.  But 
our experience of managed care is too new for any confident 
claims on this score.  And yet, as Judge Reinhardt's opinion for 
the Ninth Circuit explicitly recognized, without carefully 
designed safeguards to counteract "the risk of undue 
influence" for financial gain, a dying person's choice of 
physician-assisted suicide would not be a truly voluntary act.  
79 F.3d at 826.</P>
<P>Unjustified financial pressures would be even more 
powerful for the large proportion of the American public 
without any health insurance, some thirty-seven million 
according to recent estimates.   Once again Judge Reinhardt's 
opinion noted the problem ("We would be inclined to agree 
that the country's refusal to provide universal health care, and 
the concomitant suffering so many Americans are forced to 
undergo, demonstrates a serious flaw in our national values," 
79 F.3d at 826), but nonetheless failed to acknowledge the 
central relevance of this problem to the constitutional 
legitimization of physician-assisted suicide.  Unless there can 
be adequate assurances that no person chooses physician-
assisted suicide because of poverty, this choice cannot be 
considered sufficiently voluntary.  The judiciary is, however, 
neither institutionally capable nor constitutionally authorized 
to create a system to guarantee health care regardless of 
income.   If there should be a right to physician-assisted 
suicide, it must be accompanied by general recognition of 
society's obligation to ensure access to adequate health care. 
The judiciary acting alone cannot achieve this goal.</p>



<P>B.	Mental Competence</p>

<P>1.	Judgment-impairing confusion is common 
among dying persons but is surprisingly 
difficult to identify as such.	</p>
<P>"Confusional states are common" among dying people 
and, accordingly, "obtaining a truly informed consent is 
problematic."   It might seem self-evident that such 
confusional states would be readily detected by physicians or 
even by lay observers such as family members, and requests 
for assisted suicide would be appropriately disregarded.  In 
actual practice, however, the detection of judgment-impairing 
confusion among dying people is surprisingly difficult.   </p>
<P>Based on several studies of dying patients, one researcher 
concluded that "our clinical observations miss profound 
confusional episodes in 20 percent of our patients." </p>
<P>These results are consistent with more general 
observations in the SUPPORT study about shortcomings in 
communications between physicians and dying patients.  The 
SUPPORT study found in Phase I that, of the patients who had 
expressed preferences for withholding cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation, "only 47% of their physicians accurately 
reported this preference."  274 JAMA at 1594.  In Phase II, for 
the intervention group in which a specially trained nurse talked 
with both physicians and patients on a regular basis regarding 
patient preferences, among other things, the SUPPORT study 
found essentially no improvement in physicians' 
understanding of patients' preferences.  </p>
<P>It thus appears that dying patients and their physicians are 
generally reluctant to talk with one another about matters of 
profound importance ("discussions and decisions substantially 
in advance of death were uncommon," 274 JAMA at 1595), 
and that there are substantial misperceptions between 
physicians and patients when conversations do occur.  (These 
profound silences and miscommunications between physician 
and dying patients are often mirrored in general doctor-patient 
interactions.  See generally Jay Katz, THE SILENT WORLD OF 
DOCTOR AND PATIENT (1984).)</p>
<P>This pattern of persistently missed communications 
appears to confirm the finding that physicians and nurses 
regularly overstate dying patients' decision-making 
competence.  Whatever the reasons, it is clear that state 
authorities and medical professional groups face a very 
difficult task, and currently have inadequate experience or 
research data, in order to design reliable safeguards to ensure 
the lucidity of dying patients who might claim a right to 
assisted suicide.  </p>


<P>2.	Judgment-impairing depression is common 
among dying persons and, not surprisingly, 
is difficult to identify as such.	</p>
<P>Distinguishing between a dying person's profound sadness 
and an appropriate psychiatric diagnosis of clinical depression 
is exceedingly difficult.   For many reasons, however, 
drawing this distinction with accuracy and sensitivity is 
important in designing appropriate treatment for all dying 
people in order to provide the greatest possible satisfactions 
(for conversations, for reconciliations, for good leave-takings) 
for them and for their families.  Identifying clinical depression 
is even more important when crucial decisions, such as 
refusing further medical treatment or requesting assisted 
suicide, are at stake; clinical depression, which commonly 
carries deep feelings of personal worthlessness and 
hopelessness, distorts an individual's rational capacity to make 
choices.</p>
<P>There has been little systematic research regarding the 
mental status of dying people who request assisted suicide or 
refuse life-prolonging treatment.  The limited available 
investigations suggest two propositions:  first, that among 
terminally ill patients "the desire for death could be quite 
variable over time"; and second, that clinical differentiation 
between a "psychologically stable" and a distorted decision is 
"in practice . . . a difficult distinction to make without actually 
initiating a course of treatment."  Harvey Max Chochinov, et 
al., Desire for Death in the Terminally Ill, 152 Am. J. 
Psychiatry 1185, 1189-90 (1995).</p>
<P>Safeguards could be designed for the administration of 
physician-assisted suicide to take account of these 
considerations.  It is not clear, however, that the procedures 
currently followed in the Netherlands -- the only country with 
any experience of this legally recognized practice -- do give 
adequate attention to the related issues of temporal instability 
and the difficulties of accurate psychiatric diagnosis.  As 
Chochinov, et al. observe, "Although the Dutch guidelines are 
explicit with respect to the requirement that the request for an 
assisted death must be persistent over time, it has been 
reported that in practice, 65% of all euthanasia deaths occur 
within 2 weeks of the initial request" -- a time span which 
would be too brief to take account of the "temporal instability 
of the desire for death that was observed in our group" of 
patients.  Id. at 1190.</p>
<P>The Ninth Circuit has specified that, consistent with its 
finding of a constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide, a 
state may adopt regulations requiring "reasonable, though 
short, waiting periods to prevent rash decisions."  79 F.3d at 
833 (emphasis added).  Would that court consider a two-week 
waiting period too short, just right, or too long to give 
adequate respect to a dying person's constitutional right to 
make a voluntary, mentally competent choice for physician-
assisted suicide?  There is today insufficient practical 
experience and empirical research for rendering any confident 
judgment on the lapse of time necessary to assure that an 
individual's decision is not "rash" or clouded by depression or 
other psychiatric illness.  This is yet another uncertainty that 
attends the administration of physician-assisted suicide, and 
yet another reason that it is premature for courts to take 
constitutional command of this issue.</p>
<P>C.	Prognosis of Terminal Illness</p>
<P>Both of the courts below explicitly limited the 
constitutional right for assisted suicide to "terminally ill" 
people.  Both courts were confident, moreover, that reliable 
identification of "terminally ill" people would not be 
especially difficult.  The Second Circuit stated, "[I]t seems 
clear that most physicians would agree on the definition of 
'terminally ill,' at least for the purpose of the relief that 
plaintiffs seek."  80 F.3d at 731.  The Ninth Circuit stated that 
"the experience of the states has proved that the class of the 
terminally ill is neither indefinable nor undefined."  79 F.3d at 
831.</p>
<P>Both courts are correct that physicians in various contexts 
are required to determine whether a patient has a "terminal 
illness."  For example, for purposes of admission to hospice 
programs and eligibility for the Medicare hospice benefit, a 
patient must be diagnosed as likely to die within six months.  
There is, however, a substantial degree of uncertainty that 
attends this prognosis. </p>
<P>Whatever the justifications for using "terminal illness" 
predictions in medical decisionmaking, there are special 
problems that arise when courts use statistical reasoning in 
determining whether an individual does or does not have a 
constitutional right.  The use of "terminal illness" by the courts 
below serves to exclude people from exercise of what is held 
to be a constitutional right.  </p>
<P>If a state legislature were to enact such a predictive 
criterion for excluding people from the exercise of a 
constitutional right, courts would not hesitate to overturn this 
restriction on grounds of overinclusive and underinclusive 
violations of strict scrutiny review.  To predict accurately that 
100 individuals have a 50% chance of dying within six 
months, for example, means that in the aggregate 50 of them 
will die and 50 will not, but it is impossible to determine 
whether a given individual will be among the living or the 
dead at the end of the six month period.  Accordingly, it is 
overinclusive to award the constitutional right for choosing 
assisted suicide to the surviving half of these 100 people.  At 
the same time, the predictive model cannot definitively 
establish that no one except these 100 individuals with similar 
prognostic characteristics will die of a given disease within six 
months.  Accordingly, it is underinclusive to exclude from the 
constitutional entitlement people with statistically better 
prognoses who will in fact die during the six-month period.
If courts refrain from proclaiming a constitutional right in 
this matter, state legislatures could adopt laws restricting 
physician-assisted suicide to "terminally ill" people without 
transgressing the mandate of strict scrutiny.  The new Oregon 
enactment does limit its authorization for assisted suicide to 
adults "suffering from a terminal disease," defined as "an 
incurable and irreversible disease that has been medically 
confirmed and will, within reasonable medical judgment, 
produce death within six months."  OR. REV. STAT., tit. 13, ch. 
127,  2.01, 1.01(12).  Courts have held that, in the absence 
of any infringement on constitutionally protected liberties, 
such restrictions are valid exercises of legislative authority.  
See Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483, 489 (1955).
This cautiously incremental methodology is readily 
available to legislatures but not to courts in constitutional 
adjudication.  A court is not free to pronounce constitutional 
rights by selecting only "one phase of one field . . . [while] 
neglecting the others" any more than a legislature would be 
free to enact arbitrary limits on the availability of court-
proclaimed constitutional rights.  Id.  Regarding physician-
assisted suicide, moreover, this "one step" for terminally ill 
people has been taken thus far only by one state.  As Justice 
Brandeis observed in New State Ice Co., "it is one of the happy 
incidents of the federal system" that this one state can act 
"without risk to the rest of the country."  285 U.S. at 311.  
The very fact that the courts below felt compelled to limit 
the reach of their proclaimed constitutional right to this 
inherently imprecise and individually indeterminable category 
of the "terminally ill" itself demonstrates their implicit 
understanding that reform in this sensitive and uncertain area 
should proceed "one step at a time."  The patent unsuitability 
of this category in constitutional adjudication itself 
demonstrates that the entire subject-matter of physician-
assisted suicide is, at this early moment in public and 
legislative deliberations about it, not ripe for constitutional 
resolution.</p>
<P><B>CONCLUSION</b><BR>
There is no practical experience in any state with the 
administration of legally recognized physician-assisted 
suicide, even in the one state where it has only recently been 
legislatively approved.  Although the courts below in the 
instant cases held that a constitutional right to physician-
assisted suicide must be limited only to voluntary, mentally 
competent, terminally ill people, there are serious questions -- 
which cannot be answered based on currently available 
knowledge and experience -- about whether any of these 
limitations can be adequately determined in practice.  Until 
additional practical experience and systematic research occurs 
regarding these questions -- in the "laboratories of the states" -- 
it would be premature to declare whether or not there is a 
federal constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide.  
Accordingly, the decisions of the courts below should be 
reversed on the ground that the issue presented was not ripe 
for constitutional adjudication.</p>
<P>Dated:	November 8, 1996<BR>
Respectfully submitted,<BR>
Robert A. Burt<BR>
Attorney for Amicus Curiae</P><hr>




	

<P>  	Each party has given its consent, in writing, to the filing of this brief 
amicus curiae.  Letters indicating such consent have been filed with the 
Clerk of the Court.</p>
<P>  	The Court observed, "We follow the judicious counsel of our decision 
in Twin City Bank v. Nebeker, 167 U.S. 196 (1897), where we said that in 
deciding 'a question of such magnitude and importance . . . it is the [better] 
part of wisdom not to attempt, by any general statement, to cover every 
possible phase of the subject.' "  497 U.S. at 277.</p>
<P> 	Justice O'Connor stated:<BR>
Today's decision, holding only that the Constitution permits a State to 
require clear and convincing evidence of Nancy Cruzan's desire to 
have artificial hydration and nutrition withdrawn, does not preclude a 
future determination that the Constitution requires the States to 
implement the decisions of a patient's duly appointed surrogate.  Nor 
does it prevent States from developing other approaches for protecting 
an incompetent individual's liberty interest in refusing medical 
treatment.  As is evident from the Court's survey of state court 
decisions . . . no national consensus has yet emerged on the best 
solution for this difficult and sensitive problem.  Today we decide only 
that one State's practice does not violate the Constitution; the more 
challenging task of crafting appropriate procedures for safeguarding 
incompetents' liberty interests is entrusted to the "laboratory" of the 
States, New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann . . . (Brandeis, J., dissenting), in 
the first instance.  (497 U.S. at 292).</P>
<P>  	In another case that also directly impinged on constitutional rights in 
physician-patient relations, this Court was equally unwilling to impose a 
"simpl[e] and stark" constitutional rule.  In Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589 
(1977), the state had required physicians to report the names and addresses 
of patients for whom they prescribed certain medications and a lower court 
ruled that this requirement invaded "one of the zones of privacy accorded 
constitutional protection" in the doctor-patient relationship.  The Supreme 
Court acknowledged that the state regulation had "some effect on 
individual liberty or privacy" but nonetheless concluded that "individual 
States [must] have broad latitude in experimenting with possible solutions 
to problems of vital local concern."  Id. at 597.</p>
<P>  	The Court stated:<BR>
Only one state [Georgia] . . . currently bans execution of retarded 
persons.  . . .  Maryland has enacted a similar statute which will take 
effect [imminently].  . . .  [The petitioner] points to several public 
opinion surveys that indicate strong public opposition to execution of 
the retarded. . . .  The public sentiment expressed in these and other 
polls and resolutions may ultimately find expression in legislation, 
which is an objective indicator of contemporary values upon which we 
can rely.  But at present, there is insufficient evidence of a national 
consensus . . . for us to conclude that it is categorically prohibited by 
the Eighth Amendment.  (492 U.S. at 334-35).</p>
<P> 	Justice O'Connor wrote:<BR>
The day may come when we must decide whether a legislature may 
deliberately and unequivocally resolve upon a policy authorizing 
capital punishment for crimes committed at the age of 15. . . . In my 
view, however, we need not and should not decide the question today. </P>

<P>By leaving open for now the broader Eighth Amendment question 
. . . , the approach I take allows the ultimate moral issue at stake in the 
constitutional question to be addressed in the first instances by those 
best suited to do so, the people's elected representatives.  (Id.  at 855, 
858-59).</p>
<P>  	Amicus Curiae believes that in the specific substantive contexts of 
these cases, the Court erred in refusing to prohibit on constitutional 
grounds the execution of mentally retarded persons or of minors under 
sixteen.  Amicus relies on these cases only for the jurisprudential 
proposition that the Court may decline to declare a constitutional right 
while explicitly holding open the possibility of a future judicial declaration 
based on further state legislative developments.</p>
<P>  Similar difficulties may exist in assuring the voluntariness and mental 
competence of gravely ill individuals who refuse life-prolonging treatment.  
But the possible existence of such similarities provides no reason for 
extending a constitutional right from this narrower context of an 
individual's liberty interest in resisting unconsented bodily intrusions; the 
possible similarities provide strong reasons for caution rather than 
expansive adjudication. This Court, moreover, was appropriately cautious 
in its consideration of constitutional claims to refuse treatment in Cruzan v. 
Director, Missouri Dep't of Health, 497 U.S. 261 (1990),  acting only after  
this right had been recognized during the preceding fifteen years by some 
fourteen state appellate court decisions.  Id. at 277 n. 6.  By contrast, only 
one state supreme court has just recently addressed the question of 
physician-assisted suicide presented in this case, People v. Kevorkian, 447 
Mich. 436, 527 N.W.2d 714 (1994), cert. denied sub nom., Hobbins v. 
Kelley, 115 S.Ct. 1795 (1995), and refused to find a constitutional right in 
the context of Jack Kevorkian's ministrations in that state.</p>
<P> 	How commonly pain marks the actual experience of dying is 
uncertain, and estimates vary substantially across institutions, whether 
hospices or hospitals.  Coyle et al. reported that three of every four 
cancer patients had pain.  Bonica's review of published reports 
indicates that more than half of cancer patients have severe pain.  
Saunders has claimed that one fourth of cancer patients have 
inadequate pain control when dying.</p>

Dying Patient, 275 JAMA 474, 475 (1996) (citations omitted) (hereinafter, 
Good Care of the Dying Patient).  See also C.S. Cleeland, et al., Pain and 
Its Treatment in Outpatients with Metastatic Cancer, 330 N. Eng. J. Med. 
592 (1994).</p>
<P> 	[O]nly 2% of patients in hospice care experience pain that is difficult 
for a skilled team to manage.  With the exception of one study, other 
investigators confirm this low rate of serious pain persisting in systems 
of care that emphasize pain management.  The rates of pain in persons 
who are dying of diseases other than cancer are not [however] well 
described.</p>
<P>Good Care of the Dying Patient, 275 JAMA at 475 (citations omitted).  </p>
<P> 	The potential for management of pain has recently improved, both 
through the development of better techniques and through enhanced 
care delivery through hospice and palliative care efforts. . . .  Although 
guidelines and a curriculum on pain management have been 
developed, oncologists and others report serious perceived 
shortcomings in management of cancer pain.</p>
<P>Good Care of the Dying Patient, 275 JAMA at 475.  Other distressing 
symptoms of dying patients, in addition to pain, are also inadequately 
treated by physicians.  See Susan Block & Andrew Billings, Patient 
Requests to Hasten Death:  Evaluation and Management in Terminal Care, 
154 Arch. Intern. Med. 2039, 2040 (1994) ("Other symptoms [beyond 
pain] (eg., dyspnea, anorexia, nausea, constipation, insomnia, and anxiety) 
regularly plague terminally ill patients and are often inadequately 
controlled by physicians who lack expertise in palliative care or fail to take 
an aggressive stance toward assuring patient comfort.").</p>
<P> 	See Kathleen Foley, The Relationship of Pain and Symptom 
Management to Patient Requests for Physician-Assisted Suicide, 6 J. Pain 
& Symptom Mgmt. 289, 290-93 (1991); M.B. Max, Improving Outcomes 
of Analgesic Treatment:  Is Education Enough? 113 Ann. Int. Med. 885 
(1990); J.H. Von Rouenn, et al., Physician Attitudes and Practice in 
Cancer Pain Management, 119 Ann. Int. Med. 121 (1993).</p>
<P>  	This base-line result was consistent with numerous other prior research 
reports.  See Cancer Pain Relief and Palliative Care, 19, World Health 
Organization (Report of a WHO Expert Committee) (1990).</p>
<P> 	As the researchers observed:<BR>
<P>The study certainly casts a pall over any claim that, if the health care 
system is given additional resources for collaborative decision making 
in the form of skilled professional time, improvements will occur. . . .  
[T]he overall results of this study are not encouraging.  No pattern 
emerged that implied that the intervention was successful for some set 
of patients or physicians or that its impact increased over time.  The 
five hospitals had been chosen for their diversity and their willingness 
to undertake a substantial and controversial challenge.  Yet none 
showed a tendency toward improvement in these outcomes.

Patients' Families, 272 JAMA 1839 (1994).</p>
<P> 	As Miles, et al. observe:<BR>
Health maintenance organizations (HMOs), preferred provider plans, 
and managed indemnity insurance cover 80% of the privately insured 
persons in the United States.  Recent large-scale extensions of 
managed care to public programs of Medicare and Medicaid ensure 
the continued rapid growth of managed care.  The raison d'etre of 
managed care is to contain the growth of the cost of end-of-life care.  
About 10% of health care resources are used for the care of persons in 
their last year of life.  (163 Western J. Med. at 302).</P>
<P> 	See Michael Wines & Robert Pear, Health Costs Pose Problems for 
Millions, A Study Finds, N.Y. Times, Oct. 23, 1996, at A18, col. 1.<BR>
  	See, e.g., San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. <BR>
1 (1973) (complex issues regarding equalization of school financing are not 
amenable to judicial resolution based on a constitutional claim for equal 
protection); Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471 (1970) (state welfare law 
computations of family financial need are not amenable to judicial 
resolution based on equal protection claims).</p>

Frontiers in Controlling Confusion, Cachexia, and Dyspnea, 163 Western 
J. Med. 278, 280 (1995).</p>
<P> 	Physicians frequently fail to recognize cognitive impairment in 
hospitalized patients and may miss delirium because of its fluctuating 
features and subtle presentation.  When physician diagnosis is required 
to identify cases of delirium, reported rates have been quite low.  . . . 
Although physicians diagnosed delirium in only 8 patients, we found 
50 patients (22% of the study population) who met criteria for the 
disorder . . .  In this study of elderly patients on medical services, 
delirium occurred in over one fifth of subjects and was usually evident 
within 48 hours of admission.  Our prospective surveillance identified 
many more patients with delirium than were seen by psychiatric 
consultants or diagnosed by physicians.</p>
<P>J. Francis, et al., A Prospective Study of Delirium in Hospitalized Elderly, 
263 JAMA 1097, 1098, 1100 (1990).</p>
<P>  	Eduardo Bruera, Issues of Symptom Control in Patients with Advanced 
Cancer, Mar./Apr. 1993, Am. J. Hospice & Palliative Care, 13.</p>
<P> 	[D]epression and organic mental disorders are commonly seen among 
patients who request assistance in dying.  These disorders can both 
impair patient autonomy and coexist with autonomous wishes for 
hastened death. . . .  Determination of competence in this setting is 
often extraordinarily challenging, requiring subtle evaluations of 
thought processes and complex assessments of the patient's cognitive 
understanding, affective and emotional appreciation, and character 
limitations in understanding the implications of alternative choices.
Susan Block & Andrew Billings, Patient Requests for Euthanasia and 
Assisted Suicide in Terminal Illness:  The Role of the Psychiatrist, 36 
Psychosomatics 445, 451-2 (1995).  See also Nathan Cherny, et al., The 
Treatment of Suffering When Patients Request Elective Death, 10 J. 
Palliative Care 71, 73 (1994) ("Undertreatment [of depression among 
terminally ill patients] derives largely from the problems of recognition and 
assessment and from the misconception that depression is a normal 
response to cancer.").</p>
<P>  	See Joanne Lynn, Caring at the End of Our Lives, 334 N. Eng. J. Med. 
201 (1996).  Even though various objective scales for assessing terminal 
prognoses have been developed in recent years, in order to supplement the 
more subjective evaluations that individual physicians have always made, it 
is nevertheless true that all of these judgments remain uncertain.  "[T]he 
pace of dying is affected by many factors over a substantial period of time. 
. . .  Prognosticating will always be inescapably difficult."   Joanne Lynn, et 
al., Accurate Prognostications of Death: Opportunities and Challenges for 
Clinicians, 163 Western  J. Med. 250, 251 (1995).  "[N]o matter how 
sophisticated they become, objective probability estimates represent 
substantial simplifications of very complex systems."  William Knaus, et 
al., Short-Term Mortality Predictions for Critically Ill Hospitalized Adults: 
Science and Ethics, 254 Science 389, 393 (1991).  "The [predictive] 
models produce probability estimates.  They are developed and validated 
on large patient populations. . . . They have not been validated for 
individual patient decisions. . . . [W]e are far from achieving the goal of 
using individual patient level predictors to make difficult and painful 
decisions regarding . . . critically ill patients."  George Thibaut, The Use of 
Clinical Models for 'End of Life' Decisionmaking in Critically Ill ICU 
Patients, Summary of Committee Views and Workshop Examining the 
Feasibility of an Institute of Medicine Study of Dying, Decisionmaking, 
and Appropriate Care, 13:pp.1-3 (1994).</p>

MONITOR - A DAILY BRIEFING ON THE POST-SOVIET STATES<br>
<p>
IN THIS ISSUE:<br>
<p>
* Six Russian civilians are shot dead in Chechnya...<br>
* ...As Raduev releases unharmed his 22 hostages<br>
* ...And a delegation of North Ossetians is taken captive<br>
* Russian defense chief dashes hopes of a speedy accommodation with NATO<br>
* Another U.S. intelligence officer is accused of spying for Moscow<br>
* The Duma strives to blunt autonomy drives of resource-rich regions<br>
* Developments in Ajaria raise disturbing questions of Moscow's intentions<br>
* A summit on Tajikistan is jeopardized by widening political differences<br>
* A Canadian company launches a highly lucrative Kyrgyz gold field<br>
<p>
NEWS:<br>
<p>
DUMA RULES OUT PRIVATIZATION OF STRATEGIC ENTERPRISES. The Russian Duma has<br>
adopted in the first reading a law on the privatization of state property.<br>
The law sharply reduces the right of the state to hold a stake in private<br>
companies. It also reduces the extent to which foreign investors may invest<br>
in strategic sectors of the Russian economy. And it includes a list of<br>
strategic enterprises that may not be privatized at all. (Itar-Tass,<br>
December 18)<br>
<p>
PARLIAMENTARY LEADER WANTS MORE MONEY FOR DEFENSE. The chairman of the<br>
Russian Duma's Defense Committee said on December 17 that the 80 trillion<br>
rubles allocated for defense in 1996 failed to meet the army's minimal<br>
needs, and that his committee will work to raise defense spending in the<br>
1997 budget to at least 160 trillion rubles. (Interfax, December 17)<br>
Russia's Defense Ministry had originally requested 230 trillion rubles in<br>
1997, and later lowered that figure to 160 trillion. The government has<br>
earmarked just over 100 trillion rubles for defense in 1997. <br>
<p>
IRAQI OIL BAD NEWS FOR MOSCOW? Analysts say that Iraq's recent<br>
"oil-for-food" deal with the UN, strongly backed by Russia, could actually<br>
undermine profits earned by Moscow from some of its own oil exports. Russian<br>
Urals crude oil is said to be similar to Iraq's Kirkuk blend, and the two<br>
were competitors in the Mediterranean before the imposition of sanctions.<br>
Baghdad's reemergence could cost Russia customers and force Moscow to<br>
rethink the way it markets its oil, analysts say. (Reuter, December 18)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN SPACE EFFORT DEPENDS ON FOREIGN MONEY. In 1996, foreign investments<br>
in the Russian space industry accounted for nearly 40 percent of all funds<br>
invested, and the general director of the Russian Space Agency, Yuri Koptev,<br>
said he expected $600 million in foreign money next year. He said that the<br>
industry would need 5.1 trillion rubles ($935 million) from the state just<br>
to operate at a "subsistence level." Without this support Russia would not<br>
be able to participate in international space projects. (Interfax, December 18)<br>
<p>
WESTERN DONORS PLEDGE SUPPORT FOR UKRAINIAN REFORMS. International financial<br>
organizations and Western countries will provide $3.5 billion in 1997 to<br>
support Ukrainian economic reforms. Of this amount, $1.1 billion is to be<br>
granted by the IMF and $1 billion by the World Bank. The decision to provide<br>
the assistance was taken at a meeting of donor countries on December 17 in<br>
Washington, where tax reform and investment support projects put forward by<br>
the Ukrainian government were positively assessed. (Interfax, December 18)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
MORE VIOLENCE IN CHECHNYA. In a sinister echo of the murder one day earlier<br>
of six Red Cross workers, six elderly Russian civilians were shot dead<br>
yesterday in two separate houses in the Chechen capital. The victims --<br>
three men and three women -- were all aged over 60. As with the Red Cross<br>
workers, no evidence of theft was found, fueling suspicion that the motive<br>
was political. (RTR, BBC, December 18)<br>
<p>
Also yesterday, the bodies of the six Red Cross workers were flown from<br>
Chechnya to Switzerland. Traveling with them were 70 foreign nationals who<br>
had been working for the Red Cross in Chechnya. Virtually all international<br>
organizations have decided to pull out of Chechnya in the wake of the<br>
massacre. The exception was the Organization for Security and Cooperation in<br>
Europe, which announced its intention of staying. (RTR, December 18)<br>
<p>
RADUEV RELEASES HOSTAGES. At a checkpoint in Gerzel Raion on the border<br>
between Chechnya and Dagestan, meanwhile, a detachment of Chechen fighters<br>
under Salman Raduev yesterday released all 22 of the policemen that it had<br>
held hostage for the four preceding days. (Interfax, December 18) Raduev and<br>
Russian deputy security council secretary Boris Berezovsky had earlier<br>
signed a joint protocol ensuring that the hostages would be released without<br>
preconditions. But Magomet Tolboev, the secretary of Dagestan's Security<br>
Council, who also took part in the negotiations, has told the Monitor that<br>
one of Raduev's preconditions did make its way into the agreement.<br>
Berezovsky gave Raduev a guarantee that eleven of Raduev's fighters, who had<br>
been captured during the war, would be released from Russian prisons if the<br>
policemen were freed. Tolboev also told the Monitor that: "It was very<br>
important for Raduev not to lose face, and that is why he insisted on<br>
apologies from the Russian leadership. Our task boiled down to trying to get<br>
this done on a 'lower' level. In the end, it was agreed that the commander<br>
of the MVD detachment guarding the Dagestani-Chechen border would talk to<br>
Raduev. They met, and came to the conclusion that both of them were doing<br>
their duty as soldiers." Tolboev added that the talks had almost broken off<br>
because of provocations from the Russian military. <br>
<p>
On his return to Moscow, Berezovsky made an unexpected statement. He said<br>
that Raduev had been virtually forced to take the hostages. According to<br>
Berezovsky, when Raduev approached the Chechen-Dagestani border, Russian<br>
soldiers told him that he and his men must lay down their arms to cross the<br>
border. Raduev agreed to this condition, but Russian soldiers then tried to<br>
seize him. Berezovsky also said that there are forces, both in Chechnya and<br>
in Russia, who have an interest in disrupting the January elections, but he<br>
declined to say which of these forces were most active. Berezovsky also<br>
predicted that there would be more provocations in the future. (NTV,<br>
December 18)<br>
<p>
DELEGATION OF NORTH OSSETIANS SEIZED IN CHECHNYA. The welcome news that<br>
Raduev had released unharmed his 22 hostages was counterbalanced by fears<br>
for the safety of a delegation of high-ranking North Ossetian officials who<br>
were taken captive in northern Chechnya yesterday. The delegation included<br>
Schmidt Dzoblaev, the general secretary of the Assembly of<br>
National-Democratic and Patriotic Forces of Russia, Georgi Dzhigkaev, an<br>
adviser to the president of North Ossetia, and Soslan Sikoev, the deputy<br>
minister of internal affairs and a deputy to the republic parliament. A<br>
ransom of $6 million is said to have been demanded for their release. (RTR,<br>
Interfax, Vesti, December 18) North Ossetian president Akhsarbek Galazov has<br>
appealed to Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Security Council<br>
secretary Ivan Rybkin to take all necessary measures to ascertain the<br>
delegation's whereabouts. (Interfax, December 18) <br>
<p>
RODIONOV DELIVERS A STERN MESSAGE TO NATO. If NATO defense ministers thought<br>
that Igor Rodionov's recent switch from uniform to mufti would soften the<br>
former general's views about NATO expansion, they were quickly disabused of<br>
that notion when the Russian defense minister met with them in Brussels<br>
yesterday. All of their carefully-crafted language about not deploying<br>
nuclear weapons on the territory of any new members and of building a<br>
"strong, stable and enduring security partnership" with Russia fell on deaf<br>
ears. Rodionov reiterated Russia's adamant opposition to the plan in terms<br>
that one NATO official described as "the language of the past." Rodionov<br>
warned that Russia would be forced to take unspecified retaliatory measures<br>
and hinted that these would include an end to Russian cooperation in arms<br>
control. At a press conference following the meeting, Rodionov pointed out<br>
that the admission of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia<br>
would increase NATO's military potential by as much as 20 percent and would<br>
wipe out the buffer zone between Russia and NATO. <br>
<p>
NATO had hoped that Rodionov would agree to establish permanent military<br>
liaison offices at NATO Headquarters in Brussels and at the two major NATO<br>
military commands: the European headquarters at Mons, Belgium, and the<br>
Atlantic headquarters in Norfolk, Virginia. Rodionov discounted that idea,<br>
however, as being "premature." Russia does have a liaison officer at Mons<br>
because of its participation in the NATO-led Bosnian efforts.<br>
<p>
U.S. secretary of defense William Perry said after the meeting that it was<br>
clear there was "a broad and a deep perception in Russia that NATO expansion<br>
is a threat." He added that both NATO and the Russian government had to act<br>
to correct "this misperception." Other NATO officials suggested that<br>
Rodionov was really not the key player in the dialogue with NATO. In fact,<br>
the proposed Charter between the two parties is to be negotiated by<br>
Secretary-General Javier Solana and Russian foreign minister Yevgeni<br>
Primakov. (Interfax, Reuters, RFE/RL, Xinhua, December 18)<br>
<p>
FBI AGENT CHARGED WITH SPYING FOR MOSCOW. The U.S. intelligence community<br>
suffered yet another shock yesterday when a 13-year veteran of the FBI was<br>
arrested on charges of selling secrets to Moscow. The arrest of Earl Edwin<br>
Pitts, who joined the agency in 1983 and was employed most recently at the<br>
FBI's training facility in Quantico, Virginia, came exactly one month after<br>
Harold Nicholson, a high ranking CIA officer, was also charged with spying<br>
for Russia. (See Monitor, November 19-21) One unnamed U.S. official said<br>
that he knew of no connection between the two cases. Other sources suggested<br>
that Pitts' activities may have constituted a greater intelligence breach<br>
than those perpetrated by Nicholson -- whose own damage to U.S. security has<br>
been described as considerable. U.S. law enforcement organs had suffered an<br>
additional embarrassment in November when pressure and threats of<br>
retaliation from Moscow compelled them to release a former Soviet spy who<br>
had been arrested at New York's JFK airport. (See Monitor, November 6, 14, 18) <br>
<p>
U.S. officials yesterday indicated that Pitts, who is the second FBI agent<br>
ever to be arrested on espionage charges, had probably begun his illegal<br>
activities in the late 1980's when he was serving in a New York office of<br>
the FBI responsible for catching spies. In the early 1990's he became a<br>
supervisory agent at FBI headquarters. Reports varied on the question of<br>
whether Pitts had been moved in 1995 to the position in Quantico because he<br>
was under suspicion, or whether he had requested the transfer. (Reuter, AP,<br>
December 18)<br>
<p>
DUMA TRIES TO PREVENT RUSSIA'S REGIONS FROM BREAKING UP. The Russian Duma<br>
has adopted a bill intended to prevent smaller regions (autonomous okrugs)<br>
from seceding from larger one (krais and oblasts). There are eight<br>
autonomous okrugs (AOs) in Russia. Typically, they are sparsely populated,<br>
located in inhospitable areas, and rich in natural resources such as oil and<br>
gas. The 1992 Russian Federal Treaty put the AOs on an equal legal footing<br>
with the krais and oblasts, and the richer ones have been agitating ever<br>
since to set themselves up as independent entities. The krais and oblasts in<br>
question are understandably less keen on the idea, but a precedent was set<br>
in 1993, when the Constitutional Court allowed the Chukchi AO to secede from<br>
Magadan Oblast. That same year, the upper house of the Russian parliament<br>
adopted a resolution giving AOs the same rights as krais and oblasts, and<br>
their equality was reaffirmed by the 1993 constitution.<br>
<p>
The Yamalo-Nenets AO is now trying to secede from Tyumen oblast. The oblast<br>
is fighting back, since the AO occupies half its territory and produces<br>
almost all of its gas (in fact, it produces almost all of Russia's gas). The<br>
Yamalo-Nenets AO tried to secede from the oblast once before, in 1990, but<br>
came under strong pressure from the federal government not to do so. This<br>
time its leaders are sticking to their guns. For starters, they say they<br>
will not allow AO residents to participate in the elections for the governor<br>
of Tyumen oblast due to be held on December 22. <br>
<p>
The federal authorities oppose any rocking of the boat. The Duma has<br>
therefore weighed in with a hastily drafted Law on Ties between Regions and<br>
Autonomous okrugs. (Itar-Tass, December 18) The bill declares (a) that all<br>
the resources on the territory of the AOs are the property of the krai or<br>
oblast, and (b) that any elections must be held throughout the territory of<br>
each krai or oblast, that is, they must also be held in AOs wherever these<br>
exist. <br>
<p>
The bill now goes to the upper house of parliament. Yamalo-Nenets AO's newly<br>
elected governor has already called it "a blatant contradiction" of the<br>
Russian constitution. The problem is that, as is so often the case, Russian<br>
law is ambiguous. Yamalo-Nenets signed the 1992 Federal Treaty as part of<br>
Tyumen oblast, yet the Federal Treaty described them both as equals. It<br>
nonetheless appears that, if the Yamalo-Nenets leaders appeal to the<br>
Constitutional Court, they will have a strong case. If they win, other<br>
resource-rich AOs are sure to follow. Although no AO has yet expressed a<br>
desire to leave the Russian Federation, the federal authorities appear<br>
afraid that this could be the eventual result.<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
WHAT IS RUSSIA UP TO IN AJARIA? The office of Ajarian Supreme Soviet<br>
chairman Aslan Abashidze issued a special communiqu yesterday. It stated<br>
that the autonomous republic's internal affairs and "other law enforcement<br>
organs" (presumably meaning its KGB) have taken under their control the<br>
length of Ajaria's administrative border with the rest of Georgia, and are<br>
conducting "preventative exercises" in order to "stop armed groups wearing<br>
Georgian Internal Affairs Ministry uniforms from entering Abkhazia." The<br>
statement accused those groups of perpetrating acts of violence against<br>
local civilians along the administrative border, and charged that Tbilisi<br>
has ignored previous Abkhaz complaints on the issue. (Interfax, Itar-Tass,<br>
December 18)<br>
<p>
Issuance of the communiqu coincides precisely with the arrival of a Russian<br>
delegation allegedly representing Stavropol krai and headed by the commander<br>
of Russian border troops in the Caucasus (see Monitor, December 18). In a<br>
similar fashion, the arrival three weeks ago of a senior-level delegation<br>
from the command of the Russian Federal Border Service coincided exactly<br>
with the publication of an unprecedented statement by Abashidze that<br>
challenged Tbilisi's authority and demanded creation of a free economic zone<br>
in Ajaria's capital city of Batumi, where Russian border troops and other<br>
military facilities are based. In the interim between these two incidents,<br>
those Russian border troops in Batumi seized the Ukrainian ship Almaz and<br>
its crew, coordinating their action with Ajaria but not with Georgia. This<br>
series of actions raises the question of whether Ajaria is being nudged by<br>
Russia along the path of secession from Georgia.<br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
TAJIK SUMMIT IN MOSCOW MAY FOUNDER. Tajikistan's president, Imomali<br>
Rahmonov, and United Opposition chairman Saidabdullo Nuri are scheduled to<br>
meet today under Russian mediation in Moscow, in order to extend the<br>
ceasefire signed December 11 and to sign a political agreement on the<br>
principles of settling the conflict in Tajikistan. Amid conflicting reports<br>
on whether the meeting will actually be held on schedule, the only certainty<br>
seems to be that the opposition leadership has prevailed upon Nuri to revoke<br>
some of the unilateral concessions he had been pressured to make at the<br>
December 10-11 meeting under UN and Russian mediation. Opposition first<br>
vice-chairman Akbar Turajonzoda, the most sophisticated and worldly of the<br>
opposition leaders, has criticized the draft documents initialed at the<br>
December 10-11 Rahmonov-Nuri meeting, and demanded changes as a precondition<br>
to the opposition's acceptance of the Moscow "summit" and its results.<br>
Turanjozoda stated yesterday, without elaborating, that the opposition<br>
leadership has indeed introduced changes in the draft documents prepared for<br>
Moscow. (Interfax, Western agencies, December 18)<br>
<p>
The information that has been disseminated about those documents makes it<br>
possible to identify the main areas of disagreement. They are: the<br>
requirement that opposition forces withdraw from some recently captured<br>
areas; the intended creation of a purely decorative national conciliation<br>
commission, instead of real power-sharing arrangements; the idea of<br>
mandating observance of the ceasefire for the entire period of negotiations,<br>
thus lifting the pressure on Dushanbe to negotiate seriously; and the<br>
refusal by Dushanbe and Moscow to include the National Revival bloc (which<br>
broke away from the regime and moved closer to the opposition's views) as a<br>
third party in the Moscow negotiations. The fate of the Tajik summit in<br>
Moscow will turn mainly on those issues.<br>
<p>
KYRGYZ-CANADIAN JOINT VENTURE LAUNCHES GOLD PRODUCTION. Kumtor Gold, a joint<br>
venture in Kyrgyzstan of the Cameco Corporation of Saskatchewan, Canada,<br>
commissioned its ore-enrichment and processing plant at the Kumtor gold<br>
field yesterday. Addressing the opening ceremony at the site, Kyrgyz<br>
president Askar Akaev expressed the hope that the revenue from this project<br>
will finance Kyrgyzstan's industrial restructuring and conversion, and will<br>
also help persuade other Western companies to invest in Kyrgyzstan. <br>
<p>
The field, one of the world's largest and situated in the Tyan-Shan<br>
mountains at an altitude of more than 4,000 meters, is estimated to contain<br>
more than 500 tons of metallic gold. Mining at the site has been in progress<br>
since July. The processing plant, with a daily capacity of 14 tons of ore,<br>
is expected to produce 12 tons of metallic gold in 1997 and to reach full<br>
production at 18 to 19 tons annually in 1998, according to the joint<br>
venture's Canadian president, Len Humeniuk. The investment in the project<br>
amounts to 450 million US dollars. Kyrgyzstan will receive 70 percent and<br>
Cameco 30 percent of the commercial revenue, in proportion to their<br>
respective ownership shares. (Canadian Corp. News, Interfax, December 17)<br>

NEWS:<br>
<p>
RADUEV STILL HOLDING HOSTAGES. As of last night, Chechen rebel leader Salman<br>
Raduev had not released any of the 22 Russian hostages he and his men are<br>
holding somewhere on the Chechen-Dagestan border. Negotiations are being<br>
conducted by Russian deputy Security Council secretary Boris Berezovsky. He<br>
told Russian TV that provisional agreement had been reached to release the<br>
hostages within the next 24 hours. But Raduev said he was still awaiting an<br>
apology from the Russian and Dagestani authorities and from the Russian<br>
media. (ORT, December 17)<br>
<p>
UKRAINE DOESN'T RULE OUT APPLYING TO JOIN NATO. Ukrainian deputy foreign<br>
minister Anton Buteyko stated at a Kiev briefing yesterday that Ukraine no<br>
longer rules out the possibility of a future application for NATO<br>
membership. Ukraine's decisions will depend on the Russian parliament's<br>
actions, Buteyko said, evidently alluding to the territorial claims recently<br>
raised by both chambers of that body. (Itar-Tass, December 17; see also<br>
Perspective section below) Ukrainian officials have recently issued several<br>
warnings along these lines, but Buteyko's statement is unusually explicit.<br>
<p>
LEBED WINS LAWSUIT. Aleksandr Lebed yesterday won his defamation case<br>
against Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov. The court found no evidence to<br>
support Kulikov's allegations that Lebed had been plotting a coup. No one<br>
had believed the allegations, though they served as the pretext for Lebed's<br>
ouster from his post as Security Council secretary last October. The court<br>
ordered Kulikov to retract his statement and to pay Lebed symbolic damages<br>
of one ruble--less than one-tenth of one cent. Kulikov said he would appeal.<br>
(NTV, Itar-Tass, BBC, December 17)<br>
<p>
UN REFUGEE COMMISSION WITHDRAWS STAFF FROM DAGESTAN-CHECHEN BORDER. The<br>
United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) is evacuating the four<br>
UNHCR officials who have been working in the Dagestani village, Khasavyurt,<br>
on the Chechen border. They will be resettled in the Dagestani capital,<br>
Makhachkala. The decision follows the murder of six Red Cross workers in the<br>
Chechen village of Novyie Atagi early yesterday morning. (Itar-Tass,<br>
December 17)<br>
<p>
SENIOR MILITARY COMMANDER KILLED IN PLANE CRASH. Col. Gen. Sergei Seleznev,<br>
commander of the Leningrad Military District since 1991, was one of 17<br>
people killed when an An-12 military transport crashed yesterday soon after<br>
takeoff from an airfield in the Tver region. A four-engine turboprop<br>
aircraft, the An-12 is roughly equivalent to the U.S. C-130. It has been in<br>
service since 1960. (Interfax, December 17)<br>
<p>
CHARGES AGAINST NIKITIN APPARENTLY DROPPED. Nikolai Kovalev, director of the<br>
Federal Security Service (FSB), said yesterday in Moscow that he agreed with<br>
the prosecutor general's decision to release retired navy captain Aleksandr<br>
Nikitin (see Monitor, December 17). Kovalev explained that "it would be<br>
politically disadvantageous for us to charge Nikitin with espionage because<br>
Bellona [the Norwegian environmental organization employing Nikitin] would<br>
be indirectly charged too." Kovalev said he still believed Nikitin had<br>
committed espionage. (Interfax, December 17)<br>
<p>
PRIMAKOV CRITICIZED FOR SUPPORTING MILOSEVIC. Serbian opposition leader Vuk<br>
Draskovic slammed Russian foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov during a Russian<br>
TV interview on December 16 for Primakov's outspoken support of Serbian<br>
president Slobodan Milosevic. Draskovic accused Primakov of backing "the<br>
last Communist dictator in Europe," and said that the Russian minister had<br>
"insulted democratic Serbia by supporting the theft of our votes by<br>
Milosevic."  Primakov had earlier praised Milosevic and said he opposed<br>
outside interference in Belgrade's "internal affairs." (NTV, Itar-Tass,<br>
December 16)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN-CHINESE BORDER AGREEMENT UNDER FIRE. A Russian Foreign Ministry<br>
spokesman yesterday slammed Primorsky krai governor Yevgeny Nazdratenko for<br>
the latter's' criticism of the ongoing demarcation of the Russian-Chinese<br>
border. Grigori Tarasov called the criticism "excessively emotional" and<br>
"demagogic," and warned that Nazdratenko was undermining implementation of a<br>
treaty that fully serves Russia's interests. Tarasov's comments came as a<br>
working group from Russia's Federation Council also concluded that there<br>
ought to be amendments to the 1991 treaty governing the border demarcation.<br>
(Interfax, Itar-Tass, December 17)<br>
<p>
CONTRACT SIGNED FOR CHINESE PRODUCTION OF SU-27. Russian and Chinese<br>
officials yesterday signed the contract that will allow China to produce the<br>
Russian-designed Su-27 jet fighter. The Russians stressed that the process<br>
would be a long one and that China would likely not begin to build the<br>
planes for several years. Russia will first supply China with the aircraft,<br>
then provide kits that China will assemble, and finally provide parts. China<br>
will not be allowed to export the fighters it builds. (Interfax, December 17)<br>

RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
NATO DEFENSE MINISTERS PROD RUSSIA ON TACTICAL NUKES; URGE START II<br>
RATIFICATION. Meeting in Brussels, NATO defense ministers yesterday called<br>
on Russia to complete the reductions of tactical nuclear weapons it had<br>
promised in 1991 and 1992. The ministers were meeting as the Nuclear<br>
Planning Group, which does not include France. They also urged Russia to<br>
make "additional significant reductions" in its tactical nuclear weapons<br>
stockpile once the earlier rounds of cuts had been completed. (NATO<br>
Communique, December 17) In October 1991, former Soviet leader Mikhail<br>
Gorbachev had pledged that Russia would destroy one-half of its nuclear<br>
warheads for surface-to-air missiles and tactical aircraft bombs by 1996,<br>
one-half of its naval tactical nuclear weapons by 1995, and all nuclear<br>
artillery shells by 2000. Yeltsin made similar pledges in January 1992. In<br>
September of this year, U.S. defense secretary William Perry complained that<br>
Russia was dragging its feet in destroying these weapons. (Associated Press,<br>
September 22. See Monitor, September 23)<br>
<p>
While some Russian military leaders and politicians have suggested that<br>
Russia might aim its strategic missiles at Eastern and Central European<br>
countries that join NATO, these weapons are hardly suitable for such a role.<br>
Tactical nuclear weapons are another matter, and this could explain Moscow's<br>
apparent reticence to make deep cuts in this category of weaponry before its<br>
relations with NATO are clarified. <br>
<p>
The NATO ministers also urged Russia to ratify the START II treaty. Here<br>
they got an unexpected ally. The previous day Army General Igor Sergeev,<br>
commander-in-chief of the Russian Strategic Rocket Forces (SRF), threw his<br>
considerable weight behind the treaty. "We believe that Russia needs START<br>
II," he said, "because this document builds a balance of strategic nuclear<br>
forces." (Interfax, December 16) Many Russians have balked at some of the<br>
treaty's provisions, particularly the one that would eventually ban all<br>
land-based multiple-warhead strategic missiles. They feel that Russia has an<br>
advantage in this category and it would be prohibitively expensive to<br>
replace them with single-warhead missiles. <br>
<p>
KREMLIN DENIES YELTSIN'S DAUGHTER WILL GET OFFICIAL POST. With the budget<br>
debate over and President Yeltsin still secluded at a hunting lodge 70 miles<br>
from the capital, the Moscow political scene is unusually quiet. But rumors<br>
have filled the vacuum. Speculation that Anatoly Chubais will lose his post<br>
as head of the presidential administration has died down temporarily, to be<br>
replaced by rumors that Chubais' chief ally, Yeltsin's younger daughter<br>
Tatyana Dyachenko, is about to be given an official Kremlin post as<br>
presidential aide. The rumor was given front-page coverage yesterday by the<br>
newspaper Segodnya, which said the Kremlin wanted to place Dyachenko on an<br>
official footing precisely to put an end to press speculation about her<br>
role, which is acknowledged to be crucial. (Segodnya, December 17)<br>
Indicating the sensitivity of the subject, Segodnya's report prompted an<br>
immediate denial from the Kremlin. (Itar-Tass, December 17)<br>
<p>
Other rumors hold that Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov will shortly be<br>
promoted to deputy prime minister, with responsibility for overseeing the<br>
financing and provisioning of the army and the police. Also reported to be<br>
in the running for this new post is Sergei Stepashin, presently on the staff<br>
of the presidential administration and a close ally of Anatoly Chubais.<br>
(Interfax, December 17) According to yet another rumor, a third Communist<br>
will soon join the government. The rumor holds that, as part of the price<br>
for approving the budget last week, the Communists demanded the appointment<br>
of Yuri Maslyukov, former head of USSR Gosplan and now chairman of the<br>
Duma's Economics Committee, to a ministerial post.<br>
<p>
MANAGEMENT OF COAL COMPANIES TO BE PRIVATIZED. On December 9 Russian<br>
president Boris Yeltsin signed a decree that will "transfer on trust" state<br>
shares in 5 coal companies (Bashkirugol, Vostsibugol, Krasnoyarsk Coal<br>
Company, Lenigradslanets, and Kakhasugol). Altogether, the five represent 27<br>
percent of Russian coal production. The transfer of shares on trust confers<br>
managerial control but no property rights. The scheme, which is an attempt<br>
to introduce some competition in the industry, has been discussed recently<br>
with the World Bank. It is hoped that the transfer of managing rights in the<br>
coal industry will reduce dependence on state subsidies, diminish wage and<br>
tax debts, and increase profitability. According to Fuel and Energy Ministry<br>
officials, the managerial abilities of the potential trustees are the main<br>
factor taken into account in the allocation of shares. The newly appointed<br>
managers will have to confer with state authorities on fundamental questions<br>
such as the reorganization and liquidation of enterprises, increases of<br>
chartered capital, and the issuance of securities. The government is<br>
currently reviewing the possibility of increasing the number of companies<br>
included in this program, and it is possible that up to 25 percent of all<br>
Russian coal companies will be directed by managers selected on a<br>
competitive basis by the end of 1997. (Interfax, December 16, Itar-Tass,<br>
December 16) A wave of strikes over wage arrears and accusations of misuse<br>
of a World Bank credits have recently added to the woes of Russia's coal sector.<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN COMPANIES SIGN MODEST OIL DEALS WITH IRAQ. Three Russian oil<br>
companies--LUKoil, Zarubezhneft, and Nafta Moskva -- signed contracts on<br>
December 15 to purchase Iraqi oil, and are awaiting what is expected to be<br>
quick UN approval for the deals. The Russian companies anticipate being able<br>
to begin moving the oil by January 10. In total, the purchases by the<br>
Russian companies will equal about 55,000 barrels per day, which is less<br>
than ten percent of the 600,000 barrels per day that the UN has permitted<br>
Baghdad to sell under a recently concluded "oil for food" deal. With those<br>
figures in mind, a Russian daily complained yesterday that Iraq has turned<br>
to Western companies to export much of its oil, despite the fact that Moscow<br>
had vigorously championed Baghdad's efforts to win a relaxation of<br>
international sanctions. Three other Russian companies -- Rosneft,<br>
Machinoimport, and MES -- are reported to be interested in buying Iraqi oil,<br>
but have not yet signed any contracts with SOMO, the Iraqi state oil trading<br>
agency. (UPI, Reuter, Kommersant-daily, December 17) <br>
<p>
On December 11 a Russian government official had cautioned that Russian<br>
companies might not profit greatly from the "oil-for-food" deal because<br>
non-Russian firms were in a better position to supply Iraq with the<br>
humanitarian goods that Baghdad will be allowed to purchase with its oil<br>
revenues. He suggested that earlier, well-publicized deals between Russian<br>
companies and Iraq were likely in the short term to bring the former only a<br>
"few tens of millions of dollars." (Interfax, December 10)<br>

THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
RUSSIA AVOIDS RECOGNITION OF UKRAINE'S BORDERS. In the midst of a visit to<br>
South Korea, Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma said yesterday that a<br>
possible Russian-Ukrainian conflict over Sevastopol "would be a grave crime<br>
against humanity." Also yesterday, the Russian Foreign Ministry's chief<br>
spokesman, Gennady Tarasov, stated at a briefing that Moscow "cannot<br>
comprehend" a statement from the Ukrainian parliament that rejected Russian<br>
"territorial claims" to Sevastopol. "The official position of Russia's<br>
executive branch is that Sevastopol and Crimea belong to Ukraine," Tarasov<br>
said. In Kiev, however, the Ukrainian General Staff's chief cartographer,<br>
Col. Vyacheslav Zhyhulin, complained that the Russian side is leaving<br>
unanswered Ukraine's repeated proposals to proceed with the delimitation and<br>
demarcation of their mutual, 2,063 kilometer-long border. Romania has<br>
adopted the same attitude, Zhyhulin said. By contrast, Slovakia has<br>
completed, and Poland and Hungary are well on their way toward completing,<br>
the demarcation of their respective borders with Ukraine. In Odessa for<br>
talks with Moldovan officials, Ukrainian deputy foreign minister Konstantin<br>
Hrishchenko (who handles border delimitation and demarcation talks with<br>
Ukraine's neighbors) said that the work on that sector is advancing in "the<br>
most propitious atmosphere." (UNIAN, December 16; Interfax-Ukraine, December 17)<br>
<p>
All of these countries, with the exception of Slovakia, have had historical<br>
and post-World War II border problems with Ukraine. But only Russia and<br>
Romania have questioned independent Ukraine's borders since 1991. Romania's<br>
new, right-of-center president and government signaled last week that they<br>
are prepared to change that position. That would leave Moscow alone in the<br>
position of questioning Ukraine's border.<br>

THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
SHEVARDNADZE APOLOGIZES TO UKRAINE FOR RUSSIAN "PIRACY," BUT PROBLEMS WITH<br>
RUSSIAN BORDER TROOPS MULTIPLY. Georgian president Eduard Shevardnadze told<br>
the country during a radio broadcast that the Russian border troops' recent<br>
seizure of the Ukrainian ship Almaz and its crew in Batumi, Georgia<br>
"amounted to piracy." Shevardnadze apologized to Ukraine in the name of the<br>
Georgian government for the Russian action on Georgian territory. (See<br>
Monitor, Western Region section, December 16) The Georgian parliament's<br>
defense and security commission chairman, Revaz Adamia, and the commander of<br>
Georgian border troops, Maj. Gen. Valeri Chkheidze, stated that the Russian<br>
border troops' action in Batumi has undermined prospects for Georgian<br>
ratification of the 1994 treaty with Russia on "joint protection" of<br>
Georgia's borders. (Radio Tbilisi, December 16; Interfax, December 15-16)<br>
The Russian authorities released the crew and the ship on December 15, after<br>
having detained them incommunicado for 11 days, but the captain is still<br>
being held. <br>
<p>
It appears, moreover, that Tbilisi faces more problems with Russian border<br>
troops. A delegation representing Russia's Stavropol krai arrived yesterday<br>
in Batumi for direct talks on bilateral trade and economic cooperation with<br>
Ajaria, which is a part of Georgia. Strangely, the delegation included Maj.<br>
Gen. Vladimir Gorodinsky, the commander of Russia's Caucasus Special Border<br>
district. (Interfax, December 17) In the Almaz incident, the Russian border<br>
troop command had dealt with the Ajarian authorities behind Tbilisi's back.<br>
The command seems to be engaged in a policy of encouraging the Ajarian<br>
authorities to enter into direct relations with Russia.<br>
<p>
At Georgia's opposite end, in South Ossetia, Russian border troops are<br>
blocking the transit of passengers and goods at the Georgian-Russian border<br>
in either direction. The Georgian side of that sector is "protected jointly"<br>
by Russian and Georgian border guards. The latter are powerless to change<br>
the situation, which Tbilisi considers to be an "economic blockade."<br>
(Iviria, December 12)<br>

ROUTING AZERBAIJANI OIL: CHECHNYA WANTS ITS SHARE "OR ELSE." The Chechen<br>
government demands a share in the project to pump Azerbaijani oil via<br>
Chechnya to the Russian port Novorossiisk, a Chechen government<br>
representative identified as Eduard Hachukaev stated yesterday in Baku. He<br>
said that he had participated in talks with top management of the Azerbaijan<br>
International Operating Company (AIOC), and had notified the consortium that<br>
it "must take Chechnya's interests into account, or else oil will not be<br>
transported on the Baku-Novorossiisk route. Moreover, it will not be<br>
transported through another North Caucasus route either." Hachukaev claimed<br>
that the existing pipeline's stretch through Chechnya is in good condition.<br>
(Turan, December 12)<br>
<p>
Moscow wants a large portion of the oil output from Azerbaijan's "deal of<br>
the century" to be detoured through Russia via the North Caucasus. Although<br>
the AIOC considers that route as one option, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Georgia<br>
favor the shorter and safer export route in the opposite direction. During<br>
the recent war, Chechen leaders had threatened to foil any Russian-AIOC<br>
deal, offering to negotiate with the AIOC themselves for a cut of the<br>
revenue. Moscow now hopes that the end of the war will facilitate the AIOC's<br>
acceptance of the Russian route and induce the Chechens to cooperate in<br>
guaranteeing the pipeline's security. Yesterday's warning undermines that hope.<br>

TURKISH INTEREST IN KAZAKHSTAN REAFFIRMED. Turkish president Suleyman<br>
Demirel yesterday completed a two-day official visit to Kazakhstan on the<br>
fifth anniversary of the country's independence. (See Monitor, December 17)<br>
Demirel agreed to open a Turkish credit line of $300 million, on top of the<br>
$1.2 billion already invested by mostly small- and medium-size Turkish firms<br>
in Kazakhstan. He also cut the ribbon of a Turkish bank and a Turkish-funded<br>
college in Almaty, and discussed with President Nursultan Nazarbaev the<br>
participation of Turkish companies in building up Kazakhstan's new capital<br>
city Akmola. Nazarbaev expressed the wish that the largest Turkish firms<br>
also invest in Kazakhstan. He praised Turkey for "standing by Kazakhstan at<br>
every step of its development as an independent state." Approximately 2,000<br>
young Kazakhs are studying in Turkey. The two presidents termed their<br>
peoples "fraternal" on the strength of their common Turkic origins.<br>
