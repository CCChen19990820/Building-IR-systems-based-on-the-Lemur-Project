<P>Defendant Timothy McVeigh has filed this March 7, 1996 memo with the court on the Classified Information Procedures Act.</P>
<HR WIDTH=525 ALIGN=LEFT>
<PRE>
IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE 
DISTRICT OF COLORADO  
 
Criminal No. 96-CR-68-M (formerly No. CR-95-110-MH WDOK)  
 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
 
Plaintiff, 
 
v. 
 
TIMOTHY JAMES McVEIGH and TERRY LYNN NICHOLS,  
 
Defendants. 
 
DEFENDANT McVEIGH'S MEMORANDUM TO THE COURT 
CONCERNING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CLASSIFIED 
INFORMATION PROCEDURES ACT  
 
Defendant Timothy McVeigh submits this Memorandum to the 
Court as a succinct guide and overview of the procedures and 
protocol under the Classified Information Procedures Act, 18 
U.S.C. App. III. Sections 1-16 ("CIPA").  
 
I. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE OF THE ACT 
 
The primary purpose of CIPA is to limit the practice of "gray mail" 
by criminal defendants. Gray mail refers simply to the threat by a 
criminal defendant to disclose classified information during the 
course of a trial. See Legislative History of Act, 1980 U.S. Code 
Cong. & Admin. News 4294, 4295. The gray mailing defendant 
essentially presented the government with a "Hobson's choice": 
either allowed disclosure of the classified information or dismiss 
the indictment. See United States v. Baptista-Rodriguez, 17 F.3d 
1354, 1363 (11th Cir. 1994).  
 
The Hobson's choice was present prior to CIPA because the issue 
of admissibility of the information occurred during the trial itself 
and was usually made a public record during the arguments on its 
admissibility. The procedural protections of CIPA protect 
unnecessary disclosure of classified information. But CIPA does 
not restrict admissibility of classified information; rather, it simply 
enables the government to ascertain prior to trial the specific 
classified information which the defendant possesses, or seeks to 
admit at trial, so that the government can evaluate the effect of 
disclosure on national security. See United States v. Pringle, 751 
F.2d 419, 427 (1st Cir. 1984).  
 
Thus, CIPA "is not intended to infringe on a defendant's right to a 
fair trial or to change the existing rules of evidence in criminal 
procedure." H.R. Rep. No. 831, 96th Cong., 2nd Session, pt. 2, at 3 
1980 [cited in Richard P. Salgado, Government Secrets, Fair 
Trials, And The Classified Information Procedures Act, 98 Yale 
Law Journal 427, 431 (1988)]. In the language of the Eleventh 
Circuit, the procedures simply aid in informing the government of 
"the 'price the defendant asserts the government will have to pay if 
the prosecution continues." Unite States v. Collins, 720 F.2d 1195, 
1197 (11th Cir. 1983).  
 
Finally, it is explicitly recognized in the legislative history that the 
practice of gray mail is not limited to unscrupulous or questionable 
conduct by defendants, since wholly proper defense attempts to 
obtain or disclose classified information may present the 
government with the same "disclose or dismiss" dilemma. See 
1980 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News, 4296-97. CIPA is merely 
a procedural tool requiring a pre-trial court ruling on the 
admissibility of classified information. United States v. Smith, 780 
F.2d 1102, 1106 (4th Cir. 1985) (en banc).  
 
II. PROCEDURES 
 
1. Information Must Be Classified: CIPA only applies when 
classified information is involved. See United States v. Panas, 738 
F.2d 278, 285-86 (8th Cir. 1984) (information at issue was never 
classified, so CIPA does not apply); CIPA Section 1 (classified 
information defined). Since 1940, the primary method of 
classifying information has been through Executive Order. Brian 
Z. Tamanaha, A Critical Review Of 7he Classified Information 
Procedures Act, 13 Am. J. Cr. L. 277, 284 (1986). President 
Reagan promulgated the current Executive Order on classified 
information in mid-1982. See Executive Order No. 12,356, 3 
C.F.R. 166-67 (1982), reprinted in 50 U.S.C. Section 401 (1982). 
President Reagan's order specifies which members of the executive 
branch are authorized to classify information. There are currently 
three levels of classification:  
 
a) "top secret" meaning information, the unauthorized disclosure of 
which reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave 
damage to the national security;  
 
b) "secret" meaning information, the unauthorized disclosure of 
which reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the 
national security; and  
 
c) "confidential" information, the unauthorized disclosure of which 
reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national 
security.  
 
2. Discovery of Classified Information: In order to prevail on a 
discovery request for classified information pursuant to Rule 16 or 
Brady, a defendant must cross the "low hurdle" showing that the 
requested material is relevant to his case. United States v. Yunis, 
924 F.2d 1086, 1095 (D.C. Cir. 1991). If this "low hurdle" is 
successfully jumped, the court must determine whether 
government has asserted a "colorable" claim of privilege. Id. If the 
government has asserted such a claim, the defendant must show 
that the information would be helpful to his defense. Id.  
 
Should the government submit classified (or unclassified) 
documents to the district court in camera ex parte in order to 
establish that the documents are not material to the defense, then it 
is entirely appropriate for the district court to allow the Defendant 
to submit in camera ex pane an affidavit setting out in detail why 
the requested information is material to preparation of the defense. 
United States v. Clegg, 740 F.2d 16, 17 (9th Cir. 1984); see also 
United States v. Poindexter, 698 F. Supp. 316, 321 (D.D.C. 1988) 
("The court will hear counsel for Defendant North at what may 
prove to be more than a single in camera, ex parte oral 
presentation... for the sole... purpose of being informed without 
disclosure to independent counsel, of the reasons why he and his 
counsel consider the specific items of classified information he is 
seeking... as relevant and material to his defense").  
 
 
Note: There is a split of authority concerning the issue of whether 
an additional balancing test is required when dealing with 
discovery and/or admissibility of classified information. The issue 
is whether otherwise relevant information which happens to be 
classified may be non-discoverable or inadmissible because of its 
classified nature.1 As to discovery and admissibility of classified 
information, some courts have endorsed a balancing approach. See, 
e.g., United States v. Sarkissian, 841 F.2d 959, 965 (9th Cir. 1988).  
 
Some courts have rejected a balancing approach and have instead 
applied the general rules of admissibility under Rules 401-403. 
See, e. g., United States v. Cardoen, 898 F. Supp. 1563 (S.D. Fla. 
1995). Other courts have declined to take position. See, e.g., 
United States v. Yunis, 924 F.2d 1086, 1095 (D.C. Cir. 1991).  
 
The issue is well-illustrated in a sharply divided en banc decision 
from the Fourth Circuit. In a pre-trial hearing pursuant to CIPA 
concerning the admissibility of classified information, the en banc 
Fourth Circuit split 6-5 in holding that the defendant's right to 
prepare his defense had to be balanced against the public interest in 
preventing the disclosure of classified information, as under 
Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53 (1957) (recognizing a 
government privilege to protect informants). United States v. 
Smith, 780 F.2d 1102, 1105 (4th Cir. 1985) (en banc). The Fourth 
Circuit declined to establish a "rigid rule" for the proper balance, 
stating that it would vary from case to case depending upon the 
crime charged, how essential the information was to the defense, 
and whether the information was merely cumulative or 
corroborative. Id. at 1110. The Fourth Circuit held specifically that 
the standard of admissibility for classified information "is at least 
more restrictive than the ordinary rules of relevancy would 
indicate." Id.  
 
 
The dissenters in Smith, as well as the commentators, criticized the 
majority for ignoring the fact that Congress specifically rejected a 
bill that suggested the balancing approach of Roviaro. See Richard 
P. Salgado, Government Secrets, Fair Trials, And The Classified 
Information Procedures Act, 98 Yale Law Journal 427, 441 (1988). 
The courts are split on the issue of a Roviaro balancing in a CIPA 
Section 6(a) relevancy hearing. Compare United States v. Zenttl, 
835 F.2d 1059 (4th Cir. 1987) (balancing appropriate) and United 
States v. Smith, 780 F. 2d 1102 (4th Cir. 1985) (en banc) (same) 
with United States v. Juan, 776 F.2d 256 (11th Cir. 1985) 
(balancing inappropriate).  
 
3. Protective Orders: If classified information is ruled discoverable, 
the government make invoke Sections 3 and 4 of CIPA. Section 3 
provides that upon motion of the United States, the court shall 
issue a protective order against disclosure of any classified 
information disclosed by the government to the defendant. In 
addition, section 4 allows the court, upon a "sufficient showing" to 
authorize the government to delete specified items of classified 
information from documents made discoverable, to substitute 
summaries of information, or to substitute a statement admitting 
relevant facts that the classified information would tend to prove.  
 
Motions by the government pursuant to Section 4 may be filed in 
camera and under seal, but may not be filed ex parte. United Stales 
v. Rezaq, 156 F.R.D. 514, 526 (D.D.C. 1994). Because of the 
adversarial nature of the proceedings, defense counsel should be 
entitled to inspect the government's submissions. Id. Thus, upon 
reviewing the government's submissions, defense counsel may file, 
in camera and under seal, appropriate arguments that the 
government's submissions do not establish a facial claim of 
privilege, or that they contain evidence material to the defense, and 
thus may be disclosed even if classified. Id. Whether or not the 
government's submissions are ex parte is within the discretion of 
the court since section 4 states that the court "may" permit such ex 
parte filings. However, as the court in Rezaq stated, such parte 
filings are not required nor even favored. Id.  
 
4. Notice By the Defendant: If classified information is provided to 
a defendant, and a defendant reasonably expects to disclose 
classified information at trial (or pre-trial proceedings), the 
defendant must notify the government and the court in writing of 
his intention. Notice must be given within the time specified by the 
court or, if no time is specified, within 30 days prior to trial. CIPA 
Section 5(a). The notice must specifically set out the classified 
information the defendant believes he will rely upon in his defense. 
Id.; United States v. Smith, 780 F.2d 1102, 1105 (4th Cir. 1985) 
(en banc). Failure of the defendant to file a proper notice may 
result in a court order precluding disclosure of classified 
information. It may also prohibit the examination of a witness 
concerning such information. Id. Section 5(b).  
 
5. Hearing on "use, relevance or admissibility": Once a defendant 
has given notice of intent to introduce classified information at 
trial, the government may request a pre- trial hearing at which the 
court shall determine the "use, relevance or admissibility" of 
classified information that would otherwise be made during the 
trial or pre-trial proceeding." CIPA Section 6. This hearing shall be 
held in camera if the Attorney General certifies to the court that a 
public proceeding may result in the disclosure of classified 
information. CIPA Section 6(a).  
 
Section 6(b)(1) provides that before such a hearing is conducted 
pursuant to a request by the government, the government must 
provide the defendant with notice of the classified information at 
issue. The government's notice must identify the specific classified 
information at issue whenever that information previously has been 
made available to the defendant. However, if the government has 
not previously made the information available to the defendant in 
connection with the case, the information may be described by 
generic category, and in such form as the court may approve, rather 
than by identification of the specific information.  
 
Finally, when the government requests a Section 6(a) hearing, the 
court, upon request of the defendant, may order the government to 
provide the defendant prior to trial "such details as to the portion of 
the indictment or information at issue in the hearing as are needed 
to give the defendant fair notice to prepare for the hearing." CIPA 
Section 6(b)(2).  
 
 
Note: As discussed previously, the standard of admissibility of 
classified information is unclear and the circuits are split. The 
legislative history and the cases interpreting  6 of CIPA emphasize 
that CIPA did not alter the existing standards for determining 
relevancy or admissibility. In fact, Congress explicitly rejected a 
Department of Justice suggestion that a more restrictive standard of 
relevance and admissibility should be included under CIPA. See 
1980 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News at 4301-02; United States 
v. Smith, 780 F.2d 1102, 1111-13 (4th Cir. 1980) (en banc) 
(Butzner, J. dissenting).  
 
The circuits are split as to the appropriate standard of admissibility. 
Courts applying the Roviaro balancing test point out that Roviaro 
was decided prior to CIPA and was thus an existing standard which 
CIPA was not meant to change. See Smith, supra, at 1110. In 
contrast, other courts have held that admissibility of classified 
information is determined the same as any other potential evidence 
in a criminal case pursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence 401-403. 
See, e.g., United States v. Juan, 776 F.2d 256, 258 (11th Cir. 1985) 
(the district court may not take into account the fact that evidence 
is classified when determining its "use, relevance or 
admissibility.N); United States v. Wilson, 586 F. Supp. 1011, 1013 
(S.D.N.Y. 1983) (in making its rulings on admissibility, the court 
is to disregard the fact that certain material may be classified).  
 
 
6. Alternatives to Disclosure: If the court determines that classified 
information is admissible and relevant, then the government may 
move for an order allowing, in lieu of disclosure, either a 
substitution of a statement admitting relevant facts that the 
classified information would- tend to prove, or a substitution of a 
summary of the specific classified information. CIPA Section 6(c). 
The court is required to grant such a motion if it finds that the 
statement or summary will provide the defendant "with 
substantially the same ability to make his defense as would 
disclosure of the specified classified information." The court is also 
required to hold a hearing on the government's motion to substitute 
and any such hearing must be in camera at the request of the 
Attorney General.  
 
The government may also elect, in conjunction with its request for 
substitution, to submit to the court in camera and ex parte an 
affidavit of the Attorney General certifying that the disclosure of 
classified information would cause identifiable damage to the 
national security and explaining the basis for the classification of 
the information. CIPA Section 6(c)(2). The apparent basis for the 
affidavit is to provide the court with knowledge of the reasons for 
the classification of the materials in order for the court to be able to 
determine relevance, or to create fair substitutions and/or 
stipulations. See Salgado, supra, at 438.  
 
7. Sealed Proceedings and Reconsideration: All in camera 
proceedings and hearings pursuant to CIPA shall be sealed and 
preserved for the appellate record. CIPA Section 6(d). Also, a 
defendant may seek reconsideration of a court's determination prior 
to or during trial. This provision allows flexibility to revisit pre-
trial rulings which are based solely on attorney representations and 
which may be contradicted or otherwise affected by information at 
trial.  
 
8. Effect of Disclosure: Section 6(e)(1) provides that if the court 
ultimately denies the government's motion for substitutions, the 
government may nevertheless continue to object and refuse to 
release the classified information at issue. Such an objection must 
be made by an affidavit of the Attorney General, and the court 
must order that the defendant not disclose or cause the disclosure 
of the classified information.  In the event that the government 
refuses to disclose classified information, and a defendant is 
prevented from disclosing or causing the disclosure of classified 
information, the court shall dismiss the indictment or information. 
CIPA Section 6(e)(2).  
 
However, the presumption for dismissal may be overcome by the 
government if it convinces the court that the interest of justice 
would not be served by dismissal. Other appropriate actions short 
of dismissing the indictment may include (but are not limited to) 
dismissing specified counts, finding against the government on any 
issue as to which the classified information relates, or striking or 
precluding all or part of the testimony of a witness.  
 
9. Reciprocity: Section 6(f) provides that whenever the court rules 
that a defendant may use classified information after a Section 6(a) 
hearing, the government must provide the defendant with the 
information it expects to use to rebut such information. This 
"reciprocity" provision was enacted in the interest of fairness and 
to balance the notice obligations imposed by the defendant under 
Section 5. See 1980 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News at 4303.  If 
the government fails to provide the defendant with the information 
it expects to use to rebut the classified information, then the court 
may, similar to the penalty facing a defendant under Section 5, 
preclude the use of any rebuttal information the government fails 
to properly notice.  
 
10. Interlocutory Appeal: The government may take an 
interlocutory appeal either before or after the defendant has been 
placed in jeopardy from a decision or order of a district court in a 
criminal case authorizing the disclosure of classified information, 
imposing sanctions for non-disclosure, or refusing a protective 
order sought by the government to prevent disclosure of classified 
information. Section 7(a). Appeals under this section are expedited 
by the courts of appeals. Section 7(b). If an appeal is taken prior to 
trial, the appeal must be lodged within ten (10) days after the 
decision or order appealed from and the trial will be stayed until 
the appeal is resolved.  
 
If an appeal is taken during trial, the trial shall be adjourned until 
the appeal is resolved and the Court of Appeals (1) shall hear the 
argument on such appeal within four (4) days of the adjournment 
of trial, (2) may dispense with written briefs other than the 
supporting materials previously submitted to the trial court, (3) 
shall render its decision within four (4) days of argument on 
appeal, and (4) may dispense with the issuance of a written opinion 
in rendering its decision. An appeal in this fashion does not 
compromise the right of the defendant, in a subsequent appeal from 
a judgment of conviction, to claim reversible error by the trial 
court on remand of a ruling appealed from during trial.  
 
11. Handling Classified Information: CIPA Section 8 contains 
three (3) provisions governing the actual handling of classified 
information at trial. Under Section 8(a), classified information may 
be admitted into evidence without a change in its classification 
status. Thus, this subsection simply recognizes that classification is 
an Executive and not a judicial function. See 1980 U.S. Code 
Cong. & Admin. News at 4304.  
 
Section 8(b) allows the Court to admit into evidence only portions 
of a writing. recording, or photograph, or, alternatively, to admit 
the entire evidence with redactions, unless fairness requires 
otherwise. The purpose of the rule is to prevent unnecessary 
disclosure of classified information by allowing the deletion of 
irrelevant sensitive information from materials admitted into 
evidence.  
 
Subsection 8(c) allows the government to object to an inquiry of a 
witness which may require a response disclosing classified 
information not previously found admissible pursuant to a Section 
6 proceeding. The Court must then take appropriate action to guard 
against such disclosures, including but not limited to requiring a 
proffer from each side on the evidence that will be elicited.  
 
12. Security Procedures:     This section directs the Chief Justice of 
the United States to draft and implement procedures designed to 
protect classified information in the physical custody of district 
courts, courts of appeals or the United States Supreme Court. Chief 
Justice Warren Burger issued guidelines February 12, 1981, and 
they are located following Section 9 of the Act.  
 
III. SUMMARY OUTLINE OF PROCEDURES 
 
1. Is the information classified pursuant to Executive Order?  
 
2. Is the classified information discoverable, i.e., is it relevant to 
the Defendant's case?  
 
3. Has the government asserted a colorable claim of privilege?  
 
4. If so, is the information helpful to the defense?  
 
5. Has the government submitted in camera ex parte classified (or 
unclassified) material and argument that the requested information 
is not relevant and therefore not discoverable?  
 
6. Has the defense submitted an ex parte in camera affidavit 
explaining why the requested information is relevant to the 
preparation of a defense?  
 
7. [In some circuits] Does the Defendant's need for the information 
outweigh the government's asserted interest in keeping the 
information secret?  
 
8. If the information is discoverable, has the government moved 
for a protective order pursuant to  3?  
 
9. Has the government invoked Section 4 by making a "sufficient 
showing" to the court for authorization to:  
 
a) delete specified items of classified information from documents 
made available to the defendant;  
 
b) substitute a summary of the information for such classified 
documents; or  
 
c) substitute a statement admitting relevant facts that the classified 
information would tend to prove.  
 
10. Has the Defendant properly and timely served notice pursuant 
to Section 5 of intent to use classified information in court 
proceedings?  
 
11. Has the government requested a pre-trial hearing pursuant to 
Section 6 in order to determine the "use, relevance or 
admissibility" of classified information?  
 
12. Has the government given the Defendant proper notice of the 
classified information at issue pursuant to Section 6(b)(1)?  
 
13. Has the Defendant requested an order to make the government 
provide details as to the portion of the indictment or information at 
issue in the Section 6(a) hearing as are needed to give the 
Defendant fair notice to prepare for the hearing?  
 
14. If classified information is relevant and admissible, has the 
government moved for either:  
 
a) substitution of a statement admitting relevant facts that the 
classified information would tend to prove; or  
 
b) substitution of a summary of the specific classified information 
pursuant to Section 6(c)?  
 
15. If the court orders disclosure of classified information, has the 
Attorney General filed an affidavit objecting to such disclosure 
pursuant to Section 6(e)(1)?  
 
16. If the Defendant is prevented from disclosing classified 
information deemed relevant and admissible, should the court:  
 
a) dismiss the indictment; 
 
b) dismiss certain counts; 
 
c) making findings against the government;  
 
d) strike or preclude certain witnesses; or  
 
e) take other appropriate action? 
 
17. Is there an interlocutory appeal from:  
 
a) an order of disclosure; 
 
b) an order imposing sanctions for non-disclosure; or  
 
c) refusal of the Defendant to comply with the protective order?  
 
IV. CONCLUSION 
 
The foregoing is meant as an aid to the Court and counsel in 
preparing to deal with the potential presence of classified 
information in this case.

ENDNOTE 
 
 
1.  Although a court may take into account the government's 
interest in protecting national security, this interest cannot override 
a defendant's right to a fair trial. United States v. Fernandez, 913 
F.2d 148, 154 (4th Cir. 1990). Thus, classified information must 
nevertheless be adrnitted if it is "helpful to the defense of an 
accused, or is essential to a fair determination of a cause." Id.

MOTION OF THE UNITED STATES IN LIMINE REGARDING 
STATEMENTS OF TERRY NICHOLS  
 
Supreme Court case law favors pretrial resolution of the 
admissibility of a codefendant's statement.  Richardson v. Marsh, 
481 U.S. 200, 209  (1987)  (court should be able "to predict the 
admissibility of [a codefendant's statement] in advance of trial"). A 
motion in limine is the procedural device for pretrial resolution of 
evidentiary issues (Luce v. United States, 469 U.S. 38, 41 n.4 
(1984)), including those filed by the government seeking 
admission of evidence.  United States v. Kimball, 73 F.3d 269, 271 
n.1 (10th Cir. 1995); United States v. Shaw, 69 F.3d 1249, 1252  
(4th Cir. 1995); United States v. Pulido,  69 F.3d 192,  198-202  
(7th Cir. 1995); United States v. Davis, 826 F. Supp. 617, 620 
(D.R.I. 1993).  
 
Accordingly, the United States moves pretrial for a ruling on the 
admissibility of certain statements that defendant Nichols made to 
FBI agents two days after the Oklahoma City bombing.   The 
particular statements at issue are Nichols' admissions to the FBI 
that he:  (1) drove McVeigh from Oklahoma City to Kansas on 
April 16; (2) met again with McVeigh on the morning of April 18; 
and (3) cleaned out a storage locker for McVeigh on April 20.  
 
Because the admissibility of these statements affects the manner in 
which the prosecution prepares its case, the government makes this 
request well in advance of trial.  Such a ruling, of course, will not 
resolve all issues concerning Nichols' statement. Nor will it 
preempt defendants'  anticipated severance motions, although it 
may help narrow the focus of those motions.

BRIEF OF THE UNITED STATES IN SUPPORT OF MOTION 
IN LIMINE REGARDING TERRY NICHOLS' STATEMENTS  
 
BACKGROUND 
 
On April 21, 1995, after hearing that Timothy McVeigh had been 
arrested in connection with the Oklahoma City bombing,  Terry 
Nichols voluntarily appeared at the Herington, Kansas Department 
of Public Safety, where the FBI interviewed him.  Nichols' 
statements include those describing his facially innocent acts with 
or on behalf of McVeigh in the days surrounding the bombing.  
Although they mention McVeigh, these statements are 
incriminating only in light of other evidence in this case.    As 
these statements are critical to the manner in which the prosecution 
prepares its case, their admissibility should be resolved well in 
advance of trial.1  
 
Nichols' statements of his activities with or on behalf of McVeigh 
during the critical days fall into three categories:  
 
A.  Driving McVeigh From Oklahoma City To Kansas On April 
16.  
 
Nichols admitted that, on April 16, 1995 (Easter Sunday), he drove 
to Oklahoma City, "went past that [Murrah] building a couple of 
times" looking for McVeigh, spotted McVeigh down an alley and 
picked him up, and drove him back to Kansas.  Nichols denied that 
his Oklahoma City trip had anything to do with bomb preparations, 
and claimed instead that McVeigh had called him after McVeigh's 
car had broken down in Oklahoma City while en route from 
Arizona with Nichols' television set.  Nichols claimed that 
McVeigh told him he would have to pick up McVeigh in 
Oklahoma City if he wanted the TV. Nichols admitted that he lied 
to his wife Marife by telling her that he was picking up McVeigh 
in Omaha, Nebraska.  Nichols claimed that he left Kansas to pick 
up McVeigh shortly after 3:00 p.m. on April 16, that he dropped 
off McVeigh near a closed Junction City McDonald's at 1:30 a.m. 
on April 17, and that he arrived back home in Herington about 2:00 
a.m.  
 
B.  Allowing McVeigh To Use A Truck On April 18.  
 
Nichols claimed that his next contact with McVeigh occurred on 
April 18, 1995, when McVeigh called asking to borrow his truck. 
Nichols told the FBI that at around 7:30 a.m. on April 18, he 
picked up McVeigh at the same Junction City McDonald's where 
they had parted ways two nights earlier and lent McVeigh his 
truck. Nichols purportedly attended a Fort Riley military auction 
until the afternoon of April 18 when McVeigh returned with his 
truck.  
 
C.  Cleaning Out The Locker For McVeigh On April 20.  
 
Nichols told the FBI that, on April 20, 1995 (the day after the 
bombing), he removed McVeigh's sleeping bag, rucksack and rifle 
from a Herington storage facility. Nichols claimed that he did so 
pursuant to McVeigh's April 18th directive that "if I don't pick [up 
those belongings], pick them up for me.  
 
II.  ARGUMENT 
 
NICHOLS' STATEMENTS ABOUT HIS ACTIVITIES WITH 
OR FOR MCVEIGH IN THE DAYS SURROUNDING THE 
BOMBING ARE ADMISSIBLE IN A JOINT TRIAL.  
 
A.  Nichols' Statements Are Admissible Against Both Defendants 
As Declarations Against Interest.  
 
Nichols' statements are admissible not just against him but also 
against McVeigh as declarations against interest under Fed. R. 
Evid. 804(b)(3).  The first prerequisite under Rule 804(b)(3) is that 
the "declarant is unavailable as a witness," something that clearly 
is the case here because Nichols has a Fifth Amendment right not 
to testify at trial.   See Fed.  R.  Evid.  804(a)(1) (defining 
"unavailability"  to  include witnesses  exempted  from testifying 
on ground of privilege).   The question then becomes whether, in 
the words of Rule 804(b)(3), Nichols' statements "so far tended to 
subject the declarant to ... criminal liability, ... that a reasonable 
person in the declarant's position would not have made the 
statement unless believing it to be true."  See Williamson v. United 
States, 114 S. Ct. 2431, 2435 (1994)  ("Rule 804(b)(3) is founded 
on the commonsense notion that reasonable people, even 
reasonable people who are not especially honest, tend not to make 
self-inculpatory statements unless they believe them to be true"). A 
trial court evaluating Rule 804(b)(3) must parse the overall 
interview and make a statement-by-statement determination "in 
light of all the surrounding circumstances."  Id. at 2435-2437.  
 
For purposes of Williamson, the key circumstance surrounding the 
April 21, 1995 interview is that Nichols admitted he was aware 
McVeigh had just been arrested for the Oklahoma City bombing. 
Indeed, although we will not seek to introduce it at trial  (see supra 
note 1), a key statement in the Rule 804(b)(3) analysis is Nichols' 
admission  that  he  himself  "suspect[ed]"  McVeigh was involved 
in the bombing.  A reasonable person in Nichols' shoes would not 
make statements linking himself to McVeigh, or to the city of the 
bombing, unless he in fact believed they were true. Nichols, 
however, linked himself to McVeigh in three critical ways during 
the days just before and after the bombing:  1) he admitted driving 
to Oklahoma City, meeting McVeigh, and driving back with him 
on April 16,  1995;  2)  he admitted being with McVeigh and 
lending him his pickup truck in Kansas on April 18, 1995; and 3) 
he admitted cleaning out a storage locker for McVeigh on April 20, 
1995.   Once having admitted involvement with McVeigh on these 
critical days, the fact that Nichols may have been motivated to 
falsely explain it away does not undercut the inherent reliability of 
his core admissions.  See Williamson, 114 S. Ct. at 2435 ("One of 
the most effective ways to lie is to mix falsehood with truth, 
especially truth that seems particularly persuasive because of its 
self-inculpatory nature").  
 
Even though Nichols'  statements mention McVeigh as well, 
"[t]here are many circumstances in which Rule 804(b)(3) does 
allow the admission of statements that inculpate a  [fellow]  
criminal defendant."  Williamson, 114 S. Ct. at 2436; accord id. at 
2438 (Scalia, J., concurring) ("a declarant's statement is not 
magically transformed from a statement against penal interest into 
one that is inadmissible merely because the declarant names 
another person or implicates a possible codefendant").  An 
example given by the Supreme Court comes remarkably close to 
the present case:   The statement "'Sam and I went to Joe's house' 
might be against the declarant's interest if a reasonable person in 
the declarant's shoes  would realize  that  being  linked  to Joe  and  
Sam would implicate the declarant in Joe and Sam's conspiracy."  
Id. at 2437.  
 
There are present here none of the factors cited in Williamson and 
other cases that might undercut admissions to authorities. Most 
important, Nichols was not a defendant "caught red-handed" who 
was "striving mightily to shift principal responsibility to someone 
else."    Williamson, 114  S.  Ct.  at  2439-2440  (Ginsburg,  J., 
concurring in part and in judgment); cf. Lee v. Illinois, 476 U.S. 
530, 544  (1986)  (defendant may have been motivated "either to 
mitigate the appearance of his own culpability by spreading the 
blame or to overstate Lee's involvement in retaliation for her 
having  implicated him in the murders").   On the contrary,  a 
reasonable person in Nichols' shoes would not make up stories 
about traveling to Oklahoma City to meet the suspected bomber 
three days before the bombing, about lending the suspected 
bomber his truck the day before the bombing, and about cleaning 
out a storage locker for the suspected bomber the day after the 
bombing.  
 
Because Nichols'  core  statements  qualify as declarations against 
interest, their admission also satisfies the Confrontation Clause.  
The Sixth Amendment, which requires that hearsay evidence 
"bear[] adequate 'indicia of reliability,'" can be satisfied in one of 
two ways.   Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56,  66  (1980).   First, 
"[r]eliability can be inferred without more in a case where the 
evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception."   Id. E.q.,  
White v.  Illinois,  502 U.S. 346,  355-356  & n.8  (1992). 
Alternatively, the Sixth Amendment is satisfied by "a showing of 
particularized guarantees of trustworthiness."  Roberts, 448 U.S. at 
66. Both these Sixth Amendment alternatives are satisfied here.  
 
The Tenth Circuit, like most federal courts to have considered the 
issue, holds the declaration against penal interest hearsay exception 
a "firmly rooted" one that satisfies the Sixth Amendment. Jennings 
v. Maynard,  946 F.2d 1502, 1505-1506 (10th Cir. 1991). Accord 
United States v. Saccoccia, 58 F.3d 754, 779 (1st Cir. 1995) 
(hearsay exception "for declarations against penal interest [is] 
firmly rooted in our jurisprudence"); United States v. York, 933 
F.2d 1343, 1363-1364 & n.5 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 916 
(1991)  (similar).   Although Jennings involved an Oklahoma state 
hearsay exception, the Tenth Circuit emphasized that the state rule 
was virtually identical to Federal Rule 804(b)(3).  See 946 F.2d at 
1505, 1506.  Thus, the Tenth Circuit is among those courts that 
hold  Rule  804(b)(3)  to  be  "firmly  rooted"  for purposes  of 
satisfying the Sixth Amendment.  See United States v. Dean, 59 
F.3d 1479,  1493  (5th Cir.  1995) ("many courts have held that 
Rule 804(b)(3) is a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule"; 
citing Tenth Circuit's Jennings opinion and other federal 
decisions), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 748 (1996).  
 
Even if Rule 804(b)(3) were not firmly established, the Sixth 
Amendment would be satisfied because Nichols' core statements 
bear "particularized guarantees of trustworthiness."  The Supreme 
Court has explained that "[t]o be admissible under the 
Confrontation Clause, hearsay evidence used to convict a 
defendant must possess indicia of reliability by virtue of its 
inherent trustworthiness, not by reference to other evidence at 
trial."  Idaho v. Wright, 497 U.S.  805,  822  (1990).    Stated  
otherwise, the  circumstances surrounding the statement must 
provide some "basis for supposing that the declarant is particularly 
likely to be telling the truth." Id.   Justice O'Connor's pivotal 
opinion in Williamson explained that "the very fact that a 
statement is genuinely self-inculpatory -- which our reading of 
Rule 804(b)(3) requires -- is itself one of the  'particularized 
guarantees of trustworthiness'  that make a statement admissible 
under the Confrontation Clause."  114 S. Ct. at 2437.  The same 
reason that supports admissibility of Nichols' statements under 
Rule 804(b)(3) thus supports their admissibility under the Sixth 
Amendment:  there is a strong basis for believing that someone 
would not make up or exaggerate (although he might falsely deny 
or minimize) contacts with the suspected bomber in the days 
immediately before and after the bombing.  
 
B.  Nichols' Statements Are Not Governed BY Bruton Because 
They Are Not On Their Face A "Devastating Confession" That Is 
"Powerfully Incriminating" To McVeigh.  
 
The "preference in the federal system for joint trials of defendants 
who are indicted together" (Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534, 
113 S. Ct. 933,  937 (1993)) remains even though "[i]n most joint 
trials,  ...  some evidence is admitted against some codefendants 
that is not admissible against others."  United States v. Lane, 883 
F.2d 1484, 1498 (10th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S.  1059 
(1990).   As  this  Court knows,  such evidence  often includes 
"out-of-court statements by [a] codefendant" that are not 
admissible against other defendants.   Id.  at 1499.   Bruton v. 
United States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968), carved out a "narrow 
exception" to "the almost invariable assumption" that limiting 
instructions suffice in such cases.  Richardson, 481 U.S. at 206-
207.  There is no Bruton issue, however, as to statements that are 
admissible not just against Nichols but also against McVeigh under 
Rule 804(b)(3). United States v. Cox, 449 F.2d 679, 689 (10th Cir. 
1971)  ("Bruton doctrine does not rule situations like the present 
one in which the evidence is admissible under a well recognized 
exception to the hearsay rule"), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 934 (1972) 
.2  
 
Even if Nichols' statements were inadmissible against McVeigh, 
Bruton still would not apply.   Bruton held that "a defendant is 
deprived of his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation when the 
facially incriminating confession of a nontestifying codefendant is 
introduced at their joint trial, even if the jury is instructed to 
consider the confession only against the codefendant." Richardson, 
481 U.S. at 207.   The codefendant's out-of-court statements in 
Bruton had such a "powerful" and "devastating" effect because 
they directly and unequivocally linked the defendant to the crime:  
"A postal inspector  testified  that   [codefendant]  Evans  orally 
confessed to him that Evans and [defendant Bruton] committed the 
armed robbery."  Id. at 124.  Although full-blown confessions of 
this  type were too  "powerful" and  "devastating"  for  limiting 
instructions, the Bruton Court carefully limited the scope of its 
holding:   "Not every admission of inadmissible hearsay or other 
evidence can be considered to be reversible error unavoidable 
through limiting instructions."  Id. at 135.  
 
Consistent with the facts and rationale of Bruton. the Tenth Circuit  
has  been  careful  to  "limit[]  Bruton applications  to 'clearly 
inculpatory' comments that are 'vitally important to the 
government's case.'"   United States v. Hill,  901 F.2d 880,  884 
(10th Cir. 1990) (citing United States v. Espinosa, 771 F.2d 1382, 
1399 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1023 (1985)).  Whether in 
fact a statement is "clearly inculpatory" must be determined from 
the  face  of  the  statement  without reference  to  other  trial 
evidence.  See Richardson, 481 U.S. at 208-209 (Bruton is "limited 
to facially incriminating confessions"); id. at 211 ("the precise facts 
of Bruton involv[ed] a facially incriminating confession" and "we 
decline to extend it further").   In short, Bruton does not apply 
where the admitted statement "was not incriminating on its face, 
and became so only when linked with evidence introduced later at 
trial...."  Id. at 208.  
 
Nichols' statements detailing his actions with or on behalf of 
McVeigh from April 16-20 are not facially incriminating but 
instead become so only when considered with other evidence to be 
introduced at trial.   For example, Nichols' admitted meeting of 
McVeigh in Oklahoma City on April 16 (for an ostensibly 
legitimate purpose) is not  powerfully  incriminating  "on  its  
face";  to the contrary, thousands of innocent persons traveled to 
downtown Oklahoma City in the vicinity of the Murrah Building 
during the days preceding the bombing.  Likewise, there is nothing 
"facially incriminating" in Nichols' statements about lending his 
truck to McVeigh on April 18 and about cleaning out the storage 
locker on April 20.  All these statements become incriminating 
when "linked" with independent evidence of McVeigh's and 
Nichols' roles in the bombing, but that is not enough to fall within 
"the narrow [Bruton]  exception." Richardson,  481 U.S.  at 208 & 
n.3; see also United States v. Chatman,  994 F.2d 1510, 1513 (10th 
Cir.)  (Bruton does not apply where  the codefendant's  statements  
provide  only  "inferential incrimination" of the defendant),  cert. 
denied,  114 S. Ct.  230 (1993).  
 
Case law makes clear that the facial incrimination requirement 
applies where the admitted statement refers to another defendant 
by name.  Thus, in United States v. Clark, 456 F.2d 1375, 1376 
(10th Cir. 1972), the Court rejected Bruton challenges to an FBI 
agent's testimony in a check-kiting prosecution regarding 
statements by one codefendant (McHenry) about his financial 
dealings with the other defendant (Clark).  McHenry's statement 
admitted that he and Clark together had created false bank balances 
by depositing checks backed by insufficient funds.   Id.  at 1376,  
1378.   The Tenth Circuit nonetheless found Bruton "readily 
distinguishable" because "McHenry's statement didn't incriminate, 
as such, either himself or Clark."  Id. at 1376 (alternative holding).  
The Court explained that McHenry's FBI "statement was not in any 
sense a confession, but was essentially a recitation of the financial 
dealings between the two defendants" and the statement did not 
"amount to an effort on the part of McHenry to attribute criminal 
intent to Clark."  Id. Although both defendants in Clark eventually 
adopted a theory of defense (lack of criminal intent) that accepted 
McHenry's statement to the FBI, the fact remains that the actual 
substance of that statement  (creating false bank balances)  was far 
more facially incriminating  than  the  statements  at  issue here  
(driving  to Oklahoma City, lending a pickup, and emptying a 
storage locker).  
 
Likewise, in United States v. Olano, 62 F.3d 1180 (9th Cir. 1995),  
a bank fraud case where several defendants were jointly tried  for 
having made  several  insider loans  to each other's financial 
institutions, the court rejected Bruton challenges to various pretrial 
statements (including grand jury and deposition transcripts), 
admissible  only  against  certain  codefendants, describing the 
deals.  See id. at 1195-1196.  Among the statements at issue was 
one by a codefendant, who was chairman of a separate financial 
institution, that he had 'two loans for Guy Olano to make.  Id. at 
1196.   Even though this statement  (and others) could be 
powerfully incriminating when considered with other trial evidence 
suggesting a pattern of  insider  loans  among  legally distinct 
financial institutions, the court held that a limiting instruction fully 
protected Olano's rights because "[n]one of the codefendants' 
statements incriminated Olano on their face."  Id. at 1195.  In 
particular, the court deemed the statements "[u]nlike the full-blown 
confession that was the subject of Bruton," because they "plainly 
did not have a sufficiently 'devastating' or 'powerful' inculpatory 
impact to be incriminatory on  [their]  face." Id. (emphasis added).  
 
Many other cases reject Bruton challenges to the admission in a 
joint trial of a codefendant's out-of-court statements regarding 
dealings with the defendant.  The unifying theme of these cases is 
that Bruton does not apply where the codefendant's statements are 
not a confession incriminating the defendant on their face.  See, 
e.q., United States v. Escobar, 50 F.3d 1414, 1422 (8th Cir. 1995) 
(codefendant "Keeper's statement was used only to show that he 
was acquainted with [defendants] Escobar and Duarte and he lied 
about this fact; this statement by itself does not implicate Escobar 
or Duarte in any wrongdoing"); United States v. Smith, 46 F.3d 
1223, 1229 (1st Cir.) ("Admittedly, [codefendant] Cohen's 
statement might tend to incriminate [defendants] Smith and 
Devaney by showing that the coconspirators met to discuss damage 
control" but "[i]n this sense,  however,  the  statement falls  far 
outside  the  pale  of 'powerfully incriminating' evidence that 
produces Bruton errors"), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 176  (1995); 
United States v. Foree, 43 F.3d  1572,  1578  (11th  Cir.  1995)  
("there still  remains  the predicate question of whether 
[codefendant] Draznin's disjointed lamentations, even when 
identified with [defendant] Foree, were the kind of powerfully 
incriminating, directly inculpatory confessions that the 
Confrontation Clause protects against in this context"; court went 
on to find no plain error even assuming a Bruton violation)  
(emphasis in original; quotations omitted).  
 
Nichols'  core statements are like the statements in these cases, and 
unlike the "full-blown confession" in Bruton, because they admit  
to no wrongdoing by either he or McVeigh.   Those statements are 
relevant because they link Nichols to McVeigh on the critical days 
surrounding the bombing but they do not,  in the absence of 
independent evidence linking defendants to the bombing, prove 
either guilty of the crime.   The statements thus are not "facially   
incriminating   confessions"   governed   by  Bruton. Richardson, 
481 U.S. at 208-211.  
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Nichols'  statements,  describing his activities with or on behalf of 
McVeigh in the days immediately surrounding the bombing, are 
admissible in either a joint trial or in separate trials. Respectfully 
Submitted,

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
 
Plaintiff 
 
v. 
 
TIMOTHY JAMES McVEIGH and TERRY LYNN NICHOLS  
 
Defendants. 
 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION IN LIMINE 
 
It is hereby ORDERED that the United States may introduce 
testimony, in a joint trial, of Nichols' statements about driving 
McVeigh from Oklahoma City to Kansas on April 16, lending him 
his truck on April 18, and cleaning out his locker on April 20.  
After conducting a statement-by-statement review, the Court finds 
that these statements in which Nichols admits associations with 
McVeigh before and after the bombing are admissible not only 
against Nichols but also against McVeigh as declarations against 
interest pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(3).  Williamson v. United 
States, 114 S. Ct. 2431, 2435 (1994).  Alternatively, the Court 
finds that McVeigh's rights can be protected fully by limiting 
instructions, and that  the narrow Bruton exception does  not  apply 
because Nichols' statements are not on their face a "confession" 
that is "devastating"  to,  and  "powerfully incriminating"  of,  
McVeigh. Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200 (1987).

ENDNOTES 
 
 
1.  This motion does not seek to resolve the admissibility of all  
Nichols'  statements  to  the  FBI,  and  the United  States 
anticipates that the parties will litigate discrete evidentiary issues 
as the case proceeds to trial. Nichols made many statements which 
did not mention McVeigh and others which did but nonetheless are 
relevant without reference to McVeigh by name (e.q., Nichols 
described his own family and work history, admitted renting 
various storage sheds, and discussed his knowledge of how 
ammonium nitrate can be used to make a bomb).   There are certain 
statements mentioning  McVeigh  by  name  (e.q.,  Nichols' remark  
that  he "suspect[ed]" McVeigh was involved in the bombing) that 
we do not and will not seek to have admitted at trial.  
 
2.  See also Lane, 883 F.2d at 1498 ("If all the evidence in a joint 
trial of defendants was admitted against each defendant, no such 
prejudice could result  from the joint trial because the evidence  
would be precisely as  it would at  each defendant's separate trial"); 
United States v. Adams, 470 F.2d 249, 251 (10th Cir. 1972)  
("language of Bruton suggests that it applies only to inadmissible 
hearsay, and we have so held") (citing 391 U.S. at 128 n.3, where 
Bruton Court "emphasize[d] that the hearsay statement inculpating 
petitioner was clearly inadmissible against him").

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
Plaintiff

TIMOTHY JAMES McVEIGH and TERRY LYNN NICHOLS  
Defendants. 
 
BRIEF OF THE UNITED STATES IN OPPOSITION TO 
DEFENDANT McVEIGH'S MOTION TO ALLOW 
REPRESENTATIVES TO ATTEND EXHUMATION AND 
EXAMINATION OF LAKESHA LEVY  
 
The United States opposes defendant McVeigh's motion to allow 
three of his representatives (an attorney, photographer and 
pathologist) to be present at the exhumation and examination of 
bombing victim Lakesha Levy. Exhumation, the disinterment of a 
corpse, is an exceedingly delicate act that unfortunately is 
necessary here because there are indications that Ms. Levy was 
interred with a left leg belonging to another victim.  Ms. Levy's 
family, specifically her husband Corey and mother-in-law Joyce 
Davis, have not objected to exhumation but have expressed a 
preference that representatives of the defense not be allowed to 
attend.  Unless this Court orders otherwise, exhumation will occur 
sometime in the coming days in the presence of representatives of 
the Orleans Parish Coroner's Office, the Oklahoma State Medical 
examiner's Office, the FBI and Ms. Levy's family.  As set forth 
below, there is no basis in either Fed. R. Crim. P. 16 or in the 
Constitution for McVeigh to insist on the additional presence of his 
own representatives.  
 
I.  Background 
 
On May 30, 1995, after the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building had 
been professionally imploded, a traumatically amputated left leg 
was discovered for the first time in the building's rubble.  A 
military style black leather boot was on the leg.  McVeigh's 
counsel Stephen Jones, who announced the existence of this 
unidentified left leg to the press in August 1995, speculated 
publicly that it may have belonged to the "real bomber."  See, e.g., 
L.A. Times, Aug. 8, 1995, at 4.  
 
On August 30, 1995, the Oklahoma Medical Examiner's Office 
reported that the FBI's DNA testing and hair examination indicated 
that, contrary to that Medical Examiner's Office initial probability 
estimates, the left leg belonged to a female of African ancestry.  It 
was announced on that date that the leg did not match any of the 
eight victims who were known to, or could, be missing left legs.  
 
On February 23, 1995, the Oklahoma Chief Medical Examiner 
held a press conference announcing that the FBI's and his further 
testing of this matter led him to conclude that the left leg belonged 
to Lakesha Levy, a 21-year-old Airman First Class in the United 
States Air Force who was visiting the Murrah Building on April 
19, 1995, to obtain a Social Security card.  This opinion was based 
on:  1) a footprint that matched one taken from Ms. Levy at birth; 
and 2) DNA testing.  The Medical Examiner admitted that his 
Office was likely in error when, among other things, it identified 
the left leg buried with Ms. Levy as being attached to her body and 
being clad in a military boot.  It is now believed that only Ms. 
Levy's right leg in fact was attached to her body and that the buried 
left leg belongs to another victim.  
 
Lakesha Levy's remains are stored in an above-ground vault in 
New Orleans, Louisiana, where her husband Corey Levy lives with 
the couple's child.  Exhumation is planned to occur sometime in 
the coming days in the presence of representatives of the Orleans 
Parish Coroner's Office (and possibly a representative of a funeral 
home), the Oklahoma State Medical Examiner's Office, the FBI 
and Ms. Levy's family.  It is anticipated that the unattached left leg 
now placed with Ms. Levy will be removed from the coffin, Ms. 
Levy's real left leg will be substituted for it, and the coffin will be 
resealed in the vault.  Ms. Levy's family, specifically her husband 
Corey and mother-in-law Joyce Davis, have not objected to 
exhumation but have expressed a preference that defense 
representatives not be allowed to attend.  
 
The previously unidentified left leg, which is now believed to 
belong to Lakesha Levy, is being made available by the Oklahoma 
Medical Examiner's Office for testing by defense experts.  A 
pathology expert hired by McVeigh's counsel is examining the 
previously unidentified left leg today, February 26, 1996.  An 
expert for Nichols is currently scheduled to examine that same leg 
on Thursday, February 29, 1996.  Moreover, the unattached left leg 
that is expected to be removed from Ms. Levy's coffin likewise 
will be made available for defense testing.  
 
The only question presented is whether defense representatives 
have a legal right under these circumstances to be present at the 
exhumation of Ms. Levy's body.  McVeigh claims such a right 
pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 16 and perhaps under the United 
States Constitution as well.  
 
II. Argument 
 
A.  McVeigh Has No Rule 16 Right To Have Representatives 
Present At The Exhumation.  
 
Rule 16(a)(1)(C), in relevant part, allows federal criminal 
defendants access to "books, papers, documents, photographs, 
tangible objects, [and] buildings or places" which are within 
government control and "which are material to the preparation of 
the defendant's defense or are intended for use by the government 
as evidence in chief at the trial."  Nowhere does the rule provide 
for access to a decedent's body; rather, McVeigh apparently 
assumes that Lakesha Levy's physical remains are just another 
form of the "Documents and Tangible Objects" governed by the 
Rule. A leading California case rejected precisely this analogy 
because:  
 
 
There is a clear distinction between examination of physical 
evidence such as handwriting exemplars, fingerprints, written 
statements, and the body of a human being.  The former are 
susceptible of examination without the likelihood of outrage to the 
emotional feelings of the living.  As reflected in our laws, our 
society extends more respect to a dead body than to other physical 
evidence.  
 
 
People v. Vick, 11 Cal. App.3d 1058, 1064-1065, 90 Cal. Rptr. 
236, 240 (Cal. Ct. App. 1970).  
 
The only federal decision we have found predates Rule 16 and 
arose in District of Columbia courts, but is even closer on point. 
Laney v. United States, 294 F. 412, 415 (D.C. 1923), held that "[i]t 
was not error to admit testimony relative to the disinterment and 
post mortem examination of the body of the deceased" because 
"[i]t was unnecessary that notice should be given the defendant of 
the intention on the part of the government to make the 
investigation."  Most state cases are in accord in holding that a 
defendant generally has no right to be present at the disinterment of 
a victim's body.  See generally Anno., Disinterment in Criminal 
Cases, 63 A.L.R.3d 1294, 1300, 1329-1330; see also State v. 
Buchanan, 330 N.C. 202, 410 S.E.2d 832, 842 (1991) ("In State v. 
Bowman, 80 N.C. 432 (1879), the Court declined to extend a 
capital defendant's right to be present to include presence at the 
disinterment of the remains of the deceased").  
 
Even assuming Ms. Levy's body were a "Document or Tangible 
Object" covered by Rule 16, however, McVeigh still would not be 
entitled to access to it at the exhumation because Rule 16(a)(1)(C) 
is limited by its terms to those objects "which are material to the 
preparation of the defendant's defense or are intended for use by 
the government as evidence in chief at the trial."   The latter 
provision is clearly inapplicable because the United States will not 
introduce Ms. Levy's body at trial.   (Ms. Levy's autopsy 
photographs already have been provided to the defense, as will any 
photographs taken after the exhumation.)  Nor can McVeigh show 
the materiality of Ms. Levy's body to his defense.  It bears noting 
in this regard that McVeigh's claimed right of access to the body is 
far weaker than even the claims rejected in cases such as Laney 
and Vick, where the decedent was a murder victim and there 
existed at least some dispute as to the cause of death.  
 
The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not allow a defendant 
to insist that his representatives be present during scientific testing 
or the evidence gathering process that precedes it.  Instead, a 
defendant's ability to defend against criminal charges is fully 
protected by his right to material "results or reports... of scientific 
tests or experiments" and "a written summary of [expert] 
testimony" that "describe[s] the witnesses' opinions, the bases and 
the reasons therefor, and the witnesses' qualifications." Fed. R. 
Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(D & E).  The United States will fully comply 
with its Rule 16 obligations in this and all other respects.  
 
Case law uniformly holds that Rule 16 obligations are not triggered 
until after a scientific test has generated a "report or result" or until 
after the prosecution has decided upon expert testimony to be 
offered at trial. Thus, the Tenth Circuit has described Rule 
16(a)(1)(D) as imposing upon the government the obligation to 
"promptly disclose the results" of any expert testing.  United States 
v. Cowen, 32 F.3d 1466, 1470 (10th Cir. 1994).  There is no right 
to discover scientific procedures -- much less the evidence 
gathering process precedent to such procedures -- that "do not have 
the requisite formality of finality to be considered as either a 
'report' or a 'record.'"  United States v. Iglesias, 881 F.2d 1519, 
1923 (9th Cir. 1989). Specifically, Rule 16 does not extend to 
materials that "contain no results, conclusions, diagnoses or 
summations." United States v. Dennison, 937 F.2d 559, 566 (10th 
Cir. 1991) (following Iglesias in deciding reciprocal discovery 
obligations of defense pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b)(1)(B)).  
 
These cases make clear that McVeigh has no right to advance 
notice of, much less any right to attend, scientific tests before they 
have yielded a final result. Instead, the thrust of Rule 16 provisions 
regarding experts is that a defendant be provided discovery of 
completed tests in "sufficient time to conduct his own independent 
tests and adequately cross-examine any Government witnesses."  
United States v. Edmonson, 962 F.2d 1535, 1546 (10th Cir. 1992).  
 
In contrast, the cases relied upon by McVeigh simply preclude "a 
trial by ambush" because "fairness requires that adequate notice be 
given to the defense to check the findings and conclusions of the 
government's experts." United States v. Kelly, 420 F.2d 26, 29 (2d 
Cir. 1969). These cases do not compel defense presence at 
evidence gathering and government testing but merely require "a 
fair opportunity for the defense to run its own "scientific] tests" if 
it so chooses.  Id.  See also United States v. Stifel, 433 F.2d 431, 
441 (6th Cir. 1970) ("if the government sees fit to use this time 
consuming, expensive means of fact-finding, it must both allow 
time for a defendant to make similar tests, and in the instance of an 
indigent defendant, a means to provide for payment of same"). 
Only one case cited by McVeigh suggests (in dicta) that "[u]nder 
the circumstances [t]here, it is evident that the preferred procedure 
under Rule 16, F.R.Crim.P. would be to permit the defendant's 
expert to participate in the" government's testing. United States v. 
Love, 482 F.2d 213, 220 (5th Cir. 1973).  That case is clearly 
distinguishable from this one, however, because the key 
"circumstance" cited by the court was that the government's testing 
resulted in "consumption of the acetone swabbings" taken from 
defendant's hands and thus "the defendants' expert was unable to 
duplicate tests of the swabbings."  Id. at 215.  
 
McVeigh's Rule 16 claim thus fails because he has not shown that 
his representatives' presence at the exhumation is necessary to 
provide him access to any tangible object that is material to his 
defense.  McVeigh's claims of materiality is strained even with 
respect to the underlying issue of whether the leg in question 
belongs to Lakesha Levy (as we now believe) or to some other 
victim.  Even assuming this issue were material, however, 
McVeigh's Rule 16 rights are fully protected by:  1) his access to 
both that leg and any leg removed from Ms. Levy's coffin (which 
will allow him to conduct any of his own testing he sees fit); 2) his 
access to all autopsy photographs; and 3) his access to all 
government reports of scientific testing.  
 
B.  McVeigh Has No Constitutional Right To Have 
Representatives Present At The Exhumation.  
 
In making a claim that "the leg and all evidence concerning the leg 
are exculpatory" (Motion at 3 Paragraph 5), McVeigh apparently 
invokes what the Supreme Court has referred to as "the area of 
constitutionally guaranteed access to evidence."  Arizona v. 
Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51, 55 (1988) (internal quotes omitted); see 
generally Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).  There is no 
indication, however, that the left leg in question (regardless of to 
whom it belongs) in any way exculpates McVeigh.  While 
McVeigh originally offered speculation that the leg may have 
belonged to the "real bomber," a Brady claim may not be based on 
"mere speculation" that evidence might help the defense.  Wood v. 
Bartholomew, 116 S. Ct. 7, 10 (1995); see also Youngblood, 488 
U.S. at 58 (due process prohibits only bad faith destruction of 
evidence); California v. Trombetta, 467 U.S. 479, 491 (1984) ("the 
Due Process Clause... does not require that law enforcement 
agencies preserve breath samples in order to introduce the results 
of breath-analysis tests at trial"); United States v. Valenzuela- 
Bernal, 458 U.S. 858, 872 (1982) (courts should not intervene to 
upset "the Executive's good-faith determination" that the evidence 
in question would not be "favorable to the defendant in a criminal 
prosecution"). In any event, McVeigh's rights are fully protected 
by his access to the left leg (and to any leg removed from Ms. 
Levy's coffin) for his own scientific testing.  
 
McVeigh nonetheless claims entitlement to attend the exhumation 
to observe (and apparently participate in) the "very delicate 
determination about whether the leg buried with Ms. Levy was 
'attached'" because he "should not have to accept the Government's 
conclusions in this regard." Motion at 3 Paragraph 4.  Even where 
the identification process is far more critical to the defense than 
here -- for example, where witnesses identify the defendant from a 
photospread -- defendant and his representatives have no right to 
be present.  See United States v. Ash, 413 U.S. 300, 321 (1973).  
Indeed, while a defendant is entitled to counsel where he is the 
subject of a live lineup, there is no constitutional right for defense 
representatives to attend "various other preparatory steps, such as 
systematized or scientific analyzing of the accused's fingerprints, 
blood sample, clothing, hair, and the like." United States v. Wade, 
388 U.S. 218, 227 (1967); see United States v. Cotner, 657 F.2d 
1171, 1173 (10th Cir. 1981) ("The Supreme Court has likewise 
held that the taking of a handwriting exemplar is not a 'critical' 
stage in criminal proceedings which requires the presence of 
counsel").  The reason is that "knowledge of the techniques of 
science and technology is sufficiently available, and the variables 
in techniques are few enough, that the accused has the opportunity 
for a meaningful confrontation of the Government's case at trial 
through the ordinary process of cross-examination."  Wade, 388 
U.S. at 267.  
 
McVeigh suggests his representatives are entitled to be present at 
the exhumation because there are no "compelling circumstances" 
why they should not be.  This argument reverses the proper 
inquiry, which is whether there is any legal right of defense 
representatives to attend the exhumation.  But even accepting 
McVeigh's argument on its own terms, there are compelling 
circumstances -- namely, the privacy interests of the victim's 
family, who do not want McVeigh's representatives present at a 
very traumatic event -- why his representatives should not be 
allowed to attend the exhumation  
 
III.  Conclusion 
 
For the above reasons, McVeigh's representatives have no right, 
under either Rule 16 or the Constitution, to attend the exhumation 
of Lakesha Levy.

MOTION OF THE UNITED STATES FOR A PROTECTIVE 
ORDER STAYING DEFENDANTS FROM PURSUING CIVIL 
DISCOVERY  
 
The United States moves this Court for an order staying defendants 
from pursuing discovery in civil cases arising from the April 19, 
1995, bombing that is the subject of this indictment. Defendant 
McVeigh, represented by counsel appointed under the Criminal 
Justice Act, has improperly sought to expand the criminal 
discovery rights allowed him under federal law by invoking the 
civil process of an Oklahoma state court.  As set forth more fully in 
the accompanying brief, federal case law supports the imposition 
of a protective order preserving the integrity of this prosecution.

BRIEF OF THE UNITED STATES IN SUPPORT OF MOTION 
FOR A PROTECTIVE ORDER STAYING DEFENDANTS 
FROM PURSUING CIVIL DISCOVERY  
 
BACKGROUND 
 
In the wake of the federal indictment of defendants McVeigh and 
Nichols, various civil lawsuits have been filed seeking damages for 
the April 19, 1995, bombing.   McVeigh has conceded to this 
Court that he views these civil suits as an "opportunity to take 
depositions of witnesses and to issue subpoenas for the production 
of items which he could not get from the government."  Docket 
Entry ("DE") 784 at 23.   Indeed, McVeigh deems civil suits 
"extremely important for the defense" precisely because "there [is] 
no basis in the criminal case to subpoena" witnesses before trial.  
Id.  
 
Most  recently, a lawsuit was filed in Canadian County 
(Oklahoma) state court by Edye Smith, whose sons Chase and 
Colton died in the blast, against "McVeigh and other unknown 
individuals." See Amended Petition filed 2/9/96 in Smith v. 
McVeigh, No. CJ 96-18 (Can. Cty. Dist. Ct.) (Exhibit A:1-3).  
Attorney Stephen Jones, who was appointed to represent McVeigh 
in this federal criminal case under the Criminal Justice Act, entered 
his appearance on behalf of McVeigh in the state civil case on 
February 7, 1996. See Exhibit A:4.  McVeigh has not yet filed any 
answer in the civil case, but already Mr. Jones has sought civil 
discovery therein.   See McVeigh's Application for Formal Letter 
of Request to take Depositions in Foreign Courts, filed 2/12/96 
(Exhibit A:6-10).  Mr. Jones' affidavit in support of this civil 
discovery request discusses the allegations in the "parallel" 
criminal case and criticizes the federal government's investigation.  
Exhibit A:15- 23. McVeigh requests that an Oklahoma judge allow 
him to pursue discovery in the civil case, including "depositions in 
Great Britain" (pursuant to letters rogatory) of three alleged 
"British fascists" to examine "their activities in the United States to 
advance their political agenda and whether these discussions 
involved the possibility directly or indirectly of overt activity 
against the federal government, its employees and its property." 
Exhibit A:7. Mr. Jones' supporting affidavit cautions that he "does 
not at this point allege that these individuals are involved in the 
bombing, but instead believes that they may have knowledge of 
motives and participants."  Exhibit A:22.  
 
Mr. Jones' public comments confirm that he wishes to exploit civil 
discovery for the purpose of defending McVeigh in this federal 
criminal case as well as in the press.  For example, an Associated 
Press story on February 9, 1996 (three days before McVeigh's 
deposition requests were filed in state court), reported that "Jones 
said the depositions may be used in the federal [criminal] case." 
"McVeigh Attorneys Seek Subpoenas," AP, Feb. 9, 1996 (Exhibit 
B:1); see also Exhibit B:3 (Mr. Jones' statement on Feb. 5, 1996, 
edition of NBC's Today Show, that:  "I think there may be a link 
not involving my client but that there may be a link between some 
very radical right-wing groups in this country and the neo-Nazis in 
Britain and Germany that may have been part of a conspiracy to 
bomb the federal building"); Exhibit B:5-8 (Mr. Jones' interview 
that same day on CBS This Morning); "McVeigh Lawyer Looks 
into European Conspiracy Theory," Daily Oklahoman, Feb. 5, 
1995, at 07 (Exhibit B:9-11).  
 
ARGUMENT 
 
It is well established that "in appropriate circumstances, the district 
court has authority under [Federal] Rule [of Criminal Procedure] 
16(d) to prevent the parties from abusing discovery procedures, 
including attempts to avoid the limitations on criminal discovery 
through the use of civil discovery provisions."  United States v. 
Stewart, 872 F.2d 957, 962-963 (10th Cir. 1989) (citing SEC v. 
Dresser Industries, 628 F.2d 1368, 1373 (D.C. Cir. 1980); 
Campbell v. Eastland, 307 F.2d 478 (5th Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 
371 U.S. 955 (1963)).   In many cases "[f]ederal courts have 
deferred civil proceedings pending the completion of parallel 
criminal prosecutions when the interests of justice seemed to 
require such action, sometimes at the request of the prosecution...." 
United States v. Kordel, 397 U.S. 1, 12  (1970); e.a., RaPhael v. 
Aetna Casualty and Surety Co., 744 F. Supp. 71 (S.D.N.Y. 1990); 
LaRouche Campaign v. FBI, 106 F.R.D. 500 (D. Mass. 1985).  
 
Judge Wisdom's seminal opinion in Campbell v. Eastland outlined 
the reasons courts should ensure that defendants do not circumvent 
the restrictions on federal criminal discovery by seeking more 
liberal civil discovery in a related case.  One important reason is 
not to add to "the defendant's existing advantages" in a criminal 
case.  307 F.2d at 487 n.12 (internal quotations omitted).  Not only 
must the federal prosecution prove a defendant's guilt beyond a 
reasonable doubt to a unanimous jury of twelve citizens, it must do 
so after having provided the defense with statutorily and 
constitutionally mandated discovery. In contrast, "the self-
incrimination privilege would effectively block any attempts to 
discover" information directly from the defendant. Id.  The present 
case -- in which the United States has provided McVeigh with 
discovery of more than 10,000 witness statements and a massive 
quantity of physical evidence while receiving virtually nothing in 
return -- is a prime example of a federal criminal defendant's built-
in "advantages."  McVeigh should not be allowed the additional 
advantage of using civil discovery to prepare to defend against 
federal criminal charges.  
 
A case closely on point is United States v. Phillips, 580 F. Supp. 
517 (N.D. Ill. 1984).  The court there ordered the defendant to 
"cease taking or receiving further discovery in the state court case," 
which had been filed against him five months before his federal 
indictment, "until his criminal trial in this Court has been 
completed."  Id. at 520.  The court based this order on the facts 
that:  
 
 
A review of the discovery materials already obtained and requested 
by Phillips in the civil action indicates that Phillips has 
unquestionably utilized the state civil discovery rules for the prime 
purpose of obtaining materials to which he is not entitled under 
federal criminal discovery rules.   Although some of the 
information sought by Phillips relates to the state court slander 
suit, much more of the discovery is aimed at Phillips' upcoming 
criminal trial.  This abusive tactic is an improper circumvention of 
the criminal discovery rules. Protection of the integrity of the 
criminal justice process fully justifies this Court's taking remedial 
action.  
 
 
Id. at 519-520. 
 
Stay orders have been issued regardless of whether the civil lawsuit 
was brought and discovery was sought for reasons entirely 
independent of the criminal case.  E.q., Campbell v. Eastland, 307 
F.2d at 488 ("whether or not the suit, as distinguished from the 
motion was bona fide, the effect of granting the motion was to give 
pre-trial discovery of documents denied the taxpayer in the 
criminal case"); In re Eisenberg, 654 F.2d 1107, 1113-1114 (11th 
Cir. 1981) ("Even if Eisenberg possessed the purest of motives, he 
would have been the beneficiary of materials otherwise unavailable 
to him under the criminal rules if the motion were granted, thus 
nullifying in effect the criminal discovery limitations"); Twenty 
First Century Corp. v. LaBianca, 801 F. Supp. 1007, 1010 
(E.D.N.Y. 1992) (stay ordered even though "[n]o party to this 
action contends that the civil case was brought solely to obtain 
broader discovery in the criminal case").  Indeed, defendants have 
been stayed from pursuing civil discovery even where it was the 
federal government that simultaneously was pursuing both the 
criminal and civil cases. F.q., In re Ivan F. Boesky Securities 
Litigation, 128 F.R.D. 47, 48 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (staying civil 
discovery where "Michael Milken and Lowell Milken are 
defendants in parallel civil and criminal cases brought respectively 
by the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') and the 
United States Attorney"). It is enough in such cases that "the 
similarity of the issues left open the possibility that [defendant] 
might improperly exploit civil discovery for the advancement of 
his criminal case."  United States v. Mellon Bank, N.A., 545 F.2d 
869, 873 (3d Cir. 1976).  
 
This clearly is an appropriate case for ordering McVeigh 
temporarily not to pursue or receive any civil discovery.  McVeigh 
has conceded to this Court that he views these civil suits as an 
"opportunity" to obtain discovery, particularly pretrial witness 
depositions, that he could not legitimately obtain in this criminal 
case.  DE 784 at 23.  Moreover, Mr. Jones' affidavit in support of 
his civil discovery request spends far more time discussing the 
allegations in the "parallel" criminal case and criticizing the 
+federal government's investigation than he does responding to any 
separate allegations in the civil case.  See Exhibit A:15-23. Indeed, 
McVeigh sought international discovery in the state case before 
even bothering to respond to the complaint.  The inference is 
unavoidable that McVeigh's discovery-driven response to the state 
civil suit is an effort principally to defend against federal criminal 
charges rather than to litigate whether McVeigh (a sworn indigent) 
is civilly responsible for millions of dollars.  
 
To the extent McVeigh might argue that he has sought civil 
discovery in whole or in part to defend the state case, and not just 
to aid his criminal defense, he clearly is not entitled to the services 
of attorneys appointed under the federal Criminal Justice Act 
("CJA"), 18 U.S.C. Section 3006A.  Whether or not McVeigh's 
attorneys are actually billing the United States for time spent 
defending the civil case, CJA funds are subsidizing their overall 
representation of McVeigh.  Those lawyers are not entitled to use 
federal funds to subsidize their representation, including overseas 
discovery, of a civil defendant in a state case.  
 
This Court accordingly should issue a protective order staying 
defendants from pursuing or receiving discovery in any civil case 
pending the outcome of this criminal proceeding.  The United 
States has no indication that defendant Nichols has ever sought to 
exploit civil discovery, but the proposed order would include him 
as well. In addition, the proposed order would require defendants 
to notify the Court and the United States of any civil litigation in 
which they are named parties, so that the need for any further relief 
may be determined.  
 
CONCLUSION 
 
For the above reasons, the Court should enter an order staying 
defendants from pursuing discovery in civil cases arising from the 
April 19, 1995, bombing.  A proposed order is attached.

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT WESTERN 
DISTRICT OF 
OKLAHOMA 
 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
 
Plaintiff, 
 
v. 
 
TIMOTHY JAMES MCVEIGH and TERRY LYNN NICHOLS. 
 
Defendants. 
 
 
No. CR-95-110 MH 
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER ON MOTIONS FOR 
CHANGE OF VENUE 
 
 
MATSCH, District Judge* 
 
     This criminal proceeding arises from an explosion in 
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on April 19, 1995, at 9:02 a.m. 
The measurable effects of that event include the deaths of 
168 identified men, women and children, injuries to 
hundreds of other people. the complete destruction of the 
Alfred P. Murrah Federal Office Building and collateral 
damage to other buildings, including the United States 
Courthouse. A damage assessment prepared for the Office of 
State Finance, The State of Oklahoma, estimated the total 
incident cost at $651.594.000. The immeasurable effects on 
the hearts and minds of the people of Oklahoma from the 
blast and its consequences were thoroughly explored in the 
hearing on the defendants' motions for a change of venue 
under Rule 21 (a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal 
Procedure in Oklahoma City on January 30 through February 
2, 1996. 
 
     Through the grand jury indictment filed in this 
district on August 10, 1995, the government has charged 
that Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols conspired with 
others unknown, beginning in September 1994, to use a 
"truck bomb" to damage the Alfred P. Murrah Federal 
Building and to kill and injure the people in it and that 
these two defendants caused the explosion on April 19,1995. 
Other counts charge these defendants, jointly, with the use 
of a bomb as a weapon of mass destruction, resulting in 
federal property damage and death and personal injury in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. Sections 2332a and 2(a) & (b); with 
the intentional, willful and malicious damage and 
destruction of government property and death and injury to 
persons by means of an explosive bomb placed in a truck in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. Sections 844(f) and 2(a) & (b) and 
with first degree murder of eight federal law enforcement 
officers in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sections 1114, 1111 and 
2(a) & (b) and 28 C.F.R. 64.2(h). The prosecution has filed 
notices of intention to seek the penalty of death as to 
both defendants on all counts. 
 
     Article III of the United States Constitution provides 
that criminal trials shall be held in the state where such 
crimes have been committed. The Sixth Amendment of the 
Constitution provides as follows: 
 
In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the 
right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of 
the State and district wherein the crime shall have been 
committed-- 
 
     The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the 
United States Constitution requires fundamental fairness in 
the prosecution of federal crimes. The right to an 
impartial jury in the Sixth Amendment and the fundamental 
fairness requirement of the Due Process clause will 
override the place of trial provisions in both Article III 
and the Sixth Amendment in extraordinary cases. That is the 
foundation for Fed. R. Crim P. 21 (a) providing for a 
change of venue to protect from prejudice. The rule reads 
as follows: 
 
The court upon motion of the defendant shall transfer the 
proceeding as to that defendant to another district whether 
or not such district is specified in the defendant's motion 
if the court is satisfied that there exists in the district 
where the prosecution is pending so great a prejudice 
against the defendant that the defendant cannot obtain a 
fair and impartial trial at any place fixed by law for 
holding court in that district. 
 
     The Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules, published 
with this rule in 1944, make clear that a change of venue 
can be granted only on the motion of a defendant since the 
constitutional requirement for trial in the state and 
district where the offense was committed under Article III 
and Amendment VI is a right of the defendant. The filing of 
the motion waives that right. 
 
     The initial question is whether the evidence now 
before the court shows that there is so great a prejudice 
against these defendants in the Western District of 
Oklahoma that they cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial 
at any place fixed by law for holding court in this 
district. 
 
     Oklahoma City is the principal place for holding 
court. Judge Alley found that obtaining an impartial jury 
in Oklahoma City would be "chancy." He designated Lawton, 
Oklahoma as the place for this trial under the authority of 
Fed. R. Crim. P. 18 requiring that due regard be given to 
the convenience of the defendants and the witnesses. The 
defendants filed objections to that designation. The 
evidence presented at the hearing on the defendants' Rule 
21(a) motion demonstrates that a trial of these charges in 
Lawton is not practicable. The facilities there are 
inadequate. It was stipulated that renovations to the 
courthouse and related facilities would cost at least $1 
million dollars. The time needed for construction would 
delay scheduling the trial. 
 
     There is no disagreement among the parties with Judge 
Alley's concern about a trial in Oklahoma City. The effects 
of the explosion on that community are so profound and 
pervasive that no detailed discussion of the evidence is 
necessary. The motions for change of venue are granted as 
to the Western District of Oklahoma. 
 
     The selection of an alternative venue is within the 
discretion of the court. The government has suggested 
transfer to the Northern District of Oklahoma with trial at 
the restored historic courthouse in Tulsa. Although the 
defendants argue that they do not have to prove prejudice 
in that district, the court has considered Tulsa as the 
presumptive transferee district because of the language of 
Article III, Sec. 2, Par. 3, and the expressed wishes of 
many of the victims as revealed in the evidence and the 
arguments of government counsel. 
 
     Although no one has suggested a trial in the Eastern 
District of Oklahoma, to avoid further controversy the 
focus of this inquiry is enlarged to consider whether there 
is so great a prejudice against these defendants in the 
State of Oklahoma that they cannot obtain a fair and 
impartial trial anywhere in the state. 
 
     Ordinarily, the effects of pre-trial publicity on the 
pool from which jurors are drawn is determined by a careful 
and searching voir dire examination. That is the preferred 
practice in this judicial circuit. United States v. 
Pedraza, 27 F.3d 1515, 1525 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 115 
S.Ct. 347 (1994); United States v. Abello-Silva, 948 F.2d 
1168, 1177 (10th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 113 S.Ct. 
107(1992). Deferment of the venue motions in this case is 
impracticable and inimical to the public interest in 
obtaining a just determination of these charges without 
undue delay. It is apparent that some special 
precautions-and logistical arrangements must be taken in 
preparation for trial of these charges at any location. The 
scope and intensity of the public interest necessitates it. 
The safety of the accused and all trial participants must 
be considered as well. Moreover, a failed attempt to select 
a jury would, itself, cause widespread public comment 
creating additional difficulty in beginning again at 
another place for trial. 
 
     The parties have submitted a large volume of evidence 
concerning news coverage of the explosion, the rescue 
effort, the investigations by law enforcement agencies and 
media sources, the arrests of the defendants, court 
proceedings and community activities. Extensive print news 
coverage in Oklahoma City, Tulsa and Lawton has been 
submitted. Videotapes of local and national telecasts from 
April 19, 1995, to the date of the motions hearing were 
admitted and have been reviewed. 
 
     Initially, national media coverage of the explosion 
was extremely comprehensive. Dramatic pictures of the 
Murrah Federal Building were shown nationwide immediately 
after the explosion. There was intensive coverage of the 
rescue efforts. The immediate reactions of the President, 
the Attorney General, and an FBI spokesman were broadcast 
across the nation. There were extensive interviews with 
injured victims, members of the families of the dead and 
missing persons, rescue and relief workers, and residents 
of Oklahoma City. The Governor of the State of Oklahoma was 
a continual presence in the media coverage, providing 
strong leadership and articulating the needs and spirit of 
the entire state. 
 
     The arrest of Timothy McVeigh on April 21 in Perry, 
Oklahoma as a bombing suspect produced him showing him in 
restraints and clad in bright orange jail clothing being 
led into a van while surrounded by a very vocal and angry 
crowd. Some bystanders could be heard shouting "murderer" 
and "baby killer." This footage was seen nationwide and was 
widely used in later television broadcasts about other 
developments in the government's investigation. There was 
widespread publicity about a search for another suspect 
described as John Doe #2. The arrest of Terry Nichols and 
a search of his brother's farm in Michigan were other 
subjects of national publicity. 
 
     As time passed, differences developed in both the 
volume and focus of the media coverage in Oklahoma compared 
with local coverage outside of Oklahoma and with national 
news coverage. These differences were discussed in the 
testimony of Russell Scott Armstrong, an expert in news 
media analysis. In the weeks following the explosion, there 
was less media coverage of the explosion outside of 
Oklahoma. Developments in the government investigation were 
reported, but such reports were primarily factual in 
nature. Oklahoma coverage, in contrast, remained focused on 
the explosion and its aftermath for a much longer period of 
time. Television stations conducted their own 
investigations, interviewing "eyewitnesses" and showing 
reconstructions and simulations of alleged events. Such 
"investigative journalism" continued for more than four 
months after the explosion. Perhaps most significant was 
the continuing coverage of the victims and their families. 
The Oklahoma coverage was more personal, providing 
individual stories of grief and recovery. As late as 
December 1995, television stations in Oklahoma City and 
Tulsa were broadcasting special series of individual 
interviews with family members and people involved in 
covering the explosion and its aftermath. (See McVeigh 
Exhibit M-11 B). 
 
     According to Armstrong, these differences in media 
coverage reflect the different needs of the Oklahoma media 
market compared to the nationwide media market. He observed 
that, as a national story of great importance, people 
across the country wanted to know the "who, what, where, 
why, and when" of this event. The nation was interested in 
the human story of suffering and renewal, but in a more 
general sense. In contrast, because this was a crime that 
occurred in their state, Oklahomans wanted to know every 
detail about the explosion, the investigation, the court 
proceedings and, in particular, the victims. 
 
     Armstrong opined that the greater informational needs 
of Oklahomans resulted from a perception that Oklahomans 
are united as a family with a spirit unique to the state. 
Indeed, the "Oklahoma family" has been a common theme in 
the Oklahoma media coverage, with numerous reports of how 
the explosion shook the entire state, and how the state has 
pulled together in response. The political leadership of 
the state has repeatedly and consistently emphasized the 
bonds tying all Oklahomans together as family and 
proclaiming to the nation and the world that the survival 
and recovery  from this tragedy is "Oklahoma's story." 
(Nichols Exhibit HA, Epilogue to In Their  Name). Oklahoma 
Governor Frank Keating best described the unity and spirit 
of Oklahoma: 
 
     In the weeks after the bombing, Oklahomans showed the 
world what good people can accomplish when they are faced 
with an overwhelming tragedy. What happened on April 19 was 
the worst instance of terrorism and mass murder in American 
history. What followed set a standard for courage and 
compassion: The Oklahoma Standard. 
 
(Nichols Exhibit P, "The Oklahoma Standard" at 9). This 
same theme is dominant in the books and pamphlets published 
as commemoratives of the event and its aftermath and 
distributed throughout the state. It is also expressed in 
many of the televised interviews of rescue workers and 
citizens on the street. 
 
     There is an evident and understandable pride of 
accomplishment in all that has been done to try to return 
to normalcy. Prominently displayed in the state capitol 
building is the artwork of survivors and families of the 
deceased done at a state sponsored gathering at Quartz 
Mountain under the heading "Celebration of the Spirit." 
Many Oklahomans view a trial of this case as an additional 
challenge and want the opportunity to demonstrate their 
ability to be fair in spite of this extraordinary 
provocation of their emotions of anger and vengeance. They 
seek participation in the trial to demonstrate an ability 
to overcome a tragedy with such powerful emotional impact 
that people have come to measure time by it. 
 
     Pride is defined as satisfaction in an achievement, 
and the people of Oklahoma are well deserving of it. But it 
is easy for those feeling pride to develop a prejudice, 
defined as "(a) an adverse judgment or opinion formed 
beforehand or without knowledge or examination of the facts 
and (b) a preconceived preference or idea." The American 
Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (3d ed. 1992). 
The existence of such a prejudice is difficult to prove. 
Indeed it may go unrecognized in those who are affected by 
it. The prejudice that may deny a fair- trial is not 
limited to a bias or discriminatory attitude. It includes 
an impairment of the deliberative process of deductive 
reasoning from evidentiary facts resulting from an 
attribution to something not included in the evidence. 
-That something has its most powerful effect if it 
generates strong emotional responses and fits into a 
pattern of normative values. 
 
     In this case the repetition of emotionally intense 
stories of loss and grief and the valiant efforts to 
overcome the consequences of this event have developed a 
common belief that the citizens of Oklahoma can and must 
take what many believe to be the necessary last step on the 
road to recovery--participation in the trial of these 
accused men. The character of the crimes charged is so 
contrary to the public expectation of human behavior that 
there is a prevailing belief that some action must be taken 
to make things right again. That theme is dominant in the 
comments of people interviewed by television reporters 
asking about their reactions to court proceedings in this 
case. The common reference is to "seeing that justice is 
done." There is a fair inference that only a guilty verdict 
with a death sentence could be considered a just result in 
the minds of many. 
 
     The emotional burden of the explosion and its 
consequences has been intensified by the repeated and heavy 
emphasis on the innocence of the victims and the impact of 
their loss on their families. The tragic sense is 
heightened by the deaths of infants and very young children 
in the day care center. The horror of that fact has been 
powerfully portrayed by the symbols of teddy bears and 
angels displayed everywhere in Oklahoma. They were placed 
on a Christmas Tree at the State Capitol. The public 
sympathy for victims is so strong that it has been 
manifested in the very courthouse where these motions were 
heard, when on the first day of the hearing a T-shirt was 
sold bearing the following inscription: 
 
Those Lost Will Never 
Leave Our Hearts 
Or be Forgotten 
 April 19,1995 
United States Court 
Western District of Oklahoma 
 
(Nichols Exhibit ZE). The shirt also exhibited the purple 
ribbon which is a ubiquitous symbol of empathy and unity 
throughout Oklahoma, even appearing on special license 
plates. 
 
     The intensity of the humanization of the victims in 
the public mind is in sharp contrast with the prevalent 
portrayals of the defendants. They have been demonized. The 
videotape footage and fixed photographs of Timothy McVeigh 
in Perry have been used regularly in almost all of the 
television news reports of developments in this case. All 
of the Oklahoma television markets have been saturated with 
stories suggesting the defendants are associated with 
"right wing militia groups." File film shows people in 
combat fatigues firing military style firearms to 
illustrate the suggested association. That theme has 
particularly been emphasized with Terry Nichols and his 
brother. These films have also been shown in Denver and on 
national news programs but not with the frequency of the 
use by broadcast outlets in Oklahoma. 
 
     New film showing the defendants in restraints and body 
armor was taken in the sally port of the jail in Oklahoma 
City when they were being brought to court for hearing 
these motions. It was shown nationally and locally in 
connection with reports of the court proceedings. 
 
     The possible prejudicial impact of this type of 
publicity is not something measurable by any objective 
standards. The parties have submitted data from opinion 
surveys done by qualified experts who have given their 
opinions about the results and their meaning. The 
government places heavy reliance on this evidence to 
support the position that a fair and impartial jury can be 
selected in the Northern District of Oklahoma for a trial 
in Tulsa. Such surveys are but crude measures of opinion at 
the time of the interviews. Human behavior is far less 
knowable and predictable than chemical reactions or other 
subjects of study by scientific methodology. There is no 
laboratory experiment that can come close to duplicating 
the trial of criminal charges. There are so many variables 
involved that no two trials can be compared regardless of 
apparent similarities. That is the very genius of the 
American jury trial. 
 
     The expert witnesses who have studied in this area 
have suggested that voir dire of the jury panel is the only 
technique available to minimize the effects of pre-trial 
publicity and that most jurors develop fixed opinions by 
the conclusion of lawyers' opening statements. While those 
opinions may be justified by the research done, consisting 
largely of simulated trials, this view is inconsistent with 
this court's long experience with jury trials both as 
lawyer and judge. That experience fortifies a faith that a 
properly conducted trial with competent counsel on both 
sides with adequate resources available to them will reveal 
the historical facts relevant to the charges and that 
jurors who have adequate protection from external 
influences will reach a just verdict according to the law 
and evidence. 
 
     Extensive publicity before trial does not, in itself, 
preclude fairness. In many respects media exposure presents 
problems not qualitatively different from that experienced 
in earlier times in small communities where gossip and 
jurors' personal acquaintances with lawyers, witnesses and 
even the accused were not uncommon. Properly motivated and 
carefully instructed jurors can and have exercised the 
discipline to disregard that kind of prior awareness. Trust 
in their ability to do so diminishes when the prior 
exposure is such that it evokes strong emotional responses 
or such an identification with those directly affected by 
the conduct at issue that the jurors feel a personal stake 
in the outcome. That is also true when there is such 
identification with a community point of view that jurors 
feel a sense of obligation to reach a result which will 
find general acceptance in the relevant audience. 
 
     The opinion surveys done for this hearing attempted to 
test the ability of the persons questioned to be fair and 
impartial jurors. There has been disagreement with some of 
the questions included in the survey form used by Dr. 
Donald E. Vinson. The government's response has been that 
there are no significant differences in the results 
obtained with those from the defendants' questionnaire. 
That is the type of dispute of interest in academic 
circles. What is most important to this court is that the 
survey forms do not recognize the expanded role of a jury 
in a death penalty case. The first duty is to determine 
after hearing all of the evidence in the case, whether the 
government has proved all of the essential elements of each 
charge beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury must separate 
that standard of legal guilt from any opinions concerning 
probabilities or any notions of moral culpability. The 
commonly used phrase presumption of innocence" is not an 
appropriate or even apt description of the position of an 
accused in this court. What is more descriptive is whether 
a juror is ready, willing and able to give a defendant the 
benefit of a reasonable doubt after careful consideration 
of all of the evidence admitted at a trial. 
 
     If a defendant is found guilty on any of the present 
charges, the jury will then be required to determine 
whether death is justified for the offense of conviction 
after consideration of the mitigating and aggravating 
factors presented by evidence received at a further 
hearing. 18 U.S.C. Sections 3591-3593. The Supreme Court of 
the United States has struggled with the constitutional 
legitimacy of a death sentence under the Eighth Amendment 
since the per curiam decision in Furman v. Georgia, 408 
U.S. 238 (1972), with each of the justices constituting the 
majority writing separate concurring opinions. The question 
became somewhat better focused in a joint opinion of 
justices Stewart, Powell and Stevens in Gregg v. Georgia, 
428 U.S. 153, 189 (1976), explaining that the discretion 
given to a sentencing body "must be suitably directed and 
limited so as to minimize the risk of wholly arbitrary and 
capricious action." There must be individualized 
consideration of the defendant and any mitigating evidence 
relevant to him. Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586 (1978); 
Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104 (1981) (citing Lockett). 
 
     What has been made clear by later cases is that a 
sentencing jury must be prepared to make a moral judgment 
which is individual to the particular defendant after 
consideration of aggravating and mitigating circumstances 
specifically as to him. Moreover, the Court has held that 
due process requires such impartiality of any jury that 
undertakes capitol sentencing that a voir dire examination 
of potential jurors must include inquiry into the views of 
prospective jurors on the death penalty, and those who 
would automatically vote for or against it must be 
excluded. Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719 (1992). General 
questions of fairness and impartiality are insufficient. 
Id. 
 
     Because the penalty of death is by its very nature 
different from all other punishments in that it is final 
and irrevocable, the issue of prejudice raised by the 
present motions must include consideration of whether there 
is a showing of a predilection toward that penalty. Most 
interesting in this regard is the frequency of the opinions 
expressed in recent televised interviews of citizens of 
Oklahoma emphasizing the importance of assuring certainty 
in a verdict of guilty with an evident implication that 
upon such a verdict death is the appropriate punishment. It 
is significant that there is a citizens' movement in 
Oklahoma to support pending legislation which would sharply 
limit the reviewability of a death sentence. 
 
     Upon all of the evidence presented, this court finds 
and concludes that there is so great a prejudice against 
these two defendants in the State of Oklahoma that they 
cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial at any place fixed 
by law for holding court in that state. The court also 
finds and concludes that an appropriate alternative venue 
is in the District of Colorado. 
 
     Denver, Colorado meets all of the criteria that have 
been cited by past cases as relevant when selecting an 
alternative venue. See e.g., United States v. Tokars, 839 
F.Supp. 1578 (N.D.Ga.1993); United States v. Moody, 762 
F.Supp. 1491 (N.D.Ga. 1991). Denver is a large metropolitan 
community-with many community resources. It is readily 
accessible, being well-served by daily non-stop flights 
from all relevant cities. The court facilities in Denver 
are well-suited for accommodating the special needs of this 
trial. The United States Marshal for the District of 
Colorado is well equipped to provide adequate security 
services. A large jury pool is available. 
 
     In reaching this ruling, the court is acutely aware of 
the wishes of the victims of the Oklahoma City explosion to 
attend this trial and that it will be a hardship for those 
victims to travel to Denver. The attorneys for the 
government have earnestly argued that statutory provisions 
for victims must be considered by the court. The Department 
of Justice is required to give prescribed care and 
consideration to those affected by criminal conduct. The 
United States Attorney for the Western District of Oklahoma 
has clearly complied with these requirements by providing 
information and staff assistance and will continue to do 
so. Assistant United States Attorney K. Lynn Anderson, who 
heads the Victim Assistant Unit of the United States 
Attorney's Office, described the Unit's continuing efforts 
to assist and inform the 2,200 people identified in the 
Unit's data base. Further, as observed on the record at the 
hearing, this court has considered the brief filed on 
behalf of victims as amicus curiae. The interests of the 
victims in being able to attend this trial in Oklahoma are 
outweighed by the court's obligation to assure that the 
trial be conducted with fundamental fairness and with due 
regard for all constitutional requirements. 
 
Upon the foregoing, it is 
 
ORDERED that this criminal proceeding is transferred to the 
United States District Court for the District of Colorado. 
 
DATED at Denver, Colorado, this 19th day of February 1996.

BRIEF OF THE UNITED STATES IN OPPOSITION TO 
DEFENDANTS' MOTIONS TO STRIKE THE NOTICES OF 
INTENT TO SEEK THE DEATH PENALTY  
On October 20, 1995, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3593(a), the United 
States filed separate notices of its intention to seek the death 
penalty in the event defendants were convicted on any of the 
eleven capital counts charged in the indictment. The separate 
notices apprised defendants McVeigh and Nichols of the five 
statutory aggravating factors, four non-statutory aggravating 
factors, and four mental culpability factors on which the 
government intended to rely at a bifurcated capital sentencing 
hearing.    
 
In moving to strike the notices, defendants challenge 1) the 
constitutionality of the federal death penalty statute,  2)  the 
manner in which the government instituted the capital proceedings 
against them, and 3) the validity of all the statutory and non- 
statutory  aggravating  factors  alleged  in  the  death  notices. 
Defendants' claims, many of the which have been rejected by 
courts construing similar provisions and procedures contained in 
the federal death penalty statute pertaining to drug-related murders 
(21 U.S.C. 848(e), et sea.), fail in all respects.  
 
I.  THE FEDERAL DEATH PENALTY STATUTE IS 
CONSTITUTIONAL  
 A.  The Death Penalty Does Not Constitute A Cruel And Unusual 
Punishment  
 McVeigh's claim that the death penalty violates the Eighth 
Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment 
(DE 454, pp. 47-49)  is foreclosed by Supreme Court precedent. 
See McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 296-297, 300-302 (1987); 
Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 169, 187 (1976)  (lead opinion); 
id. at 207, 226 (White, J., concurring).   
 
B.  Section 3595 Provides For Meaningful Appellate Review  Of 
All Federal Death Sentences   
McVeigh contends that the federal capital sentencing statute 
contained in 18 U.S.C. 3591, et seq., is constitutionally invalid 
because it fails to provide for meaningful appellate review of death 
sentences imposed under its provisions.  DE 454, pp. 17-21. 
Although the Supreme Court has often alluded to the importance of 
meaningful appellate review in upholding the validity of various 
state capital sentencing schemes (See, e.q., Parker v. Dugger, 498 
U.S. 308, 321 (1991); Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U.S. 738, 749 
(1990)  (collecting cases)),  the Court has never specified the 
components of such review and in no instance has it invalidated a 
capital  sentencing  scheme  for  failing  to  accord  meaningful 
appellate review.  See Gregg, 428 U.S. at 195; Proffitt v. Florida, 
428 U.S. 242, 258 (1976).  However structured, appellate review 
procedures are "meaningful" if they are sufficient to "promote[] 
reliability  and  consistency"  (Clemons,  494  U.S.  at  749)  and 
"ensur[e]  that the death penalty is not imposed arbitrarily or 
irrationally" (Parker, 498 U.S. at 321).  As we show" the instant  
appellate review provisions, which track in substantial part the  
U.S. at 166-168, review provisions found adequate in Gregg, 198, 
ensure meaningful appellate review.l   
 
Contrary to McVeigh (DE 454, p. 19), Section 3595(a) does not 
jeopardize meaningful appellate review by providing for review of 
death sentences only "upon appeal by the defendant" See United 
States v. Davis,  F. Supp., 1995 automatically. WL 628013, at *7 
(E.D. La. Oct. 23, 1995)  ("automatic appellate review . . . has not 
been held to be constitutionally required"). McVeigh  speculates  
that  imposing  on  a  capital  defendant  the obligation of filing a 
notice of appeal "takes fatal advantage of a condemned person at 
the height of his vulnerability," but the simple act of filing a notice 
is far from burdensome given the multiple  counsel  with  which  
federal  capital  defendants  are routinely provided at all levels of 
the proceedings (see 18 U.S.C. 3005; 21 U.S.C. 848(q)(4)-(8)) and 
the requirement that the court clerk file the notice if the defendant 
so requests.  Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(5).  In the rare case where a 
condemned prisoner wishes to do  so,  the  Constitution  is  not  
offended  by  a  knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to seek 
review of a death sentence.  See, e.g.,  Gilm v. Utah, 429 U.S. 1012 
. 
 
Nor does  Section  3595  "sharply  curtail[]"  the  scope  of 
appellate review in capital cases.  DE 454, pp. 17, 20-21.  Section 
3595(a) expressly  contemplates  the  parallel  pursuit  of  a 
conventional appeal from the underlying judgment of conviction. 
Section 3595(b), in turn, makes clear that appellate courts "shall 
review the entire record of the capital trial and sentencing 
proceeding. Finally,  Section 3595(c)  mandates that appellate 
courts shall address all substantive and procedural issues raised on 
the appeal of a sentence of death, n and requires that a death 
sentence be vacated if the court determines that the sentence "was 
imposed under the influence of . . . any . . . arbitrary factor" or that 
the evidence failed to "support the special finding of the existence 
of the required [statutory] aggravating factor."  It is thus clear 
"[t]he federal procedure of review of a sentence of death is 
exhaustive" under Section 3595.  Davis, supra, at *7.  As is true of 
the largely similar appellate review provisions in 21 U.S.C.  
848(q), nothing in the statute "alter[s]  .  .  . ordinary standards of 
review"; to the contrary, the special provisions of section 3595 
"serve to emphasize the serious nature of capital cases and the 
importance of careful review." United States v. Chandler, 996 F.2d 
1073, 1083 (llth Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 2724 (1994).    
 
Section 3595(c)(2)(C) also provides that an appellate court n shall 
remand" if it finds that the capital proceedings "involved any other 
legal error requiring reversal of the sentence that was properly  
preserved  for  appeal  under  the  rules  of  criminal procedure."  
The provision does not alter the meaningfulness of the review. In 
the first place,  the provision is limited in application to "other 
legal errors]" than those pertaining to the evidentiary sufficiency of 
the special findings or the existence of "arbitrary factors" 
influencing the imposition of a death sentence. Federal courts have 
consistently construed similar language in 21 U.S.C. 848(q)(3) 
pertaining to the latter two categories of errors as sufficiently broad 
to "require review of any error of law occurring during the 
sentencing phase of the trial."  United States v. Pretlow, 779 
F.Supp. 758, 761-764, 769 (D.N.J. 1991).  See also United States 
v. Walker, F. Supp. , 1995 WL 603587, at *5-6 (N.D.N.Y. Sept. 
26, 1995); United States v. Bradley  880 F. Supp. 271, 282-283 
(M.D. Pa. 1994); United States v. Pitera, 795 F.Supp. 546,  566-
567  (E.D.N.Y.),  aff'd,  986  F.2d 499  (2d Cir.  1992) (table).  Just 
as "no aspect of a capital sentencing hearing is impervious to 
appellate review" under Section 848(q)(3), there is "'no basis for 
thinking that [a] court of appeals will be limited in its power fully 
to review any sentence imposed" under Section 3595. Pitera, 795 
F. Supp. at 567.  Moreover, as Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b) preserves  for  
appeal  n [p] lain  errors  or  defects  affecting substantial rights" 
that "were not brought to the attention of the [district] court," there 
is no reason to think that plain errors during  a  capital  sentencing  
hearing  that  affect  a  capital defendant's  substantial  rights  
would not  be  reviewable under Section 3595(c)(2)(C) as having 
been "preserved for appeal under the rule[]  of criminal procedure" 
governing plain error. Cf.  
 
Chandler,  996  F.2d at  1086,  1097,  1099 n.  7  (comprehensively 
reviewing a broad range of  substantive  and  procedural  issues 
relating to death sentence, including plain error review of claims 
not raised in the district court); United States v. Flores, 63 F.3d 
1342 (5th Cir. 1995)  (comprehensive review accorded).  Section 
3595  thus does not  diminish any other appellate rights, but 
instead provides additional procedural rights of review of death 
sentences.  Accordingly, there is no merit to defendant McVeigh's 
claim that Section 3595 violates equal protection by "singl[ing]  
out  condemned  federal  prisoners  for  diminished appellate 
review" (DE 454, p. 21).  See Bradley, 880 F. Supp. at 283 
(rejecting similar claim).   
 
C. The Federal Death Penalty Statute's Relaxed Evidentiary 
Standards Are Not Unconstitutional   
Section  3593(c)  provides  that  information  at  capital sentencing 
hearings "is admissible regardless of its admissibility under the 
rules governing admission of evidence at criminal trials except that 
information may be excluded if its probative value is outweighed 
by the danger of creating unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, or 
misleading the jury."  Contrary to McVeigh's claim (DE 454, pp. 
21-23), this provision is constitutional.   
 
The Supreme Court has held that relaxed evidentiary standards are 
appropriate at capital sentencing hearings. See Gregg, 428 U.S. at 
203-204; Williams v. New York, 337 U.S. 241 (1949).  See also,  
Schlup v.  Delo,  115 S. Ct.  851,  867 n. 44  (1995)  ("our permit  
reduced  procedural  protections  at decisions sentencing").  In 
Gregg, in rejecting a similar attack on Georgia's statute,  the  Court  
expressly stated that  the  legislature had unwisely . . . chosen not 
to impose unnecessary restrictions on the evidence that could be 
offered" since it was "desirable for the jury to have as much 
information as possible when it makes the sentencing decision." 
428 U.S.  at 203-204. Thus,  the Court concluded that "it is 
preferable not to impose restrictions," as long as the evidence 
presented at a capital sentencing hearing did not unfairly prejudice 
the accused. Ibid. In enacting Section 3593(c), Congress made the 
same permissible decision.  Cf. Bradley, 880 F. Supp. at 290.   
 
Every court that has considered the validity of a similarly- worded  
evidentiary  provision  in  the  Title  21  death  penalty procedures, 
21 U.S.C. 848(j), has concluded that its language is 
constitutionally "sufficient . . . to ensure the reliability of the 
information offered at sentencing. n Walker, supra, at *14.  See 
Bradley, 880 F. Supp. at 290-291; Pitera, 795 F. Supp. at 564-566; 
Pretlow, 779 F. Supp. at 769-771.  There is no reason for this court  
to  reach  a  different  conclusion  with  respect  to  the See Davis, 
supra, at *5 evidentiary standard in Section 3593) (language in 
Section 3593(c) requires "heightened as opposed to lessened 
reliability").  
 
II.  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTED WITHIN THE SCOPE 
OF HER 
 PROSECUTORIAL DISCRETION IN DETERMINING THAT 
THE 
 DEATH PENALTY SHOULD BE SOUGHT 
A.  Defendant McVeigh Was Not Arbitrarily Singled Out For 
Capital Prosecution 
 
There is no basis for McVeigh's claim that he was arbitrarily and 
irrationally singled out for capital prosecution because of  
"political opportunism" on the part of the Attorney General (DE 
454, pp. 14-17).  Given that McVeigh is charged with the deadliest 
act of domestic terrorism in our Nation's history, it was hardly 
arbitrary to seek the death penalty.  Cf. Pitera, 795 F. Supp. at 567-
568 (rejecting claim that the "purported head of a significant drug 
enterprise, n who was "personally alleged to have committed seven 
murders," was arbitrarily selected for capital prosecution). 
 
As the Supreme Court has made clear, the Eighth Amendment is 
not violated because prosecutors possess unfettered discretion to 
determine  which  death-eligible  defendants  will  be  capitally 
prosecuted and which will not be.  See McCleskey, 481 U.S. at 
296- 297, 306-308, 313; Gregg, 428 U.S. at 199 (lead opinion); id. 
at See also, Silagy v. Peters, 905 F.2d 225 (White, J., concurring) 
986, 993-994 (7th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1110 (1991); 
Pitera, 795 F. Supp. at 568.  Absent a showing that the decision to 
seek the death penalty was based on invidious considerations 
something McVeigh does not even allege to have occurred here 
"the policy considerations behind a prosecutor's traditional 'wide 
discretion' suggest the impropriety of our requiring prosecutors to 
defend their decisions to seek death penalties."  McCleskey, 481 
U.S. at 296 (footnote omitted).2  
 
Nor do remarks of the President and the Attorney General in the 
immediate aftermath of the bombing furnish  basis for judicial 
second-guessing of the death penalty decision. Prosecutors "need 
not be entirely 'neutral and detached'" (Marshall v. Jerrico, 446 
U.S. 238, 248 (1980)) or "disinterested" (Wright v. United States, 
732 F.2d 1048, 1056 (2d Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1106 
(1985)) in their enforcement of the law.  As the Nation's chief law 
enforcement officers, the assurances given by the President and the 
Attorney General that those responsible for the bombing would be 
identified,  apprehended,  and vigorously prosecuted to the full 
extent of the law represent a permissible "general zealousness in 
the enforcement process. n See Jerrico, 446 U.S. at 250.  
 
B.  Internal Departmental Procedures Followed By The Attorney 
General In Deciding Whether To Seek The Death Penalty  Not 
Confer Any Rights On Capital Defendants 
 
Under Section 9-10.000 of the United States Attorneys' Manual, 
which  "sets  forth  policy  and  procedures"  applicable  to  all 
potential  federal  capital  cases,  the  Attorney  General  must 
personally authorize prosecutors to seek the death penalty.  Once 
her authorization has been received, federal prosecutors may file 
notice under 18 U.S.C. 3593(a) of their intent to seek the death 
penalty upon conviction.  Nichols asserts that Section 3593(a)'s 
notice provisions "are carried into force by the regulations issued 
by the Attorney General" and thus that the Attorney General's 
decision to authorize seeking the death penalty "is not an exercise 
of prosecutorial discretion," but instead a "formal decision" that 
must be accompanied by an array of procedural rights, including 
the  
right to discovery of all internal Department of Justice memoranda 
upon which the Attorney General based her decision and judicial 
review of the decision itself.  DE 455, pp. 31-32.   
 
We have fully answered these same claims in our response to 
McVeigh's motion to disqualify the Attorney General and to 
preclude the government  from seeking the death penalty. DE 240. 
As explained there, the internal Justice Department procedures are 
neither required by law nor enforceable by criminal defendants 
against  the  government. Rather,  the  capital  authorization 
procedures are merely internal guidelines that assist United States 
Attorneys in recommending, intermediary Departmental officials 
in reviewing, and the Attorney General in determining whether 
capital prosecutions should be initiated.  Such charging decisions 
are at the heart of prosecutorial discretion, and are immune from 
judicial scrutiny in the absence of a preliminary showing that the 
charging decision was made for invidious reasons.  See supra, p. 8; 
Heckler v.  Chaney,  470  U.S.  821,  831-832  (1985). Nor are  
internal Department of Justice memoranda that pertain to the 
exercise of prosecutorial discretion subject to discovery in the 
absence of a prima facie showing of selective prosecution.  See 
Walker, supra, at *21-22.  Nichols has made no such showing.  
 
III.  THERE IS NO CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT 
THAT THE GRAND 
  JURY ALLEGE THE AGGRAVATING FACTORS UPON 
WHICH THE 
  GOVERNMENT WILL RELY AT A CAPITAL SENTENCING 
HEARING 
  
Nichols (DE 45S, pp. 12-19) contends that the statutory notice 
provision  in  Section  3593(a)  violates  the  Fifth  Amendment  
Indictment Clause by permitting prosecutors, rather than the grand 
jury, to determine whether the death penalty should be sought and 
what aggravating factors justify its imposition.  Unsurprisingly, 
Nichols cites no case holding that such peculiarly prosecutorial 
determinations as the decisions whether and upon what terms to 
seek the death penalty are constitutionally committed to the grand 
jury. Cf. Spinkellink v. Wainwright, 578 F.2d 582, 609 (5th Cir. 
1978) (n [Defendant] cites no case, federal or state, which requires 
the prosecutor to list in the indictment the aggravating 
circumstances on which he will rely in seeking the death penaltyn), 
cert. denied, 440 U.S.  976  (1979) .3 Section 3593(a)'s allocation 
of these discretionary  decisions to the  prosecutor  comports  with 
constitutional principles. See McCleskey, 481 U.S. at 296-297, 
306-308; Gregg, 428 U.S. at 199.  
 
The Fifth Amendment requirement that "[n]o person shall be held 
to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on . . . 
indictment of a Grand Jury" is satisfied by an indictment that 
"contains the elements of the offense charged" as "set forth in the 
words of the statute itself." Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 
117 (1974).  For Fifth Amendment purposes, the "legislature's 
definition of the elements of the offense is usually dispositive."  
McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79, 85 (1986) . Thus, when 
not expressly incorporated into the statutory definition of an 
offense,  the Supreme Court has refused to treat as an "element of 
the crime[]" "sentencing factor[s] that come[] into play only after 
the defendant has been found guilty" of the charged criminal 
offense.  Id. at 85-86. In such circumstances, "there is no Fifth 
Amendment right to grand jury indictment on the sentencing 
facts." Buckley v. Butler,  825 F.2d 895, 903 (5th Cir. 1987), cert. 
denied, 486 U.S. 1009 (1988).   
 
These principles apply in capital cases, in which the Supreme 
Court  has  repeatedly made clear that  aggravating factors are 
offenses" (Walton v. Arizona, 497 U.S. neither "separate . 639, 648 
(1990), quoting Poland v. Arizona,  476 U.S. 147, 156 (1986) ) nor 
"'elements' of any offense. n Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U.S. 764, 782 
(1990) . Accord Hildwin v. Florida, 490 U.S. 638, 640-641 (1989); 
Cabana v. Bullock, 474 U.S. 376, 385 (1986). "Like the  
[enhancement  factor]  in  McMillan,  the  existence  of  an 
aggravating factor . . . instead is 'a sentencing factor that comes 
into  play only  after  the  defendant  has  been  found  guilty."  
Hildwin,  490 U.S.  at 640. See also,  Walton,  497 U.S.  at 648 
(aggravating  factors  serve  only  as  "standards  to  guide  [the 
sentencer]").  Indeed, because aggravating factors are not offense 
elements necessary for conviction -- and, hence, are not within the 
purview of the Fifth Amendment's Indictment Clause -- the 
Supreme Court has recognized that n [t]he Constitution permits the 
trial judge,  acting alone,  to impose a capital sentence." Harris v. 
Alabama, 115 S. Ct. 1031 (1995).   
 
Under the  federal capital  sentencing scheme,  aggravating factors 
play a similar post-conviction role in guiding the jury's exercise of 
its capital sentencing discretion. The statutory aggravating factors 
identified in Section 3592(c) are contained in a separate chapter of 
the criminal code than the capital offenses charged in the 
indictment and in no way add to the elements necessary  for  
conviction under  any of  the  charged offenses. Accordingly, there 
was no requirement under the Fifth Amendment's Indictment 
Clause that the aggravating factors be alleged by the grand jury.  
Cf. People v. Owens, 464 N.E.2d 261, 269 (Ill.) ("the indictment 
was  constitutionally sufficient  because  it  charged defendant with 
the offense of murder; "there was no constitutional requirement 
that any aggravating factor be charged), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 963 
(1984).   
 
Nor is a different conclusion required because the mental 
culpability "element" required by 18 U.S.C. 3591(a)(2) for Eighth 
Amendment proportionality purposes (see Tison v. Arizona, 481 
U.S. 137, 157-158 (1987); Enmund v. Florida, 458 U.S. 782, 797 
(1982)) is alleged only in the death penalty notices and will be 
proved at the capital penalty hearing.  Merely because the jury at 
the time of sentencing must make a "gateway" finding as to the 
existence of a mental culpability factor under Section 3S91(a) does 
not mean that such factors are offense "elements" that must be 
included in an indictment.  The Supreme Court has explained that 
its "ruling in Enmund does not concern the guilt or innocence of 
the defendant -- it establishes no new elements of the crime of 
murder that must be found by the jury" and it 'does not affect the 
state's definition of any substantive offense, even a capital offense.' 
n Cabana, 474 U.S.  at 385  & n.  3. Because the proportionality 
inquiry is distinct from the jury's determination whether the 
elements of a capital offense are established,  the  Court noted that 
Enmund neither n imposed any particular form of procedure" that 
the States must  follow nor identified the  "precise point in  [a 
State's] criminal process" at which an Enmund finding must be 
made. 474 U.S. at 386 (emphasis in original). Indeed, it was 
regarded as constitutionally irrelevant whether the Enmund finding 
was made at trial or on appeal.  Ibid.  Clearly then, the culpability 
factor need not be alleged in an indictment charging a capital 
offense.   
 
IV. THE DEATH PENALTY NOTICES WERE SUFFICIENT TO 
INFORM DEFENDANTS OF THE FACTORS ON WHICH THE 
GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO RELY AT ANY CAPITAL 
SENTENCING HEARING 
 
Relying  on  Fed.  R.  Crim.  P.  7(c)'s  requirement  that 
indictments and information must contain "a plain, concise, and 
definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the 
offense charged," Nichols argues (DE 455, pp. 19-21) that the  14  
death penalty notice was facially insufficient to apprise him of the 
aggravating factors on which the government ,intended to rely at 
any capital sentencing hearing.  As we have shown above, 
however, aggravating  factors  are  neither  "offenses"  nor  
"elements"  of offenses that need be alleged by indictment.  As 
such, the pleading requirements in Rule 7(c) do not apply to death 
penalty notices. 
 
Section 3593(a)'s notice provision is not elaborate: in addition  to  
informing  the  defendant  and  the  court  that  the government 
intends to seek the death penalty in the event of a conviction,  the 
government's notice need only "set[]  forth the aggravating factor 
or factors that the government . . . proposes to prove as justifying a 
sentence of death. n  In Chandler, 996 F.2d at 1089,  the court 
described a comparable notice provision in 21 U.S.C. 848(h) as 
merely requiring that the government provide the defendant with "a 
list" identifying each aggravating factor on which it intends to rely.  
Likewise, in United States v. Cooper, 754 F. Supp. 617, 621 & n. 
7, 635-637 (N.D. Ill. 1990), the court upheld the sufficiency of 
death penalty notices that identified the aggravating factors with 
the same degree of specificity as the instant notices.  See also, 
Bradley, 880 F. Supp. at 283-284, 286- 287; Owens, 464 N.E.2d at 
270 (reference to subsection of statutory aggravating factors relied 
upon provided sufficient notice).   
 
Apart from Section 3593(a)'s listing requirement, there is no 
constitutional requirement that the government provide a detailed 
description before trial of the aggravating factors upon which it 
will rely at a capital sentencing hearing.  Courts have often held 
that the enumeration of aggravating factors in a state's capital 
sentencing statute itself accords a capital defendant sufficient 
notice as to the factors on which the prosecution might be expected 
to rely in seeking the death penalty, without further need of a case-
specific listing of aggravating factors.  See Clark v. Dugger, 834 
F.2d 1561,  1566  (llth Cir.  1987)  (collecting cases), cert. denied, 
485 U.S. 982 (1988); Spinkellink, 578 F.2d at 609-610. There is 
similarly no requirement that the prosecution provide capital 
defendants in advance with a road map of the theory of its case in 
aggravation or the evidence that it will present to prove the 
existence of the aggravating factors on which it will rely. See 
Cooper,  754 F. Supp. at 621; Williams v. Commonwealth, 450 
S.E.2d 365, 372 (Va. 1994).  The instant notices identify the five 
statutory  aggravating  factors  by  reference  to  the  statutory 
citation and in language that tracked the statute and identify four 
other  non-statutory aggravating  factors  (including the  factor 
pertaining to victim impact, that tracked statutory language) with 
comparable specificity.  A fortiori, they are legally sufficient.  
 
Finally, defendants' notice complaints ring hollow when the 
alleged aggravating factors are viewed in conjunction with the 
indictment allegation" referenced in the death penalty notices. Each 
and every aggravating factor set forth in the instant death penalty 
notices is grounded in facts alleged in the indictment and in the 
horrible consequences that inevitably followed.   
 
V.  THE FIVE STATUTORY AGGRAVATING FACTORS 
ALLEGED IN THE  DEATH PENALTY NOTICES ARE 
LEGALLY VALID IN ALL RESPECTS   
A.  The Section 3592(c)(1) Aggravating Factor That The  Victims' 
Deaths Occurred During The Defendants' Commission Of Various 
Enumerated Felony Offenses Both Narrows The Class of Death-
Eligible Defendants And Is Otherwise Constitutional  
1.  The Section 3592(c)(1) Aggravating Factor Is Not 
Unconstitutional Because It Duplicates Offenses Or Elements Of 
Offenses Charged In The Indictment   
 
Under 18 U.S.C. 3592(c)(1), it is an aggravating factor if "death or 
injury resulting in death"  has occurred during the commission of 
20 enumerated offenses.  The death penalty notices here cite the 
Section 3592(c)(1) aggravating factor and allege that "'deaths  or  
injuries  resulting  in  deaths"  occurred  during defendants'  
commission  of  five  of  the  enumerated  offenses. Defendants 
contend (DE 454, pp. 23-26; DE 455, pp.  25-29)  that reliance on 
the Section 3952(c)(1)  factor is constitutionally impermissible, as 
the offenses enumerated in Section 3592(c)(1) duplicate in whole 
or in part elements of the offenses charged in the indictment.  In 
defendants' view, this duplication of offenses (or offense elements)  
as aggravating factors  is  impermissible because it fails to narrow 
the class of persons eligible for the death penalty and skews the 
weighing process in favor of death.  
 
Defendants'  argument  is wholly answered by Lowenfield v. 
Phelps, 484 U.S. 231 (1988).  As the Court there stated, "[t]he use 
of 'aggravating circumstances' is not an end in itself, but a means 
of genuinely narrowing the class of death-eligible persons and 
thereby channeling the jury's discretion. R Id. at 244.  n [T]his 
narrowing function may .  .  . be performed by jury findings at 
either the sentencing phase of the trial or the guilt phase. n Id. at 
244-245.  Accordingly, the fact that an aggravating circumstance 
found at the sentencing phase duplicates in whole or in part the 
elements of the crime found at the guilt phase "does not make [a 
death] sentence constitutionally infirm. n Id. at 246.   
 
Cases decided under the federal capital sentencing statute 
applicable to certain drug-related murders, 21 U.S.C. 848(e), et 
seq. (a "weighing" statute), uniformly hold that Lowenfield permits 
juries to consider as a statutory aggravating factor a mental 
culpability element (that the offender intentionally killed) that 
duplicates an element of the capital murder offense.  See Flores, 63 
F.3d at 1370-1372 & n. 31; Chandler, 996 F.2d at 1093; Walker, 
supra,  at *7; Bradley,  880 F. Supp. at 287-289; Pitera, 795 F. 
Supp. at 556-557; Pretlow, 779 F. Supp. at 771-773; Cooper, 754 
F. Supp. at 621-622.  As the Fifth Circuit explained in Flores, not 
all murderers necessarily intend to kill; accordingly, because the 
intent factor applied to only a subclass of all murderers,  its 
consideration "genuinely narrow[ed] the class of persons eligible 
for the death penalty and reasonably justif[ied]  the imposition of a 
more severe sentence on [a particular] defendant compared to 
others found guilty of murder."  63 F.3d at 1370-1371, quoting,  
Zant v. Stephens, 462 U.S. 862, 877 (1983).   
 
The fact that a capital homicide has occurred during the 
commission of a felony is a valid aggravating factor.  See Blystone 
v. Pennsylvania, 494 U.S. 299, 306-307 (1990).  In the context of 
felony-murder prosecutions after Lowenfield,  "federal courts of 
appeals have consistently held that a sentencing jury can consider 
an element of the capital offense as an aggravating circumstance 
even if it i8 duplicitous. n Deputy v. Taylor, 19 F.3d 1485, 1502 
(3d Cir.) (collecting cases), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 2730 (1994). 
Indeed, the Eighth Circuit, which once adopted a rule that barred 
the duplication of offense elements as aggravating factors, has 
since abandoned that position as incompatible with Lowenfield.  
See Snell v.  Lockhart,  14  F.3d 1289,  1304-1305  (8th Cir.),  cert. 
denied, 115 S. Ct. 419 (1994); Perry v. Lockhart, 871 F.2d 1384, 
1392-1393 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 959 (1989).5 
 
That defendants caused the deaths of more than 160 persons during 
their commission of various explosives-related offenses 
enumerated in Section 3592(c)(1)  is  a  factor that  "genuinely 
narrows" the class of death-eligible defendants within the meaning 
of Lowenfield and Zant. Not all murderers subject to federal 
prosecution engage in the commission of the serious felony 
offenses enumerated in Section 3592(c)(1).  Because the Section 
3592(c)(1) aggravator thus  "appl[ies]  only to a  subclass of 
defendants" convicted of  a homicide offense and not  to  "every 
defendant eligible for the death penalty" (Tuilaepa v. California, 
114 S. Ct. 2630, 2635 (1994), quoting, Arave v. Creech, 113 S. Ct. 
1534, 1542 (1993)), it is constitutionally sound.  Cf. Flores, supra. 
6   
 
Nor is a different conclusion required by Strinqer v. Black, 503 
U.S. 222 (1992).  There, the Court held that jury consideration of 
an unconstitutionally vague aggravating factor (that the offense 
was "heinous, atrocious or cruel") was particularly problematic 
under a "'weighing" statute because "it created the risk that the jury 
will treat the defendant as more deserving of the death penalty than 
he otherwise might be by relying upon the existence of an illusory 
circumstance."  503 U.S. at 235.  Unlike in Stringer,  it  cannot  
plausibly  be  argued  that  the  Section  3592(c)(1) aggravating  
factor  here  that  duplicates  offense  elements  i9 
unconstitutionally vague.  As such, Strinqer is irrelevant to the 
resolution of the duplication issue.  See Johnson v. Singletary, 991 
F.2d 663,  669  (llth Cir.),  cert.  denied,  113 S.  Ct.  2049 (1993);  
Bradley  880  F.  Supp.  at  289  (emphasis  in original) ("Strinqer 
addressed the use of invalid factors in the weighing process, not 
the use of duplicative factors.  Since the duplicative factor  is not 
constitutionally invalid,  and is  a permissible statutory aggravating 
factor, it may be considered by the jury in arriving at a sentencing 
decision."); Pitera, 795 F.Supp. at 557. Lowenfeld's holding  that  a  
duplicating aggravating  factor  i8 constitutionally permissible does 
not turn on the nature of the jurisdiction or the stage at which the 
narrowing occurs.   
 
2.  The Section 3592(c)(1) Aggravating Factor Is Not  Improper 
Because It Alleges That Defendants' Death-Resulting Conduct 
Occurred During Their Commission Of Multiple Enumerated 
Predicate Offenses   
Relying on Cook v. State, 369 So.2d 1251, 1256 (Ala. 1978), and 
similar state cases, McVeigh contends (DE 454, pp. 26-29) that the 
death penalty notices are defective because, in alleging the 
existence  of  the  aggravating  factor  in  Section  3592(c)(1) 
pertaining to "death during the commission of another crime," they 
allege the requisite "death(s) or injur[ies] resulting in death'" 
occurred during the commission of five explosives-related offenses 
enumerated in Section 3592(c)(1).  In Cook and other state cases 
relied upon, the courts held that state capital sentencing schemes 
that counted as aggravating circumstances both (1) the fact that  the  
murder  was  committed  during  the  commission  of  an 
underlying felon offense that was robbery, a (2) the fact that the 
murder was committed for pecuniary gain,  were  improperly 
weighted towards death.  McVeigh's effort to invoke this rationale 
in attacking the formulation of the Section 3592(c)(1) aggravating 
factor in the death penalty notices fails for two reasons.   
 
First, the rule that McVeigh urges is not mandated by the Supreme 
Court's Eighth Amendment jurisprudence; rather,  as was noted in 
Wiley v. Puckett, 969 F.2d 86, 95-97 (5th Cir. 1992), the reasoning 
in cases like Cook derived entirely from state-based rules.  Second, 
the Section 3592(c)(1) factor in this case does not rely on a double-
counting of a single offense element to establish multiple 
aggravating factors.  The opposite is true:  the instant Section 
3592(c)(1) aggravating factor relies on multiple means to establish 
the existence of the single factor that the "death(s) or injur(ies) 
resulting in death" occurred during the commission of an 
enumerated offense. Cf. Griffin v. United States,  502 U.S. 
46(1991)  In Flores, 63 F.3d at 1370, 1372-1373, the court held 
that it was permissible for the government to rely on multiple 
subparts of  the  mental  culpability factor,  which is classified as  
an aggravating factor and weighed under  21 U.S.C.  848(n)(1),  to 
establish the existence of that factor.  The same reasoning applies 
here. By committing their death-producing bombing attack in a 
manner that violated several of the offense provisions enumerated 
in  Section  3592(c)(1),  defendants  effectively  dictated  the 
formulation of the Section 3592(c)(1) aggravating factor.  Having 
done so, neither the statute nor the Constitution precludes the 
government from relying on those multiple means to prove the 
existence of the aggravating factor.   
 
McVeigh claims that, by relying on multiple offenses to prove the 
Section 3592(c)(1) aggravating factor, it is likely that a jury will 
consider each predicate offense as a separate aggravating factor 
and thereby increase the likelihood that it will impose a death 
sentence when it weighs any mitigating factors against the 
aggravating factors.  McVeigh's concern, which wrongly 
presupposes that  the  sentencing process  involves  "a rigid and 
mechanical parsing of statutory aggravating factors" (Barclay v. 
Florida, 463 U.S. 939, 950 (1983) (plurality opinion), can be 
alleviated by jury instructions that  eschew quantitative  counting 
in favor of  a qualitative evaluation of the factors and the evidence 
supporting them and that further apprise the jury that the alleged 
multiple offenses are not factors themselves, but simply multiple 
means by which  the  existence of  the  Section  3592(c)(1)  factor 
may be established.  Cf.  Chandler, 996 F.2d at 1093 (noting 
ameliorative effect of instructions explaining weighing process); 
Pitera, 795 F. Supp.  at  557  (same). Similarly,  assuming that 
there  is any requirement that the jurors agree as to the means by 
which an aggravating factor is established, McVeigh is free to 
propose a jury unanimity instruction informing the jurors that they 
must agree as to the existence of any of the alleged predicate 
offenses.  
 
3.  Congress Intended To Include Death-Resulting Violations of 
The Weapons of Mass Destruction Statute As An Aggravating 
Factor Under Section 3S92(c)(1)  
The death penalty notices allege, as part of the aggravating factor  
specified  in  Section  3592(c)(1),  that  "the  deaths  or  injuries 
resulting in death occurred," inte  alia,  "during the commission of 
an offense under  .  .  .  18 U.S.C.  2332a  (use of weapons of mass 
destruction)."  Noting that the text of Section 3592(c)(1)  refers  to  
"section  2339  (use  of  weapons  of  mass destruction," defendant 
Nichols contends (DE 455, pp. 22-23) that the aggravating factor 
as alleged in our notices is impermissibly vague because it is based 
on a "plain invention of terms that do not appear in the statute," 
thereby alleging an aggravating factor "that Congress did not at all 
provide." 
 
Congress undoubtedly made a technical error when it referred to 
"section 2339 as the citation for the statute criminalizing the (use 
of weapons of mass destruction).":  there is no "section 2339" in 
Title 18, and the only provision in Title 18 entitled, "use of 
weapons of mass destruction, n is codified as 18 U.S.C.  2332a. 
"Under general principles of statutory construction," however, it 
has been recognized that "where .  .  .  the legislature has made a 
mistake in a reference in a statute to another statute and the real 
intent of  the legislature  is manifest  and would be defeated by 
adherence to the terms of  the mistaken 
 reference, a court may disregard the mistaken reference or read it 
as corrected in order to give effect to the legislative intent.  Curry 
v. Department of Corrections, 423 So.2d 584, 585 (Fla. Ct. App. 
1982). Colonial Life & Accident Ins. Co. v. American Family Life 
Assurance Co., 846 F. Supp. 454, 463 n. 14 (D.S.C. 1994).  See 
United States Independent Ins. Agents of America National Bank 
of Oregon v.  Inc., 113 S. Ct. 2173, 2182-2186 (1993).  By Section 
3592(c)(1)'s unambiguous reference to death-resulting violations of 
the "weapons of mass destruction" statute, it is evident that 
Congress intended to incorporate the offense described in Section 
2332a, rather than the non-existent provisions of "section 2339."'  
 
B.  The "Grave Risk Of Death" Aggravating Factor In  Section 
3592(c)(5) Is Not Unconstitutionally Vague   
Tracking the words of the statute, the death penalty notices allege 
that, in committing the capital offenses charged in the indictment, 
the defendants "created a grave risk of death to one or more 
persons in addition to the victim(s) of the offense(s). n 18 U.S.C. 
3592(c) (5).  Contrary to McVeigh's claim (DE 454, pp. 29- 30), 
the "grave risk of death" aggravating factor is not 
unconstitutionally vague. In Tuilaepa, 114 S.Ct. at 2635, the Court 
explained that [b]ecause the proper definition' of eligibility and 
selection factors often 'is not susceptible of   mathematical  
precision,'  .  .  . vagueness  review  is  quite deferential."  See also 
Walton,  497 U.S.  at  655. Hence,  an aggravating factor "is not 
unconstitutional if it has some 'common- sense core of meaning . . .  
that criminal juries should be capable of understanding.'" Tuilaepa,  
114 S.Ct. at 2635-2636, quoting, Jurek v. Texas, 428 U.S. 262, 279 
(1976)  (White, J. concurring).8   
 
In Brecheen v. Reynolds, 41 F.3d 1343, 1360-1361 (lOth Cir. 
1994), the Tenth Circuit applied this analysis in rejecting a claim 
that Oklahoma's "great risk of death to more than one person" 
aggravator was unconstitutionally vague.  See also Proffitt, 428 
U.S. at 256 (aggravating factor of "knowingly creat[ing] a great 
risk of death to many persons" was "not impermissibly vague").  
The same conclusion is warranted here. McVeigh has not shown 
that Section 3592(c)(5) is ambiguous; he has shown only that 
variously- worded state "risk of death" provisions have been 
accorded varying interpretations. See  Walker,  supra,  at  *10  
(rejecting  same collection of state cases as indicative of ambiguity 
in federal "grave risk of death" provision).  
 
By its plain terms, Section 3592(c)(5) is applicable whenever a 
defendant, during the commission of a capital offense, "knowingly 
creates] a grave risk of death to 1 or more persons in addition to the 
victim of the offense."  The rule of lenity cannot properly be 
invoked to give the Section 3592(c)(S)  aggravating factor its 
narrowest possible construction.  Cf. Moskal v. United States, 498 
U.S.  103,  107  (1990)  ("we  have  declined  to  deem  a  statute 
'ambiguous' for purposes of lenity merely because it was possible 
to articulate a [narrower] construction" or because there is "a 
division of judicial authority" as to its construction).  Defendant 
McVeigh has not shown why the grave risk of death created by his 
conduct -- exploding a massive truck bomb outside a crowded 
federal building -- would not fall within any reasonable 
construction of Section 3592(c)(5).  See Walker, supra, at *11.  See 
also, Gregg, 428 U.S. at 202-203 (lead opinion).  
 
C.  The "Substantial Planning And Premeditation" Aggravating 
Factor In Section 3592(c)(9) Is Not Vague   
Tracking the words of the statute, the death penalty notices allege 
that defendants "committed the offense(s) after substantial 
planning and premeditation to cause the death of one or more 
persons and to commit an act of terrorism."  18 U.S.C. 3592(c)t9). 
Defendants contend (DE 454, 30-33; DE 455, pp. 23) that the 
phrase "substantial planning and premeditation"  is 
unconstitutionally vague. However,  every court  that  has 
addressed a vagueness challenge  to  the  "substantial  planning  
and  premeditation" aggravating factor in 21 U.S.C. 848(n)(8) has 
concluded that it sufficiently channels the jury's deliberations to 
withstand such an attack.  See Flores, 63 F.3d at 1373-1374; 
Walker, supra, at *9; Cooper, 754 F. Supp. at 623-624.9  See also, 
Davis, supra, at *2 (rejecting vagueness challenge to Section 
3592(c)(9)).  The logic of these cases compels the same result here. 
 
As the court correctly recognized in Cooper, 754 F. Supp. at 623,  
"premeditation"  and  "planning"  are  "commonly understood" 
terms.  The "common-sense core of meaning" of these terms is not 
destroyed when "substantial" is coupled with "planning" in Section 
3592(c)(9).  "Substantiality," too, is a term that is frequently 
employed and commonly understood in the criminal law context.  
See Flores, 63 F.3d at 1373 (collecting examples); Cooper, 754 F. 
Supp. at 623. See also, Blystone,  494 U.S. at 308  ("substantia[l] 
impairment" as mitigating factor).  As the Supreme Court 
explained in addressing the adequacy of an instruction defining the 
concept of reasonable doubt in terms of "actual substantial doubt," 
"the word 'substantial' [is] commonly understood, [to] suggest a 
higher degree of doubt than is required for acquittal under the 
reasonable doubt  standard." Cage v.  Louisiana,  498  U.S.  39,  41  
(1990) (emphasis added).  Courts construing the "substantial 
planning and premeditation" aggravator have accorded the phrase 
"substantial planning" its "commonly understood" meaning (lbid.), 
connoting a higher quantum of planning than the minimum, 
sufficient for the commission of the acts of homicide or 
terrorism10 that must be its object. Thus,  the  "aggravator  is  
sufficiently  definite  and objective to pass constitutional muster."  
Flores, 63 F.3d at 1374.  
 
D.  The "Vulnerable Victim" Aggravating Factor In  Section 
3592(c)(11) Is Not Unconstitutionally Vague   
The death penalty notices allege as a statutory aggravating factor 
that "various victims were particularly vulnerable due to old age, 
youth, and infirmity."  18 U.S.C. 3592(c)(11).  Defendants contend 
(D. 454, pp. 33-34; DE 455, pp. 23-25) that the "vulnerable victim" 
aggravating factor is unconstitutionally vague, as it does not define 
"old age," "youth or "infirmity" and fails to impose a requirement 
that the defendants selected their victims based on these 
vulnerabilities.  An identical challenge to the validity of the 
"vulnerable victim" aggravating factor was rejected in Pretlow, 779 
F. Supp. at 774.  See also United States v. Boult, 905 F.2d 1137, 
1140 (8th Cir. 1990)  (similar terms in U.S.S.G. Guidelines 
Manual  3A1.1 "are not unconstitutionally vague").   
 
As defendants concede (DE 454, p. 33 n. 29; DE 455, p. 23), the 
Supreme Court has recognized that matters of "age" and "youth" 
are both relevant and sufficiently understandable to warrant their 
consideration in capital sentencing proceedings.  See Tuilaepa, 114 
S. Ct. at 2637-2638; Eddinqs v. Oklahoma, 4L U.S. 104, 115-116 
(1982).  That the Court has done so in the context of addressing the 
mitigating value that might be found in a defendant's "youth" and 
"age" does not cast doubt on their understandability merely 
because Congress has chosen to incorporate the terms into an 
aggravating factor.  See Pretlow, 779 F. Supp. at 774.  Each of the 
terms used in the Section 3592(c)(11)  aggravating factor has a 
"common-sense core of meaning" (Tuilaepa, 114 S. Ct. at 2636).  
See Webster's Third New International Dictionary (unabridged 
1981) at 1159 ("infirmity"); id. at 1570 ("old age"); id. at 2654 
("youth"). Moreover, the statute further refines the scope of these 
terms by requiring not only that victims be old, youthful, or infirm, 
but that they be "particularly vulnerable due to" such 
circumstances.  
 
Nor are these terms any less understandable because Section 
3592(c)(11) does not require that a capital defendant be aware of 
his victim's old age, youth, or infirmity.  Defendants must take 
their  crime  victims  as  they  find them. Thus,  there  is  no 
constitutional  requirement  that  a  defendant  be  aware  of  an 
aggravating circumstance pertaining to his victim in order for that 
circumstance to be considered at a capital sentencing hearing.  See 
Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 837-839, 841 (1991)  (Souter, 
J., concurring); cf. United States v. Feola, 420 U.S. 671, 685 
(1975).   
 
At  bottom,  defendants'  challenge  is  not  so much one of 
vagueness, but that the government will be unable to prove that 
any homicide victims were "particularly vulnerable" because of 
"old age, youth, or infirmity."  Whether the government can 
succeed in establishing an actual basis for this aggrivating factor is 
an issue to be resolved at trial.  See Pretlow, 779 F. Supp. at 774.   
 
E.  The "High Public Officials" Aggravating Factor In  Section 
3592(c)(14) Is Not Unconstitutional 
The death penalty notices allege as a statutory aggravating factor 
that the defendants "committed the offense(s) against one or more 
federal public servants who were law enforcement officers, (a) 
while such victim(s) were engaged in the performance of official 
duties,  (b)  because of such victim(s)'  performance of official 
duties,  and  (c)  because  of  such victim(s)'  status  as  public 
servants."18 U.S.C.  3592(c)(14). Claiming that a recently-
promulgated regulation  (28 C.F.R. 64.2  (1995))  "dramatically 
expand[s] the categories of federal employees who qualify as "law 
enforcement officers," McVeigh argues (DE 454, pp. 34-35) that 
the "high public officials" aggravating factor is both 
unconstitutionally vague and "absurdly overbroad" because the 
new regulation has "stripped [Section 3592(c)(14)] of all its ability 
to meaningful narrow the class of offenders eligible for death." 
 
Contrary to McVeigh's claim, 28 C.F.R.  64.2 -- which was 
promulgated  by  the  Attorney  General  four  months  before  the 
enactment of the instant federal capital sentencing statute -- does 
not affect the scope of the "high public officials" aggravating factor 
or its "law enforcement officer" subset.11 Rather,  the regulation, 
which was lawfully promulgated under a delegation of authority  
contained  in  18  U.S.C.  1114 merely  expands  the designated 
categories of "federal officers and employees" who are protected 
under Section 1114's murder provisions.  Although Section 1114 
and the supplemental regulations undoubtedly cover federal 
officers who are "law enforcement officers," neither Section 1114 
nor the supplemental regulations were meant to be co-extensive 
with Section 3592(c)(14).  Hence, the fact that both Section 1114 
and the supplemental regulation include within their protections a 
wide variety  of  federal  "employees"  who  are  neither  "high 
public officials" nor "law enforcement officers" is wholly 
irrelevant in determining Section 3592(c)(14)'s constitutionality. 
 
Section  3592(c)(14)  expressly  defines  a  qualifying  "law 
enforcement officer" as "a public servant authorized by law . to 
engage in the prevention,  investigation, or prosecution,  or 
adjudication of an offense." In so doing, Section 3592(c)(14) 
genuinely narrows the class of death-eligible defendants in terms 
that jurors can readily understand and apply. See Roberts v. 
Louisiana, 431 U.S. 633,  636  (1977)  ("the fact that the murder 
victim was a peace officer performing his regular duties" is a 
permissible aggravating factor).12  
 
VI. THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSTITUTIONALLY RELY 
ON THE NON STATUTORY AGGRAVATING FACTORS 
LISTED IN ITS DEATH PENALTY NOTICES  
A.  Congress Authorized The Government To Allege And The Jury 
To Consider Non-Statutory Aggravating Factors  
In addition to the 15 statutory  "aggravating factors for homicide"  
that  serve  to  narrow  the  class  of  death-eligible defendants, 18 
U.S.C. 3592(c) expressly provides that "[t]he jury . . .  may 
consider whether any other aggravating factors for which notice 
has been given exists."  Defendants nonetheless contend (DE 4s4, 
pp. 39-40; DE 455, pp. 29-30) that Congress did not authorize non-
statutory aggravating factors because Section 3591(a) provides that 
a defendant convicted of a capital offense "shall be sentenced to 
death" if the jury determines that a death sentence is justified "after 
consideration of the factors set forth in section 3592." Defendants 
read Section 3591(a) as thereby precluding reliance on any 
aggravating factor that  is not  statutorily delineated  in Section 
3592.  Defendants' claim is not well taken.   
 
It is a "cardinal rule" of construction "that a statute is to be read is 
to be read as a whole,  .  .  . since the meaning of statutory 
language, plain or not, depends on context."  King v. St. Vincent's 
Hospital, 502 U.S. 215, 221 (1991).  The permissibility of non-
statutory aggravating factors is a pervasive aspect of the instant 
capital sentencing scheme.  Thus, as a complement to the broad 
language in Section 3592(c) authorizing juries to consider non-
statutory aggravating factors, Section 35  (a) (2), in equally broad 
terms, empowers the government to notice any "aggravating factor 
or factors" that it will rely upon "as justifying a sentence of death[,]  
.  .  . including factors concerning the effect of the offense on the 
victim and the victim's family."  During the course of  a  capital  
sentencing  hearing,  the  government  is  further authorized to 
present information "as to any matter relevant to the aggravating 
factor permitted or sentence,  including any  . required  to be  
considered under  [S]ection  3592." 18 U.S.C. 3593(c).  At the 
conclusion of a capital penalty hearing, the jury is  obligated  to  
"return  special  findings  identifying  any aggravating factor or 
factors set forth in [S]ection 3592 found to exist and any other 
aggravating factor for which notice has been provided under 
[Section 3593 (a)]  found to exist. n In the event that  "an  
aggravating  factor  required  to  be  considered under [S]ection 
3592(c) is found to exist, n the jury is then obligated to "consider 
whether all the aggravating factor or factors found to exist"  
sufficiently outweigh any mitigating  factors  so as  to justify the 
imposition of a sentence of death. 
 
In view of this comprehensive capital sentencing scheme that 
unambiguously recognizes the role of non-statutory aggravating 
factors at every stage of the proceedings, Section 3591 (a) cannot 
carry the weight that defendants give it.  Read in the context of the 
statutory scheme, Section 3591 (a)'s reference to "the factors set 
forth in section 3592" does not bar consideration of non-statutory 
aggravating factors, but instead requires consideration of all factors 
authorized under Section 3592: statutory aggravating factors, non-
statutory aggravating factors, and mitigating factors, including 
mitigating factors asserted under 18 U.S.C. 3592(a) (8)'s "catch-
all" provision that is the functional counterpart to Section 3592(c)'s 
"catch-all" provision for non- statutory aggravating factors. Simply 
put, because capital sentencing statutes must permit unrestricted 
consideration of mitigating factors, Congress could not have 
intended Section 3591(a)'s language to be limited to statutory 
aggravating factors.   
 
The legislative history also shows Congress' clear intent to 
authorize reliance on non-statutory aggravating factors. 
Congressional proponents and opponents of the death penalty alike 
understood the provisions in the 1994 crime bill permitting 
consideration of "any other aggravating factor for which notice has 
been given" as authorizing the use of non-statutory aggravating 
factors. Hence, Rep. Watt, a death penalty opponent, sought to 
delete from the capital sentencing provisions of the crime bill all 
references to "other factors." See 140 Cong. Rec. H2339 (Apr. 14, 
1994) . Noting that the existing provisions in the crime bill (which 
later became law) permitted "the prosecuting attorney [to] specify 
whatever other aggravating factors he or she wishes to specify" in 
addition to those aggravating factors specifically listed in the 
statute, Rep. Watt stated that his proposed amendment would 
"limit the prosecutor to the aggravating factors which are specified  
in the  bill."  Ibid.  See  also, id.  at  H2339-H2340 (remarks of 
Rep. Hughes); id. at H2340 (remarks of Rep. Schumer).  
 
Rep. McCollum, a leading supporter of the death penalty, likewise 
understood that the Watt Amendment would remove from the 
crime bill "a catch-all" provision that enabled prosecutors "to 
frame and craft additional aggravating factors that might warrant 
the death penalty." Id. at H2340. Because Congress "co[uld] not 
think of . . . every possible contingency or for every possible type 
of case where the death penalty is warranted," Rep. McCollum 
stated that it was "constitutionally correct" to "leave the discretion 
in the hands of the prosecutors to look on each death penalty case 
on a case-by-case basis" and "craft an appropriate aggravating 
factor or two" in addition to those enumerated by statute. Id. at 
H2339. Without such a provision for non-statutory aggravating 
factors, Rep. McCollum cautioned that there was "the potential for 
grave injustice for [the] death penalty perhaps not being imposed 
in a case that has circumstances that are unusual or peculiar to it." 
Ibid. Rep. McCollum's view prevailed, and the watt Amendment to 
bar reliance on non-statutory aggravating factors was soundly 
defeated.  Id. at H2340-H2341.  The plain language of the statute 
and its legislative history defeat defendants' claim.  
 
B.  Congress Did Not Unconstitutionally Delegate Its Legislative 
Authority By Allowing Prosecutors To Rely on  Authority On 
Non-Statutory Aggravating Factors 
Equally unavailing is defendants' claim (DE 454, pp. 37-39; DE   
455 p. 31) that allowing non-statutory aggravating factors  
constitutes an unconstitutional delegation of legislative  [T] he 
[federal] sentencing function long has been a peculiarly shared 
responsibility among the Branches of Government and has never 
been thought of as the exclusive province of any one Branch."  
Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 390  (1989). Without 
doubt, Congress has the constitutional authority to define federal 
crimes and prescribe the quantum of punishment. Id. at 364.  
Congress exercised that authority when it enacted the various 
offenses contained in Sections 2332a, 844(f)), and 1114 and 
provided a range of penalties for their violation that includes the 
death penalty. Moreover,  as a judge-made rule,  in enacting capital 
penalty provisions, Congress is obligated to specify "statutory 
aggravating circumstances .  .  .  [that] circumscribe the class of 
persons eligible for the death penalty."  Zant, 462 U.S. at 878. 
This,  too,  Congress did when it enacted a penalty scheme that 
narrowed the class of death eligible defendants. 
 
Apart  from  these  constitutionally  necessary  legislative 
functions, "the Constitution does not require the jury to ignore 
other possible aggravating factors in the process of selecting, from 
among that class,  those defendants who will actually be sentenced 
to death."  Ibid.  To the contrary, "as long as th[e] information  
[supporting a non-statutory aggravating factor]  is relevant to the 
character of the defendant or the circumstances of the crime," 
consideration of non-statutory aggravating factors serves the useful 
purpose -- much like the consideration of non- statutory mitigating 
circumstances -- of ensuring an individualized sentencing 
determination that minimizes the risk of arbitrary and capricious  
action. Barclay,  463  U.S.  at  967  (Stevens,  J.,  concurring).  See 
also, Simmons v. South Carolina, 114 S Ct. 2187, 2193-2194 
(1994)~ Payne, 501 U.S. at 820-827 Zant, 462 U.S. at 875.  
"Although the Supreme Court has not required legislatures to 
permit jury consideration of all relevant aggravating factors in 
pursuing individualized sentencing, it clearly favors procedures 
that do 'not * * * impose unnecessary restrictions on the evidence 
that can be offered at [a capital] sentencing hearing'" because it is 
"'desirable for the jury to have as much information before it as 
possible when it makes the sentencing decision Pitera, 795 F. 
Supp. at 561, quoting, Gregg, 428 U.S. at 203-04. 
 
Federal prosecutors have traditionally had authority to bring to the 
sentencer's attention relevant information pertinent to a sentencing 
decision. And, unless expressly prohibited,  federal courts have 
traditionally "considered]  any and all information that might 
reasonably bear on the proper sentence for a particular defendant, 
given the crime committed."  Wasman v. United States, 468 U.S.  
559,  563  (1984).13 Thus,  the role of non-statutory aggravating 
factors in capital sentencing under the instant statute is "virtually 
the same" as the role of sentencing information in non-capital 
cases.  See Pitera, 795 F. Supp. at 562; Cooper, 754 F. Supp. at 
626.  Contrary to defendants' unfounded perception that non-
statutory aggravating factors perform the  constitutionally required 
role of narrowing the class of death-eligible defendants, the  
function  of  the  prosecutor  in  identifying  non-statutory 
aggravating  factors  under  Section  3593(a)  and  proving  their 
existence under Section 3593(c) is "an exercise in advocacy 
derived from the executive's discretion to prosecute, not the 
legislature's power to fix punishment."  Pitera, 795 F.Supp. at 563.  
See also, id. at 562 (because reliance on non-statutory aggravating 
factors "will,  in no small part,  reflect the prosecution's considered 
judgment as to why the case was a 'proper occasion' for serving a 
death penalty notice in the first place," such reliance is "an 
enforcement, not a legislative decision"); Walker, supra, at *11; 
Bradley,  880 F.  Supp. at 284. Because the allowance for non- 
statutory aggravating circumstances in the present capital statute 
involves "no delegation of legislative authority to the prosecutor" 
but simply allows the sentencer the benefit of the full range of 
information pertaining to the offense and the offender (Pitera, 795 
F.  Supp.  at  562),  it  does not  "implicate  the non-delegation 
doctrine."  Bradley, 880 F. Supp. at 284.  See also Walker, supra.   
 
We note that the court in Pretlow, 779 F. Supp. at 765-767, held 
that the provision for non-statutory aggravating factors involved a 
delegation of legislative authority to the Executive Branch.  
Accord, Davis, supra, at *2-3.  Nonetheless, comparing the instant  
"delegation"  with  the  more  extensive  delegation  of authority to 
fix sentences that was approved in Mistretta, the court  in Pretlow 
found that the Executive's exercise of this "delegated" authority 
was sufficiently informed by "intelligent principle[s]"  to pass 
constitutional muster. Those principles included (1)  the 
requirement that such factors be substantively limited to the 
circumstances of the crime and  the character of the accused;  (2)  
the availability of judicial review;  and  (3)  the requirement of 
notice.  Id. at 767-768.  See also, Davis, supra; Pitera, 795 F. Supp. 
at 562-563 ("even if this limited exercise of prosecutorial 
discretion were deemed to constitute a legislative delegation, its 
exercise is sufficiently circumscribed, both by the statute  and by  
judicial  review,  to  ensure  against  overbroad application").  
There is thus no support for defendants' contention that Congress 
impermissibly delegated its authority by allowing prosecutors to 
rely on non-statutory aggravating factors.  
 
C.  The Reliance On Non-Statutory Aggravating Factors Does Not 
Violate The Ex Post Facto Clause 
McVeigh next argues  (DE 454,  p.  39)  that Section 3592(c) 
violates the Ex Post Facto Clause by allowing non-statutory factors 
that are "applied retroactively to crimes committed before the 
aggravating circumstance is identified."  As the Supreme Court has 
made clear, however, the Ex Post Facto Clause is implicated only 
by "laws  that  'retroactively  alter  the  definition  of  crimes  or 
increase the punishment for criminal acts.'"  California Dept. of 
corrections v.  Morales,  115 S.  Ct.  1597,  1601  (1995),  quoting 
Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U.S. 37, 43 (1990).  Accord, Hatch v. 
State of Oklahoma,  58 F.3d 1447,  1463-1464  (lOth Cir.  1995). 
Aggravating factors, whether statutory or non-statutory in nature, 
"are not separate penalties or offenses" (Walton, 497 U.S. at 648) 
or "'elements' of any offense" (Jeffers, 497 U.S. at 782).  Rather, 
"the definition of [the] crimes" and the punishments available for 
40  
the offenses with which defendants are charged are contained in 
the various capital homicide statutes that were in existence at the 
time that the Murrah Federal Building was bombed.   
 
In Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U.S. 282, 293-294 (1977), the Court 
held that ex post facto safeguards are not triggered by procedural 
changes in a capital sentencing scheme that "simply alter the 
methods  in determining whether  the death penalty  [is]  to be 
imposed," but "effect[]  no change in the quantum of punishment 
attached to the crime" or the definition of the crime itself. Accord  
Hatch, 58 F.3d at 1463-1464; Evans v. Thompson, 881 F.2d 117, 
119-121 (4th Cir. 1989), cert. denied 497 U.S. 1010 (1990). 
Consistent with this principle, courts have held that the adoption of 
aggravating factors constitutes a procedural change in the method 
of determining whether a death sentence should be imposed, rather 
than a substantive change in the law respecting crimes and 
punishments, and, hence, that the retroactive application of such 
factors does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.  See Francis v. 
Dugger, 908 F.2d 696, 704 (llth Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 
910 (1991); Jordon v. Walker, 681 F.2d 1067, 1079 (5th Cir. 
1982); Irving v. State, 441 So.2d 846, 852-853 (Miss. 1983), cert. 
denied, 470 U.S. 1059 (1985); State v. Coleman, 605 P.2d 1000, 
1012-1015 (Mont. 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 970 (1980).  
Reliance on non- statutory aggravating factors is similarly proper 
under the Ex Post Facto Clause.  See Bradley, 880 F. Supp. at 284; 
Pitera, 795 F. SUPP. at 563-564.  
 
D.  Comparative Proportionality Review Is Not Required Merely 
Because Prosecutors Are Permitted To Rely Upon Non-Statutory 
Aggravating Factors 
McVeigh  alternatively  contends  (DE  454,  pp.  40-42)  that 
comparative proportionality review of any resulting death sentence 
is mandated, especially because the federal death penalty statute 
creates a "weighing" scheme.  Proportionality review, however, is 
required neither by the Constitution (see Pulley v. Harris, 465 U.S. 
37 (1984)) nor by federal statute.  See Bradley, 880 F. Supp. at 
284; Pretlow, 779 F. Supp. at 763 n. 2; Cooper, 754 F. Supp. at 
626; see also, Walker, supra, at *12 (comparative proportionality 
review permissible, but not mandated by statute);  Pitera, 795 F. 
Supp. at 567 (same). 
 
Contrary to McVeigh's claim, Zant, 462 U.S. at 879-880, 890, 
"does not compel a rule of mandatory proportionality [review] n 
whenever a statutory scheme permits consideration of non-
statutory aggravating factors.  See Walker, supra, at *12.  The 
Supreme Court made that precise point in Pulley v. Harris:  "[W]e 
did not hold  [in Zant]  that without comparative proportionality 
review the statute would be unconstitutional. To the contrary, we 
relied on the jury's finding of aggravating circumstances, not [on 
an appellate  court's] finding  of  proportionality,  as rationalizing 
the sentence.  Thus, the emphasis was on the constitutionally 
necessary narrowing function of statutory aggravating 
circumstances. Proportionality review was considered to be an 
additional safeguard against  arbitrarily  imposed death sentences,  
but  we certainly did not  hold that  comparative  review was 
constitutionally required." 465 U.S. at 50 (internal citations and 
footnote omitted). As we have  shown  above,  Section  3595  
ensures  that  federal  capital defendants will receive meaningful 
appellate review of their death sentences.  Zant  requires no more.  
See Walker, supra; Bradley, 880 F. Supp. at 284, Pitera, 795 F. 
Supp. at 559.   
 
E.  The Non-Statutory Aggravating Factor That Defendants Caused 
The Multiple Deaths of 169 Persons Is Valid 
Defendants contend (DE 454, pp. 44-45i DE 455, p. 27 n. 7) that 
the "multiple deaths" factor is unconstitutional because it fails to 
narrow the class of death-eligible defendants. This argument  
ignores the distinction between statutory aggravating factors that 
narrow death eligibility and non-statutory aggravating factors that 
aid the sentencer in determining whether a death- eligible 
defendant should be sentenced to death. "Eligibility" factors "play 
a constitutionally necessary function at the stage of the legislative 
definition: they circumscribe the class of persons eligible for the 
death penalty." Zant,  462 U.S.  at 878. In contrast, "selection" 
factors -- those factors that "determine[] whether a defendant 
eligible for the death penalty should in fact receive that sentence" -
- do not serve a narrowing function but instead allow "an 
individualized determination on the basis of the character of the 
individual and the circumstances of the crime." Tuilaepa, 114 S.Ct. 
at 2635, quoting Zant, 462 U.S. at 879.  See Simmons, 114 S. Ct. 
at 2193-2194; California v. Ramos, 463 U.S. 992,  1008  (1983);  
Barclay,  463  U.S.  at  967  (Stevens,  J., concurring).  Once the 
class of death-eligible defendants has been narrowed, the role of 
non-statutory aggravating factors in capital sentencing under the 
federal statutory scheme is "virtually the same" as the role of 
sentencing information in non-capital cases. See Pitera, 795 F. 
Supp. at 562, Cooper, 754 F. Supp. at 626.  
 
Under the instant capital sentencing scheme, the statutory 
aggravating factors listed in Section 3592(c)(  -(15) "involve[] a 
congressional narrowing of the class of persons eligible for the 
death penalty."  See Pitera, 795 F. Supp. at 559 (describing role of 
similar aggravating factors in 21 U.S.C. 848(n)(1)-(12)).  By 
contrast,  the non-statutory aggravating factors permitted under 
Section 3592(c) serve to "inform a jury's individualized sentencing 
decision." Ibid.  Thus, their constitutionally-permissible purpose is 
to ensure that the jury might consider "all relevant evidence" that 
"will assist [it] in making an individualized determination whether 
the defendant will be executed, n and not, as defendants would 
have it,  to further narrow the already narrowed class of death-
eligible defendants.  See Bradley, 880 F. Supp. at 285. 
 
The instant federal death penalty statute does not treat the 
commission of multiple homicides as a statutory aggravating 
factor. Nonetheless,  the fact that a defendant has committed 
multiple homicides is both a narrowing circumstance, in that it 
"appl[ies] only to a subclass of defendants" who have committed a 
capital crime  (Tuilaepa,  114 S. Ct. at 2635),  and highly relevant 
to a meaningful assessment of a  "defendant's moral culpability and 
blameworthiness," in that it permits consideration of "the specific 
harm caused by [a] defendant."  Payne, 501 U.S. at 825.  See 
Pulley v. Harris, 465 U.S. at 51-54 & n. 14 (upholding validity of 
capital sentencing scheme that relied on the commission of 
multiple murders as a statutory special circumstance); Pitera, 795 
F. Supp. 571, 577 (E.D.N.Y. 1992) (Pitera II) ("Since the 
government remains free to proffer  evidence  of  additional  
homicides  as  non-statutory aggravating factors, the court's ruling 
[precluding use of multiple homicides as a statutory aggravating 
factor]  in no way limits individualized sentencing"). 
 
Defendants'  additional argument that the  "multiple deaths" factor 
impermissibly duplicates the "if death results" element of the 
charged offenses must also be rejected.  Although Counts One, 
Two, and Three allege that the defendants' criminal conduct caused 
the deaths of more than 160 persons, a capital conviction on any of 
those counts merely requires that the jury find beyond a reasonable 
doubt  that  the  death  of  a  single  person  resulted  from  the 
defendants' commission of the offense.  Likewise, with respect to 
the eight first degree murder counts, the jury must find that the 
single victim identified in each separate count was murdered by the 
defendants.  Thus, it is only through the non-statutory aggravating 
factor pertaining to "multiple deaths" that the jury will be able to 
account for the true extent of human carnage caused by the 
defendants.  Moreover, even if the defendants are correct that the 
"multiple deaths" factor duplicates an offense element, Lowenfield 
permits such a result.  See supra, pp. 17-21.14  
 
F.  The Non-Statutory Aggravating Factor That Defendants Caused 
Serious Physical and Emotional Injuries Is Valid 
There is no merit to McVeigh's contention (DE 454, pp. 44-45) 
that the factor pertaining to the infliction of "serious physical and 
emotional injuries" is unconstitutionally vague.  It is well 
recognized that an offender's infliction of serious,  non-fatal 
injuries  on a  crime  victim  is  a  factor  that  aggravates  the 
seriousness of the offense, 15 and similar terms have been readily 
susceptible to definition. 16 Courts have consistently rejected 
claims that such terms are unconstitutionally vague.  See United 
States v.  Williams,  51 F.3d 1004,  l009-1010  (llth Cir.  1995); 
United States v. Fitzgerald, 882 F.2d 397, 398  (9th Cir. 1989); 
United States v. Protex Industries. Inc., 874 F.2d 740, 743 (lOth 
Cir. 1989).  As the court in Williams, 51 F.3d at 1010, stated in  
rejecting a void-for-vagueness  challenge  to  the  enhancement 
provision in the carjacking statute, 18 U.S.(  2119, for offenses 
resulting in "serious bodily injury":  "The fact that the statute 
'exposed  defendants  to  enhanced  penalties  based  on  legally 
significant factors does not make the statute void for vagueness."'  
The  instant  non-statutory  aggravating  factor  alleges  a 
traditional  sentencing  consideration  in  terms  that  possess  a 
"common-sense core of meaning" that a jury "should be capable of 
understanding." Tuilaepa,  114  S.  Ct.  at  2636. That  is 
particularly  true  since the factor identifies "maiming, 
disfigurement, and permanent disability"' as illustrative of the 
seriousness of the injuries to which it speaks.  Providing, as it does,  
"meaningful guidance to the sentencer, in the factor is not void for 
vagueness.  Cf. Walton, 497 U.S. at 654-655 (aggravating factor 
that required sentencer to determine whether "perpetrator 
inflict[ed] mental anguish or physical abuse before the victim's 
death's was not unconstitutionally vague). And,  "[i]f  further 
clarification  is  needed,  the  defendants  can  suggest  a  "jury 
instruction" at the appropriate time.  Davis, supra, at *2.  
 
G.  The Non-Statutory Aggravating Factor Engaged In Acts of 
Burglary Robbery and Theft to Facilitate The Charged Capital 
Offenses is Valid 
McVeigh contends  (DE 454,  pp.  45-47)  that the  "burglary, 
robbery, and theft" factor is constitutionally deficient because it 
relies on unadjudicated criminal conduct.  He is incorrect. 
 
The '"burglary, robbery, and theft" factor is constitutionally  
valid, as its existence "is relevant to [both] the character of the 
defendant [s] and the circumstances of the crime [s] ." Barclay, 463 
U.S. at 967 (Stevens, J., concurring); see also, Zant, 462 U.S. at 
878-879; Gregg, 428 U.S. at 189. Unlike extraneous criminal 
conduct, the "acts of burglary, robbery, and theft" cited in the death 
penalty notices were relied upon by defendants to "finance and 
otherwise facilitate the commission of the capital offense(s) 
charged in the indictment," and, for that reason, are circumstances 
that directly bear on defendants' bombing attack on the Murrah 
Federal Building. Moreover, the fact that the defendants resorted to 
"acts of burglary, robbery, and theft" to aid their eventual deadly 
bombing attack makes defendants more death-worthy than a killer 
who has never before caused or committed another criminal act, 
much less acts as serious as burglary and armed robbery. That 
being so, the fact that Congress has elected to treat some aspects of 
a capital defendant's criminal past as statutory aggravating factors 
that narrow the class of death-eligible defendants, does not 
preclude consideration of other aspects of a capital defendant's 
criminal history as selection factors to assist the sentencer in 
making an individual determination whether the death penalty is 
justified. See Bradley, 880 F. Supp. at 286.   
 
McVeigh's further claim (DE 454, pp. 46-47) that unadjudicated 
criminal conduct may not be considered during capital sentencing 
hearings is foreclosed by the Supreme Court's decision in Williams 
v. New York, 337 U.S. 241 (1949), and the Tenth Circuit's recent 
decision in Hatch, 58 F.3d at 1465-1466.  Contrary to McVeigh's 
assertion that "the Supreme Court has yet to resolve the 48 
constitutionality  of  admitting  unadjudicated  offenses  during the  
Court  lid  just  that  in capital  sentencing  proceedings, Williams. 
See also, Nichols v. United States, 114 S. Ct. 1921, 1928 (1994) 
("Sentencing courts have . . . considered a defendant's past criminal 
behavior, even if no conviction resulted from that behavior.  We 
have upheld the constitutionality of considering such conduct in 
Williams"); Payne, 501 U.S. at 820-821 (citing Williams for 
propositions that "the sentencing authority has always been free to 
consider a wide range of relevant material") In Hatch the Tenth 
Circuit expressly "follow[ed] Williams and join[ed] three other 
Circuit Courts in holding that the admission of evidence of 
unadjudicated offenses at a [capital] sentencing proceeding does 
not violate due process."  58 F.3d at 1465 (collecting cases).  See 
also, Bradley, 880 F. Supp. at 286-287 (approving consideration of 
unadjudicated conduct  as  a statutory aggravating  factor); Pitera 
II, 795 F. Supp. at 577 (same). 
 
H.  The Non-Statutory Aggravating Factor Pertaining To Victim 
Impact Is Valid 
The government's death penalty notices allege that, as a non- 
statutory aggravating factor,  "victim impact evidence" will be 
presented "concerning the effect of the defendant[s'] offense(s) on 
the victims and the victims' families. n McVeigh's argument that 
the "victim impact" factor is impermissible  (DE 454, p. 47)  is 
foreclosed by Payne, 501 U.S. at 827, which held that the Eighth 
Amendment permits consideration of "evidence about the victim 
and about  the  impact  of  the  murder  on  the  victim's  family"  in 
determining "whether or not the death penalty should be imposed. 
 
In line with Payne, Congress has expressly determined that victim 
impact  is  a  relevant  sentencing  factor  in  federal  capital 
proceedings.  18 U.S.C. 3S93(a)(2) .17 
 
CONCLUSION   
For the  above  reason,  defendants'  motions  to strike  the 
government's notices of its intention to seek the death penalty 
should be denied.

l  In Gregg, the statute required state appellate courts to determine 
n [w]hether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence 
of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor[;] .  .  .  
[w]hether .  .  . the evidence supports the  [sentencer's] finding of a 
statutory aggravating circumstance  .  .  .[;]  and [w]hether the 
sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty 
imposed in similar cases."  Ibid.  As described below, the instant 
review provisions are virtually identical to those in the Georgia 
statute, with the exception of Georgia's allowance for 
proportionality review, which is not constitutionally required. See 
Pulley v. Harris, 465 U.S. 37, 50-51 (1984).  
 
2  In light of McClesky, Mcveigh is plainly wrong(DE 454, p. 15) 
in reading Justice White's concurring opinion in Gregg as leaving 
open the possibility that the "standardless" prosecutorial discretion 
in determining whether the death penalty should be sought is 
subject to judicial review. 
 
3  3 Nichols'  attempt to extrapolate such a rule  from the holdings 
in Smith v. United States, 360 U.S. 1 (1959), and Sumner  v. 
Shuman, 483 U.S. 66  (1987), is far wide of the mark. Smith  
stands for the unremarkable proposition that a prosecution for an  
offense potentially punishable by death must be initiated by means  
of an indictment, even if the government does not intend to seek  
the death penalty upon conviction.  Shuman stands for the equally  
unremarkable proposition that a capital sentencing scheme 
mandating  a death sentence automatically upon conviction 
violates the Eighth  Amendment by foreclosing consideration of 
potentially mitigating  circumstances. Neither decision addresses 
whether aggravating  factors must be alleged in the indictment.  
Smith does, however,  support our position that it is for the 
government to determine  whether to seek the death penalty for 
capital crimes.  
 
Moreover,  as  criminal  forfeitures  must  be  alleged  in 
indictments by express operation of federal procedural rules, the  
decision in United States v. Seifuddin, 820 F.2d 1074, 1078 (9th  
Cir. 1987), on which Nichols relies, is irrelevant to the issue  
whether an indictment charging a capital offense must additionally  
allege, as a constitutional matter, the aggravating factors that  will 
later be relied upon to justify a sentence of death. 
 
4  Nichols  complains  (DE  455,  p.  21)  that  the  notices 
improperly allege "all the intent elements of  3591, without a  hint 
of which element the government will rely upon at trial. n The  
government  is  not  limited  to  reliance  on  a  single  mental  
culpability factor in establishing that death is a constitutionally  
proportionate punishment for a particular defendant.  See Flores,  
63 F.3d at 1370-1373 (affirming finding as to existence of multiple  
mental culpability factors).  McVeigh is also wrong (DE 454, pp.  
12-13 ) in arguing that the jury could give duplicative weight to  
multiple  mental  culpability  factors  in  the  event  that  the  
government is not required to elect a single factor for submission  
to the jury.  Unlike the capital sentencing scheme in Title 21, in  
which the mental culpability factors are treated as aggravating  
factors and are weighted by the jury  (see Flores,  supra),  the  
instant capital sentencing scheme does not categorize the mental 
culpability  factors  as  "aggravating  factors"  (see  18  U.S.C. 
3592(c)),  and the jury is permitted to weigh only aggravating  
factors "set forth in section 3592" and "any other" aggravating  
factors for which notice has been given. Consistent with the  
applicable capital sentencing scheme, our death penalty notices  
identify the mental culpability factors alleged as "preliminary  
factors, n but not as "aggravating factors." 
 
5  Defendants correctly note that such duplicative use of offense 
elements was held to be improper in State v. Middlebrooks,  840 
S.W.2d 317  (Tenn.  1992),  cert.  dismissed,  114 S.  Ct.  651  
(1993),  and State v. Cherry,  257 S.E.2d 551 (N.C.  1979), cert.  
denied, 446 U.S. 941 (1980).  These cases have not been followed 
by  the federal courts.  See Deputy v. Taylor, 19 F.3d at 1500-
1502;  Snell v. Lockhart, 14 F.3d at 1305.  
 
6  United States v. Cheely, 36 F.3d 1439 (9th Cir. 1994), is not to 
the contrary.  In Cheely, a prosecution that predated the enactment 
of 18 U.S.C. 3591, et seq., the Ninth Circuit held that  the capital 
penalty provisions applicable to the mail bomb offenses  in  18  
U.S.C.  844(d)  and 1716 were constitutionally defective  because  
they  did  not  limit  the  category  of  death-eligible  defendants to 
those who actually intended to kill.  36 F.3d at 1445  & n. 15.  
Unlike in Cheely, the instant capital sentencing statute  requires a 
threshold finding that a capital defendant intended to  kill (18 
U.S.C. 3591(a)) and further provides detailed procedures  for 
channeling the jury's discretion.  
 
7  The legislative history of the federal death penalty statute and its 
"weapons of mass destruction" provision buttresses  this 
conclusion. Before their ultimate adoption as part of the  Violent 
Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-  
322  (Sept.  13,  1994),  Congress repeatedly considered bills  
containing "weapons of mass destruction" provisions whose 
offense  language was identical to that adopted in Section 2332a 
and capital  sentencing provisions that relied upon the commission 
of a "weapons  of mass destruction" offense as an aggravating 
factor; however,  these bills often varied in their placement of such 
identically-  worded "weapons of mass destruction" provisions 
within Title 18's  "terrorism" chapter, with some bills placing the 
offense a in  newly-created section "2339"  (See 139 Cong. Rec. 
H10230 (Nov. 19,  1993); 137 Cong. Rec. H7950 (Oct. 16, 1991); 
137 Cong. Rec. S9991  (July 15, 1991)) and others placing it in a 
newly-created section  "2339A" (see 139 Cong. Rec. S10407 (Aug. 
4, 1993); 139 Cong. Rec.  S296 (Jan. 21, 1993); 138 Cong. Rec. 
S2690 (Mar. 3, 1992)).  This  history reveals both the consistency 
of Congress' purpose to treat  the "weapons of mass destruction" 
offense that now is codified as  Section 2332a as a statutory 
aggravating factor and the likely  reason for Congress' miscitation 
to a non-existence "section 2339." 25  
 
8  As the Court observed in Tuilaepa, in the post-Furman era, it has 
found only a few sentencing factors to be unconstitutionally  
vague, primarily those involving pejorative adjectives describing  
the capital crime as a whole. 114 S.Ct. at 2636. See. e.q.,  Maynard 
v. Cartwright, 486 U.S. 356, 363-364 (1988) (whether murder  was 
"especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel"); Godfrey v. Georgia,  446 
U.S. 420, 427-429 (1980)  (whether murder was "outrageously or  
wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman").  Sentencing considerations  
of this nature are not at issue here.  Compare Proffitt, 428 U.S.  at 
255-258 (phrase "conscienceless or pitiless crime which [wa]s  
unnecessarily torturous  to  the victim"  not unconstitutionally  
vague); Arave v. Creech, 113 S.Ct. at 1543 (phrase "utter disregard  
for human life" not unconstitutional when narrowed to mean a 
"cold-  blooded, pitiless slayer"). 
 
9  McVeigh attempts to distinguish Flores on the ground that the 
Title 21 capital sentencing scheme requires proof of two  
aggravating factors, while the Title 18 capital sentencing scheme  
only requires proof of one aggravating factor.  DE 454, p. 31 n.  
25.  Whether the Title 21 procedures require a greater degree of  
narrowing is irrelevant to the question whether the "substantial  
planning and premeditation"  factor is sufficiently definite in  
meaning to pass constitutional muster. Moreover,  the  second  
aggravating factor that must be found under the Title 21 capital  
sentencing scheme replicates exactly the mental culpability finding  
that must be preliminarily made under 18 U.S.C. 3591(a)(2). 
 
10  Nor is there merit to Nichols' contention that the term n 
terrorism" makes the aggravator vague. Defendants are charged  
with violating the weapons of mass destruction statute, 18 U.S.C.  
2332a,  which is contained in the chapter of the criminal code  
entitled "Terrorism," and the terms "international terrorism" (18  
U.S.C. 2331(1)) and "act of terrorism" (18 U.S.C. 3077) are further  
defined in Title 18. 
 
1l  The regulation was issued by the Attorney General on May 18,  
1994. The death penalty provisions of the Violent Crime Control 
and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 were enacted into law on 
September 13, 1994. See Pub. L. 103-322, Title VI,  60002(a).  
McVeigh is wrong in stating that the regulation was promulgated 
after the enactment of the death penalty statute and in suggesting 
that it was meant to expand the scope of Section 3592(c)(14). 
 
12  Defendant McVeigh also complains about a lack of notice 
concerning the identities of the homicide victims who qualify as 
"law enforcement officers" under Section 3592(c)(14).  Although 
his lack-of-notice complaint does not go to the constitutional 
validity of Section 3592(c)(14),  we note that the eight murder 
victims listed in Counts Four through Eleven are includable, as all 
eight murder victims are identified as  "special agents"  employed 
by specific law enforcement agencies and are alleged to have been 
killed "while they were engaged in or on account of the 
performance of their official duties as law enforcement officers. 
 
13  See Roberts v. United States, 445 U.S. 552, 556 (1980); United 
States v. Grayson, 438 U.S. 41, 45-50 (1978); United States v. 
Tucker, 404 U.S. 443, 446 (1972); Williams v. New York, 337 
U.S. 241, 247 (1949). 
 
14  In like vein, defendants argue (DE 454, pp. 44-47; DE 455, p. 
27 n. 7) that the three other non-statutory aggravating factors 
alleged in the death penalty notices are unconstitutional because 
they also fail to narrow the class of death-eligible defendants and 
duplicate  matters  charged  in  the  indictment. Defendants' 
"narrowing"  and  "duplication"  challenges  to  these  other non-
statutory aggravating factors must fail for the reasons that their 
challenges to the "multiple deaths" factor fail: non-statutory 
aggravating factors need not further narrow the already narrowed 
class of death-eligible defendants, and Lowenfield makes clear that 
aggravating factors may permissibly duplicate matters alleged in 
the indictment. 
 
15  See, e.q., 18 U.S.C. lll(b)  ("bodily injury"); 18 U.S.C. 
113(a)(6)  &  (7) ("resulting  in  serious  bodily  injury"  or  
"substantial bodily injury");  18 U.S.C.  2119  ("serious bodily  
injury"); U.S.S.G. Guidelines Manual  2A2.1(b)  ("permanent or  
life-threatening bodily injury" or in "serious bodily injury"); i .  at 
2A2.2  (same)i  i .  at 2A4.1  (same);  id.  at 5K2.2  ("insignificant 
physical injury"); id. at  5K2.3  (sychological  injury  much  more  
serious  than  normally  resulting  from  the  commission of the 
offense"). 
 
16  See, e.q., 18 U.S.C. 113(b)  (defining "substantial bodily 
injury"  and  "serious  bodily  injury");  18  U.S.C.  1365(g)(3) 
(defining "serious bodily injury"); U.S.S.C. Guidelines Manual 
lA1.1, Commentary, Note l(h) & (j)  (defining "permanent or life-  
threatening bodily injury" and "serious bodily injury").  See also  
United States v. Talamante, 981 F.2d 1153, 1158 & n. 8 (lOth Cir.  
1992)  (favorably citing jury instruction that "was identical, in  
pertinent part, to the guideline definition of permanent or life-  
threatening injury[]  and included obvious disfigurement as an  
example of serious injury"), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 1876 (1993). 
 
17  In addition, Nichols is wrong in asserting (DE 455, p. 27 n.  7)  
that the "victim impact"  factor duplicates the "serious  physical 
and emotional injury" factor.  The "victim impact" factor  focuses 
on "each [homicide] victim's 'uniqueness as an individual  human 
being' . . . whose death represents a unique loss to society  and in 
particular to his family."  Payne, 501 U.S. at 823, 825.  By  
contrast,  the  "serious  physical  and emotional  injury"  factor  
focuses on the serious, albeit non-fatal,  injuries sustained by  
many of those who survived the deadly bombing.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE 


AFFIDAVIT 
I, HENRY C. GIBBONS, being duly sworn, Hereby state that I am 
an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, having been so 
employed for 26 years and as such am vested with the authority 
toinvestigate violations of federal laws, inciuding Title 18, United 
States Code, Section 844(f) This affidavit  is  submitted  in support 
of a search warrant for a 1977 yellow Mercury Marquis in the 
pcssession of the Federal Bureau of Investigation(FBI). 
Further, Affiant states: 
1.   The following information was received by the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation during the period Apri' 19, 1995 to May 4, 1995. 
2.   On April 19, 1995, a powerful exploslve device detonated in 
front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, 
Oklahoma, at approximately 9:00 a.m.  Among the many people 
killed by the bombing are employees of the numerous federal 
agencies which had offices in the building..    
3.  Investigation by Federal agents at the scene of the explosion has 
determined that the explosive was contained in a 1993 Ford truck 
owned by Ryder Rental Company. 
a.  A partial vehicle identification number (VIN) was found at the 
scene of the explosion and determined to be from a part of the 
truck that contained the explosive device.  57/5/45 
B.  The Vin which was completely  redonstructed was traced back 
to a truck owned by Ryder Rentals of Miami, Florida. 
c.  Ryder Rentals informed the FBI that the truck was assigned to a 
rental company known as Elliot's Body Shop in Junction City 
Kansas. 
4.  The rental agent at Elliot's Body Shop in Junction City_was 
intervied by the FBI_ on April 19,  1995, and advised that two 
persons had rented the truck on April 17, 1995. The  individual  
who  signed  the  rental  agreement  provided  the following 
informatlon: 
a. the person who signed the rental agreement identified himself as 
Bob Kling, SSAN 962-42-9694, South Dakota driver's license 
number YF942A6, and provided a home  address  of  428  Maple  
Drive,  Omaha,  Nebraska, telephone 913-238-2425.  The person 
listed the destination as 428 Maple Drive, Redfield, South Dakota. 
b.  Subsequent investigation conducted by the F3I determined all 
that information to be false.  
5.   An employee of Elliot's Body Shop in Junction City, Kansas, 
identified Timothy McVeigh from a photographic array as the 
person who rented a Ryder truck on April 17, 1995, and signed the 
rental agreement. 
6.   An employee of the Dreamland Motel in Junction City, Kansas,  
identified Timothy McVeigh as a guest at the motel from April 14, 
1995, through April 18, 1995.  This employee, when shown a  
photo  lineup  identified  Timothy McVeigh's  picture  as  the 
individual who registered at the motel under the name of Tim 
McVeigh,  listed his automobile as a Mercury bearing an Arizona 
license plate, and provided a Michigan  address, onNorthVan Dyke 
in Decker Michigan. 
7.   On  April 17, 1995,  Timothy  James McVeigh  was arrested in 
Noble County, Oklahoma, on traffic and weapons offenses and  
was  thereafter incarcerated  on those charges  in  Perry, Oklahoma.   
McVeigh's arrest occurred approximately 60-70 mi1es north o 
Oklahoma City,  Oklahoma,  approximately 1 hour and 2o minutes 
after the April 19, 1995, explosion that damaged the Alfred P. 
Murrah Federal Building.  At the time of his arrest, McVeigh was 
driving a 1977 yellow Mercury Marquis.  
8.   On Ap-il 21, 1995, a criminal complaint was filed charging 
Timothy James McVeigh with a violation of 18 U.S.C.   844 f)  
based on his  involvement of the bombing of  the Murrah Federal 
Building. Later that day, McVeigh was taken into federal custody.  
9.   On April 27, 1995, a preliminary hearing was held on this 
charge,  evidence was presented and the federal magistrate judge  
found that there was probable cause to believe that an offense had 
been committed and that McVeigh committed it.  
10.  Based on interviews and other evidence developed by the FBI, 
there is reason to believe McVeigh did not act alone in committing 
this offense: 
a.   The employee at Elliot's Body Shop in Junction City, Kansas, 
where the truck subsequently used as the bomb vehicle was rented, 
has advised that the vehicle was picked up by two persons;  
b.  Two witnesses at the scene of the Alfred P Murrah building on 
April  19,  1955, observed a person believed to be Timothy James 
McVeigh with another person departing the area of the Murrah 
Building  shortly before  the bombing.  One of  these witnesses 
observed the person they believed to be Timothy James McVeigh 
leave the area in a yellow or cream-colored Mercury;  
11.  Supervisory Special Agent(SSA) James T. Thurman, Chief,  
Explosives  Unit Washngton, D C , Bomb Data Center, FBI 
Laboratory, advised that: 
a the bomb which detonated in front of the Murrah Federal 
Building on April 13,  19949,  contained a high explosive  main  
charge  initiated  by  as  yet  unknown methods; 
b.   an explosive device of the magnitude which exploded in 
Oklahoma Cily on April 19, 1995, would have been constructed 
over a period of time utilizing a large quantlty of both 
paraphernalia and materials, which may have included, but not 
been limited to, the following: fertilizer,  fuel  oil,  chemicals,  
dynamite,  military explosives,  detonators  (blasting caps),  
electrical or non-electrical fusing systems, wires, batteries, timing 
devices, burning type fuse, mixing and other containers. 
c.   The construction of an explosive device similar to the one 
believed to have caused the damage to the Murrah Building would 
necessarily have involved the efforts of more than one person. ' 
12.  On. April 21,  15,  United States District Judge David L. 
Russell authorized a search warrant for the 1977  Mercury Marquis 
based upon an application and affidavit of the United States   
Among the items located during the course of the search of the 
1977 yellow Mercury Marquis were human hairs of value for 
comparison purposes of more than one person.  
13.  On May 2, 1995, FBI Supervisory Special Agent (SSA) 
Richard S.  Hahn advised affiant that during the course of the 
initial search,  a test for  latent fingerprints utilizing Cyano 
Acrylate was not conducted.   SSA Hahn advised that the Cyano 
Acrylate search procedure can produce latent finger prints of value 
which other tests cannot produce.
14.  A comprehensive forensic processing and examination of the 
vehicle and its contents could reveal hair,  fibers, oil, fuel, soil, 
grass, chemicals and fingerprints which could be used to identify 
the presence of other persons present in the vehicle with Timothy 
James McVeigh and/or the presence of chemicals which could be 
used in the construction of the explosive device, and/or could be 
used to place the vehicle at locations where the explosive device 
may have been constructed,  and/or  could provide  other evidence 
of the relationship of the vehicle and its owner to the explosion in 
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  Moreover, during the course of this 
investigation, evidentiary items, including man-made and natural 
fibers, hairs, cloth, oil, fuel, other compounds, soil and grass have 
been seized from the Dreamland motel room, described paragraph 
6 where McVeigh stayed, and from a location at Geary State 
Fishing Lake, approximately six miles south of Junciton  City, 
Kansas, where witnesses described seeing a Ryder truck parked 
next to a  pickup truck in an unpaved area on April 18, 1995.  The 
pickup truck was described as a 1980-1987 Chevrolet or GMC 
truck, dark blue or brown in color, with possibly a white comper 
shell back.  Terry Nichols, who has admitted that he is an associate 
of  McVeigh,  and who has stated that he loaned his pickup truck to 
McVeigh on April 18, 1995, in Junction City, Kansas, owns a 1984 
GMC blue pick-up truck with a white camper top.  An additional, 
comprehensive processing and examination of the yellow 1977 
Mercury Marquis is needed in order to obtain representative 
samples and quantities capable of analysis for purposes of 
comparison with the items described above.  
15.  Based upon the aforesaid, your affiant believes that probable 
cause exists to believe that the yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis, 
which is currently in FBI custody, is property which has been used 
as a means of committing a violation of Section 844(f) of Title 18, 
United States Code.  Affiant also believes that probable cause 
exists to believe that  the yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis currently 
in FBI custody consists of and contains  items,  both visible and 
latent,  which are evidence of a criminal offense, namely Section 
844(f) of Title 18, United States Code, or which can be compared 
to items seized and identified which are such evidence.  
16.  Based on the aforesaid and Rule 41(b), Federal Rules of 
Criminal Procedure, affiant wishes to seize said vehicle as 
evidence and to examine and process said vehicle and its contents  
Affiant believes  there is a probable cause for law  enforcement 
officials.to conduct laboratory examinations on this vehicle and its  
contents for trace evidence materials to associate the vehicle with 
the bombing of the Alfred P.Murrah Federal Building, the mixing 
of explosives and to link said vehicle to any other coconspirators. 
Further your affiant sayeth not.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

and 
 
TERRY LYNN NICHOLS, 
 
Defendants. 
 
 
No. CR 95-110-A 
 
 
GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSED SEQUESTRATION 
ALTERNATIVES  
 
 
This brief responds to the Court's August 21, 1995 order directing 
that the parties propose measures that may be used in lieu of 
traditional sequestration during the trial of this case.  
 
The United States shares the Court's concern that the jury be 
insulated from extraneous influence, yet spared the hardship of 
lengthy sequestration.  Accordingly, the government proposes that 
the Court consider the following alternatives: (a) empaneling an 
anonymous jury; (b) directing the United States Marshall Service 
to establish measures to protect jurors' identities and outside 
contacts; (c) requiring prospective jurors to agree, in lieu of 
sequestration, to dramatic alteration of their reading, viewing and 
leisure activities; and (d) ordering all persons, including media 
representatives, to avoid any contact with jurors concerning the 
case.  The Court should also make the traditional inquiries and give 
the usual admonitions that the jury avoid outside influences.  
 
If it becomes apparent at any time that these measures will be or 
are insufficient, then the Court can consider sequestration as a last 
resort. In that event,  the United States respectfully suggests that 
this Court consider juror-friendly housing.   
 
I.  MEASURES IN LIEU OF SEQUESTRATION. 
 
a.  Anonymous Jury 
 
A publicly anonymous jury might substantially reduce the risk of 
jury intimidation and contamination. Federal courts have 
repeatedly endorsed the use of anonymous juries in cases 
presenting some combination of a high degree of publicity ;which 
increased the likelihood that jurors' names would become public 
and that they would be subjected to improper contacts), charges 
involving serious violent crimes,  and the prospect of significant 
penalties upon conviction.  E.q., United States v. Edmond, 52 F.3d 
1080, 1091-1094 (D.C. Cir. 1995); United States v. Ross, 33 F.3d 
1507, 1520 (11th  Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115 S.Ct. 2558 (1995); 
United States v. Vario, 943 F.2d 236, 240  (2d Cir. 1991), cert. 
denied,  502 U.S. 1036 (1992); United States v. Shakur, 623 F. 
Supp. 1, 3-4 (S.D.N.Y. 1983).  All these factors are present in this 
highly-publicized case involving a terrorist incident of 
unprecedented violence in which defendants face lengthy prison 
sentences and possibly the death penalty. Selection of anonymous 
jurors would not alter the level playing field because the 
government would be entitled to no more (and no less) information 
about prospective jurors.  
 
If the government ultimately seeks the death penalty, defendants 
may be entitled under 18 U.S.C. Section 3432 to the names and 
"place[s] of abode" of the venirepersons three days before trial. 
The statute is silent concerning disclosure of the list to the 
government, but presumably that disclosure would occur no later 
than three days before trial as well.  
 
Although the apparent purpose of Section 3432 is to provide the 
parties    a capital case an opportunity to investigate the 
background of potential  jurors, the statute does  not  grant 
unqualified access to a venire list.  Indeed, it eliminates any right 
to the list where "the court finds by a preponderance of the 
evidence that providing the list may jeopardize the life or safety of 
any person."  Even if the Court ultimately were to furnish the 
venire list to the parties under section 3432,  nothing in the statute 
precludes a protective order barring the parties from disclosing any 
names on the list to third parties.  See W.D. Ok. Local Rule 
27(H)(5) (Court may issue special order" in "highly publicized" 
cases directing that the names and addressee of jurors or 
prospective jurors not be publicly released except as required by 
statute, and that no photograph be taken or sketch made of any 
juror within the environs of the  Court").[fn 1]  Cf.,  Breechen v. 
Reynolds, 41 F.3d 1343, 1351 (10th Cir. 1994)  (discussing 
Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333 (1966),  where trial court  
failed to provide fair trial because, among other things, it took 
inadequate steps to avoid  "publication of potential juror's names  
and addresses  allowing  the  public  to  contact potential  jurors 
pretrial"), cert. denied, 115 S.Ct. 2564 (1995).  
 
To enable some limited investigation prior to jury selection, the 
Court could fashion a procedure whereby the parties obtained the 
Court's approval ex parte to disclose names on the list to certain 
named people and certified that those people would not further 
disclose the names.  Of course, to protect jurors' privacy and rights 
to be free from harassment or tampering,  any investigation of 
venirepersons beyond discussion with court-approved persons or 
examination of pre-existing records should be conducted solely 
under court supervision.  See 2 Charles Alan Wright, Federal 
Practice and Procedure Criminal Section 382 at 344 (1982) ("the 
impartiality of jurors should be tested under the control of the court 
rather than by the unsupervised activity of investigators with all the 
undesirable possibilities  of intimidation and jury tampering which 
such surveillance inevitably presents") (internal quotations 
omitted); see also id. n.4 ("'In those cases where it appears 
necessary to conduct  a pretrial investigation of the background of 
jurors, investigatory methods of the lawyer should neither harass 
nor unduly embarrass potential jurors or invade their privacy and, 
whenever possible, should be restricted  to  an  investigation  of  
records and  sources  of information already in existence'") 
(quoting 1980 edition of ABA Standards for Criminal Justice).  
 
In empaneling an anonymous jury,  the Court could assign a 
number to each prospective juror, who would be known only by 
that number throughout voir dire and the remainder of trial.  This 
procedure has been successful in other highly publicized criminal 
cases.  Note, Prejudicial Publicity Surrounding a Criminal Trial: 
What a Trial Court Can Do to Ensure a Fair Trial in the Face of a 
"Media Circus", 26 Suffolk U.L.R. 1063, 1076 (1992) (describing 
how "assigned numbers shielded the identities of prospective jurors 
from the press" in federal trial of John DeLorean).  
 
b.  Measures to Protect Juror Privacy and Security.  
 
Obviously, it serves little purpose to empanel an anonymous jury 
without instituting measures to protect the jurors privacy and 
security outside the courthouse . The Marshal's Service is fully 
capable of devising measures to limit outsiders from, learning the 
identities of the jurors. Similarly, the Marshal's Service has well-
established practices to protect jurors from unauthorized outside 
contacts. In light of the media attention focused on this case and 
the many outside interests that might try to influence the verdict, 
the Marshal's Service should employ all necessary measures to 
protect jurors from such contacts. To detail those measures in a 
public pleading, however, would seriously reduce the effectiveness 
of those measures. Accordingly, the government recommends that 
the Marshal's Service  privately  convey  its recommendations to 
the Court regarding juror privacy and security .  
 
c. Jurors' Agreement To Alert Their Activities.  
 
Most jurors presumably would prefer to live at home rather than be 
sequestered. That benefit cannot come without cost. Jurors 
typically are admonished to avoid reading or listening to reports 
about the case.  See, e.g., W.D. Ok. Local Rule 7(H)(3). Here, 
however, that simple admonition may not suffice. Instead, it will 
likely be necessary that jurors agree to avoid all media -- print and 
electronic, including computer -- that might possibly provide 
information about the case.  This requirement would restrict juror's 
access to virtually all commercial television and ratio  because  
news  "teasers" can and regularly do interrupt scheduled 
programming.  
 
This restriction might prevent jurors from watching or listening  to  
commercial  television or  radio, or to visiting establishments 
where televisions or radios are turned on, while restricting them to 
pre-recorded programs and tapes.  It would likely also prevent 
jurors from reading or even picking up any current daily 
newspaper, as the headlines are likely to offer news of the case. 
The Marshal's Service, however, might be able to provide jurors 
daily newspapers or magazines from which articles relating to the 
case have been clipped. It may also be possible to provide taped 
versions of favorite programming or sporting events;, edited to 
guard against any references to the case.  
 
Jurors who could not abide by the necessary restrictions on their 
outside reading, viewing and listening practices, or by an 
admonition not to discuss the case with family and friends, should 
be encouraged to reveal themselves during voir dire so as to avoid 
problems later. Empaneled jurors should understand that they must 
avoid social situations that might lead to discussions of the case. 
To comply with the Court's admonition, some jurors might have no 
alternative but to avoid certain acquaintances or even relatives.  
 
d.  Media and Third Party Restrictions 
 
The  United States does not advocate  ~he constitutionally 
questionable device of imposing restrictions on the media's out-of-
court coverage  of  the crime and trial. Cf. Nebraska Press 
Association v. Stewart, 427 U.S. 539 11976).  Nor does the United 
States advocate at present the imposition of a "gag order" upon 
counsel, investigators or witnesses. Such an order may be 
constitutional if the Court were to find that out-of-court speech was 
substantially likely to interfere with a fair trial. See, e.g., Gentile v. 
State Bar of Nevada, 501 U.S. 1030, 1075 (1991); United States v. 
Cutler, 58 F.3d 825, 835-937 (2d Cir. 1995); Cf. Sheppard v. 
Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 361    66) ("the trial court might well have 
proscribed extrajudicial statements by any lawyer, party, witness, 
or court official which divulged prejudicial matters . . . concerning 
the merits of the cases) (dictum). See also W.D. Ok. Local Rule 27 
(E) (precluding lawyers from making or authorizing public 
statement during trial "if there is a reasonable likelihood that such 
dissemination will interfere with a fair trial, except that the lawyer 
or law firm may quote from or refer without comment to public 
records of the court in the case"). It is clear, however, that third 
parties, including the press, can be directed at the appropriate time 
not to contact venirepersons or jurors. There is no First 
Amendment right to contact such persons if doing so "would 
influence the jury."  See United States v. Ogle, 613  F.2d 233,  243  
(10th Cir.  1979)  (affirming obstruction of justice conviction of 
individual who distributed to sitting juror "A Handbook for Jurors" 
describing concept of jury nullification), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 825 
(1980).  
 
II.  NON-TRADITIONAL SEQUESTRATION. 
 
To the extent the above and other measures prove inadequate to 
ensure juror integrity, the Court could consider a non-traditional, 
modified form of sequestration. The hardships and isolation that 
jurors suffer during sequestration can be tempered by housing 
jurors in a facility that will enable their families to join them 
during their jury service or at least on weekends. The government 
proposes that the Court invite the parties to identify suitable 
facilities in the area of the trial.  The criteria for a suitable facility 
should include, among other factors, proximity to the courthouse; 
ability to protect jurors from outside influences; cost; sufficient 
space to accommodate families; availability of day-care,  medical  
services, religious services,  and  postal delivery; and proximity to 
leisure activities and entertainment. Although ultimately it may be 
.impossible to keep the location of the jurors secret, the parties 
should be directed to submit under seal their recommendations and 
supporting information for housing that meets those criteria once it 
is finally decided where trial is to be held.  
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The United States agrees with the Court's implicit view that 
traditional sequestration of jurors is a procedure of last resort that 
should be considered only after less restrictive alternatives have 
been exhausted. Any discussion of such alternatives is necessarily 
somewhat tentative given that trial is months away in a location 
not finally determined.  Nonetheless, there are certain general areas 
of concern, and possible steps to be taken in response, that the 
United States sought to identify in this brief.

Endnotes 
 
1. The anonymous jury cases make clear that no law requires 
public dissemination of juror names and addresses.  In re Baltimore 
Sun Co., 841 F.2d 74, 75 (4th Cir. 1988), on the other hand, held 
that [a]fter a jury has been seated, ... the names of [seated and 
unseated venirepersons] are just as much of the public record as 
any other part of the case, and we think so also are  their addresses 
in order to identify them."  The court "emphasize[d] that we do not 
deal here with a situation  in which there existed realistic threats of 
violence or jury corruption." Id. at 76 n.5.

<P>Hundreds of documents have been filed in the investigation of the bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal Building, many of which have been sealed or released to the public in revised form. Several area television stations and journalistic societies have entered this motion to unseal documents and to require hearing on the sealing of future documents.

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA 
 
 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
 
Plaintiff, 
 
v. 
 
TIMOTHY JAMES McVEIGH, 
and TERRY LYNN NICHOLS, 
 
Defendants. 
 
 
Case No. CR-95-110-A 
 
 
MEDIA GROUP'S MOTION TO OPEN SEALED 
DOCUMENTS, TO REQUIRE CAUSE BEFORE SEALING 
DOCUMENTS AND FOR ACCESS TO DOCKET SHEETS  
 
FOI Oklahoma,Inc., the Associated Press, The Daily Oklahoman, 
The Tulsa World, KFOR-TV Channel 4, KWTV Channel 9, KJRH 
Channel 2 (Tulsa), Society of Professional Journalist Oklahoma 
City Chapter and Society of Professional Journalist Eastern 
Oklahoma Chapter (hereinafter "Media Group") move this Court to 
enter an appropriate order respecting documents sealed in this and 
companion cases.  
 
In support of this motion, Media Group states that:  
 
1.   Media Group consists of a public interest association, members 
of the print and broadcast media and associations of journalists  
who have  a  legitimate interest  in observing  and reporting on the 
criminal proceedings arising from the April 19, 1995, Oklahoma 
City bombing.  Media group has standing to request access to these 
court documents under the First Amendment to the United States 
Constitution.  
 
2.   The docket sheets maintained for U.S. v. McVeigh, Case No. 
M-95-98. U.S. v. Nichols, Case No. M-95-105, and the above-
referenced case (combined), have sequential numbering gaps. 
Many filed documents are not identified with either a number or a 
brief description.  
 
3.   Media Group has not received notice of any motion to seal the 
documents and therefore has had no opportunity to object. Media 
Group is not aware of any order finding that the government 
interest in sealing the documents outweighs the public's recognized 
First Amendment right of access to said documents, or a finding 
that the Court considered less restrictive means to sealing 
documents, such as providing public access to documents in a 
redacted form.  
 
4.   As more specifically set forth in the accompanying brief, the 
First  Amendment  requires  notice  to  the public  and  an 
opportunity for the public to be heard and object to closed 
proceedings or to the sealing of documents, and the moving party 
has the burden of demonstrating a compelling interest that would 
be irreparably harmed by disclosure.  
 
5.   The documents in this case were sealed without proper 
procedures and contrary to the constitutional standards.  
 
6.   A similar motion was filed last Thursday (September 28) by 
Combined Communications Corporation of Oklahoma. See 
"Motion of Combined Communications Corporation of Oklahoma 
to Open Sealed Documents and to Direct Applicable Procedures 
for Further Orders Sealing Documents" (docket entry no. 365) and 
"Brief Supporting Motion of Combined Communications 
Corporation of Oklahoma to Open Sealed Documents and to Direct 
Applicable Procedures for Further Orders Sealing Documents" 
(docket entry no. 366).  
 
WHEREFORE, Media Group respectfully moves the Court to 
issue an order: (1) unsealing all documents previously filed under 
seal in the above-referenced and companion cases, (2) granting 
Media Group and the public the opportunity to challenge any 
further motions to seal documents or close proceedings in this 
case,and (3) directing the court clerk to provide public access to a 
complete copy of the docket sheets in the above-referenced and 
companion cases. Alternatively,Media Group moves this court to 
enter an order requiring parties to show cause why sealed 
documents should remain sealed and to release to the public 
thereafter as appropriate the sealed documents or redacted versions 
of sealed documents.

FOI Oklahoma Inc., the Associated Press, The Daily Oklahoman, 
The Tulsa World, KFOR TV Channel 4, KWTV Channel 9, KJRH 
Channel 2 (Tulsa), Society of Professional Journalist Oklahoma 
City Chapter and Society of Professional Journalist Eastern 
Oklahoma Chapter (hereinafter "Media Group") have moved this 
Court to enter an order respecting documents previously filed 
under seal in the above-referenced and related cases[fn 1] and for 
other relief.  
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The bombing of the Murrah Federal Building constituted an attack 
on the American people and our form of government. Probably no 
event since the assassination of President John F. Kennedy has had 
such an impact on the American psyche. Bringing to justice those 
responsible is the desire of all Americans. Justice in this country 
means, at an a minimum that the governmental process of 
punishing  those responsible  for  this  heinous  crime  is  above 
reproach. This means that all citizens must consistently review the 
process to insure government does not overstep the boundaries 
imposed by the Constitution of the United States of America. This 
means the process should and must be open.  
 
Already over 100 documents filed in the matter have been sealed 
and dual docket sheets (one for the public and one "not public") 
established. This has created an aura of secrecy about filed 
pleadings in a criminal trial that may be unprecedented. The 
massive closure is particularly suspect because the sealing was 
accomplished without  any record of  good cause shown  for  the 
sealing.[fn 2]  
 
At a minimum the court should hold an appropriate hearing to 
determine if the sealed documents should remain sealed and should 
release redacted versions of the documents where appropriate. The 
court should also direct the court clerk to maintain complete docket 
sheets open for public inspection that reflect all court activity.  
 
ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES 
 
The public and press have a constitutional right of access to court 
proceedings and records relating to them, and such proceedings 
and  records  are  presumptively  open. Press-Enterprise Co. v. 
Superior Court, 478 U.S. 1, 106 S.Ct. 2735, 92 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986).  
 
1.   Standing to Challenge the Sealing Order  
 
The petitioners have standing to file this motion. Indeed,the right 
of the media to contest limitations on access to judicial records and 
proceedings is recognized as being of constitutional dimension. 
Globe Newspapers Co. v. Superior Court,457 U.S. 596,699 n.25, 
102 S.Ct. 2613, 73 L.Ed.2d 248 (1982). ("[R]epresentatives of the 
press and general public must be given an opportunity to be heard 
on the question of their exclusion.")  (internal quotations and 
citations omitted.) See also In re Knoxville News-Sentinel Co., 
Inc., 723 F.2d 470, 475  (6th Cir.  1983)  ("The importance of the 
rights involved and interests served by those rights require that the 
public and press be given an opportunity to respond before being  
denied  their presumptive  right  of  access  to  judicial records.") 
Consistent with this principle, the Sixth Circuit has held that the 
media has standing to challenge even gag orders directed to the 
parties  and their counsel, since  such orders interfere with the 
media's ability to gather news,the complement to the First 
Amendment right to publish news. CBS, Inc. v. Young, 522 F.2d 
234 (6th Cir. 1975).  
 
2.   Documents were sealed contrary to the public right of access.  
 
To seal court records consistent with the First Amendment, the 
public must be given an opportunity to object and the court must 
make findings after a hearing that: (a) a compelling interest will be 
irreparably harmed if the public has access to the documents; (b) 
no alternatives to closure are reasonably available to preserve that 
interest; and (c) the closure order will be effective in 
accomplishing  its intended  purpose.  Press-Enterprise Co. v. 
Superior Court, 464 U.S. at 510.  
 
In this case, this procedure was not followed. The public was not 
given prior notice and no public documentation exists that any 
party attempted to establish the necessary predicate or that the 
court made the findings necessary to justify closure.  
 
The principal targets of the criminal investigation have been 
indicted. The investigation leading to the indictments has already 
received  pervasive  media coverage.  Potential  targets  of  the 
investigation  have already  been  put  on  notice,  or  have  been 
identified in other media coverage of the investigation. Release of 
the search warrants  and related records  is  thus  unlikely to 
interfere with any ongoing investigation. The public has a right to 
examine  the  actions  of  its  law  enforcement officers  in 
investigating these crimes. See, e.g., Gunn, 855 F.2d at 576-77 
(Heaney, J., concurring and dissenting) (noting that once there is  
extensive press coverage of an investigation, "[T]he benefit to be 
gained by continuing secrecy is negligible as compared to the 
public benefit that would be gained by disclosure.").   
 
3.   If the Proper Procedures Had Been Followed, the Finding 
Could Not Be Made for the Seal Documents Identified.  
 
Petitioners cannot identify all documents under seal because the 
"public" docket sheet is incomplete.[fn 3] Among the documents 
sealed are voucher and time records,[fn 4] defendants' bomb site 
inspection  documents, defendants' financial affidavits, probable 
cause affidavits and search warrants obtained by federal law 
enforcement agents in connection with the investigation into the 
bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. These 
documents are judicial records and, therefore, should be unsealed.  
 
The Rules for the Western District of Oklahoma state that financial 
affidavits are open.  "All statements made by a person in 
requesting counsel or during the inquiry into eligibility shall be 
either (i) by affidavit sworn to before the Court, a Court Clerk or 
Deputy, or a Notary Public, or (ii) under oath in open Court." Rule 
40 (E)(l)(a).  
 
The documents reflecting payments made under the Criminal 
Justice Act, 18 U.S.C. 3006A are also open to the public. U.S. v. 
Gerena, 703 F.Supp 211 (D.Com. 1989), judgment affirmed, U.S. 
v. Suarez, 880 F.2d 626 (2nd. Cir. 1989); see also U.S. v. Coniam, 
574 F.8 Supp. 615, 616 (D.Comm 1983).  
 
Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) requires magistrates to file with the clerk of 
the district court warrants,the returns and all supporting 
documents, These filings render those documents "judicial records" 
to which a presumption of openness attaches. In re Search Warrant 
for Second Floor Bedroom, 489 F.Supp. 207, 212, n.1 (D.R.I. 
1980).  
 
A qualified First Amendment right of access to search warrant- 
related documents has been recognized in some circuits (e.g., In re 
Search for Secretarial Area Outside Office of Gunn, 855 F.2d 569, 
573 (8th Cir. 1988) (Gunn I)); Certain Interested Individuals v. 
Pulitzer Publishing Co., 895 F.2d 460 (8th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 
Pulitzer Pub. Co. v. Certain Interested Individuals, 498 U.S. 880, 
right to a fair trial can outweigh the public's right of access to 
search warrant documents. Id. at 328-29;  see also In re Search 
Warrants, 18 Med.L.Rep. 1095, 1100 (D.D.C. 1990) ("once an 
individual  is so indicted, the public has a legitimate interest in 
information contained in the affidavits in support of the search 
warrant and oral and wire intercepts which led to the indictment. a 
) .  
 
The United States Supreme Court has held that the First 
Amendment guarantees all citizens access to judicial proceedings. 
See Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 582, 
100  S.Ct. 2814, 65 L.Ed.2d 973 (1980) (the courtroom "is a public 
place where the people generally--and representatives of the 
media--have a right to be present.").  
 
In Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court, the court reiterated the 
Richmond decision, holding that when the public and press is 
excluded from a judicial proceeding, "it must be shown that the 
denial is necessitated by a completing governmental interest, and is 
narrowly tailored to serve that interest." Globe, supra p. 607. 
Richmond and Globe acknowledge the fundamental principle that: 
"What transpires in the courtroom is public property." Richmond, 
supra p. 583, n.9 [quoting Craig v. Harney, 331 U.S. 367, 374 
(1947), 67 S.Ct. 1249, 91 L.Ed 1546 (1947)]. An essential 
principle of our Constitution is:  
 
" . . . the common understanding [is] that "a major purpose of [the 
First]  Amendment was to protect the free discussion of public 
affairs." by  offering  such protection, the First Amendment serves 
to ensure that the individual citizen can effectively participate in 
and contribute to our republican system of self-government." 
(citations omitted)  
 
Globe, supra p. 604.  The First Amendment right of access to 
judicial  proceedings  "ensure[s] that [the] constitutionally 
protected 'discussion of governmental affairs' is an informed one." 
Globe, supra p. 605.  The guarantee of access "permits the public 
to participate in and serve as a check upon the judicial process-- an 
essential component in our structure of self-government." Globe, 
supra,p. 606. Further, when court proceedings have been concealed 
from public view an unexpected outcome can cause a reaction that 
the system at best has failed and at worst has been corrupted. 
Richmond, supra p. 571.  
 
This First Amendment right of access extends beyond the trial 
phase to other judicial proceedings. Press-Enterprise v. Riverside 
County  Superior Court,  478  U.S.  at  106 (access  extends  to 
preliminary proceedings in criminal cases).[fn 6] The First 
Amendment right of access extends to court records.  
 
"Throughout our history, the open courtroom has been a 
fundamental feature of the American judicial system. Basic 
principles have emerged to guide judicial discretion respecting 
public access to judicial proceedings. These principles apply as 
well to the determination of whether to permit access to 
information contained in court documents because court records 
often provide important, sometimes the only, bases or explanations 
for a court's decision."  
 
Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co. v. F.T.C., 710 F.2d at 1177. 
Thus, the United States Constitution imposes a heavy presumption 
that the judicial proceedings and records are open to the public and 
to the media as representatives of the media.  
 
There is a long-standing presumption in the common law that the 
public has  access to judicial records.   Nixon v. Warner 
Communications, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 597 (1978); United States v. 
Rosenthal, 763 F.2d 1291, 1293 (11th Cir. 1985). This 
presumption of access can be rebutted only if countervailing 
interests "heavily outweigh the public interests in access."  
Rushford v. New Yorker Magazine, Inc.,  846 F.2d 249,  253  (4th 
Cir.  1988).   The party seeking to overcome the presumption of 
access bears the burden of showing some "significant interest" that 
outweighs the presumption.    
 
Further, following the U.5. Supreme Courts guidance on access to 
court proceedings, the courts have recognized that access to 
judicial records are also within the ambit of the First Amendment. 
In Brown, the Sixth Circuit vacated a suppression order that the 
district court had entered with regard to all documents filed by one 
of the parties, based on First Amendment and common law rights 
of access to judicial records. In so holding, the court found that 
"the First Amendment and the common law do limit judicial 
discretion" to seal court documents. Brown, supra, p. 1177. The 
Court went on to hold that the same constitutional and common 
law legal principles applicable to open courtrooms apply to a 
judicial file.  Id.  
 
Similarly, in Associated Press v. U.S. District Court for Cent. Dist. 
of Col., 705 F.2d 1143,  1145  (9th Cir.  1983),  the district court 
had prohibited public access to any of the pretrial documents filed 
in the federal prosecution of John De Lorean.  The Ninth Circuit 
reversed, and held that the public's right of access to these 
documents was based upon the First Amendment as well as the 
common law.  Accord Application of National Broadcasting Co., 
Inc., 828 F.2d 340 (6th Cir. 1987);  In Re San Juan Star Co., 662 
F.2d 108 (1st Cir. 1981); In the Matter of Continental Illinois 
Securities Litigation, 732 F.2d 1302 (7th Cir. 1984); United States 
v. Dorfman, 690 F.2d 1230 (7th Cir. 1982).  
 
In  short,  the  right  of  access  to  judicial records  is guaranteed 
both under the common law and by the United Stated Constitution 
and this presumptive right has not been overcome by appropriate 
findings that would justify closure.  
 
4.  Docket Sheet Should Reflect All Filings  
 
Even if all the documents now under seal were properly sealed 
based on a careful analysis, Media Group knows of no valid reason 
for maintaining dual docket sheets: one for the public and one for 
the parties. Docket sheets merely memorialize a very brief and 
encapsulated form of pleadings filed with the court. As argued 
hereinbefore, these filings (particularly in a criminal case) are 
presumptively open.  
 
Media Group cannot  conceive  of  a  situation where truly 
confidential matters could not be  filed under  seal with  the 
appropriate docket number and a brief description, (i.e., a caption 
from the pleading file), that would not fully protect whatever 
confidentiality has been found necessary. The docket entry could 
merely indicate that that document was filed under seal. In fact, the 
missing docket numbers are easily inferred from the sequential 
gaps. Thus, no purpose is presently being served by not having the 
docket entries entered sequentially. Again, a brief description or 
caption from the pleading can hardly be considered a breach of 
confidentiality.  It is very important for the public to have 
confidence in its court system and that confidence, at a minimum 
requires that every document filed is given a number and briefly 
described. It would even be more appropriate if some reference 
was made to the order authorizing the sealing. As the Eighth 
Circuit[fn 7] and the Eleventh Circuit has held,[fn 8] this dual 
docketing sheet system is contrary to the Constitution.  
 
5.   Current Nationwide Concern Has Heightened the Public's Need 
for Access.  
 
The Washington Post decision, which emphasizes one particular 
importance of public access to judicial documents related to the 
criminal justice system strikes an apropos chord in light of the  
anger and confusion still felt nationwide in the aftermath of the 
Oklahoma City bombing:   
 
"Violent crime has a profound impact upon societal well-being and 
often provokes public reactions of fear and outrage, as well as 
compassion for its victims. 'When the public is aware that the law 
is being enforced and the criminal justice system  is  functioning,  
an  outlet  is provided  for  these understandable reactions and 
emotions.'"  
 
Id. at 330 (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 464 
U.S. at 509). The court further noted that releasing search warrant 
documents addresses the public's legitimate concerns about police 
methods and techniques as well as the public's right to be aware of  
crime patterns. Id. at 331. These concerns are magnified now, due 
to domestic terrorist atrocities such as the bombing of the World 
Trade Center and the Oklahoma City federal building. In addition, 
fears of continuing threats have been intensified by recent moves to 
increase security at the White House,other federal buildings and 
airports across the country.  In view of the current national 
sentiment, releasing the requested search warrant documents is not  
only justified, but mandated under the "public need" test set out by 
the Ninth Circuit in Times Mirror.   
 
At a Minimum, the Court Should Require Cause to be Shown 
and/or Release the Search Warrant Documents in Redacted Form.  
 
A court may deny public access to judicial proceedings and 
documents only "when sealing is 'essential to preserve higher 
values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.'" Baltimore 
Sun Co. v. Goetz, 886 F.2d 60, 65-66 (4th Cir. 1989) (quoting 
Press- Enterprise I, 464 U.S. at 510). Courts must consider 
alternatives to sealing documents, which "ordinarily involves 
disclosing some of the documents or giving access to a redacted 
version." Id. at 66. Thus, to the extent this court deems it necessary 
to keep certain portions of the search warrant documents under 
seal, it should release the documents with those portions redacted. 
See, e.g., In Re Search Warrants, 18 Med.L.Rep. 1095, 1100 
(D.D.C. 1990) (permitting the release of search warrant affidavits  
in redacted form to protect the privacy rights of innocent third 
parties).  
 
RELIEF REQUESTED 
 
For the foregoing reasons, the court should grant petitioners' 
motion and order that: (1) the public shall have immediate access 
to all sealed documents,(2) the court clerk is to provide immediate 
public access to the complete docket sheets in these cases, and (3) 
hereafter petitioners are to receive notice of motions to seal 
documents and be given an opportunity to object before those 
motions are considered. Alternatively, the Court should order the 
parties to show cause why sealed documents should remain sealed 
and, absent the necessary showing,unseal the documents or provide 
public access to  redacted versions of the documents where 
appropriate.

Before ANDERSON, BALDOCK, and BRORBY, Circuit Judges.  
 
PER CURIAM.  
 
On April 19, 1995, a bomb exploded at the Alfred P. Murrah 
Federal Building in Oklahoma City.  The explosion destroyed the 
Murrah Building, killed 169 people, injured many others, and 
caused extensive damage in the surrounding vicinity.  The 
explosion inflicted massive damage (upwards of $1,000,000) to the 
United States Federal Courthouse, which is located one block 
south of the Murrah building.  Over one hundred windows 
shattered and were blown out.  The explosion caused substantial 
damage to interior ceilings, walls, and fixtures.  The explosion 
decimated the glass doors at the entrance to the courthouse.  
District court chambers located on the third and fourth floors along 
the north side of the courthouse, including Judge Alley's third floor 
chambers and courtroom, were heavily damaged.  Flying glass 
damaged woodwork and furniture in Judge Alley's courtroom.  
Parts of the ceiling collapsed in Judge Alley's chambers.  Plaster 
ceiling tiles fell from the office ceilings and light fixtures were 
dislodged and left hanging.  The skylight in Judge Alley's 
courtroom shattered, covering the courtroom floor in an inch of 
broken glass.  
 
Although Judge Alley lost no family or friends in the bombing, the 
explosion slightly injured a member of his staff, and injured other 
court personnel.  Some court personnel and employees had friends 
or relatives who were injured or killed in the Murrah building 
explosion.  It is likely that other court personnel and two judges 
would have been severely injured had they been at their desks.  
 
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were charged by grand jury 
indictment with the bombing.  The indictment charges defendants 
with a total of eleven counts of violating the laws of the United 
States:  one count of Conspiracy to Use a Weapon of Mass 
Destruction in violation of 18 U.S.C.  2332a; one count of the Use 
of a Weapon of Mass Destruction in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 
2332a and 2(a) & (b); one count of Destruction by Explosive in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. Sections 844(f) and 2(a) & (b); and eight 
counts of First Degree Murder in violation of 18 U.S. C. Sections 
1114, 1111 and 2(a) & (b).  
 
Mr. McVeigh filed a motion for recusal of the presiding judge, the 
Honorable Wayne E. Alley, who had been randomly assigned to 
the case.  Thereafter, Mr. Nichols filed his own recusal motion, 
arguing additional bases for recusal not presented by Mr. 
McVeigh.  By order dated September 14, 1995, Judge Alley denied 
both recusal motions.  Mr. Nichols then filed a petition for writ of 
mandamus with this court, seeking disqualification of all judges of 
the Western District of Oklahoma (including Judge Alley) or, in 
the alternative, an order directing Judge Alley to permit discovery 
and hold an evidentiary hearing regarding the factual bases for 
disqualification issues raised in the recusal motion.  Thus, this 
matter is before us as an original proceeding in the nature of 
mandamus.    
 
An order denying a motion to recuse is interlocutory and is, 
therefore, not immediately appealable.  Lopez v. Behles (In re 
American Ready Mix, Inc.), 14 F.3d 1497, 1499 (10th Cir.), cert. 
denied, 115 S. Ct. 77 (1994).  It is established in this circuit, 
however, that mandamus is an appropriate vehicle by which to 
challenge a district court's denial of a recusal motion.  Id.; United 
States v. Cooley, 1 F.3d 985, 996 n.9 (10th Cir. 1993) (collecting 
and comparing cases).  Although a district court's denial of a 
motion to recuse is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, Maez V. 
Mountain States Tel. & Tel., Inc., 54 F.3d 1488, 1508 (10th Cir. 
1995), because we are reviewing the district court's order by means 
of mandamus, the higher standard dictated by that writ governs our 
review, In re American Ready Mix, 14 F.3d at 1501.  Mandamus is 
available only upon a showing of a clear and indisputable right to 
relief.  Weston v. Mann (In re Weston), 18 F.3d 860, 864 (10th Cir. 
1994).  A petitioner seeking mandamus relief must demonstrate a 
clear abuse of discretion, or conduct by the district court 
amounting to a usurpation of judicial authority.  Mallard v. United 
States District Court, 490 U.S. 296, 309 (1989).  "To ensure that 
mandamus remains an extraordinary remedy, petitioners must 
show that they lack adequate alternative means to obtain the relief 
they seek. . . ." Id.  
 
Mr. Nichols argues that Judge Alley's recusal is mandated by 28 
U.S.C. Section 455(a), which states that a judge "shall disqualify 
himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might 
reasonably be questioned."1  In order to "promote public 
confidence in the integrity of the judicial process," the statute was 
broadened in 1974 by replacing the subjective standard with an 
objective test.  Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., 486 
U.S. 847, 858 n.7 (1988).  "[W]hat matters is not the reality of bias 
or prejudice but its appearance."  Liteky v. United States, 114 S. 
Ct. 1147, 1154 (1994).  Given the statutory parameters, we must 
determine "'whether a reasonable person, knowing all the relevant 
facts, would harbor doubts about the judge's impartiality.'"  
Cooley, 1 F.3d at 993 (quoting United States v. Burger, 964 F.2d 
1065, 1070 (10th Cir. 1992)(further quotation omitted)); see also 
Maez, 54 F.3d at 1508; United States v. Greenspan 26 F.3d 1001, 
1005 (10th Circ. 1994); Hinman v. Rogers, 831 F.2d 937, 939 
(10th Cir. 1987).  
 
The goal of section 455(a) is to avoid even the appearance of 
partiality.  If it would appear to a reasonable person that a judge 
has knowledge of facts that would give him an interest in the 
litigation then an appearance of partiality is created even though no 
actual partiality exists because the judge does not recall the facts, 
because the judge actually has no interest in the case or because the 
judge is pure in heart and incorruptible.  
 
Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 860 (quotation omitted).  In applying this 
objective standard, the initial inquiry is whether a reasonable 
factual basis exists for questioning the judge's impartiality.  
Cooley, 1 F.3d at 993.  We are limited in this regard to outward 
manifestations and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom.  Id. "In 
applying   455(a), the judge's actual state of mind, purity of heart, 
incorruptibility, or lack of partiality are not the issue."  Id.  
 
Having stated what Section 455(a) is intended to accomplish and 
the standards for analyzing a recusal motion under that statute, we 
now note the cautions that must accompany our analysis.  The 
statute "'must not be so broadly construed that it becomes, in 
effect, presumptive, so that recusal in mandated upon the merest 
unsubstantiated suggestion of personal bias or prejudice.'"  Id. 
(quoting Franks V. Nimmo, 796 F.2d 1230, 1235 (10th Cir. 
1986)(further quotation omitted)).  Neither is the statute intended 
to bestow veto power over judges or to be used as a judge shopping 
device.  Greenspan, 26 F.3d at 1006; Cooley, 1 F.3d at 993.  
Further, we are mindful that a judge has as strong a duty to sit 
when there is no legitimate reason to recuse as he does to recuse 
when the law and facts require.  Greenspan, 26 F.3d at 1005; In re 
American ready Mix, Inc., 14 F.3d at 1501; Hinman, 831 F.2d at 
939.  
 
We begin our application of the legal standards to these facts by 
recognizing that cases within Section  455(a) are extremely fact 
driven "and must be judged on [their] unique facts and 
circumstances more than by comparison to situations considered in 
prior jurisprudence."  United States v. Jordan, 49 F.3d 152, 157 
(5th Cir. 1995).  As a starting point, in Cooley this court supplied a 
nonexhaustive list of various matters not ordinarily sufficient to 
require Section 455(a) recusal:  
 
(1) Rumor, speculation, beliefs, conclusions, innuendo,  suspicion, 
opinion, and similar non-factual matters; (2) the mere fact that a 
judge has previously expressed an opinion on a point of law or has 
expressed a dedication to upholding the law or a determination to 
impose severe punishment within the limits of the law upon those 
found guilty of a particular offense; (3) prior rulings in the 
proceeding, or another proceeding, solely because they  were 
adverse; (4) mere familiarity with the  defendant(s), or the type of 
charge, or kind of defense presented; (5) baseless personal attacks 
on or suits against the judge by a party; (6) reporters' personal 
opinions or characterizations appearing in the media, media 
notoriety, and reports in the media purporting to be factual, such as 
quotes attributed to the judge or others, but which are in fact false 
or materially inaccurate or misleading; and (7) threats or other 
attempts to intimidate the judge.  
 
1 F. 3d at 993-94 (citations omitted).  We are faced with none of 
those circumstances here. Neither do we have a case in which a 
judge is threatened and the judge determines that recusal is at least 
one of the movant's objective.  Greenspan, 26 F.3d at 1006.  
Further, all of the reasons Mr. Nichols asserts for recusal under 
Section 455(a) arise from extra-judicial sources, a consideration 
the Supreme Court recently should be a factor in our analysis.  The 
Court held, however, that acquisition of alleged bias or prejudice 
from extra-judicial sources is neither a necessary nor sufficient 
condition for Section 455(a) recusal.  Liteky, 114 S. Ct. at 1157.  
 
Needless to say, there is no case with similar facts to which we can 
look for guidance in our application of the law to the facts in this 
case.  Both the government and Judge Alley, in his invited 
response to the mandamus petition, point to several cases in which 
courts have held that the situation was not such that a judge's 
impartiality might reasonably be questioned.  Those cases are all 
legally sound, strong authority for the general principles for which 
they are cited.  Unfortunately, however, they do not particularly aid 
our analysis because, as we stated previously, our determination in 
this case is extremely fact driven, and all those cases, in addition to 
those uncovered by our own research, are factually inapposite.  If 
the question of whether Section 455(a) requires disqualification is 
a close one, the balance tips in favor of recusal.  United States v. 
Dandy, 998 F.2d 1344, 1349 (6th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S. 
Ct. 1188 (1994).  
 
In light of the settled principle that a judge has as strong an 
obligation not to recuse when the situation does not require as he 
has to recuse when it is necessary, we commend Judge Alley for 
his integrity in upholding what he sees as his clear judicial duty.  
There is certainly no allegation here of judicial impropriety; Judge 
Alley has conducted himself and these proceeding with true 
professionalism.  Were the standard by which we must judge this 
case a subjective one, we could end our discussion here.  But our 
task is to address the objective requirements of Section 455(a).  
 
The government maintains that no reasonable person could have a 
basis for questioning the judge's impartiality.  We disagree.  We 
conclude based on the extraordinary circumstances of this case that 
a "reasonable person, knowing all the relevant facts, would harbor 
doubts about the judge's impartiality."  Cooley, 1 F.3d at 993.  
Judge Alley's courtroom and chambers were one block away from 
the epicenter of a massive explosion that literally rocked 
downtown Oklahoma City, heavily damaged the Murrah building, 
killed 169 people, and injured many others.  The blast crushed the 
courthouse's glass doors, shattered numerous windows, ripped 
plaster from ceiling, dislodged light fixtures, showered floors with 
glass, damaged Judge Alley's courtroom and chambers, and injured 
a member of his staff, as well as other court personnel and their 
families.  Based on these circumstances, we conclude that a 
reasonable person could not help but harbor doubts about the 
impartiality of Judge Alley,  Because Judge Alley's "impartiality 
might reasonably be questioned" in the instant case, 28 U.S.C. 
Section 455(a) mandates recusal.    
 
Based on the extraordinary facts of this case, we further conclude 
that Mr. Nichols has satisfied the demanding standard for 
mandamus relief and has established a clear and indisputable right 
to relief.  See Mallard, 490 U.S. at 309; In re Weston, 18 F.3d at 
864.  Further, Mr. Nichols has no adequate alternative means to 
obtain the relief he seeks.  See Mallard, 490 U.S. at 309.  
Consequently, we hold that Mr. Nichols has discharged his burden 
of proving he is entitled to a writ of mandamus.  
 
As the Fifth Circuit concluded in Jordan, "[p]ublic respect for the 
judiciary demands this result."  49 F.3d at 157.  The effect of our 
decision today may, indeed, be to "bar trial by [a] judge[] who 
ha[s] no actual bias and who would do [his] very best to weigh the 
scales of justice equally between contending parties.  But to 
perform its high function in the best way justice must satisfy the 
appearance of justice."  Id. (quotation omitted).  In reaching this 
result, we have considered the totality of the circumstances and 
looked to the future of this case.  United States v. Ritter, 540 F.2d 
459, 464 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 951 (1976).  We have 
also balanced the possible questioning of impartiality by a 
reasonable person against the relative ease of replacing Judge 
Alley with an available judge from a very large pool of judges 
outside the State of Oklahoma.  
 
Finally, we have considered and reject as meritless all other 
arguments raised.  The petition for writ of mandamus solely as it 
pertains to the named respondent is GRANTED, and the matter is 
referred to the Chief Judge for the Tenth Circuit for reassignment.  
See Texaco v. Chandler, 354 F.2d 655, 657 (10th Cir. 1965), cert. 
denied, 383 U.S. 936 (1966).2  
 
SO ORDERED.  
 
 
Footnotes:  
 
*After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel  
has determined unanimously that oral argument would not 
materially 
assist the determination of this appeal.  See Fed. R. App. P. 
34(a); 10th Cir. R. 34.1.9.  The motion for oral argument is 
therefore denied and the case ordered submitted on the briefs.  
 
1 Mr. Nichols also urges recusal based on actual bias and 
prejudice under 28 U.S.C. Sections 144 & 455(b)(1).  In light of 
our 
disposition under Section 455(a), we do not reach these remaining 
statutory arguments.    
 
2 Petitioner's request to file a reply brief is denied.  The  
Petitoner's motion to supplement the record is denied.

(THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN OPEN COURT

ON APRIL 19, 1995 WITH ALL PARTIES PRESENT:)

                 THE COURT:  The Court would like to advise

you that there is a little bird family that is in this area.

We have had the best minds in the institution to check it out,

but they are chirping.  And they have advised us to leave them

alone, and that's what we are going to do.  You will hear a

little noise so don't worry about it.

     I would like to introduce you to my staff that is here:

My clerk is Bill French seated to my left; law clerks Dale

Kelly and Lynn Burch seated to my right.

    Also present to my left over there behind that bench is

pre-trial services officer Marcy Gray.  Court reporters Lynn

Hilton and Charyse Crawford are to my right.

    I would like Counsel who are present to introduce

themselves, beginning with the Counsel for the United States.

         MR. GARLAND:  Your Honor, my name is Merrick Garland.

I am an Associate Deputy Attorney General.

         MS. JOPLIN:  Arlene Joplin, Western District of

Oklahoma, AUSA.

         THE COURT:  And Counsel for the defendant?

         MR. COYLE:  Judge, I am John W. Coyle, and I represent

the accused, and I would ask the Court if the handcuffs could

be removed during this hearing.

         THE COURT:  I am sorry?

         MR. COYLE:  If his handcuffs could be removed during

the hearing.

         THE COURT:  I have told the marshal's office that is a

matter within their discretion at this time.

         MR. COYLE:  Would the Court inquire of the marshals if

they could remove them?  There are about forty guards, seems

like, in the room, if we could have them removed for the

hearing.

         THE COURT:  If the marshals indicated that  he should

be cuffed, he should stay cuffed.  That will be it.

    Anything else?

         MS. OTTO:  Susan Otto, Federal Public Defender.  I am

also here to represent Mr. McVeigh.  Also with me at counsel

table, Mr. Kevin McNally.  Mr. McNally is here in his capacity

as attorney for the Death Penalty Resource Counsel Center which

is under the auspices of the United States Courts.

         THE COURT:  Anyone else?  I believe also present,

entering an appearance early this morning, Paul Looney and J.

Brent Liedtke from Houston, possibly privately-retained counsel

for the Defendant.

         I appreciate very much the arrangements that have been

made for this room to serve as a courtroom.  The Court has

found that under circumstances, unusual circumstances, that

existed in the federal courtroom in downtown Oklahoma City, the

federal courthouse, the reconstruction and other clean-up

operations that are going on there, as well as the security and

safety of all persons concerned, that we should conduct this

hearing in this room.

    In that regard I wanted to especially thank Warden R. G.

Thompson and his staff, as well as United States Marshal Pat

Wilkerson.

    At this time I am going to ask that counsel confer after

the Court makes a statement and a record regarding what has

transpired basically since he initially appeared last Friday,

and especially with regard to defense counsel.

    As the defendant knows, at the time of the initial

appearance last Friday at Tinker Air Force Base, that Mr. Coyle

and Ms. Otto were appointed as counsel to represent the

Defendant, both highly qualified and skilled attorneys.

    I was not aware that there was any problem in connection

with their representation until Monday, when motions were filed

indicating that counsel desired to withdraw.

    After carefully considering those motions, the Court

entered an order which temporarily, at least, overruled those

motions counsel then would -- Ms. Otto and Mr. Coyle would

continue to represent the Defendant, and they are serving in

that capacity here today.

     They are very fine professional lawyers and I perceive no

problem with their representation of the Defendant in

connection with these proceedings, although they -- one or more
                                                       
of them may be granted permission to withdraw.

    The Court's appointment of counsel is made under statutory

provisions that provides that two counsel, two attorneys, shall

be appointed for any person that may be charged with a death

penalty offense, and those attorneys are required to have

certain skills and certain experience.  And I wanted the record

to show that since that hearing, and since I learned that a

motion had been filed by the initial attorneys the Court had

appointed, that the Federal Public Defender's Office, under the

statute, has been conducting a nationwide search, in effect, to

determine what counsel might be available to replace Mr. Coyle

and Ms. Otto, if that is actually necessary.

    Circumstances may have changed and this situation is

developing as we continue the hearing today.  So we had that

survey conducted and we had some recommendations of very fine

attorneys that might replace those initial attorneys if that is

necessary.

     And I am telling, making this statement because it's

necessary for the Court to exercise oversight in connection

with the Counsel who represent a person who is indigent.

    The Court understands the Defendant is indigent.  I made

that initial appointment on that basis, and in contrast to

that, privately-retained Counsel may appear, assuming that

either the Defendant, or if the Defendant is indigent, friends

or relatives of the Defendant, may be able to employ counsel,
                                                       
and that situation has occurred just in the last, really in the

last few hours.

    I wasn't aware until yesterday afternoon sometime that

Mr. Looney or Mr. Liedtke might be interested in entering an

appearance and represent the Defendant in this case.  And all

this other has been going on at the same time.

    We have been doing a survey to determine what substitute

Counsel might be appointed by the Court, and later then learned

that Mr. Looney and Mr. Liedtke might represent the Defendant

also.

    I think the attorneys have conferred some about this.  I

would like, if it's necessary, to have a further conference

before we proceed with this hearing, between the attorneys,

both privately-retained counsel and court-appointed counsel, to

determine who should appropriately represent the Defendant in

connection with this proceeding.

    Obviously, this requires some conferencing with the

Defendant and answering of any of his questions that he might

have.  I wanted the record to show what has happened since the

Counsel was appointed because I didn't have much opportunity to

explain that on Friday evening when we had the hearing at

Tinker.  Does anyone want to address that issue at this time?

         MR. LOONEY:  Yes.

         THE COURT:  Yes, sir, Mr. Looney.

         MR. LOONEY:  Your Honor, if I may be heard on that

                                                       

issue.  I believe it's in the best interest of the Defendant to

go forward with the team at the table.

         THE COURT:  All right, sir.

         MR. LOONEY:  At this time.  The conferences have been

had and that is the desire of the Defendant, and in my opinion

in the best interest of the Defendant.

         THE COURT:  Anyone else want to speak to that issue?

If not, then we will not take the recess and we will proceed

with the hearing.

    Is there any statements that need to be made before we

proceed with the evidence in this case?

        MR. GARLAND:  Your Honor, if the Defendant could state

on the record that he is satisfied with going forward with

Counsel for this hearing.

         THE COURT:  I will ask if the defendant has any

questions about the matters of the counsel, any additional

questions that need to be asked, and certainly I will try to

ask those.

         MR. COYLE:  He will stand moot, Judge.

         THE COURT:  If there are no further questions, I will

proceed on preliminary hearing and combined detention hearing

in case No. CR-95-98, United States of America versus Timothy

James McVeigh.

         MS. OTTO:  Your Honor, if I may?

         THE COURT:  Yes, Ms. Otto.

                                                       

         MS. OTTO:  I received the Court's order denying our

request for transfer of this case yesterday.

         THE COURT:  I am sorry, the what?

         MS. OTTO:  I am sorry.  Perhaps if I can step to the

center it would be easier and I could get over the bird noise.

         THE COURT:  The birds are chirping away.

         MS. OTTO:  I might have to chirp a little more loudly

than they do.

         Your Honor, I received a copy of the Court's order

yesterday denying our request for appointment of substitute

counsel, and in the same order our motion to transfer this case

was denied, and based on --

        THE COURT:  Would you hand me the Court's order?

        MS. OTTO:  Based on the Court's order and findings the

Court made at that time.

         THE COURT:  Do you have a copy of it?

         MR. COYLE:  I have got it.

         MS. OTTO:  There we go, thank you.

         THE COURT:  I believe that is it.

         MS. OTTO:  I believe that it is appropriate as a

preliminary matter to reurge our motion to transfer at this

time.  The substance of our motion to transfer went hand and

glove with our request to have alternate counsel appointed to

represent Mr. McVeigh.  And our conflicts that arise,

Mr. Coyle's and mine, in this case are inextricably involved

                                                       

with our motion to transfer.

    This is a very unusual case and the government has relied

essentially in its response on the Harrelson and Shagra cases

which, of course, arose out of the assassination of Judge Woods

down in Texas.  And that is a primary authority on which the

government relies in support of its argument that transfer is

not warranted at this time.

    The government's response, and I believe also the Court's

order, does not address certain aspects of our motion, and

that's why I wanted to touch on this point again at this time.

    Your Honor, the essence of our motion to transfer, the

essence of our motions to have alternate counsel appointed, is

simply that this case has been so extraordinary, and has such

extreme magnitude that it impossible for any of us who were in

downtown Oklahoma City on the morning of April 19th to proceed

in this case.

    Judge Woods, for example, was shot at his home while he was

on his way to work.  There have been other attacks, the World

Trade Center bombing, for example, and certain other events

that occurred that certainly are equally traumatic events.

    But I have found no case in the history of this country

that is of such magnitude as the one we are involved in right

now.

    And certainly as lawyers one of the things Mr. Coyle and I

have considered during our representation of Mr. McVeigh is not

                                                       

the actual provision of counsel in an appropriate and effective

and zealous manner that is required by the Constitution,

required by the cases effectuating the Constitution, but also

the appearance of impropriety that might arise.

    It is really that appearance of impropriety that prompted

us to file our request for appointment of the substitute

counsel and our request to transfer at this juncture.

    Now, certainly the judge who presided in Judge Woods' case,

the case involving the assassination of Judge Woods was an

honorary Pall bearer and was a jurist who was well acquainted

with Judge Woods.  The Fifth Circuit found no flaw in that, but

that is a far cry from a judge who is acquainted with a victim

to a judge who actually witnessed the events as they occurred.

    This record may be reviewed at some later time by people far

removed from the events, both physically and temporally, and I

think it is absolutely essential for the effective

representation of Mr. McVeigh to have a clear record of exactly

what it is we are talking about.

    Now, the events of April 19th were obviously cataclysmic

beyond definition.  The A.P. Murrah Building, which is located

directly across from the federal courthouse in Oklahoma City,

was virtually destroyed, demolished, right on the spot, by a

very powerful explosion.

    The results of that explosion caused windows, doors, and

other items within the federal courthouse building to be blown

                                                       

to pieces.

    The judges' chambers on the north side of the federal

courthouse building were shattered where the windows blew in,

doors blew in, and people in the building were injured during

that explosion.

    On the first floor, jurors who were deliberating were

physically injured.  And one of the judges, the judge who was

presiding over that trial, was out on the street assisting her

jurors into ambulances.

    Judge Argo, who is on the first floor at the northeast

corner of the federal courthouse, was probably spared from

certain death by the fact his windows on the ground floor are

bulletproof glass.  They appear to be sand-blasted.

    In my building, my office windows on the north floor were

completely destroyed.  Fortunately, I wasn't sitting at my desk

at the time.  Fortunately for all of my staff, none of us were

injured.

    We evacuated the building as everyone else did.  One of my

lawyers was missing.  She was in court.  And I spent probably

five to ten minutes running up and down the street in front of

the federal courthouse trying to find my lawyer who was lost.

Once I located her, one of my other lawyers informed me that

his child was supposed to be at the YMCA Day Care Center, and

he couldn't find his child.  We spent the next 45 minutes

trying to locate his child.

                                                       

    I am aware that you, Judge Howland, were also present

during the events and that you witnessed what went on.

    I think the record should also reflect that I am personally

acquainted on a professional basis with the following people:

Cynthia Lynn Campbell Brown, a special agent with the Secret

Service.  She was over in our offices discussing a case with

our investigator shortly before she left to get married.

    Aaron Coverdale and Elijah Coverdale, ages 5 and 2 are the

children of one of our former clients.

    Steve Curry, who worked for General Services Administration

as an inspector, assisted us in the renovation of our offices.

    Christi Jenkins, is an employee at the Federal Employees

Credit Union where I had two accounts, and I have done business

with her on many, many occasions.

    Donald Ray Leonard, special agent with the Secret Service,

I am personally acquainted with him in a professional capacity.

    Michael Loundenslager, a planner/estimator for General

Services Administration, also assisted us with our renovation

in our building.

    Mickey Bryant Maroney is a Secret Service agent with whom I

have handled maybe twenty cases in the past few years.

    Kenneth Glenn McCullough, special agent with the Drug

Enforcement Administration, with a very important case pending

with us in our office.

    Paul Ice, who is listed -- all of those people are dead.

                                                       

Paul Ice, a senior special agent with the Customs Service.  I

am also well-acquainted with him as a result of his

professional capacity and mine.  He is listed as missing, and

this morning's casualty list, it's my understanding that they

have recovered his body, and he is dead.

    Tresia Worton, another Federal Employees' Credit Union

worker is still missing.  I am unaware of her status.

    I am personally acquainted with every one of these people.

I have been down to the federal courthouse, starting now on my

11th year.  I know these people.  I have done business with

these people, and although certainly we don't work in the same

agency, we have had a cordial, working relationship that places

me in the position of knowing on a first-name, by-sight basis,

victims of these events.

    I do not believe this is a case that falls within the

ambiance of Harrelson and Shagra.  This is a case of

extraordinary proportions.  Mr. Coyle was personally acquainted

with an attorney who has also been killed as a result of this

bombing incident.

    I was certainly present during most of the events in the

early morning of April 19th, and at one point in the afternoon

I could no longer find my investigator because a man with whom

he had been associated with for a number of years, who is on

special assignment with the Drug Enforcement Administration,

was unaccounted for, and my investigator was down at the

                                                       

building looking for him.

    When I couldn't find my investigator after two hours, I

went back down to the scene and went looking for him.

Fortunately I found my investigator, and his friend was also

unharmed during these events.

    This is not an instance where publicity has been limited.

I respectfully disagree with the Court's characterization that

the principal portion of the publicity has been about the

factual circumstances surrounding the bombing and the attempted

recovery of victims and potential survivors.

    I don't have all the papers nationwide.  Certainly I have

been contacted by virtually every print media and video media

person or seems like I have been, requesting information about

this case.  But I do have the last seven editions, I don't have

the Sunday edition of The Daily Oklahoman, and I would like to

place these of record as well.

         THE COURT:  Do you want to use those at this time?

         MS. OTTO:   I do, Your Honor.

         THE COURT:  Do you have them numbered?

         MS. OTTO:  Yes, I do.  Exhibit No. 1 -- Defendant's

Exhibit No. 1, is Thursday, April 20, 1995, the banner headline

is "Morning of Terror, City Struggles With Shock of Deadly

Bombing."

    The very next day, Friday, April 21st, this would be

Defendant's Exhibit No. 2.  "FBI Seeks Two in Terrorist Blast,"

                                                       

and this is the first day we have a composite photograph of the

men who are identified by the FBI as suspects.

    The third came Saturday, April 22nd, is Defendant's Exhibit

No. 3, "Bomb Suspect Charged," and a large picture of Mr.

McVeigh and the escort of -- well, I can recognize one FBI

agent right off the bat, and appears to be several others and

several sheriff's deputies, Defendant's Exhibit No. 3.

    Defendant's Exhibit No. 4 is the Monday April 24th,

newspaper, "A Time to Grieve."  It's the banner headline.  This

is photograph of the memorial services with President Clinton

and Governor Keating.  But below the fold, we have "Search

Continues For Second Suspect.  Man Questioned In The

Investigation Of This Case Figures Prominently" on the first

page of the paper.

    Defendant's Exhibit No. 5, "FBI Combs Through Leads In

Bombing Case" and the coverage generally continues with the FBI

ongoing investigation of this case and contains some

information about additional suspects who have been

identified.

    On Wednesday, April 26th, Defendant's Exhibit No. 6, we

have the lead which is "Chemical Test Point to McVeigh." And I

guess it would be the lead story: "FBI theorizes John Doe 2 May

Be Dead."  We have specific information about Mr. McVeigh,

specific information about this case, specific information

about incriminating evidence that the FBI is alleging links

                                                       

Mr. McVeigh to these incidents.

         THE COURT:  Is that 6?

         MS. OTTO:  Yes, this is Exhibit No. 6, correct.

Defendant's Exhibit No. 7 is today's newspaper and it contains

banner headline:  "Friend puts McVeigh in City on Easter.  Bomb

Suspect Talked About Something Big."

    This is an article that primarily reports the events in

Terry Nichols' court hearing had in Wichita yesterday.  Again,

it is all information directly concerning Mr. McVeigh.

    We do not have, and as I am sure the Court has reviewed the

cases that have been cited, publicity cases do generally turn

on the degree of saturation of the media, the length of time

that has elapsed since the events, and the court proceedings,

and the nature of the communications that have been conveyed in

the courts.

    Now, certainly I will agree with the Court's

characterization that a great deal of the media focus was

initially on rescue efforts, the suffering of the victims and

the victims' families, and the heroic efforts of all parties in

attempting to find survivors as quickly as possible.  But it

would be very disingenuous to behave as if the identification

of Mr. McVeigh as a suspect has been some minor sideline in

these stories.  It has been the story.

    Mr. McVeigh has been the story since he was moved from

Perry, Oklahoma; and certainly since his apprehension, the

                                                       

papers and video media have been saturated with stories about

him, about the militia, about his family, about other groups

all tending to lead or lend some larger conspiracy or larger

connection, which is the tendency of all of these facts, that

are being presented as fact in various media.

    Your Honor, it would be very difficult, I think even under

the best of circumstances, if we all were from some place else

and, well, all been dropped here in the middle of Oklahoma City

to conduct these proceedings, to be unaware of what has been

going on in Oklahoma for the last week or week and a day.  It

would be very, very difficult to find anyone in America who

doesn't know something, at least, about this.

    But to say that the publicity is not a factor, to say that

publicity is not a factor right at this point, just simply is

untenable.  That is a tenable position to take and tenable

position to maintain.

    Further compounding that is the fact that we don't really

have to rely on all of this media coverage.  We don't have to

rely on the video pictures and on television and Connie Chung

standing there with a bombed-ut building in the background.  We

know what it looks like because we were all there and we all

saw it.  We heard it.  We smelled it.  We lived through it.  We

are percipient witnesses.  Every one of us is a percipient

witness to this event.  And Mr. McVeigh has the right to have

his case heard even at this initial proceeding.  This is not

                                                       

some sideline, some procedural sideline.

    This is an essential part of this criminal case, and

Mr. McVeigh is entitled under the Federal Rules of Criminal

Procedure and under the Constitution to have his case heard

from the very first instance by neutral and detached people who

were not themselves percipient witnesses.

    The government says, "You can't cite any cases.  You can't

cite any cases."  You are darned right I can't cite any cases

because this hasn't happened before.

    You must not let the fact that this is a unique situation

in which there is no case precedent cripple us to the obvious

and indisputable facts.  We are not people who come to this

with perhaps some notion of what went on.  Because we are

percipient witnesses, we have our own very personal idea of

what happened because we saw it, and we were there.  That is

why Mr. Coyle and I filed the motion to transfer at this time,

so that this preliminary hearing could be conducted in another

venue, in front of another magistrate, in front of another

judge, one who wasn't run out of the courthouse by this blast,

and Mr. McVeigh to be represented by lawyers who do not

personally know victims involved in this, to be represented by

a lawyer whose office wasn't largely destroyed by this blast,

and to be heard in a truly neutral and detached forum.

    I urge the Court to reconsider its position with regard to

the motion to transfer.  This is not an instance where

                                                       

Mr. Coyle and I are saying we want to be released because we

were upset.

    We want to be released because we believe it is

Constitutionally required.  Right from the very beginning,

Mr. McVeigh is entitled to have this case considered by someone

other than the persons who lived through these events.

    It's the thrust of our motion.  It wasn't really addressed

by the government in its response, and I certainly wanted to

clarify those points in the Court's order where I felt the

Court might have been lacking some additional information.  I

strongly urge the Court to reconsider all of these matters.

         THE COURT:  Any objections to Defendant's Exhibit Nos.

1 through 6?

         MR. GARLAND:  No, Your Honor.

         THE COURT:  The same are admitted without objection.

    Does the United States have any response to the Defendant's

counsel's statement?

         MR. GARLAND:  Yes, Your Honor, with respect to the 

 Motion to Transfer, as the Government's papers show, the rule 

 is only for transfer from the district for trial.  

         As Charles Allen Wright wrote in his seminal book, 

 Federal Practice and Procedure, the District Court is not 

 authorized by this rule to transfer proceedings before the 

 return of the Indictment.  

         No case, no Court has ever made such a transfer that 

 has ever been recorded.  Part of the reason may well be that 

 because, although Mr. McVeigh may wish to transfer, there are 

 others who are still being sought.  Those people have the 

 Constitutional right to a trial in the state where the crimes 

 have been committed, by the jury in the state and in the 

 district where the crimes were committed.  Without their waiver 

 it would make it impossible for the grand jury to proceed

 against those individuals.  For that reason, then, we believe 

 the Court's decision against transfer at this time is correct. 

         However, Your Honor, in light of the attorney's 

 statement, I have to once again ask the Court on the record to 

 ask the Defendant whether or not he objects to continuing with 

 this hearing with his current lawyers.  

         I am concerned, Your Honor, that at some later time 

 he will say that he did not consent; that she has made 

 statements today that some day would be used to suggest later 

 that the hearing went along without his consent.  He does not 

 have any right to not make a statement with respect to whether 

 he consents to going forward at this time.  At the least Your 

 Honor ought to advise the Defendant that if he does not object, 

 his objection will be taken as consent to continuing with these 

 attorneys for whatever purposes for today.  

         THE COURT:  The Court has carefully considered the 

 statements of counsel here today and oral statements which 

 supplement the motion which they previously filed.  The Court, 

 as I tried to indicate in my statement earlier about the 

 relationship between the retained counsel and appointed 

 counsel, the Court has to exercise oversight in connection with 

 that.  The Court has no question that the present counsel who 

 are appearing for the Defendant will serve very professionally 

 and respectfully and competently.  

         The Court's order stated that their Motion to 

 Withdraw was overruled without prejudice, so that matter can be 

 reconsidered.  Other than that, in connection with the evidence 

 which has been introduced, the Court believes the order 

 satisfactorily resolved those issues.  I tried to be as 

 specific as I could in connection with the order in the limited 

 amount of time that we have all had to work on all of this, and 

 I believe the order is sufficiently dispositive to deal with 

 those issues.  The record has been made, as far as I'm 

 concerned, on those points.  The order that I previously 

 entered is sustained and will continue in effect. 

         If there is nothing further, I will consider evidence 

 on the probable cause issue. 

         MR. GARLAND:  Your Honor, I still think we need to 

 know whether the Defendant consents to going forward with these 

 attorneys at this time.
         THE COURT:  Well, it is basically the Court's 

 responsibility to, as I said, exercise oversight in connection 

 with the appointment of counsel.  As compared to an entry of 

 appearance by a privately-retained attorney, the Court has 

 little or no discretion in connection with that matter.  You 

 heard the positions of the attorneys who are present and the 

 Court has exercised its judgment and oversight, which I think

 I'm required to do in connection with 3005.  Ms. Otto and 

 Mr. Coyle meet every qualification.  The Court believes that 

 they are professional-enough attorneys that they will 

 competently represent the Defendant throughout this proceeding, 

 which we all agree is narrowly focused.  The only issue at this 

 time is probable cause.  We are not going to determine whether 

 the Defendant is guilty or innocent; simply probable cause and 

 reasonable basis. 

         MR. GARLAND:  May I state for the record that I have 

 heard no objection to the Defendant proceeding with these 

 counsel. 

         THE COURT:   Basically it is the Court's decision.  

 The Court believes that the representation will be both 

 professional and competent. 

         MR. GARLAND:  The United States would call Special 

 Agent Jon Hersley.

         THE COURT:  Mr. Hersley, step forward, face the 

 Clerk, raise your right hand and be sworn. 

                     DIRECT EXAMINATION

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   What caused the explosion of the Murrah Building?

 A.   A bomb.

 Q.   Have the experts informed you as to where the bomb was 

 located at the time it went off?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Please describe that to the Court. 

 A.   It was located inside a Ryder Truck that was parked in 

 front of the Murrah Building on the north side.

 Q.   How did the experts know that?

 A.   Due to the uniqueness of the blast damage that was 

 suffered on certain components of the truck, they are able to 

 tell that it was actually located inside that truck.

 Q.   Has an effort been made to trace that Ryder Truck to the 

 point of which it was rented?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   What methods are used to trace that truck?

 A.   There was a portion of the vehicle identification number 

 that was located and we were able to trace from that portion 

 the full vehicle identification number and then take that on to 

 determine who actually had the vehicle.

 Q.   In addition to the vehicle identification number, or VIN 

 number, was there another part of the truck that permitted 

 tracing?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   What was that?

 A.   The license plate.

 Q.   I have marked what will be called Government's Exhibit 1 

 for identification and I am showing it to defense counsel.   

    Do you recognize Government's Exhibit 1?

 A.   Yes, I do.

 Q.   What is Government's Exhibit 1?

 A.   This is the Florida license plate that was on the Ryder 

 Truck.

         MR. GARLAND:  Your Honor, the Government moves 

 Exhibit 1 into evidence.

         THE COURT:  Any objection?

         MR. COYLE:  No objection.

         THE COURT:  The same will be admitted.

 Q.   You said that by using the vehicle identification number 

 and the license plate, that you were able to trace the truck to 

 a rental location; is that correct?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   What was the result of that tracing?

 A.   The Elliott's Body Shop in Junction City, Kansas.

 Q.   Was the rental agent at that location interviewed?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Did he advise as to when that truck was rented?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   When was that?

 A.   The truck was rented on April 17th of this year.

 Q.   By how many people?

 A.   One person filled out the rental agreement; there was 

 another individual with that person when they picked it up.

 Q.   What did the individual who filled out the rental 

 agreement provide on the rental agreement?

 A.   Provided his name. 

 Q.   Did he provide any other identifying information?

 A.   Yes, I believe a Social Security account number, as well 

 as a driver's license and also his address.

 Q.   Was an effort made to trace the Social Security number or 

 driver's license and address?  

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   What was the result of that tracing?

 A.   They were both his numbers.

 Q.   Did the rental agent assist in the creation of a composite 

 drawing of the individual who rented the truck?

 A.   Yes.

         MR. GARLAND:  Your Honor, I have what has been marked 

 as Government's Exhibit 2 for identification.

    (Government's counsel displays Exhibit 2 to counsel.) 

 Q.   Do you recognize Government's Exhibit 2?

 A.   Yes, I do.

 Q.   What is Government's Exhibit 2?

 A.   This is the composite drawing that was prepared.

 Q.   It was prepared with the information provided by who?

 A.   By the employee at the Elliott's Body Shop.

 Q.   Did he advise the FBI as to whether that composite drawing 

 was a fair and accurate representation of the person that 

 rented the truck?

 A.   Yes, he said it was.

         MR. GARLAND:  I offer Government's Exhibit 2 into 

 evidence.

         MR. COYLE:  No objection.

         THE COURT:  Exhibit No. 2 is admitted with no 

 objection.

         MR. GARLAND:  I ask the Court to take its own notice 

 as to its resemblance to the Defendant.

 Q.   (By Mr. Garland)  Mr. Hersley, is there also a hotel named 

 the Dreamland Hotel in Junction City, Kansas?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Had interviewing been done at that hotel?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   What did people at the hotel advise the agents?

 A.   That an individual had checked into the hotel on April 

 14th of this year.

 Q.   How long did he stay?

 A.   Until April 18th.

 Q.   Was any connection made between the individual and the 

 representation in Exhibit 2?

 A.   Yes.

 A.   The individual at the hotel advised that the individual 

 that had stayed at the Dreamland Hotel between April 14th and 

 April 18th of this year strongly resembled the composite 

 picture.

 Q.   What name did he register under at the hotel?

 A.   Tim McVeigh.

 Q.   Did he provide an address?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   What was that address?

 A.   3616 North Van Dyke in Decker, Michigan.

 Q.   Was he seen driving any automobile at the time?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   What kind of automobile?

 A.   A yellow Mercury.

 Q.   What room did he register in at the hotel?

 A.   Room 25.

 Q.   Were the employees at the Dreamland -- were any employees 

 at the Dreamland shown a photo spread which included a picture 

 of Mr. McVeigh?

 A.   Yes.  

 Q.   What was the result of that photo identification?

 A.   The employee positively identified the picture depicting 

 Timothy McVeigh as being the person that stayed at the room on 

 that occasion.

 Q.   What was that room?

 A.   Room 25.

 Q.   Was an analysis made of telephone calls from the Dreamland 

 Motel during that period?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Was there a call on April 15th --

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   -- from Room 25?

 A.   Yes, there was.

 Q.   Is that the same room that Mr. McVeigh was registered in?

 A.   That's correct.

 Q.   Where was that call made to?

 A.   To a local restaurant in Junction City.

 Q.   Have you examined the receipt of the restaurant for that 

 date?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   What does it show?

 A.   It shows that the order was placed by an individual using 

 the name "Kling."

 Q.   Is "Kling" the same name as on the Ryder Truck form?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Did it show what room number the order came from?

 A.   Yes, Room 25.

 Q.   Was a photo spread shown to the delivery man?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Was he able to identify Mr. McVeigh?

 A.   No.

 Q.   On April 17th, that was the day that the Ryder Truck was 

 rented; is that correct?

 A.   That's correct.

 Q.   Did any Dreamland employee see Mr. McVeigh?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   In what connection did they see him?

 A.   They saw him arrive at the Dreamland Motel driving the 

 Ryder Truck.

 Q.   On April 18, the following day, did any employee of the 

 Dreamland Motel see Mr. McVeigh?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   How did they see him then?

 A.   At approximately 4 a.m., Mr. McVeigh was observed in the 

 Ryder Truck.

 Q.   Later in the day did they again see Mr. McVeigh in the 

 Ryder Truck?

 A.   No.

 Q.   Now, in Paragraph 6 of the Affidavit that was attached to 

 the Complaint in this case there is a discussion of three 

 witnesses who identified a person in Exhibit 2, the composite, 


 as having been in the vicinity of the Murrah Building on the 

 morning of the explosion; is that correct?

 A.   Yes, it is.

 Q.   Have those people been able to confirm that they saw the 

 Defendant, Tim McVeigh?

 A.   No.

 Q.   On April 19th, is that the date of the bomb?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   About how long after the blast was that?

 A.   Approximately one-and-a-half hours.

 Q.   Where was the stop?

 A.   Near Perry, Oklahoma.

 Q.   Approximately how long of a drive is it from the Murrah 

 Building to Perry, Oklahoma?

 A.   Less than an hour-and-a-half.

 Q.   I want to show you what has been marked as Government's 

 Exhibit 3 for identification.  

  (Government's counsel displays Exhibit 3 to counsel.)  

 Q.   (By Mr. Garland)  Do you recognize Government's Exhibit 3?

 A.   Yes, I do.

 Q.   What is Government's Exhibit 3?

 A.   It is a Michigan driver's license in the name of Timothy 

 James McVeigh.

 Q.   Where was it obtained?

 A.   From Mr. McVeigh.

 A.   It is an explosive that is commonly used in detonating

 cord.

         MR. GARLAND:  The Government has no further 

 questions.  

         I would like to move into evidence Government's 

 Exhibit 3.

         MR. COYLE:  No objection to the introduction of 

 Government's Exhibit 3.

         THE COURT:  Admitted without objection. 

         MR. GARLAND:  Thank you.

         THE COURT:  Cross-examine.

         MR. COYLE:  Thank you.  

                      CROSS-EXAMINATION

 BY MR. COYLE:

 Q.   Good afternoon, Agent Hersley. 

 A.   Good afternoon.

 Q.   Would you tell me, please, sir, if prior to the time that 

 you came to court to testify today if you reviewed any papers 

 or documents to refresh your recollection in preparing your 

 testimony here before the Court?

 A.   No.

 Q.   So you haven't read any official documents in connection 

 with this case to prepare for your testimony?

 A.   Not to prepare for my testimony, I have not.

 Q.   Did you discuss any of the documents or anything other 

 than the exhibits that have been introduced into evidence in 

 court today with any of the Assistant United States Attorneys 

 involved in the case prior to your testimony?

 A.   I don't believe so.

 Q.   Can you tell me, please, sir, the agents that you have 

 spoken with to obtain the information that you have testified 

 to in a hearsay fashion before the Court today?

 A.   Primarily Rick Hahn.

 Q.   Rick?

 A.   Rick Hahn --

 Q.   Okay. 

 A.   -- from the FBI; numerous agents during the course of the 

 investigation, as it is ongoing.  I also spoke with another 

 individual that is a bomb tech for the FBI.

 Q.   What is his name?

 A.   I spoke with an individual from the Medical Examiner's 

 office.  I spoke with agents in Junction City, Kansas and other 

 agents throughout the Country.

 Q.   Now, can you tell us, please, sir, what your role has been 

 in the investigation?

 A.   Yes, I have been assisting in the investigation in regard 

 to Mr. McVeigh.  I have also been participating in the ongoing 

 investigation in an attempt to further identify and locate 

 other individuals who may have been involved in the bombing on 

 April 19th, 1995. 

 Q.   In your assistance in the investigation, what has been 

 your primary role?  Have you been a keeper of evidence, a maker 

 of calls, what has been your primary role?

 A.   I have done both of those things, as well as numerous 

 other things.  If you refer to a keeping of the original 

 evidence, I have not been involved in actually handling the 

 original evidence.  I have been involved in tracking and 

 keeping up with copies of that evidence insofar as

 further-leading investigation material is concerned.   Also in

 coordinating the efforts of other FBI offices in the ongoing 

 investigation in an attempt to identify the additional people 

 that were involved in the bombing that tried to prohibit anyone 

 else from getting injured or killed.

 Q.   So am I correct that you more or less have been involved 

 in all phases of the investigation --

 A.   Pretty much so.

 Q.   -- to date?

 A.   Pretty much.

 Q.   Is that the way it is with all of the special agents of 

 the FBI on this investigation, they have handled all different 

 aspects?  They call agents -- every agent is calling agents all 

 over the Country, tagging in evidence and looking at it and 

 making sure that all of this is kept track of; is that right?

 A.   No, that's not really an accurate depiction of what is 

 taking place.  The agents have been given certain assignments 

 and certain responsibilities and they have been going about 

 carrying them out.

 Q.   Tell us, please, sir, so that I can specify what it is you 

 have been involved in, could you tell us, please, what, for 

 instance, your activities were on the day of Wednesday, April 

 19th?  What was your specific assignment on that date?  I 

 assume you had something specific. 

 A.   On April 19th, as most of the FBI agents in Oklahoma City 

 were sent down to the vicinity of the Murrah Building after the 

 bomb blast, I was charged with staying in the office to help 

 communicate the activities of everyone concerned on that date.  

 As it has evolved, I have been responsible primarily for 

 keeping up with the activities of Mr. McVeigh.

 Q.   Are you talking about on the 19th?

 A.   No. 

 Q.   I believe that was my question, just on the 19th.  

    Now, is that what you did on the 19th?  You were on the 

 phone and you never left the office?

 A.   Primarily, yes.

 Q.   Now it is my understanding on the 19th at some point the 

 offices of the FBI were evacuated here in Oklahoma City; is 

 that correct?

 A.   Evacuated, except for certain personnel.

 Q.   You were one of those who stayed behind, sir?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Now, can you tell us, please, sir, what your primary 

 responsibility and assignment was on April 20th, that would be 

 Thursday?

 A.   Pretty much the same as it was on the 19th. 

 Q.   So once again you were there at the offices of the FBI?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Was your job there -- that's the offices at 50 Penn Place, 

 not this Command Post we have heard of, right?

 A.   It is at 50 Penn Place, yes.

 Q.   Your obligations on the 20th were placing calls to other 

 places in the Country?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Would that be based upon evidence that people would bring 

 you or tell you about that had been found in the field or tell 

 us how that worked on the 20th?

 A.   We would get information about evidence that had been 

 found in various locations that would require that we send out 

 and conduct additional investigation both here in Oklahoma City 

 and other locations throughout the Country.  So I would be 

 responsible for help overseeing the continued investigation in 

 that regard to help identify other individuals who may have 

 been involved.

 Q.   On the 21st, on Friday?

 A.   The same thing on Friday and the same thing on Saturday. 

 Q.   So essentially am I correct, sir, that all of your duties 

 from the date of the 19th through the 21st were in the offices 

 of the FBI at 50 Penn Place in Oklahoma City?

 A.   Pretty much so, yes.

 Q.   Now beginning on Sunday, can you tell us, please, what 

 your duties were?

 A.   I believe that's the day that I started reporting over to 

 the -- Sunday or Monday I started reporting over to the Command 

 Post that was set up and was then responsible for the 

 investigation as it pertained to Mr. McVeigh.

 Q.   So am I correct, then, that you have been the agent in 

 charge, then, of the investigation as it pertains to the 

 accused, Timothy McVeigh?

 A.   I have been responsible for keeping up with the 

 investigation regarding Mr. McVeigh, that's correct. 

 Q.   Explain to us what "keeping up" means?

 A.   There is a number of leads that have been -- are being 

 carried out in the continuing investigation.  I keep track of 

 that investigation.  I keep track of certain evidence that has 

 been found -- although not the actual, physical custody of that 

 evidence; I want to clarify that.  I am provided with copies of 

 documents and other records that are -- have been located.  We 

 are cataloging those documents, keeping up with the 

 investigation that is going on in other offices of the FBI, 

 including talking to agents that are conducting investigations 

 in those offices regarding what they have been able to 

 determine and future investigation to be conducted. 

 Q.   Now, is this material all logged into a computer, then?

 A.   Portions of it.

         MR. GARLAND:  Objection, Your Honor.  We are well 

 beyond the scope of a probable cause hearing.  The 

 determination of the way in which the FBI goes about the 

 investigation is not a proper subject for discovery.

         THE COURT:  Overruled.  

         You may answer the question.

         MR. COYLE:  I asked if he has been logging these 

 matters, these clues, this evidence that he has looked at, 

 these kinds of things that he has testified to.

         THE COURT:  I don't believe he answered the 

 question.  Did he answer that question? 

         MR. COYLE:  No, it was objected to.

         THE COURT:  I overruled it. 

         Do you want him to answer the question?

         THE WITNESS:  Could you repeat the question? 

         MR. COYLE:  I knew he would ask me that. 

 Q.   (By Mr. Coyle)  In the course of your investigation and 

 during the time particularly that you moved to the Command 

 Post -- and I will get back to the other place -- but since you 

 have been at the Command Post -- that's what it is called.  You 

 understand what I'm talking about by "Command Post"? 

 A.   Yes, I do.

 Q.   Since you have been at that particular location, as you 

 get leads, as you get copies of evidence, photocopies or 

 photographs of evidence, have you then taken those and logged 

 them into a computer?

 A.   No, I don't do that.  Some of the documents and the 

 results of the interviews are being logged into a computer.  

 That is being done by other personnel at that location and 

 other locations. 

 Q.   So your job is to just take a look and keep track of all 

 of the evidence and then you assign other FBI agents out to do 

 other tasks or to make calls?

 A.   There are other agents that are assigned to the same types 

 of duties that I am there in regard to other potential 

 individuals that were involved in the bombing.  I also 

 coordinate with those individuals insofar as information that 

 is received regarding Mr. McVeigh, in an effort to identify 

 some of the other subjects that were involved in the bombing 

 here in Oklahoma City.  

    That's our primary focus right now is to try to determine 

 the identity and the location of the other subjects so that we 

 can prohibit another bomb from going off.

 Q.   You told us in your direct examination by Mr. Garland that 

 you had consulted with explosive experts; is that correct?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Can you tell me who those were?

 A.   Rick Hahn, and I believe the other individuals -- one of 

 the other individuals is Bill Jockney.

 Q.   Who is Rick Hahn?

 A.   He is an FBI bomb expert that has been qualified to 

 testify in cases and has testified on numerous occasions in 

 cases across the Country.

 Q.   Can you tell me where your conversations with Mr. Hahn -- 

 Agent -- is it Agent Hahn --

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   -- or is he a technician?

 A.   No, he is an agent.

 Q.   Where your conversations with Agent Hahn took place?

 A.   Primarily at the Command Post.

 Q.   Were other persons present during those conversations?

 A.   During some of the conversations.

 Q.   Can you tell me when those took place?

 A.   Over the last couple of days.

       (AFTER THE RECESS, THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD

IN OPEN COURT.

         THE COURT:  Let the record show that all parties are

present and the defendant is present.

         MR. COYLE:  May I have just a minute?

         THE COURT:  Sure.  Let the record show that counsel

are present.    The defendant is present in person, and you may

proceed with cross-examination.

BY MR. COYLE:

Q.  Agent Hersley, do you have any indication or have but been

advised that any individuals saw the Ryder Truck explode?

A.  Primarily the information that I have is that people saw

the Ryder Truck shortly before the explosion.  I don't know of

anybody by name myself that actually saw the explosion and

lived through it.

Q.  Okay, so --

A.  There are people inside the building that made it through

obviously and would have seen the explosion or parts of it.

Q.  Well, I don't think my question to you is theoretical.  Are

you aware of a witness that you know their name and might be

available and alive to testify in court?  That's a better

question that saw the Ryder Truck explode.

A.  Not that I can recall right now.

Q.  That would be someone pretty important and you're privy to

that kind of information, correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Now, is there any pictorial or visual recording of the

vehicle parked over the crater, the site what you say is the

site of the explosion?

A.  I don't believe there is a picture actually where that

crater is.  There are other pictures of the Ryder Truck on that

street.

Q.  And where is the Ryder Truck located at the time of the

pictures?

A.  Heading east on Fifth Street towards that location.

Q.  It's shown heading east?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And can you see the tag on the pictures?

A.  No.

Q.  So you say there is film available that shows the -- a

Ryder Truck in an easterly direction that is traveling in an

easterly direction on Fifth Street?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Is it past the street that we know as Harvey?

A.  I am not -- I have not studied that film in detail.  It's

in that general vicinity right in there.  It may be the video

that I saw.  I believe it is just before -- well, I am not

sure.  I better not say that.

Q.  Well, Harvey Street --

A.  I don't know.

Q.  Harvey Street is the street that is immediately west of the

Murrah Building?

A.  That is correct.

Q.  Are the photographs that you saw or is it still photo or

film?

A.  What I saw was the still photos.

Q.  Is it a still photo that has been removed from a film?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Were those still photos that you saw, do those appear to

you to be east of the street that we know as Harvey?

A.  I was not focusing on that picture to determine whether or

not -- whether it was east or west of Harvey.  It was in that

general location.  I can say that.

Q.  So it was a closeup more of the truck than its location?

A.  It wasn't a closeup photo, it was taken from a camera off

one of the buildings in the vicinity.

Q.  Did you make a determination of what building it came off

of?

A.  No, I did not myself.

Q.  Okay, did anyone?

A.  I believe one of the other agents was able to determine

that it came from one -- one of the films came from the Regency

Tower Apartments.

Q.  Can you tell in the photograph who is driving the truck?

A.  No.

Q.  And is the truck parked or is it moving?

A.  As I mentioned, I saw the still photographs of the picture

or the footage was frozen at this time when a still photograph

was made, but I believe the truck due to the continuation of

the still photographs that the truck was moving in an easterly

direction.

Q.  That is also a one-way street there from west to east, am I

correct, sir?

A.  That is correct.

Q.  What was the size of the truck that you saw in the

photographs?

A.  I could not tell myself exactly what the size was from the

photograph that I saw, but I would estimate it from what I saw

to be approximately 20 feet.

Q.  Was there a time indicated on the picture of the film that

you saw?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  Okay, can you tell us, please, sir, what that time was?

A.  It was in the proximity of 9:00 a.m.  As I mentioned, I did

not study the photographs in great detail, and I don't know the

exact time on the photographs, but it was in the proximity of

9:00 a.m.

Q.  Can you tell us when you viewed those photographs, please,

sir?

A.  I believe within the last two to three days.

Q.  I believe you told me earlier that the license tag is not

visible on the photographs; is that correct, sir?

A.  Not visible on the photographs that I have seen, that is

correct.

Q.  Are you aware of any other photographs in which the license

tag might be visible?

A.  No, except for the recovery, and I am not aware of that

being on the bumper.  I would presume there are photographs

taken there.

Q.  Well, I understand that it has been photographed by the FBI

and the way that we see it.

         MR. COYLE:  May I approach?

         THE COURT:  Yes.

BY MR. COYLE:

A.  Yes.

Q.  As we see it as Government Exhibit No. 1.  But aside from

Government Exhibit No. 1, are you aware of any other

photographs aside from those photographs taken of it by the FBI

subsequent to its retrieval after the time of the explosion.

Are you aware of any photographs of a license tag prior to the

time of the explosion in front of the Murrah Building?

A.  No.

Q.  Are you aware of any photographs that were taken at any

time prior to the explosion at the Murrah Building of the

accused Timothy McVeigh in or about the truck that you have

described as a Ryder rental?

A.  No.

Q.  And I include in that, so we don't have a semantical

difficulty of any sort -- any sort of photographs, film

footage, surveillance cameras, any other film of any type that

you are aware of, Agent, that shows the accused Timothy McVeigh

anywhere in the vicinity of the Murrah Building on April 19,

1995 at or before 9:00 a.m.

A.  No.

Q.  9:03 a.m. -- at or before 9:03 a.m.

A.  That is correct.

Q.  "No" is your answer?

A.  Yes.

Q.  I believe you told us in a previous answer that there is no

visual or pictorial record of the vehicle parked over the bomb

-- over the site where you say it exploded in front of the

Murrah Building?

A.  Not that I have seen.  I have not viewed all of the film of

that location on that morning, so I can't speak to that

entirely, but I have not seen it.

Q.  Have you been advised that that photograph exists.  Have

you been told about that in your capacity as an agent working

there at the command post?

A.  No.

Q.  That would be something as an agent working on the case and

particularly you told us at the outset that your

responsibilities were in regard to Mr. McVeigh; am I correct?

A.  Yes, and his activities.

Q.  And that would be something -- the movement of the Ryder

Truck and its location is something particularly important to

which the government would be concerned in regard to Mr.

McVeigh; am I correct?

A.  Yes, you are correct as there are many other things that

the government is concerned about and different agents are

assigned different responsibilities as this is a fast moving

investigation possibly involving more subjects that may have

been involved in the bombing.  So other agents have been

assigned responsibilities in regard to any films or pictures

that may be retrieved for viewing purposes.

Q.  Well, how did you see the ones that you have testified

about here earlier?  Did you happen to see them laying on a

desk and look at them or did someone bring them to your

attention?  How did you see those?

A.  One of the agents that have been tasked with those

responsibilities showed me those photographs.

Q.  Now, I assume -- who are those agents that are tasked with

the responsibility of reviewing photographs and film footage?

         MR. GARLAND:  Objection, Your Honor, this is now

purely speculative.

         THE COURT:  Overruled.

BY MR. COYLE:

A.  The agent that showed me the photographs was Walt Lamar.

Q.  Is he a local agent here?

A.  Yes, he is.

Q.  Is he known to you as a photographic expert?

A.  No, he is not.  He is not known to me as that.

Q.  And is he the one that you inquired of as to whether or not

there were any photographs of the accused, Mr. Timothy McVeigh

in possession of the government at or about the Ryder Truck?

You asked him that question I assume; did you not?

A.  I did not inquire of Agent Lamar about these photographs.

He brought it to my attention because there is a possibility of

a particular car being involved in one of those photographs

that he was showing me.  We are continuing investigation to try

to determine the actual identity of that car.

Q.  What did that car look like in the photograph?

         MR. GARLAND:  Objection, Your Honor, we were going in

the area of discovery now.

         THE COURT:  Sustained.

BY MR. COYLE:

Q.  In the photograph concerning the other vehicle or anything

in any of the surveillance photographs that you have seen

exclude the Ryder Truck, not only around the Ryder Truck?  Have

you seen Mr. McVeigh in any of the other photographs period in

or about the area of the Murrah Building?

A.  No.

Q.  Now, you told us that there were witnesses that saw the

vehicle at or near the scene of the explosion.  I am talking

about the Ryder Truck, that saw the Ryder Truck that; do you

recall testifying to that earlier?

A.  There are witnesses that have advised that they saw the

Ryder Truck in the vicinity of the Murrah Building on that

morning, yes.

Q.  And have those witnesses viewed Mr. McVeigh?

A.  Have they viewed him?

Q.  Yes, in sort of a photo line up or live line up.  Any of

those witnesses who say they saw the Ryder Truck?

A.  Yes. Well, to say they saw the Ryder Truck, I don't believe

that those individuals have been involved in a line up.

Q.  Okay, how many individuals are you aware of agent Hersley

that saw the Ryder Truck at the scene of the explosion?

A.  At the actual seen as opposed to in the vicinity.

Q.  At the actual place, the site of the explosion.

         MR. GARLAND:  Objection, Your Honor, again goes to

discovery of other witnesses in the matter.   It doesn't go to

the probable cause.

         THE COURT:  Overruled.

BY MR. COYLE:

A.  One or two.

Q.  You are not sure?

A.  I know of one.  There are other agents that have been

interviewing potential witnesses that may have sighted the

Ryder Truck in that vicinity.  There are other, still other

agents that have interviewed people who saw the Ryder Truck in

the vicinity of the Murrah Building on that morning.

Q.  So you know of one witness who says they saw the truck at

the location where you have told the Court you have been

advised that it exploded; am I correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Did you interview that person?

A.  No, he was interviewed by another agent.

Q.  Do you know the location of that other person at the time

that he viewed the truck and the location that you have

described for us?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Can you tell us, please?

A.  He was driving his vehicle east on Fifth Street and passed

right along beside the vehicle.

Q.  How long or how much time passed between the time that the

witness told you that he saw the Ryder Truck and the explosion?

A.  Maybe a minute or two.

Q.  How far was his vehicle -- had the witness's vehicle

travelled?

A.  When the bomb went off, that witness indicated that he was

between Robinson and Broadway on Fifth Street.

Q.  Has he been shown to your knowledge a photo lineup of the

accused Timothy McVeigh?

A.  He has not been shown a photo lineup.

Q.  Has the FBI prepared a photo lineup that include the

picture of Timothy McVeigh?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Have you viewed that --

A.  Yes.

Q.  -- photo lineup?

A.  Yes, I have.

Q.  Does the witness that you have told us saw the truck in

that position, has that witness viewed Mr. McVeigh in a live

lineup?

A.  No.

Q.  Can you tell us why not?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.

A.  We are in the process of getting the line up shown to

different individuals as well trying to correlate all of the

other investigation with the other offices in an effort to try

to identify the other subjects that were involved in the

bombing.  That is a priority of ours in order to try to if

other people are involved get them identified and take them

into custody to try to prohibit another bomb going off in

another area or other citizens being injured or killed.

Q.  Well, eyewitness testimony, you would agree me, with fades

during the passage of the time; does it not?

A.  To some extent.

Q.  It's extremely important if you want to identify somebody,

that you show them the picture as soon as you can, don't you?

A.  As soon as reasonably possible, yes.

Q.  And a person who said he saw the Ryder Truck there has

never been shown any photographs of the accused in any way?

A.  He was shown a composite that was drawn up, the composite

that we have testified about and he identified that composite

as strongly identifying the individual that he saw at the

scene.


         MR. COYLE:  May I approach the witness, Your Honor?

         THE COURT:  Yes.

BY MR. COYLE:

Q.  Are we talking about Government Exhibit No. 2?

A.  Yes.

Q.  The composite photograph?

A.  Yes.

Q.  He was shown that photograph?

A.  Yes.

Q.  I am sorry.  That drawing?

A.  This composite?

Q.  That's the witness that you have been telling us about that

was driving by there?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And he said that to you.  What were the words that he used;

do you remember?

A.  I wasn't there.

Q.  So you don't know if he used strongly resembled or exactly

what he said?

A.  The agent that talked to him said that he strongly

resembled whether that was actually the words of the witness.

I was not present.

Q.  Where did -- and as I understand you are involved, your

involvement has been in the investigation of Timothy McVeigh.

Where did this witness, the first witness you have told us

about say that he saw the composite or a person that strongly

resembled the person in the composite in relation to the Ryder

Truck?

A.  He was walking from the south side of Fifth Street by where

the truck was parked in a northerly direction across Fifth

Street.

 Q.   So he was walking directly across Fifth Street?

 A.   He was walking away from the truck, the area where the 

 truck was located.

 Q.   Well, he was walking -- I'm not trying to be confusing -- 

 if he is walking north, he is walking across Fifth Street.  Am 

 I correct?

 A.   That's what I testified.

 Q.   Is that what the witness has told the agent that he saw, 

 what has been identified there as John Doe No. 1, I think, is 

 that what it says on Government's Exhibit 2?  Am I correct, is 

 that Government's Exhibit 2?

 A.   Yes, it is.

 Q.   On Government's Exhibit 2, he saw him walk across the 

 street, across Fifth Street?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Did he walk in front of the vehicle or behind the vehicle 

 of the witness?

         MR. GARLAND:  Objection, Your Honor, as we are not 

 relying on identification at the time of the bombing for 

 probable cause.  This is purely for discovery.  We have an 

 ongoing investigation.  We need to protect our witnesses for 

 the purpose of determining what happened.  We are not relying 

 on this witness for the purpose of probable cause.  All we are 

 doing here is discovery.

         MR. COYLE:  May I respond?  I have two responses.  

 First of all, he testified to it in direct examination, which I 

 think makes it an appropriate subject to cross.  

         Secondly, it was also in the Affidavit that bears 

 Your Honor's initials.  I think that is very important that 

 the Court has already considered that matter for purposes of 

 probable cause.  I think as to the weight of the evidence, the 

 Court can consider the agent's answers and how these particular 

 witnesses that they have set forth in their Affidavit, how they 

 had an opportunity to observe and to see the things that are 

 set forth in the Affidavit.  That's the reason for my 

 questions.

         THE COURT:  Is that the matter stated in the 

 Affidavit at the bottom of page 2, top of page 3?

         MR. COYLE:  Yes, sir.

         THE COURT:  Objection overruled. 

 Q.   (By Mr. Coyle)  Where did the witness see him in relation 

 to the vehicle that he was driving, the witness was driving?

         MR. GARLAND:  I'm sorry to interrupt.  I want to 

 clarify.  He did not testify about this on direct.  The only 

 statement on direct was that the paragraph he is referring to 

 in the Affidavit we are not relying on for probable cause.  

 That's paragraph 6.  Those witnesses did not identify 

 Mr. McVeigh, so those are not part of what we would ask the 

 Court to look at for probable cause.  There was no testimony 

 and I asked no question about the witness that Mr. Coyle is 

 presently asking questions about.

         THE COURT:  Nonetheless it is part of the overall 

 probable cause in the case.  

 Q.   (By Mr. Coyle)  Do you understand my question, Agent 

 Hersley?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Where was the witness in relation to the person that they 

 described?

 A.   The witness was walking away from the location where the 

 truck was parked, walking across the street, across Fifth 

 Street, to the north.

 Q.   I thought the witness was in a car. 

 A.   I'm sorry, he identified the individual pictured in the 

 composite as walking away from the area where the truck was 

 parked, across Fifth Street.

 Q.   Was the person that strongly resembled the person in the 

 composite, was he in front or behind of the car that the 

 witness was driving?

 A.   He was in front of it.

 Q.   How far in front of it?

 A.   He had to slow down, as the individual he identified in 

 the composite was crossing the street, to keep from hitting 

 him.

 Q.   What was the individual wearing who was crossing the 

 street?

 A.   I don't recall the individual that was shown the composite 

 that we are speaking about describing the clothing.  He may 

 have.  As I stated, I was not present during that interview.

 Q.   That would be something pretty important to determine, 

 wouldn't it?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Now, did the witness that you have described for me, did 

 he see the person that strongly resembles the composite, did he 

 see that before or after it was released to the news media?

 A.   He saw the composite before he saw anything on television 

 or in the news media.  He later saw Mr. McVeigh on television.

 Q.   Did you or another agent of the FBI show him Mr. McVeigh 

 on television?

 A.   No.

 Q.   Did he then identify Mr. McVeigh from television?

 A.   Yes.  Once he saw Mr. McVeigh on television, he said that 

 he was certain that was the individual that was crossing the 

 street in front of him that day, that morning.  

 Q.   When did he see Mr. McVeigh on television?

 A.   Shortly after -- shortly after he had identified the 

 composite.  Not the same day; I believe it was a day or two 

 later.

 Q.   When was he shown the composite?

 A.   I don't know the exact date.  There have been numerous 

 interviews conducted in that regard.  I have not -- I cannot 

 tell you each day that each one of them was done on.

 Q.   So there have been numerous interviews conducted of this 

 particular witness?

 A.   No, there are numerous witnesses -- potential witnesses 

 and witnesses that have been interviewed.

 Q.   Now, is this witness that you have been describing for me 

 is he one of the witnesses who is described in the Affidavit 

 signed by Agent Gibbons?

 A.   No.

 Q.   You are familiar with that Affidavit that is signed by 

 Agent Gibbons, are you not?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Were you involved in the preparation of the Affidavit of 

 Probable Cause that was signed by Agent Gibbons?

 A.   No.

 Q.   Did this witness call you and tell you that he had seen 

 Mr. McVeigh on television or did he call and advise another 

 agent who told you?

 A.   He advised another agent.  He advised the agent that had 

 spoken with him the first time.

 Q.   Who was that, sir?

 A.   John Hippard.

 Q.   Is he a local agent?

 A.   Yes, he is.

 Q.   I assume you reviewed prior to your testimony here, 

 because you went over part of it, the Affidavit of Probable 

 Cause that was filed in this case, correct?

 A.   I have read it, yes.

 Q.   It talks about the interview of three witnesses who were 

 near the scene of the explosion at the A.P. Murrah Federal 

 Building prior to the detonation.  

    Where was -- they talk about the three witnesses were 

 shown a copy of the composite drawing.  Were they all shown it 

 at the same time, to your knowledge?  Or were they in separate 

 areas or all together when they were shown the photograph?

 A.   I was not present during any of those on-site interviews.  

 I don't know the exact manner in which any of those interviews 

 were actually conducted, so I'm not able to answer that.

 Q.   Can you tell me, please, the witnesses advised they 

 observed a person at approximately 8:40.  Were these persons 

 together, these three witnesses?

 A.   I don't know if they were together or not.  You mean did 

 they know each other?  Were they traveling together or --

 Q.   Well, no.  If they were in the same general vicinity or 

 same general area or if they were -- maybe they were all just 

 brought together as witnesses?

 A.   I don't know about those three witnesses, where they were 

 interviewed, exactly where they were interviewed at that 

 location.  I did not speak with that agent about those 

 interviews.

 Q.   Do you know where they were purportedly standing at the 

 time that they made the observations that were sworn to in the 

 Affidavit?

 A.   I believe that they were either at or in the Murrah 

 Building at the time of the alleged sighting.  I don't know the 

 location where they were interviewed.

 Q.   Well, I have gone from this interview location.  We have 

 determined that you don't know where they were interviewed.    

    Have you ever seen or talked to any of these three 

 witnesses?

 A.   No.  

 Q.   Have you seen reports or talked to the agents who talked 

 to them?

 A.   No, I have not.

 Q.   Do you know where the witnesses, these witnesses -- the 

 three witnesses in paragraph 6 located at the bottom of page 2 

 and the top of page 3 of the Affidavit of Probable Cause filed 

 in this case last Friday -- do you know where those witnesses 

 were physically located at the time they told agents of the FBI 

 that they saw someone resembling a composite drawing of 

 un-sub one?

 A.   They were either at the Murrah Building or inside of it,  

 but I do not know the exact location where they were. 

 Q.   You didn't make that determination?

 A.   No.

 Q.   You didn't ask anyone?

 A.   No.

 Q.   Were they in the building at the time of the explosion?

 A.   I doubt it.

 Q.   Do you know where they were at the time of the explosion?

 A.   No, I do not.

 Q.   Didn't make that determination, either?

 A.   No.

 Q.   And you are kind of one of the agents in charge of 

 evidence against Timothy McVeigh?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   It says here they again observed un-sub one, that is this 

 photograph here that is Government's Exhibit 2; is that 

 correct?

 A.   Right.

 Q.   I'm sorry, the composite, at approximately 8:55 when they 

 departed, correct?

 A.   That's the time -- 

 Q.   The time --

 A.   Could you repeat your question?  I'm not sure of what you 

 are asking.

 Q.   Could I approach the witness?

         THE COURT:   Yes.

 Q.   (By Mr. Coyle)  What I'm doing is reading here from page 3 

 where they say they again observed un-sub one still in front of 

 the Fifth Road entrance of the building where they departed 

 minutes before the explosion. 

 A.   Okay.

 Q.   Am I correct, sir, that they left -- they told agents of 

 the FBI that they left and departed the scene of the explosion 

 approximately eight minutes prior to the time that the bomb 

 detonated?

 A.   That's correct.

 Q.   Describe for us what it was that these witnesses told 

 agents of the FBI that occurred at approximately 8:40 a.m. on 

 April 19th when they saw the person in Government's Exhibit 2 

 in front of the -- or somewhere when they entered the 

 building.  Do you know what he was allegedly doing?

 A.   No, I'm not familiar with the content of that interview, 

 with the exception that the sighting, the alleged sighting 

 occurred in or around the Murrah Federal Building that morning.

 Q.   And that they didn't see anything after 8:55, you are 

 aware of that?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Do you know whether or not this is a family or whether or 

 not they are okay or where they are located?  Do you know 

 anything about them? 

 A.   I don't know if they are a family.  I do know that they 

 are still alive.

 Q.   How do you know?

 A.   From the conversations with Agent Hippard.

 Q.   You did check to find out that much?

 A.   Yes, I spoke with Agent Hippard after these three people 

 had again been in contact with the FBI.

 Q.   Have these three people viewed Mr. McVeigh in a line-up?

 A.   No.

 Q.   Have any of these three people viewed a photographic 

 line-up of Mr. McVeigh?

 A.   No.

 Q.   So they haven't been shown a photo line-up and they didn't 

 see him in the live line-up conducted Saturday, correct?

 A.   That's correct.

 Q.   Can you tell us why not?

 A.   Yes, these three individuals had called back in after 

 viewing Mr. McVeigh on television and were not able to identify 

 him as being at the building.

 Q.   So this information that you testified earlier about these 

 three witnesses in terms of probable cause should be 

 disregarded by the Judge, then, shouldn't it?

         MR. GARLAND:  Objection, Your Honor, his testimony 

 was that these witnesses were unable to confirm.  It should not 

 be disregarded.  The purpose of that testimony -- 

         THE COURT:   The Court will make its own decision 

 about it.  Go ahead.  

 Q.   Any other witnesses, other than the ones that you said 

 that saw the man that closely resembled someone in the 

 composite crossing Fifth Street in a northerly direction prior 

 to the explosion, any other witnesses that saw someone that 

 resembled the person described in the composite identified in 

 this hearing as Government's Exhibit 2 other than the witness 

 you told us about and the three witnesses who are identified in 

 paragraph 6 of Agent Gibbons' Affidavit of Probable Cause?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Can you tell us about those?  How many of them are there, 

 please, sir?

 A.   There's at least several witnesses that have identified 

 Mr. McVeigh as closely resembling the composite photograph and 

 seeing him in the vicinity of the Murrah Building on that 

 morning.

 Q.   Can we go to several witness number one.  Tell me where 

 that witness viewed the person who you say closely resembles 

 Mr. McVeigh?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Okay.  Where was witness one?

 A.   Witness one observed the individual that she identifies as 

 strongly resembling Mr. McVeigh and identified in the 

 composite, saw Mr. McVeigh at the Federal Building 

 approximately one week before the bombing and possibly again on 

 the 17th and 18th of April.

         MR. GARLAND:  Your Honor, I really would like to once 

 again object to continuing discovery with respect to additional 

 witnesses.  We have an ongoing investigation.  The ability to 

 conduct that investigation is hampered by this.  We are not 

 relying upon identification at the time of the bombing.  It is 

 not relevant to our probable cause determination.

         THE COURT:  Overruled.  Go ahead. 

 Q.   (By Mr. Coyle)  Witness one, sir, this lady that you have 

 told us about, said she identified him from the composite?

 A.   She identified him from the composite and she identified 

 him from a photo line-up.

 Q.   Was she shown Mr. McVeigh in a live line-up?

 A.   Yes.  Excuse me, I believe it is in the live line-up 

 rather than the photo spread.  She picked him out of the live 

 line-up. 

 Q.   Am I correct, sir, that this witness does not place 

 Mr. McVeigh at the Murrah Building on the 19th day of April, 

 1995?

 A.   Yes, that's correct.

 Q.   Witness two, please, sir?

 A.   Witness two identified the composite as being identical to 

 Mr. McVeigh; saw this individual leave the scene of the bomb 

 blast shortly before the bomb went off.

 Q.   How long before the bomb went off, do you know, Agent?

 A.   Very shortly before.

 Q.   What does "very shortly" mean?

 A.   In fact the individual saw the 19 -- saw the Mercury, the 

 yellow Mercury, speeding away from the location, obviously in 

 an effort to avoid the bomb blast.

 Q.   Where did this witness see the yellow Mercury speeding 

 away?

 A.   Over in the direction -- in the parking lot, in an area 

 where the witness I had previously testified about said that 

 the individual he identified as Mr. McVeigh was walking in a 

 northerly direction towards.

 Q.   Where is that parking lot, sir?

 A.   Over on the north side of Fifth Street, close to the 

 Journal Record Building.

 Q.   It is on the north side of Fifth Street near the Journal 

 Record Building?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Is it that parking lot that we have seen in photographs 

 where there are a lot of cars that were set on fire, I believe, 

 were they not?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   This witness, this particular witness, is it a male or 

 female, sir?

 A.   Male.

 Q.   This particular male witness has indicated that he saw the 

 -- a yellow Mercury speeding away?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Did this particular witness indicate to agents of the FBI 

 how many persons were in the speeding yellow Mercury?

 A.   Two.

 Q.   Did this witness also identify the person that we know as 

 number two, un-sub two at the scene?

         MR. GARLAND:  Objection.  Un-sub two is not before 

 the Court.

         THE COURT:  The question was, did he identify un-sub 

 two? 

         MR. COYLE:  Yes.  The fact that everybody knows who 

 that is.  You understand who that is, do you not? 

         THE COURT:  The question, he objected to it.  The 

 Court sustains that objection. 

         MR. COYLE:  Yes, sir.

 Q.   Now, I think you told me that this particular -- do you 

 know where this witness was located at the time that the 

 witness made the observations that you have testified to?

 A.   Right there in that area of the Journal Record Building.

 Q.   The witness was inside the Journal Record Building?

 A.   I don't know if he was inside it or if he was standing 

 outside of it.  I believe he had observed it -- the yellow 

 Mercury, and the individual resembling the composite drawing in 

 the yellow Mercury before, at approximately 8:30 to 8:45, and 

 then he went inside the building and came back out.  That's 

 when he observed the yellow Mercury with the two individuals in 

 it speeding away from the bomb site location.

 Q.   Now, did this particular witness, you told us that he saw 

 this composite photograph, did this particular witness view the 

 photographic line-up that has been prepared by agents of the 

 FBI?

 A.   I don't know if that individual has viewed the line-up or 

 not.  As I testified, that portion of the investigation is 

 still ongoing.  I don't know exactly who has viewed it and who 

 hasn't at this point.  We have been working long hours and that 

 is an ongoing process.  I don't know exactly who has seen the 

 photo line-up.  As of yesterday, this individual had not seen 

 the photo line-up.

 Q.   Had this individual viewed Mr. McVeigh in the live 

 line-up?

 A.   No.

 Q.   Did this witness see Mr. McVeigh, did they -- the persons 

 that were listed or that they say were located in this yellow 

 Mercury, did this witness see those persons anywhere other than 

 on Fifth Street as they went east?  Did they turn on Robinson 

 or what did they do then?

 A.   The individual that the witness identified as resembling 

 the composite number one, of un-sub number one, he observed 

 that individual seated in the yellow Mercury when he was 

 outside the building the first time.   Then he went back inside 

 the building.  It was not until when he came back out the 

 second time that he saw the yellow Mercury speeding away from 

 the location.

 Q.   I assume speeding away on Fifth Street; is that correct?

 A.   Well, I think it is actually the alley area that would be 

 immediately north of Fifth Street.

 Q.   Immediately north of Fifth Street is a parking lot there.  

 Are you talking about the -- 

 A.   The north side of that parking lot.

 Q.   So the alley between the Journal Record Building and the 

 parking lot?  I'm sorry to interrupt you, I didn't mean to.  

 Are you talking about that area, that alley?

 A.   I'm talking about the area on the north side of the 

 parking lot that we have been speaking about.

 Q.   That's where you are telling the Court that the yellow 

 Mercury was speeding through that particular alley?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Was it going east or west?

 A.   I believe east.

 Q.   Witness number three -- you said you had several -- number 

 three. 

 A.   There was another witness that advised that before -- 

 approximately 20 minutes before the bomb went off, that this 

 witness observed the Ryder Truck heading south on Robinson, 

 being driven by an individual that resembles the individual 

 pictured in the composite of un-sub one.

 Q.   Was this a male or female?

 A.   Female.

 Q.   Was this female in a vehicle at the time that she observed 

 this Ryder Truck?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Was she heading in the same direction?

 A.   The Ryder Truck was heading towards her.

 Q.   So am I correct, Agent Hersley, that she said she observed 

 the Ryder Truck proceeding south on Robinson Street?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   At that time it was being driven by, you have told us, 

 someone who resembles Government's Exhibit 2, correct?

 A.   Correct.

 Q.   Did you interview this particular witness?

 A.   No, I did not interview any of the witnesses.

 Q.   I'm sorry.  

    So in the interview of this witness you say she saw the 

 truck coming toward her?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   She was in the vehicle, then, proceeding in a northerly 

 direction?

 A.   No, she was -- she was a meter maid that was at the 

 vicinity of Robinson and Park Avenue.  The Ryder Truck was 

 approaching her.  It was going at a very low rate of speed.  

 She thought the person in the Ryder Truck was going to stop and 

 ask her some questions.

 Q.   Was there -- go ahead. 

 A.   However, as it approached that intersection, the driver 

 turned west on Park Avenue and continued on and at that point 

 the meter maid was behind the truck.

 Q.   Did she get a look at the license tag on that particular 

 Ryder Truck?

 A.   I don't believe so.

 Q.   Did she view Mr. McVeigh or did she view the line-up that 

 was conducted at the Oklahoma County detention facility on 

 Saturday?

 A.   No.

 Q.   Has she looked at an FBI composite of photographs?

 A.   Yes.  She looked at this composite and advised that this 

 individual closely resembles the individual that she saw in the 

 truck.  

 Q.   Well, did you show her -- did you all put together some 

 photographs, photographic line-up?

 A.   Photo spread, yes.

 Q.   Photo spread.  In the photo spread that was prepared by 

 the FBI, I assume they have been using the same one to show 

 everybody, have they not?  The same photo spread; they haven't 

 been changing the pictures?

 A.   No, it is the same, the same line-up.

 Q.   In the photo spread, was this witness shown -- this female 

 meter maid, was she shown the photo spread?

 A.   Not as of yesterday.

 Q.   When -- what time of day did she say that she saw this 

 Ryder Truck with someone possibly resembling the composite?

 A.   Approximately 8:40 a.m.

 Q.   How many occupants were there in the vehicle, does she 

 recall?

 A.   I believe she just spoke of the one individual that was 

 driving the vehicle.

 Q.   Was she asked if there were two?

 A.   I'm not aware of that.

 Q.   Any other witnesses?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Can you tell me, please, sir?

 A.   Yes, there was another individual that observed the Ryder 

 Truck on Harvey.  I believe it was on Harvey or Hudson, also 

 not too long before the actual bomb.

 Q.   Was this a male or a female, sir?

 A.   I believe a male.  There may have been two individuals at 

 that location.  I know there was at least one male that 

 observed the Ryder Truck and the occupants of the Ryder Truck. 

 That person also advised that the individual in the truck 

 closely resembled the individual depicted in composite one.

 Q.   Did you tell me he saw occupants of a Ryder Truck and 

 there were more than one?

         MR. GARLAND:  Objection.  The only person on trial at 

 this hearing is Mr. McVeigh.  It doesn't matter whether there 

 were two or a hundred people in that truck as long as there was 

 somebody representing Mr. McVeigh there.  It is discovery and 

 totally outside the scope of this hearing.

         MR. COYLE:  May I respond?  I think it is important 

 to see if we distinguish it as the same truck or not.  I think 

 it is very important to the credibility of the witnesses and 

 credibility of the evidence and what they saw as to whether or 

 not the next person saw three or five or six or -- 

         THE COURT:  Objection overruled.  Go ahead. 

 A.   This witness advised that there were two individuals in 

 the truck.  The individual resembling Mr. McVeigh was the 

 driver.

 Q.   You said you thought this was either on Harvey or Hudson.  

 What direction was the vehicle -- were you told the vehicle was 

 traveling?

 A.   The vehicle was not traveling at that point.  It had 

 pulled into a business location there and asked for directions 

 to Fifth and Harvey.

 Q.   What was the name of that business?

 A.   I don't recall the name of it.

 Q.   You say this was a male witness?  

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Has this witness viewed Mr. McVeigh in a photo spread?

 A.   Not yet.

 Q.   How about the line-up?

 A.   I'm not certain of the line-up.

 Q.   You are not certain if this was one of the witnesses in 

 the line-up?

 A.   Yes, I'm not certain if this witness attended the line-up.

 Q.   Did not -- there were four different FBI agents at the 

 line-up, that brought witnesses in to the line-up.  Were you 

 aware of that?

 A.   No.

 Q.   You mean none of these agents told you anything about the 

 line-up that occurred on Saturday, and this is Thursday, the 

 27th of April?

 A.   That wasn't your question. 

 Q.   Well, that's my next one.  None of the agents told you?

 A.   I knew there was a line-up and I knew that individual 

 witnesses at that line-up had identified Mr. McVeigh.  I didn't 

 know that each individual witness was brought in separately by 

 a particular FBI agent.  That was your question.

 Q.   The first witnesses who came to the line-up, were you 

 advised that they did not identify Mr. McVeigh and could not 

 pick him out?

 A.   I know that there were four witnesses at the line-up and I 

 know that one witness identified Mr. McVeigh; one witness 

 picked out two individuals pictured in the line-up and said 

 that the individual they saw was one of those two pictures.  

 One of those two pictures was Mr. McVeigh.  And two other 

 witnesses were unable to identify Mr. McVeigh from the line-up 

 at that time.  

    Now, one of the witnesses later informed the FBI agent 

 that he did not want to identify Mr. McVeigh because 

 Mr. McVeigh was looking right at him, but that was the 

 individual. 

 Q.   The business on either Harvey or Hudson that you say the 

 occupants, that they saw two people in the Ryder Truck and they 

 asked for directions, who was the person who did the talking 

 and asking for the directions according to the witness?

 A.   Mr. McVeigh, the driver of the vehicle.

 Q.   Anything else that Mr. McVeigh has alleged to have asked 

 this witness at the business on Harvey or Hudson?

 A.   To my recollection, or what I was told by the agents was 

 that it was for directions to Fifth and Harvey.  There may have 

 been something else asked, but I don't recall at this time.

 Q.   The next one, the next witness that you say who saw the 

 person that closely resembles the person in the composite 

 drawing?

 A.   On the day of the bombing? 

 Q.   Well, was this on the day of the bombing or some other 

 day?

 A.   No, these ones that we have been talking about, the last 

 several were on the day of the bombing.  There are other 

 witnesses that have identified Mr. McVeigh on the day before 

 the bombing. 

 Q.   Where was he on the day before the bombing?

         MR. GARLAND:  Objection, this is wholly outside the 

 scope of probable cause.

         THE COURT:  Sustained.

         MR. COYLE:  I will withdraw that. 

 Q.   (By Mr. Coyle)  So the female that you say, that you told 

 me about before that saw him at 8:40, that was on the day of 

 the bombing.  These are all the day of the bombing.  

    The guy who saw him on Harvey at the business that you say 

 talked to him?

 A.   The day of the bombing, shortly before the bombing.

 Q.   Approximately what time, can you tell me?  

 A.   Between 8:30 and 9.

 Q.   In your review of the surveillance photos, did you find 

 any surveillance photos of that parking lot across the street 

 from the Murrah Building?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Okay. 

 A.   You characterized that as my review of the photographs.  I 

 was shown those particular photographs by Agent Lamar. 

 Q.   Have you been shown a photograph of that particular 

 parking lot, sir, across the street from the Murrah Building 

 that includes the speeding Mercury in the photograph?

 A.   We don't know for sure yet.  Those photographs are not 

 real clear.  They are taken from a pretty good distance away.  

 There appears to be a light-colored car in the very vicinity 

 where this witness testifies -- or provides the information was 

 speeding away from.  We are not able to determine yet if that 

 is in fact the yellow Mercury.

 Q.   Can you clearly tell in the photographs that you have seen 

 or have you been advised that you can clearly tell in the film 

 the time of the explosion? 

 A.   I'm not sure I understand your question.

 Q.   Well, I don't know how to -- can you tell in the film or 

 the photographs when the explosion occurs?

 A.   The film that I viewed was before the explosion.  I did 

 not view the entire film.  The pictures that were shown to me 

 were before the explosion.

 Q.   The pictures that you saw of that particular parking 

 lot -- now I'm talking about the parking lot across the street 

 from the Murrah Building -- 

 A.   Right.

 Q.   -- in a northerly direction, that parking lot, there is 

 film of that parking lot prior to the time of the explosion?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Correct?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Is it time-stamped so that you can tell a particular time 

 of day on the 19th of April that that camera is viewing, 

 scanning that parking lot?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Can you tell me where that particular camera was located?

 A.   I believe that particular camera was located on the 

 apartment building there that we have been speaking of.

 Q.   So those were some more pictures from the Regency?

 A.   Yes, those are the pictures from the Regency.

 Q.   So the camera from the Regency -- is this the camera at 

 the very top of the Regency Tower? 

 A.   I don't know the exact location of the camera, but it kind 

 of scans that whole area there, is what has been represented to 

 me.  It scans in front of the Tower building and also over 

 towards the parking lot. 

 Q.   Any other witnesses who saw Mr. McVeigh, or someone 

 resembling him or resembling the composite photograph on April 

 19th at or about the location of the Murrah Building?

 A.   There were other witnesses that were being talked to 

 yesterday that we had just learned the identity of that advised 

 that they had seen an individual that they believed resembled 

 the composite.  Those individuals -- arrangements were being 

 made to talk to them as well, but I'm not aware of the results 

 of those interviews. 

 Q.   Well, if they saw them yesterday, they have seen a lot 

 more than the composite, haven't they?

 A.   I haven't spoken with those individuals.  I don't believe 

 they have been interviewed by any agents, so I can't really 

 address that; what they have seen and what they haven't.

Q.  So you don't know that they have seen the picture of Mr.

McVeigh on every cover of every newspaper, magazine, and

television set in America, do you?

A.  I don't know what they have seen.

Q.  Is that something that the FBI has been very careful in

asking them going over with them?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And you have discussed that with the agents and the

importance an significance of the suggestiveness of the fact

that his picture has been broadcast like that throughout our

land; have you not?

A.  I have not been the one to discuss that, but I know that is

being discussed.  I have spoken with a couple of the other

agents about that, but another agent has been assigned to

oversee that portion of the investigation.

Q.  Who is that agent?

A.  It would fall under the purview Rich Baker.

Q.  Who are the two agents you discussed it with?

A.  Two agents that are in here on a temporarily basis from San

Antonio assisting us in the investigation, John Oza, and the

second agent's name is Mike. I don't recall his last name at

the current time.

Q.  Now, other witnesses, sir, that you may have seen I am

sorry that you may have interviewed or heard of interviews in

connection with this?

         MR. GARLAND:  Objection, Your Honor that is a

complete fishing expedition and has nothing to do with probable

cause.

         MR. COYLE:  Well, that was a bad question.  I was

looking over and wanting a drink of water and asking a

question.

         THE COURT:  Objection sustained and Counsel will

rephrase the question.

         MR. COYLE:  I will get a drink and I phrase.

BY MR. COYLE:

Q.  This would be number five.  The witnesses you have told us

about that identified a person closely resembled the composite

or that was at or about a Ryder Truck or at or about the A.P.

Murrah Building that saw Mr. McVeigh or someone who resembled

him  April 19, 1995 prior to the hour of 9:03 a.m-- any other

persons fit that description that you previously described to

me in these proceedings?

A.  Not that I recall now.

Q.  Now, the persons who viewed Mr. McVeigh in the lineup, the

first one was a young black man.  Can you tell me who did not

fit Mr. McVeigh is that the man that you now recanted that

previously unidentification and has now told the agents that he

in fact did identify him?

A.  I am not aware of each person who participated each witness

that participated in the line up by name.  I am aware.

Q.  I didn't ask his name?

A.  You recall asking about a particular witness in what he

identified and what he didn't identify and I am not able to

tell which witness you are referring to by your description of

him.  I am not aware of the names of those witnesses and exact

with what each one of them had seen.  I am aware of what the

overall results were of the four witnesses.

Q.  But of the particular witnesses in the lineup, you have not

been given information as to what those witnesses said they saw

or where they saw the person accused in this case?

A.  Yes, I have been given that information along with numerous

other reports as part of the continuing investigation and --

Q.  Okay, but particularly important to you is the agent in

charge of the investigation of Mr. McVeigh are persons who

identify him, that's particularly important, isn't it?

A.  It will be, yes.

Q.  So tell us of the persons in the line up, can you tell us

anything about where they saw him reportedly?

A.  Yes, at the federal building.

Q.  All right, can you tell me what any of the male witnesses

said where they saw him?

A.  At the federal building.

Q.  When?

A.  Yes, on those dates leading up to the 19th, 17th and 18th

of April, I believe.

Q.  Are you familiar with a business by the name of Johnnie's?

A.  There's a hamburger store, I guess they are called

Johnnie's.

Q.  You are not familiar with any Johnnie's that has any

connection to this case?

A.  No.

Q.  Are you aware of what -- let me ask it this way.  Are you

aware of what the four witnesses who reviewed Mr. McVeigh in

the lineup what the substance is of what they saw or told you

they saw that has connection with this case?

A.  As I mentioned I did not interview any of these people

myself so they did not tell me anything directly.

Q.  I think you told us you haven't interviewed any of the

people I have asked you about so far, correct?

A.  That is correct.

Q.  Okay.

A.  They saw Mr. McVeigh, an individual resembling composite

one at the federal building on particular days.

Q.  They all saw him at the same time?

A.  No.

Q.  Can you tell me what one of the witnesses saw in

particular?

A.  Of those four witnesses that you are talking about that

were shown, the lineup party in the lineup, the information

that I have is that they saw Mr. McVeigh or an individual

resembling the composite at the federal building on the 17th

and 18th of April.

Q.  Okay, so the four witnesses who saw Mr. McVeigh at the --

so the lineup that was conducted, none of those four witnesses

saw Mr. McVeigh at or about the location of the Murrah Building

on the date of April 19, 1995?

A.  They may have, Mr. Coyle.  I am not familiar with what each

one of them saw and the particular date that they saw it on.  I

am aware of the witnesses that I have testified about about

when they saw the individual resembling the composite and/or

Mr. McVeigh shortly before the bombing occurred on April 19th.

Q.  Maybe I have got myself to a semantical trap here and I

want to make sure I ask this question artfully, and we have

established a number of witnesses who you say saw someone at

various locations about Oklahoma City in or about the Ryder

Truck and so forth.  Some of those witnesses that you have

described to me earlier also and in the lineup; is that

correct, sir?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Or also viewed the lineup.  I am sorry.  They didn't appear

in it.

A.  Yes.

Q.  And particularly that's one lady that you told me was

number one and we talked about as number one, she saw the

composite and she saw him at the federal building about a week

before was your testimony; do you remember that one?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And is that a black lady to your knowledge.

         MR. GARLAND:  Objection, Your Honor, we are talking

about a witness who saw a witness before the date of the

bombing and indication of the color of the witness is not

relevant or even of the witness's identification relevant to

probable cause.

         THE COURT:  This is a person observed before.

         MR. COYLE:  One he testified to at the time of the

lineup.  What I am trying to do -- I will strike that question.

That's am good objection.  I will go on.

         THE COURT:  Question is sustained.

BY MR. COYLE:

Q.  She was at the lineup.  The next one you told me about a

male saw him at the scene you say shortly before and saw the

yellow Mercury speeding away. Did that man view the lineup?

A.  No.

Q.  You told me about a female that observed a Ryder south on

Robinson, this young lady I believe was the meter maid, and she

viewed the lineup?

A.  Not as of yesterday.

Q.  Well, it happened on Saturday night, so if she didn't see

it on Saturday night, she can't see it at any other time unless

there is another lineup; am I correct?

A.  Yeah, the lineup.

Q.  Yeah.

A.  The witnesses that you are referring to did not participate

in the lineup.  The witnesses that you are referring to now are

not the ones that participated in the lineup.  You are getting

those confused with the witnesses that did.

Q.  If I ask you if they were in a lineup, what does that mean

to you?

A.  You have been referring to a particular lineup.

Q.  What does a lineup mean to you?

         THE COURT:  Counsel, let the witness answer the

question.  Please, go ahead.

BY MR. COYLE:

A.  A line up to me means when you have if actual person

present, you don't have pictures.  I referred to it if you have

pictures as a photo spread.

Q.  Okay, well, that's been my questions to you.  Were you

confused by that?  What the difference between a lineup and a

photo spread?

A.  No, I think you have been confused about it,  though.

Q.  I think so.  That we can draw a distinction here.  I am

talking about the line up.

A.  All right.

Q.  Okay, did any of the agents of the FBI tell you anything

about -- I am talking about those eight people standing there,

right?  You know what I am talking about?

A.  The lineup.

Q.  The eight people.  Did any agents of the FBI tell you

anything that those witnesses saw.  Did they make you aware of

what they say they saw at or about the Murrah Building or about

Tim McVeigh or anything about this case?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay, can you tell us what that is, please, as

 to each witness individually?

A.  One of the witnesses was able to positively identify Mr.

McVeigh.

Q.  From where?

A.  From being at the Murrah Building, at the federal building.

Q.  When?

A.  I don't know the exact date.  I believe that was on the

13th and then possibly again on 17th and the 18th of April.

Q.  Oh, saw him there on several different occasions?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And that's the female witness; is that correct?

         MR. GARLAND:  Objection, it's now been clear that

witness saw him before the bombing and therefore it's

irrelevant to this hearing.

         THE COURT:  Is that correct?

         MR. COYLE:  I don't know, she may have seen him at

other times I think it's very important as to the credibility

as to all these.  They didn't pick him out of the lineup.  That

he seems to me important.

         THE COURT:  Objection sustained.

BY MR. COYLE:

Q.  As to number two, as to the other witness?

A.  There was another witness that  picked out two individuals

and said that Mr. McVeigh, the individual that they saw most

closely resembled those two individuals and Mr. McVeigh was one

of those two individuals.

Q.  Do you know where that individual said they saw the person

that resembled Mr. McVeigh?

A.  I believe at the federal building also.

Q.  Do you know when?

A.  I am not sure of the date.

Q.  Do you know when?

A.  No, I am not sure.

Q.  They didn't tell you.  The agents didn't tell you when they

said they may have seen or this witness may have seen Mr.

McVeigh?

A.  No.

Q.  And number three?

A.  It was either on the 19TH or the days leading up to that.

I mean we are talking about that time period in there.  We are

not talking about a lot of time before that.  So it's in that

time period.  I do know that.  I don't know the exact dates,

though.

Q.  Well, some of them you told me about you knew they were on

the date of the 19th and that's particularly critical those

hours before nine o'clock on the 19th; you will agree with me

on that, won't you?

A.  Yes, we are not talking about individuals who have

participated in a lineup.

Q.  Okay, number 3 in the lineup, four people.  We have covered

two?

A.  There was another individual that I was told that was not

able to or did not pick Mr. McVeigh out of the lineup, but

later told the agent that he did recognize Mr. McVeigh, but did

not want to identify him because Mr. McVeigh was looking right

at him.

Q.  And that individual, where did he see Mr. McVeigh?

A.  Again, I believe that all of these witnesses, the four that

participated in the lineup observed Mr. McVeigh either at or in

the federal building.

Q.  When?

A.  I am not sure.

Q.  When on number three?  The one that say changed his

observations after the lineup?

A.  I don't know the exact date.

Q.  Do you know the time?

A.  No, I don't.

Q.  Do you know where this particular person was at the time

that he later told the agent that he saw the accused?

A.  I believe it was shortly after the lineup had occurred.

Q.  Now, this particular witness, do you know where he was at

the Murrah Building, where the witness was at the Murrah

Building on whatever day you don't know that he says that he

possibly saw Timothy McVeigh?

A.  Well, no, I don't know.

Q.  That wasn't important to you?

A.  It's important to me.  It's very important in time.  It's

not absolutely necessary for this hearing.  There are other

things.

Q.  I don't think that is up to you.  Isn't that up to the

Judge, Agent?

A.  What's important in the hearing.

Q.  Isn't that up to the, Judge?

A.  Did you not ask me the question?

         THE COURT:  Ask the question.

BY MR. COYLE:

Q.  I asked you a simple question; don't you know?

         THE COURT:  Mr. Coyle, don't argue with the witness.

Ask the question.

BY MR. COYLE:

Q.  Don't you know where this witness was?  Someone who claims

he looks at Mr. McVeigh in a lineup and doesn't pick him out

and tells an agent later that he saw him, and you are telling

us here in Court that you don't know where this witness saw

him?

A.  That is correct.

Q.  All right.  The next one in the lineup?

A.  The last one in the lineup did not pick out Mr. McVeigh.

They advised that they had seen an individual resembling

composite one at the federal building.

Q.  Is that the Murrah Federal Building?

A.  Yes.

Q.  On the 19th?

A.  I don't know the date, and the date either on the 19th or

the days leading up to that date.

Q.  Well, I thought Mr. McVeigh was at the Dreamland Motel?

A.  He was.

Q.  In Kansas?

A.  He was.

Q.  Okay.

A.  On some of those days and some of those times.

Q.  Have the agents of the FBI asked these witnesses at the

Dreamland Motel, have they told them about the testimony of the

people or the statements that the people made to the FBI that

he was in Oklahoma City when other witnesses say he was

somewhere in Kansas and Michigan, and other places across the

country?

         MR. GARLAND:  Objection, there has been no testimony

to that fact.

         THE COURT:  Sustained as to the phrase.  Rephrase the

question.

BY MR. COYLE:

Q.  The last person in the line up, did that person -- do you

know where that person was at or about the federal building at

the time they purportedly saw Mr. McVeigh in some time the days

leading up to explosion?

A.  No, I do not.

Q.  Did you ask?

A.  No, I not.

Q.  Okay, now, it talks about employees of the Dreamland Motel

in Junction City, Kansas.  I am on paragraph 8, now of the

affidavit.  You've reviewed Agent Gibbons' affidavit of

probable cause; have you not?

A.  Yes.

Q.  It says employees of the Dreamland Motel in Junction City,

Kansas advised FBI agents that an individual resembling

composite number one ,that is, Government No. 2 there, had been

a guest at the motel from April 14th through 18th.  Do you know

how many employees were interviewed?

A.  At least three.

Q.  Do you know the outcome of those interviews?

A.  No, the outcome of one interview in particular where the

manager of the Dreamland Motel was interviewed.

Q.  Has the manager been shown the composite the photo spread

or was she at the lineup?

A.  The manager has been shown the photo spread.

Q.  Was the manager shown the photo spread prior to the time

that the affidavit was prepared in this case?

A.  No.

Q.  But since that time the manager has been shown the photo

spread?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Did she identify Timothy McVeigh as being a guest in that

motel on the dates April 14th through 18th?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Have handwriting comparisons been performed on any

documents that he's signed?

A.  I don't believe yet.  That's still on-going.

Q.  Has an analysis been prepared to your knowledge on any

other forensic evidence at the motel?

A.  No, I don't believe so.  That is still part of the on-going

investigation.

Q.  Well, you mean you haven't been to the motel and gathered

it or you are going to gather it and you are going to look at

something?

A.  It has been gathered from the motel and been sent back to

the FBI Laboratory in Washington, D.C.

Q.  Can you tell me what was gathered at the motel?

         MR. GARLAND:  Objection, Your Honor, once again this

is discovery.  It is unrelated to the probable cause hearing.

         THE COURT:  How does this relate to probable cause?

         MR. COYLE: Sir?

         THE COURT:  How does this relate?

         MR. COYLE:  It goes to whether he was at the Dreamland

Motel in Junction City, Kansas, what the evidence they have to

substantiate that.  What I have had -- what I asked him is what

evidence has been sent to the lab for comparison.  That's all I

need to know in that regard.

         THE COURT:  Objection will be overruled go ahead and

answer.

BY MR. COYLE:

A.  That investigation is being conducted in Junction City,

Kansas and the evidence I believe is being sent or has been

sent direct to the FBI Laboratory in Washington, D.C., and I am

not aware of the contents of all the information or items that

may have been taken from that location.

Q.  Do they tell you, any of them, what they might have taken

or anything they found that they wanted tested?

A.  I know that the registration card in Tim McVeigh's name was

at that location.  They obtained that and that has also been

forwarded.

Q.  Anything else that you know of?

A.  No, I don't know the contents of what was sent back.

Q.  Let me ask you about the Elliott's Body Shop in Junction

City, Kansas.  Are you familiar, sir, with any of the

interviews that have been conducted with anyone employed at the

Elliott's Body Shop?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  Was it a male or female?

A.  There has been --

         MR. GARLAND:  Your Honor, I object to the sex of the

people.  It is not relevant to probable cause.

         THE COURT:  Overruled.

BY MR. COYLE:

A.  There was one female and two males interviewed that I know

of at that location.

Q.  Did the female identify Timothy McVeigh?

A.  The female advised that participated in the composite that

was drawn of the individual that rented the Ryder Truck on

April 17th.

Q.  I think my question to you was did the female witness

identify Timothy McVeigh?

A.  The female witness was not shown a photo spread nor did she

participate in a lineup.  She did advise that the composite

that was drawn up closely resembles the individual that rented

the truck.

Q.  Have you been made aware, sir, that whether or not she has

called agents of the FBI or just the local police or anybody

and said I have seen his picture in the paper or on television

or somewhere and that's him.  That's the guy that rented the

truck too.  Have you heard any such statements?

A.  No, I have not.

Q.  Has anyone from the FBI talked to anyone that saw the

person who rented the truck to your knowledge?

A.  I don't know, not to my knowledge.

Q.  You are the guy that would know.  You are working on the

investigation of Timothy McVeigh.

         MR. GARLAND:  Objection, Your Honor is that a

statement or question?

         THE COURT:  That will be stricken from the record go

ahead.

BY MR. COYLE:

Q.  Has the witness there at the Ryder Truck rental there in

Kansas specifically the Elliott's Body Shop in Junction City,

Kansas -- did they see Mr. Timothy McVeigh or someone that

resembled the composite?

A.  Yes.

Q.  The first male, did they see the composite or did they

assist in its preparation?

A.  Both.

Q.  What was that particular persons involvement with Mr. -- or

with the person in the composite in the rental of the truck?

A.  When the person that rented the truck was in the Elliott's

Body Shop on the 17th, this person was also in the body shop

and in a position to observe that individual that was renting

the truck.

Q.  So this is not an employee of the body shop, but it's

another patron or someone who was in there visiting?

A.  This is another employee of the shop.

Q.  Okay, and was in a position to look at the man that rented

the truck?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And was this male involved in the rental of the truck,

involved in the specific conversations with a person who rented

the truck?

A.  No.

Q.  Did this person overhear conversations to your knowledge

with the person that rented the truck?

A.  Yes, I believe so.

Q.  Was the truck rented by a male or a female?

A.  By a male.

Q.  Is that the male that you are telling me about now?

A.  Yes, that he used the name Bob Kling.

Q.  Okay, that was a bad question, thank you.  Was the person

who was employed by Elliott's Body Shop in Junction City,

Kansas that rented the truck to the person who  -- who is shown

in the composite as Government Exhibit No. 2 was that person

the employee of the body shop a male or a female?

A.  A male.

Q.  And that person, one who did the renting, is that the male

that you have been telling me about -- you've just told me?

A.  I am not sure of the question that you said I have been

telling you about.

Q.  Okay, let me make it clear.  You told me there were three

people there at the body shop in Junction City, Kansas, right?

A.  Three employees.

Q.  Three employees.  We have been over one, that female.  Did

the female employee of Elliott's Body Shop in Junction City,

Kansas rent the truck to the person in Government Exhibit No.

2?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  Was that the person who filled out the paperwork?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Was that the female employee?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And the next male you told me about then you told me about

a male who overheard some conversation, do you know what

conversation that male overheard?

A.  Overheard the conversations as the rental was taking place

that person was seated in that same area where the actual

rental was taking place.

Q.  What did that agent tell agents of the FBI that he

overheard?

A.  I am not aware of what he said he overheard.  I am aware

that he said he was able to see the individual and that the

individual was the -- that the composite that was drawn was a

fair and representative likeness of that individual.

Q.  Do you know what the individual who -- who supposedly

rented the truck, the one in the composite, do you know what he

was wearing -- what he was said to have been wearing that day?

A.  No, I do not.

Q.  Okay, do you know what the female said that the person who

rented the truck, not the one employed there, the one in the

composite was wearing on that date?  Now, the third witness

that you have described for us, the male there at Elliott's

Body Shop, employee in Junction City, Kansas, did this person

participate in the preparation of the composite?

A.  Yes, to some extent?

Q.  Now, how did this -- were you there when they did the

composite?

A.  No.

Q.  What was this person's participation in the composite?

A.  To provide description of information regarding individual

that he had observed renting the Ryder Truck and the two

provided information that the composite fairly represented the

individual that rented the truck.

Q.  Can you tell me what his involvement was in the rental of

the truck?

A.  I believe he was just there.  He is the owner of the

business, I believe.

Q.  Do you know where he was in location to the person in the

composite at the time of the rental of the truck?

A.  Not exactly, but I believe he was in close vicinity.  I

know that this individual asked to use the phone in there.

This male that we are talking about now is the one that said

that he could.

Q.  Okay, has this man been shown a photo line up?

A.  No.

Q.  I mean a photo spread.  Has this man viewed Mr. McVeigh in

a lineup?

A.  No.

Q.  Has he called anybody anyone of the males, the owner or the

other fellow there that was employed, has either one of those

called the FBI and said we have seen this man on television, we

have seen him in any of a thousand newspapers across the

country and that's the man we have rented the truck to?

A.  No, not to my knowledge.

Q.  Don't you think you would know that?

A.  I don't know.  There are also others conducting

investigation very rapidly.  If that had happened several days

ago, the answer would be likely yes.  If it happened within the

last day or two, I don't know.

Q.  You really don't think they would let you know?

A.  I think they will let me know.  They will eventually let me

know

         MR. COYLE:  Judge, could we take a short break?

         THE COURT:  How many longer do you anticipate?

         MR. COYLE:  I don't think too much longer.  I will

gather my thoughts and try to conclude.

         THE COURT:  We will take a recess at this time and the

marshals may remove the Defendant.

    (AFTER THE RECESS, THE FOLLOWING PROCEEDINGS WERE HELD IN

OPEN COURT:)

         THE COURT:  Let the record show that counsel are

present and the Defendant is present.  We are on

cross-examination.  You may proceed.

 Q.   It says, Agent Hersley, in the Affidavit prepared by Agent 

 Gibbons in connection with this case that on April 20th, the 

 rental agent was recontacted and assisted in the creation of 

 composite drawings.  It says "the rental agent."  Does that 

 mean all of the agents, all of the rental agents, all three of 

 the people you told us about?

 A.   My understanding is the individual that was in a position 

 to watch the individual that was renting the truck on that day 

 assisted primarily in compiling the composite.  And the other 

 individuals, the other two employees, also assisted to some 

 extent.

 Q.   It says in the paragraph of the Affidavit by Agent Gibbons 

 that a fair and accurate depiction of the individuals who 

 rented the truck; is that correct?

 A.   There were two composites drawn, one of each individual 

 that was in there that day.

 Q.   The other composite, did he do the renting of the truck?

 A.   No.

 Q.   So the person -- you have been advised that the person who 

 is identified in Government's Exhibit 2 is the person who gave 

 the identification and rented the truck?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   What is your understanding of what the other individual 

 did during the time that the individual in Government's Exhibit 

 2 was renting the truck?

 A.   I believe he is the one that brought the individual 

 pictured in composite one to the rental location and was there 

 while the individual pictured in composite one was getting the 

 paperwork completed and actually renting the truck.

 Q.   Have you been made aware of what he was doing at the time 

 that he rented the truck?

 A.   I believe he was just standing in the office there.

 Q.   Was he standing close and assisting in the rental?  Did he 

 give money, did he do anything active that you have been 

 advised during that time?

 A.   I don't believe so, no.

 Q.   Now, you have testified here in court earlier about some 

 calls made from Room 25.  Is Room 25 the one that was rented by 

 the person that has been identified in composite one?

 A.   Room 25 was rented by Mr. McVeigh.

 Q.   It was rented by a Mr. Tim McVeigh, correct?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   At the Dreamland Motel?

 A.   That's correct.

 Q.   You said that certain calls were made from that room?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   You said something about a call to a restaurant or can you 

 explain that to me?  I didn't understand that. 

 A.   Yes, there was a call from Room 25 to a local restaurant 

 in Junction City.  The caller placed an order for food to go 

 and gave the Room 25 and the phone number at the Dreamland 

 Hotel and used the name Kling. 

 Q.   Was that an order to go or a delivery?

 A.   Delivery order, excuse me.

 Q.   Delivery order?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   In other words, he called the place.  Was it a pizza 

 restaurant?

 A.   No, it was a Chinese food restaurant.

 Q.   Was the Chinese food then delivered to Room 25 of the 

 Dreamland Motel?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   That was on April 15, which would have been Saturday, I 

 believe, right?

 A.   That's correct.

 Q.   Was that food delivered?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   I believe you told us that that person -- I believe you 

 told us on direct, these are some of my notes, I'm not sure if 

 I asked you this -- after being shown a photo spread that 

 contained the accused in this case, the young man who brought 

 the Chinese food was unable to identify the accused?

 A.   That's correct.

 Q.   Any other telephone calls that were made from this room 

 that there is a record of?

  MR. GARLAND:  Objection, Your Honor.  This is again 

 purely discovery and unrelated to probable cause.

         THE COURT:  Overruled. 

 Q.   Any other telephone calls?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Okay.  Can you tell me where those were made to, sir?

 A.   Yes, they were made to Terry Nichols.

 Q.   Where was Terry Nichols at the time the calls were made?  

 Where were the calls made to, someplace in Michigan?

         MR. GARLAND:  Your Honor -- 

         MR. COYLE:  I'm sorry, I interrupted you. 

         MR. GARLAND:  I'm sorry.  Well, we are both sorry.  

         The location to which the calls were made is again 

 unrelated to probable cause.  The discovery of this would 

 interfere with the rest of the investigation.

         THE COURT:  As to the location, the objection is 

 sustained.

 Q.   (By Mr. Coyle)  Terry Nichols, anyone else, sir?

 A.   Those are the ones that I recall.

 Q.   Were the calls to Terry Nichols?

 A.   To Terry Nichols' residence in Herington.

 Q.   Any other calls that you recall that were made from Room 

 25 at the Dreamland Motel from the dates of April 14th through 

 18th, '95?

 A.   Not that I recall now.  Those are the ones that I recall.

 Q.   Were the calls charged to the room?

         MR. GARLAND:  Objection, Your Honor.  Once again 

 whoever it was charged to is not relevant to probable cause.  

 These are leads being pursued in an ongoing investigation.

         MR. COYLE:  There is no way that us knowing whether 

 they were charged to the room or not is going to jeopardize any 

 ongoing investigation.

         THE COURT:  Overruled.

 Q.   (By Mr. Coyle)  Were they charged to the room or were they 

 put on a telephone credit card or how were those billed, Agent 

 Hersley?

 A.   The call to the Chinese food restaurant was a local call.  

 The other calls were the -- to a credit card, debit card.

 Q.   Who --

 A.   Through the debit card.  A credit card, debit card was 

 used to make those calls.

 Q.   It was a debit card?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   As opposed to a credit card?

 A.   I believe so, yes.

 Q.   You understand the distinction of what we are talking 

 about?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Do you know whose debit card it was?  Have you been 

 advised?

 A.   It is in the name of Bridges, I believe. 

 Q.   Have you found the person Bridges who is the owner of the 

 debit card?

         MR. GARLAND:  Objection, Your Honor.

         THE COURT:  Sustained. 

 Q.   Now is there a list of all calls made, whether or not they 

 were local calls there in the Ft. Riley-Junction City area or 

 they were long distance calls?  Do you have a record of all of 

 those calls?

 A.   From the Dreamland Hotel? 

 Q.   Yes? 

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Is there a call among those to Elliott's Body Shop in 

 Junction City?

 A.   No.

 Q.   How many employees of the Dreamland Motel in Junction 

 City, Kansas have been interviewed that you are aware of?

 A.   Three.

 Q.   Are they all males or all females?

 A.   I'm aware of the identity of the manager, who is a 

 female.  I believe that at least one of the other individuals 

 that was interviewed is also female.  I'm not aware of the 

 identity of the third person.

 Q.   Has the manager female identified Mr. McVeigh?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Has she identified Mr. McVeigh from what you say is the 

 composite or a photo spread or a live line-up or just from TV 

 and newspapers and radio?

 A.   She positively identified Mr. McVeigh through the photo 

 spread.

 Q.   When was she shown that photo spread?

 A.   Within the last two days.

 Q.   After the time that his picture has been broadcast all 

 over America?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   The other female there at the Dreamland Motel, how did she 

 identify Mr. McVeigh, if she did?

 A.   From the composite.

 Q.   Has she been shown a photo spread?

 A.   No.

 Q.   When was she shown the composite?

 A.   Several days ago.  She was shown the composite and she 

 identified the composite as very strongly resembling the 

 individual that was staying in Room 25, Mr. McVeigh.

 Q.   Do all of these people use the word "very strongly 

 resembling" or do they use other words to describe that, don't 

 they?

 A.   The employees at the Dreamland, that is the way they 

 described it. 

 Q.   So the composite to the second female employee was shown 

 after the photos were available several days ago?

 A.   There is not a second composite of a female employee.

 Q.   I'm sorry, okay.  The second employee, was that a female 

 or a male?

 A.   Female.

 Q.   The first one we talked about is the manager.  She was 

 shown the photo spread after Mr. McVeigh's photograph has been 

 published around the world, correct?

 A.   Correct.

 Q.   Then there is a second employee there, male or female?

 A.   Female.

 Q.   Now the female employee, not the manager, what sort of 

 composite photo spread or line-up of what has she been shown?

 A.   The composite.

 Q.   Only the composite?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   That was several days ago?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Can you tell me the reason or the strategy behind not 

 showing her the photo spread?

         MR. GARLAND:  Objection to the characterization.

         THE COURT:  Sustained. 

 Q.   Do you know why she was not shown the photo spread? 

 Because it was available at that time, am I correct?

 A.   No, I do not know.

 Q.   The manager, is she the one that rented the room to the 

 person who identified himself as Tim McVeigh and checked in as 

 Tim McVeigh; is that correct?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Is she the person who is alleged to have rented the room?

 A.   Yes, she rented the room to Mr. McVeigh.

 Q.   To a Mr. Tim McVeigh, correct?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   The other female employee, can you tell me her 

 involvement?

 A.   "Her involvement," I'm not sure what you mean by your 

 question.

 Q.   Well, okay.  The second female employee, who is not the 

 manager of the Dreamland Motel, what has she told or in what 

 manner has she observed the person she identified from a 

 composite as number one in Government's Exhibit 2 in these 

 proceedings, what she saw him do during the time that he was a 

 guest of that motel?

 A.   She just saw him at the hotel.  On one particular occasion 

 she was going to go into the room, thinking that Mr. McVeigh 

 had left the hotel.  When she started to open the door, 

 Mr. McVeigh did so and she observed him on that occasion.

 Q.   He opened the door for her --

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   -- as she came to the door.  Did she knock on the door?

 A.   I don't know.  I believe she thought he was gone.  She was 

 going to clean the room.  She was a maid.

 Q.   Now, was there -- did she see him on any other occasions 

 that you are aware of?

 A.   I'm not aware of how many occasions that she actually 

 observed him at the hotel.

 Q.   You told us, I believe earlier, that there were three and 

 there is also a male?

 A.   No, I didn't say -- I said that I didn't know the identity 

 of the third one.

 Q.   You don't know the sex or the identity of the third one,  

 but that's another witness from the Dreamland, am I correct?

 A.   Right.

 Q.   Is that an employee of the Dreamland?

 A.   I believe so, yes.

 Q.   Tell me, please, sir, how that person at the Dreamland, 

 who was employed by the Dreamland, observed the person who 

 identified himself as Tim McVeigh?

 A.   This person, to my knowledge, observed the individual who 

 identified himself as Mr. McVeigh at the Dreamland Hotel.  I 

 don't know whether that was in the office or whether that was 

 out in the area where the rooms are.

 Q.   Now, you told us that persons -- a person at the Dreamland 

 Motel saw Mr. McVeigh, or saw someone who resembled the 

 photograph -- or I'm sorry, the composite, which is 

 Government's Exhibit 2 in this case, arrive at Dreamland in a 

 Ryder Truck?

 A.   No.  My testimony was that that person observed 

 Mr. McVeigh arrive at the motel in the truck.  That person has 

 positively identified Mr. McVeigh from the photo spread.

 Q.   From the photo spread.  

    Is that one of these employees?

 A.   That's the person that rented the room to Mr. McVeigh.

 Q.   Who is the female manager, am I correct, sir?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   When did she allegedly see Mr. McVeigh arrive at the 

 Dreamland Motel in a Ryder Truck?

 A.   On April 17th of this year.

 Q.   What time?

 A.   Sometime in the afternoon to early evening hours.  Late 

 afternoon to early evening.

 Q.   Was there anyone else in the truck with him --

 A.   No.

 Q.   -- at the time she saw him?

 A.   No.

 Q.   Now, you say that someone also saw Mr. McVeigh at 4 a.m. 

 in a Ryder Truck, correct?

 A.   Yes.  The manager said that she observed Mr. McVeigh in 

 the same Ryder Truck at 4 a.m. that next morning.

 Q.   You mean he was driving in it on the 18th at 4 a.m. in the 

 morning?

 A.   No, he was sitting in the truck with the light on in the 

 passenger compartment, seated in the driver's seat.  She said 

 he appeared to be studying something, possibly looking at a 

 map.

 Q.   She saw a map?

 A.   No.  She said possibly.  He was looking at something.  He 

 had the light on inside the passenger compartment inside the 

 Ryder Truck.

 Q.   How long did she see him?

 A.   She just looked out the window and noticed he was in 

 there.

 Q.   Was she sure that it was Mr. McVeigh?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Did she get the tag of that truck?

 A.   No.

 Q.   What time did the truck leave the motel?

 A.   She didn't say exactly.  She doesn't know exactly when it 

 left.  She looked out the window again around 5 o'clock and it 

 was gone.

 Q.   At 5 a.m. in the morning?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   When did Mr. McVeigh check out?

 A.   She did not see him again after that.

 Q.   Well, is that 5 a.m. on the 17th?

 A.   No, I think you are getting confused on that.  I think it 

 is -- 

 Q.   I don't know.  I didn't ask. 

 A.   My testimony was it was on the 18th.

 Q.   18th?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Okay.  We want to be accurate on these things, don't we?

         MR. GARLAND:  Objection.

         THE COURT:  Sustained.

 Q.   (By Mr. Coyle)  So is it your testimony from any the 

 employees of the Dreamland that Mr. McVeigh -- from interviews 

 of all of them, that Mr. McVeigh did not actually physically 

 check out of the Dreamland Motel?

 A.   I believe that's correct.  He paid for the room in advance 

 for four days; argued with the manager about the rate and paid 

 the entire bill up front.  He then just left sometime between 

 four and five on the morning of the 18th.

 Q.   Are you aware of any evidence of the whereabouts of the 

 Ryder Truck between that time that you told us on the 18th at 

 five o'clock in the morning, O500 -- so we won't be confused -- 

 and the time that you say persons saw it in the downtown area 

 of Oklahoma City on the 19th?

         MR. GARLAND:  Objection.  Discovery; not probable 

 cause.

         MR. COYLE:  This goes directly to everything in the 

 Affidavit between -- 

         THE COURT:  Overruled.

         MR. COYLE:  -- that time. 

 A.   No.

 Q.   You told me something about the pistol that Mr. McVeigh 

 was alleged to have had on his person at the time that he was 

 placed under arrest by a trooper of the Oklahoma Highway 

 Patrol.  You said something about a certain kind of a bullet.  

 What kind of bullet was that?

 A.   It is referred to in the law enforcement circles as a 

 cop-killer bullet. 

 Q.   Well, he didn't kill the cop that walked up to the car, 

 did he?

 A.   No.

 Q.   In fact, isn't it your information, Agent Hersley, that he 

 told the cop that walked up to the car, instead of killing him 

 with a cop-killer bullet, he said, "I have a gun?"

 A.   That was after the officer had already observed it.

 Q.   Oh.  

    So is it your testimony, then, that the highway patrolman 

 drew-down on this young man, then?  He saw the gun and 

 drew-down on him at that point?

         MR. GARLAND:  Objection.  We are talking about 

 something occurring after the bombing.

         THE COURT:  I sustain the objection.

         MR. COYLE:  We have the highway patrolman here, so 

 we'll -- I was just trying to save some time with that. 

 Q.   (By Mr. Coyle)  In fact, part of your testimony about this 

 cop-killer bullet business, is there any evidence that 

 Mr. McVeigh killed a cop on that day?  Is there any evidence of 

 that?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   That he is a cop killer?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   What is that? 

 A.   The evidence points toward the fact that he blew up 

 several Federal law enforcement officers in the Federal 

 Building that morning.

 Q.   With this Glock .45?

 A.   No, with a massive bomb.

 Q.   With these cop-killer bullets, is what I'm asking.  With 

 the cop-killer bullets?

 A.   What is your question? 

 Q.   With the cop-killer bullets?  Any evidence that he had 

 shot anybody with the cop-killer bullets?

 A.   No.

 Q.   Is there any evidence that Mr. McVeigh -- that this young 

 man had ever been arrested at anytime in his life prior to the 

 time he was arrested by the Highway Patrol in Oklahoma?

 A.   No.

 Q.   Have you heard of any statements that have been made by 

 the accused in this case to any agents in law enforcement?

 A.   No, I don't believe so.

 Q.   So he hasn't made any statements to anyone in law 

 enforcement in connection with any of the events in this case?

 A.   He provided some descriptive background to law enforcement 

 at the time he was arrested, but no further information, I 

 don't believe.

 Q.   Tell me about the descriptive background that you tell us 

 that he provided.

         MR. GARLAND:  Objection.  This is long after the 

 bombing at this point.  It has nothing to do with probable 

 cause here.

         THE COURT:  It might have something to do -- 

         MR. COYLE:  It is a statement of the accused.

         THE COURT:  Overruled. 

 A.   Just information regarding his name and date of birth and 

 physical description.

 Q.   He gave them his name?

 A.   He also, I believe, made some statements to the officer 

 that stopped him in regard to the Glock .45.

 Q.   What did he say about the Glock .45?

 A.   I believe he recited the serial number of it to the 

 officer.

 Q.   Now, the vehicle that we have heard described as the 

 yellow Mercury, are you familiar with that vehicle?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   You know which one we are talking about, the one that 

 Mr. McVeigh was allegedly in?

 A.   He was arrested in that vehicle.

 Q.   You saw him arrested in that vehicle?

 A.   No. 

 Q.   Okay.  Where was that vehicle located when the FBI secured 

 that vehicle?

 A.   Up close to Perry, Oklahoma. 

 Q.   When was it that the FBI got the vehicle?  Had it been 

 towed in and impounded?

         MR. GARLAND:  Objection, this is purely discovery.  

 It has nothing to do with probable cause.

         THE COURT:  Yes.

         MR. COYLE:  Okay. 

 Q.   That's the car that he was arrested in, am I correct?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   At the time of his arrest, do you know whether or not that 

 car was towed by the Highway Patrol to a secure location or 

 whether or not it was left on the side of the road?

         MR. GARLAND:  Objection, this is discovery.

         MR. COYLE:  That's right in the middle of the stuff 

 that he testified to when they were picked up. 

         MR. GARLAND:  He didn't testify about anything -- 

         THE COURT:  Go ahead to the next question, Counsel. 

 Q.   (By Mr. Coyle)  Agent Hersley, tell us about any evidence 

 in the possession of the FBI that Timothy McVeigh actually 

 detonated the bomb that exploded in front of the Murrah 

 Building, that he detonated the bomb?

 A.   The results of the test that came back from the FBI 

 laboratory that Mr. McVeigh's shirt had residue of PTEN on it 

 indicates that Mr. McVeigh was likely in the vicinity of the 

 Ryder Truck at the time the time fuse, or similar type object 

 to ignite the blast, was activated.

 Q.   Tell me what PETN (sic), what did you say that was?

 A.   It is an explosive that is used in -- commonly used in 

 detonating cord.

 Q.   Where was it found on his shirt?

 A.   I'm not sure of the exact area of his shirt. 

 Q.   I think you -- didn't you say that word before?  I mean, 

 it was a series.  I couldn't write that fast.  The chemical 

 name for this PTND (sic)? 

 A.   It is penta erythrite tetral nitrate.  

 Q.   When you say it is commonly found in detonating cord?

 A.   Yes.

 Q.   Have you determined other uses for it?

 A.   No, I have not.

 Q.   Have you asked?

 A.   Aside from that it is very commonly found in detonating 

 cord, I have not asked that, no.

         MR. COYLE:  May I have a moment with my colleagues? 

         THE COURT:  Yes.

    (Whereupon, an off-the-record discussion was had between 

 Defense counsel and the Defendant.  Thereafter:)

Q.  Can you tell us, Agent Hersley, if the FBI or anyone else

in law enforcement is aware of any statements of other persons

that implicate the accused Timothy McVeigh on the bombing of

the federal building?

         MR. GARLAND:  Objection, Your Honor, only after

indictment, they would be entitled to that Kind of information.

Under the James Act, they would not be entitled to such

information until the witnesses testified at trial.  This is

purely and only discovery that is barred by the Federal Rules

of Criminal Procedure.

         THE COURT:  Sustained.

BY MR. COYLE:

Q.  Who did you talk to about the PTND?

A.  Rick Hahn.

Q.  Rick Hahn was the guy on that too?

A.  Yes.

Q.  When did Rick Hahn tell you that?

A.  Within the last two to three days.  I also spoke with Jim

Norman another agent in our office about that.

Q.  What is Jim Norman's specialty?

A.  Bombing matters.

Q.  He is another one of these bomb guys?

A.  He is a bombs explosives guy.

Q.  Was he making up the test on the shirt that was allegedly

worn by Mr. McVeigh?

A.  Did Agent Norman do it.

Q.  Yes?

A.  No, that was done by our laboratory back in Washington.

         MR. COYLE:  I believe that's all.  Thank you, sir.

         THE COURT:  Anything further of this witness?

         MR. GARLAND:  No further questions.

         THE COURT:  Any other further evidence on behalf of

the United States?

         MR. GARLAND:  No.

         THE COURT:  The United States rest?

         MR. GARLAND:  Yes, Your Honor.

         THE COURT:  Any others on behalf of the Defendant?

         MR. COYLE:  May I have a moment, Judge?

         THE COURT:  Yes.

         MR. COYLE:  Your Honor, the accused would call the

trooper of the highway patrol identified as Charles Hanger.  We

would ask, I believe he is here.  He has been subpoena duces

tecum.

         MR. GARLAND:  Your Honor, the government moved to

quash that.  I would like to have a moment to argue.

         THE COURT:  Very well.

         MR. GARLAND:  The government has filed a copy of its

motion to quash with the Court and has delivered copies to the

defense attorney.  The only purpose of preliminary hearing --

         THE COURT:  Excuse me I don't believe I have your

motion.

         MR. GARLAND:  I don't have a copy.

         THE COURT:  Here is a copy.

         MR. GARLAND:  Your Honor, actually I would encourage

the Court to take another brief break in order to read the

paper.

         THE COURT:  Go ahead make your statement and I will

read as you go on.

         MR. GARLAND:   The purpose of the preliminary hearing

and only purpose under the Tenth Circuit rule under the Robbins

case is to determine probable cause.

    Discovery is emphatically not a purpose.  Other evidence

which might be relevant for suppression is not the purpose of

this hearing.  They, therefore, cannot subpoena a witness,

particularly, a government witness which is who this trooper is

unless they can show that that witness has evidence that would

negate the existence of probable cause.   You see the citation

the Second Circuit Cirtina.

    Following that citation are two district court cases, one

in Tennessee and one in Eastern District of Pennsylvania

affirmed by the Third Circuit which rejected attempts by

Defendant to call a government witness in its case in chief in

a preliminary examination.

    Even in the most liberal of all circuits which happens to

be the circuit from which I come, the D.C, that Court has held

unless the Defendant is able to make a plausible showing that

the witness would contribute significantly to the accuracy of

the probable cause determination, they may not call him.

    This witness did not see the bombing.  He did not see

anything other than the arrest.  He cannot contribute to the

question of probable cause in a way that would assist the

Defendant.  For that reason, only purpose for bringing him here

is to obtain discovery of that witness and we urge that he not

be permitted to testify at this hearing.

         THE COURT:  Defendant?

         MS. OTTO:  Your Honor, if I may, I believe

         THE COURT:  If you would like to stand there, that's

fine.

         MS. OTTO:  I believe I was the attorney who prepared

the subpoena application request and submitted it to the Court

so most proper for me to respond to this.

    As the Court is aware, Rule 5.1 of the Federal Rules Of

Criminal Procedure 5.1A expressly provides the Defendant may

cross-examine adverse witnesses and may introduce evidence.

Under the subpoena power of the Court, that is defined in rule

17, Mr. McVeigh as an indigent defendant may ask the Court to

cause a subpoena to be issued for a witness.  That is exactly

what we have done.

    The fact that the government wants to characterize a

particular person as a quote unquote government witness, does

not place him outside the purview of the Court's subpoena

power.

    As I understand the government's contention during this

preliminary hearing, they are alleging that Mr. McVeigh

detonated a bomb that exploded in front of the A.P. Murrah

Building approximately 9:03 in the morning.  I think the

circumstances surrounding the arrest of Mr. McVeigh on

Interstate 35 just outside Perry, Oklahoma is highly relevant

to the issue of probable cause.

    Mr. McVeigh's demeanor at the time, the government has

introduced evidence attempting to establish that Mr. McVeigh

had a loaded firearm on his person at the time of his arrest,

his interaction with the police officer, his general

presentation of himself, his reaction to the stop and the

arrest and the circumstances surrounding the arrest are highly

relevant to the issue of whether or not Mr. McVeigh was the

person who detonated the bomb.

    I have not heard any hearsay evidence or any direct

evidence from any government witness establishing that there is

proof, a witness, Mr. McVeigh detonated the bomb.  The only

thing I heard was listening fairly closely for this was a

laboratory test that indicated the presence have some substance

on his shirt and from that we are deducing that he was in

contact I guess with det cord.

    Again, we have no witnesses.  None of these various

witnesses identified and unidentified by the government have

established that they saw Mr. McVeigh detonate the bomb.

That's all there is to it.

    They allegedly  saw him in the area, and we can argue about

the eyewitness identification during allocution, but there is

no direct evidence of this.

    I think the evidence about the circumstances surrounding

the arrest is highly material.  Certainly the government in

ever case that I have ever had with them always makes a great

deal about the nervousness of a suspect who is stopped, his

general demeanor, his or her actions during the arrest, that's

always intrinsic in the government case.

    Lots of people looking guilty and get the stopped.  I think

it's very important that we hear what Trooper Hanger has to say

about this traffic stop and about Mr. McVeigh's  interaction

with him at the time.

    It is very close in time to the event in downtown Oklahoma

City.  It isn't something where he stopped three days later.

This is an hour and some minutes after the explosion in

downtown Oklahoma City.  It's part and parcel of it, relevant

to the issue of probable cause, and that's why we asked the

Court to issue the subpoena in the first place.

         THE COURT:  Would it be the Court's understanding that

the trooper's testimony would essentially follow what is stated

in paragraph 13?

         MS. OTTO:   Paragraph 13 of the affidavit?

         THE COURT:  I am sorry of the affidavit.

         MS. OTTO:  Well, that is certainly part of it.

         THE COURT:  What additional evidence?

         MS. OTTO:  The demeanor of Mr. McVeigh. Agent Hersley

testified that its his understanding that Mr. McVeigh talks

about the weapon only after the trooper sees it.  That's not in

paragraph 13.  There is some additional information that is

contained in paragraph 13 and I don't think this witness is

going to take all that long anyway.

         THE COURT:  Does the government disagree with anything

stated in paragraph 13?

         MR. GARLAND:  Your Honor, I don't think that the

demeanor of the witness is relevant to the negation of probable

cause.  That is even if a witness's demeanor were perfectly

normal in every other way it wouldn't make any difference to

the probable cause determination.

         THE COURT:  Do you disagree with Agent Hersley?

         MR. GARLAND:  With what's in 13?

         THE COURT:  Do you disagree with Agent Hersley's

testimony about the witness at the time -- the Defendant.

         MR. GARLAND:  No, I certainly do not disagree.

         THE COURT:  Do you disagree with statements made in

paragraph 13 of the affidavit and part of complaint.

         MR. GARLAND:  No, Your Honor, I do not.

         MS. OTTO:  This is the arrest that starts the whole

chain of events that causes Mr. McVeigh to be present in the

courtroom.  I assumed it was relevant because they put it

paragraph 13 of the affidavit.

         THE COURT:  I don't believe there is any dispute about

that.  Why do we need a witness?

         MS. OTTO:  There are facts outside 13.

         THE COURT:  What other facts is he going to testify?

         MS. OTTO:  There is nothing about Mr. McVeigh's

demeanor.

         THE COURT:  We have the agent's testimony there --

Agent Hersley.

         MS. OTTO:  I do dispute it.  I am sorry I do dispute

Agent Hersley.

         THE COURT:  What do you dispute about Agent Hersley's

testimony?

         MS. OTTO:  That Mr. McVeigh doesn't have a

conversation with Trooper Hanger about the circumstances of the

firearm.

         THE COURT:  Your evidence is going to be that the

trooper will testify something contrary to what Agent Hersley

said about the weapon?

         MS. OTTO:  He is going to testify in amplification and

it may indeed contradict. I haven't had an opportunity to talk

to Trooper Hanger to have an interview with him prior to this

although I did read his interview with the newspaper.

         THE COURT:  I don't think we have much dispute as far

as the Court is concerned it is very peripheral concerns

relating to the arrest and maybe some testified that has some

bearing on the demeanor of the witness that will might be

relevant but it's a periphery of probable cause I believe.

However, you desire to call Trooper Hanger, you may call him.

         MS. OTTO:  Thank you.

         MR. COYLE:  We do desire to call him.

         THE COURT:  Much of this wi has been stipulated

perhaps this testimony can be abbreviated.

         MS. OTTO:  Yes, Your Honor.

         MR. COYLE:  It's not going to be very windy.  I am

tired.  We would call Trooper Hanger.

         MR. GARLAND:  I am sorry to interrupt.  With respect

to the documents which they have also subpoenaed I would also

like to be heard as to why they should not be --

         THE COURT:  Are we going to introduce some documents?

         MR. COYLE:  I don't know.  We have subpoenaed along with

the trooper.  We issued subpoena duces tecum to get all of the

documents relative to the arrest whether or not they are

consistent with the affidavit of probable cause and his

testimony, I think is important.  I assume that he prepared in

somewhat immediately after the events and all those things are

important and I think we are entitled to them.

         THE COURT:  You are entitled to them eventually.  The

question is whether or not now.

         MR. COYLE:  We would like to be able to review prior

to the time that we put the trooper on the stand more look at

them concurrent with the time we put him on.  I don't seek to

delay.  I seek to see what it is that the trooper has to say

particularly about the demeanor and so forth of this young man.

That's what I wanted to go through.  Not all --

         THE COURT:  I am going to allow him to testify about

the demeanor.  I think the other matters are going to be

developed later in this case and wouldn't be critical for

probable cause concerning, but I am allowing you to do it to

try to permit you to get in all the evidence that might have

any bearing upon probable cause.

         MR. COYLE:  Yes, sir.

         THE COURT:  Testimony about demeanor is what I

understand you are concerned about.

         MR. COYLE:  That's the main thing we are concerned

with and I will assure you I will keep it.

         THE COURT:  Put the trooper on about demeanor and go

on.

         MR. COYLE:  Very well.

                   CHARLES HANGER,

having been first duly sworn to tell the truth, the whole

truth, and nothing but the truth, testified as follows:

              
           D I R E C T     E X A M I N A T I O N

         MR. COYLE:  If I may have just a moment, judge, I am

getting organized.

BY MR. COYLE:

Q.  Good afternoon, sir?

A.  Good afternoon.

Q.  Would you tell the Court your name, please, sir?

A.  Charles J. Hanger.

Q.  How are you employed, sir?

A.  I am a state trooper with the Oklahoma Highway Patrol.

Q.  How long have you been with the Highway Patrol?

A.  Since September, 1976.

Q.  And is it correct, sir, that you were served with a

subpoena duces tecum in a criminal case in this matter to bring

with you certain items relative to the arrest of Timothy

McVeigh?

A.  Yes, I was.

Q.  And did you bring those items?

A.  Yes, I did.

Q.  Your Honor, may I approach the witness and retrieve the

items?

         THE COURT:  Unless there is some objection?

         MR. GARLAND:  Yes, if we are going to be produce

documents I want to heard on this.  I believe this I expressly

barred by 18 United States Code Section 3500. The James Act

bars the subpoena to be used for this purpose until after the

witness testifies at trial for the adverse party.

         MR. COYLE:  The James Act?  He is my witness.

         MR. GARLAND:  That's right.

         MR. COYLE:  He is my witness.  You can discover it

after he testifies at trial.  He is my witness.

         THE COURT:  If you would like to identify the

documents I will let you do that.  I think introduction of the

document will be discovery.

         MR. COYLE:  If the Court please, you issued an order

asking him to bring the documents for us under those

circumstances.

         THE COURT:  I sustained your motion ex parte motion.

         MR. COYLE:  For us to review them.  I can't know what

they are until I look at them.

         THE COURT:  I said they can't be introduced in

evidence I said they would brought to the courtroom.

         MR. COYLE:  Could I see the documents?

         THE COURT:  I am telling you at this time to identify

the documents that I believe the documents themselves the

discovery.  If you would like to identify them -- Trooper, what

documents did you bring with you?

A.  I have a --

         THE COURT:  Describe them in the general.

A.  Probable cause affidavit, confiscated property report, copy

of the summons that I issued, and some jail booking

information.

         THE COURT:  Is that all?

A.  I believe that's all, sir.

Q.  Anything else?  Can I see that now.

         THE COURT:  No, it's discovery.

A.  Sir, I do have one more.

         THE COURT:  I am sorry.  Go ahead.

A.  Videotape.

         THE COURT:  What is that have?

A.  This is a videotape of the car that I stopped there is no

audio on this.

         THE COURT:  Video that is in your vehicle?

A.  Mounted video.

         MR. COYLE:   May I inquire?

         THE COURT:  Yes, sir.

BY MR. COYLE:

Q.  Is this the dash mounted video that you say that you have

with you today when you brought in response to the subpoena,

did that record the arrest of the accused in this case, Mr.

Timothy McVeigh?

A.  It did not.

Q.  Can you tell us why you brought it then?

A.  Listed on that sheet as evidence.

Q.  So you don't have a video of the Mercury in this case or

Mr. McVeigh or any of your activities relative to the stop that

you have told us you performed upon the 19th of April?

A.  You asked if I had a video of the actual arrest.

Q.  Of any of the part of your interaction with Mr. McVeigh on

April 19th?

A.  It depicts the vehicle.  It shows me moving about the

vehicle.   It does not show the arrest nor does it have any

video of Mr. McVeigh.

Q.  All right, can you tell us on the date, sir of April 19,

1995 at about 10:30 a.m. if you came in contact with a person

by the name of Timothy McVeigh?

A.  Yes, it was somewhat before that.

Q.  All right, can you tell us where you first encountered Mr.

McVeigh?

A.  A little over a mile south of the state highway 15 at

Billings exit on Interstate 35 northbound lane.

Q.  What was the reason for this particular vehicle to catch

your attention?

A.  It was not displaying a tag.

Q.  And after you saw it, did you fall in behind it?  Where

A.  The young man with the white t-shirt, khaki pants, and blue

tennis shoes with short dark hair.

Q.  That young man that you see seated there today, he

approached you?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And did he say anything to you at that time?

A.  I believe I made the first statement.

Q.  What did you say to him?  What did you say to him?

A.  I said I stopped you because you don't have a tag.

Q.  What was his response?

A.  He said he had recently purchased the  automobile and

didn't have a tag.

Q.  What did you tell him at that point?

A.  I said could you produce me a bill of sale.

Q.  And tell us what he did?

A.  He said I don't have a bill of sale, the person I bought it

from was still filling it out.

Q.  What did you ask him to do then?

A.  I said how long does it take to fill out a bill of sale.

Q.  And he replied to you?

A.  I don't have one with me.

Q.  What was the next think you said to him?

A.  I asked him for his driver's license.

Q.  Did he retrieve that for you?

A.  He did.

Q.  Was the driver's license that he handed you --

         MR. COYLE:  Your Honor, may I approach?

         THE COURT:  Sure.

BY MR. COYLE:

Q.  Let me hand you please, Trooper Hanger what's been

identified, sir, these proceedings previously as Government

Exhibit No. 3 and ask you is that the driver's license that you

were handed that day?

A.  Yes, it appears to be the same.

Q.  What's the name on that, sir?

A.  Timothy James McVeigh.

Q.  And after you saw that driver's license, what did you then

do after he handed you the driver's license?

A.  I looked at it.

Q.  Okay.

A.  By this time I had noticed a bulge in the left side of his

jacket up under the left edge under his arm.  I looked at the

license, looked at him, and I said would you slowly move your

jacket back so I can look underneath it.

Q.  At that time he told you there was a gun underneath there?

A.  Close to the time as he was easing back, he said I have a

gun.

Q.  Okay, he never made any sort of offensive moves toward you

did he or any sort of aggressive moves toward you?

A.  No, sir.

Q.  At any time did he?

A.  No, sir.

Q.  Was he polite with you?

A.  Yes, sir.

Q.  Was he cooperative you in retrieval of license and removal

of his jacket, every action this young man took during the

course of that stop?

A.  Yes, sir.

Q.  Had you been made aware of the bombing in Oklahoma City at

the time of your stop of this vehicle?

A.  Yes, I had.

Q.  Now, did he then remove the pistol?

A.  No, I grabbed a hold of the jacket and the pistol.

Q.  So you took it away from him and had you drawn your weapon

at that time?

A.  Not at that immediate moment.

Q.  When did you draw your weapon?

A.  I grabbed the jacket and the pistol and instructed him to

put his hands up and as we walked toward the back of the car,

his car, I drew my pistol.

Q.  Did he cooperate in the what you told him to do walk to the

back of the car?

A.  Yes, sir.

Q.  Did he at any time make any aggressive moves toward you

during that period of time?

A.  No, sir.

Q.  And then what did you have him do?

A.  Had him put his hands on the trunk.

Q.  Did he cooperate with you?

A.  Yes, sir.

Q.  Did you then handcuff him?

A.  I removed the pistol first, then I removed a pouch that

contained an extra clip which he told me he had from the same

area where the pistol was on a belt.  Then he told me that he

had a knife.  I removed it through all these items on the

shoulder of the road way then I handcuffed him.

Q.  During all that was he cooperative?

A.  Yes, sir.

Q.  He did that he didn't try to struggle or resist or anything

else, did he?

A.  No, sir.

some checks via my cellular phone.

Q.  Did you run those checks?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And how did his license -- did his license turn up as

valid.

         MR. GARLAND:  Objection, Your Honor, I thought we were

going to with demeanor.  He has wholly testified on that

subject.

         THE COURT:  I thought that's what we were doing.

         MR. COYLE:  Okay, that's good.

BY MR. COYLE:

Q.  Then did he get in the car -- got in your car, right?

A.  I had already put him in my car.

Q.  Okay did you have any conversation with this young man that

you have identified that day?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What was your conversation after you put him in the car?

A.  We had talked about where he purchased the car.

Q.  What did he tell you?

A.  In Junction City, Kansas.

Q.  Did he tell you from whom?

A.  He said it was from a Firestone dealer.

Q.  Anything else he told you?

A.  He told me the salesman's name.

Q.  What was the salesman's name?

A.  Tom.

Q.  What else did he tell you?

A.  I had also mentioned that he had a tag from a car that he

had traded in when he bought this car, but he chose not to put

it on there because it didn't belong there.

Q.  Okay, anything else?

A.  Not that I can think of.

Q.  Did -- he didn't tell you anything else during the whole

time that you had him in custody?

A.  Right after I had handcuffed him and we were standing at

the trunk of his car.

Q.  Yes, sir?

A.  I asked him why was he carrying a weapon.  He said he felt

like he had the right to care am weapon for his own protection.

Q.  Anything else he said to you at that point?

A.  No, sir.

Q.  If he wanted to up until the time that you noticed the

bulge out or about his arm, he was cordial and polite with you;

was he not?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And he in fact had a number of opportunities to pull that

weapon from its location at or about his shoulder; did he not

when you were approaching his vehicle?

A.  Yes.

Q.  As a result of this stop, did you connect him with the

bombing in anyway at the time you stopped him?

A.  Not at all.

Q.  After you talked to him about where he had possibly

purchased the car or where he had purchased the car at Junction

City, did you have any other conversations with him?

A.  Yes, and I am not sure just when it took place, you know

but we talked about where he was coming from.

Q.  Where did he tell you?

A.  He said from Arkansas, said he was in the process of moving

there, had taken a load of belongings to there and was going

back to get more of his belongings.

Q.  Anything else he told you?

         MR. GARLAND:  Your Honor, what we are trying to do

here is discover statements.

         MR. COYLE:  This is statement of the accused.

         MR. GARLAND:  It is statement of the accused, but he

is not entitled to it at this hearing.

         MR. COYLE:  Goes to demeanor, what he was doing.

         THE COURT:  Overruled.

BY MR. COYLE:

Q.  What else did he tell you?

A.  You are talking about statements that he volunteered to me?

Q.  Yes, sir, statements that he made.  You-all talked I guess

all the way to the jail -- wait a minute.  How far were you

from the jail?

A.  I am guessing 18 to 20 miles, maybe not quite that far.

Q.  Took you 15 to 20 minutes to get there, am I correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  During that time you visit with him?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And he was still polite to you, wasn't he?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Did he appear scared or nervous at that point?

A.  No.

Q.  And tell us, please what else he said?

A.  While I was on the cellular phone talking to my dispatcher

I was trying to determine where the car might be registered

at.  Couldn't find anything in Kansas.  I had made a suggestion

the car might be registered in Missouri because I had seen some

type of safety sticker on the windshield.  And he heard me

talking on the phone to my dispatcher.  He said that is an

Arkansas safety sticker, so I told the dispatcher run the check

in Arkansas and they did.

Q.  And did it come back?

A.  Came back to some individual in Arkansas with expired

registration.

Q.  What else -- what other conversation?

A.  I didn't take any notes.  It was just friendly chit chat.

I had read him his Miranda warning.  He said he understood.  I

asked him if he would talk with me.  He said yes, depending on

what you want to ask.  I said would you visit with me just like

we were visiting earlier while we are standing outside.  He

said yes.  Some of those statements I have already told you

followed that.

Q.  Did you read him his Miranda Warning?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Did you read it from a card?

A.  Yes, I did.

Q.  Was he under the influence of anything in your opinion?

         MR. GARLAND:  Your Honor, objection all goes to the

question of possible suppression.  Has nothing to do with

probable cause.

         MR. COYLE:  Sure goes to his demeanor.

         MR. GARLAND:  The rule expressly states the evidence

is not relevant at this hearing.

         THE COURT:  Sustained.

BY MR. COYLE:

Q.  Any other conversation that you recall all the way to the

Noble County Jail?


A.  I had told him how dangerous it was to carry a weapon like

that that a furtive move, wrong move could result in some

officer mistakenly shooting him.

Q.  Anything else that he told you.  What did he say in

response though that statement?

A.  I think he said something like that's possible.

Q.  Anything else he said?

A.  No, it was just chit chat.  I don't remember.  It was

nothing that meant anything to me at the time.  It was just

might have said a few things on the way down there.  I didn't

take any notes and I can't expressly tell you what that was.

Q.  Do you keep a tape-recorder with you?

A.  No, I do not.

Q.  Did you search Mr. McVeigh's car?

A.  Yes, I did.

         MR. GARLAND:  Objection, Your Honor. I thought this

was going -- objection, Your Honor I thought this was going to

be only about the demeanor of the witness.

         THE COURT:  Sustained.

         MR. COYLE:  I believe that's all.  Thank you, sir.

         THE COURT:  Any questions.

         MR. GARLAND:  No.

         THE COURT:  You maybe excused.  May we open the

documents that have been heretofore sealed with regard to this?

         MR. COYLE:  I would ask.

         MS. OTTO:  Are the documents we are talking about are

applications for the subpoena and issuance of the subpoena?

         THE COURT:  I just wanted to know.

         MS. OTTO:  I don't see any particular problem with

that.

         THE COURT:  They will be unsealed then.  Anything

further?

         MS. OTTO:  No, Your Honor, nothing further.

         THE COURT:  All the evidence in on behalf of the

Defendant?

         MS. OTTO:  Yes, Your Honor.

         THE COURT:  Counsel care to make any statements

regarding probable cause or the detention issue.

         MR. GARLAND:  I would like to be heard on detention.

Do  you want to make a ruling on probable cause or do you want

to do them both at the same time?

          THE COURT:  Same time.

         MR. GARLAND:  Your Honor, we will rest on entry of the

evidence with respect to the probable cause.

    With respect to the detention, Your Honor I would ask that

he be detained pending the trial.  18 U.S.C. Section 3142E

finds that the Court-- states that the Court must order

detention if it finds no conditions were reasonably assure the

appearance of any person as required and the safety of any

other person in the community.

     First, Your Honor, we believe that the presumption that no

condition can assure these -- both the appearance and safety

apply here.   The statute provides that if there is probable

cause to believe that the Defendant has violated 18 U.S.C.

924C that presumption applies.

    You have heard evidence,  Your Honor, more than sufficient

to establish that during and relation to a crime of violence

the Defendant used and carried a destructive device that is a

bomb.  Therefore, the presumption applies and should be

detained.  Even without the presumption, we would make the

following arguments, Your Honor:  With respect to appearance,

this Defendant has no fixed residence or community ties.  He

has lived in multiple states over the last small period of

time.

    He gave a South Dakota address at the Ryder Truck rental.

He had a Michigan license and a Michigan address at the time of

his arrest investigation has shown he has resided in both New

York and Arizona during this same time.  That goes to the

question of whether he has community ties.  It's one of the

factors listed.  In addition, Your Honor, as everyone knows he

faces the possibility of the death penalty in this case and

enormous incentive to flee.  The government represents no

condition would prevent a person in that situation from

fleeing.

    Finally, Your Honor with respect to the safety of the

community, the statute directs us to look at the nature of the

offense and could not imagine a more heinous offense than

this.

    The Defendant has shown a willingness to kill innocent

children, law enforcement officers,  and ordinary people going

about their ordinary lives.  No series of the conditions could

reasonably assure his appearance or the safety of other persons

in the community.  For that reason, he should be detained.

         MR. COYLE:  We will waive argument.

         THE COURT:  All evidence is in.  All arguments have

been submitted  by counsel.  This is before the Court on

decision of issue of probable cause and the government for

detention.  The Defendant is charged with the statute that is

set out in Section 844 Title 18 specifically paragraph F

principal elements of that statute are malicious damage by an

explosive to a federal -- to federal property and if death

results to any person then the penalties provisions are also

included in that statute.

    The Court finds that all elements of that statute are

satisfied by probable cause evidence that has been introduced

in the case.  The Court also finds that an indelible train of

evidence -- trail of evidence that starts in Junction City and

ends up at the front door of the Murrah Building.

    The Defendant has been identified in person at both

locations both Junction City and also in Oklahoma City by

several witnesses, also vehicles that the specific Ryder Truck

and also the Mercury were identified at both locations.

    I will not detail all of the evidence because I think the

evidence is highly credible as introduced by the United States

and that the Court believes and finds there is ample and

sufficient probable cause to hold the Defendant for further

proceedings in District Court.

    He has been identified both in person and also through the

elements of this offense.  The Court has no idea of what

further prosecution or how that will take place that is in

discretion of the United States Attorney's Office.

    The detention issue I think is taken care of the severity

of the offense and the Court makes a finding ample clear and

convincing evidence based upon the nature of the offense and

what I think is highly credible probable cause evidence to

detain the Defendant pending further proceedings, and I believe

that evidence is clear and convincing and I believe he should

be detained for both risk of flight and serious dangerous to

the community.

    At this time I want to express my  appreciation to defense

counsel who have performed with great skill and professionalism

at the Court's direction representing the Defendant in these

proceedings.

    I would like to ask if the Defendant desires to proceed

with appointed counsel or if the Court's receive a financial

affidavit which he should complete and I will ask counsel to

confer with him about that so that its accurate and I would ask

if he could do that at this time before we leave this

proceeding.

         MS. OTTO:  Yes, Your Honor, we can assist him in

that.  He would have to be unhandcuffed to assist us in the

preparation of that.

    Also before we leave today I would like to request that the

Court consider a matter that we take very seriously.  We have

heard a great deal of testimony today about various witnesses,

some of whom place Mr. McVeigh in Oklahoma City on various

dates.  Some of these witnesses claim to have seen Mr. McVeigh

on the date in question, and many of these witnesses have not

been shown at this point either a photo spread or a live

lineup.

    Ms. Joplin contacted Mr. Coyle and I late last week, I

think, it would have been Saturday.  Leslie Maye was actually

person who contacted Mr. Coyle initially about the live lineup

that was conducted Saturday night at the Oklahoma County Jail.

Mr. Coyle and I were present.  We were present during the

composition of the lineup although we were not allowed to

participate in it.

    We were also present in the room when the witnesses were

brought into participate in the live lineup and we certainly

agree with Ms. Joplin's assessment that was was an appropriate

procedure.  One of the great concerns in any case that release

in part on eyewitness identification is a part of eyewitness

identification taint.

    And I certainly believe there is a high degree of

probability in this case that any eyewitness or alleged

eyewitness who is brought forward by the government will in all

likelihood have witnessed Mr. McVeigh in essentially a repeated

every half hour for a couple days show up on CNN and the local

stations in the company of Federal Bureau of Investigation,

United States Marshals, and local deputies. He is the man in

orange surrounded  by all of the other gentleman, and we are

very concerned that because of the intense and pervasive

publicity in this case that there is a very high degree of

probability of all of the alleged eyewitnesses at this point

have been tainted.

    We were therefore going to request that an order be entered

directing the government to conduct only live lineups with

these witnesses and that we be present at any and all live line

ups.  In the event the Court declines to enter such an order

and allows the government to proceed with FBI photo spread,

identification, again we ask to be present during any photo

spread display that might be conducted by the government.

    I think it is absolutely critical as long as we are Mr.

McVeigh's attorneys and I make this request on behalf of any

counsel who would succeed us as Mr. McVeigh's representatives

in this case, it is absolutely essential to the preparation of

an effective defense that we be allowed to see and hear from

the witnesses own mouth what he or she says about this

identification.

    I understand Agent Hersley  was not present at the live

lineup.  I was.  And the eyewitness identification of those two

people who sort of identified Mr. McVeigh in the lineup was

equivocal at best.

    Without Counsel being present during any attempted

identification of Mr. McVeigh, Counsel will lose that

opportunity forever.  We simply cannot rely on any government

agent or government lawyer, however, well intentioned to listen

with a degree of critical discernment that any criminal defense

lawyer would.

    I understand the government -- I understand the government

is actively pursuing this case and that they want to see

justice be done, and I think this is a request that is entirely

consistent with seeing that justice is done.

         THE COURT:  I would prefer your oral request matter of

record and I prefer that you submit a written motion and brief.

         MR. COYLE:  Yes, Your Honor, could we ask the government

to refrain from  conducting any lineups until I am able to do

that?  We would also like for it to be recorded a video record

to be made so that the jury in the future could judge for

themselves.

         THE COURT:  You want to agree to that?

         MR. GARLAND:  No, Your Honor, in the most strenuous

way.  With respect to live lineups, of course, we will allow

them to be present.  We allowed them to be present at the last

one we have notified.  I have never heard of a court making the

order which they just cited,  and I would be surprised if we

ever see one.  We will drastically put behind this

investigation if you prevent us from doing photo spreads until

such time they were able to put together --

         MS. OTTO:  If the government is concerned about

delaying this investigation, I suggest we could cure that

problem by simply asking the government to record any

conversations that they have with the eyewitnesses.  I do know

that the FBI is in possession of tape-recorders because they

tape-recorded one of my clients.

    I understand it is not their usual course of business, but

in light of the severity of this case and the possible

punishment that Mr. McVeigh faces if he is convicted, I think

it's a small  consession for the government to make to record

any conversations that they have during the course of a photo

spread lineup.  It seems a very modest request under the

circumstances.

         THE COURT:  My basic responsibility at this point I

think are over in this case.  However, for whatever authority I

may have in connection with this.  I prefer that you submit a

written motion.

         MS. OTTO:  Your Honor, Your Honor,  you are the only

judicial officer with jurisdiction at this point and I am very

serious about this request.

         THE COURT:  I just prefer, Ms. Otto, that it be a

written motion.

         MS. OTTO:  I certainly will prepare that and I hope to

have it submitted tomorrow.  I would hope that the government

would at least record any conversations with witnesses in the

meantime.

         MR. GARLAND:  Your Honor, we will not.  We will only

do what the law requires and what the law requires with respect

to lineups we will provide them with information.  We will not

record conversation with prospective witnesses.  I want to make

that very clear.  I do not believe they will find a single case

in which that has been ordered.  I don't believe that is within

the authority of this Court to order.

         THE COURT:  I have some divergent opinions.  I think I

would rather have a motion.

         MS. OTTO:  I understand, Your Honor.  I doubt the

government will find a single can case that says its outside

your authority.

         THE COURT:  Anything further at this time?

         MS. OTTO:  Nothing further upon behalf of the

Defendant.

         THE COURT:  May I ask that this affidavit be completed

and since if the Defendant has any questions and perhaps that

can be taken care of so I can -- I understand he desires at

this point to proceed with appointed Counsel, so I would like

to have that affidavit on file.

         THE COURT:  Hearing is recessed and everyone can be

excused.

    (THE PRELIMINARY HEARING WAS CONCLUDED AND THE COURT WAS IN

RECESS.)

                   AFFIDAVIT

    I, Patrick W. Wease, being sworn, state:

1.  I am an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and
    have been so employed for 16 years.  I am vested with
    authority to investigate violations of federal laws, including
    Title 18, United States Code, Section 371, and Title 26,
    United States Code, Section 5861.

2.  The following information has been received by the Federal
    Bureau of Investigation on April 19 through 25, 1995.

3.  On April 21, 1995, JAMES DOUGLAS NICHOLS was interviewed in
    Decker, Michigan.  During this interview, JAMES NICHOLS stated
    that he is the brother of TERRY NICHOLS and is a friend of
    TIMOTHY JAMES MCVEIGH and that both have visited  and/or
    resided with him at his farm in Decker, Michigan, over the
    past several years.  JAMES NICHOLS further stated that he has
    observed MCVEIGH and TERRY NICHOLS making and exploding
    "bottle bombs" at his residence in 1992, using brake fluid,
    gasoline, and diesel fuel.  JAMES NICHOLS further stated that
    he participated with MCVEIGH and TERRY NICHOLS in making
    "bottle bombs" in 1992, and that in 1994 he, JAMES NICHOLS,
    has made small explosive devices using prescription vials,
    pyrodex, blasting caps, and safety fuse.  JAMES NICHOLS
    further stated that he was aware of "survival books" belonging
    to his brother, TERRY NICHOLS, and that he knew that those
    books contained information about making bombs and information
    dealing with ammonium nitrate bombs.  JAMES NICHOLS further
    stated that he believed that TIMOTHY MCVEIGH had the knowledge
    to manufacture a bomb.  JAMES NICHOLS denied that he had ever
    purchased ammonium nitrate, and stated that he had no
    knowledge that TERRY NICHOLS or TIMOTHY MCVEIGH ever purchased
    any.

4.  On or about April 21 through April 24, 1995, FBI agents
    conducted a search of the farm belonging to JAMES NICHOLS in
    Decker, Michigan.  One of the buildings searched was a pole
    barn, in which the agents found, among other items, the
    following:  28 fifty pound bags of fertilizer containing
    ammonium nitrate; a 55 gallon drum containing fuel oil; large
    quantities of 35% solution of hydrogen peroxide; and 1/2 pint
    of aluminum powder.  Also located at the farm were large fuel
    tanks, which appeared to contain diesel fuel.  All of these
    materials can be used as ingredients in improvised explosives.
    In addition, located in the farm house, the agents found a
    supply of non-electric blasting caps, pyrodex (black powder),
    and safety fuse.  In addition, in a field located in the
    vicinity of the farm buildings, the agents found jagged-edged
    metal fragments, which appear to be shrapnel from the
    detonation of explosive devices.

5.  An interview conducted on April 21, 1995, with Daniel Stomber,
    5896 Deckerville Road, Evergreen Township, Decker, Michigan,
    reveals that he was present at the farm of JAMES NICHOLS on
    several occasions when JAMES NICHOLS and TERRY NICHOLS
    manufactured small explosive devices. Stomber explained that
    the Nichols brothers would mix fertilizer, peroxide, and
    bleach in plastic pop bottles and detonate them around the
    Nichols farm.  Stomber recalls JAMES stating, "We're getting
    better at it" when he referred to the bombmaking.

6.  Stomber recalls an individual named Tim (last name unknown)
    who had moved onto the Nichols farm last year.  Stomber
    described Tim as a guy that wore camouflage clothing
    frequently and carried a pistol.  Stomber believes Tim moved
    out in the spring of 1994.

7.  Stomber recalls JAMES NICHOLS and TERRY NICHOLS frequently
    making derogatory comments about the incident at Waco, Texas,
    and the federal government.

8.  On April 21, 1995, Paul Isydorak, a neighbor of JAMES NICHOLS,
    was interviewed. Isydorak stated that JAMES NICHOLS was
    always  "fooling around" with common household materials to
    determine what type of explosive value they had, Isydorak
    specifically recalls Nichols mentioning ammonia as one of the
    experimental substances. He further recalls observing TERRY
    NICHOLS and TIM MCVEIGH at the farm participating in
    the experimentation with explosives.

9.  On April 21, 1995, Isydorak visited a local bar with JAMES
    NICHOLS.  He overheard JAMES in a conversation with the
    bartender in which James explained that different types of
    explosives are used to create different type of explosive
    effects.

10. On April 21, 1995, a cooperating individual who has requested
    that his/her identity be protected (hereinafter CI #1) advised
    Virgil Strickler, the Sheriff of Sanilac County, Michigan,
    that on or around December 12 or 15, 1993, two individuals
    visited Thumb Hobbies, Etc., a hobby store in Marlette,
    Michigan. Marlette is approximately 20 miles from Decker,
    Michigan. These two individuals inquired about purchasing 100%
    liquid nitro model airplane fuel. They also wanted to
    purchase 200 heavy duty zip-lock bags measuring 3 x 5 or 3 x 6
    inches. The two were advised that the store only carried 10-
    15% liquid nitro model airplane fuel, but that 100% fuel could
    be ordered. One of the two gave his name as Terry Tuttle,
    with a contact phone number of (517) 872-4008, and stated they
    would return. Approximately two weeks later, the two
    individuals returned ad were informed that the store could
    not or would not obtain the 100% liquid nitro model airplane
    fuel for them. The individuals stated that this was okay, as
    they had found another source for the fuel. The two
    individuals were described by CI #1 as white males,
    approximately 20 to 30 years of age. I have been advised by
    an FBI agent with explosives expertise that 100% liquid nitro
    model airplane fuel can be used in the manufacture of
    improvised explosives, in conjunction with an oxidizer such as
    hydrogen peroxide.

11. Investigation to date conducted by the FBI has determined that
    "Terry Tuttle" and "Tim Tuttle" are known aliases of TIMOTHY
    MCVEIGH. In addition, the telephone number left at the hobby
    store by "Terry Tuttle," (517) 872-4008, is one digit
    different from JAMES NICHOLS' telephone number of
    (517) 872-4018. Also, during the April 21 through April 24,
    1995, search of the Nichols farm, mail addressed to Tim or
    Terry Tuttle was observed inside the residence.

12. An interview was conducted on April 24, 1995, with a
    cooperating individual who has requested that his/her identity
    be protected (hereinafter "CI #2"). CI #2 advised that during
    the period between August 1987 and May 1990, he/she had
    occasion to visit the NICHOLS farm on a regular basis, 
    approximately 3 or 4 times each year. Approximately 6 years
    ago, CI #2, during a visit to a shed on the Nichols farm,
    detected a strong odor of diesel fuel, which he/she described
    as stronger than on prior occasions. NICHOLS explained that
    they had been having fun making cardboard bombs. CI #2
    observed an empty cardboard milk carton sitting on a work
    bench in the shed. Also observed in the he shed by CI #2 was a
    large pile of urea fertilizer, approximately fifty 50-pound
    bags, which CI #2 knows is a nitrogen source of fertilizer.
    CI #2 stated that he/she has never seen such a sizeable
    amount of fertilizer.

13. CI #2 recalls that his/her next visit to the NICHOLS farm
    occurred shortly after some type of bombing disaster had
    occurred in the world. CI #2 stated that NICHOLS rambled
    nervously about the United States being responsible for this
    bombing disaster. NICHOLS went on to explain how a small bomb
    can do damage such as what had just occurred in the disaster.

14. CI #2 advised that NICHOLS repeatedly blamed the federal
    government for all of the problems in the world, stating that
    he despised the United States Government.

15. Based upon the above information, there is probable cause to
    believe that from 1992 through 1995, in the Eastern District
    of Michigan and elsewhere, defendant JAMES DOUGLAS NICHOLS has
    conspired with each other and with other persons, including
    TERRY NICHOLS and TIMOTHY JAMES MCVEIGH, to make and possess
    firearms, that is, destructive devices, that were not
    registered to them in the National Firearms Registration and
    Transfer Record, and that were made in violation of the
    provisions of Chapter 53 of Title 26, United States Code;
    all in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section
    371 and Title 26, United States Code, Section 5861.

                             ____________________________________

Name and Title of Judicial Officer   Signature of Judicial Officer



STATE OF OKLAHOMA:

COUNTY OF OKLAHOMA



                              AFFIDAVIT

    I, HENRY C. GIBBONS, being duly sworn, do hereby state
that I am an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
having been so employed for 26 years and as such am vested with
the authority to investigate violations of federal laws,
including Title 18, United States Code, Section 844 (f).

    Further, the Affiant states as follows:

    1.  The following information has been received by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation over the period from April 19
through April 21, 1995;

    2.  On April 19, 1995, a massive explosion detonated
outside the Alfred P. Murrah building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma,
at approximately 9:00 a.m.

    3.  Investigation by Federal agents at the scene of
the explosion have determined that the explosive was contained in
a 1993 Ford owned by Ryder Rental company.

          a. A vehicle identification number (VIN) was
    found at the scene of the explosion and determined to
    be from a part of the truck that contained the
    explosive.

          b. The VIN was traced to a truck owned by Ryder
    Rentals of Miami, Florida.

          c. Ryder Rentals informed the FBI that the truck
    was assigned to a rental company known as Elliot's Body
    Shop in Junction City, Kansas.

    4. The rental agent at Elliot's Body Shop in Junction
City, Kansas was interviewed by the FBI on April 19, 1995.
The individual who signed the rental agreement provided the
following information:

          a. The person who signed the rental agreement
    identified himself as BOB KLING, SSN: 962-42-9694,
    South Dakota's driver's license number YF942A6, and
    provided a home address of 428 Malt Drive, Redfield,
    South Dakota. The person listed the destination as 428
    Maple Drive, Omaha, Nebraska.

          b. Subsequent investigation conducted by the FBI
    determine all this information to be bogus.

    5. On April 20, 1995, the rental agent was
recontacted and assisted in the creation of composite drawings.
The rental agent has told the FBI that the composite drawings are
fair and accurate depictions of the individuals who rented the
truck.

    6. On April 20, 1995, the FBI interviewed three
witnesses who wre near the scene of the explosion at Alfred P.
Murrah Federal Building prior to the determination of the
explosives.  The three witnesses were shown a copy of the
composite drawing of Unsub #1 and identified him as closely
resembling a person the witnesses had seen in front of the Alfred
P. Murrah Building where the explosion occurred on April
19, 1995.  The witnesses advised the FBI that they observed a
person identified as Unsub #1 at approximately 8:40 a.m. on April
19, 1995, when they entered the building.   They again observed
Unsub #1 at approximately 8:55 a.m., still in front of the 5th
Road entrance of the building when they departed just minutes
before the explosion.

  7.  The Alfred P. Murrah building is used by various
agencies of the United States, including Agriculture Department
Department of the Army, the Defense Department, Federal Highway
Administration, General Accouinting Office, General Services
Administration, Social Security Administration, Labor Department,
Marine Corps, Small Business Administration, Transportation
Department, United States Secret Service, Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, and Veteran's Administration.

  8.  The composite drawings were shown to employees at
various motels and commercial establishments in the Junction
City, Kansas, vicinity.  Employees of the Dreamland Motel in
Junction City Kansas, advised FBI agents that an individual
resembling Unsub #1 depicted in the composite drawings had been a
guest at the Motel from April 14 through April 18, 1995.   This
individual had registered at the Motel under the name of Tim
McVeigh, listed his automobile as bearing an Oklahoma license
plate with an illegible plate number, and provided a Michigan
address, on North Van Dyke Road in Decker, Michigan.
The individual was seen driving a car described as a Mercury
from the 1970's.

   9.  A check of Michigan Department of motor Vehicle records
shows a license in the name of Timothy J. McViegh, date of birth
April 23, 1968, with an address of 3616 North Nan Dyke Road,
Decker, Michigan.  This Michigan license was renewed by McViegh
on April 8, 1995.  McViegh had a prior license issued in the
state of Kansas on March 21, 1990, and surrendered to Michigan in
November 1993, with the following address: P.O. Box 2153, Fort
Riley, Kansas.

   10.  Further investigation shows that the property at 3616
North Van Dyke Road, Decker, Michigan, is associated with James
Douglas Nichols and his brother Terry Lynn Nichols.  The property
is a working farm.  Terry Nichols formerly resided in Marion,
Kansas, which is approximately one hour from Junction City.

   11.  A relative of James Nichols reports to the FBI that Tim
McViegh is a friend and associate of James Nichols, who has
worked and resided at the farm on North Van Dyke Road in Decker,
worked and resided ast the farm on North Van Dyke Road in Decker,
Michigan.  This relative further reports that she had heard that
James Nichols had been involved in constructing bombs in
approximately November 1994, and that he possessed large
quantities of fuel oil and fertilizer.

   12.  On April 21, 1995, a former co-worker of Tim McViegh's
reported to the FBI that he had seen the composite drawing of
Unsub #1 on the television and recognized the drawing to be a
former co-worker, Tim McViegh.  He further advised that
McVeigh was known known to hold extreme rightwing views, was a
military veteran, and was particularly agitated about the conduct
of the federal government in Waco, Texas, in 1993.  In fact, the
co-worker further reports that McViegh had been so agitated about
the deaths of the Branch Dividians in Waco, Texas, on April 19,
1993, that he personnnaly visited the site.  After visiting
the site, McViegh expressed extreme anger at the federal
government and advised that the Governemnt should never had done
what it did.  He further advised that the last known address he
had for McViegh is 1711 Stockton Hill Road, #206, Kingman,
Arizona.

  13.  On April 21, 1994, investigators learned that a Timothy
McViegh was arrested at 10:30 a.m. on April 19, 1995, in Perry,
Oklahoma, for not having a lisencse tag and for possession of a
weapon approxiamtely 1-1/2 hours after the detonation of the
expolosive device at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  Perry, Oklahoma, is approximately a 1-
1/2 hour drive from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  McViegh, who has
been held in custody since his arrest on April 19, 1995, listed
his home address as 3616 North Van Dyke Road, Decker, Michigan.
He listed James Nichols of Decker, Michigan, as a reference.
McViegh was stopped driving a yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis.

  14.  The detonation of the explosive in front of the Alfred
P. Murrah Federal Building constitutes a violation of 18 U.S.C.
Section 844(f), which makes it a crime to maliciously damage or
destroy by means of an explosive any building or real property,
in whole or in part owned, possessed or used by the United
States, or any department or agency thereof.

   Further, your affiant sayeth not.

Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in the Western District of 
Oklahoma and elsewhere,  
 
TIMOTHY JAMES McVEIGH 
 
and 
 
TERRY LYNN NICHOLS, 
 
the defendants herein, did knowingly, intentionally, 
willfully and maliciously conspire, combine and agree 
together and with others unknown to the Grand Jury to use 
a weapon of mass destruction, namely an explosive bomb 
placed in a truck (a "truck bomb"), against persons within 
the United States and against property that was owned and 
used by the United States and by a department and agency 
of the United States, namely, the Alfred P. Murrah Federal 
Building at 200 N.W. 5th Street, Oklahoma City, 
Oklahoma, resulting in death, grievous bodily injury and 
destruction of the building.  
 
2. It was the object of the conspiracy to kill and injure 
innocent persons and to damage property of the United

THE MANNER AND MEANS USED BY THE 
CONSPIRATORS TO FURTHER THE OBJECTS OF 
THE CONSPIRACY

further the objects of the conspiracy were the following:  
 
3. McVEIGH and NICHOLS planned an act of violence 
against persons and property of the United States.  
 
4. McVEIGH and NICHOLS selected the Alfred P. Murrah 
Federal Building and its occupants as the targets of their act 
of violence and McVEIGH attempted to recruit others to 
assist in the act of violence.

obtain the components of a truck bomb, including a truck, 
ammonium nitrate, racing and diesel fuel, detonation cord 
and other explosive materials.

the truck bomb components and stolen property.  
 
7. McVEIGH and NICHOLS used stolen property and its 
proceeds to help finance their act of violence.

calling card that they had acquired in a false name as a 
means of concealing their true identities and as a means of 
preventing calls from being traced to them.  
 
9. McVEIGH and NICHOLS used different false names in 
business transactions as a means of concealing their true 
identities, their whereabouts and the true intent of their 
activities.  
 
10. McVEIGH and NICHOLS constructed an explosive 
truck bomb, and McVEIGH placed it outside the Alfred P. 
Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, 
where he detonated the bomb.

Re: Michael Fortier 
 
 
Dear Mr. McGuire: 
 
The United States of America understands that your client, 
Michael Fortier, wishes to resolve his criminal liability in 
the above-titled matter. This letter sets forth the terms and 
conditions under which the government will enter into a 
disposition of this matter with Mr. Fortier.  
 
1. CHARGES. Mr. Fortier agrees to enter a plea of guilty to 
an Indictment or Information that charges him with the 
following four offenses:  
 
(a) conspiring with Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols to 
transport in interstate commerce and sell stolen firearms, 
having reasonable cause to believe the firearms were stolen, 
in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371;  
 
(b) transporting stolen firearms in interstate commerce on 
or about December 17, 1994, having reasonable cause to 
believe the firearms were stolen, in violation of Title 18, 
United States Code, Section 922(i);  
 
(c) making a materially false statement in a matter within 
the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice between April 
21 and April 24, 1995, by falsely denying to FBI agents 
that he had knowledge of the plans of Timothy McVeigh 
and Terry Nichols to bomb the federal building in 
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in violation of Title 18, United 
States Code, Section 1001; and  
 
(d) concealing and not making known as soon as possible 
to a person in civil authority under the United States his 
knowledge of the actual commission of a felony cognizable 
by a court of the United States -- that is, the bombing of the 
federal building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma -- in 
violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 4.  
 
Mr. Fortier agrees to waive any claim concerning venue 
and to waive any right to appeal except his right to appeal 
an unlawful sentence.  
 
2. FACTUAL ADMISSION OF GUILT. Mr. Fortier 
admits that he is in fact guilty of the charges set forth in the 
previous paragraph, and he will make a factual admission 
of guilt before the court.  
 
3. POTENTIAL PENALTIES. Mr. Fortier understands that 
the maximum penalties to which he may be sentenced are 
as follows:  
 
(a) Five years imprisonment, a $250,000 fine, a term of 
supervised release of at least 3 years, and a special 
assessment of $50 for the violation of 18 U.S.C.  371;  
 
(b) Ten years imprisonment, a $250,000 fine, a term of 
supervised release of at least 3 years, and a special 
assessment of $50 for the violation of 18 U.S.C.  922(i);  
 
(c) Five years imprisonment, a $250,000 fine, a term of 
supervised release of at least 3 years, and a special 
assessment of $50 for the violation of 18 U.S.C.  1001; and  
 
(d) Three years imprisonment, a $250,000 fine, a term of 
supervised release of at least 1 year, and a special 
assessment of $50 for the violation of 18 U.S.C.  4.  
 
Mr. Fortier further understands that the sentencing court 
may order that the sentence for each offense be served 
consecutive- ly to the sentence of every other offense, 
except that the terms of supervised release for all four 
offenses must be ordered to run concurrently. Mr. Fortier 
also understands that the sentencing court must order a 
special assessment of $50 for each offense of conviction. 
Thus, Mr. Fortier understands that he could be sentenced to 
a total of 23 years imprisonment, a $1,000,000 fine, and 3 
years supervised release, and that he must be ordered to pay 
a special assessment of $200.  
 
4. SENTENCING GUIDELINES. Mr. Fortier understands 
that the sentence to be imposed on him, which may be up to 
the maximum penalty allowed by law, will be determined 
solely by the sentencing judge, and that the United States 
cannot and does not make any promises, representations or 
predictions regarding what sentence the judge will impose. 
Mr. Fortier further understands that his sentence will be 
determined in accordance with the guidelines and policies 
promulgated by the United States Sentencing Commission, 
but that the judge may depart from those guidelines under 
some circumstances. Mr. Fortier understands that if the 
judge imposes a sentence greater than that provided in the 
sentencing guidelines, or which is in any other way 
unsatisfactory to him, he cannot withdraw his guilty plea. 
This does not, however, limit Mr. Fortier's right to appeal 
an unlawful sentence.  
 
5. COOPERATION. Mr. Fortier agrees that he will 
continue to cooperate completely, candidly, and truthfully 
with all investigators and attorneys of the United States, by 
truthfully providing all information in his possession 
relating directly or indirectly to all criminal activity and 
related matters of which he has knowledge. He will neither 
falsely implicate nor falsely protect any other person. Mr. 
Fortier will provide such informa- tion whenever, and in 
whatever form the United States shall reasonably request. 
This includes, but is not limited to, submitting to interviews 
at such reasonable times and places as are determined by 
counsel for the United States, providing all documents and 
other tangible evidence requested of him, and testifying 
completely and truthfully before any grand jury, or at any 
trial or other proceeding. The parties agree to seek a 
continuance of Mr. Fortier's sentencing until he has 
completed his cooperation and rendered his testimony, 
including any trial testimony, as described in this 
paragraph.  
 
6. SECTION 3553(e) MOTION. If Mr. Fortier completely 
fulfills all of his obligations under this agreement, at the 
time of sentencing the United States will advise the 
sentencing judge of the full nature, extent and value of the 
cooperation provided by Mr. Fortier. In addition, the United 
States will evaluate the information provided by Mr. Fortier 
pursuant to the preceding paragraph. If the government 
determines, in its sole discretion, that Mr. Fortier has 
rendered substantial assistance in the investigation and 
prosecution of others involved in criminal activities, then it 
will file a motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3553(e) and 
Sentencing Guideline  5K1.1, which will so advise the 
judge. Mr. Fortier understands, however, that the 
sentencing judge will have the sole discretion to determine 
the actual sentence, and the government cannot and does 
not make any promises, represen- tations or predictions 
regarding what sentence the judge will impose.  
 
7. ADDITIONAL CHARGES. If Mr. Fortier completely 
fulfills all of his obligations under this agreement, the 
United States agrees -- except as provided below -- to bring 
no additional criminal charges against him related to his 
involvement with Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols. 
This agreement applies only to conduct concluded prior to 
the date of this agreement, and only to the extent that Mr. 
Fortier has informed the United States of that involvement 
prior to the signing of this agreement. This agreement does 
not apply to any further charges which could be brought 
against Mr. Fortier for actions related to different matters 
than those described in this paragraph. Mr. Fortier 
understands that the State of Oklahoma, through the 
District Attorney for Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, Robert 
Macy, has been fully informed of the terms of this 
agreement and has agreed that, if Mr. Fortier fully complies 
with the terms of this agreement and fully cooperates with 
the State of Oklahoma, then no additional criminal charges 
will be filed against Mr. Fortier by the State of Oklahoma.  
 
8. ALLOCUTION AND STEP-BACK. The United States 
reserves the right to allocute fully at sentencing, to inform 
the Probation Office of any relevant facts, and to correct 
any discrepancies in the presentence report. The United 
States will request that Mr. Fortier be detained pending 
sentencing, and Mr. Fortier agrees not to object.  
 
9. BREACH OF AGREEMENT. If further investigation 
discloses that Mr. Fortier conspired to bomb any federal 
building, or if Mr. Fortier fails to comply with any of the 
provisions of this agreement, or refuses to answer any 
questions put to him, or makes any false or misleading 
statements to investigators or attorneys of the United 
States, or makes any false or misleading statements or 
commits any perjury before any grand jury or court, or 
commits any further crimes, then the United States will 
have the right to characterize such conduct as a substantial 
breach of this agreement, in which case the obligations of 
the United States under this agreement will be void and the 
United States will have the right to prosecute Mr. Fortier 
for any and all offenses that can be charged against him in 
any district or state.  
 
10. USE OF INFORMATION. Mr. Fortier understands 
that, except in the circumstances described in this 
paragraph, the United States will not use against him any 
statements he makes pursuant to this plea agreement in any 
criminal case, other than a prosecution for perjury, giving a 
false statement, or obstructing justice. Mr. Fortier agrees 
that: (a) The United States may use against him information 
directly or indirectly derived from statements he makes or 
information he provides pursuant to this plea agreement, 
and may pursue and use against him the fruits of any 
investigative leads suggested by such statements or other 
information; (b) In the event Mr. Fortier is ever a witness in 
any trial or other judicial proceeding, the government may 
cross-examine him concerning any statements he makes or 
other information he provides pursuant to this plea 
agreement; (c) At any trial or other judicial proceeding, the 
government may introduce evidence regarding such 
statements or other information in rebuttal; (d) Statements 
he makes and information he provides pursuant to this plea 
agreement may be used in the plea and sentencing 
proceedings on the charges described in paragraph 1 above, 
which are the subject of this agreement; and (e) In the event 
of a breach of this agreement as described in the preceding 
paragraph, any statements made or information provided by 
Mr. Fortier, whether subsequent to or prior to this 
agreement, may be used against him, without limitation, in 
any federal, state or local prosecution. Mr. Fortier 
knowingly and voluntarily waives any rights he may have, 
pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 410 and Fed. R. Crim. P. 
11(e)(6), which might otherwise prohibit the use against 
him of such information under the circumstances just 
described.  
 
11. NO OTHER AGREEMENTS. No other agreements, 
promises, understandings or representations have been 
made by the parties or their counsel than those contained in 
writing herein, nor will any such agreements, promises, 
understandings or representations be made unless 
committed to writing and signed by Mr. Fortier, his 
counsel, and an authorized representative of the United 
States.  
 
If your client agrees to the conditions set forth in this letter, 
please sign the original and return it to me.  
 
Sincerely, 
 
PATRICK M. RYAN 
United States Attorney

<P>An affidavit signed by Terry Nichols, affirming his constitutional rights and disavowing his legal responsibility to pay taxes to the IRS. Attached to the affidavit is a mailing list of 33 political leaders, including President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, Senator Bob Dole and Attorney General Janet Reno.</P>
<HR WIDTH=525 ALIGN=LEFT>
<PRE>
AFFIDAVIT 
 
To Service List On Reverse Side, with Two Witnesses of 
Mailing and This: 
 
I, Terry L. Nichols do Lawfully Affirm as follows this date: 
 
1. I am a NATURAL-BORN, FREE adult Citizen of the 
State of Michigan by birth, thus of America, and an 
inhabitant of the State of Kansas, thankfully endowed by our 
Creator God with Unalienable Rights enumerated in 
America's founding organic documents, which I have never 
with knowingly intelligent acts waived; and I freely choose 
to obey all American Law and pay all Lawful taxes in 
jurisdictions applicable to me for the common good. I stand 
in Proper Person with Assistance, Special. The foregoing, 
including my STATUS and Unalienable Rights, are not 
negotiable. My Status, in accord, is stated for all in 1:2:3, 
2:1:5, 3:2:1 and 4:2:1 of the U.S. Constitution. 
 
2. Recent diligent studies have convinced me of the above 
and that as such I am not "subject to" the territorially-limited 
"exclusive Legislation" and its foreign jurisdiction mandated 
for Washington, D.C., ect. in our U.S. Constitution's Article 
1:8: 17-18, including its "internal" government 
organization's therein or by contract adhesioned thereto 
across America. And neither are millions of other such 
Citizens, unless they have provided "WAIVERS of 
Constitutional Rights" by "knowingly intelligent acts done 
with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and 
likely consequences" as ruled by the 1970 Supreme Court 
(Brady v. U.S., 397 U.S. 742 at 746). I have given no such 
"waivers". 
 
3. These studies also prove that a shrewd and criminal 
Constructive Fraud has been perpetrated upon America by 
government under counterfeit "color of law", through 
apparent entrapments of  certain ACTIVITIES (monopoly 
occupations) and PRIVILEGES" (other benefits) allowed by 
Statutory Acts or otherwise. By never-repealed American 
Law, such sources of past and present Criminal Element in 
(and behind) Government should be brought to Justice in a 
Constitutional Court for aiding and abetting this Fraud as 
willing Accomplices. It is for such Court with a 12-member 
Jury of Peers to decide who is and is not Guilty among 
personnel of government, media, schools, lawyers, 
accountants, clergy and other purveyors of misinformation 
and propaganda in this and related regards. 
 
4. Due to such shrewd entrapments, over the years I have 
unwittingly signed many of the related documents or 
contracts, some even under the "perjury" jurat as was 
supposedly required. With American Law on this Citizen's 
side, I hereby REVOKE all such signatures and render them 
null and void except for those that I choose to have 
measured as being under "TDC" (threat, duress and/or 
coercion) and/or "without prejudice" (per UCC 1-207), past 
and now. This is also my Lawful Notice that all such 
signatures of mine in the future, with such government or 
otherwise-adhesioned sources, are to be considered as under 
"TDC" and/or "without prejudice", whether appearing 
therewith or otherwise, including banks, licenses, etc. So be 
it, respectfully demanding that my Constitutional "Privileges 
and Immunities" (Article 4:2) are apart from 1:8:17-18's 
Washington, D.C., and shall not by Law be violated ever. 
 
5. With this accurate knowledge, I Lawfully "squarely 
challenge" the fraudulent usurping octopus of 
JURISDICTION/AUTHORITY (cited in Item #2 about) 
which does not apply to me (ref: Hagen v. Lavine {1974}, 
415 U.S. 528 at 533), with "the supreme Law of the Land" 
(our Constitution's 6:2) again on this Citizen's side. It is 
therefore now mandatory for any personnel of Article 
1:8:17-18's so-called "IRS", for example, to first prove its 
"jurisdiction" if any over me before any further procedures 
can take place in my regard [Title 5, U.S. Code, 856(d)]; or 
else its personnel and accomplices willfully violating this 
can and shall be personally charged as citizens under Title 
18 U.S. Criminal Codes 241, 242, 1001 and/or otherwise. In 
fairness it can be added that "IRS" agents have no written, 
Lawful "Delegation of Authority" to my knowledge and that 
their so-called "Form 1040" appears to be a bootleg 
document, lacking both a required OMB number and an 
expiration date. 
 
6. With all of the above in mind, it appears that this private 
Citizen is by Law as "Foreign" and "Non-Resident  Alien" 
to the Article 1:8: 17-18's Washington, D.C., as to another 
country and thus shall feel free to use its forms when and as 
useful (e.g. W-8 "Certificate of FOREIGN STATUS, 1040 
NR for "U.S. Non-Resident Alien Income Tax Return" 
Refunds, and IRS Code Section 402(n) to cancel 
"Withholding").

Mr. John LaFalce
111 W. Huron St.
Buffalo, NY  14202

Dear Mr. LaFalce,

Recently, I saw an article in the Buffalo News that detailed a
man's arrest; one of the charges being "possession of a noxious
substance" (CS gas).  This struck my curiousity (sic), so I went
to the New York State Penal Law.  Sure enough, section 270
prohibits possession of any noxious substance, and included in
section 265 is a ban on the use of "stun guns".  Now I am a male,
and fully capable of defending myself, but how about a female?

I strongly believe in a God-given right to self-defense.  Should
any other person or a governing body be able to tell a person that
he/she cannot save their own life, because it would be a violation
of the law?  In this case, which is more important: faced with a
rapist/murderer, would you pick a.) die, a law abiding citizen or
b.) live, and go to jail?

It is a lie if we tell ourselves that the police can protect us
everywhere, at all times.  I am in shock that a law exists which
denies a woman's right to self-defense.  Firearms restrictions are
bad enough, but now a woman can't even carry mace in her purse?!?!

/s/Tim McVeigh

(FBI) and have been so employed since 1976. I graduated from
California State University at Sacramento in 1972 with a BA Degree
in Criminal Justice and Southern Illinois University in 1976 with an
MS Degree in Political Science. From 1976 to 1988, I was assigned
to investigate a variety of federal criminal matters in both the FBI's
Portland and New York's offices. In 1988, I was assigned to the San
Francisco Division of the FBI as a Supervisory Special Agent (SSA)
of a Foreign Counterintelligence Squad, where I supervised a
number of sensitive Foreign Counterintelligence investigations. In
1994, I was re-assigned as the SSA for the UNABOM Task Force
(UTF) in San Francisco. My responsibilities included the
coordination of the efforts of the three agencies represented on the
UTF (FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and Postal
Inspection Service); the development of an integrated investigative
strategy to ensure the complete investigation of all UNABOM events
and the identification of potential suspects; and the supervision of
agent and support personnel assigned to the UNABOM Squad.

2. In 1995, I was designated the Assistant Special Agent in Charge
(ASAC) of San Francisco's National Foreign Intelligence Program,
to include continued management oversight of the UNABOM
investigation. As a result of a growing investigative effort, I was
designated as the ASAC in charge of the UNABOM Division of the
San Francisco office in July, 1995 In that position, I coordinate all
investigative efforts of the UNABOM investigation throughout the
United States.

3. This affidavit also relies upon the examinations and conclusions of
Thomas J. Mohnal who is presently a Supervisory Special Agent
(SSA) Examiner in the Explosives Unit of the FBI Laboratory,
Washington, D.C. SSA Mohnal graduated in 1979 from Lycoming
College in Williamsport, Pennsylvania with a BA degree in criminal
justice. In 1982, SSA Mohnal was employed as a Physical Science
Technician in the FBI Laboratory. In that year he successfully
completed the FBI's "Bombing Crime Scene School" at the FBI
Academy, Quantico, Virginia. He also graduated from the Basic
Demolition and Improvised Explosive Device School at the United
States Naval Explosive Ordinance Disposal Technology Center at
Indian Head, Maryland. In 1985 he was appointed as a Special Agent
of the FBI and received the basic training of a Special Agent. SSA
Mohnal was then assigned as an investigative agent to the Las Vegas
Division of the FBI until 1989, at which time he was returned to the
Explosives Unit at the FBI Lab. In 1989, he received additional
training by senior laboratory examiners within the FBI Lab. He
received instruction in the procedures and equipment utilized within
the Explosives Unit regarding laboratory examinations. In addition,
he became familiar with the reference literature dealing with
explosives, blasting accessories and explosive devices.

4. In 1990, SSA Mohnal graduated from the United States Army's
Hazardous Devices School in Huntsville, Alabama. The school is the
center of all training for "render safe" techniques to law enforcement
civilians. The school also provided detailed instruction with regard to
other areas of explosive matters, including recognition of commercial
and military explosives, improvised explosive devices, bomb
components and fusing systems. Since 1989, SSA Mohnal has
conducted thousands of examinations of items of evidence from
actual bombings and has conducted or assisted in numerous domestic
and international bomb scene investigations. SSA Mohnal continually
attends seminars and formal training programs on explosives and
pyrotechnics and visits explosive manufacturing facilities to observe
commercial and military explosive production and packaging
operations. He has lectured on crime scene investigations and
explosive technology at the FBI Academy and at other law
enforcement academies and bomb technician schools throughout the
country. He has testified in court and has been qualified as an expert
witness in the field of explosives and explosive devices.

5. The facts set forth in this affidavit are based upon the personal
observation and investigation of the Affiant, or upon the official
reports of other members of the Unabom Task Force or of the law
enforcement community. These reports include the following:
Reports of Interviews, Laboratory Reports, (including laboratory
analysis, diagrams, and charts), Expert Reports, Witness Statements,
Police Incident Reports, and Crime Scene Photographs.

6. This affidavit is submitted in support of a search warrant to obtain

INTRODUCTION

8. The investigation in this case concerns a series of bombings which
have occurred throughout the United States beginning with a
bombing on May 25, 1978 and continuing until the last known
bombing on April 24, 1995. In each of these bombings an improvised
explosive,
and/or incendiary device (referred to throughout this affidavit as an
explosive device) was used. During the course of this investigation,
members of the UNABOM Task Force, as well as experts in the field
of bomb construction and forensics, have identified significant
similarities in all these bombings, and have concluded that all of these
bombings have been carried out by the same individual or group of
individuals acting in concert. Similarities have been noted in the
construction of the explosive devices, in the methods of delivering
the destruction devices to the victims, in the locations of the
incidents, and in personal identification marks placed inside several
of the explosive devices.

9. As to the construction of the destructive devices, each was passive
(i.e. requiring some initiating action by the victim), the main
explosive charges were similar (i.e. smokeless powder, potassium
chlorate, ammonium nitrate, sodium chlorate, and aluminum
powder/flakes),
the fusing systems were similar (i.e. power sources, wiring
arrangements, switches, and initiator), and the housing for the
explosive devices were constructed of similar materials (i.e. wooden,
cardboard, or plastic boxes).

10. The explosive devices were delivered to the victim either by
physical placement or by the United States Postal Service. The
devices which were placed were put in areas of open access with
efforts meant to attract and deceive a potential victim. The mailed
devices had similar
packaging and similar efforts to falsely identify a return addressee,
usually listing a fictitious person or address.

11. The locations of the incidents are similar in that the devices were
mailed to or from, or placed in Chicago, Salt Lake City, Sacramento,
or the San Francisco Metropolitan Bay Area. Devices that exploded
in Connecticut, New Jersey and Tennessee were mailed from
Sacramento, San Francisco and Provo, Utah, respectively. A device
that was recovered in Washington had been mailed from Oakland,
California.

12. Eight (8) of the 16 devices bore a personal identification mark
consisting of the initials "FC" located either inside the devices or
contained in letters sent to the New York Times newspaper, which
accompanied the making of devices.

13. In a letter received by the New York Times on April 24, 1995,
the writer (who based on his use of a password and forensic analysis
we believed to have authored other UNABOM documents) claimed
credit for several devices, including the bomb that killed Thomas
Mosser on December 10, 1994, and individuals at universities who
have been "specialists in technical fields".

II

CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS

14. The following is a chronological description of the sixteen
bombing incidents which include an outline of the events prior to and
following the discovery of each of the explosive devices, a physical
description of each explosive device, and a list of the components of
each device recovered from the blast scenes.


A.

May 26, 1978 - Chicago, Illinois
(Explosive Device #1)

15. This device was contained in a parcel wrapped in brown paper
and was discovered unattended in the University of Illinois, Chicago
Campus, Engineering Building parking lot. The parcel was
addressed to Professor E.J. Smith at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
(RPI), Troy,
New York, with a return address of Professor Buckley Crist at
Northwestern University (NWU), Evanston, Illinois. The woman
who discovered the parcel contacted Northwestern University and
made arrangements to have the parcel returned to Crist. Upon
receiving the parcel, Crist became suspicious, since he had not
mailed any such parcel. He then  contacted the NWU, Department of
Public Safety. When the parcel was opened by a NWU Public Safety
officer, it exploded causing only minor injuries. The officer's injuries
were minor because the majority of the blast was directed to the side
away from the officer. However, an analysis of the components of
the explosive device by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms
(ATF) Laboratory concluded that this device was capable of causing
serious injury or death to persons in close proximity to the explosion.
Professor E.J. Smith, the intended recipient of the parcel, was
located and interviewed by ATF agents. He stated, as did Professor
Crist, that he had no knowledge of the parcel and no information
concerning who might have constructed the bomb.

16. An analysis of the components of the explosive device by the
ATF Laboratory revealed that it was constructed of a one inch
diameter galvanized pipe approximately nine inches in length sealed
on one end with a wooden plug. The explosive charge consisted of
two
types of smokeless powders and match heads. The pipe containing
the main charge, together with an improvised mechanical firing
mechanism consisting of a nail held under tension by multiple rubber
bands, was encased in a homemade wooden box. The cover of the
box was designed to release tension on the firing pin causing the nail
to strike the match heads, thus igniting the smokeless powder. 17.
The following components were recovered from the blast scene:

- Remnants of 1" pipe
- Wooden box
- Screws
- Nails
- Rubber bands
- Epoxy
- Two types of smokeless powder
- Match heads
- wood plug
- 3/4" black plastic tape
- 1/2" filament tape
- Brown wrapping paper
- "Eugene O'Neill" $1 U.S. postage stamps - Mailing label


B.

May 9, 1979 - Evanston, Illinois
(Explosive Device #2).

18. This device, contained in a "Phillies" brand cigar box, was
discovered on a table in room 2424 of the Technical Building of
Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois. At the time of the
explosion, Room 2424 was described as an area which was utilized
primarily by graduate students, faculty, and visiting scholars, and
was normally occupied by two teaching assistants. The device was
observed by students on the morning of May 9, 1979, but it was not
until mid-afternoon that John Harris, a member of the Civil
Engineering Department, opened the box. Upon opening the box, the
device exploded inflicting numerous lacerations and burns to Harris.

19. An analysis of the components of the explosive device by the
ATF laboratory revealed that the main charge explosives consisted of
match heads and a fusing system, consisting of two independent
circuits each of which could detonate the device. Each circuit
consisted of two C-cell batteries wired to two improvised wooden
dowel initiators. Each initiator contained a pair of wires routed
through a wooden dowel. The wires were joined at their termination
point by a thin bridge wire. The termination point was inside the
explosive main charge. When the box was opened, the electrical
circuit was completed, and the thin bridge wire was heated, thereby
igniting the mixture of smokeless powder and match heads. The
above materials were contained in a "Phillies" brand cigar box which
incorporated an anti-open switch designed to trigger the device upon
opening the box lid.

20. The following components were recovered from the blast scene:

- "Phillies" Cigar box
- Anti-open switch (wire loop switch)
- Smokeless powders
- Match heads
- Paper pouch (contained powder and match heads)
- C-cell batteries

C.

November 15. 1979 - Chicago, Illinois
(Explosive Device #3)

21. This device was contained in a parcel which was mailed from the
North Suburban postal facility which is located in the in Chicago;
Illinois area, on November 14, 1979. Investigators have not been
able
to determine the intended addressee of parcel, or the return address,
as a
result of the damage sustained by the parcel following detonation.
However,
because the parcel was routed by U.S. Postal employees to
Washington, D.C., aboard an American Airlines Boeing 727 the
address was believed to have been the Northeastern United States.
Shortly after takeoff, after the aircraft had reached the approximate
altitude of 34,500 feet, the flight crew experienced problems with the
aircraft which they described as a thump. Smoke subsequently filled
the cabin and the aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing.
It was later determined that the device had exploded in a mail
container located in the baggage compartment. Approximately
eighteen of the passengers were treated at the scene for smoke
inhalation. The baggage compartment of the aircraft and the items
inside were damaged by fire.

22. An analysis of the components of the explosive device by the
FBI Laboratory revealed that it was constructed from a large juice can
which housed an explosive main charge comprised of smokeless
powder and a variety of chemicals commonly utilized in the
manufacture of pyrotechnics, such as fireworks. The fuzing system
consisted of four C-cell batteries wired to a modified barometer
switch and a loop switch to two improvised wooden dowel initiators.
The device was contained in a homemade wooden box with a lid
hinged at the rear. The barometer switch was designed to initiate the
device as the aircraft gained altitude. The device also contained a
second fuzing system which was an anti-open switch which would
activate the device upon opening its lid.

23. The following components were recovered from the blast scene:

- Wooden box

D.

June 10, 1980 - Lake Forrest, Illinois
(Explosive Device #4)

24. A few days prior to June 10, 1980, Percy Wood, President of
United Airlines, received a type-written letter via U.S. Mail from an
Enoch W. Fischer. The letter was sent to Wood's residence in Lake
Forest, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. The letter stated that Fischer
was taking the liberty of sending, under separate cover, a book
which he indicated had great social significance. On June 9, 1980,
the parcel containing the device arrived at Wood's residence, but was
not opened by Wood until the afternoon of June 10, 1980. Wood
unwrapped the parcel which contained a book entitled "Ice Brothers"
written by Sloan Wilson. Upon opening the book, the device
exploded inflicting serious lacerations to Wood's face and upper left
leg. Subsequent investigation determined that the addressor, Enoch
W. Fischer, was a fictitious person.

25. An analysis of the components of the explosive device revealed
that it was constructed of a section of 3/4" diameter galvanized pipe
sealed on each end by a combination of nails and epoxy glue. The
explosive mixture contained within the pipe was comprised of three
types of smokeless powders. The fuzing system consisted of two D-
cell batteries, wired in series, through two improvised loop switches
to an unknown fusing system inside the pipe). The device was
contained within a hollowed out book titled "Ice Brothers" and was
designed to detonate upon opening. The device also contained a metal
tag with the letters "FC" stamped into it. This was the first incident in
which these initials were used.

(Explosive Device #5)

27. This device was contained in a large paper wrapped package and
was discovered in the third floor hallway of Bennion Hall Business
Building at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah. The
student who discovered the package brought it to the attention of a
staff member who notified the campus police. Prior to the police
arriving, a student tipped the package whereupon a stick slid out
from the bottom. The campus police chief examined the package and,
believing it was a bomb, contacted a local Explosive Ordinance
Demolition (EOD) team and requested that they respond to the
campus. Upon arrival, the EOD team X-Rayed the package and
determined that it was in fact a bomb. The device was then rendered
safe with a small explosive charge.

28. An analysis of the components of the explosive device conducted
by the FBI and Postal Service Laboratories revealed that it was
constructed from an 8" length of 1" diameter galvanized pipe sealed
on each end with wooden plugs. The explosive mixture contained
within the pipe was comprised of at least three types of smokeless
powders. The fuzing system consisted of two D-cell batteries, a
household on/off switch, an improvised slide switch, and an
improvised initiator, arranged in series. The device, which was
attached to a gasoline can, was designed to detonate upon lifting the
package approximately four inches, thus allowing the slide switch to
make contact. The device also contained a metal tag with the letters
"FC" stamped upon it.1 29. The following components were
recovered from the blast scene:

May 5, 1982 - Nashville, Tennessee
(Explosive Device #6)

30. This device was contained in a parcel which was addressed and
mailed to Professor Patrick C. Fischer at Pennsylvania State
University (PSU), with a return address of Professor LeRoy W.
Bearnson at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. The
parcel, which had been mailed from the BYU campus post office,
was subsequently forwarded by a secretary at PSU to Fischer at
Vanderbilt where he had been teaching for approximately two and
one half years. Fischer was out of the country at the time the parcel
arrived at Vanderbilt. Janet Smith, Fischer's secretary, opened the
parcel, which exploded inflicting serious injuries to her face and
arms. During an interview of Dr. LeRoy Bearnson, professor of
Electrical Engineering, he stated that he had no knowledge of any
such parcel.

31. An analysis of the components of the explosive device conducted
by the FBI and Postal Service Laboratories, revealed that it was
constructed from a 1-1/2" diameter household sink trap (U-shaped
pipe) sealed on either end with wood/metal plugs and nails. The
explosive mixture contained within the pipe was comprised of at least
five types of smokeless powders. The fuzing system consisted of
four D-cell batteries arranged in two independent circuits. Each
circuit was wired to include a loop switch and an improvised wooden
dowel initiator located inside the pipe. The device was contained in a
homemade wooden box which incorporated twin pivoting levers held
in tension by multiple rubber bands. The device was designed to
detonate upon removal of the outer package wrapping
which relieved pressure on the levers, thus closing the loop switches.
The device contained a metal tag stamped with the letters "FC". 32.

(Explosive Device #7)

33. This device was discovered by Professor Diogenes Angelakos in
Room 411 of the Cory Hall Mathematics Building on the University
of California, Berkeley campus. Angelakos observed the device
sitting on the floor and believed it to be some type of test device or
piece of equipment belonging to a student or a construction crew.
Upon lifting the handle, the device exploded inflicting serious
injuries to Angelakos' right hand, arm, and face.

34. An analysis of the components of the explosive device conducted
by the FBI Laboratory revealed that it was constructed from an 8-
1/2" length of 1/2" galvanized pipe sealed on either end with threaded
caps. The explosive main charge contained within the pipe was
comprised of at least four types of smokeless powders. The fuzing
system consisted of four D-cell batteries arranged in two independent
circuits. Each circuit was wired to include a loop switch attached to
each upright shaft of a handle, which was attached to a wooden box
and an improvised wood dowel initiator located inside the pipe. The
device consisted of a homemade wooden box which sat on top of a
gasoline can. The pipe was suspended in the gasoline can. This
device was designed to detonate upon lifting the handle. Incorporated
into this device was an ancillary component fashioned to resemble a
piece of test or measurement equipment. This component was placed
on top of the device and served no functional purpose in it's
operation as far as subsequent laboratory analysis has been able to
determine. Affixed to this ancillary component was a note bearing the
typed phrase "Wu--- It works! I told you it would. ---RV".

36. This device, in the form of a three-ring binder affixed to a plastic
file box, was discovered by Air Force Captain John Hauser, a
graduate student in the University of California Berkeley, Computer
Science Department. Hauser observed the device on a table located in
Room 264 of the Cory Hall Computer Science Building. Room 264
houses several computer terminals which are frequently used by
students in the department. Believing that it was another student's
project, Hauser attempted to lift the binder cover to view the
contents. Upon lifting the cover, the device exploded inflicting
serious injuries to Hauser's right hand including permanent nerve
damage and the loss of four fingers.

37. An analysis of the components of the explosive device conducted
by the FBI Laboratory revealed that it was constructed from a length
of 3/4" pipe sealed on either end by two plugs fabricated from metal
bar stock and secured with metal pins and cable. One of the metal
plugs had the letters "FC" stamped into its end. The explosive
mixture contained within the pipe was comprised of aluminum
powder and ammonium nitrate. The fuzing system consisted of six
D-cell batteries arranged in series to include an improvised loop
switch and a metal/wooden initiator located inside the pipe. The
device was housed in a plastic file box with wooden framework and
was designed to explode upon opening the lid.

I.

June 13, 1985 - Auburn, Washington
(Explosive Device #9)

39. This device was contained in a parcel, wrapped in brown paper,
which was addressed and mailed to the Boeing Aircraft Company,
Fabrication Division in Auburn, Washington, with a return address
of Weiburg Tool & Supply in Oakland, California. Subsequent
investigation revealed that the aforementioned company, listed on the
parcel's return address, was both a fictitious name and fictitious
address. The parcel, which had been mailed from Oakland
(postmarked May 8, 1985) was not addressed to a specific
individual, and therefore, remained in the company interoffice mail
until it was partially opened by mail room employees who discovered
the enclosed device. Boeing officials notified the King County
Sheriff's Bomb Squad, who subsequently rendered the device safe
by detonation.

40. An analysis of the components of the explosive device by the
FBI and U.S. Postal Service Laboratories revealed that it was
constructed from a 13-3/4" length of 1-1/4" diameter pipe. The pipe
was sealed on either end by two aluminum plugs and secured by steel
bars and epoxy glue. Both of the metal plugs had the initials "FC"
stamped into their ends. The explosive mixture contained within the
pipe was comprised of aluminum powder and potassium sulfate, a
combustion product of black powder. The fuzing system consisted of
eight D-cell batteries arranged in two independent four-cell circuits.
Each circuit included an improvised slide switch, both of which were
connected to a common improvised wood/metal initiator located
inside of the pipe. The entire device was encased in a homemade
wooden box. Each slide switch was mounted in a channel inside the
box and held in tension by a spring. The device was designed to
detonate upon removal of the wrapping paper which would open a
lever in the box allowing the slide switches to move to the closed
position.

42. This device was contained in a parcel which was mailed from
Salt Lake City, and was addressed to Dr. James V. McConnell at his
home in Ann Arbor, Michigan. At the time of this incident,
McConnell was a Professor of Psychology at the University of
Michigan. The return name and address marked on the parcel was
that of Ralph C. Kloppenburg, Department of History at the
University of Utah. Attached to the outside of the package was a
letter to McConnell, purportedly signed by Kloppenburg, requesting
that McConnell review and critique the enclosed manuscript. When
Nick Suino, an assistant to Dr. McConnell, opened one end of the
parcel, the device exploded inflicting injuries to Suino's arms and
abdomen and injuring McConnell's eardrum. Investigation
determined that the addressor, Ralph C. Kloppenburg, was a
fictitious person.

43. An analysis of the components of the explosive device conducted
by the FBI and Postal Service Laboratories revealed that it was
contained in a hollowed-out ream of paper, and was constructed from
a 10-1/4" length of 1" galvanized steel pipe. The pipe was sealed on
either end by two plugs fabricated from steel bar stock each being
secured by two steel pins with epoxy glue and shim material. One
end plug was stamped with the letters "FC". In addition to the end
construction, the pipe was reinforced on each end with short metal
sleeves fashioned from another piece of pipe having an outer
diameter of 1-5/16". The explosive mixture contained within the pipe
was comprised of aluminum powder and ammonium nitrate. The
fuzing system consisted of four D-cell and six AAA-cell batteries
arranged in two independent circuits. Each circuit was wired to a
spring- loaded triggering switch mechanism connected to a single
improvised initiator located inside of the pipe. The device was
designed to detonate upon unwrapping the parcel allowing tension to
be relieved on the switch.

44. The following components were recovered from the blast scene:

- Remnants of 1" galvanized steel pipe.
- 3/4" diameter metal end plugs (Letters "FC" stamped into end of
one plug)

K.

December 11, 1985 - Sacramento, California (Explosive Device #11)

45. This device was left outside the rear door of Rentech Computer
Rental Company in Sacramento, California. The device had the
appearance of a block of wood, with nails protruding at the ends.
Hugh Scrutton, the owner of Rentech, observed the device, and
attempted
to move or lift it. At that time the device exploded and killed
Scrutton.

46. An analysis of the components of the explosive device conducted
by the FBI Laboratory revealed that it was constructed from a 10"
length of 1" diameter steel pipe sleeved by a 1-1/4" diameter steel
pipe of the same length. Thin metal shim material was fitted between
the pipes, apparently to fill any remaining gap. The pipe assembly
was sealed on either end by two 1" diameter steel plugs each of
which were drilled to accommodate two steel securing pins. One of
the end plugs had the letters "FC" stamped into its surface. The
explosive mixture contained within the pipe was comprised of
aluminum powder and ammonium nitrate. The fuzing system
consisted of four D-cell batteries and one 9-volt battery. Each of the
D-cell batteries had electric wires soldered to the positive terminals.
The precise wiring of the device could not be determined due to the
extreme damage. However, it is believed that the device incorporated
some form of spring-loaded lever or anti-movement triggering
system wired to an improvised initiator located inside of the pipe.
This device was designed to detonate upon being moved.

47. The following components were recovered from the blast scene:

- Remnants of 1" and 1-1/4" pipe

February 20, 1987 - Salt Lake City, Utah (Explosive Device #12)

48. On the day of the bombing, an employee of a business in Salt
Lake City, Utah, observed, through the blinds of the rear office
window, an unidentified white male bending down next to the
witness's car. The employee observed the individual remove from a
cloth bag what appeared to be two 2x4 pieces of wood nailed
together with protruding nails and place the object near the front left
tire of the car. The witness then called to a co-worker in the office, at
which time the individual turned and looked up at the witness in the
window. The individual then stood up with the bag and walked away
through the parking lot leaving the device behind. Approximately an
hour later, Gary Wright, Vice-president of CAAMS, Inc., drove his
car into the rear parking lot and, after parking, noticed the device
laying on the ground. Upon moving, the device exploded inflicting
serious injuries to Wright.

49.  __  , was an employee of CAAMS, Inc., and provided UTF
investigators with a description of the individual who placed the
bombing device on February 20, 1987.  __  stated his face was
expressionless and  __  did not see his teeth or anything unusual
about his face.  __  advised there were no scars and marks on his
face, and he had a light strawberry blond colored mustache with no
other facial hair.  __   described his face as being thin, reddish flush,
rough looking complexion, but not with pock marks or other types of
deformities.  __  indicated __  overall impression of him was that he
looked healthy.

50.  __   described his hands as being white, more so than his face,
with long thin fingers and no hair on his hands that was noticed.  __

worked with the UTF and sketch artists in order to develop a
composite sketch, a recent composite drawing based on these
interviews is attached to this affidavit as attachment 1.

52. An analysis of the components of the explosive device conducted
by the FBI and ATF Laboratories revealed that it was constructed
from a three layer concentric assembly of 1" and 1-1/4" steel pipes
separated by a single layer of thin steel shim material. The pipe
assembly was sealed on both ends by plugs fabricated from 1" steel
bar stock, each secured with three metal pins and metal shim
material. One of the end plugs had the initials "FC" stamped into its
end. The explosive mixture contained within the pipe was comprised
of aluminum powder and ammonium nitrate. Also present was
potassium chloride and potassium sulfate. The fuzing system
consisted of four D-cell batteries arranged in a single circuit to
include an anti-lift or spring-loaded lever switch and an improvised

M.

June 22, 1993 - Tiburon, California
(Explosive Device #13)

54. This device was contained in a padded envelope and was mailed
to Dr. Charles Epstein at his residence in Tiburon, California. Dr.
Epstein was a professor at the University of California, San
Francisco, Medical School. The parcel was mailed from Sacramento,
California, with a return address listed as James Hill, Chemistry
Department, California State University, Sacramento, California. Mr.
Hill has been interviewed and has no knowledge of the parcel.
Shortly after noon on June 22, 1993, Epstein's daughter retrieved the
parcel from the mailbox and placed it on the kitchen counter. At
approximately 4:30pm that day, Dr. Epstein returned to his residence
and began to open his mail. Upon opening, the parcel exploded
inflicting serious injuries to Dr. Epstein.

55. An analysis of the components of the explosive device was
conducted by the FBI Laboratory and revealed that the device was
constructed from an approximately 6" length of 3/8" copper tubing
sealed on both ends by plugs comprising of metal, wood, and epoxy,
which were secured by 1/8" metal pins. The explosive material
contained within the tubing was comprised of a mixture of potassium
chlorate and aluminum powder. The fuzing system consisted of four
9-volt batteries, an improvised anti- open switch, and an improvised
initiator. The exact wiring of this device cannot be determined due to
the fragmented condition of the components. The device was housed

60. On June 24, 1993, Mr. Warren Hoge, Assistant Managing Editor
for the New York Times, received a letter from an individual or
individuals claiming to be an anarchist group calling themselves
"FC". The letter was mailed from Sacramento as were the explosive
devices sent to Dr. Epstein and Dr. Gelernter. The writer(s) noted in
the letter that the postmark on the letter preceded a newsworthy event
and indicated that the FBI was aware of their identities. The date on
the postmark preceded the detonation of the two explosive devices
sent to Drs. Epstein and Gelernter. The writer of the letter provided
"an identifying number that will ensure the authenticity of any future
communication from us...". The number, 553-25-4394, was
provided in a format similar to a Social Security Account Number.


P.

December 10. 1994 - North Caldwell, New Jersey (Explosive Device
#15)

61. This device was housed inside a homemade wooden box which
was placed inside a white cardboard box . The package was mailed
from San Francisco, California postmark dated 12/3/94 to the
residence of Thomas J. Mosser at 15 Aspen Drive, North Caldwell,
New Jersey. The package had a return address of H. C. Wickel,
Department of Economics, San Francisco State University, San
Francisco, California 94132. Subsequent investigation determined
that there was no faculty member or student at San Francisco State
University by that name, and no record of any such individual has
been located. On the morning of December 10, 1994, Mosser opened
the package, which exploded and killed him.

62. An analysis of the components of the destructive device
conducted by the FBI Laboratory revealed that the device was
constructed from a length of aluminum pipe (measuring at least 6-
1/2" in length but no longer than 9-1/2" and having an inside
diameter of 13/16", with a wall thickness of 1/16"). Both ends of the
aluminum pipe were sealed with metal end plugs having an outside
diameter of approximately 13/16" and a length 1-3/8". Each metal
plug was secured in place with two metal locking pins, 90 degree
opposing, measuring approximately 1-1/2" in length and having a
diameter of 1/4". A steel collar was placed over each end of the pipe
containing the end plugs and secured in place with the same locking
pins which cross through the end plugs. The explosive device was
housed in a homemade wooden box, secreted inside a white
cardboard box, aproximately 9-1/2" in length, by 7-1/4" in width, 2
1/4" in height. The white cardboard box had additional sections of
white cardboard
glued to the inside of the box to form a double wall thickness. The
construction of the wooden box was similar to the construction of the
wooden boxes utilized in devices 13 and 14. Double edged razor
blades and numerous paneling nails, approximately 1" in length,
were placed in the explosive device for additional shrapnel. It was
designed to function as an anti-personnel device. The explosive
mixture contained within the aluminum pipe was comprised of
sodium chlorate and aluminum. The fusing system consisted of four
9-volt batteries, an improvised anti-open switch (similar to a flip
switch design in devices 13 and 14), and an improvised initiator. The
exact nature of the switching mechanism and the wiring schematic
cannot be determined due to the fragmented condition of the
components. The device was designed to detonate upon opening.

Q.

Dr. David Gelernter Letter - April 24, 1995

64. On April 24, 1995, Dr. Gelernter, the victim of device number
14, received a letter from "FC". The letter was postmarked in
Oakland, California with the date of April 20, 1995, and was
addressed to Gelernter at the Department of Computer Science, Yale
University. The return address was "Ninth St. and Pennsylvania
Ave. NW Washington, DC 20535". This is the address of the F.B.I.
Headquarters building. The letter, which was opened by Gelernter's
assistant, states in part, that... "there are a lot of people out there who
resent bitterly the way "echo-nerds like you are changing the world
and you wouldn't have been dumb enough to open an unexpected
package from an unknown source". The letter continues,
discussing the contribution of computers to "invasion of
privacy,...genetic engineering,...(and) environmental degradation
through economic growth", "If there were no computer scientists
there
would be no progress in computer science". The letter states that
"Warren Hoge"
of the New York Times could confirm that the letter came from
"FC".


R.

Dr. Phillip A. Sharp Letter - April 24. 1995

65. On April 24, 1995, Dr. Phillip A. Sharp received a letter
addressed to him at the Biology Department, Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, Boston, Massachusetts. The letter had a postmark of
Oakland, California and was dated April 20, 1995. The contents of
the letter read as follows: "Dr. Sharp: It would be beneficial to your
health to stop your research in genetics. This is a warning from FC.
Warren Hoge of the New York Times can confirm that this note does
come from FC." The letter had a return address of Manfred Morari,
2735 Ardmore Road, San Marino, California 91108-1768. Morari
was interviewed by the UTF and stated he had no knowledge of the
letter.


S.

Dr. Richard J. Roberts Letter - April 24, 1995

66. On April 24, 1995, Dr. Richard J. Roberts received a letter
which had been addressed to him at New England Biolabs, Beverly,
Massachusetts 01915. The letter, with the exception of the addressee,
contained the same language as the letter to Dr. Sharp. The letter had
a postmark of Oakland, California and was dated April 20, 1995.


T.

New York Times Letter - April 24, 1995

67. On April 24, 1995, Mr. Warren Hoge, Assistant Managing
Editor for the New York Times, received a "message from FC" in a
letter form which also contained the number 553-25-4394, as did the
previous New York Times letter of June 24, 1993. The letter was
mailed from Oakland, California, as were the other letters dated April
20, 1995 to Gelernter, Sharp and Roberts. The letter discusses
several of the past devices and why victims Epstein, Gelernter, and
Mosser were selected by F.C.

68. According to this letter Thomas Mosser was selected "because he
was a Burston-Marsteller executive. Among other misdeeds,
Burston-Marsteller helped Exxon clean up its public image after the
Exxon Valdez incident". Individuals at universities who were
"attacked have
been specialists in technical fields", which included "certain areas of
applied psychology, such as behavior modification". The letter
explained that its author is a group of anarchists, whose goal is to
"break down all society into very small, completely autonomous
units...", ultimately resulting in the "destruction of the world
industrial system" through their bombings. The letter then discusses
the "group of anarchists" construction and evolutionary testing of the
devices. The result, according to the letter was the ability to "pack
deadly bombs into ever smaller, lighter and more harmless looking
packages. On the other hand, we believe we will be able to make
bombs much bigger than any we've made before". The letter then
proposes a "bargain", concerning the publication of an article,
29,000
to 37,000 words in length. The publication of the article, according
to the
"group's" conditions, would result in the termination of "terrorist
activities". However, the letter distinguishes "terrorism" from
"sabotage", in that terrorism is primarily directed against human
beings, while sabotage is against property. The letter stated "We
reserve the right to engage in sabotage".


U.
April 24, 1995 - Sacramento. California
(Explosive Device #16)

69. This device was housed inside a wooden box which was covered
with brown wrapping paper, bound by filament tape. The package
was mailed from Oakland, California, and was addressed to William
Dennison, Timber Association of California, 1311 I Street,
Sacramento, California. The Timber Association of California
however, had changed its name to the California Forestry
Association, several years earlier, but had retained the same
Sacramento address. The package had a return address of Closet
Dimensions, Oakland, California. On the afternoon April 24, 1995,
Gilbert B. Murray, President, California Forestry Association,
opened the package, which exploded and killed him.

70. An analysis of the components of the destructive device
conducted by the FBI Laboratory revealed that the device was
constructed from a unknown length of lead pipe. The pipe had been
intentionally scored to increase the potential of smaller shrapnel
fragments. The explosive device was housed in a wooden box,
covered with brown wrapping paper, secured by 3/4" filament tape.
Two cast aluminum disks, approximately 3 1/2" in diameter, and
approximately 7/16" thick, were also recovered. These disks appear
to be of a "homemade" origin, containing numerous steel wires,
believed to have been used for reinforcement purposes. The
construction of the wooden box was similar to the wooden boxes
utilized in devices 13, 14, and 15. Contained in the device was an
undetermined length of approximately 3/8" copper tubing, which had
an approximate wall thickness of .030". One end of the tube was
sealed by a metal plug, secured in place by an approximate 1/8" metal
pin. A partial closure plug for the opposing end was approximately
3/8" in diameter, and 3/8" in length. This plug exhibited two hole
passing through the axis, which could have been used to contain the
hot wire igniter. The construction of the copper tube and end plug is
similar in construction to the copper tubing used in devices 13 and
14. The explosive mixture contained within the lead pipe was
comprised of potassium chlorate and aluminum powder. The fuzing
system consisted of at least four 9-volt batteries. The exact nature of
the switching mechanism and the wiring schematic cannot be
determined due to the fragmented condition of the components.

71. The following components were recovered from the blast scene:

- Lead pipe fragments

New York Times Letter - June 2d, 1995

73. On June 28, 1995, Mr. Warren Hoge, Assistant Managing Editor
for the New York Times, received a "message from FC", which
supplied the identifying number, 553-25-4394. The envelope had a
postmark of San Francisco, California, which was dated June 24,
1995. The letter had a return address of Calgene Inc., 1920 5th
Street, Davis, California 95616. Enclosed with the message was a
"manuscript" of approximately 65 pages, which "FC" wished to have
published, as had been previously stated in the April 24, 1995 letter
to Hoge. The message then continued to set forth various terms and
conditions as to the rights of the publisher who prints the manuscript.
The last paragraph of the message stated "We have no regret about
the fact that our bomb blew up the 'wrong' man, Gilbert Murray,
instead of William N. Dennison, to whom it was addressed".


X.

Washington Post Letter - June 24, 1995

74. On June 27, 1995, Mr. Michael Getler, Deputy Managing Editor,
Washington Post received a "message from the terrorist group FC".
The envelope had a postmark of San Francisco, California, which
was dated June 24, 1995. The letter had a return address    ___   The
message then mentions the group's "bombing at the California
Forestry Association", and its "offer to desist from terrorism if a
manuscript" were published according to their terms. Enclosed with
the message was a carbon copy of the same "manuscript" sent to the
Mr. Hoge at the New York Times, on June 24, 1995, along with a
copy of the message also sent to the New York Times. The
Washington Post message also sets forth various terms for
publication, and offers the New York Times as a source for
authenticating the communication.


Y.

Penthouse Magazine Letter - June 24, 1995

75. On June 29, 1995, Mr. Bob Guccione, Penthouse Magazine,
received a "message from FC" in letter form. The envelope had a
postmark of San Francisco, California, which was dated June 24,
1995. The letter had a return address   ___  The letter to an earlier
offer by
Penthouse to publish a manuscript from FC in exchange for the
group's "promise
to desist from terrorism". The letter also stated that authentication of
the communication could be made through contact with the New
York Times, as it was familiar with the "secret identifying number,
which is known only to the New York Times and the FBI". Enclosed
with the Penthouse letter was a copy of the same message and
manuscript sent to the New York Times. The letter to Penthouse then
mentioned the terms and conditions for the manuscript's publication
in Penthouse but stated a preference for publication in the New York
Times or the Washington Post. The letter further stated as an
"incentive" for the New York Times or another "respectable"
periodical to publish the manuscript, the group states "if our
manuscript is published in Penthouse, and is not published and
distributed through 'respectable' channels" the group would desist
permanently from terrorism, but that it would "reserve the right to
plant one (and only one) bomb, intended to kill, AFTER our
manuscript has been published".

76. The Guccione/Penthouse letter then references and discusses
excerpts from an unknown 1985 letter, allegedly sent by the group to
the "Examiner". It also stated that FC stands for "Freedom Club".
The alleged letter took responsibility for Devices 7 and 8, at the
University of California, Berkeley, Device 6 at Vanderbilt
University, and Device 5 at the University of Utah, "among others".
The remainder of the Penthouse message contains other alleged
excerpts from the 1985 letter which further describes the goals and
objectives of Freedom Club.

page letter referencing an article, by Russell Ruthen, "Strange
Matters: Can Advanced Accelerators Initiate Runaway Reaction ?",
from August, 1993 magazine publication. The letter then proceeds to
discuss technical advances by scientists and other entities, and the
negative aspects of these developments on society. In the last two
paragraphs of the letter, the author is identified as "the terrorist group
FC", and quotes paragraph four of the New York Times letter dated
June 24, 1995, for purposes of authentication . The envelope was
not retained by the recipient.

Dr. Tom Tyler Letter - June 24, 1995

78. On June 30, 1995, Dr. Tom Tyler, Social Psychology Group,
University of California, Berkeley, received a "message from FC" in
letter form. The envelope had a postmark of San Francisco,
California, which was dated June 24, 1995. The letter had a return
address   ___  The letter referenced "a newspaper article" in which
Dr. Tyler commented on "recent bombing, including ours". Enclosed
was a carbon copy of the same manuscript which had been sent to the
New York Times, Washington Post, and Penthouse Magazine. The
letter discusses the rational and irrational components of human
behavior and posed several questions to Dr. Tyler
concerning technology, the future, and its effect on the human race.

COMMONALITIES AND SIMILARITIES PERTAINING TO THE
EXPLOSIVE DEVICES AND THE INCIDENTS

79. The commonalities and the similarities between the incidents and
the 16 explosive devices demonstrate that the individual(s) who
constructed the devices acted in a continual and consistent pattern of
activity from the time of the first bomb in 1978 until the present day.
The following paragraphs list these commonalities and similarities.

80. Explosive Device Construction - All of the devices have been
characterized as "passive" in that they were designed to function
upon some action by the victim/target. All of the devices were
designed with an element of deception to solicit the interaction of the
victim.

81. Explosive Main Charges - The main charges in devices 1 through
7 are similar in that each was comprised primarily of a variety of
smokeless powders supplemented in some incidents by match heads.
The main charges present in devices 8 through 12 were comprised of
similar mixtures of aluminum and ammonium nitrate powders. The
main charges present in devices 13, 14 and 16 was comprised of
similar mixtures of potassium chlorate and aluminum powders. The
main charge present in device 15 was comprised of a mixture of
sodium chlorate and aluminum.

82. Main Charge Housings - The main charge housing in all of the
explosive devices, with the exception of devices 2 and 3, consisted
of a length of metallic pipe. The construction exhibited in devices 11
and 12 are nearly identical in that each consisted of a three layer
concentric assembly of 1" and 1-1/4" steel pipes separated by a thin
steel shim and closed on each end by 1" diameter steel plugs. The
lengths of 1-1/4" steel pipe for these two devices are consistent with
having originally been one contiguous piece. The lengths of 1" steel
pipe and the thin steel shim material placed between the two pipes
also could have originated from the same stock. Devices 8 and 10 are
similar in that each incorporated a 1-1/4" diameter collars around each
end of the 3/4" pipe. Both pipes were closed on each
end by a 3/4" steel plug. All of the end plugs in devices 8, 10, 11,
and 12 were secured by 5/16" diameter pins. Devices 8, 10 and 11
are similar in that the ends of the securing pins displayed small tick
marks. Device 15 is similar to devices 8 and 10 in that it incorporated
a metal collar over each end of the main charge tube. Device 15 also
utilized metal end plugs, similar to devices 8, 10, 11, and 12, which
were secured in place by 1/4" metal locking pins, 1-1/2 " in length.
The main charge housings in devices 13 and 14 are nearly identical in
construction. Both incorporated an approximately six inch length of
3/8" copper tubing sealed on one end by wooden dowel end plug and
secured by a 1/8" pin. The other end of the tubing was sealed with a
metal plug and secured by a 1/8" metal pin. The wooden end plug in
each device was hollowed out and filled with epoxy adhesive to
allow the passage and securing of twin initiator wires. Attached to the
ends
of both copper tubes were metal disks which served as a mount to
each wooden box. Part of the initiation system in device 16 consisted
of a copper tube construction with metal end plugs pinned in place
with 1/8" pins, which was similar to the main charge housings in
devices 13 and 14.

83. Fusing Systems - All of the devices with the exception of the first
device employed similarly constructed electrical fusing systems. Each
of these devices included a power source, similar wiring
arrangements, a switch, and an initiator. The power sources in
devices 2 through 12 are similar in that they consisted of varying
numbers of batteries joined together by soldering wires to their
respective terminals. The use of D-cell batteries was common to
devices 4 through 12. The power sources in devices 13, 14, 15 and
16 are identical in that they each consisted of at least four nine volt
batteries. The removal of the outer battery casings was observed in
devices 11 through 16. Soldering was used to connect the
wiring to the battery terminals. All devices, except for 1 and 7,
exhibited soldering in excess of that needed to perform the task.
Common in the wiring of each of these devices was the use of
separated, multi-strand duplex wire normally encountered in
household appliances. The improvised loop switches observed in
devices 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and
8 are extremely unusual and exhibit nearly identical construction
techniques. With the exception of device 3, all of the loop switches
were constructed from separated, duplex multi-strand wire. The
insulation on the wires in devices 11 and 12 bear the same extrusion
marks and, therefore, were made on the same machine. The brown
stranded wire used in devices 8 through 12 has the same physical
characteristics and many lengths bear the marking, SPT-2 E-11981,
thus possibly
having been obtained from the same source. Devices 13, 14 and 15
incorporated a type of improvised flip switch. The improvised
initiators present in devices 2, 3, and 5 through 8 were assembled in
a similar fashion and consisted of a wooden dowel, a pair of wires,
and a bridgewire. The initiator assemblies present in devices 9
through 15 are similar to devices 5 through 8 in that they were
designed to accommodate a pair of initiator wires in a similar
arrangement. Devices 10, 11, and 12 utilized red insulated, multi-
strand wire for the initiator wires.

84. Tape - All of the explosive devices are similar in that each
contained numerous types of tape used in the assembly and
packaging of the device. Present in all of the devices was 3/4" black
plastic tape.

85. Wooden Box/Frame Construction - With the exception of device
2, all of the devices incorporated some form of a wooden box or
frame, hand-fashioned and fabricated from a variety of wood types
utilizing various types of nails, screws and other fasteners. Devices
11 and 12 exhibited nearly identical construction in that both were
fabricated from a piece of construction lumber with nails protruding
from one side giving each the appearance of a hazard. This
disguising technique is also evident in devices 5, 7, and 8, where the
devices were constructed to give the appearance of something that
would invite attention. The box construction exhibited in devices 13
and 14 were nearly identical. Each of these devices were fabricated
from 1/4" wood and had external dimensions of approximately 8" x
4" x 1-1/2".

86. Letters "FC" - These letters are associated with all of the devices
with the exception of 1, and 2. Metal tags approximately 1/2" to 5/8"
wide bearing the stamped letters "FC" were recovered from devices
4, 5, and 6. Devices 8 through 12 revealed the same stamped letters
on the main charge housing end plugs. The letters "FC" were directly
associated with devices 5, 13, 14, and 15, in the letter to the New
York Times, postmarked April 20, 1995; devices 3, 6, and 16, in the
letter to the New York Times, postmarked June 24, 1995; devices 5,
6, 7, 8, and 11, in the letter to Penthouse Magazine, postmarked
June 24, 1995; and device 16, in the letter to Scientific American,
received in June, 1995.

87. Typewriter impressions - Qualified document examiners have
conducted comparisons of the typewriter impressions appearing on
documentary evidence recovered from Device 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14,
and 15. They have also compared the typed letters sent to Dr. David
Gelernter, Dr. Phillip A. Sharp, Dr. Richard J. Roberts, Dr. Tom
Tyler, the San Francisco Chronicle, Scientific American, Penthouse
Magazine, Washington Post and the New York Times, dated June
24, 1993 and April 24, 1995. They have concluded the same
typewriter was used to type all these documents. No typewriter
impressions were recovered from the crime scene of device 16, due
to a small fire which occurred after the device detonated.

88. Stapler - Tool Marks - Qualified examiners have conducted
comparisons of the various staples used in devices 13, device 14,
and the letters sent to the New York Times, postmarked June 25,
1995, Penthouse Magazine, postmarked June 24, 1995. They have
concluded that unique marks left upon some of the staples are
identical. The following staples had identical tool marks: three of the
staples removed from the New York Times letter, one of the staples
from the Penthouse letter, two of the staples from device 13, and one
of the staples from device 14.

89. Victims - Most of the victims, or intended victims, fall into four
categories: (1) airline-related, (2) university-related, (3) computer-
related, and (4) Public Relations. Some of the victims fall into more
than one category. Airline-related victims are in devices 3, 4, and 9.
University-related victims are in devices 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, and
14. Computer-related victims are in devices 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, and
14. The victims in devices 15 and 16 were employed in businesses
which dealt with public relations issues.

90. Misleading Return Address - Nine devices were mailed and one
device was placed near a business to appear as a mailed or delivered
item. Of these ten devices, at least nine utilized deceptive or
misleading return addressers and addressees, as opposed to no return
address. Devices 4, 9, 10, and 15, utilized fictitious return
addressers. Devices 1, 6, 13, 14, and 16 utilized actual persons or
businesses as return addressers; however, these entities had no
known connection to the mailings. Device 3 was mailed; however,
due to the extreme damage caused to the parcel, no addresses could
be discerned.

91. "Priority Mail" Stamp - The use of the "Priority Mail" stamp on
the outer parcel wrapping was observed in devices 6, 10, 13, 14, 15
and 16.

92. United States Postal Stamps - All of the ten mailed devices
utilized United  States postage stamps, as opposed to having a
postage metering strip. Nine different types of stamps, in varying
combinations, appeared on the ten different devices. Four different
stamps depicting the United States Flag were used. The first was a
29 cent, U.S. Flag with the Olympic Rings, which was first issued
in April 1991. This stamp appeared on devices 13, 14 and the letter
to the New York Times, dated June 24, 1993. The second stamp
depicts the U.S. Flag in front of the United States Capitol. This 22
cent stamp was first issued in March 1985, and appeared on devices
9, 10, and 15. The third stamp has the U.S. Flag with a background
setting of clouds. This stamp was first issued in May 1988, and
appeared on device 15. The fourth U.S. Flag stamp, was the 32 cent
"Old Glory" G Series. It was used on device 16, and the letters sent
to Dr. David Gelernter, Dr. Phillip A. Sharp, Dr. Richard J. Roberts,
and the New York Times (April 24, 1995) . The "Old Glory" G
Series 32 cent stamp was also used on the packages and letters sent
to
the San Francisco Chronicle, New York Times, Washington Post,
Penthouse Magazine, and Dr. Tom Tyler, all of which were
postmarked June 24, 1995. The envelope from the Scientific
American letter was not retained by the recipient. Three of the device
stamps used were from the Prominent Americans series, to include the
Eugene O'Neill, Lucy Stone, and
Frederick Douglass stamps. The $1.00 O'Neill stamp, in sheet
version, was first issued in October 1967 and appeared on devices 1,
3 and 6. The $1.00 O'Neill stamp, in roll version, was first issued in
January 1978 and appeared on device 15 and 16. The 50 cent Lucy
Stone stamp was first issued August of 1968 and appeared on device
3. The 25 cent Frederick Douglass stamp was first issued in
February 1967 and appeared on devices 3 and 4. The
last two stamps were a 15 cent Will Rogers, from the Performing
Arts and Artists Series, and a $1.00 Rush Lamp and Candleholder,
also known as "America's light fueled by truth and reason". The Will
Rogers stamp was first issued in November 1979 and was used on
device 4. The Rush Lamp and Candleholder was first issued in July
1979 and appeared on devices 3, 4 , 9 and 10. Device 16 also had $
2.90 stamps affixed to the face of the package. The type of exact type
of stamp is unknown, and is believed to have been consumed in a
small fire that resulted after the device detonated.

93. Geographic Areas of Incidents and Mailings - Several devices are
related to the Chicago, Illinois area. Devices 1 and 2 were placed at
universities in the Chicago metro area. Devices 3 and 4 were mailed
from the Chicago metro area. The victim of device 4 resided in Lake
Forest, a suburb of Chicago. Other devices are associated with the
Salt Lake City/Provo, Utah, area. Devices 5 and 12 were placed in
Salt Lake City. Devices 6 and 10 were mailed from the Salt Lake
City/Provo area. Seven devices are associated with the Northern
California area. Devices 7 and 8 were placed in Berkeley, California.
Device 11 was placed in Sacramento, California, and devices 13, 14
and the New York Times letter dated June 24, 1993, were mailed
from that area. Device 13 was mailed to the victim who resided in
Tiburon, a suburb of San Francisco. Device 15 was mailed from San
Francisco, California to the victim who resided in North Caldwell,
New Jersey. The packages and letters sent on June
24, 1995, to the San Francisco Chronicle, New York Times,
Washington Post, Penthouse Magazine, and Dr. Tom Tyler, were all
postmarked San Francisco, California. Device 16 was mailed in
Oakland, California to a victim in Sacramento, California. The letters
sent to Dr. David Gelernter, Dr. Phillip A. Sharp, Dr. Richard J.
Roberts, and the New York Times dated April 24, 1995, were all
postmarked in Oakland,  California.

94. Mailing Labels - Eight of the devices were packaged with pre-
printed mailing labels affixed to the outside. Devices 1, 4, and 6 had
identical labels believed to be manufactured by Dennison. Devices 9
and 10 had identical labels from an unknown source. Device 15 had
the same type of mailing label consistent with device 9 and 10, with
the exception that the lower portion of the device 15 label has been
removed along the manufacturers prescored line. Devices 13, and 14
had identical appearing labels, believed to be manufactured by
Quikstik.


IV

STATEMENT OF PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THEODORE JOHN
KACZYNSKI'S CONNECTION TO UNABOM EVENTS AND
FOR THE SEARCH OF HIS RESIDENCE

A. Identity

95. Beginning on February 14, 1996, David Kaczynski informed
members of the UNABOM Task Force (UTF) that he believes his
brother Theodore John Kaczynski, also known as "Ted", to be the
person responsible for the UNABOM event. David Kaczynski
initiated contact with the FBI through an attorney. He stated that he
did not want any of the reward money offered in connection with this
investigation.

96. Investigation by the UTF has revealed that Theodore John
Kaczynski is a white male, 5'9", 150 pounds, with a date of birth of
May 22, 1942. He has a Montana driver's license #342-34-3701
with a listed address as HCR 30, Lincoln, Montana and a mailing
address of P.O. Box 524, Lincoln, Montana.

97. A warranty deed dated June 19, 1971 in the County of Lewis and
Clark, State of Montana indicates that Clifford Gehring, Sr. sold a
1.4 acre parcel of land with the right of ingress and egress from
Stemple Pass to Theodore John Kaczynski and his brother David R.
Kaczynski. The property was more particularly described as four
miles south of Lincoln, Montana, 1/4 mile east of Stemple Pass Road
on Canyon Creek.


B. DNA

98. A postage stamp obtained from the envelope used to mail a copy
of the FC manuscript to Dr. Tom Tyler was subjected to DNA
analysis by the FBI Laboratory-DNA Section. The results of that
analysis were compared to results obtained from the postage stamp
and envelope flap of a letter sent by Theodore Kaczynski to his
brother David Kaczynski. Based upon the analysis of the DQ alpha
(DQA1) and the Polymarker (PM) Loci, the source of the DNA on
the known sample (Theodore Kaczynski's letter to Dave Kaczynski)
is included as a potential contributor to the DNA detected on the
stamp from the letter received by Dr. Tyler.

99. The estimated probability expressed as a percentage of selecting
an unrelated individual at random from the population having DQA1
type 1.1,2 as detected in these specimens, is approximately 3 percent
of Caucasians, 3 percent of Blacks, and 5 percent of Southeastern
Hispanics and 2 percent of Southwestern Hispanics.

100. It is noted by your affiant that at least one of the victims
previously mentioned and another suspect in the UNABOM
investigation (whose identity is known to the UTF) have shared the
same DNA Polymarker as Theodore Kaczynski. Because
employment records for this person conflicted with known UNABOM
events, UTF
investigation eliminated this individual as a UNABOM subject.


C. Background

101. Theodore Kaczynski's brother, David Kaczynski, has informed
UTF investigators that he developed a suspicion of Theodore
Kaczynski's (hereafter referred to as Theodore Kaczynski, or as
David Kaczynski's brother if appropriate) involvement in the series
of bombings committed by the UNABOM subject after reading news
media reports, in approximately December, 1994, that summarized
the dates and places of the UNABOM events and bombings.

102. David Kaczynski informed the UTF that he and his brother
grew up in Chicago, Illinois (the locale of the first four bombings);
his brother had obtained his doctorate from the University of
Michigan (the location of a mail bomb victim targeted by the
UNABOM subject); his brother had taught at the University of
California at Berkeley (the site of two UNABOM bombings); and his
brother had lived and worked in Salt Lake City, Utah (the location of
several UNABOM events.)

103. Independent investigation conducted by the UTF revealed that
Theodore Kaczynski graduated from Evergreen Park High School in
Evergreen Park, Illinois. He also attended Harvard University from
1958-1962, where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1962.
Theodore Kaczynski attended the University of Michigan at Ann
Arbor, Michigan from 1963-1967, where he earned both his master's
and doctorate.

104. Independent investigation conducted has further revealed that
Theodore Kaczynski was employed as an Assistant Professor of
Mathematics from July 16, 1967 through June 30, 1969 at the
University of California, Berkeley (UCB).

105. David Kaczynski has advised investigators that following his
reading of published excerpts from the UNABOM manuscript in
approximately August, 1995, he became increasingly suspicious of
strong similarities between Theodore Kaczynski's views and those of
the UNABOM subject. He further stated that upon reading the
published UNABOM manuscript in its entirety, in approximately
September, 1995, he became convinced that his brother was the
author of the UNABOM manuscript. In particular, David Kaczynski
stated that there was a unique phrase in the UNABOM manuscript,
which referred to a "cool-headed logician" which he, David
Kaczynski, recognized as his brother's terminology. David
Kaczynski stated that this and other statements in the UNABOM
manuscript "leapt out" at him because they expressed his brother,
Theodore Kaczynski's, long-held position on the role of art versus
science in our society. According to David Kaczynski, these
statements marked the UNABOM manuscript as his brother's
product, because he and his brother had a running argument for years
on these
topic.

106. David Kaczynski advised investigators that he recognized, in
particular, a paragraph in the first portion of the manuscript that
spoke of art and the human experience. Paragraph 17 of the
UNABOM manuscript (attachment 2) discusses art and rationality.

107. David emphasized that his brother has long been committed to
"rationality" as a guiding principle. He further stated that since his
brother's ideas were based on a "rational ideal", any action in support
of them was justifiable. David Kaczynski expressed his sadness to
investigators in commenting that this type of justification would
enable his brother to feel fully justified and even visionary in killing
people to accomplish his "rational objectives."


D. A Comparative Analysis: Theodore Kaczynski's Essay and
Letters and the UNABOM Manuscript

108. In addition to providing 86 personal letters received from
Theodore Kaczynski during the preceding 30 years, David
Kaczynski provided investigators with a photocopy of a carbon copy
of an essay written by his brother in approximately 1971 (a copy of
this essay and incorporated by reference to this affidavit in attachment
number 3). In
that essay his brother, Theodore Kaczynski, discusses the necessity
of forming and supporting an organization to bring about the end of
Federal and corporate funding for scientific research. David
Kaczynski has advised the UTF that his brother personally discussed
with him in approximately 1971 the possibility of David heading up
such an organization. David stated that he recognized substantial
similarity between the ideas, concepts and expressions contained in
his brother's 23 page essay and the UNABOM manuscript.

109. On March 23, 1996, Wanda Kaczynski, Theodore and David
Kaczynski's mother, provided UTF members with a carbon copy of
the essay bearing handwritten notations identified by David as
Theodore Kaczynski's handwriting.

110. The affiant has consulted with and reviewed the findings of FBI
Supervisory Special Agent James R. Fitzgerald, who has directed the
comparative analysis of all of Theodore Kaczynski's correspondence
and documentation in a side-by-side comparison of the UNABOM
letters and 56 page manuscript entitled Industrial Society and Its
Future. Through this study SSA Fitzgerald has informed the affiant
that the content, context and writing style of Theodore Kaczynski's
6,374 word, 23-page, essay (attachment 3) and the 34,649 word
UNABOM manuscript (attachment 2) are very similar. Some of those
similarities are as follows:

111. One of the 47 paragraphs in the 1971 essay, 35 of the
paragraphs can be correlated by subject matter with paragraphs in the
UNABOM manuscript.

112. The comparative analysis provides over 160 examples of
similarities including the following:

Theodore Kaczynski wrote in his 1971 essay (see attachment 3)
regarding his objection to Perry London's view in his book Behavior
Control, "I simply find the sphere of freedom that he favors too
narrow for me to accept." The UNABOM manuscript states in
paragraph 93, "We are going to argue that industrial-technological
society cannot be reformed in such a way as to prevent it from
progressively narrowing the sphere of human freedom...." In
paragraphs 111, 128 and 133, the UNABOM manuscript contains
references to "...narrowing our sphere of ...freedom....narrows our
sphere of freedom.....invades our sphere of freedom...."

In Theodore Kaczynski's 1971 essay, he states: "Direct physical
control of the emotions via electrodes and 'chemitrodes' inserted in
the brain." Paragraph 158 of the UNABOM manuscript states: "It
presumably would be impractical for all people to have electrodes
inserted in their heads."

In Theodore Kaczynski's 1971 essay, he states: "Various electronic
devices for surveillance. These are being used. For example,
according to newspaper reports, the police of New York City have
recently instituted a system of 24 hour television surveillance over
certain problem areas of the city." Paragraph 147 of the UNABOM
manuscript states: "...there are the techniques of surveillance. Hidden
videocameras are now used to collect and process vast amounts of
information."

In Theodore Kaczynski's 1971 essay, he states: "...Think of all the
misery suffered as a result of Victorian repressions, sexual
perversions, frigidity, unwanted pregnancies, and venereal disease."
Note two of the UNABOM manuscript reads: "During the Victorian
period many oversocialized people suffered from serious
psychological problems
as a result of repressing or trying to repress their sexual feelings."

In Theodore Kaczynski's 1971 essay, he states: "Propaganda and
image-making techniques. In this context we must not neglect the
role of movies, television, literature, which commonly are regarded
either as art or as entertainment, but which often consciously adopt
certain points of view and thus serve as propaganda." Paragraph 73
of the UNABOM manuscript states: "...Propaganda is not limited to
'commercials' and advertisements...the content of entertainment
programming is a powerful form of propaganda."

In Theodore Kaczynski's 1971 essay, he states: "...we can assume
that people will live more and more in the world of mass
entertainment." Paragraph 156 of the UNABOM manuscript states:
"...yet mass entertainment is a means of escape and stress-reduction
on which most of us have become dependent."

113. There are additional similarities between the writing of
Theodore Kaczynski and documents related to the UNABOM events.
In a handwritten and undated rough draft written by Theodore
Kaczynski provided to the UTF by Wanda Kaczynski on March 23,
1996, Theodore Kaczynski states: "...Modern technology has led to
the concentration of economic and political power...by Big Business
and Big Government." In note 13 of the UNABOM manuscript, the
UNABOM subject states: "...The conservatives are...exploiting his
resentment of Big Government to promote the power of Big
Business."

114. Other examples of similarities include the same uncommon (and
in the last case inaccurate) spellings of words used in both categories
of documents, such as "analyse" versus "analyze"; "wilfully" instead
of "willfully"; licence instead of license and "instalment" rather than
"installment."

115. A summary of similarities between documents associated with
Theodore Kaczynski and documents associated with UNABOM
events is contained in attachment 4 to this affidavit. Attachment 4 was
prepared by SSA Fitzgerald in this investigation.

116. Many letters written by Theodore Kaczynski to his brother
David and mother Wanda discussed his wilderness lifestyle. These
discussions of Theodore Kaczynski's lifestyle are consistent with the
description of Theodore Kaczynski's lifestyle provided to the UTF
by David and Wanda Kaczynski, as well as   ___  These discussions
of Theodore Kaczynski's lifestyle are also consistent with reference
to the UNABOM manuscript.

117. The following are examples:

In a letter to David Kaczynski dated August 28, 1979, Theodore
Kaczynski says: "....by wilderness I meant a place where our nearest
neighbor would be 5 miles away..." In paragraph 55 the UNABOM
manuscript says: "many nuclear families lived by choice in such
isolation; having no neighbors within several miles.

In a letter to David dated November 17, 1982, Theodore Kaczynski
says: "...partial destruction of the ozone layer in the atmosphere,
which is caused by releases of fluorcarbons..." and in a letter dated
September 21, 1988, says: "They predict that in the coming years
there will be
increasing more drought... because of the greenhouse effect."
Paragraph 169 of the UNABOM manuscript says, "No one knows
what will happen as a result of ozone depletion, the greenhouse effect
and other environmental problems..."

In a letter to  ___  dated July 23, 1984, Theodore Kaczynski writes,
"...primitive people...may have had some elaborate process for
making edible, as with certain other plants." Theodore Kaczynski
refers to the "edibility of the roots" in several letters. Paragraph 198
of the UNABOM manuscript says, "When primitive man needed
food he knew how to find and prepare edible roots...

In a letter to David dated August 21, 1981 Theodore Kaczynski
writes, "...hunting and gathering wild fruits... killing an animal for
its meat." In paragraph 75 of the UNABOM manuscript, "...hunting
not for sport...but to get meat that is necessary for food."


E. Further Comparative Analysis Between UNABOM Manuscript
and Theodore Kaczynski's Letters

118. The UNABOM manuscript (attachment 2) specifically refers by
title to four books: The Ancient Engineers by L. Sprague DeCamp;
Chinese Political Thought in the Twentieth Century, by Chester D.
Tan; The True Believer, by Eric Hoffer; and Violence in America:
Historical and Comparative Perspectives, by Roger Lane and edited
by Hugh Davies Graham and Ted Robert Gurr. In the UNABOM
manuscript, Note 16 has quotes from Chapter 12, pages 476-478 of
Violence In America. The UNABOM subject sent a letter and a copy
of his manuscript to "Scientific American" on June 24, 1995. The
UNABOM subject referenced an article in the August, 1993 issue of
"Scientific American" by Russell Ruthen, entitled, "Strange Matters:
Can Advanced Accelerators Initiate Runaway Reactions?", and a
July, 1993 article entitled "Risk Analysis and Management," by M.
Granger Morgon. The UNABOM manuscript made reference to
articles in two magazines, "OMNI" and "Scientific American".

119. In a letter from Theodore Kaczynski to David Kaczynski dated
September 2, 1986, Theodore Kaczynski makes reference to "L.
Sprague DeCamp's The Ancient Engineers".

120. In an interview with the FBI on February 17-18, 1996, David
Kaczynski advised that the Kaczynski family subscribed to
"Scientific American" at least up until the time that he went to college.
Moreover, "Scientific American" was around the house and readily
available to family members. In Theodore Kaczynski's application
for admission to Harvard College dated October 22, 1957, question
"G" requests the applicant to cite examples of current reading, to
include books, magazines and newspapers. Theodore Kaczynski
cites "Scientific American" to answer this question. UTF
investigators   ___  several letters written to __ by Theodore
Kaczynski. In one of the letters dated May 26, 1991, Theodore
Kaczynski references an article entitled "Aspirin" in the January,
1991, issue of "Scientific American."

121. On March 24, 1996, Wanda Kaczynski, Theodore's mother,
provided a letter authored by Theodore dated December 14, 1969,
and addressed to the editor of the Chicago Daily News. Paragraph 2
of the letter began, "The stricter gun control laws recommended by
the U.S. Commission on Violence are a case in point."

122. The affiant notes that in 1968, President Lyndon Johnson
formed a commission to address the growing problem of violence in
America. This commission, the National Commission on the Causes
and Prevention of Violence, headed by Milton Eisenhower, tasked a
group of scholars to research the history and causes of violence in
America.
One of the members of this Commission was Eric Hoffer. James Q.
Wilson, a Harvard Professor, was on the Commission's Advisory
Committee.
The scholars produced a report, The History of Violence in America.
Historical and Comparative Perspectives which entailed a thorough
history of violence in the United States. This report was submitted to
the Commission in 1969. Based on this report and others submitted
by other groups working for the Commission, the Commission
issued a number of recommendations to include the initiation of some
sort of Federal gun control. These recommendations were reported in
the New York Times during the Summer, Fall and Winter of 1969.
Theodore Kaczynski's reference to the U.S. Commission on
Violence and stricter gun control suggests that he read The History of
Violence in America Historical and Comparative Perspectives,
another one of the four books referenced by the UNABOM subject in
the
UNABOM manuscript.


F. Analysis of UNABOM Letters by David Kaczynski

123. During the course of the UNABOM investigation, your affiant
has reviewed various interviews of individuals who, for a variety of
reasons, have suggested that the UNABOM manuscript was written
by a friend, co-worker, or relative. Often the conclusion reached by
those individuals was that, in their opinion, the writings of their
friend, co-worker, or relative were similar to that of UNABOM
manuscript.

124. David Kaczynski reviewed all of the writings attributed to the
UNABOM subject. He came to the conclusion that based upon
content, style, and specific phraseology of the writings that they were
written by his brother, Theodore Kaczynski.


G. Scholarly Analysis of UNABOM Manuscript

125. Your affiant has reviewed the opinions expressed by a number
of scholars and professional educators regarding their own
evaluations of the UNABOM manuscript and associated UNABOM
correspondence. None of these individuals had access to Theodore's
Kaczynski's identity as a suspect nor to any of his writings. One
individual (whose identity is known to the UTF) contacted the UTF
and stated that he is familiar with The Technological Society, by
Jacques Ellul, and that he believed the UNABOM subject has been
influenced by this book that was popular in 1964. David Kaczynski
advised investigators that around the 1971-72 period, the book by
Jacques Ellul, The Technological Society, became his brother's
"bible". In a letter from Theodore Kaczynski to his brother David,
postmarked August 21, 1981, Theodore Kaczynski refers to Jacques
Ellul and discusses Ellul's philosophy.

126. Another individual, who is a doctor and a holder of a PhD
(whose identity is known to the UTF), contacted the UTF and opined
that the UNABOM manuscript was authored by an individual that
was very familiar with and even paraphrased ideas from two books,
In Defense of Elitism by William A. Henry, III (1994) and
Behavioral Control by Perry London (1969). Your affiant notes that
Theodore Kaczynski cites Jacques Ellul's The Technological Society
and Perry London's Behavioral Control beginning on page 10 of his
23-page essay (attachment 3), and devotes several pages to London's
philosophy. Perry London, on page 128 of his book Behavioral
Control refers by name to University of Michigan Professor James
McConnell. Professor McConnell was injured by a UNABOM mail
bomb that was mailed from Salt Lake City, Utah, on November 12,
1985.


H. Theodore Kaczynski and Professor James McConnell.

127. As previously stated, transcripts obtained confirm that Theodore
Kaczynski pursued his Masters and Doctoral degrees at the
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, earning a PhD in
Mathematics in 1967. During the same period of time, Professor
James McConnell was a Professor at the same University.

128. Theodore Kaczynski's Harvard transcripts indicate that he took
a course entitled the "History of Science" while pursuing his
Bachelor of Arts degree at Harvard. The UNABOM explosive device
that was mailed to Professor McConnell on November 12, 1985,
was accompanied by a letter purported to be from a Ralph C.
Kloppenburg, Department of History, University of Utah, Salt Lake
City, Utah. The letter served as an enticement to encourage Professor
McConnell to open the package and review an unsolicited doctoral
dissertation. The letter read, in part:


"Dear Dr. McConnell:
I am a doctoral candidate in history at the University of Utah. My
field of interest is the History of Science, and I am writing my
dissertation on the development of the Behavioral Sciences during the
20th century...."


129. In the 23-page essay attributed to Theodore Kaczynski
(attachment 3), circa 1971, it states that "continued scientific and
technical progress will inevitably result in the extinction of individual
liberty" and lists as an "ominous" development "operant
conditioning, (after the manner of B.F. Skinner and friends)." The
essay ends by proposing the foundation of an organization dedicated
to stopping federal and corporate aid to scientific research.

130. In the second paragraph of the UNABOM letter from
"Kloppenburg" to Professor McConnell, the writer states in part,

"...I am attempting to analyse the factors in society at large that tend
to promote vigorous development in a given area of science, and
especially I am attempting to shed light on the way in which progress
in a particular field of research influences public attitudes toward that
field in such a manner as to further accelerate its development, as
through research grants..."

131. Professor McConnell's behavior modification techniques were
documented in scientific literature and involved "operant
conditioning". His findings were widely publicized in digests and
journals, as well as a Psychology textbook, Understanding Human
Behavior, which, according to the publisher, became one of the top
five best selling textbooks in its field. Professor McConnell received
research grants from the National Institute of Mental Health (a
Federal Agency) for his work in this field.


I. David Kaczynski's Chronology of Theodore Kaczynski

132. During interviews with UTF members, David Kaczynski
provided a review of Theodore Kaczynski's whereabouts and
activities from 1967 to the present, to the extent that he was
knowledgeable. David said that after graduating from the University
of Michigan, his brother announced he had obtained a teaching
position at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB). As
previously stated, Theodore Kaczynski was an Assistant Professor in
the UCB Department of Mathematics from July 16, 1967, through
June 30, 1969, and lived in Berkeley, California. While at Berkeley,
Theodore Kaczynski spent time in the woods in Northern California,
took up deer hunting and purchased a rifle.

133. UTF investigation has verified that Theodore Kaczynski was an
Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the University of California -
Berkeley (UCB), as confirmed in the UCB General Catalogue, 1968-
69. The Department of Mathematics was located in Campbell Hall.
Campbell Hall is located in close proximity to Cory Hall, which was
the site of placed UNABOM devices on July 2, 1982 and May 13,
1985.

134. In an interview with the UTF on February 18, 1996, David
Kaczynski recalled that shortly after departing UCB, his brother had
played a practical joke involving a forged letter. Theodore Kaczynski
sent a letter to one professor at UCB, purportedly from another
professor. David Kaczynski was quite impressed with the content and
manner in
which the letter was drafted. Dave could not explain this peculiar
behavior, other than to say that Ted did not have any friends of his
own to write to during that period.

135. David Kaczynski recalled that, in June, 1969, Theodore
Kaczynski quit his job at UCB. Shortly thereafter, David met his
brother in Wyoming and they travelled in Theodore Kaczynski's car
to British Columbia, Canada to find some land. Theodore Kaczynski
found some land near Prince George and filed homesteading-type
applications for the land. Theodore Kaczynski returned to his
family's home in Lombard, Illinois, in the summer of 1969, where
he lived while awaiting word from the Canadian government on his
land application.

136. During the winter of 1970, Theodore Kaczynski received a
letter from the Canadian government rejecting his application.
Theodore Kaczynski remained at his parent's home, but did not
work. He became very anti-social and withdrawn, and stayed in his
room reading. It was at this time that Theodore Kaczynski began
writing letters to editors concerning technology and liberty.

137. In July or August, 1970, David received a letter from his
parents, who shared the content of a note received from his brother.
The note said that their parents were the best parents anyone could
have, and he was sorry if he disappointed them.

138. Shortly thereafter, Theodore Kaczynski showed up at David's
apartment in Great Falls, Montana. Theodore Kaczynski told David
about conflict with their parents and said he had to get away.
Theodore Kaczynski wanted to know if David wanted to join him
and become 50-50 partners on a land purchase, to which David
agreed. Theodore Kaczynski found 1.4 acres near Lincoln, Montana,
for $2,100. Theodore and David Kaczynski each contributed $1,050
to purchase the land. Theodore Kaczynski thereafter purchased
lumber and supplies and, without any help, built a small cabin on the
site.

139. Wanda Kaczynski provided the UTF with copies of letters
Theodore Kaczynski wrote in 1969 and 1970 to editors of Chicago
newspapers and various magazine concerning technology and liberty.
Wanda also provided a copy of an undated letter from Theodore
Kaczynski that
said "no one could want better parents."

140. According to David, Theodore Kaczynski stayed at his Lincoln,
Montana, cabin until late 1972 or 1973, when he travelled to Salt
Lake City, Utah to find a job. According to David, Theodore
Kaczynski spent about six months in Salt Lake City, working as an
unskilled carpenter's helper for a private contractor. David visited
overnight with his brother at an apartment in Salt Lake City during
David's trip from Chicago to Great Falls, Montana. David Kaczynski
recalled that Theodore Kaczynski thereafter returned to Montana in
June, 1973.

141. In the winter of 1974, Theodore Kaczynski wrote the family a
letter to say that he would be away camping for a while and that they
should not worry if they did not hear from him.


J. Comparison of Theodore Kaczynski's known whereabouts with
UNABOM Device Dates

142. The UTF has evaluated information provided during the
interviews of David and Wanda Kaczynski, and compared Theodore
Kaczynski's whereabouts with the dates of the following UNABOM
events:

143. UNABOM Device #1 was found at the University of Illinois,
Chicago Circle Campus on May 25, 1978. Theodore Kaczynski
began a job with Foam Cutting Engineers in Chicago on June 26,
1978. David
believed that his brother returned to Chicago from Montana a few
days, to no more than 30 days, before starting this job. According to
David, when Theodore Kaczynski returned, he took a Greyhound
bus from Montana to the main bus terminal in Chicago.

144. UNABOM Device #2 was placed at Northwestern University
on May 9, 1979. According to David, Theodore Kaczynski was
working in Chicago on May 9, 1979.

145. UNABOM Device #3 was mailed from the Chicago area on
November 14, 1979. David recalled that Theodore Kaczynski had
gone to work at Prince Castle Restaurant Equipment Division in
August or September, 1978, and then quit in the summer of 1979.
Theodore Kaczynski stayed at his parent's home for awhile and then
borrowed David's car, thereafter travelling to Canada for 6- 8 weeks,
to look for land in Saskatchewan. Theodore Kaczynski returned to
Chicago and later to Montana that summer or fall. Wanda Kaczynski
believed that her son remained in Lombard until the fall of 1979
before returning to Montana. She remembered walking with him to
the local commuter train in Lombard.

146. UNABOM Device #4 was mailed from the Chicago area on
June 3, 1980 to Percy Wood, then President of United Airlines. UTF
investigation has determined that in a letter to David from Theodore
Kaczynski, dated August 21, 1981, translated from Spanish to
English, Theodore Kaczynski writes, "Last year I was absent for a
large part of the summer." The UTF has documented Theodore
Kaczynski's stay at the Park Hotel, Helena, Montana, on April 14-
18, 1980, May 12-14, 1980 and August 13-15, 1980. This would
have allowed an opportunity for Theodore Kaczynski to travel to
Chicago during his absence from Montana.

147. UNABOM Device #5 was placed at the University of Utah on
October 8, 1981. Theodore Kaczynski was living in Montana during
this time frame. Theodore Kaczynski stayed at the Park Hotel in
Helena, Montana on November 9-10, 1981, which was within a
month of the placement of Device #5.

148. UNABOM Device #6 was mailed from Provo, Utah on April
23, 1982. Theodore Kaczynski was living in Montana during this
time frame and stayed at the Park Hotel in Helena on May 12- 3,
1982, within a month of the mailing of Device #6.

149. There were four UNABOM Devices during 1985, the
UNABOM Subject's most active year. UNABOM Device #9 was
mailed from Oakland, California on May 8, 1985. UNABOM Device
#8 was found at Cory Hall, University of California, Berkeley on
May 15, 1985, but witnesses reported first observing it several days
earlier. UNABOM Device #10 was mailed from Salt Lake City on
November 12, 1985. UNABOM Device #11 was placed outside
Rentech Computer Rental, Sacramento, California on December 11,
1985.

150. From a review of Theodore Kaczynski's letters mailed to his
brother and furnished to the UTF, it was determined that Theodore
Kaczynski had planned to visit David at David's cabin in Alpine,
Texas in 1985. By letter dated February 10, 1986, he canceled the
trip stating, "Well, I can't come to see you after all. I am extremely
sorry to inconvenience you with all these changes of plans. All I can
say is that these changes of mind are not frivolous and arbitrary -
they are due to changes of circumstances. There is more to this than
you realize."

151. In a March 8, 1996, ____  Kaczynski said he had gone to either
California, Arizona or Utah to look for a job. ___ remembered it was
a warm weather state, one of the three states he mentioned.

152. During September or October, 1986, David visited his brother
at his cabin in Montana. Prior to the visit, Theodore Kaczynski sent
David a letter postmarked September 2, 1986, which said:

"Dave-you can come between Sept. 27 and Oct. 4 inclusive, but not
outside those dates."

153. David stated that he did see his brother at this time, but also
stated that he has not seen his brother since the 1986 visit to
Montana.

154. UNABOM Device #12 was placed at the outside rear of
CAAMS Computer Store in Salt Lake City on February 20, 1987.
___   device as a white male, approximately 25-30 years old, 5'10"
to 6' in height, 165 pounds, lean, wiry build, with a reddish, rough
looking complexion and strawberry blond hair and light mustache.

155. Theodore Kaczynski is described as a white male, 5'9" 150
pounds with a lean, wiry, appearance, and dark colored hair. Two
photographs of Theodore Kaczynski are being submitted with this
affidavit. Attachment 5 is a photograph purportedly depicting
Theodore Kaczynski taken during his years at UCB. This
photograph was obtained from a faculty member at UCB. Attachment
6 is a 1991 Montana Drivers License photograph of Theodore
Kaczynski.

156. In 1989 David wrote Theodore Kaczynski indicating that he,
David, planned to live with his future wife, Linda. Theodore
Kaczynski responded with anger. He told David he did not want to
communicate with him again. He also told David to write to him only
if he had something really important to say, and to do so by placing a
red line on the envelope beneath the stamp, signifying the importance
of the contents. Theodore Kaczynski said that he intended to destroy
any envelopes that did not have a red line.

157. David also sent his brother a letter requesting that he be the best
man at David's July, 1990 wedding, but Theodore Kaczynski did not
respond.

158. In September, 1990, David sent his brother a letter advising him
that their father was very ill. Theodore Kaczynski responded and
stated that this had been an appropriate use of the red line. Their
father died on October 2, 1990, and David wrote Theodore
Kaczynski to advise him of the memorial service. Theodore
Kaczynski did not attend the service.

159. In January or February, 1991, Theodore Kaczynski wrote to
David asking for his share of the father's estate, which was
approximately $60,000. Theodore Kaczynski did not receive this
money, but did get $7,000 from his mother under separate
circumstances.

160. In the summer of 1991, Theodore Kaczynski wrote David
saying he did not want anything further to do with the family.

161. In November, 1994, Theodore Kaczynski wrote David asking
for a $1,000 loan, followed by another request for a $2,000 loan.
David sent the money to his brother in the form of cashier's checks.

162. In November, 1995, David wrote a letter to his brother stating
his concern for Theodore Kaczynski's welfare and suggesting a visit
to Montana. Theodore Kaczynski responded by a letter postmarked
November 30, 1995 in which he rejected the idea of a visit, and told
David he should not write except for practical matters related to the
property.


K. Further Analysis of Theodore Kaczynski's Activities and
UNABOM Incidents

163. The UTF has undertaken an extensive investigation of Theodore
Kaczynski's known activities, with the objective of accounting for
his whereabouts and location on specific dates between May 25,
1978, the date of the first UNABOM event, and June 24, 1995, the
date of the mailing of the UNABOM manuscripts from San
Francisco, California. In connection with this investigation, the UTF
has reviewed the following materials:

164.  ___

165. Interviews and documents from a hotel in Helena, Montana
___  , where Theodore Kaczynski stayed overnight on 31 occasions
between April 14, 1980 and October 4, 1995;

166. Interviews and documents from a bank in Missoula, Montana
(Western Federal Savings) where Theodore Kaczynski had two
checking accounts and two Certificates of Deposit (CD) accounts. On
May 15, 1984, Theodore Kaczynski obtained two Certificates of
Deposit, for $500 each. CD account #207 was closed on September
26, 1984. CD account #208 was closed on August 20, 1985. On
May 22, 1985 Ted opened checking account #110093923 with a
$600 check and $51.17 he received on interest from CD #207. This
checking account was closed on July 13, 1994: Theodore Kaczynski
wrote approximately 400 checks on this account between May 22,
1985 and July 13, 1994. There were no deposits to the account from
1991 until the account was closed on July 13, 1994. The second
account reflects the writing of 32 checks between February 21, 1995
and August 23, 1995, when the account was closed with a cash
withdrawal of 5203.53 in Missoula, Montana;

167. A total of approximately 100 letters written by Theodore
Kaczynski to his brother, David, or mother, Wanda, with verifiable
postmarks. Based on this review, with the exception of a deposit
posted to one of the bank accounts on December 11, 1985, none of
the postmarks, checks, hotel stays, or visits to the doctor are in
conflict with dates of UNABOM incidents. The December 11, 1985
date corresponds to the placement of a bomb at Rentech in
Sacramento, California.- UTF has been unable to determine as yet,
whether this posting date accurately indicates that Theodore
Kaczynski personally made a deposit on that day.

168. Recent investigation has determined that public bus
transportation exists which would enable an individual to travel from
Lincoln, Montana to San Francisco or Oakland, California, and
return. RimRock Trailways buses depart once per day from Lincoln
to both Missoula and Great Falls, Montana. From either of those
cities, bus service is available to Helena, Montana, or, from
Missoula, to Butte, Montana. RimRock Trailways buses depart
southbound daily from Helena, Montana, beginning at 9:00 a.m.
They travel south through Butte to Idaho Falls, Idaho, where
connection is made with Greyhound Lines. From Idaho Falls,
Greyhound proceeds to Salt Lake City, Utah, with connections
available to the San Francisco Bay Area via Reno, Nevada and
Sacramento, California.

169. Such travel from Helena takes an average of 25.5 hours to
Sacramento, 28 hours to Oakland and 28.5 hours to San Francisco.
Return trips take the same amount of time and can be started several
times per day. It is also possible to travel from Missoula, Montana to
Butte, Montana on Greyhound Lines (and then on to Idaho Falls) but
that takes several hours longer than to starting from Helena.

170.  ___   photograph of Theodore Kaczynski as that of a person
has had as a passenger between Lincoln and Missoula "three or four
times" within the past year.

171.  ___  identified a photograph of Theodore Kaczynski as that of
a person had as a passenger between Lincoln and Missoula "four or
five times" within the past year.

172. ___  identified a photograph of Theodore Kaczynski as a person
__ has had as a passenger on the bus route between Idaho Falls,
Idaho and Great Falls, Montana (passing through Helena) a number
of times since __ began working for RimRock in September, 1994.
__ pacifically recalled seeing Kaczynski at the bus driver switch point
in Butte "at least three or four times."

173. ___ UTF investigators interviewed ___   stated  __ was familiar
with Theodore Kaczynski and that ___    stated that Kaczynski "hops
on a bus and goes and visits a lot more than anyone thought."  __
recalled
Kaczynski telling  _   these bus trips.  __  about two or three years
ago, Kaczynski was very excited about taking a trip "back home  __
that in the last two to three years, Kaczynski has gone back to the
Chicago or Detroit area on a couple of occasions. __   stated
Kaczynski went "down" to see his Mexican friend at least once in the
past two to three years.  __  this Mexican friend's situation really
bothered Kaczynski.  __  believes Kaczynski- visited this friend in
either California or Colorado.

L. Money Received by Theodore Kaczynski from David and Wanda
Kaczynski:

174. UTF investigation has identified two bank account  __
Montana, maintained by Theodore Kaczynski from 1984 to 1994 and
February 21, 1995 through August 23, 1995. A third bank account
in
__
Montana belonging to Theodore Kaczynski has also been identified
__

175. A review of Wanda Kaczynski's canceled checks and David
Kaczynski's records reflect the following funds sent to and/or
deposited by Theodore Kaczynski, on the following approximate
dates. The designation of a question mark indicates the UTF's
inability to determine the specific date reflected on the document.


CHECK DATE......... DATE POSTED............ AMOUNT

5/16/85............... 5/2?/85.............. $600.00

12/5/85............... 12/28/85..............$600.00

(received from David)....................... $1,000.00

2/1/95

(received from David)........................$2,000.00

TOTAL (5/16/85 - 2/1/95).....................$16,802.81


176. As previously stated-herein, UTF has obtained documents
pertaining to a deposit on a bank account maintained by Theodore
Kaczynski on December 11, 1985.

177. Of significance with respect to the above dates between 5/16/85
- 2/1/95, Theodore Kaczynski received $16,802.81, but his bank
records indicate deposits of a lesser amount.

178. Theodore Kaczynski opened the first account  __  May 22,
1985, with the $600 check received from Wanda, dated May 16,
1985. The UNABOM subject was in the San Francisco Bay Area
sometime between May 8, 1985 and May 15, 1985, UNABOM
Device #8 was mailed to Boeing on May 8, 1985 and Device #9 was
observed in Room 264 of Cory Hall, UCB, several days prior to the
May 15, 1985 detonation.

179. Theodore Kaczynski deposited the $600 check dated December
5, 1985 from his mother on December 28, 1995, and the $25.00
check, dated December 27, 1985, from his mother on January 8,
1986. UNABOM Device #11 was placed at Rentech Computer
Rental, Sacramento, California on December 11, 1985, requiring the
presence of the UNABOM subject in Sacramento.

180. Suspect received $1,000 from David circa November 14, 1994,
approximately one month prior to UNABOM Event #15, mailed to
Thomas Mosser from San Francisco, California, on Saturday,
December 3, 1994.

181. Suspect received $2,000 from David circa January 19, 1995
and prior to the mailing of UNABOM Device #16 to Gilbert Murray
from Oakland on April 20, 1995 and the mailing of the UNABOM
manuscript from San Francisco on June 24, 1995.

182. It should be noted that Theodore Kaczynski sent David a letter
postmarked November 2, 1994, requesting $1,000.

183. By letter postmarked December 23, 1994, Theodore Kaczynski
requested the additional $2,000, stating "I need another $2,000...if
and when I get over present difficulties sufficiently...There won't be
any further requests for loans...if another $2,000 won't do it, then I
guess nothing will, so I may as well give up."


M. Further Analysis of Characteristics Between the UNABOM
Subject and Theodore Kaczynski:

184. UTF investigators have reviewed over 100 letters written by
Theodore Kaczynski to his mother, brother and Dr. Goren, wherein
Theodore Kaczynski discusses his feelings of anger. Likewise, the
UNABOM subject expresses anger and frustration with modern
society because of its dependence on modern technology. This anger
is reflected in the UNABOM manuscript.

185. In an undated letter to David from Theodore Kaczynski, he
wrote:

"As you know, I have no respect for law or morality. Why I never
committed any crime? (of course, I'm not talking about something
like shooting a grouse out of season now and then. I mean felony
type stuff - burglary, arson, murder, etc.) Lack of motive? Hardly.
As you know, I have a good deal of anger in me and there are lots of
people I'd like to hurt. Risk? In some cases, yes. But there are other
cases in which I can figure out ways of doing naughty things so that
the risk would be insignificant. I am forced to the humiliating
confession that the reason I've never committed any crime is that I
have been successfully brainwashed by society. On an intellectual
level I have only contempt for authority, but on an animal level I have
all too much respect for it. My training has been quite successful in
this regard and the strength of my conditioned inhibitions is such that
I don't believe I could ever commit a serious crime.
Knowing my attitude toward psychological manipulation of the
individual by society, you can imagine how humiliating it is for me to
admit to myself that I have been successfully manipulated."


N. Additional Findings by the UNABOM Task Force

186. UTF investigations have obtained a copy of Theodore
Kaczynski's Harvard transcripts and other material from Harvard. In
the Theodore Kaczynski's Harvard file in a letter from his mother,
dated July 16, 1958, which states:

"Much of his time is spent at home reading and contriving numerous
gadgets made up of wood, string, wire, tape, lenses, gears, wheels,
etc.; that test out various principals in physics. His table and desk are
always a mess of test tubes, chemicals, batteries, ground coal, etc.
He will miss greatly, I think, this browsing and puttering in his
messy makeshift lab."

187. On March 23, 1996, Wanda T. Kaczynski, Theodore
Kaczynski's mother, was interviewed by Special Agents of the FBI
concerning her son. Mrs. Kaczynski provided the agents with ninety
items which included: (1) further letters written by her son Ted, (2)
several essays written by her son, (3) essays that she had written, (4)
copies of checks made payable to her son from May, 1985 through
July, 1991, and (5) a handmade cylindrical wooden box containing a
handwritten letter from Theodore Kaczynski.

188. Among the letters was a handwritten letter to his mother where
Theodore Kaczynski asks her to mail a fourth "manuscript" entitled
"Three Worthy Artisans", to the magazine editors of Harper's
Weekly. Also included in those documents obtained from Wanda
Kaczynski was a typed article entitled, "How I Blew Up   __   by
"Apias Tuberosa, Pseudym [sic] for T.J. Kaczynski, 463 N. Ridge,
Lombard, Illinois 60148." Your affiant notes that the UNABOM
subject has used several pseudonyms in connection with his devices
and mailings.

189. In the  __  article, Theodore Kaczynski describes how a high
school classmate blew up a mixture of chemicals provided to him by
Theodore Kaczynski. He writes in the article:

"When I was in high school I took a course in chemistry. There was
only one aspect of the subject which interested me, as any chemist
could have seen from a brief inspection of my rather specialized
home collection of reagents; (sic) powdered aluminum, powdered
magnesium, powdered zinc, sulfur, potassium, nitrate, potassium
permanganate...in suitable combinations these things are capable of
exploding." "One day in the laboratory, having finished my assigned
experiment early, I though I might as well spend the extra time
pursuing my favorite line of research. On theoretical grounds, a
mixture of red phosphorus and potassium chlorate seemed
promising. (I did not know at the time that it is the red phosphorus in
the scratching surface of a match-book, together with the potassium
chlorate in the match-head, that makes a match light so readily. I later
found that the mixture is extremely sensitive to friction and practically
impossible to work with. The reader is advised not to play with it."

190. An analysis of-the elements found in the first six UNABOM
devices indicates that they contained powdered aluminum, potassium
chlorate, and match-heads, which were included the specific
references made by Theodore Kaczynski in his essay above.

191. The UTF has obtained copies of letters sent to  __   These letters
include requests for various types of psychological, scientific, and
historical magazines and books.

192. Your affiant has reviewed a letter of April, 1991, signed by
Theodore Kaczynski and sent to  __   in that letter, Theodore
Kaczynski describe  __   that he had been "under strong stress" since
the "age of 38." He also wrote the reasons for the stress" are
personal and I do
not intend to discuss them. For the least four or five years I've been
under more stress than previously."

193. A Sylvan Learning Center was opened in Helena, Montana in
1994, one of three such centers in the entire state of Montana.
Helena, Montana is approximately 60 miles from Theodore
Kaczynski's home. The Sylvan Learning Center is a business whose
primary focus is increasing the educational skills of high school
students, with a
particular emphasis on English and Mathematical subjects.

194. In the UNABOM Manuscript (Attachment 2) specific reference
is made to the Sylvan Learning Center. This is the only business
mentioned specifically, by name, in the UNABOM manuscript.

195. During her March 23, 1996 interview, Wanda Kaczynski
advised that she read articles about the "Unabomer" in the newspaper
which described the "Unabomer" as a loner who is against
technology. She noted that the description fit her son, Ted, and she
said, "people like my son Ted are vulnerable to suspicion. He likes to
live alone, likes privacy, is an environmentalist, and he deplores the
excesses of technology." Although she did not believe that Ted is the
"Unabomer," she was upset because his lifestyle would lead the
authorities to suspect him, and it would be unfair. She also said, "but
if it is him, he must be stopped."

196. She stated that she and her deceased husband had visited
Theodore Kaczynski at his Montana residence until the mid-1980's.
She recalled Theodore Kaczynski completing a lot of work to his
property including the construction of a root cellar. She claimed that
the root cellar was visible from the front door of her son's cabin and
located across a creek some 100 to 150 feet from the cabin. She
described it as an enclosure in the side of a hill, covered with sod,
and some type of door covering it.

197. Wanda recalled that she had purchased a portable manual
typewriter as a gift for Theodore Kaczynski in 1984 or 1985. She
explained that it was either transported or shipped to her son in
Montana.Mrs. Kaczynski said that the family had a manual and
electric typewriter at their family home in Lombard, Illinois in the late
1970's. She said that Theodore Kaczynski would have access to
either of those typewriters.

198. It is noted by your affiant that numerous comparative samples
were obtained from typewritten letters attributed to Theodore
Kaczynski or members of his family. To date, forensic analysis
indicates that those typewritten samples do not match the typewritten
documents connected to the Unabom events.

199. In paragraph 185 of the UNABOM Manuscript (Attachment 2),
it is stated "...well, you can't eat your cake and have it too." In a
letter signed by Theodore Kaczynski, to his mother Wanda
Kaczynski, date unknown, Theodore Kaczynski compares "...the
increase in the complexity of our social organization that actually
make necessary the erosion of privacy and freedom. We will be
sacrificing some of the materialistic benefits of technology, but there
just isn't any other way. We can't eat our cake and have it too."

200. It is noted by your affiant that the common use English
Language phrase is, "You can't have your cake and eat it too!"

201. Handwritten samples of the UNABOM subject have been
obtained for possible forensic comparison. The FBI Laboratory has
concluded that there are insufficient samples by which a comparison
could be
made to the handwritten letters of Theodore Kaczynski.

202. A number of stamps have been obtained from devices mailed or
placed by the UNABOM subject. A number of stamps have been
obtained from the letters mailed and written by Theodore Kaczynski.
According to the FBI Laboratory there is no forensic correlation
between those samples.

203. Latent fingerprints attributable to devices mailed and/or placed
by the UNABOM subject were compared to those found on the
letters attributed to Theodore Kaczynski. According to the FBI
Laboratory, no forensic correlation exists between those samples.

204. Your affiant is aware that other individuals have conducted
analyses of the UNABOM Manuscript  __   determined that the
Manuscript was written by another individual, not Theodore
Kaczynski, who had also been a suspect in the investigation.

205. Numerous other opinions from experts have been provided as
to the identity of the UNABOM subject. None of those opinions
named Theodore Kaczynski as a possible author.


V

OTHER SUSPECTS

206. During this investigation the UTF agents have looked at a
number of individuals as potential suspects. These investigations
resulted either from tips provided by the public, leads given by other
law enforcement officials, or analysis of data obtained from several
sources. (As an example of the data analysis, the UTF obtain lists of
individuals who attended certain schools during specific time
periods. The agents then identified those individuals who were at a
combination of the schools at the times that devices were either
placed or sent there.) However, after further investigation, additional
evidence was developed as to these individuals that indicated that the
person should no longer be considered a priority suspect. (While we
have not included all of the details of those individual investigations
in this affidavit, it is available for the Court's review should the
Court so desire.)


VI

REGISTRATION CHECK

207. On February 28, 1996, Special Agent Joyce L. Seymour,
BATF, caused a check of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms Explosives Licensing Section located in Atlanta, Georgia to
determine if Theodore John Kaczynski, date of birth May 22, 1942,
has been issued a federal license to manufacture explosives. The
results of said check indicate that Theodore John Kaczynski, date of
birth May 22, 1942, had not been licensed to manufacture explosives
as defined in Title 18 United States Code, Chapter 842.

208. On February 28, 1996, Special Agent Joyce L. Seymour caused
a check of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms National
Firearms Registration and Transfer Records in Washington, D.C. to
determine if Theodore John Kaczynski, date of birth May 22, 1942,
had any destructive devices registered to him. The results of said
check indicate that there were in fact no firearm or destructive devices
registered to Theodore John Kaczynski, date of birth May 22, 1942.


VII

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION TO EXECUTE WARRANT
AT ANYTIME, DAY OR NIGHT

209. As outlined above, Theodore John Kaczynski has been able to
avoid identification for almost twenty years. In the June 24, 1995
letter to Professor Thomas Tyler of the University of California at
Berkeley, the UNABOM subject apologized for sending carbon
copies of his manuscript. He advised that he could not photocopy the
manuscript
for fear of fingerprint detection.

210. In order to assure, to the extent possible, the safety of the public
and the agents, surveillance will be conducted on the premises and on
Theodore John Kaczynski for a period prior to the execution of the
warrant. In the event that Theodore John Kaczynski suspects that he
is being surveilled, he may attempt to obtain an explosive device or
destroy evidence. Because of the potential for extreme danger in
executing a warrant at such a premises, it is requested that the agents
be authorized to commence the search as the situation dictates at
anytime, day or night.


VIII

PROLONGED EXECUTION

211. It is expected that the execution may take an unusually long
time. The explosive devices that Theodore John Kaczynski has
manufactured in the past have been extremely dangerous and easily
detonated. It is the opinion of SSA Mohnal that Theodore John
Kaczynski has manufactured more than one device at a time. Further,
in the April
24, 1995 letter to Warren Hoge of the New York Times, the Unabom
subject stated that he had spent a considerable amount of time testing
various devices. As a result of all this information, it is believed that
Theodore John Kaczynski may have fully operational explosive
devices on the premises. The executing agents will first have to
assure themselves that Theodore Kaczynski has not set explosive
"boobytraps" aimed at destroying evidence and killing agents. The
initial search for such devices may take hours and even longer
if explosives are found.

212. It is anticipated, that once the premises are secure, experts in
various laboratory techniques, who will have been flow in from
around the country, will conduct the evidence search and perform
tests on various items even before they are moved. It is expected that
this
process could take more than a day. It is therefore requested that the
executing and searching agents be given permission to secure and
leave the premises for periods of rest and be able to return to continue
the search. During their absence, agents will maintain security of the
premises to assure that no unauthorized persons enter. In no event
will this extended search take longer than 7 days (168 hours) without
additional authorization of the court.


IX

213. Based on all of the information contained in this affidavit,
which establishes a continual and consistent pattern of conduct
between 1978 and the present date, and based on the expert opinion
of Supervisory Special Agent of the FBI's Explosive Unit, who has
stated that probable cause exists that all of the below-listed items
would be utilized in the manufacture, construction, assembly,
packaging, and mailing of the explosive devices, your Affiant

1. The original examination was conducted by Bureau of Alcohol
Tobacco and Firearms (ATF). Their report indicated that the device
was a hoax. Subsequent examination by the FBI and Postal Labs
made in connection with the other devices have resulted in a different
opinion. In the April 20, 1995, letter to the New York Times the
Unabomber noted that it "was a botched operation".

MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT
OF MOTION TO RETURN PROPERTY,
TO DISMISS COMPLAINT AND TO
PROHIBIT FURTHER PROSECUTION

Theodore John Kaczynski (Kaczynski) has moved the
Court for an order that would return his property,
dismiss the complaint pending against him, and prohibit
the government from prosecuting him further for crimes
related to the so called "unabomber" investigation. This
memorandum supports that motion.

JURISDICTION

Rule 41(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure
allows for the filing of a pre-indictment motion for
return of property in the "district court for the district in
which the property was seized" Id. Also see, Center Art
Galleries-Hawaii v. United States of America, 875 F.2d
747, 752 (9th Cir. 1989), quoting with apparent approval
United States v. Roberts, 852 F.2d 671 (2nd Cir. 1988).

Courts have divided on the standard applicable to pre-
indictment, as opposed to post-indictment, Rule 41(e)
motions. For example, in In re Campola, 543 F.Supp. 115
(N.D. N.Y. 1982) the court held that a pre-indictment
motion for return of property should only be considered
when the following factors are satisfied.

(1) when there has been a clear showing of a search and
seizure in callous disregard of the fourth amendment or
some other constitutional or statutory provision;

(2) when the movant would suffer irreparable injury if
relief is not granted; and

(3) when the movant is without an adequate remedy at
law.

Another district court, however, holds that Rule 41(e)
requires consideration of a pre-indictment suppression
motion without regard to such restrictions, which are
usually applicable to lawsuits requesting equitable relief.
Roberts v. United States, 656 F.Supp. 929, 932-33
(S.D.N.Y. 1987), rev'd on other gr. 852 F.2d 671 (2d
Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 993, 109 S.Ct. 556, 102
L.Ed.2d 583 (1988).

Without waiving his right to argue later on that the
nonrestrictive standard of Roberts applies, Kaczynski
asserts that he meets the factors set forth in Campola.
First, as the discussion below indicates, there is sufficient
evidence to justify the tentative conclusion that the United
States deliberately and systematically leaked information
to the media in derogation of Kaczynski's 4th and 5th
Amendment rights. Second, without quick and decisive
action by this Court through treatment of this motion,
Kaczynski will forever be denied his constitutional
entitlement to an unbiased grand jury indictment(s),
therefore the potential for irreparable harm is substantial.
And, third, there simply is no other remedy. The
government should not be allowed to proceed before
various grand juries throughout the country, that have
been permanently poisoned by the government's
outrageous conduct in disclosing to the media the highly
incriminating nature of the evidence taken from
Kaczynski's cabin. Because, once those indictments are
handed up, and undoubtedly they will be, the government
will be able to argue that proceeding to trial before a petit
jury is the appropriate cure for its misbehavior. See
United States v. Mechanik, 475 U.S. 66, 67, 106 S.Ct.
938, 940 (1986) (petit jury's guilty verdict demonstrates
that there was probable cause to charge the-defendant thus
convictions must stand despite Rule 6 violation).

Therefore, the Court should act now and take this
inevitable argument out of the government's quiver, by
making an immediate determination of the issues raised
herein. And in the meantime, while these issues are being
considered, the Court should prohibit the government
from going before any grand jury, in any district on any
charge, until a decision on this motion has been rendered.

Having stated the jurisdictional base for this motion, we
now proceed to argue its merits.

INTRODUCTION

This case began on April 3, 1996, when the government
applied to this Court under seal for a warrant to search
Kaczynski's cabin at Lincoln, Montana. After considering
the application the Court granted the government's
request and a search warrant was issued.

In due course a search of Kaczynski's cabin ensued. And
almost immediately media reports started coming over the
airwaves (radio and T.V.) that an unidentified person,
thought to be the "unabomber", had been apprehended.
These initial reports went unabated for several hours.
Thereafter, similar reports were issued containing more
details. Not only did these later reports identify Kaczynski
as the "unabomber", they also contained blow-by-blow
accounts of the alleged evidence being taken by the
government agents from his cabin. Next the print media
became involved and newspapers across the country began
publishing similar type stories. And this pattern continues,
even at this writing.

The burden to conduct a fair and thorough prosecution
undoubtedly falls to the government. And in no manner
do we challenge the government's right to do so.
However, in carrying out such duties prosecutors are
subject to constraints and responsibilities that do not apply
to other lawyers. While it can generally be said that
lawyers representing private parties must do everything
ethically permissible to advance their clients' interests,
lawyers and their investigative agents representing the
government in criminal cases serve truth and justice first.
The prosecutor's job is not just to win, but to win fairly,
staying well within the rules. For example, it has been
specifically held that

The United States Attorney is the representative not of an
ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty
whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as
its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest,
therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win
a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he is in a
peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the
twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or
innocence suffer. He may prosecute with earnestness and
vigor -indeed, he should do so. But, while he may strike
hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as
much his duty to refrain from improper methods
calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use
every legitimate means to bring about a just one.

Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629,
633 (1935) overruled on other grounds, Stirone v. United
States, 361 U.S. 212, 80 S.Ct. 270 (1960). And, in a
similar vein, Justice Douglas once warned

The function of the prosecutor under the Federal
Constitution is not to tack as many skins of victims as
possible to the wall. [H]er function is to vindicate the right
of the people as expressed in the laws and give those
accused of crime a fair trial.

Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 648-49, 94
S.Ct. 1868, 1874 (1974) (Douglas, J. dissenting).

Thus, although the warrant granted the government the
right to search Kaczynski's cabin, at the same time it was
the government's responsibility to do so in a manner that
would be considerate of Mr. Kaczynski's statutory and
constitutional rights. Yet in this latter respect the
government has utterly, miserably, and most of all
deliberately, failed. And blame for this condition must be
assigned to those responsible for it.

Against this background Kaczynski makes three
contentions.

CONTENTIONS

First, Kaczynski has a right to due process and equal
protection, under the United States Constitution, which
includes the right to an unbiased grand jury process. See
U.S. Const. Amend. 5. Also Kaczynski has the right to be
free from unreasonable search and seizure and to a fair
trial under the 4th and 6th Amendments, respectively.

Second, these rights have been irreversibly abridged by
the government's deliberate and unlawful disclosure of
the evidence allegedly seized and/or information allegedly
obtained as a result of the search of Kaczynski's cabin.

Third, the government should be held accountable for this
calculated destruction of Kaczynski's rights through the
imposition of three sanctions: (i) return of all of the
property taken from his cabin; (ii) dismissal of the
pending complaint, and (iii) an order from the Court that
would temporarily, and then permanently, prohibit the
government from prosecuting Kaczynski any further.

We now address these three contentions.

ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITY

Kaczynski has the rights to due process and equal
protection which includes an unbiased grand jury process.

The due process provision of the 5th Amendment was
intended to guarantee procedural standards adequate and
appropriate to protect at all times people charged with or
suspected of crime by those holding positions of power
and authority. Chambers v. State of Florida, 309 U.S.
227, 236, 60 S.Ct. 472, 476-477 (1940). Also, the Due
Process Clause of the 5th Amendment to the United States
Constitution includes a guarantee of equal protection that
is parallel to that which is contained in the 14th
Amendment. See, e.g., Weinberger v. Wisenfield, 420
U.S. 636, 638, n.2, 95 S.Ct. 1225, 1228, n.2. An action
that violates equal protection when committed by a state
actor violates the due process clause of the 5th
Amendment when committed by a federal actor. Johnson
v. Robison, 415 U.S. 361, 364-365, n.4, 94 S.Ct. 1160,
1165, n.4 (1974).

Furthermore, the 5th Amendment affords the accused the
right to be indicted by an unbiased grand jury. See e.g.
Beck v. Washington, 369 U.S. 541, 546, 82 S.Ct. 955,
958 (1962) (due process probably entitles the accused to
an unbiased grand jury in venues that employ such a
procedure). The grand jury is part of our constitutional
heritage, which was brought to this country with the
common law. It functions as a "barrier to reckless or
unfounded charges." United States v. Mandujano, 425
U.S. 564, 571 96 S.Ct. 1768, 1774 (1976). For centuries
the office of the grand jury has been to provide a shield
against "arbitrary or oppressive action, by insuring that
serious criminal accusations will be brought only upon the
considered judgment of a representative body of citizens
acting under oath and under judicial instruction and
guidance." Ibid.

In contrast to these overarching due process rights
contained in the 5th Amendment, the 4th and 6th
Amendments embody more particular guarantees. Under
the former the people enjoy the right to be free from
"unreasonable searches and seizures." See, e.g. United
States v. Hotchkiss, 60 F.Supp. 405, 407 (Diet. Ct.
Maryland 1945) (whether search and seizure is
unreasonable depends on whether what was done and
found bears reasonable relation to authority then
possessed or transcends it to become oppressive). And
under the 6th Amendment the accused enjoys the right to
a fair, speedy and public trial. See, e.g., Duncan v.
Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 194, 88 S.Ct. 1444 (1968) (right
to jury trial is a fundamental one).

These rights have been irreversibly abridged.

Since April 3, 1996, the government has been
intentionally leaking highly prejudicial information to the
print and electronic news media. To prove this we have
annexed hereto a survey of news articles (See Appendix
A).

These articles contain information concerning damning
evidence alleged to have been found in Kaczynski's cabin.
And in each instance the source for such information was
a government agent.

In our second appendix (See Appendix B), we share with
the Court a simple word search that we conducted on a
news source database. The word configuration that we
used for the search was: "KACZYNSKI UNA-BOMB
FEDERAL OFFICIAL ANONYMOUS SOURCE". This
word formula turned up 2, 204 stories throughout
America.1

This pattern of deliberate disclosure by government
officials has unalterably compromised Kaczynski's
constitutional rights in two separate but related ways.
First, it rendered the search of Kaczynski's cabin
"unreasonable" within the meaning of the Fourth
Amendment. In simple terms, it was constitutionally
unreasonable within the meaning of the 4th Amendment
for government officials and agents to provide the media
minute-by-minute, graphic descriptions of the evidence
being collected, when they knew that such evidence would
eventually have to be put before a grand jury or juries in
order to bring charges.

These deliberate disclosures poisoned the entire
population of grand jurors within the United States
against Mr. Kaczynski. Thus, by carrying out the search
of the cabin in the unreasonable manner described above,
the government has made it forever impossible for Mr.
Kaczynski to obtain his constitutional entitlement to an
unbiased review of the evidence by the grand jury.

The government's conduct in this case has been primitive
and most nearly resembles the lynch mob mentality
depicted in such classics as the Ox Bo Incident (Walter C.
Clark, 1943), just to  name one. The criminal trial
process is not like an election to be won through the use
of the T.V., radio and newspapers. It is a cautious and
controlled series of procedures designed to determine
fairly the actual guilt or innocence of the accused. In Mr.
Kaczynski's case the possibility that he could ever be
afforded anything that might even remotely resemble that
process has been forever lost.

The government's predictable response to all of this will
be two-sided. First, the government will contend that it is
not responsible for the leaks. And then it will argue that
Mr. Kaczynski would never be able to show that he was
prejudiced by them in any event. In anticipation of these
unsatisfactory responses Kaczynski argues as follows.

On the first point we concede that "it is not asking too
much that the burden of showing essential unfairness be
sustained by him who claims such injustice." United States
v. Handy, 351 U.S. 454, 462, 76 S.Ct. 965, 970 (1956).
But the party who bears such a burden must be given an
adequate opportunity to fulfill it. Thus, if the
government's rejoinder to these papers in any way
suggests that it is not responsible for the lethal media blitz
that has been occurring over the past couple of weeks,
Kaczynski is entitled to an evidentiary hearing to prove
that assertion
wrong. 2

In this connection we would envision calling as witnesses
at such a hearing the media personnel who printed or
reported some of the more egregious stories, to have
them name their government sources in open court.
Furthermore, we anticipate calling as a witness the
Deputy Attorney General of the United States in charge of
the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice to
determine what, if any, measures were taken before the
search warrant was executed, and then later after the leaks
started occurring, to insure that security would be
maintained, vis-a-vis, the evidence and information being
collected during the search.

On the second anticipated government argument
(Kaczynski's inability to show prejudice) we argue that
this case presents a situation where the structural
protections of the grand jury have been so compromised
by the government's misconduct that any remaining
process would be fundamentally unfair, thereby allowing
for a presumption of prejudice. Cases of this ilk are
exemplified by Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U.S. 254, 106
S.Ct. 617 (1986) where it was held that racial
discrimination in selection of grand jurors compelled
dismissal of the indictment. In addition to involving an
error of constitutional magnitude, the court in Vasquez
noted that other remedies were impractical and it could be
presumed that a discriminatorily selected grand jury
would treat the defendant unfairly. In Ballard v. United
States, 329 U.S. 187, 67 S.Ct. 261 (1946) the court
reached a similar conclusion where women had been
excluded from the grand jury. Thus the nature of the
violations in Vasquez and Ballard controlled and allowed
for the presumption of prejudice.

In United States v. Russell, 411 U.S. 423, 431-432, 93
S.Ct. 1637, 1643 (1973) the court observed that
conceivably a situation could one day arise in which "the
conduct of [government] agents is so outrageous that due
process principles would absolutely bar the government
from invoking judicial process to obtain a conviction"
Id.(emphasis added). Thus Kacsynski argues that in
combination Vasquez, Ballard and Russell, provide the
legal framework necessary to warrant the granting of a
hearing on these issues, and to justify serious
consideration of the drastic remedies of dismissal and no
further prosecution that we pray for herein.

CONCLUSION

WHEREFORE, Kaczynski prays that the Court will
entertain this motion in the context of an evidentiary
hearing, and in the meantime prohibit the government
from indicting Mr. Kaczynski in any district in these
United States.

Respectfully Submitted April 14, 1996.

APPENDIX A



GREAT FALLS TRIBUNE, APRIL 4, 1996

Page 1  A member of the Unabom task force, speaking
to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity,
identified the man as Ted John Kaczynski and said he had
been using many aliases.

Page 8A  Rick Smith, who retired just on Friday from
the FBI in San Francisco, headquarters of the Unabom
task force, said the force had half a dozen good suspects
in the case in recent months, and all but one of them
appeared less likely to be the Unabomber as the
investigation continued. The one who became more likely
is the man in Montana, he said. "On this particular
instance, the further we went along the more likely it was
he was a viable suspect. So I think the FBI's fairly certain
they have the right man," he said.

BILLINGS GAZETTE, APRIL 4, 1996

Page 1  Sources told The Gazette federal officials have
"extremely damaging" evidence against 55 year-old Ted
John Kaczynski,....A source close to the case told The
Gazette officials have a document of Kaczynski's written
years ago that mirrors the Unabomber's 35,000-word
manifesto.

THE MONTEREY COUNTY HERALD, APRIL 5,
1996

Page 12A  Federal officials said searchers also found
two manual typewriters. The Unabomber has sent a sheaf
of typed letters over the past few years, and investigators
wantedto compare those with the typewriters.

THE BILLINGS GAZETTE, APRIL 5, 1996

Page 2A  David Kaczynski was torn between duty to
country and loyalty to family before he pointed
investigators toward his older brother as a possible
suspect in the 18-year series of Unabomber attacks,
federal agents said Thursday. Ultimately, Kaczynski got
an acquaintance, a Washington lawyer, to relay his
suspicions to the FBI in early January, according to agents
who requested anonymity.


THE INDEPENDENT RECORD, APRIL 5, 1996

Page 4A  He [Kaczynski] submitted to lengthy questioning
without requesting a lawyer, another federal official
[said].... Noting the lack of electricity at the cabin, agents
said the Unabomber could have built his meticulous
bombs without power tools, one official said.

Page 5A  "We know he was a smashing success
professionally. He graduates from Harvard at the age of
20, gets his Ph.D. in Michigan and then gets a job in the
mathematics department at Berkeley," said Michael
Rustigan, a criminologist at San Francisco State
University who assisted in crafting the investigative
profile used by the Unabom Task Force. "This is
absolutely the premier mathematics department in the
nation and he gets a job there as an assistant professor. He
has one of the most brilliant careers in the country before
him, and then he quits after two years. What happened?
That's the question. What happened?" "This kind of
success is truly an exception for serial killers," Rustigan
said.

Page 8A  The officials denied a CBS News report that
alibi evidence for two bombings had been uncovered.
"Nothing has been found that precludes him from being
the Unabomber," said a senior federal official in
Washington.

Typewriter is a match, says federal official (Headline)

A manual typewriter found in Theodore J. Kaczynski's
shack appears to be the one the Unabomber used to type
his letters and his grand manifesto about the evils of
technology, a federal official said Friday.

Two manual typewrites were taken from the cabin and
were being analyzed at FBI headquarters in Washington,
but "it looks like the manifesto and the letters from the
Unabomber were typed on" one of them, according to the
official in Washington, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. "We'll know for sure after the detailed lab
analysis."

A federal agent speaking on condition of anonymity said
the search of the hand-built 10-by-12 foot cabin was
going slowly for fear of booby traps.


THE NEW YORK TIMES, APRIL 7, 1996

Page 1 Yesterday, investigators trying to connect Mr.
Kaczynski to the bombings determined that, as they had
suspected, he had frequently ridden intercity buses, which
would have allowed him to travel from Montana to both
Utah and Northern California, where the bomber had
been active
since 1981.

Page 13 Federal agents say Theodore Kaczynski lived in
Salt Lake City for a while in the early 1980's - though
city and state agencies there say they have no record of
him - and the bomber's activities shifted there then.

HOUSTON CHRONICLE, APRIL 7, 1996

ABC News reported late Friday that agents found
intricately carved wooden boxes in the shack.

Carved videocassette-sized wooden boxes, sometimes
made from four different woods, were used in some of
the Unabomber's bombs.

The Washington Post Saturday quoted an unnamed
official in Washington as saying they were "99.9 percent
sure" that Kaczynski is the Unabomber, who began his
campaign of terror in 1978 when a person was injured by
a bomb that exploded at Northwestern University in
Evanston, Ill.

In other developments Saturday, U.S. News and World
Report reported that, according to U.S. Department of
Justice sources, Kaczynski had relied on his family to
support him over the years, receiving thousands of dollars
from them. That could explain how a man with no visible
means of support could have traveled the county planting
or mailing bombs.

THE SACRAMENTO BEE, APRIL 7, 1996

So far, Kaczynski has been charged with nothing more
than a single count of possessing bomb components. But
the federal source said investigators who have been
hunting the Unabomber are uncovering a wealth of
information inside his ramshackle hovel and are "150
percent certain" they have their man.

Investigators looked at the documents, including letters
that Kaczynski had written over the years to his mother,
Wanda, and were stunned: They read like an introduction
to the manifesto. "I said, 'This guy either wrote the
manuscript or he is very close to the person who did,'
"said a federal investigator.

Investigators defuse bomb
(Headline)

Investigators discovered and defused a live bomb in the
cabin of Theodore Kaczynski, the former math professor
suspected of being the elusive Unabomber, a federal law
officer said Saturday.

Agents, who have been warily searching Kaczynski's
cabin since he was taken into custody Wednesday believe
the bomb they diffused Friday was intended for someone
in particular, said the official. Authorities now have little
doubt that they have apprehended the man responsible for
placing or mailing bombs that have killed three people
and injured 23 others over the past 18 years, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "I've been
working this case since 1985," he said. "If it isn't him, I
don't know who it is."

Search by FBI yields live bomb
(Headline)

The explosive apparently was intended for a specific
target, said one federal official, refusing to elaborate.

THE MONTANA STANDARD, APRIL 8, 1996

The Chicago Tribune reported Sunday that federal
agents in mid-March searched a shed at the Kaczynski
family home in the Chicago suburb of Lombard, Ill., and
found matches, traces of gunpowder and half-empty
containers of compounds used in making explosive
devices. The newspaper, citing unnamed sources, said
agents also determined that Kaczynski was in the Chicago
area when the first four Unabomber devices were planted
or mailed from there in the late 1970's and early 1980's.

THE SACRAMENTO BEE, APRIL 8, 1996

Federal sources, speaking on a condition of anonymity,
said he [Kaczynski] may have stayed in Northern
California for months at a time.

Federal sources have told The Bee that they are "150
percent" certain that Kaczynski, 53, is the elusive bomber
who has eluded them for almost 18 years.

The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
they have uncovered a "gold mine" of evidence in his
Montana cabin linking him to the bombings, including
manual typewriters they believe may have been used for
typing his 35,000-word anarchistic manifesto.


MISSOULIAN, APRIL 8, 1996

Page 1 Federal agents searching the cabin of former
University of California, Berkeley, math professor
Theodore Kaczynski have found evidence directly
connecting him to at least one of the bombings carried out
by the elusive Unabomber, a source familiar with the
investigation said
Sunday.

Investigators also disclosed Sunday that the bomb
discovered in Kaczynski's cabin over the weekend was not
only fully constructed, but had batteries attached to it - a
key step in the final arming of a bomb.

So linking Kaczynski even to one of the 16 bombs is a
significant step toward connecting him to all - a
connection that investigators are growing increasingly
confident of being able to make. "It's there" said a federal
source, who requested anonymity.

AUSTIN AMERICAN-STATESMAN, APRIL 9, 1996

One official described the similarities between one of the
bombs found in the cabin and one used in a fatal attack as
striking, akin to two cars of the same make and model. "It
was as if once he found the right design, he stuck with it,"
the official said.

NEW YORK POST, APRIL 9, 1996

Page 4 Law-enforcement officials say the former
Berkeley professor is the mastermind behind a 1 7-year
bombing campaign - apparently driven by a hatred of
technology - that killed three people and wounded 23.

GREAT FALLS TRIBUNE, APRIL 10, 1996

Page 1 Sources said investigators have discovered
"something big" in the form of evidence that is more
conclusive than anything yet disclosed.

It took 17 years to arrest a suspect in the Unabomber
attacks, but the book industry isn't waiting that long to
cash in. On April 25, Pocket Books will rush into
publication "Unabomber: On the Trail of America's
Most-Wanted Serial Killer" ($5.99), by former FBI unit
chief John Douglas and Mark Olshaker. The book
recounts the FBI's long pursuit of the elusive Unabomber
from the first of the 16 bombings, which have killed three
and wounded 23, through suspect Theodore Kaczynski's
capture in Montana last week. The book will include
photographs. Douglas, an expert on criminal personality
profiling, created the FBI's first profile of the
Unabomber.

Victim links
Names found in Kaczynski's papers
(Headline)

The names of Unabomber victims have turned up in
Theodore Kaczynski's writings found at his wilderness
cabin, and federal agents have discovered possible causal
contacts between him and four victims, officials said
Tuesday.

"There is a general consistency in the written plans and
the physical evidence found at the cabin scene, with the
Unabomber's work," said a law enforcement official in
Washington, commenting only on conditions of
anonymity. "The names of some victims were found in
the cabin", he said, declining to disclose them or in what
form they appeared.

THE SACRAMENTO BEE, April 10, 1996

Kaczynski is being held on a single charge of possessing
bomb components, but federal sources have said the are
certain he is the Unabomber and more charges will
follow.

Federal sources told The Bee that agents have found a
list of categories of individuals who may have been future
bombing targets - including executives and social
climbers.

"He obviously did not plan to keep his promise (to cease
bombing)," a federal source said.

Federal sources have said they are amassing evidence
that Kaczynski, who lived like a hermit in Montana,
traveled to Northern California and stayed for weeks or
months at [a] time.

Chicago and San Francisco reported on Wednesday. The
Chicago Tribune and San Francisco Examiner, citing an
unidentified law enforcement official, said the shirt and
glasses were found on Tuesday.

NBC Nightly News reported Wednesday that a live
bomb found in Kaczynski's cabin had been wrapped for
mailing and given a phony return address. It had not yet
been addressed to anyone, the network said.

elaboration on evidence already obtained by agents. The
manual typewriter reported by some newspapers to have

Unabomber to his targets, not the manifesto. In addition,
a large number of maps with markings consistent with
Unabomber attack sites were recovered, the source said.

LAW OFFICIALS SAY
WEEK'S HUNT IN MONTANA
Manuscript Adds Crucial Piece to Body of Other
Evidence - Tie to 3rd Typewriter
(Headline)

Page 1 Federal law-enforcement officials said today that
agents searching Theodore J. Kaczynski's Montana cabin
had found the original typewritten manuscript of the
Unabomber's 35,000-word manifesto, a powerful piece of
evidence that has convinced the authorities that they have
the longsought serial terrorist.

"If we lose this one," one law-enforcement official said,
"we'd better close up and go home." The officials said the
manuscript left little room for doubt that Mr. Kaczynski
was the Unabomber. The officials said they believed that
the manuscript found at the cabin was a master copy.
From it, the Unabomber laboriously typed the copies of
the manifesto that he sent to The New York Times and
The Washington Post in June 1995, they said. Moreover,
the officials said that along with the manifesto had been
found an original of a letter sent by the Unabomber to
The Times last year.

Near the manuscript in the loft of the tiny one-room
cabin, agents found a third manual typewriter. The first
two typewrites found did not match the typewriting on the
manuscripts sent to the newspapers, and officials said
today that they were relieved that preliminary tests had
confirmed that the type on the third machine matched the
typewriting of the manuscripts.

The officials said the discovery of the manuscript in the
cabin was a legally significant find in a search that has
already yielded much physical evidence.

Manifesto Found
Unabomber's original treatise uncovered in cabin
(Headline)

Page 1 What appears to be the typed original of the
Unabomber's 35,000-word manifesto has been found in
the cabin of suspect Theodore Kaczynski, a law
enforcement source said Friday. "We have not yet
confirmed it, but it appears to be the original," the source
told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of
anonymity.

U.S. News and World Report said agents told the
magazine the manuscript was indeed the original copy and
was prepared on one of three typewriters removed from
the cabin.

Page 7A A senior federal official in Washington disclosed
earlier this week that all the Unabomber's
communications, including the manifesto, had been typed
on the same typewriter. Investigators believe he did that
deliberately so authorities could authenticate the letters
and rule out
copy-cats.

NEWSWEEK, APRIL 15, 1996

Page 37 Last week, the investigators were forced to move
quickly. From a leak, CBS News had learned about the
stakeout and was threatening to break the story.

What they found inside, reportedly after a brief scuffle
with the reclusive owner, was a do-it-yourself bomb lab.
There were scientific volumes and 10 three-ring binders
full of meticulously drawn bomb diagrams; jars full of
chemicals useful for making explosives; metal ingots that
could be used in explosives; batteries and electrical wiring
for detonators. The agents also found a pair of old manual
typewriters, one of which the Feds believe matches the
typing on the 35,000-word anti-technology screed the
Unabomber mailed to The New York Times and The
Washington Post last June. G-men also discovered and
defused a finished bomb that was all ready to be mailed.

Though Kaczynski has not yet been formally charged in
any of the Unabombings, federal officials are confident
they have the right guy. At last: federal agents had spent
more than $50 million as well as a million work hours
trying to catch the killer.

Page 42 At the Unabom project headquarters in San
Francisco last week, the FBI and ATF agents traded high-
fives. One ATF agent who's been on the case for three
years decided to step out and walk the San Francisco
streets by himself. He had seen the shattered office of the
forestry association official, splattered with body parts,
and he had talked to more fortunate victims who had
merely been injured. Now, as he walked along, he felt "a
huge sense of relief. I thought to myself," he told
Newsweek, "this guy will never kill anyone again."


U.S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT, APRIL 15, 1996

Page 30 Wanda Kaczynski didn't even ask the FBI agents
to get a warrant, so on a brisk day in the middle of
March, the agents conducted what is known as a
consensual search of the residence. "That was really a
treasure-trove," the senior Justice Department official
told U.S. News. "We started analyzing the notes and
letters. [Many] looked like the [Unabomber's 35,000-
word] manifesto. He wrote about all of the same things in,
really, some of the same phrases."

Page 31 ...and after some hurried checking, a
confidential memorandum was forwarded to Attorney
General Janet Reno saying, in the words of one key
official, "this could be the guy."

The evidence was enough for the Unabom task force to
authorize the search of Wanda Kaczynski's home. The
search, investigators say, iced Kaczynski's identification
as the Unabomber. Now all they had to do was arrest him.

Page 32 There was copper pipe of the type the
Unabomber had used in his last four explosive devices.
There was electrical wiring, C-cell batteries and a box the
FBI team was afraid to open; an X-ray machine quickly
identified the contents as a partially constructed pipe
bomb. U.S. News has learned that a subsequent search of
the cabin uncovered a completed bomb, described in a
private Justice Department communication as a "fully
functional device which is yet to be rendered harmless but
which appears to have Unabom characteristics."

Such bomb-making materials alone could not identify
Kaczynski as the Unabomber, but other items recovered
from the cabin made the identification appear to be more
airtight. Ten three-ring binders containing detailed
handwritten notes in Spanish and English closely track the
evolution of the Unabomber's explosive devices,
according to a senior official

TIME, APRIL 15, 1996

Page 40 But when they finally, carefully entered the
cabin, fearing booby traps, they found a whole bomb
factory, including a partially built pipe bomb, chemicals,
wire, books on bombmaking and hand-drawn diagrams.
The cache even included components bearing, a source
told Time, the unique signature of the Unabomber.

END NOTES for Memorandum

1. Later in this memorandum we ask for an evidentiary
hearing so that we can prove to the Court that the
government is responsible for the leaks (see pp 11 and 12
below). Also at that hearing we expect to provide more
detailed statistical information concerning the number,
content and sources of damning stories that have been
published throughout America. Here we note for sake of
emphasis that what we have included in Appendices A and
B is just the proverbial tip of the iceberg, and is only
representative of the proof we expect to bring before the
Court.

2. On the issue of the requirement for a hearing on this
motion see United States v. Handy, 351 U.S. 454, 462, 76
S.Ct. 965, 970 (1956) ("[p]etitioner has been given ample
opportunity to prove that he has been denied due process
of law" based on atmosphere of hysteria and prejudice
resulting from news coverage). And also Wood v.
Georgia, 370 U.S. 375, 387, 82 S.Ct. 1364, 1371 (1962)
(record ``barren'' of findings necessary to support
conclusion that county sheriff interfered with grand jury
process by incendiary public comments). By implication
these cases suggest that upon an adequate initial showing
on issues such as these, an evidentiary hearing and
findings are required.

AFFIDAVIT

STATE OF MONTANA         )
:ss
County of Lewis and Clark)

Your affiant, Special Agent (SA) Donald J. Sachtleben, Federal
Bureau of Investigation, states as follows:

1. I, SA Donald J. Sachtleben, have been a Special Agent for 12
years. I graduated from the FBI Hazardous Devices School and the
FBI Post Blast School. I have investigated bombing cases for 10
years and taught classes on the investigation of improvised explosive
devices (IED). I have participated in the on scene investigation of
bombing cases.

2. On April 3, 1996 your affiant and other agents of the FBI, ATF
and United States Postal Service began the execution of a search warrant
on the residence of Theodore John Kaczynski, located in Lewis and
Clark County. The premises is a one-room cabin, approximately 10
feet by 12 feet with a loft and without electricity or running water. I
am informed by other agents that records of Lewis and Clark County
indicate that this property was purchased by Theodore John
Kaczynski and another person in 1971. I am also informed by other
agents that interview of neighbors revealed that Kaczynski has lived
at this residence by himself since that date.

3. When agents knocked on the door, Theodore John Kaczynski
answered and was removed so that the search could begin. The initial
entry was to ascertain the presence or any explosive devices. The
search of the premises continues at the time of this application for an
arrest warrant. The items described herein are based only on a
preliminary search and there remains a considerable amount of items
to be located and reviewed.

4. I personally participated in the search. As set forth in more detail
below, during the search I observed chemicals and other materials
that, in my opinion, are designed and intended for use in
manufacturing a destructive device, namely a pipe bomb, and from
which a destructive device could be readily assembled, including
what appears to be a partially completed pipe bomb. I also observed
notebooks that contain what I recognize to be diagrams and notes that
are consistent with the manufacture of destructive devices such as
pipe bombs.

5. In order to construct a pipe bomb, one needs either a commercially
manufactured explosive or an improvised explosive, a casing, a
device to detonate the explosive, and a power source for the detonating
device. During the search I observed materials from which all of
these could be made. In particular, during the search I observed the
following:

1. Ten three-ring binders, which have been partially reviewed. These
binders contain page after page of meticulous writings and sketches
which I recognize to be diagrams of explosive devices. These
diagrams depict cross-sections of pipes and electrical circuitry
commonly used in the construction of such devices. In addition, they
contain sketches of boxes which could be used to contain, conceal
and transport explosive devices. The notebooks also contain hand-written
notes in Spanish and English which describe, in part, chemical
compounds which can be used in various combinations to create
explosive charges for use in explosive devices. After consultation
with an FBI chemist, it appears that the notes reflect the proper
proportions for such mixtures. From investigation from other FBI agents I am
aware that Theodore John Kaczynski is able to write Spanish.

2. Pipes that appear to be galvanized metal, copper and plastic. Four
of the copper pipes had plates affixed to one end, which is one of the
first steps in the construction of a pipe bomb. I did not observe any
indoor plumbing or any other apparent structural need for such
piping on the premises.

3. Containers containing powders labeled as "KC103" (potassium
chlorate), "NaC103" (sodium chlorate), "Sugar", "Zinc",
"Aluminum", "Lead" and "Silver Oxide". Necessary ingredients in
the preparation of explosives include an oxidizer and a fuel. Sugar, zinc,
aluminum, lead and silver oxide all can serve as fuels, and potassium
chlorate or sodium chlorate can be oxidizers. For example, potassium
chlorate can be combined with either aluminum or sugar to create an
explosive material. Similarly, sodium chlorate can be combined with
aluminum to create an explosive.

4. Solid cast ingots, one of which is labelled aluminum. I observed
on the floor shiny metal filings consistent with aluminum. Aluminum
can be used as an additional fuel and a catalyst in an explosive mixture.

5. C cell batteries and electrical wire. From my experience I am
aware that these materials can be used to provide the power for a device
used to detonate explosive material such as the mixtures described above.

6. Three rolled-up pieces of paper attached to one another, containing
what appear to be logs of experiments to determine the optimum pipe
dimension and combination of explosive materials in various weather
conditions.

7. During a preliminary search of the loft, a package was located.
Visual examination determined that it was a cylindrical package
wrapped in paper and secured with tape. An X-ray of the package
revealed what appears to me to be a partially completed pipe bomb,
including threaded pipe, wire and other electrical components.

8. Several books including ones on the construction of electrical
circuitry and chemistry.

9. Numerous tools, including mechanical drills, drill bits, hack saw
blades, wire cutters, and a roll of solder, all of which would be
necessary to convert the materials I have described above into a pipe
bomb.

6. Based upon my experience in the investigation of the use of
destructive devices, my examination of the above-described
materials, and my review of the writings and sketches in the binders, it is my
opinion that these components were designed to be, could be, and
were intended to be readily assembled into a destructive device such
as a pipe bomb. In my opinion, the premises contained all of the
necessary ingredients and materials to manufacture such a destructive
device.

7. A search was conducted by ATF on April 4, 1996 of the National
Firearms Registration and Transfer Record. That search failed to
locate any record of Theodore John Kaczynski having authorization
for the possession or manufacture of a destructive device.

Developments in the war crimes trial of Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic from May 7-10, 1996.<p>


MAY 7<br>
Today in The Hague, history was made and a trial began.<p>

The first international war crimes trial since the end of World War II will attempt to determine whether Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic is guilty of atrocities ranging from murder and sexual assault to crimes against humanity.<p>

The trial, likely to take months with over 100 witnesses, will focus on alleged crimes by Serbs against Moslems and Croats at Omarska and other places in the Prijedor area of northern Bosnia. Created by the Security Council in May 1993, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia marks the first attempt by the United Nations to enforce international treaties on the conduct of war and protection of civilians. <p>


The proceedings opened with Judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald gently reminding the lawyers to be on their best behavior. "Be at ease," she told them, "but discharge your  responsibilities in a professional manner."<p>


In addition to Judge McDonald, a U.S. law professor and federal court jurist, Tadic will be judged by Sir Ninian Stephen of Australia and Datuk Lal Vohrah of Malaysia. There is no jury, but defendants can challenge a ruling by one of the two trial chambers before a separate appeals body. Tadic is one of 57 people charged with war crimes by the tribunal but one of only three held in its 24 jail cells.<p>


Then prosecutor Grant Niemann began his opening argument by saying, "what man has done to man in the former Yugoslavia strains the most agile capacities of human reason."<p>


The prosecutor then sketched the historical circumstances surrounding the Bosnian conflict. He sought to emphasize the manner in which the Serbian authorities in the former Yugoslavia manipulated the army and the political structure to seize power and territory. Next, he spelled out the prosecution's understanding of how Serbs in Bosnia "cleansed" the territory of non-Serbs. There were, he said, careful preparations, a sudden coup, martial law, then terror, torture, rape, murder and the driving out of the non-Serb populations. <p>


Niemann then addressed the scene of the crimes -- Opstina Prijedor, the county in northern Bosnia where Tadic and the alleged victims lived. He detailed the command structure of the Yugoslavian National Army (JNA) which ran operations in that part of the country. <p>


Then, he got to Tadic. <p>


The prosecution has a problem in that Tadic was not openly involved in the radical Serb elements in his hometown of Kozarac. So Niemann offered a theory: Tadic was a secret agent, just waiting for his masters to seize power so he could exercise his sadistic anti-Muslim instincts.<p>


Niemann claimed Tadic "emerged from his undercover role" and fired flares into the night sky on May 23-24, 1992, when the JNA shelled Kozarac. He also, Niemann said, helped round up his Muslim neighbors in the succeeding days, even murdering one of his best friends.<p>


Then came the camps, and another problem for the prosecution. Whatever else these camps were, they were officially established. Tadic, the prosecution admits, had no official position enabling him to enter these top-secret institutions, so ho did he commit all the crimes? Niemann implied Tadic was a hired sadist, an expert torturer brought in to assist the terror squads and train the killing teams. <p>


"His position was one of importance and trust," the prosecutor said. "He seemed to be in a superior position to guards and perhaps even commanders."<p>


Niemann outlined Tadic's alleged crimes one by one. As he did so, the defendant, who was sitting rather impassively, began sighing, shaking his head and taking notes. <p>


Niemann said prosecutors will call up to 80 witnesses. The trauma they have suffered and the passage of time, he said, "may sometimes prevent the neat dovetailing of all the evidence." He went on, "it is almost beyond human capacity to witness such appalling torture" and keep all the stories straight.<p>


In his opening remarks, defense attorney Michail Wladimiroff first challenged the tribunal. He told the judges that the question of whether Tadic can get a fair trial is an open one and the search for a scapegoat and the historical pressures in the trial must be resisted. <p>


"The tribunal has not been established to satisfy victims," he said. "The tribunal must be wary of the desire for revenge and the need for a scapegoat ...The thirst for revenge must not be satisfied at the well of polluted justice."<p>


Much of the first part of his opening statement was a complaint. He listed the obstacles to mounting a decent defense for his client. Most importantly, he told the court that the situation in northern Bosnia made defending Tadic almost impossible.<p>


All of the prosecution witnesses are refugees living outside the former Yugoslavia. All the defense witnesses live in the Serbian entity in that war-torn land, Republica Srpksa. The civil order in the northern Bosnia region has been replaced by a kind of fiefdom, ruled by a man named Simo Drljac.<p>


And Drljac is the kind of man, according to numerous government sources,  who thrives in the madness of war. He has built his power through what is practically a private army -- the police of Opstina Prijedor. Since the war stopped last year, many discharged soldiers looking for regular pay have swelled the ranks of Drljac's men.<p>


And people are afraid of him. <p>


Wladimiroff quoted "one high-ranking official in northern Bosnia who told him: "No one can order me to allow witnesses for the defense to my interviewed in my area ... No witnesses can make a statement without my permission."<p>


And that is the problem for the defense. All their witnesses live in the area controlled by Drjlac and he does not want the tribunal on his turf.<p>


Wladimiroff then addressed why Drjlac would not want to help a fellow Serb.<p>


Tadic did not commit the crimes, he said. Another man who looks just like Tadic did them. That other man works for Drljac.<p>


Wladimiroff did say that Tadic is viewed by many Serbs in Bosnia as a deserter and draft dodger who escaped the fighting by landing a job as a reserve traffic police officer in Prijedor. Because of his refusal to fight, Tadic has been abandoned by his people, Wladimiroff claims. <p>


And the people who have come forward against Tadic are wrong, he continued. Wladimiroff noted the intense psychological and political pressures on the witnesses. The defense contends that many of the corroborating stories about Tadic were picked up in the media, or passed down from person to person in the refugee communities. <p>


As far as an alibi is concerned, Wladimiroff told the court that the defense will try to present witnesses who were with Tadic on most of the days in question and back up those claims with documents -- duty rosters and time-cards from his job. The defense also is trying to get the testimony of guards or others who worked at the Omarska camp.<p>


Wladimiroff ended his opening statement by returning to the fairness question. "We are standing on the edge of a fair trial," he told the court. "Please do not push us over...If you enable us, if you enable our witnesses to testify, you will not convict Dusko Tadic."<p>


MAY 8<br>

The testimony of the first witness, University of London war studies professor James Gow, is important for establishing the elements of some of the crimes with which Dusko Tadic is charged.<p>


Tadic is charged under three broad categories of crimes:  grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, crimes against humanity and violations of the laws and customs of war.<p>


Gow's testimony is the start of the prosecutions efforts to answer some of the following:  What makes a murder a crime against humanity? What makes a brutal interrogation torture and therefore a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions? Who is bound by the laws and customs of war, and who is protected by them?<p>


<b>Grave Breaches</b><br>
The Geneva Conventions of 1949 were originally agreements among states to behave when they went to war against each other. The conventions prohibit the following acts: willful killing; torture and inhuman treatment including biological experiments; willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health; extensive destruction and appropriation of property not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly; compelling a prisoner of war to civilian to serve in the forces of a hostile power; unlawful deportation or transfer or unlawful confinement of a civilian and the taking of civilians as hostages.<p>


But the law only applies when the acts are committed by persons linked to a party of a conflict or an occupying power against persons protected by the Conventions. <p>


So the question arises: who were Tadic's alleged victims? His neighbors or protected persons? Thats one of the questions the prosecution is trying to answer through Gow's testimony.<p>


Under the Geneva Conventions, protected persons are defined as prisoners of war and civilians who, in the event of a conflict or an occupation, find themselves in the hands of a party to the conflict or occupying power of which they are not nationals.<p>

Lets say the United States goes to war against Mexico. Its pretty clear who protected persons are under the convention:  Mexicans on one side of the border, Americans on the other side. But Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia is a more complicated question. <p>


The issue of nationality is a mixed question of law and fact to be answered at trial, according to prosecutors in the Tadic case.<p>


Gow says Serbia destroyed Yugoslavia. He sees the raw nationalism of the Serbian people and the lust for power of Slobodan Milosevic as the driving force behind the break-up of the country, the start of the war and the perpetration of war crimes.<p>


This is important in the Tadic case because, after Slovenia, Croatia and then Bosnia-Herzegovina declared independence and were recognized by the world community, they were sovereign nations, and the citizens were protected by the Geneva Conventions against any foreign armed force or occupying power -- like say, Serbia.<p>


Gow says the war in Bosnia was launched and directed by the military and political leadership in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia and of the new Yugoslavia. He says what in effect happened was that the Serb-dominated Yugoslavian National Army (the JNA) teamed up with local Serb militias and waged war against the independent state of Bosnia. If he is right, the war in Bosnia was an international armed conflict, not a civil war, and Tadic was working hand-in-glove with an occupying power, a foreign armed force.<p>


Gow's proof lies in the numerous speeches, documents and even memoirs of the major participants, as well as the order of battle and movement through territory of the JNA itself. Gow says the comments of Serb leaders in Belgrade prove that they wanted to create a Greater Serbia by ripping out of the map of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina those territories where Serbs lived in large numbers, cleansing them of non-Serbs and attaching them to the country calling itself Yugoslavia. It was a simple land-grab, he says. <p>


But theres another version of this history that the defense will no doubt rely on. In this version, the welling up of nationalist feeling in Croatia especially but also in Bosnia-Herzegovina, threatened the security of hundreds of thousands of Serbs whose families had lived there for centuries. And it was no idle threat. The Croatian fascist regime in World War II liquidated hundreds of thousands of Serbs. And some of the first things the Croatian nationalist party did in the 1990s when it came to power was restore the flag of the fascist regime, restore the police uniforms, re-name schools and streets after the leadership of the regime, and change the constitution to alter the status of Serbs living there. <p>


In Bosnia, the rise of Alija Izebetgovic's Muslim nationalist party also frightened the Serbs living there. Serbs always point to Izebetgovic's writings, in which he suggests that Islam ought to know no secular boundaries. Bosnia-Herzegovina ought to become part of the international Islamic revolution. <p>


So the defense will argue that what happened in Bosnia was the rising up of native Bosnian Serbs against a regime they didnt like. Any JNA troops in Bosnia who helped them were just the Bosnian-Serb element of the JNA coming to the defense of their people.<p>


Crimes Against Humanity
Gow's testimony concerning the other two categories of crimes in which Tadic is charged track his testimony relevant to "graves breaches," with significant differences.<p>


There are the crimes against humanity the tribunal is empowered to judge:  murder; extermination; enslavement; deportation; imprisonment; torture; rape; persecutions on political, racial and religious grounds, and other inhumane acts. <p>


The tribunal only has jurisdiction over these crimes -- can only convict Tadic of murder, say -- if it finds they were committed in armed conflict, whether international or internal in character, and directed against any civilian population.To show Tadic's crimes were directed against any civilian population, prosecutors must show that at the time of the commission of the accused's acts...there was ongoing a widespread and systematic attack directed against a civilian population, and that Tadic knew or had reason to know that by his acts he was participating in the attack.<p>


<b>Violations of the Laws or Customs of War</b><br>
Tadic is charged with the following violations of the laws or customs of war:  murder; cruel treatment; plunder or pillage of public or private property.<p>


The laws and customs of war is a kind of catch-all for bad deeds done during battle. There are some specific laws of war -- like the Hague Conventions of 1907 -- but the customs of war are more vague.<p>


The prosecution in the Tadic case must show a nexus between the crimes and an armed conflict for them to constitute violations of the laws and customs of war. This is easier than it sounds. The geographical and temporal frame of reference is broad, according to the Appeals Chamber of the tribunal. The chamber ruled on the matter last year.<p>


So all the prosecution has to do is show that Tadic committed these acts while war was going on nearby at roughly the same time.<p>


MAY 9<br>
The direct examination of James Gow concluded today, with the prosecution's expert witness getting to the heart of his version of history, and the prosecution's theory of the context of the case against Dusko Tadic.<p>


Gow discussed what happened in Bosnia-Herzegovina between 1991 and 1994. Once again, his conclusion was conspiratorial:  After the declaration of independence by the Muslim-led government in Sarajevo in March 1992, and the recognition of the state as an equal among nations in the world, Serbs from within and without her borders set upon her and sought to tear her apart, all at the direction and behest of authorities in Belgrade, especially Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.<p>


Gow once again backed up his contention by the words, official documents and actions of Serbian leaders. The most chilling moment of the day came in the videotape clip of a notorious speech by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic in the Bosnian parliament, a speech in which Karadzic can be understood to be threatening genocide. "You Muslims are not ready for war," he said. "If it comes, it will mean your extinction." The videoclip was another piece of evidence from the British documentary Gow helped to produce,  "Death of Yugoslavia."<p>


When Bosnia-Herzegovina declared independence, Karadzic and the rest of the Serbian nationalists withdrew from parliament, reconvened in Banja Luka, and declared their own state, the "Republica Srpksa," which Gow noted ominously, considered itself linked to Belgrade as "part of the territory of Yugoslavia."  Once again, the prosecution contends, a foreign power was making war on Bosnia, bringing all the force of international law into play.<p>


But there was another purpose to Gow's testimony, one referring to Tadic. It emerged as the witness discussed what happened once war began, and it dovetailed nicely with prosecutor Grant Niemann's opening statement.<p>


<b>Planned Takeover</b><br>
Serbs planned a military and political takeover of vast portions of Bosnia, Gow contended. They did so by careful planning and preparation, in the army and on the ground.<p>


The Yugoslavian People's Army (the JNA) was fighting Croatia throughout most of 1991. Bosnia was a major base of operations. As the Croatian war came to a close, the JNA pulled back through Bosnia. When it became clear that Bosnia was going to secede, Belgrade began sending in every Serb officer and enlisted man born in Bosnia into the JNA forces there. Then, on May 4, 1992, under intense international pressure, Belgrade ordered the JNA out of Bosnia -- but allowed Bosnian Serb personnel to remain in the country, fully armed.<p>

The effect of this was, according to prosecutors and Gow, to establish on the territory on an independent state of Bosnia-Herzegovina a fully equipped army operating  at the behest of a foreign power. That's why the early stages of the war went so horribly for the Muslims. They were fighting not just their neighbors but an occupying army. <p>

That's the army prong of Gow's Serbian conspiracy theory. The other two prongs dealt more closely with Tadic:  paramilitaries and a shadow Bosnian Serb government, a "fifth column."<p>

<b>The Role of Paramilitaries</b><br>
Gow says that the military actions of the JNA were closely coordinated with paramilitary irregular forces and with local Serbs who would take power once the legitimate Muslim authorities were cleaned out. The paramilitaries were directed by several radical Serb leaders in Belgrade. They recruited Serbs throughout Bosnia and they went house to house cleaning Muslims out of the towns.<p>

Prosecutors have not claimed that Tadic was in the paramilitaries, but given the manner in which they describe his role in the Serb takeover of northern Bosnia, it's clear they will contend he was working closely with them. Tadic, prosecutors allege, was armed secretly. He helped round up Muslims in his hometown of Kozarac and he provided lists of names  of prominent Muslims who were selected for liquidation later.<p>

Gow also claimed that Serbs had, lying in wait for the military attack, secret shadow governments of local Serbs who would replace the Muslim civil authorities once victory was secured. Here too, his general description of what happened coincides with the prosecution's claims about the defendant. Tadic did indeed become an official in Kozarac after the battle of  May 23-24, 1992, and the defeat and "cleansing" of the Muslims. <p>

<b>Defense Seeks Freer Access to Tadic</b><br>
The defense filed a motion asking the court to order the registry, the neutral, administrative arm of the tribunal, to allow defense experts to meet privately with Tadic in the holding cell in the courthouse. The Registry, for security purposes, had sought to draw a line between counsel and witnesses when it came to private access to Tadic. Judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald ordered that the access be granted, as long as lawyers were present with the experts and no more than four people were in the cell with Tadic at one time.<p>

MAY 10<br>
The court was not in session.<p>

Developments in the war crimes trial of Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic from May 13-17, 1996.<p>

MAY 13<br>
Today we were transported from the academic, metaphysical gyrations of Dr. James Gow to the phantasmagorical account of Dragan Lukac, a senior security official in a northern Bosnian town. <p>

But the differences between these witnesses did not mask the fact that they were called to serve the same strategic functions for the prosecution: to establish that this was an international conflict in order to prove "grave breaches" against Tadic, and to show that Tadic's alleged crimes were part of a "widespread and systematic" attack on a civilian population, thereby constituting "crimes against humanity." <p>


If the Tribunal believes these two witnesses, then the prosecution will have little difficulty in hurtling these jurisdictional barriers. However, prosecutor Nieman has promised at least a dozen more witnesses on these same issues. <p>

<b>Continued Cross-Examination of James Gow</b><br>
Defense counsel Alphons Orie attacked Gow's position on both jurisdictional issues while simultaneously launching an assault on the professor's accuracy. He began with questions about U.N. Resolution 757. (On May 30, 1992, shortly after the commencement of the spring offensive in northern Bosnia, the U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 757, calling for an embargo of Serbia and Montenegro. One of the articulated bases for this resolution was the refusal of Serbia to withdraw the JNA from Bosnia.) <p>


Orie asked Gow if he knew what facts the security council had when it passed this resolution. Gow replied that he did not but he assumed that there had been a "reliable factual basis." Orie then produced a fax of a Secretary General's report, from which he read several passages that, if true, would contradict Gow's testimony that the offensive was being masterminded from Belgrade. How would Gow respond to those, he asked? After some academic circumlocution, Gow was able to justify his prior testimony and offer his own interpretation of the Secretary General's report. This series of questions would have gone further, but Judge Stephen became somewhat testy when Orie tried to read more passages from the report into the record. <p>


<b>Karadzic's Infamous Speech</b><br>
On October 14, 1991, Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, made a speech in the Bosnian Parliament in which he said, "You Muslims will drag Bosnia down to hell. You could face extinction." During direct testimony Gow had guessed that this speech was made in March 1992. Gow readily admitted his mistake but said that the essence was the same. Orie, however, tried to get Gow to concede that there was a difference between language used in the heat of a debate about Bosnia's self-determination (the earlier) and words spoken on the eve of what we know now to be the "ethnic cleansing" campaign (the later). Gow was adamant and insisted that the Serbo-Croation words Karadzic used mean, literally, "non-existence." <p>


Orie also fired a few shots at the professor over references during his testimony to a film called The Death of Yugoslavia, to which Gow was a consultant. Among other things, Orie focused on a section of the film in which some of Milosevic's words seem to have been mistranslated. Gow did ultimately concede that point but claimed that as a consultant he was not responsible for the missed nuances. <p>


<b>Gow's Impact</b><br>
Orie made a game effort of his first cross-examination. He did land some blows on a tough witness under difficult circumstances. But it is hard to believe that the Tribunal doubts that Serbia had a hand in northern Bosnia at least through May of 1992, or that there was a "widespread and systematic" ethnic cleansing campaign against Croats and Muslims in parts of Bosnia. All of which raises the question of why the defense bothered with this witness, since Tadic has entered an alibi. <p>


<b>The Direct of Dragan Lukac</b><br>
In July 1991 Lukac, a Bosnian Croat, was a senior security official in the town of Bosanski Samac, in northern Bosnia near the Croat border. In today's testimony Lukac outlined the process by which the Bosnian Serbs, led by the JNA and other personnel from Serbia, established a parallel security apparatus in his town and then proceeded in early April 1992 to arrest, beat and kill Croatian and Muslim men in his district. <p>


Lukac's testimony began matter-of-factly. But as he spoke, the tension in his voice suggested what was to come. He described how the JNA took all the weapons from the district's arsenal, how they demolished 23 buildings and facilities. Though they tried, Lukac said, it was impossible to arrest anyone -- in fact, the JNA used these incidents as a pretext for its continued presence, claiming to be concerned about "inter-ethnic" tension. <p>


Lukac said he learned in December 1991 of the establishment of a Serb Parliament in Bosanski Samac, which constrasted sharply with his description of a delicately balanced power sharing among ethnic groups in the official Municipal Counsel and security forces. <p>


On February 29, 1992, all of Bosnia was scheduled to participate in a referendum on Bosnian self-determination. One day earlier the JNA blew up the bridge over the Saba River to prevent Croatians from crossing the border to vote. Lukac went on to describe the mounting tensions and conflicts between the two factions. <p>


<b>Gunfire in the Morning</b><br>
At 2:20 a.m. on April 17, 1992, Lukac was awakened by automatic gunfire. He tried to investigate but his phone was cut off. He realized that the JNA and the Serb paramilitary forces had taken Bosanski Samac. His own residence came under sniper fire and he hid out with a neighbor. He tried to escape but was arrested at a roadblock by a policeman wearing a beret and the Serbian "tri-color." <p>


After several days in detention Lukac and about 50 other Croats and Muslims were taken to a 12-by-6-foot room in the old weapon storage facility in Bosanski Samac. Shortly after his internment a Serbian called "Luka" -- now known to be Slobodan Milkovic, subsequently indicted by the Tribunal -- beat the new arrivals, including Lukac, with a truncheon. Lukac testified that the men were beaten regularly by their captors with rifle butts, metal pipes, batons and military boots. When Lukac asked why, he was told he was a "political prisoner." <p>


Sometime after May 7 all but four prisoners were loaded on trucks to be taken elsewhere. When Lukac inquired after the fate of the four left behind, he was told that they were to be used for a prisoner exchange. Lukac later learned that two of the men had been executed.<p>


MAY 14<br>
Testimony was only taken for half a day today because of a closed morning session in which this trial chamber addressed matters concerning Zdravko Mucic. Mucic is charged with offenses committed when he, Zejnil Delalic and Hazim Delic held "positions of superior authority" in Celebici camp in central Bosnia. Celebici was jointly administered by Muslims and Croats; its inmates were Serbs. <p>


Today began on the same note that sounded yesterday's recess. Judge McDonald pressed prosecutor Nieman to streamline his case. Nieman repeated his claim that with his legal burden and the lack of precedent, he had to present all of the proofs available. Apparently in an earlier letter to the Court he identified 14 "policy" witnesses he intended to call, of a total of 88 "certain" witnesses. The "policy" in question is presumably ethnic cleansing. <p>


Today we completed the testimony of two of those "policy" witnesses, Dragan Lukac and Sulejman Tihic. Once again, the defendant was never mentioned, but the prosecution moved ever closer to showing that this was an international conflict and that there was a "systematic and widespread" assault on "protected persons." The defense chose not to cross-examine either witness. <p>


Word of Lukac's dramatic testimony had obviously reached the outside world -- the press corps quintupled overnight. Those who came hoping for a rerun of yesterday's tale of murder, mayhem and carnage in northern Bosnia got their money's worth. <p>


<b>The Lukac Saga Continues</b><br>
Yesterday ended with Lukac telling how he and other prisoners were taken from Bosanski Samac to Birtcko, another northern Bosnian town, in trucks on May 2. From Birtcko they were transferred to Bjalina, a nearby military facility. When they arrived they were confronted with two armored personnel carriers and two tanks. One Muslim prisoner was singled out for no apparent reason and shot by the tank's machine gun. <p>


Lukac was then taken to the gym and beaten and kicked all day. <p>


On May 3 Lukac and six other political prisoners at Bjalina were taken by helicopter to a military facility outside of Belgrade, Serbia. (Also on the helicopter: three prisoners from Bosanski Samac and a coffin draped with Serb flags.) In prison cells there, the inmates were forced to stand from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. They were also forced to sing Chetnik songs and kiss the picture of Draza Mihailovic, a World War II Serbian hero. With considerable emotion Lukac explained that he was forced to make the sign of the cross the Eastern Orthodox way (with three fingers), rather than the full-hand method used by Roman Catholics. <p>


Lukac was returned from Serbia on May 23, where he was held in and about the police station in Bosinski Samac until he was exchanged for Serbian prisoners on September 4, 1992, in a location on the Zagreb-Belgrade motorway under the supervision of ICRC and UNPROFOR. At the time of his release he was 55 pounds lighter than his pre-detention weight, and he had sustained a fractured skull, broken ribs and missing teeth. <p>


<b>Muslim and Croat Alike</b><br>
The next witness on the stand was Sulejman Tihic, a Muslim lawyer and judge from Bosanski Samac. He too saw the construction of a parallel Serbian security structure in 1991 and early 1992. He also heard the sound of weapons at 2 a.m. on April 17, 1992 and saw his town occupied by Serbian forces. <p>


Tihic was slighter in build than Lukac and spoke with more emotion. But for those and other minor differences in detail, his testimony and Lukac's were identical. <p>


Both frequently resorted to words like "indescribable" and "unspeakable," and each said from time to time that what they had experienced could not be envisioned by one who had not been present. Ironically, though they had to have known each other before April 17 and appear to have taken the same helicopter ride with the Serbian corpse from Bjalina to Serbia, neither mentioned the other during testimony. <p>


When firing began on April 17 Lukac joined a Muslim neighbor. One would think that Tihic's luck would have been better since he sought sanctuary from a Serb friend. However, after one day Tihic and his Serbian protector were arrested. Tihic went to the same T.O. facility where he was also beaten by Luga (aka Milkovic). Again, he and other prisoners were beaten badly and forced to sing Chetnik songs. At one point Tihic thought he had arranged to purchase his freedom for 20,000 Deutsch marks, but the money was taken and he remained a prisoner. <p>


Eventually Tihic too followed the trail to Birtcko. He later learned that the troops there were prepared to beat his group as they alighted from their trucks but decided that they looked too badly injured to beat, he said. Then they went from Birtcko to Bjalina, where, upon disembarking, their captors "singled out somebody and shot him." It is impossible to know whether this is the same individual about whom Lukac testified or whether it was standard operating procedure to shoot one prisoner from every lot on arrival. <p>


At Bjalina, where Tihic stayed for six days, he was beaten. Tihic was also forced to clean toilets with this hands. Despite the lack of detergent he was required to get the toilets white in order to avoid more beatings. <p>


From Bjalina to Serbia outside Belgrade he was taken by the helicopter. There he stood from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. and sang "Chetnik songs and kiss[ed] the picture of Draza Mihailovic, a World War II Serbian hero." He was also beaten until his urine turned red and was forced to beat other prisoners as they were forced to beat him. He saw an American and Croatian prisoner there who were beaten badly and forced to "take their penises in each other's mouths." He saw another man who had apparently shot several Serbs endure an "unimaginable beating." Then "Judge Tihic" was forced to "sentence" the man, after which the man was shot. <p>


Tihic was also forced to lie to ICRC representatives (when they weren't being watched by guards they were vulnerable to informers). The captors used electric batons -- possibly cattle prods --  to persuade Tihic and Ized Izetbegovic, a cousin of Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic, to make propaganda videotapes for the Serbs to give to the BBC. His injuries on release were similar to Lukac's. En route to the prisoner exchange which resulted in Tihic's freedom, the bus would stop periodically to allow Serb JNA personnel to get on and beat the captives. <p>


MAY 15<br>
"Apres Moi Le Deluge."<p>


There is no evidence that Marshal Tito ever said these words. However, this fear guided his actions for much of his reign and clearly dominated the last years of his life. But Tito could not find a way to posthumously  hold off the flood waters of resurgent nationalism.<p>


James Gow testified about the changes Tito made in the Constitution of 1974 and of his maintenance of careful ethnic balance among conscripts and the general staff of the Yugoslavian national Army (JNA). We also know that he periodically purged the Communist Party of nationalist elements. These steps were attempts to counteract the anticipated effects of ethnic rivalry after his death.<p>


We now know that he failed. Shortly after his death the Yugoslav pot began to simmer, stirred by committed nationalists and opportunists. The pot finally boiled over at the 14th Extraordinary Congress of the Yugoslav Communist Party in January of 1990. This fractious gathering saw Slovenia and Croatia make their preparations for departure. The Congress also marked the end of the communist party's monopoly of political power and paved the way for multi-party elections.<p>


The elections which took place in April 1990 reflect one of the great ironies of the current Balkan quagmire. They also provide the backdrop for understanding the witnesses who testified today. The elections gave power to nationalist elements backing Tudjiman in Croatia and Milosevic in Serbia. However, they apparently had a different impact in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Each of the five policy witnesses called so far has testified that after the elections, power sharing arrangements were deftly structured in Northern Bosnia, disturbing political and security positions among competing groups.<p>


The Croat Dragan Lukac and Muslims Sulejman Tihic, Isak Gasi, Fadil Redzic and Ibro Osmonovic all testified to the parceling out of key positions based on their respective electoral successes of the competing elements. Each testified that this delicate balance was subsequently upset by the increased presence of the JNA in the region.<p>


The JNA build up resulted from the use of Northern Bosnia as a staging area for the JNA incursion into Croatia in June of 1991 and its withdrawal in November. Today, the witnesses described in the detail the role of the JNA in insuring that Bosnian Serbs obtained a virtual monopoly on weapons by the spring of 1992. This action destroyed the balance of power which had been constructed after the April 1990 elections. <p>


<b>And What Kind of Uniforms Were They Wearing?</b><br>
The prosecutor, U.S. Air Force Col. Brenda Hollis, asked each witness to identify personnel distributing arms to Serbs, manning roadblocks, committing atrocities or guarding camps. The descriptions ranged from "JNA" and "JNA reserve" to a wide selection of military haberdashery styles. Almost all of the variations on the season's camouflage line adorned with matching insignia or caps or one of another of the paramilitary united linked to Serbia.<p>


Each of the witnesses had sufficient military experience to be able to identify units, uniforms and insignia. For instance, Gasi, a world class canoeist, had been a "driver, a simple soldier in a traffic unit" in 1977-78. This enabled him to identify JNA vehicles when they were used to transport prisoners as well as JNA small arms, uniforms and insignia.  His travels throughout the country as an athlete as well as  his sojourn as a student in Serbia in 1979 wee offered by the prosecutor to explain his ability to recognize Serbian accents and slogans amongst his captors and occupiers of his town.<p>


Fadil Redzic had the most impressive credentials for the prosecution's purpose today. He received a reserve commission in 1966 as an artillery officer in the JNA and served with the JNA reserve until forced out with other Muslim officers in December of 1991. He said he saw JNA troops removing weapons from the reserve arsenal and redistributing them to Serb civilians. He said that none were given to Muslims. <p>


Redzic also was familiar with senior military officers in the region and indicated that by the winter of 1991 the entire command structure of his 359th Brigade consisted of Serbs. <p>


Rounding out the trio of witnesses was Osmonovic, a mechanic from  Vlasenica who had served in Montenegro as part of a reconnaissance  in 1984-85. He too identified uniforms, insignia and weaponry in a manner supporting the prosecution's theory that the JNA participated directly  in the April/May 1992 attack on Muslims and Croats, and supplied, supported and guided actions of the paramilitary units which committed atrocities and manned the camps.<p>

Developments in the war crimes trial of Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic from May 20-24, 1996<p>

MAY 20<br>
The big news today was not from The Hague but from Pale, the capital of Republika Srpska, where endless intrigue and speculation surrounds Radovan Karadzic. Will he wind up here at the International Criminal Tribunal defending himself against charges of genocide? Or will he remain the power behind the Bosnian Serb government.<p>

The international and local press have continued to headline events from Bosnia and the Former Yugoslavia. The infighting has intensified between Karadzic's "nationalist hard-liners" and more moderate elements surrounding Prime Minister Rajko Kasagic, based in Banja Luka. Last Thursday, Karadzic fired Kasagic amid press speculation that Karadzic's continued visible presence in the Bosnian Serb government might force NATO troops to arrest him and turn him over to the tribunal. Kasagic was reported to have met with tribunal prosecutors. The international community responded to Kasagic's ouster by saying that the dismissal was a "coup" against the Dayton Agreement.<p>


However, today's London Times carried a front page story entitled, "Defiant Karadzic Clings to Power," accompanied by a picture of Bjiljana Plavsic, a Karadzic ally named to replace Kasagic. Nonetheless, the International Herald tribune quoted an extremely optimistic monitor, Carl Bildt, who claimed that Karadzic "will step out of public life and not be seen or heard."  These beliefs about Karadzic's political demise were based on talks between international mediators and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade, and contacts with Karadzic's political opponents in Pale.<p>


Meanwhile, sources say that those close to the trial would like to see Karadzic in custody. He is at the top of the current prosecution hit list. The judges believe his trial would enhance the credibility of the tribunal, and the defense thinks Dusko Tadic's chances of acquittal or mistrial would increase if Karadzic was locked up. <p>


<b>"Plus Ca Change, Plus La Meme Chose"</b><br>
Meanwhile, the trial continued with the prosecution drawing down the curtain on its Northern Bosnia policy witnesses with Elvir Pasic, a Muslim refugee from Rogaltica. Pasic was a former military and reserve policeman whose testimony followed that of previous witnesses.<p>


He also observed the steady increase in Serb political and paramilitary aggressiveness beginning in the summer of 1991. In fact, he said he resigned his police responsibilities when the Serbs built a wall down the middle of the police station which had been under the command of a Muslim.<p>


Like previous witnesses, Pasic noted the disappearance of TV Sarajevo and its replacement by telecasts from Pale, Belgrade, and other locations in Serbia. He also noted the formation of the Serb Autonomous region.<p>

He said the shelling of Muslim area began in May 1992. After resistance by 50 Muslims with small weapons, the Serbs took over the town. During the bombardment, Pasic and others hid in the basement of his building. When Serb paramilitary troops in Black Berets rousted them, one young Muslim "lad" remained in the basement. The Serbs tossed a hand grenade in the basement to flush him out, Pasic said.<p>

For the first time, the court heard allegations of rape. Pasic told the tribunal that every night Serbs came to the secondary schools where Muslims initially were imprisoned. They would remove Muslim women, returning them the following morning weeping and distraught from being sexually assaulted and abused. <p>

Pasic's imprisonment lasted until July 21, 1993, and included time spent in Susica and Batcovic. He witnessed the now routine beatings and killings of detainees, including the shooting of one man called the professor" and two unoffending old men. Pasic noted that prisoners were beaten if they complained to International Red Cross personnel during camp visits. In fact, he said that women, children, the aged and those who obviously had been beaten were removed from the camps before such inspections.<p>

<b>Cross-Examination</b><br>
Defense lawyer Stephen Kay briefly cross-examined Pasic on the reliability of his claim that Muslim resistance consisted exclusively of 50 Muslims with pistols and hunting rifles.<p>

He maintained that Pasic had no way of knowing this because he was hiding in the basement. The questioning had a strange obligue character because Pasic evidently thought that Kay was questioning his courage in declining to join the resistance forces. Pasic protested that it was hopeless to resist artillery with rifles. Actually, the defense was raising its intermittent claim that witnesses are minimizing the military opposition faced by the Serbs.<p>

<b>Testimony on "Ethnic Cleansing"</b><br>
The prosecution's next witness was Hanne Sophie Greve, a Norwegian judge and international consultant to several international relief and human rights agencies. Her experience includes work in Thailand, Ethiopia, Angola, Romania and Cambodia. In October of 1993, she joined the U.N. Commission of Experts and was assigned to Prijedor. She talked to any government and relief personnel she could find, read as much literature as she could, and directed the more than 400 interviews of victims and witnesses from the Opstina.<p>

Thus far, she had quantified the number of "missing" persons from Prijedor as 43,000 Muslims and 3,000 Croats. She also has highlighted the strategic significance of Prijedor to the Serbs in the spring of 1992. It was a "corrider" which could link the Serb areas in Northeast Bosnia adjacent to Serbia with the Krajina Serbian sector in Northwestern Bosnia and Croatia.<p>

She also highlighted the propaganda used by Serb leaders to frighten and inflame Serbs in Northern Bosnia who Greve claimed had lived peacefully with their non-Serb neighbors since World War II. In the most telling metaphor of the trial testimony so far, she quoted from Serb publications which indicated that "corrider" was too weak a term to use for this connection of Serb-dominated lands to Greater Serbia. The correct term for Prijedor is the neck. The "neck" is more than the "corrider" between the head and the body.<p>

MAY 21<br>
The war crimes tribunal plans to start hearings next month on the charges against Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic.<p>

The so-called Rule 61 proceedings provide for a public, ex parte proceeding against any indicted person who has not been served or arrested. It is kind of a probable cause hearing. If the prosecutor prevails, then an "international arrest warrant" may be issued. The tribunal is empowered to notify the United Nations Security Council if any nation fails to fulfill its obligations to arrest and turn over such persons within its borders.<p>

Karadzic and Mladic have both been indicted on charges of genocide, including the killing of thousands of Muslim civilians at Srebrenica last year. The tribunal has indicted 57 people but only Dusko Tadic and three others are in custody.<p>

The tribunal's announcement comes several days after intense efforts by the Western powers to remove Karadzic from office. <p>

<b>Euphemistically Speaking</b><br>
The day's testimony again focused on "ethnic cleansing."  And at the end of today's parade of horrors, Judge McDonald asked witness Hanna Sophie Greve to define "ethnic cleansing" for the record. The witness almost apologized for using the term. "It is a euphemism." It means rounding up an ethnic group by violence or force and taking them to concentration camps like Omarska for torture, murder and deportation.<p>

Greve also described the "informative talks" that Serbs had with their captives at "military investigation centers." Simo Drljala, Serb Interior Minister, admitted that 6,000 of these "informative talks" took place at camps during the summer of 1992. Greve indicated that these "talks" exceeded 6,000 by a significant number and invariably involved torture. <p>

<b>Horrors of the Day</b><br>
There was no escaping the continuing torment in the camps. "Informative talks," beatings and killings were constant in Omarska and Keraterm. Particularly insidious was the practice of beating inmates who were trying to make it to the canteen for a meager portion of gruel or to the field to relieve themselves. <p>

Greve placed the massacre at Keraterm in July of 1992. Some 150 detainees were machine-gunned in the night, their bodies left until the following day. Then the bodies were disposed of at one time. Since the event took place adjacent to a road near the camp, the road was simply blocked off for the day to obstruct the views of bystanders.<p>

Some of those not kept in the camps were deported. Many were forced to sign over all their possessions as a condition of departing from Prijedor. They also signed pledges never to return to their homes. This, however, was just the start of a journey frequently made in cattle cars so tightly packed that children, the elderly and the inform perished along the route.<p>

The worst account of deportee travel offered by Greve today involved 250 males who had been deported and thought they were on their way to freedom. They were taken, however, to the top of Mt. Vlasic and forced to kneel on the edge of a cliff. They were then shot and pushed off the cliff. Only six men survived.<p>

<b>MAY 22</b><br>
Dusko Tadic was mentioned today by prosecutors for the first time since opening statements two weeks ago. The reference, in connection with the Serb bombardment of Kozarac, came during the redirect examination of witness Hanne Sophie Greve. It came on a day of intense defendant watching for me.<p>

<b>The Face of the Accused</b><br>
I had seen very little reaction on Tadic's face to the frequently dramatic testimony about "ethnic cleansing" offered thus far during the trial. I'm not sure any reliable conclusions can be drawn from a defendant's physical reactions, but they are worth observing. Maybe Tadic was stoic, perhaps he had become immobilized by fear, or just possibly I had been so caught up in watching the other activity in the courtroom that I missed his reactions.<p>

Since it is his trial, Tadic -- appropriately -- is the last to enter the courtroom in the morning. Only after the judges have settled behind their bench and the usher has told us in impeccable French and English to be seated does he take his place in the dock. Flanked by U.N. guards, Tadic takes his seat.<p>

He seldom smiles. And when he does, it is in the direction of one of the two elderly women who seem to constitute his only non-legal human contact. They are his Hague family, and if one of them is present he makes eye contact and his face lights up briefly, then returns to stone. If he does not see either of them after making one visual pass through the gallery, he opens his notebook, glances at the computer and looks across the courtroom. <p>

This week, I have noticed that he has been alternating black and blue suits, while wearing a subtly patterned blue and yellow tie.<p>

He seems alert, but he has not put on his earphones for more than a few minutes during the testimony of Greve. He does, however, carefully watch his monitor with its simultaneous transcript, exhibits, or any video being offered. Tadic is such a prolific note taker that it is hard to believe he is not comprehending and reacting to the proceedings.<p>

This morning, as Greve resumed her testimony, she began enumerating the military units active in Prijedor during the "ethnic cleansing" campaign. Tadic seemed to take detailed notes as she talked about the 343rd Motorized Brigade, the Fifth Kozarac Brigade, the 11th Partisan Brigade. He did not stop taking copious notes until she stopped talking about the military units.<p>

Later, he resumed note taking and closely examined exhibit 123 as Greve contrasted the 6,056 person increase in the Serbian population in Prijedor in 1992 with the 43,227 person decline among the Muslims.<p>

Surprisingly, Tadic did not move a muscle as one of his lawyers questioned Greve over the reliability of the census data on which she had relied. On the other hand, he did confer with his lawyers at each break today.<p>

The defense strategy with Greve, as it as been with other witnesses, is to suggest that events were more complicated than portrayed by the prosecution. In particular, they want the court to conclude that Muslims were well armed, organized and vigorous in resistance. Today, Greve would have none of it. In fact, this defense tack paved the way for the most interesting testimony of the day, when they challenged her version of the bombardment of Kozarac. Greve maintained that Muslim life and property took a pounding in the town from Serb artillery on May 24, 1992. Defense counsel Steven Kay suggested that Serbs also were victims of the attack. Greve responded that Serbs left the town before the attack.<p>

On redirect examination, prosecutor Alan Tieger asked Greve if the few buildings left standing after the attack were the Serb Orthodox Church and the home and cafe of Tadic. Greve said yes. (It is alleged in Count 1 of the indictment that Tadic lit signal flares to assist in the bombardment.)<p>

<b>MAY 23</b><br>
"Their eyes! That look! Their eyes were not on the outside, but somewhere deep, deep inside!"<p>

That is how journalist Muharem Nezirevic remembers the faces of Omarska.<p>

In the most emotional testimony of the trial so far, he testified about his recollections of the Serb propaganda offensive and about how his own position at Radio Prijedor became tentative and dangerous once the Serbs took over. He was powerless to prevent them from broadcasting attacks on prominent non-Serbs. He recalled that they accused one Croat physician of being "Doctor Monster," and they charged that he castrated Serb women and newborn children to prevent the procreation of the Serb people.<p>

The Serbs denied Muslims access to the radio station, even preventing a group from Kozarac from offering assurances that they would personally guard the Serbian Orthodox Church in their town. <p>

When finally arrested for deportation to Omarska, Nezirevic and other detainees were forced to run a gauntlet of Serb police, who beat them. They were beaten again when they arrived at the camp, and then sent to the infamous White House, where Nezirevic observed prisoners in crowded conditions, stacked on top of one another with "their eyes inside their heads."<p>

The inmates were primary Muslims, but he also saw abuse heaped upon a Serb, incarcerated as a Muslim sympathizer. <p>

The prisoners were beaten every night. On one of Nezirevic's first nights in Omarska,  a man was taken out and returned with signs of having been beaten badly about the face and head -- but he was smiling -- happy that he had survived.<p>

Those who did survive had little reason to thank their Serb captors. There was no medical care except for that provided by an inmate doctor. Lacking any tools or facilities, he used a needle and thread to suture wounds. He tended to a man who had been beaten till his brains were exposed by using the man's own hair to sew up his head.<p>

<b>And The Children</b><br>
On his first night in the White House, he saw an elderly man throw his body across his young son to shield him from the being beaten. Another man gave half of his food ration (1/8 loaf of bread each 24 hours) to his son through an intermediary who was quartered near the son. One day, the intermediary approached Nezirevic and said he did not know how to tell the man that his son had been taken away and killed. His dilemma was short lived;  the father was soon dead.<p>

Testimony at a trial like this had to be affected by the fact that the human mind apparently reacts to horror like Omarska by dimming memory. Like others before him, Nezirevic hinted at this when he said, "I do not like to remember these things or to speak about them, but I must."  <p>

The defense declined to cross-examine the witness. And the judges did not ask any questions.<p>

MAY 24<br>
The court was in recess.<P>

Developments in the war crimes trial of Dusko Tadic from May 27-31.<p>

MAY 29<br>
Mirsad Mujadzic continued to describe how the government in Bosnia-Herzegovina was slowly destroyed by the Serbs. <p>

He began before the 1990 elections when it became clear that Serb nationalism was rapidly increasing. At first, Serb officials apologized for the misconduct of some who were tearing dwon opposition placards abnd spewing natiionalist rhetoric. <p>

But after the SDS (Serb party) lost most of the electionss in Prejidor, the Serb party leaders seemed ready to discard democracy and ready to arrogate power by force. In all of the elections, the SDA (the Muslim party of which Mujadzic was a high-ranking official) gave the SDA more than they deserved based on the election results. The Serbs wanted control of at least 50 percent of the republic's government. Eventually, Mujadzic said he was even willing to give in to that unfair and anti-democratic request. He was told by Radovan Karadzic and others that there would be grave consequences if the Muslims tried to stand in the way of the Serbs.<p>

His testimony concluded with more about Karadzic's threats leading up to the Serb takeover.<p>

MAY 30<br>
Misrad Mujadzic continued to descrobe how the Serbs took over cities in Bosnia-Herzegovinia by force.<p>

There were some intersting points in his direct testimony.<p>

@ Having no idea that the Serbs were poised to take control of Prejidor, he dined with a Serb colonel and other Serbs the night before they took the city.<p>

@ Unlike other witnesses, Mujadzic escaped Serb beatings. He and some relatives and friends fled to the forest after realizing that they would be targeted by the Serbs. They dug a hole and stayed for a month. After hearing that the Serbs were planning to clear out the forest, and after coming under fire, he swam to safety in Bihac.<p>

@ When recalling the Serb takeover of Prijedor, he said it reminded him "of films about the military in Latin America,"  He said he was thinking the the same way people in other European countries think now and have thought in the past:  "it couldn't happen here."<p>

In the most contentious cross-examination yet, defense attorney Stephen Kay tried to show that the Muslims were well-financed fighters. More than half of his cross-examination focused on how much Germans had helped fund the SDA. <p>

Kay also attacked Mujadzic's account of an incident where two Serbs were killed at an SDA checkpoint. The witness had said that it began when Serb extremists fired on members of the Territorial Defense. "How on earth," Kay asked, could the witness know who shot first since he did not actually see the shooting? Kay went as far as to say, "you were quite happy for these killings to take place...weren't you?" Mujadzic denied any bias in his depiction of the story.<p>

MAY 31<br>
History was made when the Dusko Tadic trial began. It was a first -- the process began and so history was made. Well, a more definitive historic milestone was passed today -- it was something concrete, an outcome and the closest the tribunal has come towards achieving accountability.<p>

Drazen Erdemovic, a 24-year-old ethnic Croat who fought for the Bosnian Serb army, pleaded guilty to crimes against humanity for shooting civilian Muslim men outside Srebrenica in July of 1995. After his guilty plea, the alternative charge of violations of the rules and customs of war was dropped.<p>

Srebrenica had been declared a U.N. "safe area" in 1993. Nevertheless, on July 6, 1995, the Bosnian Serb army mounted an attack on Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia and thousands of Muslim men were eventually killed. On July 16, Erdemovic and others shot and killed hundreds of men in groups of ten at a field in Pilica.<p>

Erdemovic broke down in tears as he told the court that he forced under the threat of death to shoot the civilians. It was shoot or be shot. <p>

"Your honor, I had to do this," he told the presiding judge, Claude Jorda of France. "If I had refused, I would have been killed together with the victims." <p>

Erdemovic will be sentenced in July. He could be sentenced to life in prison for his role in the massacre.<p>

Meanwhile, a witness testified behind closed doors in the Tadic trial.<P>

Developments in the war crimes trial of Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic from June 4-7, 1996.<p>


JUNE 4<br>
The secretive witness P stepped down after more than two days of questioning. It is believed that the witness, who testified behind closed doors, is a Serb turncoat. It is known that the witness is scared, that he testified against the Serb military but did not directly implicate Dusko Tadic.<p>


The next witness was Osman Selak, a former colonel in the Yugoslav National Army. Selak, a Muslim, began providing an inside look at the army under questioning by Col. Brenda Hollis. Hollis seems to be the prosecution's inquisitor on military issues.<p>


Selak was asked primarily about two issues.<p>


First, Selak testified about uniforms. His responsibilities included supplying them to troops. He described the various JNA uniforms and their insignias. In times of war after 1991, they were to wear new camouflage uniforms. He also described how in 1991, Republic of Serbska flags started sprouting up and the Republic's initials began to appear on uniforms. The prosecution will use this testimony to show that the Serbs and the JNA were backing and leading the Bosnian Serbs to prove it was an  international conflict.<p>


Selak also began to describe how the JNA slowly disintegrated from an ethnically-diverse force into a Serb-dominated organization intent on forcing out even the most senior Muslim officers.<p>


JUNE 5<br>
Former Yugoslav National Army Colonel Osman Selak offered a high-level account of who was calling the shots and who was firing them.<p>


Selak's direct testimony included the following points:<p>


@ In 1991, Serb leaders were making public disparaging comments about Croats and Muslims and some were saying that the groups were preparing to wipe out the Muslims.<p>


@ In 1991, the Serbs began insisting that the Territorial Defense return all its weapons to the JNA. (The Territorial Defense, also known as the TO, served as a sort of militia made up of retired JNA soldiers or part-timers who used the JNA's discarded weapons. Furthermore, the only units of the TO to continue receiving support in 1991 were the Serb units who were fighting Croats or Muslims.<p>


@ Light Brigades started appearing during the fighting with Croatia, possibly as a precursor to the paramilitary groups.<p>


@ As the JNA forces began pulling out of Croatia and Slovenia all of the weapons and solders were to be pulled out. In fact, Selak said one Bosnian-Croat was tried and convicted for high treason for leaving his unit in Croatia. This is important because when the JNA allegedly pulled out of Bosnia, the prosecution says they left all of their weapons and many high-ranking Serbian solders. This helps show Serbia was backing and controlling the Bosnian Serb army.<p>


@ In 1991, all of the Bosnian Serb JNA member in Serbian were told the return to Bosnia and Selak noticed a huge increase in the number of soldiers in Bosnia.<p>


@ Selak identified Serbs who were leading paramilitary groups. When asked whether the Serb leaders were on active duty, he said all those on active duty were paid by Belgrade.<p>


@ After May 18, 1992, the Republic of Serbka army called itself the VRS and the VJ became the Yugoslav army. Selak said that essentially nothing changed and Belgrade still controlled and paid for both.<p>


@ Selak became the only high-ranking non-Serb in the army until he resigned sometime at the end of May or June of 1992. After he resigned, he became a leader of the non-violent Muslim resistance group.<p>


@ The attack on Kozarac was justified by the Serbs who said the Muslims had sided with the Croats.<p>

@ He finished with the story about how his wife died in a German hospital in 1995 after he was unable to leave the country for two weeks.<p>

During cross-examination, the defense asked Selak to review Dusko Tadic's military records including dated stamps which indicated various time of service and units. The defense seemed to think this might help prove that Tadic could not or would not have been around Omarska at the time of the killings.<p>

JUNE 6<br>
A former colonel in the Yugoslav National Army (JNA) offered testimony about the military's chain of command.<p>

Ludvik Kranjc, a Slovenian and former brigade commander in the army,  testified that the paramilitary organizations always were under the direct supervision of the JNA as was the police force in times of war. This testimony may provide the necessary link between Dusko Tadic's activities in the local police force and the JNA.<p>

He also was asked an interesting hypothetical question which clearly related to Tadic: could a man of military age living near Banja Luka who fled from his commune because he did not want to fight against non-Serbs in his area return three to four weeks after the combat operations to become the head of the local commune and a member of the Serb police force? <p>

"I think it is possible," he responded. <p>

So Kranjc became the first witness to specifically put Tadic's alibi in doubt albeit in the form of a hypothetical.<p>

Prosecutor Scott Keegan then sought to undermine the defense's cross-examination of the previous witness, Osman Selak, a former colonel in the Yugoslav National Army, about the recording of military activities. Keegan asked Kranjc whether all military activities were recorded. During May and June 1992 many logistical matters were overlooked, according to the witness. <p>

The tribunal also heard from author and journalist Ed Vulliamy. He wrote the book "Seasons in Hell" about his experiences in Bosnia and now works for The Guardian of London. He interviewed some of the soldiers and witnessed some of the atrocities. He began discussing a convoy where he saw that some people recently had been slaughtered. He testified for less than an hour and will return to the witness stand tomorrow.<p>

JUNE 7<br>
British journalist Edward Vulliamy provided the tribunal with its first look inside the Omarska prison camp.<p>

The judges had heard about the camp, but Vulliamy brought the pictures. He showed them a videotape of his visit to Omarska in 1993, when he was one of the first journalists allowed inside the camp. His reports helped close down the camp. He also showed video from another camp, Trnopolje, and the men there looked even worse than those at Omarska.<p>

The video he showed was startling. Some of the men in it were emaciated, other looked like walking corpses.<p>

Vulliamy, who writes for the Guardian of London and authored "Seasons in Hell" about his experiences in Bosnia, said he and the others with him were allowed only limited access to Omarska, so they only were allowed to see the men eat. The men were forced to run through the camp, then were given one minute to gulp down a meal of watery beans and a piece of bread. Vulliamy said he suspected the meal was staged for the benefit of the visiting journalists because he thought at the time that if the men ate even half that well every day, they wouldn't be as thin as they were.<p>

He also detailed a series of hoops he had to climb through in order to convince the Bosnian Serbs to take him to Omarska in the first place. He said that on the way, his convoy suffered a "surprise attack," supposedly by the Muslims, but he said he believed the Serbs staged it to try and convince the journalists to turn around.<p>

Before discussing Omarksa, the witness testified about a series of encounters he had in the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. He detailed the stories of many people who were forced from their homes by the violence, and showed the tribunal videotapes of some of his interviews.<p>

Vulliamy said people who lived in the town of Bijac were forced to move underground and live in the bunkers and tunnels built by the Germans during World War II. One woman living underground told him she survived the war, but that what she faced then was nothing compared to what she faced in the 1990s.<p>

He said he found another village that had been "cleansed" of all Muslims. The refugees were living across the border, where every day they looked at their former homes but were not allowed to see what was happening at the home. He said a Bosnian Serb had taken over the house and was living there, saying he felt fine about doing that because his home in Sarajevo was blown up by a Muslim.<p>

<b>The Shelling of Sarajevo</b><br>
Vulliamy told the tribunal that he was in Sarajevo when it came under fire in 1993. He said Serbian soldiers showed him their gun positions, and one told him, "the only good Muslim is a dead Muslim."<p>

He said Sarajevo is a city surrounded by mountains, so it was easy prey for snipers. Once, he said, people at a water well (the gas and water had been shut off) were shelled. When he got there about 20 minutes later, he saw "bodies, bits of bodies," all around.<p>

He said the constant shelling of Sarajevo was a way of driving its residents mad because they knew they were vulnerable whenever they went outdoors.<p>

<b>The Camps</b><br>
The witness then described the destruction he saw on his way to the Prijedor area to visit the Omarska camp. Many communities were destroyed. Others were partially destroyed, with some homes remaining intact. Vulliamy said he was told the intact houses belonged to Serbs or Muslims and Croats who had accepted the "new order."<p>

After his story on Omarska, the camp was closed down almost immediately. Serbian officials insisted that reports about Omarska being a prison camp were wrong and that pictures of the camp were montages.<p>

In addition to the Omarska tape, he showed the tribunal video from Trnopolje. The video showed rail-thin prisoners, standing behind barbed wire. He said one man told him Trnopolje wasn't as bad as Omarska.<p>

Developments in the war crimes trial of Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic from June 10-14, 1996.<p>

JUNE 10<br>
The tribunal was not in session.<p>

JUNE 11<br>
A witness testified behind closed doors. It is believed that the testimony from the person known only as "Witness Q" directly implicated Dusko Tadic.<P>

JUNE 12<br>
The tribunal spent most of the day in closed session hearing from Witness "Q," the first of the so-called eyewitnesses who can allegedly directly implicate Dusko Tadic.<p>

Officials won't identify the witness, but it is known that the individual was called to testify about Count I of the indictment -- persecution on non-Serbs in the Prijedor region. <p>

The court then heard from Azra Blazevic, a veterinarian who lived in Tadic's hometown of Kozarac. She said she and Tadic were acquaintances and she saw him frequently saw him, sometimes on a daily basis. Blazevic said they lived a couple of hundred meters from one another.<p>

During her two hours of testimony, she did not say anything about Tadic. Instead, she told a little about herself and about how Kozarac, a predominantly Muslim town, was taken over by the Serbs in May 1992.<p>

She also said:<p>

@ On April 30, 1992, the Serbs took over Prijedor and announced they had been forced to take the action because of the danger of Muslim extremists. She said she went to Prijedor that day and found the city unusually empty. Prijedor was generally a busy city, but on that day, she saw military people in uniforms but virtually no civilians.<p>

@ Within days, the Serbs in Prijedor were issuing ultimatums to the Muslims who lived in Kozarac. They were demanding that the city and police officials sign Serbian loyalty oaths, and telling people in the town to turn over all their weapons. (She claimed the only weapons the villagers had were some hunting rifles and a few pistols.)<p>

@ On May 23, 1992, she could hear gunfire from the direction of Prijedor. "Later on, one could see the smoke and flames rising from the area of the hills," she said. <p>

@ On May 24, 1992, Kozarac was attacked. She and others thought the attack was imminent because all but two Serbs had left the town in the previous days. By the time of the attack, the city was surrounded and there were no escape routes, she said. <p>

Just before the attack, she went  to the medical center to see if she could help. The only non-Muslim there was a woman named Gordina. Not long after she arrived, the firing began. She said all the firing appeared to be directed toward the city. <p>

"It started suddenly with terrible shelling that seemed as if thousands of shells were falling at the same time," she said. "Shortly after that, the wounded began arriving."<p>

@ On May 25, 1992, she and the others moved to a hotel because it had become too dangerous in the center, The Serbs were everywhere, and there was no way for people to get their wounded safely to the hotel, she said. <p>

Once in the hotel, she overheard negotiations between the Kozarac police and the Serbian military. She heard the military demanding that the police surrender and turn over their weapons. After that, she said, the military leaders were saying the civilians would be able to leave in a single file.<p>

The next day, the police surrendered and the civilians fled Kozarac.<p>

Blazevic did not mention Tadic in her testimony, but she certainly laid the groundwork for some potentially incriminating testimony. For instance, the indictment alleges Tadic and Goran Borovnica fatally shot four Muslims as the Kozarac civilians were attempting to leasve the city.<p>

It also alleges Tadic participated in the attack on Korazac by lighting flares to faciliate tank and artillery fire, organizing the detention of the population for deportation to capms, killing an edlerly woman near the cemetery, besting a former policement from Korazac and beating two Muslim males from Kozarac in the Prijedor military barracks.<p>

JUNE 13<br>
Two witnesses publicly linked Dusko Tadic to the violence in Bosnia in 1992.<p>

One witness said she saw Tadic wearing a uniform and carrying a rifle in the middle of things as Tadic's hometown of Kozarac was being taken over by the Serbs. The second witness claimed to have seen Tadic wearing a camouflage uniform and carrying an automatic rifle as Kozarac residents were rounded up and taken to prison camps.<p>

Azra Blazevic, a veterinarian who lived in Kozarac, previously testified that she knew Tadic and used to see him almost every day. Today, she described her final minutes in Kozarac before she and others were taken to the Trnopolje prison camp.<p>

She said the Serbs took her and other medical personnel to an intersection in town. While she was there, she heard someone whisper, "There's Dule," and she looked up and saw Tadic walking across the street. (Dule is a nickname for Dusko.)<p>

She said he was carrying a weapon in one hand and his other hand was raised as if he was trying to get someone's attention. Blazevic said was wearing a uniform but she could not describe it. <p>

On cross-examination, the defense suggested her identification was wrong. Defense attorney Michail Wladimiroff noted that she had seen the man identified as "Dule" for only a few seconds, and she was unable to describe the face of the man she saw. He also suggested that she identified Tadic in court because he was sitting in the logical place for a defendant to be sitting in a courtroom. She denied that, saying, "I know him. It doesn't matter to me where he sits."<p>

The defense also suggest that Tadic may have been living abroad from during the time period (1986 to 1992) that Blazevic said she saw him many times. The witness said it was possible that he may have been out of the country and she wouldn't have realized it.<p>

She told the tribunal that she made two trips back to Kozarac after she was taken to the Trnopolje prison camp. The first trip,  in late May 1992, shortly after she arrived at the camp, was to try and retrieve medicine that might have been left in the village.<p>

Her second trip in June was to get some personal documents. She said Kozarac was almost completely destroyed at the time, but she noticed several houses -- including one belonging to Tadic -- that were largely undamaged. She said Tadic's house had a sign on it that said: Serb House. Do Not Touch.<p>

The second eyewitness to publicly identify Tadic was Nasiha Klipic, a Muslim from a town three kilometers from Kozarac who said she known the defendant all her life.<p>

She told the tribunal about one incident in 1985-86 when she and other went to a bar after a wedding. Tadic and his friends were there, and he pulled her chair out as she began to sit down so she fell to the ground. She described it as a funny moment, and many in the courtroom gallery laughed out loud as she recalled a side of Tadic that few have seen.<p>

Klipic said she frequently saw Tadic because she went to taverns and bars a lot. She said she knew he  was a karate instructor. she also knew his father, his wife and his children.<p>

Her husband was a Prijedor police officer until April 29, 1992, when the Serbians took over Prijedor. He then moved to Kozarac and worked there until late May. He disappeared during the violence and she does not know what happened to him.<p>

When the alarm sounded in late May indicating Kozarac was in imminent danger of attack, her husband went to the police station and she and her children hid in a basement with others. The group in the basement eventually tried to get away by hiding in the mountains but the army arrived and she and the others surrendered. The army took them to Kozarac, and on the way, she said she saw all the signs of war.<p>

She said that as the group was walking from Kozarac toward Kozarusa, a police car carrying several men -- including Tadic -- drove up. She said she was a half a meter away and is positive Tadic was in the car. She said he was wearing a camouflage uniform.<p>

On the road between Kozarac and Kozarusa, the Serbs were singling out certain Muslims and taking them away to kill them, she said. When they arrived in Kozarusa, the men were pulled out of the group and were put into one of three groups: those headed for Omarska, for Keraterm or for Trnopolje.<p>

At this point, she said, she saw Tadic again and heard him loudly say, "Where do I take these?" (It's unclear whether he was talking about the group of men or the remaining women and children. But if the judges believe her testimony, it clearly puts Tadic right in the middle of things as the war was progressing.) Tadic was carrying an automatic rifle and pistol at the time, she said.<p>

Klipic said she and her children ended up in Trnopolje.<p>

JUNE 14<br>
The tribunal heard some of the most dramatic testimony to date when a survivor of the Omarksa camp said he saw Dusko Tadic kill two Muslim police officers in May 1992.<p>

Nihad Seferovic testified that he was hiding in an orchard when he saw Tadic slit the throats of two Kozarac policemen.<p>

Three eyewitnesses now have publicly linked Tadic to the violence, and they have identified Tadic in court. The defense has attacked the witnesses, accusing them of making up their Tadic sightings.<p>

Before Seferovic testified, the court heard from Nasiha Klipic, who previously testified that she twice saw Tadic wearing a uniform and carrying weapons as the Serbs were taking over the village of Kozarac.<p>

Today,  she told a personal story of devastation as she recounted how 35 men in her family disappeared or were killed in the war. She identified pictures of some of them, including her husband, brothers and father-in-law. She cried as she described how her husband and one of her brothers disappeared. (In the indictment, Tadic is accused of helping to kill her brother, Enver Alic, at Omarska. So far, the tribunal has heard that he is missing. They have not heard confirmation that he is dead.)<p>

She also testified that she saw Tadic twice near the Trnopolje prison camp. Once, she saw him in the passenger of a police car as she was walking near Prijedor to get some medicine for her children in early June 1992. Tadic was wearing camouflage.<p>

The second time, she said, was a sighting across the street from the camp. Tadic again was wearing camouflage and was carrying a rifle and pistol.<p>

She saw Tadic again in mid- to late-June in Prijedor. He was wearing civilian clothes and was standing in front of the police station.<p>

She identified Tadic in court, and scolded him for the way he looked. "He never was so smartly dressed like this," she said. "Shame on you."<p>

Under cross-examination by defense attorney Stephen Kay, she could not explain why she claims she saw Tadic in Kozarac headed toward Prijedor, then she saw him an hour and a half later in a different location headed the other direction. The defense contends she made up the sightings, yet she didn't see Tadic pass her, which he would have had to do to have been in both places at the times she alleged.<p>

"As to how he got there, I don't know. Ask him," Klipic said.<p>

She also could not explain some apparent discrepancies in a statement she gave to a tribunal investigator in October 1995. In it, she did not mention seeing Tadic twice on May 27, 1992, as she did during her testimony. She said she had forgotten it.<p>

She also could not explain why in the statement she said Tadic was "deciding" where Muslims would be sent after the Serbs overtook Kozarac. During her court testimony, she said Tadic was present when male Muslims were taken away from their families and divided into groups headed toward different prison camps. She said she heard Tadic say, "Where do I take these?" The defense pointed out that the statement is quite a bit benign than her statement to the tribunal investigator that he was deciding who would be sent to Omarska.<p>

Klipic bristled at Kay's suggestions that she made up seeing Tadic. "I said the truth. I would be happier if I was lying to you and if my family was alive," she said. <p>

The defense suggested that Tadic might have been in Prijedor because he could have been with a Serbian man who was seeking to get him Muslim wife out of the prison camp.<p>

<b>Tadic Accused of Murder</b><br>
Seferovic, a Muslim survivor of Omarksa and the first witness to say he saw Tadic commit murder, said he grew up in Kozarac and played with the Tadic children when he was young. He also said he helped Tadic build his cafe. (He said it was a tradition for everyone to chip in when someone had a major construction project.)

He said that in May 1992, it was obvious the Serbs were taking over the Kozarac area. The roads were blocked and Muslims were not free to travel, and the Serbs too over the television stations and began broadcasting Serbian TV.<p>

When the attack on Kozarac began, he went to the hills seeking safety. He came back in the next couple of days to feed his birds, and while he was in Kozarac he saw Tadic kill the police officers.<p>

He said he was hiding in an orchard across the street from the Serbian Orthodox Church near his brother's house. He said he saw six or so Muslim police officers being held by about 15 Serb military men. He recognized four of the Muslims.<p>

He then saw Tadic drag men named Osman and Ekremn Krabasic away and cut their throats. "I did not see the knife, just the gush of blood," he said, adding that he then "retreated in despair." (The indictment accuses Tadic or working with Goran Borovnica to shoot four men in Kozarac -- Ekrem Karabasic, Ismet Karabasic, Seido Karabasic and Redo Foric. It is not known how the difference in names or manner of death might affect the case.)<p>

Defense attorney Kay suggested that the witness could not have had a clear view of the church because he was hiding in brush. The brush would have seemingly obstructed his view. Seferovic denied that, and said his view of the church was "all too clear."<p>

Kay then maintained that Seferovic invented the incident, but the witness said, "I saw it with my own eyes."<p>

Kay pointed out a minor discrepancy in Seferovic's testimony, He noted that the witness testified that his brother's house was 50-60 meters from the church. In his May 4, 1995, statement to a tribunal investigator, he said the house was 100 meters away.<p>

Kay also asked a series of questions about the manner of death, locking Seferovic into his story that their throats were slit.<p>

Developments in the war crimes trial of Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic from June 17-21, 1996.<p>

JUNE 17<br>
The tribunal was not in session.<p>

JUNE 18<br>
Two Muslims accused of war crimes pleaded not guilty and their attorneys said the defendants were acting only in self-defense to protect themselves from the aggression of Bosnian Serbs.<p>

Hazim Delic and Esad Landzo were named in the Celebici indictment, named for the Muslim-run Celebici prison camp in the Konjic municipality. Two other men named in the indictment, Zdravko Mucic and Zejnil Delalic, entered not guilty pleas earlier this spring. <p>

"It is common knowledge in the tribunal and the world that the aggressor was Serbia," an attorney for Landzo told the court. "It was not an attack, it was self defense. It was the only way to save the city from the same fate as Prijedor and Kozarac."<p>

The indictment against the Muslims is important because it is the first dealing with alleged crimes against Bosnian Serbs. The prosecution wants to try all four men together but attorneys for Delalic and Mucic already have filed motion for separate trials.<p>

Three of the four men -- Delalic, Mucic and Delic -- are accused of holding command positions at the camp. Landzo is accused of being a camp guard.<p>

In a related development, a Serb incarcerated since March was released after prosecutors became convinced that they had the wrong man in custody. Goran Lajic was returned to Germany, where he was arrested in March.<p>

In the trial of Dusko Tadic, a second survivor of the Omarska prison camp testified about the brutal conditions he was forced to endure. Ferid Mujcic said he saw Tadic several times at the camp but never saw him commit  a crime. He said Tadic, whom he has known since childhood, was wearing a camouflage uniform and carrying a gun each time he saw him.<p>


JUNE 19<br>
A Muslim laborer described how his adult son was yanked from his arms as they marched though Kozarac in May of 1992. Salko Karabasic said Dusko Tadic singled out his son and had one of his colleagues pull him away. Karabasic said he fought to save his son from being pulled to a near-certain death, but the guards forced him to let go by threatening to take him too. The son has not been seen since that day.<p>

Karabasic identified Tadic in court and said he is "1,000 percent sure" he is the same person he saw singling people out of a column of Muslims during the siege on Kozarac. He said Tadic was issuing orders and Goran Borovnica was carrying them out.<p>

JUNE 20<br>
Two more survivors of Omarska testified today but neither one offered particularly incriminating evidence against Dusko Tadic.<p>

One witness said he saw Tadic twice at the camp but did not see him doing anything other than standing with other Serbs wearing camouflage uniforms. The other witness said Tadic beat him up but not when he was at Omarska. He said he took karate lessons from Tadic when he was a kid (he's 35 now) and that Tadic got mad and once beat him up after he accidentally kicked another kid in the head. The witness has not yet testified about Tadic in relationship to anything that happened to him during the war.<p>

One strange thing happened in court while the witness, Nihad Haskic, was testifying. When he was asked if he saw Tadic in court, Tadic stood up and said, "I'm Dule Tadic." (Dule is a nickname for Dusko.) <p>

It was one of the first times Tadic has spoken in court, and appeared as if he thought it was ridiculous for the prosecutor to ask the witness if Tadic was in the room when everyone in the court knew who he was and where he was sitting.<p>

JUNE 21<br>
A Muslim survivor of Trnopolje offered the most graphic testimony yet about life inside the prison camp.<p>

Sulejman Besic told the tribunal that there was constant shooting at the camp. "They were shooting for fun," he said. "It was like music to them. They couldn't do without it."<p>

In testifying about conditions at the camp, Besic said he wasn't given food during his first four days at Trnopolje. On the fourth day, the guards brought food for the children because a Serbian television crew was present. The guards passed out chocolate to the children but as soon as the television crew was gone, the guards picked up the food and no one was allowed to eat it.<p>

There were no toilet facilities for the prisoners. Some inmates were forced to dig ditches to use as toilets, but the unsanitary conditions made disease spread quickly.<p>

One day, Besic said he was sent to the interrogation room. Guards wanted to know what he had done with his weapon. He insisted he did not have a weapon and he was beaten. As he was being beaten, a man walked in and told the guards to stop. The man turned out to be Besic's former boss, a Serb. The former boss said, "I know him and he had no rifle." That ended the particular beating, but there were many others.<p>

Once, the guards told the inmates they could go if they got on a bus. There was a mad rush for the bus, but Besic didn't try to get on., He later heard that everyone on the bus had been shot. The Trnopolje camp commander, however, told the remaining inmates that the people were freed and that about 20 of them were killed by Muslims.<p>

Another time, he said he and four others were given shovels and told to start digging. Besic said he began to think something was suspicious because the guards were sitting nearby drinking cognac and arguing over what was going to go in the hole. Besic faked a stomach cramp and asked to if he could go to the toilet. He said he never saw any of the four men again, leaving the implication that they had dug their own graves.<p>

He also offered detailed testimony these atrocities:<p>

@ A Serb soldier killed a mother in front of her adult son, who was incarcerated in a prison camp. The guard then forced the son to disrobe and ordered him to rape his mother. The son was killed, apparently before he was forced to touch his mother's body.<p>

@ A professor held prisoner apparently was shot by one of his former students, who was irritated about his bad grades. The student-turned-guard said, "If my marks had been better, your life would have lasted longer."<p>

@ A group of elderly Muslim men were stabbed in the throat and killed when they tried to protect several Muslim teenage girls from being attacked by guards.<p>

Besic said he met Tadic twice before the war. He has not yet mentioned Tadic in connection with anything he saw during the war.<p>

Besic took the witness stand after Saud Hrnic, a Muslim survivor of Omarska, completed his testimony.<p>

He testified that he once saw Dusko Tadic at the camp. Hrnic said he was lying on the ground in an outdoor area of the camp when he looked up and saw Tadic. He said he did not know what Tadic was doing, whether he was carrying any weapons, whether he had a beard or whether he was alone or in a group.<p>

The witness said that when he saw Tadic, his former karate instructor, he put his head down so Tadic would not see him. He said the guards seemed to kill anyone they knew in Omarska and he didn't want Tadic to recognize him.<p>

During cross-examination, the defense pointed out that it's difficult to believe Hrnic would be face down on the ground and still see Tadic. Defense attorney Stephen Kay wondered why Hrnic would risk his life by lifting his head to see who was around. <p>

Kay also suggested that Hrnic might have gotten Tadic confused with Dusko Banovic, who also was at Omarska. The witness said it was impossible because he knew Banovic only by the nickname of Duca. And at one point, Hrnic seemed to bristle at Kay's suggestion that he did not really see Tadic at the camp.<p>

"I don't know, were you there or was I there," he said.<p>

Developments in the war crimes trial of Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic from June 24-28, 1996.<p>

JUNE 24<br>
The tribunal was not in session.<p>

JUNE 25<BR>
Three more witnesses testified to seeing Dusko Tadic inside the Omarska prison camp, but none saw him doing anything more than walking with a group of men in camouflage.<p>

There wasn't much major testimony but prosecutors did elicit some interesting information, including testimony that:<p>


In 1990-91, a Belgrade newspaper printed a story about Dusko Tadic receiving hate mail threatening to liquidate the Tadic family if it didn't move out of town. A witness said he later heard a rumor that Tadic's wife wrote the letter. (The prosecution wasn't clear about the significance of this, but apparently it hopes to suggest that Tadic was stirring things up well before the war.<p>

Also, Tadic was on a peace committee established by the town of Kozarac when residents began to fear the town would be overtaken by the Serbs. Tadic was well-known in town, and Muslims wanted him on the committee because they thought he could be trusted to represent everyone's interests.<p>

JUNE 26<br>
The prosecution ended this phase of the trial by calling the eighth witness who claims to have seen Dusko Tadic inside the Omarska prison camp.<p>

The witness, Kemal Susic, was even more adamant about seeing Tadic than those witnesses who preceded him on the witness stand. Susic, a physical education teacher, said he has known the Tadic family for years. He said he knows Tadic's physique so well that he would have known him even in the dark, and he said he is positive he saw the defendant at the camp.<p>

Susic said he saw Tadic walking into the administration building with a group of soldiers. He said he was disappointed because he had hoped Tadic would have stayed out of the war and distanced himself from the Serbian soldiers.<p>

For a while today, it looked as if the defense would wage a war over a series of photo line-ups conducted by the prosecution, but defense attorney Michail Wladimiroff backed off after the court said it would not allow his expert to testify in person today. Wladimiroff said he would address the issue when the defense presents its case.<p>

JUNE 27<br>
The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia started a so-called <A href=rule61.html>Rule 61 hearing</A> against Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic. <p>

Developments in the war crimes trial of Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic from July 15-19, 1996.<p>

JULY 15<br>
The court was not in session.<p>

JULY 16<br>
The trial resumed with the tribunal spending most of the day on a defense motion relating to hearsay evidence.<p>

The defense asked the court to exclude all hearsay evidence unless the prosecution can demonstrate why it should be admitted. The current rule at the tribunal favors the admissibility of hearsay evidence, that is, all hearsay evidence comes in unless the defense can demonstrate why it should not. That, the defense argued, is unfair. The defense contended it  can't cross-examine the person who allegedly made the statement or test its truthfulness.<p>

The prosecution contended the defense was trying to significantly change the burden and terms of admissibility.<p>

The relevant rules discussed were Rules 89 (c) and (d). Rule 89 (c) provides: "A Chamber may admit any relevant evidence which it deems to have probative value." Rule 89 (d) provides: "A Chamber may exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the need to ensure a fair trial."<p>

The defense wants to exclude hearsay evidence that goes directly to Dusko Tadic's guilt. And, the defense wants the court to make rulings on hearsay statements without hearing their content. That makes sense in terms of Rule 89 (c) -- the court needs to hear the circumstances under which a statement is made in order to determine its reliability; arguably it does not need to hear the actual content of the statement. The defense, however, also argued that the court should not hear the content of a hearsay statement before applying Rule 89 (d) -- but, it appears that the essence of Rule 89 (d) is that the content is known and its probative value is weighted against its prejudicial value.<p>

The tribunal did not immediately rule on the issue.<p>

Meanwhile, the prosecution indicated it will conclude its case by mid-August.<p>

The day's testimony came from Sead Halvadzic, who was from Prejidor and in the army from March 1991 until May 1992. After learning Prejidor had fallen to the Serbs, he left to fight for Bosnia-Herzegovina. But he was captured by Serb reserves in June 1992.<p>

He eventually was sent to Omarska. But, before arriving at the camp, he was detained for a few days in the military barracks at Prejidor. Halvadzic said he was beaten by two military police members, one of whom was called "Tadic."<p>

Four years later, he viewed several photos presented by the prosecution and identified Tadic as one of his attackers.<p>

Defense attorney Steven Kay accused the witness of selecting Tadic because he had seen his image on television and in the newspapers. The witness denied it.<p>

JULY 17<br>
Two more witnesses placed Dusko Tadic at the Omarska prison camp.<p>

One witness, a Muslim survivor of Omarska, testified that he saw Tadic walk behind the "white house" of the camp where dead bodies were piled up and disposed of the following day.<p>

Another witness, who has known Tadic for 20 years, said he saw the defendant beat several prisoners at the camp.<p>

Meanwhile, the tribunal announced that it will rule next week on a defense motion relating to hearsay evidence.<p>

The defense wants the court to exclude all hearsay evidence unless the prosecution can demonstrate why it should be admitted. The current rule at the tribunal favors the admissibility of hearsay evidence, that is, all hearsay evidence comes in unless the defense can demonstrate why it should not. That, the defense argued, is unfair. The defense argued it can't cross-examine the person who allegedly made the statement or test its truthfulness. The prosecution contended the defense was trying to significantly change the burden and terms of admissibility.<p>

JULY 18<br>
Three more witnesses testified against Dusko Tadic with the most damaging evidence coming from a Muslim survivor of the Omarska prison camp who had known Tadic for several years.<p>

Edin Mrkalj, a 24-year-old Muslim originally from a village within the municipality of Prijedor, was trained as a policeman in Sarajevo from 1979-1984. He then worked for three years in the federal police headquarters in Belgrade. At the beginning of 1988, he returned to Prejidor and worked as a policeman there until April 1992.<p>

By the time Mrkalj was sent to Omarska in June, he had known Tadic for at least a year. They met at a meeting of policemen in Prejidor. After that, the witness said he saw Tadic several times in Prejidor and once in Kozarac.<p>

On June 16, 1992, Mrkalj and a young prisoner were asked to enter the administration building at Omarska to remove a dead body. As the two got to the top of the stairs to what is referred to as the first floor, they kept their faces down and their hands behind their backs (as traditionally told to do). Mrkalj heard laughter, then the other prisoner was hit and fell down. When he came to, he was told to go downstairs.<p>

Then, someone put a baton under Mrkalj's chin and lifted his head. Mrkalj said he found himself face-to-face with Tadic. He said he did not expect to be hit because Tadic turned away but then he was struck unexpectedly by Tadic on the head. Tadic then asked him why he was there. Mrkalj said he answered Tadic's questions. Tadic then ordered him to hold out his hands and asked which hand Mrkalj wrote with. When Mrkalj said his right hand, Tadic started to beat the hand with a rubber baton. Another man came and joined in the beating. At one point, the baton fell to the floor and Tadic told Mrkalj to pick it up and hand it to him saying "here you are Mr. Serb." Mrkalj said he had no choice, he knelt down to pick up the baton and handed it over as instructed.<p>

Not yet standing up, Mrkalj said Tadic then placed the barrel of an automatic rifle in his mouth. Tadic held the rifle on his left shoulder. Mrkalj said Tadic and the other man beat him senseless while the gun remained in his mouth. <p>

At the end of the direct examination, the witness was asked to identify Tadic in court. He pointed to the defendant and said, "that is the garbage over there." The witness was immediately chastised by the judge.<p>

On cross-examination, defense attorney Steven Kay attacked the reliability of the witnesses' identification of Tadic. Despite the fact that the men knew each other, Tadic never called Mrkalj by his name nor did Mrkalj refer to Tadic by name before, during or after the beating. <p>

JULY 19<br>
Suada Ramic, a 41-year-old woman from Prijedor, testified about what life was like for women held at the Omarska prison camp.<p>

She said women routinely were called out in the night but the women never discussed what happened to them. She said she was raped during the five times she was called out. Because of injuries related to the rapes, she had to have a hysterectomy when she was released from the camp.<p>

The defense did not cross-examine the witness because Ramic did not directly implicate Dusko Tadic during her testimony.<p>

The next witness, Emid Beganovic, did testify about Tadic's actions at the camp.<p>

Beganovic, a Muslim businessman from Prijedor, had known Tadic for about 10 years before Omarska. At the camp, he was called out for what the prosecutor referred to as three "special" beatings.<p>

The witness said Tadic participated in the third beating. Tadic and several other Serbs in uniforms beat him with their boots, metal rods and cables for 20-30 minutes.<p>

Beganovic suffered multiple skull fractures, a broken nose, spine and kidney injuries, and has lost most of the use of his left hand.<p>

On cross-examination, defense attorney Steven Kay dealt with the obvious. Since Tadic did not participate in the first two beatings, perhaps Beganovic's perception was affected and he could not make a positive identification of anyone who beat him on the third occasion. Beganovic insisted he was mentally alert enough to recognize Tadic. "The other faces meant nothing to me because I did not recognize them," he said.<p>

Developments in the war crimes trial of Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic from July 22-26, 1996.<p>


JULY 22<BR>
The tribunal was not in session.<p>

JULY 23<BR>
Three survivors of the Omarska detention camp testified about Dusko Tadic's role in the beating and torture of prisoners there. <p>


Senad Muslimovic, a Muslim, described beatings he received at the hands of Tadic. He said he was forced to kneel on the floor while Tadic held his head and put a knife to his throat. He was not cut badly. But Tadic threatened to slice his ear off. <p>

Armin Kenjar, a reserve policeman from Tadic's hometown of Kozarac, said that when he was growing up he idolized Tadic because of  Tadic's karate expertise. He compared Tadic to a cowboy. Kenjar was later held at Omarska, where he said he saw Tadic. From a nearby room, he said he heard Tadic and other Serbs attack a prisoner. He described "screams, wailing . . . cries of pain . . . it was really horrible, a nightmare . . . It must have been a massacre in the worst way possible." <p>

Mehmed Alic, an elderly Muslim man, said he knew the Tadic family for most of his life and was friendly with Tadic's family. After an attack in his hometown, he said he saw Tadic wearing a camouflage uniform. He was taken to Omarska, where he said  he saw Tadic twice. "It was always very quickly, but Dule [Dusko] Tadic is Dule [Dusko] Tadic . . I would know him. I know him, I know his build like myself . . . There is no question."<p>

Tadic has denied mistreating prisoners in the detention camp. He claims to be the victim of mistaken identity. <p>

JULY 24<br>
The defense questioned Mehmed Alic's testimony that he saw Dusko Tadic at Omarska. Attorney Steven Kay suggested that Alic's head was down or turned away most of the time -- that the circumstances surrounding his alleged sightings of Tadic prevented him from making an accurate identification.<p>

The next witness, Halid Mujkanovic, a Muslim survivor of Omarska from Kozarac, testified that he has known Tadic most of his life. After surrendering to Serb forces after the attack on Kozarac, he was taken to Omarska. When asked about the conditions there, he said, "hunger, scabies, lice, dysentery...impossible condition." He said prisoners were beaten every day, sometimes singled out or individual or special beatings.<p>

Mujkanovic recalled the time a Serb soldier beat him and threatened to continue the lashings until the prisoner could come up with a certain amount of money. When Mujkanovic failed to do so, he was beaten again.<p>

He testified that he saw Tadic inside the camp on two separate occasion. But he was unable to connect Tadic with any specific criminal acts.<p>


JULY 25<br>
Testimony focused on allegations that Dusko Tadic and other Serbs at the Omarska detention camp ordered a prisoner to bite off the genitals of another prisoner.<p>

Muharem Besic, a Muslim survivor of Omarska, said he saw Tadic at the camp. While Besic said he heard the wails of the victim, he could not say whether Tadic was involved in the mutilation incident.<p>

Husein Hodzic, another prisoner at the camp at the time of the incident, also said he heard the screams of the victim. And like Besic, he could no connect Tadic to the crime. <p>

Hodzic also testified that a fellow prisoner, Emir Karabasic, told him upon seeing the Tadic in the camp, "Dule has arrived. I'm finished. (Dule is a nickname for Dusko.) <p>


JULY 26<BR>
The direct examination of Armin Mujcic, who previously testified that he was born and raised in Kozarac and knew Dusko Tadic most of his life, continued as he told the court of what he saw at the Omarska prison camp.<p>

Mujcic said when he arrived at Omarska, "people were lined up and beaten by the guards. It was impossible not to be beaten." He was placed with others in an overcrowded room and often not permitted to use the toilet.<p>

At one point during his detention, Mujcic described how he was running to his room when he turned around and saw Tadic in a camouflage uniform. Mujcic said later that day, he witnessed a group of Serb guards, including Tadic, beating two other prisoners. This was the incident when prosecutors claim Tadic and other Serbs ordered a prisoner to bite off the genitals of another prisoner.<p>

"I thought we were all going to br tortured like this," Mujcic told the tribunal. "I wished they would just kill me with a bullet, it would be easier."<p>

But during an effective cross-examination, Mujcic seemed to retreat from his testimony.<p>

Defense attorney Steven Kay, questioning with witness's alleged observation of Tadic, suggested that Mujcic only heard rumors that Tadic was in the camp.<p>

"What I'm suggesting to you is that you've made it up and that it was Tadic," Kay asked. Mujcic at first denied the allegation but soon after conceded that his belief that Tadic was Omarska may have been based on what he heard from other prisoners.<p>

Elvir Grozdanic, a former Muslim reserve policeman and former student of the defendant, testified that he was held at Omarska for 72 days. <p>

He said he saw Tadic in the camp on three separate occasions. The first time, he said, Tadic "came up to me, grabbed my face, and asked me if I had been on the Muslim police force." Grozdanic testified that he lied to Tadic and was left alone. Another time, he said, he saw Tadic beating some prisoners. The third time he saw Tadic in the camp, the defendant was carrying a fire extinguisher and "shoved the hose into the mouth of a prisoner."<p>

On cross-examination, defense attorney Sylvia Bertodano challenged Grozdanic's testimony about seeing Tadic in the camp.<p>

At one point, she said: "What I'm suggesting is this, that you didn't see Dusko Tadic at all on that day...that you heard afterward from other prisoners and reports in the media about what had happened in the camp, and you made up this story that you yourself had seen Dusko Tadic."<p>

Grozdanic replied, "thank you very much for all this, and for all this trust you are showing. After all those atrocities, I am quite ready to take Dusko Tadic's place, and for him to see here, if I have said a single lie."<p>

Developments in the war crimes trial of Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic from July 29-August 2, 1996.<p>


July 29<br>
The tribunal was not in session.<p>

July 30 <br>
Two witnesses testified that Dusko Tadic beat them inside the Omarska prison camp.<p>

The testimony of one of the witnesses, Hakija Elezovic, was some of the most persuasive of the trial as he was able to point directly at Tadic as his assailant.<p>

Elezovic, a Muslim born near Trnopolje, said he knew Tadic from sight, but "up until the conflict, didn't really know him." On July 9, 1992, he said he was taken to the Trnopolje prison camp where he said he  witnessed the fatal shooting of his son, Samir. Elezovic said he was later taken to the Keraterm prison camp -- it as here that he first encountered Tadic. Elezovich said Tadic beat him and kicked him "with a master's kick."<p>

Elezovich testified that he was later transferred to Omarska where he once again fell victim to Tadic. Elezovich first witnessed Tadic beating several prisoners, including his other son, Salih, who later died. Elezovich quoted Tadic as saying, "Now, you've come to the right place," as he was beating Salih Elezovich. Then, the witness testified, Tadic began to beat and kick him in a manner similar to the assault at Keraterm.<p>

Another prisoner, Hase Icic, also offered incriminating evidence against Tadic.<p>

Icic, a Muslim, testified that he had known Tadic for most of his life. Shortly after the Serb attack on Kozarac, he was transferred to the Keraterm prison camp and eventually sent to Omarska. Icic said that shortly after he arrived at the camp, he witnessed Serb guards beating prisoners and once saw them using knives to carve crosses on the backs of prisoners. <p>

Icic said that at one point during his detention, Serb guards pulled him into a room. When he looked up, he saw Tadic was among the group. Icic said one of the men (he did not say if it was Tadic) put a noose around his neck, pulled it tight and then hit him on the back. Icic soon lost consciousness.<p>

Another time, Icic said he saw Tadic and another man throw a beaten-up man into a room. "Now you'll remember ... that you cannot touch a Serb or say anything to a Serb," Icic said Tadic told the victim."<p>

On cross-examination, defense attorney Steven Kay suggested Icic was confusing Tadic with another Serb guard whose nickname also is Dule. Kay point out that, in a prior statement about his experience in Omarska, Icic wrote he heard Tadic but never saw him.<p>

The tribunal also released the transcript of the testimony of Witness "H," who testified last week in closed session. The prosecution contends that Tadic and other Serbs at Omarska forced the witness and another prisoner to sexuallyt mutilate a third prisoner. But Witness "H" did not and could not implicate Tadic in the incident.<p>

July 31<br>
The prosecution shifted its focus to the counts in the indictment accusing Dusko Tadic of killing five Muslim men and beating eight others in two villages near Kozarac in June of 1992.<p>

The most important testimony of the day came from Drajuni Jaskic, the wife of one of Tadic's alleged victims.<p>

She testified that she was living with her husband in Jaskici on June 14, 1992, when the Serbs took over the village. She said three Serb soliders came to her house that day and called out most of the male members of her family. Jaskic said that at one point, she looked out her window and saw Tadic chasing two Muslim men.<p>

Then, she said, she saw "Dule Tadic beat my family, my husband, my father, my brother, my uncle, my whole family." Jaskic said it was the last time she saw her father, husband and brother.<p>

Near the end of her testimony, she admitted to the court that when tribunal investigators interviewed her last year and showed her a set of photographs including one of Tadic, she said she did not recognize anyone even though she did recognize Tadic. When asked why she did this, Jaskic said, "I was afraid."<p>

August 1<br>
Dusko Tadic and several other armed Bosnian Serbs stormed into the Bosnian villages of Jaskici and Sivci on June 14, 1992, killing five Muslim men and beating eight others, according to three witnesses who survived the attacks.<P>

Prosecutors are using the testimony of Zemha Sahbaz, Senija Elkasovic and Vasif Gutic to support counts 29 to 34 of Tadic's indictment.<P>

Sahbaz, a Muslim woman from Jaskici, said that a man in a camouflage uniform threatened her and ordered Serbs from the town to beat Muslims. Through the use of a photo identification, she identified Tadic as that uniformed man.<P>

Another Muslim woman from Jaskici, Elkasovic, said she had known Tadic for 15 years. When she saw him that June 14, he was standing in front of her home in a camouflage uniform. Another uniformed Serb ordered her and her family to lay on the floor. She heard a soldier threaten to cut the throat of anyone who looked in her direction.<P>

Elkasovic said she did not see Tadic engage in any violent acts. But when she left her home, dead bodies were scattered about the town. She has not since seen or heard from her husband, brother or brother-in-law.<p>

Gutic, a medical student from Kozarac, said he was arrested on the day he was to take one of his last exams before graduating. He said he had known Tadic for quite a while and became aware that Tadic's cafe began barring Muslims sometime prior to the Serb attack on Kozarac in May 1992. <p>

August 2<br>
The tribunal was not in session.<p>

Developments in the war crimes trial of Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic from August  5-9, 1996.<p>

August 5<br>
The court was not in session.<P>

August 6<br>

The prosecution started to present evidence of alleged war crimes committed by Dusko Tadic inside the Trnopolje and Keraterm prison camps.<p>

Vasif Gutic, a former medical student, continued his testimony about the horrid conditions inside the Trnopolje camp. He explained that the majority of those held in the camp were women and that rape was a common occurrence. He said he even treated a rape victim who was only 12 1/2 years old. <p>

On August 11, 1992, Gutic testified, that the International Red Cross camp to the camp and "circumstances there changed radically." The Red Cross brought "food, medicine and hope of rescue from the hell we were living in," he said. On October 1, the Red Cross organized a relocation of the prisoners out of the camp. Gutic said the prisoners, however, were required to sign an agreement relinquishing their property and promising not to return to Republica Srpska.<p>

Gutic testified that at some point (he did not know the date) he saw Tadic at the camp. He said Tadic was standing in front of the building in which the Red Cross was housed, talking to the camp's deputy commander Slavko Puhalic. Gutic said Tadic and Puhalic were looking over  piece of paper which the witness believed was a list of Muslims from Kozarac being sought by the Serbs.<p>

On cross-examination, defense attorney Steven Kay challenged Gutic's identification of Tadic and the piece of paper. Gutic admitted that he was some distance away from Tadic at the time. <p>

"What I suggest is that this simply isn't true. You didn't see Tadic looking at anything," Kay said. Gutic disagreed.<p>

The tribunal also heard from Sefik Kesic, a survivor of all three prison camps -- Omarska, Keraterm and Trnopolje. While he was at Keraterm, he said Tadic interrogated and beat him.<p>

August 7<br>


Several witnesses testified about instances in which Dusko Tadic demonstrated a deep-seated antagonism toward Muslims. But none of the witnesses connected Tadic to any crime with which he is charged. Two other witnesses placed Tadic in the prison camps and testified that he was considered by his Serb allies to be the chief commander of the special police force in his hometown of Kozarac.<p>


August 8<br>

The prosecution continued to present evidence about Dusko Tadic's actions at the Trnopolje detention camp.<P>

Mustafa Mujkanovic, a Muslim from the village of Trnopolje who was detained in the camp, saw he saw Tadic near the camp on two occasions. He also said a Serb friend of his in the village told him Tadic was known to hold tow positions: secretary of the local commune of Kozarac and police commander. <p>

On cross-examination, the witness admitted he did not see Tadic inside the camp nor did he see him beat anyone. Defense attorney Steven Kay also suggested that  Mujkanovic's identification of Tadic outside the camp was tainted by his having viewed a video documentary about prison camps in which Tadic appears.<p>

Another witness, Jusaf Arifagic, said he saw Tadic in police uniform in the camp when it was being dissolved in late September 1992. But Arifagic, a Muslim from Kozarac who knew Tadic, did not connect the defendant to any crime.<p>

August 9<br>

The tribunal judges continued to hear testimony about the horrors of ethnic cleansing. But none of the witnesses identified Dusko Tadic as the man who committed what the world now calls war crimes.<p>

So why all the testimony about someone else's crimes? First, the prosecution is trying to preempt the expected alibi defense. Tadic is expected to say he wasn't in the prison camps. It was  someone else. So, the more witnesses who say they saw him at the Omarska, Keraterm and Trnopolje camps, the better for the prosecution.<p>

The witnesses corroborated the various atrocities at the camps -- camps which the prosecution claims Tadic helped to run. And, the witnesses said, Tadic was armed, he was wearing camouflage and he was hanging out with the guards when Muslims were forced out of Prijedor and into the camps. The evidence may support the prosecution's claim that Tadic was in a superior position to the guards and perhaps even the commanders.<p>

Another reason for the testimony may be because the prosecution must show that at the time of Tadic's alleged crimes there was a "systematic attack directed against a civilian population" -- and that Tadic knew he was participating in the attack. The witnesses said Tadic watched them board the buses to take them out of Prijedor, he was at the camps, he knew he was watching ethnic cleansing and he participated.<p>

Bahrija Denic, a Muslim from Kozarac, said he saw Tadic in the village shortly before the Serb attack on the town. Denic said he also saw Tadic on October 1, 1992, when he was leaving the Trnopolje camp. Tadic, he said, was wearing a solid blue police uniform. He did not testify that he saw Tadic engage in any criminal activity.<p>

Eniz Besic said he was in front of his home when the Serbs attacked Kozarac on May 24, 1992. He and his neighbors retreated to the forest for a few days before surrendering three days later.<p>

Besic eventually was detained in the Trnopolje camp, where he was interrogated on three separate occasions and beaten if his inquisitors did not like his answers. As a result of the beatings, he suffered broken ribs and kidney damage. <p>

Besic said he had known Tadic for 10 years. "He was a man who was well respected  in Kozarac," he said. While in the Trnopolje camp, Besic saw Tadic on two separate instances. Once, about a month after he arrived at the camp, Besic saw Tadic in a "multi-colored military uniform" talking to a guard outside the grounds of the camp. Tadic was carrying an automatic rifle, he said. The second time Besic saw Tadic was about a week later, again in the company of guards just outside the camp. This time, Besic said, Tadic was in civilian clothes.<p>

On cross-examination, he admitted he was never a friend of Tadic's and when he saw the defendant in Kozarac, it was juts in passing. He also conceded that when he said he saw Tadic outside the camp, he looked at him for only a brief period of time.<p>

Samic Hodzic, a 26-year-old from a hamlet just outside of Trnopolje, said he knew Tadic as a karate instructor and cafe owner but never socialized with him. Hodzic said he saw Tadic just a few days before the attack on Kozarac.<p>

On July 9, 1992, Hodzic, his father and his uncle were forced to join a column, the members of which were taken to the Trnopolje camp. His uncle was called out of the column and he never saw him again.<p>

Hodzic was then transferred to the Omarska camp where he was held in the "white house." While there, a fellow prisoner twice was called out of his room. The prisoner, Hakija Elezovic, is listed in the indictment as one of Tadic's victims.<p>

At some later point, Hodzic was outside the "white house" when he saw a group of guards including Tadic. The guards, he said, required him to turn over a pile of bodies lying face down near the  "white house." One body, Hodzic said, may have been Sejad Sivac, another one of Tadic's alleged victims. Another was Elezovic's son, Salih. However, Hodzic said he did not see Elezovic behind the "white house" with the other dead men.<p>

On cross-examination, attorney Steven Kay questioned Hodzic about not seeing Elezovic. The testimony is important because Elezovic testified on July 30 that he had been beaten and left for dead behind the "white house." He also said he was there when Hodzic turned over the bodies. In fact, Elezovic said he passed out from a beating and that was why he wasn't killed. He also described Hodzic taking Salih's shoes and said he first asked Elezovic's permission.<p>

But Hodzic testified that he did take the shoes but did not see Elezovic there and did not discuss with him taking the shoes.<p>

With this testimony, the defense may have undermined Hodzic and Elezovic's testimony. <p>

Developments in the war crimes trial of Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic from August 12-15, 1996.<p>

August 12<br>
The tribunal was not in session.<p>

August 13<br>
Prosecutors presented witnesses who claimed that Dusko Tadic was in Bosnian Serb prison camps dressed to kill.<p>

That is, Tadic was dressed like other special police and prison guards -- in camouflage shirt and solid color pants -- talking with other camp officials and watching Muslims file into death chambers.<p>

These witnesses did not testify that they saw Tadic beating, torturing or killing Muslims. Prosecutors are apparently using this testimony to establish that Tadic had a substantial role in the vast effort by Serbs to eradicate Bosnia's Muslim population.<p>

Witness S, whose identity is being protected by the court, testified that for decades he was Tadic's next door neighbor. "Look at me," he said to Tadic when asked to  identify the defendant. "We know each other very well," he told the court.<p>

S, a 56-year-old retired baker, was born in Kozarak and served in the army from 1958 to 1960 in Sarajevo and Montenegro. He was taken prisoner after Kozarak was attacked in May 1992 and tormented by a man who threatened to behead him.<p>

At the Keraterm camp, he was interrogated twice. The second time, he was beaten until his jaw broke and his teeth fell out. S did not implicate Tadic in the beating or killing. But he did see Tadic arrive in a squad car and dressed in uniform. <p>

Emud Velic, a 24-year-old Muslim from a village near Kozarac, frequented Tadic's bar. He became a prisoner at the Omarska camp, where he was crowded into a small detention area and starved. He was forced to clean human skin, hair and blood from his cell walls and ordered to tell journalists that he had been there no more than 15 days, that there were no beatings, and that he ate four times a week. These were all lies, he said.<p>

Velic claimed that he saw Tadic enter a hanger. He said he heard the name "Jasmin Hrnic" called out and then saw Tadic and Hrnic leave the area. Then he heard horrible screams. This alleged beating relates to counts 5-11 of Tadic's indictment, the most serious of which is the sexual mutilation of a prisoner.<p>

On cross-examination, defense attorney Steven Kay pointed out inconsistencies in Velic's testimony compared with statements he gave police. In the earlier account, Velic said he hear another prisoner's name called while at the hanger. Kay suggested that Velic heard stories about the sexual mutilation and killing and made up his own story to implicate Tadic.<p>

August 14<br>
The day's proceedings were held behind closed doors to protect the identity of Witness L, who is expected to be the prosecution's final witness. Witness L was a guard at the Trnopolje camp and he was convicted of "serious crimes" by a court in Bosnia-Herzegovina.<p>

August 15<br>
After 47 days of testimony from 75 witnesses, the prosecution rested its case against Dusko Tadic.<p>

The prosecution ended its case with a final attempt to show that Tadic played a major role in Serbian politics. They introduced documents showing that Tadic was the party representative of the Kozarac region for the SDS. Another document showed "a decision on the relocation of residents of the local Kozarac commune," dated August 1992 and signed by Tadic. <p>

The prosecution will argue Tadic was an important figure in local Serb politics, and most likely that the relocation of the Kozarac commune referred to the relocation of Muslims. The defense concedes Tadic dabbled in politics. But the defense contends he did not participate in ethnic cleansing, and being active in local politics, does not make him a murderer.<p>

Grant McIntosh, an investigator for the prosecution, testified about a trip to Prijedor last week. While there, he took photographs of a building and a basketball court at the Trnopolje prison camp. He also went to the Omarska camp and photographed parts of the hanger building. McIntosh testified that things seemed much closer in real life than they do in videotapes of the camps. <p>

The prosecution then introduced the documents that German police seized from Tadic's house in Germany when he was arrested in 1994. The document include Tadic's statements to German police. In the statement, Tadic claimed he "never set foot" in Omarska.<p>

The tribunal will be in recess until September 10. <p>

In the meantime, the defense will be in Bosnia getting witnesses for its case. The defense's biggest hurdle may be getting witnesses to testify. They say the people in Bosnia are terrified of the tribunal and believe they will be arrested if they come to The Hague to testify. The defense is awaiting a ruling by the judges on protective measures they can take for their witnesses. <p>

Developments in the war crimes trial of Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic from Sept. 9-13, 1996.<p>
<P><B>September 10</B><BR>
After a three-week break following the prosecution resting its case, the
defense of Dusko Tadic began with a motion to dismiss most of the charges.</P>

<P>This motion took the tribunal into uncharted territory. Under the court's
rules of procedure, there are no provisions for such a motion. Prosecutors
argued that the motion ought not to be considered for this reason. The defense
replied that fundamental justice demanded that an accused be cleared of
baseless charges as soon as possible.</P>

<P>In his argument to the court, defense lawyer Michail Wladimiroff took a new
tack on the evidence against Tadic. Up to this point, the defense has been
claiming Tadic wasn't at the places where witnesses say he committed war
crimes. But as the prosecution evidence came in, it turned out that many of the
witnesses who place Tadic at the scene of crimes don't actually identify him as
an active participant.</P>

<P>This evidence, Wladimiroff said, does not show Tadic actually committed
crimes. It is not enough to show that Tadic was there, he said. Prosecutors
must show that he did something.</P>

<P>Judge Gabrielle McDonald told the lawyers there would be a decision
Wednesday or Thursday.</P>

<B><P>Defense Witness 1: Robert M. Hayden<BR></B>
A professor of anthropology at the University of Pittsburgh, Hayden was called
as a policy witness, to refute the prosecution expert, James Gow, on the origin
of the war in Bosnia.</P>

<P>The war was a byproduct of the break-up of Yugoslavia, he said. His
description of the conflict as a domestic civil war, rather than an
international war, supports the defense position that international law ought
not apply in this case. His testimony will continue Sept. 11.</P>

<P><B>September 11</B><BR>
Robert Hayden, a cultural anthropologist and constitutional lawyer, took the
court through the history of the war in Bosnia.</P>

<P>In the prosecution's version, Serbia, one of six constituent republics,
embarked on a vast land-grab led by Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic. He
ignited the tinderbox of Serbian nationalism to consolidate his own power, and
then -- part leading, part following a mass movement -- he sought to create a
"Greater Serbia," by tearing chunks of territory from other republics, plunging
Yugoslavia into war and wrecking the federation.</P>

<P>Robert Hayden came to court on behalf of Dusko Tadic with a very different
story to tell. He begins with a question: What would come after state socialism
in Yugoslavia? After Marshal Tito died in 1981, and the failure of socialist
economics became evident, the pressing issue was how the Balkans would organize
themselves.</P>

<P>The answer, Hayden said, was tragic. The people of Yugoslavia chose --
fairly and freely -- to partition themselves into ethnically exclusive cantons.
And when it came time for Bosnia's turn to decide, the people of that divided
land made the same choice -- with horrible results.</P>

<P>The Serbs, Croats, Slovenes and Muslims all embarked on the path of
destruction. </P>

<P>This balance in his account was turned against him on cross-examination when
prosecutor Grant Nieman cited passages from Hayden's writing that  seemed to
confirm the prosecution's version of events.</P>

<P><B>September 12-13</B><BR>
Court was not in session.</P>

Developments in the war crimes trial of Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic from Sept. 16-20, 1996.<p>
<B><P>September 16<BR></B>
Court was in recess.

<B><P>September 17<BR></B>
Judges rejected the defense motion to dismiss some of the charges against Tadic, ruling that they would wait until the end of the trial to decide whether the prosecution has proven the charges against Tadic beyond a reasonable doubt. </P>

<P>Later in the day, the first Croat witness to testify on behalf of Tadic took the stand.
<P></P> 
Witness U, a Croat who married to a Serb, lived in Kozarac for 42 years before the war and knew Tadic's family for some 30 years. </P>

<P>When Kozarac was shelled in May 1992, U sought shelter in the hills above Kozarac. He was taken out of the city with thousands of other people, mostly Muslims. Many Serb soldiers organized the exodus. But Tadic among them, U said.</P>

<P>U claimed that Tadic's political position after the attack was a result of his enthusiasm for rebuilding Kozarac. Tadic was elected secretary of the local commune. U insisted Tadic was given such a post because he was one of the most fervent supporters of returning to the city. U said he knew nothing about Tadic being politically tied to the Serb military or to the people who ran the prison camps in northern Bosnia. </P>

<P>On cross-examination, the prosecution pointed out that the board Tadic sat on was the one that decided who could come back to Kozarac. Currently,  there are virtually no Muslims there and few Croats. The rest of Kozarac is composed of Serbs, many of whom live in homes once occupied by Muslims. U obtained one of those houses. At first, he said the Muslims who lived there died "in the operations." But then he recanted that statement, saying he knows nothing about what happened to the family. </P>

<P>Prosecutor Michael Keegan also tried to show that witness U profited from the attack on Kozarac. He accused U of owing a lot of money to the people of Kozarac. He said that when U delivered their pensions in the mail, he then would ask for loans. Keegan suggested U never paid back the money and that his creditors were searching for him. Keegan accused U and his wife of looting from their neighbors after the attack on Kozarac. U denied all of this.</P>

<B><P>September 18<BR></B></P>
Court was held for only a half day in closed session. Witness U has finished testifying and that Witness W is on the stand now. According to the tribunal press office, W will continue to testify in closed session all day Sept. 19.</P>

<P>The only information released about these witnesses is that they are from somewhere in the former Yugoslavia. We do not know if they are Croats, Muslims or Serbs, although it is doubtful they are Muslims. Neither the defense nor the people in the tribunal office will say if the witnesses are male or female or if they are alibi witnesses</P>

<P><B>September 19</B><BR>
Witness W, whose identity is being protected by the tribunal, continued to testify in closed session.</P>

<P><B>September 20</B><BR>
Witness W testified in closed session.</P>

Developments in the war crimes trial of Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic from Sept.
23-27, 1996.<p>
<P><B>Monday Sept. 23</B><br>
Court was in recess.</P>

<P><B>Tuesday Sept. 24</B><BR>
Defense attorneys won one of their most important battles: prosecutors will not
be entitled to written statements of defense witnesses.</P>

<P>After listening to the lawyers argue for a full day, tribunal judges took
ten minutes to deliver their precedent-setting decision in declaring that "such
statements are privileged." </P>

<P>The defense has vehemently defended the privacy of its witnesses's
statements. Those witnesses, the defense said,  fear arrest and prosecution by
the tribunal. They spoke only after defense attorneys promised they would not
disclose the statements. The ruling also clears the way for defense attorneys
in future cases to assure prospective witnesses their interviews will be
private.</P>

<P>Presiding Judge Gabrielle McDonald made it clear from the bench that she
dissented from the ruling. The only American on the panel, she instead voted in
favor of reciprocal discovery -- a system unique to the United States. She was
outvoted 2-1. </P>

<P>Both sides spent the day citing laws and rules from courts all over the
world. Quickly, it became clear that almost all justice systems throughout the
world do not recognize a reciprocal discovery rule. The United States was the
only exception attorneys and judges could find. </P>

<P>Defense attorneys argued that in civil systems and common law systems other
than the U.S., reciprocal discovery is unheard of. The defense said
communications between a defense lawyer and prospective witnesses are
privileged in the same way attorney-client communications are privileged.
Defense attorney Michail Wladimiroff contended an attorney is simply an
extension of his client, making all communications with third parties
privileged. </P>

<P>But the prosecution said once that third party takes the stand, the
privilege is waived and any prior statement is fair game. In the U.S., those
types of statements commonly are used for impeachment purposes. For example, if
a witness' prior statement is inconsistent with what he says on stand,
attorneys can use that prior statement to question his credibility. But
Wladimiroff said that no civil system on the European continent recognizes
impeachment evidence as relevant in a trial.</P>

<B><P>Wednesday Sept 25<BR></B>
For the first time in open session, the defense called alibi witnesses. </P>

<P>As of yet, we have no idea what other witnesses have said behind closed doors. But judging from the first two alibi witnesses in open session, the alibi defense is taking shape slowly. </P>

<P>Witness X And Dragolje Balta  both said Tadic was living in Banja Luka the day his hometown Kozarac fell to Bosnian Serbs. Prosecutors had alleged Tadic took part  in the May 24, 1992 attack on Kozarac and helped expel the Muslims living there.  But according to X and Balta, Tadic was 25 miles away at Banja Luka.</P>

<P>They said Tadic left Kozarac because of the attack. Witness X, who has been a friend of Tadic's family for 20 years, said Tadic told her he did not want to participate in the conflict. X said Tadic was depressed and complained he did not want to put on a uniform and attack his neighbors. She also said Tadic stayed in Banja Luka until the end of June or early July.</P>

<P>X's claim contradicts prosecution testimony, which places Tadic spent at three prison camps -- Keraterm, Omarska and Trnopolje -- all about 25 miles from Banja Luka. She also said she never saw Tadic act strange, never saw him in military garb, never saw him with a weapon.</P>

<P>Dragolje Balta, a Bosnian Serb locksmith, repeated that Tadic stayed in Banja Luka at least through the beginning of July 1992. Balta said Tadic and his family moved into the basement of the house next door to his. He said he asked Tadic why he moved to Banja Luka, and that Tadic responded that there was trouble in Kozarac and he had to leave. </P>

<P>Prosecutors say Tadic was in Kozarac during the attack, and that he helped expel a "column of Muslims," who were kicked out of their houses. But the defense still has not established that Tadic was not at the prison camps during the time prosecutors say he was. Several prosecution witnesses detailed very specific instances when they saw Tadic at the camps. The defense has yet to show Tadic was somewhere else during those specific incidents. </P>

<P>Defense attorneys have complained their task is harder in this case than in most, for this reason: the alibi is not for one day, as in most murder cases. This is an alibi that must stretch across months. </P>

<P>On cross-examination, prosecutors suggested the witnesses are biased. Witness X was a friend to both Tadic and his wife. And Dragolje Balta is a Serb. Prosecutors and defense attorneys have said they will argue the other side's witnesses are biased because of their ethnic backgrounds. Most of the prosecution's witnesses were Muslims; most of the defense witnesses are expected to be Serb. Both sides most likely will stress in argument that the ethnic divide in Bosnia is as wide as ever, and that the credibility of the witnesses in this trial is tainted by the tension.</P>

<P><B>Thursday Sept. 26</B><BR>
No session.</P>

<P><B>Friday Sept. 27</B><BR>
No session.</P>

Developments in the war crimes trial of Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic from Sept.
30-Oct. 3 1996.<p>

[EDITOR'S NOTE: The tribunal was not in session from Sept. 27 to Oct. 1.]
<HR WIDTH=525 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>October 2</B><BR>
Defense attorneys began to try to chip away at a timeline during which prosecutors say Dusko Tadic was committing war crimes.</P>

<P>Three witnesses traveled from Bosnia to testify about where they thought Tadic was between May and Aug. 1992, when prosecutors say he raped, murdered and killed inmates at the three Serb-run prison camps in Northern Bosnia.</P>

<P>The most compelling of the evidence was a stack of documents from the Prijedor police department. They showed Tadic worked at a traffic checkpoint in Prijedor from June to August 1992. The documents say Tadic worked almost every day between six and 12 hours a day from June 16 to August 2.</P>

<P>The documents were introduced through the testimony of  Miroslav Brdar. He said he worked with Tadic during all his shifts at the checkpoint. He said while they were working, Tadic's whereabouts were known at all times. Brdar said Tadic would not have been able to take the police car assigned to them, because they had to report mileage every day.</P>

<P>Clearly, the defense is trying to establish that Tadic spent so much time guarding the checkpoint, he had no time to be at the camps during the dozens of incidents prosecution witnesses reported.</P>

<P>But on cross-examination, prosecutor Alan Tieger pointed out that the checkpoint was only a few kilometers away from the camps. He also pointed out that the same police department in charge of the checkpoint was manning the camps.</P>

<P>Brdar's insisted he didn't know thousands of Muslims were killed at the camps, nor was he aware that about 50,000 Muslims were "cleansed" from Prijedor. Tieger looked incredulous as the witness said this, suggesting that it is implausible that a Serb working for the Serbian police to not know about the ethnic cleansing going on all around him.</P>

<P><B>Other Highlights:</B></P>
<P><B>October 3</B><BR>
In her first press conference as the tribunal's new chief prosecutor, Canadian Appellate Judge Louise Arbour said one of her main goals will be to assure the arrests of everyone charged with war crimes in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. </P>

<P>When asked how she would apprehend former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and military chief Ratko Mladic, she repeatedly said she would "use the measures available" without further explanation. </P>

<P>Unlike her predecessor, Justice Richard Goldstone, whom she replaced Oct. 1, she did not lambaste the United Nations. However, she pointed out that her trouble lies in the fact that an international tribunal does not have its own law enforcement infrastructure and must depend on the UN and the individual states.</P>

<P>She expressed hope that her job would be more legal than political. </P>

<P>In court, the tribunal heard the testimony of three more witnesses who claimed that Dusko Tadic was working at a police checkpoint in Prijedor from June to August 1992, a period of time, according to the prosecution, when Tadic committed war crimes at three prison camps.</P>

<P><B>Rajko Karanovic</B>, a Serb truck driver who delivered food to the troops in Kozarac for 40 days from the end of May through the beginning of July 1992, said he passed through Tadic's checkpoint three or four times a day and frequently saw Tadic on duty. </P>

<P>Karanovic also said he delivered food to the guards at the Trnopolje prison camp. he said he never saw Tadic at the camp or heard that Tadic was a guard there.</P>

<P>On cross examination, prosecutor Grant Nieman tried to discredit the witness by suggesting he too took part in ethnic cleansing. Neiman questioned Karanovic about violently evicting a Muslim woman and her child from an apartment and then taking over her apartment. The witness denied that the takeover was violent. But the line of questioning once again brought to the fore the horrors of ethnic cleansing: </P>

<P>Neiman suggested Karanovic, armed with a knife and a machine gun, burst into the apartment where the woman was alone with her ten-year-old daughter. According to Neiman's version, Karanovic held a machine gun to the 10-year-old girl's head and told them to get out. Then he put the gun to the mother's head and said if they didn't get out they'd be killed. Karanovic denied the incident.</P>

<P>The second witness, <B>Slavica Lukic</B>, a Serb from Prijedor, said she lived just a few meters from the checkpoint where Tadic is said to have been working. She said she saw Tadic there frequently in June 1992. She said he helped her travel from work and back by waving down cars at the checkpoint and telling them to give her a ride. She also said that during his shifts, Tadic frequently walked to her house for a cup of coffee and a little chat. She said he never talked about politics, never expressed extreme nationalist views and never said he hated Muslims. </P>

<P>The third witness, <B>Nada Vacina</B>, a Serb, said she often saw Tadic at the checkpoint during the second half of June 1992. She and her mother-in-law traveled to the village once a week to get water and supplies. She said if Tadic was at the end of his shift, he'd give here a ride in his police car. </P>

<P>On cross-examination, Prosecutor Alan Tieger quizzed Vacina about Serbs taking over Muslim apartments. She said she didn't know much about the thousands of Muslims from Prijedor who ended up in the prison camps. She insisted she had many Muslim and Croat friends who never went to any camps and who are alive and well to this day. Tieger also questioned her about Tadic's apartment and whether she knew it had been owned by a Muslim, taken over by Serbs, and given to Tadic.</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Nikola Petrovic, a Serb police officer from Banja Luka, corroborated what previous defense witnesses have said -- that Tadic moved to Banja Luka at the time his hometown Kozarac was being attacked by Serbs. Prosecutors say Tadic participated in that attack. But several defense witnesses so far have said Tadic moved to Banja Luka after the attack started. Petrovic said he never heard Tadic express extreme nationalist views or any hatred of Muslims. When Petrovic said he saw a newspaper and read a headline: "Dusko Tadic War Criminal," he laughed because "it was incredible. This was just a big lie." 

	<LI>Borka Rakic, a Serb lawyer whose sister is married to Tadic's brother, also said Tadic moved to Banja Luka during the attack on Kozarac. She identified a picture of a house, which another defense witness identified as Tadic's house in Banja Luka. Rakic agred that she never heard Tadic express extreme nationalist views or hatred of Muslims.  On cross examination, prosecutor Grant Neiman suggested Rakic learned how to testify by watching other defense witnesses on television  in Bosnia. Rakic, however, denied that claim, saying she only watches this trial once in a while.</UL>

<B><P>October 4<BR></B>
Defense attorneys continued to produce alibi witnesses who claim they knew Dusko Tadic and worked with him in the second half of 1992.</P>

<P>Four witnesses took the stand:</P>

<P><B>Tomislav Dasic</B>, a Serb agricultural engineer, said that he, Tadic, and a female surveyor were part of a commission charged with inspecting abandoned houses in the Kozarac area to determine which could be used to house incoming Serb refugees.  Between Oct 1 and Dec. 15 of 1992, they  worked at least three or four days a week, usually for six or seven hours a day, he said. </P>

<P>Dasic claimed that he never heard Tadic express any extreme nationalist views, even though he admitted that he felt Tadic would be entitled to such views, due to the "turbulent times."  </P>

<P><B>Nada Vlacina</B>, a Serb woman who lives in Prijedor and originally testified Thursday, was briefly recalled by prosecutor Alan Tieger for additional recross.</P>

<P>She was asked about her husband and his involvement with the Serbian army.  Vlacina said that her husband suffered from health problems, and was not
mobilized until April 94.</P>

<P><B>Witness Y</B>, a Serb mechanical engineer, told the court that he and his family had been forced to flee from their predominantly Muslim region in Bosnia in  June 1992, after his father's house was burned down.  The approximately seventy Serb families from his village made their way to the Prijedor region, arriving on August 2, 1992.  Eventually, they were assigned vacant homes in the Kozarac area.</P>

<P>Y said he first met Dusko Tadic in mid August of 1992, when he acted as a representative for the new settlers at the local commune.  He denied that either Tadic or other party officials ever tried to force any specific political thoughts on others.  He said that Tadic was elected secretary of the
commune because he was one of the few local Serbs, and he knew everybody from before the conflict.  Y claimed Tadic was only interested in bringing life back to Kozarac.</P>

<P>Y said he saw Tadic in Kozarac at the police station almost every day during this period, when both men worked as reserve policemen.  He said he is sure that Tadic never spent time at Trnopolje camp because that area was not in their jurisdiction. He also said that Tadic appeared to him to be "very normal."</P>

<P>Prosecutor Alan Tieger requested that he be allowed to postpone cross-examination of this witness until Tuesday, to give the prosecution some additional time to prepare. The judges decided to grant the request.</P>

<P><B>Dusan Vajagic</B>, a Serb refugee who now lives in Kozarac, Vajagic is a car mechanic and professional fireman.  He, like Witness Y, described how he, his family, and other Serbs were driven out of their homes in late July of 1992.  On Aug. 2, he was part of a group of some 100 families who arrived in the Kozarac area, where he was assigned an abandoned house.</P>

<P>Vajagic met the defendant at the end of August or the beginning of September in 1992, when he joined the Kozarac reserve police force.  He later joined the local SDS party, serving as secretary (Tadic was president).  Vajagic said he saw Tadic frequently at party meetings, and that Tadic was primarily concerned with rebuilding Kozarac and organizing life there.  He denied that Tadic was involved with the Trnopolje camp, and described the defendant as a "family man, willing and eager to help people, a good man, never involved in conflict or clashes."</P>

<P>The last twenty-five minutes of this witness's direct testimony was in closed session.</P>

<P>On cross-examination, Vajagic told prosecutor Grant Niemann that he had no knowledge of the Muslims who had once lived in the Kozarac area, but admitted that he knew Serbs were originally in the minority there.  He also admitted that Tadic was "an important man" in the area, and that the defendant organized local political meetings.  </P>

<P>Cross examination of this witness will continue on Tuesday, in a closed session.</P>

Developments in the war crimes trial of Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic from Oct. 7-11 1996.<p>


<HR WIDTH=525 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>October 7</b><BR>
No session.</p>

<P><B>October 8</B><BR>
For weeks during the prosecution's case, tribunal judges heard testimony from witnesses who were relatives of Dusko Tadic's alleged victims. Today, for the first time, the court heard from one of the defendant's relatives.</P>

<P>The 35-year-old Serb wife of the defendant, <B>Mira Tadic</B> took the stand and told the court that that she and her husband had many friends who were Muslims and Croats. She said relations between the various ethnic groups in Kozarac prior to the 1992 conflict were good.</P>

<P>The couple met in 1976 in Kozarac, moved in together in 1979, and married in 1980.  She now lives in Prijedor with the couple's two daughters.</P>

<P>She described the various jobs the defendant has had over the years. When she got a nursing job in Libya in 1986, her husband followed her there. </P>

<P>Though they have a happy union, Tadic said she and her husband are no longer legally married. They obtained a  "divorce of convenience" in 1987 because she was trying to get a nursing position in Switzerland. They felt she would have a better shot at the job if she were single, she said.  </P>

<P>The divorce papers were filed, and even though she didn't ultimately get the nursing job, she and the defendant never bothered to get remarried.  Nevertheless, "we've always been together," she said. Their youngest daughter was born two years after their marriage was legally terminated.</P>

<P>Preceding Tadic, <B>witness "D,"</B> a Serb woman, took the stand and said she grew up with Dusko Tadic and for some four years Dusko and Mira Tadic lived in a house in Kozarac that she owned. She saw them in Kozarac several times a week before the conflict started and later in Prijedor, where she now lives.</P>

<P>D was an alternate member of the commission that inspected abandoned houses in the Kozarac region to determine their suitability for habitability. She claimed that this commission, of which the defendant was also a member, was only engaged in inspecting these former homes, and had no say in allocating them.  She also claimed that Tadic was a good man who expressed sadness about the ethnic tensions that came to a boil in the former Yugoslavia.</P>

<P>Her cross-examination was conducted in a closed session.</P>

<P>Other highlights:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Under cross-examination, Witness "Y," a Serb refugee who underwent direct examination last Friday, claimed to know little of the workings of the SDS party, even though he was a member of the local Kozarac SDS board. He did, however, admit that the Kozarac board was answerable to the main SDS board in Prijedor, and that Kozarac SDS board president Dusko Tadic was the one who coordinated with the higher authorities.

	<LI>Y strongly denied that reserve policemen or Serb refugees were involved in looting abandoned Muslim homes in the area, even when confronted with a work report written by the defendant that seemed to indicate that such looting had taken place.  

	<LI>Y also denied that he or fellow policemen ever went searching for Muslims who might be hiding in the hills around Kozarac or took Muslims out of the Trnopolje detention camp to force them to surrender hidden stashes of money or valuables 

	<LI>Like other defense witnesses, Y stressed that Trnopolje wasn't a detention camp, but merely a 'reception center'.</UL>

<P><B>October 9</B><BR>
Mira Tadic spent the entire day on the witness stand, defending her husband, accused war criminal Dusko Tadic.</P>

<P>In her second day of testimony, Tadic continued to claim that relations between the various Kozarac ethnic groups were very good in the years prior to 1992.  She named Muslim Emir Karabasic, one of the men whom Tadic is charged with torturing and murdering, as a particular close friend of Dusko Tadic. But she admitted that the relationship began to cool in 1991. </P>

<P>In 1991, she and her husband joined the SDS and helped organize a plebiscite for Serbs on whether or not Bosnia-Herzegovina should remain a part of Yugoslavia.  But she denied that either of them studied SDS literature or theology. She blamed worsening tensions in the Kozarac area on the fact that Muslims and Croats wanted their own state, and said that everyone seemed to become very politicized.</P>

<P>She claimed there were rumors that Dusko Tadic refused to serve non-Serbs in his coffee bar, which led to a boycott and some broken windows.  The Tadic family left Kozarac on May 3, 1992, feeling that it wasn't safe for them anymore.</P>

<P>Mira Tadic said Dusko Tadic moved to Prijedor on June 15, 1992, and she, their daughters, and Dusko's mother followed on June 27.  At this time, her husband began to work for the traffic police in Prijedor; in August, he began to work out of the police station in Kozarac.  </P>

<P>She said her husband didn't spend any time away from his family during this period, except for the nights he spent in Kozarac while on a police call.  His political activities during these months were solely for the purpose of reviving the devastated town.</P>

<P>The witness moved to Munich in 1993, where she found work as a nurse. The defendant followed her and was arrested there in February of 1994.</P>

<P>Prosecutor Michael Keegan began his cross examination by reading the witness a copy of a letter allegedly written to her by her husband while he was in a German prison.  It seems to suggest that Tadic was asking his wife to provide him with an alibi.</P>

<P>"Remember we spent every night together in Prijedor," he allegedly wrote, "I hope you can testify."</P>

<P>Mira Tadic, however, said she'd never received this letter, although she admitted it was in her husband's handwriting.  Defense lawyers also claimed they had never seen the letter, though prosecutors insisted they should have had a copy of it. </P>

<P>After much wrangling, the tribunal ruled that the introduction of the document was appropriate for impeachment purposes. But this witness couldn't be asked further questions about it, since she claimed she'd never seen it.</P>

<P><B>October 10</B><BR>
Witness "Z" and witness "A", whose identities are being protected by the tribunal, testified in a closed session.</P>

<P>A's direct examination was scheduled to continue the following day.</P>

<P><B>October 11</B><BR>
Witness "A" and witness "B" testified for the defense in a closed session. The identity of these witnesses is being withheld by the tribunal.</P>

Developments in the war crimes trial of Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic from Oct. 14-18 1996.<p>
<P><B>October 14</B><BR>
The defense plans to present the testimony of several witnesses via a video link to Banja Luka, Bosnia, beginning Oct. 15.</P>

<P>Defense attorney Michail Wladimiroff and prosecutor Michael Keegan traveled to Bosnia over the weekend to oversee the link.</P>

<P>Court officials say most of the witnesses who will testify via video will be heard in open court, and most of them will do so without having their images on the TV screen distorted.</P>
<P><B>October 15</B><BR>
On the first day the video link to the Bosnian town of Banja Luka was up and running, two defense witnesses testified that Dusko Tadic was a member of the Prijedor region's traffic police and worked at a traffic checkpoint nearly every day in June and July of 1992, a time when the prosecution claims Tadic was committing war crimes at prison camps in northern Bosnia.</P>

<P><B>Zeljko Maric</B>, a Serb from Prijedor, said he has been a traffic policeman since 1980 and worked with Tadic  at a checkpoint on the Prijedor/Banja Luka road, between Prijedor and Kozarac, in June and July of 1992.  </P>

<P>He and Tadic were usually on different shifts at the checkpoint. But occasionally they worked together, and they saw each other there almost every day, he said. Tadic and the other traffic policemen at the checkpoint carried pistols and automatic rifles. At  first they wore regular police uniforms. Later they wore camouflage, he said.</P>

<P>This witness also said that he and the defendant had a common friend in Emir Karabasic, whom Tadic is charged with killing in Omarska. Maric testified that he had known Karabasic since they had attended the police academy in Sarajevo together, and that Tadic and Karabasic were close friends.</P>

<P>As other witnesses have said, Maric claimed that Tadic never express any nationalistic sentiments during conversations they had. </P>

<P>On prosecutor Grant Niemann's cross-examination, Maric testified that Tadic never expressed any interest in politics, insisting that what the defendant really loved was sports.  He claimed not to be aware of the fact that Tadic had been one of the first members of the Prijedor SDS, that he had organized an SDS-sponsored plebiscite prior to the conflict, or that he had held a political party position in Kozarac starting in the fall of 1992.</P>

<P>The SDS -- or Serbian Democratic Party -- was formed in 1990 by Radovan Karadzic, the former Serb leader who is indicted by the tribunal for genocide and other war crimes.</P>

<P>Maric also admitted on cross-examination that after April 1992, the Prijedor police department was under the control of the municipality's Serb-run authorities and that the police would have been obligated to follow the orders of this administration.  He denied, however, that these authorities were carrying out a policy of ethnic cleansing of Muslims. If police were involved in carrying out the murders and tortures of inmates in the area's detention camps, he was not aware of it.</P>

<P><B>Duro Prpos</B>, a Serb and the commander of the Prijedor traffic police in April 1992, testified that he first met Dusko Tadic in June 1992, when Tadic was mobilized as a reserve policeman.  He identified redacted traffic police department records -- such as log books and payroll documents -- that seemed to confirm that the defendant had worked at the traffic checkpoint between June 16 and August 2 in 1992. Prpos admitted he did not personally fill out these records. But he insisted that they were filled out under his supervision and were "100% accurate."  He also said he never received any complaints about Tadic missing duty or being absent from his post.</P>

<P>On cross examination by prosecutor Brenda Hollis, Maric admitted that he had originally been deputy commander of the traffic police under a Muslim commander, and was promoted after the April 1992 Serb takeover of Prijedor. </P>

<P>He also testified that Muslims who left the force following the April takeover did so because they refused to sign a "solemn declaration to accept and enforce the laws of the Republika Srpska," something he called an "usual kind of declaration."  He did, however, admit that all reserve policemen who were mobilized into the force after the takeover did sign the declaration (which would include Dusko Tadic).</P>

<P>The cross-examination of this witness will continue Wednesday.</P>

<P><B>October 16</B><BR>
Five witnesses testifying via video link from the Bosnian town of Banja Luka claimed that defendant Dusko Tadic was elsewhere at the time prosecutors charge he was rounding up, torturing, and killing Muslims in northern Bosnia.  </P>

<P>Under cross-examination, <B>Duro Prpos</B>, the former commander of the Prijedor region's traffic police, was questioned about documents that he said showed Tadic was working at a traffic checkpoint in 1992. He admitted that the documents were not kept in his personal custody but insisted that they were accurate. </P>

<P>Prpos gave several answers that may have cost him some credibility with the Tribunal judges.  He repeatedly denied knowing of Serb plans to take over Prijedor in April of 1992 until the night it happened, even though he was a deputy police commander at the time.  </P>

<P>He maintained that no policemen in the Prijedor region had taken part in any rounding up of non-Serbs and insisted that the thousands of Muslims who were expelled from the area left voluntarily. He also claimed to have no knowledge of the busloads of non-Serbs being moved around the region.  </P>

<P>Other highlights:</P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>

	<LI><B>Mirko Vujanovic</B>, a Prijedor policeman in charge of records, identified documents that show Dusko Tadic worked virtually every day between August 7 and September 9, 1992 as a reserve policeman in the town of Prijedor. On cross-examination, he admitted that he maintained the records based on documents supplied to him by other police supervisors and didn't have personal knowledge that the defendant actually worked on the days and times reflected.

	<LI>Dragoljub Savic, an economist with the Bosnian railroad, introduced timetables showing there was regularly scheduled train service that operated between the towns of Prijedor and Banja Luka on the dates May 23 and June 15, 1992, dates on which others have testified that Dusko Tadic traveled that route by rail.

	<LI>Trivo Reljic, a retired Serb medical technician who lived across the street from the Tadic family in Prijedor, said his family took Tadic in their car when they left Kozarac on the morning of May 23, 1992, the day before the city was attacked.  According to Reljic, they dropped Tadic off in Prijedor later that day.

	<LI>Stojan Smoljic, a Serb refugee who settled with his family in the town of Kozarac in October of 1992, said  Tadic was the secretary of the local commune and helped him find a home. Smoljic said he saw Tadic in town nearly every day throughout the rest of 1992. Smoljic said Dusko Tadic was in charge of distributing humanitarian aid to the refugees  and did so regardless of a person's ethnic origin.
</UL>

<P><B>October 17</B><BR>
During the third day of video link from Banja Luka, the defense continued to call witness to account for the whereabouts of Dusko Tadic in the time period after May 1992.  Technological problems with the video link shortened the court session.</P>

<P>Highlights:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Stojan Smoljic, a Serb refugee who settled with his family in the town of Kozarac in October of 1992, took the stand for continued his cross-examination.  He said that he knew that Dusko Tadic was involved in the local SDS in Prijedor, but claimed that he knew nothing of SDS business.  He repeatedly described Tadic as a man who treated both Serbs and non-Serbs fairly and hated war. All the Kozarac townspeople were shocked when they learned that the defendant had been arrested for war crimes, he said.

	<LI>Jelena Gajic, a nurse at the Prijedor hospital and the defendant's sister-in-law.  She testified that the defendant came to her home in Prijedor on the morning of Saturday, May 23, 1992, the day before Kozarac was attacked, and left to rejoin his family in Banja Luka. This story is consistent with the testimony from Trivo Reljic, who testified a day earlier that his family drove Tadic to Prijedor that morning.  Gajic also said she knew Tadic worked as a reserve policeman that summer and saw him in Kozarac when he was secretary of the local commune there.

	<LI>Duro Prpos, the former commander of the traffic police in Prijedor, returned briefly to the stand to identify some copies of pages from the department's daily work schedule in 1992.  When he originally testified October 15 and 16, this witness identified redacted copies of these documents, with all entries other than those relating to the defendant removed.  The court has since been able to obtain unredacted copies of some of these records and the defendant took the stand to identify them.
</UL>
<P><B>October 18</B><BR>
The video link phase of the defense case came to an end.  In all, the defense used the satellite link between The Hague and Banja Luka to call eight witnesses over four days.  Next week, alibi testimony on behalf of defendant Dusko Tadic will resume in The Netherlands.</P>

<P><B>Mirko Vujanovic</B>, a Prijedor policeman in charge of records, who originally testified on October 16 to identified documents that indicate Tadic worked virtually every day between August 7 and September 9, 1992 as a reserve policeman in the town of Prijedor, returned to the stand for continued cross-examination.</P>

<P>In his testimony on Wednesday, Vujanovic referred to documents which had been highly redacted.  Prosecutors confronted Vujanovic with apparent discrepancies between the redacted and unredated versions. </P>

<P>The redacted schedule of the Prijedor police for August 21, 1992 shows that Tadic worked a shift between the hours of 14:00 and 21:00.  But the unredacted version reflects that the defendant worked a shift from 6:00 to 14:00.</P>

<P>Certainly, prosecutors would like the judges to infer that these records, which the defense is counting on to bolster Tadic's alibi, are best unreliable.  </P>

<P>But Vujanovic suggested something much less sinister.  He claims the discrepancy is most likely just a typing error, and that the date recorded on the work list should actually be August 12, not August 21.  The daily schedule seems to show that the shift hours Tadic was set to work on August 12 match the ones set down in the disputed August 21 entry.</P>

Developments in the war crimes trial of Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic from Oct.
21-25 1996.<p>
<P><B>October 21</B><BR>
The Tribunal was not in session.</P>

<P><B>October 22</B><BR>
The trial shifted back to The Netherlands after a week of testimony via a satellite video link from the Bosnian town of Banja Luka. The defense continued to presented alibi witnesses to convince the court that Dusko Tadic couldn't have committed the war crimes with which he's charged.  </P>

<P>Highlights:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><B>Joso Popovic</B>, a Serb refugee who was the vice-president of the local SDS board at the same time that Tadic was president, denied that Tadic was the commander of the Trnopolje detention camp He also denied that either he or Tadic were involved in planning for the cleansing of non-Serbs from the Kozarac region. But he admitted that Sasha, the elder of the witness' two sons, worked at the camp as part of his mobilization by the Bosnian Serb army. A brief part of Popovic's testimony was heard in closed session.

	<LI><B>Sinisa Popovic</B>, the 22-year-old son of the previous witness, supported his father's testimony. And like his father, he was also questioned briefly in closed session.

	<LI><B>Drago Jankovic</B>, the defendant's  cousin, testified that his army unit was assigned "to help Serb and Muslim civilians who were in danger."  He repeated that Tadic worked as a traffic policeman at the Orlavci checkpoint the summer of 1992. 

	<LI>On cross-examination, Jankovic said some things that were perhaps a little hard for the judges to swallow.  For one thing, he maintained that the shelling of Kozarac -- which other witnesses have maintained took place over three to four days -- lasted no more than three-quarters of a single day, and even then consisted only of brief periods of actual shelling. Jankovic claimed that he and the other Serb soldiers were only there to help Serbs and non-Serbs alike escape injury. When asked about the Keraterm, Omarska, and Trnopolje detention camps, Jankovic said that he only knew that civilians were bussed to Prijedor, and had no idea what happened to them after that.

	<LI><B>Ljubomir Tadic</B>, one of Tadic's three older brothers, began his testimony at the end of the day, giving details of his family's life in Kozarac.
</UL>
<P><B>October 23</B><BR>
Ljubo Tadic denied that his brother, the defendant, had any part in the ethnic cleansing of non-Serbs from the Kozarac area in 1992 and gave a detailed account of much of the defendant's whereabouts during that year.</P>

<P>But on cross examination, the witness had to admit that he wasn't with his brother all the time and he was forced to deny that he practiced pro-Serb nationalism himself.</P>

<P>According to Tadic, his brother never showed much interest in politics, even though in 1991 he joined the SDS, the political party lead by Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb political leader charged by the tribunal with genocide and other war crimes. </P>

<P>Echoing other witnesses, Tadic said his family got along well with its mostly-Muslim neighbors, though he did admit that the political climate chilled a bit in 1991, especially after his brother allegedly received a threatening letter from the "young Muslims of Kozarac," promising the start of  "a Holy Jihad," or holy war.  </P>

<P>Nonetheless, Tadic said his brother remained in Kozarac until the day before the town was shelled.  He regularly visited the city because he opened a wholesale beverage distributorship in part of the family home, the same building where his brother's cafe was located</P>

<P>Tadic was in Banja Luka when the shelling began, and said his brother's family was reunited there on May 23, 1992.  He said he and his brother returned to Kozarac twice in the coming weeks, once about June 1 or 2, and again three or four days later.  On the first occasion, they found evidence of damage from the shelling, but most of their possessions remained intact.  By the second trip, however, their premises had been looted. Ljubo had lost over three hundred crates of beer and Dusko lost most of the possessions from his coffee bar.  
</P> 
<P>Ljubo Tadic backed up the defendant's account of his whereabouts after the shelling of Kozarac in May 1992.  He said his brother joined the traffic police in Prijedor on June 16, and eventually ended up working with newly arrived refugees back in Kozarac.  The witness himself was also mobilized on June 16, and spent the next years in and out of Banja Luka.</P>

<P>On cross examination, Ljubo Tadic admitted that some of what he knows about his brother's comings and going during the summer of 1992 are from what others told him, although he insisted that he had seen his brother regularly in Banja Luka, Prijedor, and Kozarac.  </P>

<P>This witness was also put on the defensive about statements he might have made in the past about Muslims starting a "jihad" against Christians and that any Muslim massacres were just retaliation for Serb massacres during World War II.  Ljubo Tadic didn't admit making those statements, but he didn't completely disassociate himself from them, either.</P>

<P>Finally, Ljubo Tadic vigorously denied that either he or his brother had helped to plan and prepare for the Serb attack on Kozarac.</P>

<P><B>October 24</B><BR>
The defense shifted gears today, as his attorneys moved from alibi testimony to an expert witness.  </P>

<P>Three witnesses testified. The first two -- Pero Opacic and Janko Opacic -- were called in a closed session in the morning.</P>

<P>The third, Willem Wagenaar, a professor of psychology at the University of Leiden (a Dutch city  near The Hague),  is considered one of the leading experts in the field of identification and was originally contacted by the prosecution. Because of the questions he raised, prosecutors decided not to use him.</P>

<P>Wagenaar has testified many times in the past in both Dutch and international cases, including the "Ivan the Terrible" case in Israel, in which a Polish-born U.S. retired autoworker was accused of being an infamous World War II concentration camp guard.</P>

<P>Though the prosecution presented some 52 witnesses who identified Dusko Tadic in the courtroom or through a photographic line-up, Wagenaar said that most of those witnesses cannot be relied upon because they had known the defendant previously. He said research has shown that it is common for witnesses who have known a suspect before a crime to confuse him with someone whom they subsequently see commit that crime.</P>

<P>Four witnesses identified Tadic through a photo line-up and they didn't know him before the conflict. Wagenaar acknowledged that those identifications were significant but still problematic. He said they could have received subliminal clues by investigators or the media. </P>

<P>Much of Professor Wagenaar's testimony consisted of the witness and defense attorney Michail Wladimiroff going over some 50 "rules" investigators should follow in order to correctly administer a photo line-up identification test. These rules are from a textbook written by this witness.  Among the rules:  Investigators who administer the line-up shouldn't know which photo represents the accused.  Witnesses should have to make an identification quickly and not be given a lot of time to think about it.  Witnesses should be told  that it's possible there is no photo of the accused in the line-up.  And witnesses who've been given this test should not be allowed to interact with other witnesses who have yet to take it.</P>

<P>By these standards, the identification methods used against Tadic are lacking, Wagenaar said.</P>

<P>Prosecutor Alan Tieger begin his cross-examination in the final half hour of the day, and most of that time was spent clarifying the witness' prior relationship with prosecutors, apparently to eliminate any implication of prosecution wrong-doing. </P>

<P><B>October 25</B><BR>
Moments before defendant Dusko Tadic took the stand in his own defense, the prosecution was forced to admit to the court that the evidence of one of their most powerful witnesses against the defendant could no longer be relied upon.</P>

<P>Shortly before lunch, the court went into a closed session. After the midday break, prosecutor Grant Niemann made the stunning announcement that as a result of an on-going investigation prosecutors had concluded that prosecution witness "L" -- who originally testified in August, and  was recalled in September --had lied on the stand.  </P>

<P>The witness admitted he was lying when he said that he saw Bosnian Serb defendant Dusko Tadic committing atrocities at a camp in northwest Bosnia in 1992. </P>

<P>"As a consequence, the prosecution feels we can no longer support him as a witness of truth," said Niemann.  "We invite the chamber to disregard his testimony entirely, and in relation to those matters the defendant has no case to answer."</P>

<P>Niemann called tribunal investigator Robert Reid to explain what had happened.  Reid, the head investigator in the Tadic case, told the court that he had arranged a meeting that morning between witness "L" and Pero Opacic and Janko Opacic -- two defense witnesses #35 and 36 who testified in closed session Thursday morning.  </P>

<P>At first, according to Reid, witness "L" insisted that he did not know either Opacic.  But after leaving them alone together for some 25 minutes, Reid testified that "L" confessed that Pero was his brother and Janko was his father.</P>

<P>According to Reid, witness "L"/Drago Opacic apologized for lying, and claimed he'd been "set up by the Bosnians."  He said that he had been captured by the army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1994 and was beaten by military interrogators who then ordered him to lie about having been in the Trnopolje detention camp.  He claimed he was shown video footage of Tadic and the camp, and was interrogated for seven hours per day for a month, until he signed a statement saying he'd been a guard there.  He told Reid that if he hadn't signed this false confession, he would have been executed.</P>

<P>Opacic testified in August that he was a guard at Trnopolje camp and took part in gang rapes and summary executions of prisoners along with Tadic. His testimony, among the most compelling of the 75 prosecution witnesses, included details of Tadic shooting elderly men at point-blank range and raping young girls. </P>

<P>Reid offered no explanation as to why Bosnian authorities would do what Opacic said they did. </P>

<P>Prosecutors immediately withdrew charges against Tadic relating to alleged atrocities at Trnopolje. Tadic still faces a string of murder and torture charges relating to alleged atrocities in and around two other camps in the region. </P>

<P>The three-judge tribunal panel has the power to impose a maximum $10,000 fine and or one-year imprisonment on Opacic for perjury. </P>

<P>Tadic's Testimony: Under direct examination by Steven Kay, the defendant spent the afternoon going through his life prior to the fall of Kozarac in 1992.  He said that most of his friends as a child had been Muslims or Croats and that he never thought anything about this because that was the way his father had raised him.  </P>

<P>The defendant appeared to be relaxed as he spoke.  The two tribunal security guards who have been sitting on either side of the defendant throughout the trial have followed him to the witness stand. </P>

<P>Tadic denied that he was the karate champion that others him as described, claiming that he seldom took part in competitions and that his brothers achieved a higher level of proficiency than he did.  Numerous prosecution witnesses have testified that local papers frequently mentioned Tadic's Karate prowess.</P>

<P>Describing pre-war Kozarac, Tadic recalled that people of every ethnic nationality lived together peacefully.  His coffee bar was very popular among non-Serbs, especially young Muslims, and never would have survived if it only welcomed Serbs.</P>

<P>Dusko Tadic recalled his friendship with Emir Karabasic, whom he is charged with murdering.  He said he and Karabasic were as close as brothers and often vacationed together.  Other witnesses have said that this relationship appeared to cool in late 1991 and early 1992. Tadic denied this, claiming the two men simply could not see each other as often because Karabasic was having problems at work.  </P>

<P>But Tadic acknowledged a change in Kozarac as the conflict drew closer.  He described the threatening letter he allegedly received in 1990 from "young Muslims of Kozarac," and said he has no idea who sent it. </P>

<P>He downplayed his membership in the SDS, the political party led by Radovan Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb leader charged by the tribunal with genocide and other war crimes, saying he never read party literature or even knew if the party had a statute.  It would have been impossible for him to be active in the party, he said, because there was no local chapter in Kozarac at that time, and party rules would have limited involvement in the Prijedor chapter to those living in Prijedor itself.  He said that he had believed at this time that all of the major political parties (the SDS, SDA, and HDZ) were working together to eradicate the remnants of Communism in Yugoslavia, not plotting any kind of ethnic division.</P>

<P>By April of 1992, however, Tadic said that it was apparent something was happening.  He said that people -- particularly young people -- began to carry weapons on the street, often quite openly.  And he said those in Kozarac who had friends or relatives elsewhere were leaving town, Serb and non-Serb alike -- which is why he sent his wife and their two daughters to stay with a friend.</P>

<P>Before defense attorney Kay could get to the actual fall of Kozarac, however, court was adjourned for the day.  Tadic will pick up at that point as his direct testimony continues on Monday morning.</P>

<P>In the morning, defense expert witness Willem Wagenaar concluded his testimony. Once again, in a very even-handed manner, he stressed that the claims of dozens of prosecution witnesses that they had seen Dusko Tadic either committing war crimes or at the crime scenes could not necessarily be trusted.  He repeated that the only valuable identifications in this case are the four made by persons who didn't know Tadic prior to the conflict, but also repeated that there may have been irregularities with the testing procedures used to obtain those positive identifications that could render them meaningless.</P>

Developments in the war crimes trial of Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic from Oct.
28-30 1996.<p>
<P><B>October 28</B><BR>
Under questioning by defense attorney Steven Kay, Dusko Tadic's continued to tell his version of the events leading up to and following the fall of Kozarac in 1992. Once again, Tadic stated that the town changed in the spring of that year, particularly after the SDS takeover of Prijedor on April 29.</P>

<P>The SDS is the Bosnian Serb political party led by Radovan Karadzic, who is accused by the tribunal of genocide and other war crimes.</P>

<P>At the end of the day, Tadic was still undergoing direct examination. On Tuesday he is expected to face prosecutor Alan Tieger's cross-examination.</P>

<P>Tadic, who was so calm when he took stand on Friday, seemed a little more excited today. Several times, Kay had to tell him to slow down because the translators couldn't keep up with him. Sometimes he wanted to give more information than was warranted by a question, forcing Kay to guide him back to the issue at hand.</P>

<P>One could see people with weapons everywhere in Kozarac in 1992, Tadic said, describing a sense of desperation settling over the area as people grew to question whom they could trust. But he chose to remain in town, operating his coffee bar, even though his wife, daughters, and mother left.</P>

<P>Tadic said he was asked to join a delegation of Kozarac citizens who went to Prijedor to negotiate with the new Serb authorities. In Prijedor, Tadic met Simon Drljaca, the new Serb police chief, who issued an ultimatum that all policemen had to sign a loyalty pledge and wear a Serb insignia on their uniforms. Those who chose to resign were ordered to turn in their weapons.</P>

<P>Tadic claimed that several Muslim policemen in Kozarac were willing to sign the pledge. But threats of "liquidation" by others in town dissuaded them. By May 23, he said the time had come for him to get out of Kozarac. He got a ride with a neighbor to Prijedor, where he took a train to Banja Luka and rejoined his family.</P>

<P>Tadic's version of two return trips to Kozarac in early June matched those of his brother, Ljubomir, who testified a few weeks ago. He said he and his brother returned the first time to find most of their belongings intact. But when they came back with a truck, most of what they owned had been looted. Tadic denied having any role in the ethnic cleansing of the town, claiming that virtually no one was there by the time he and Ljubo arrived.</P>

<P>The defendant's account of his being mobilized into the Prijedor reserve traffic police also matches the testimony of others. He said he started his new job on June 16, at which time he was assigned to the Orlavci checkpoint. Tadic insisted that he never missed work when he was stationed there. Following his reassignment to guard the bus and railway station in Prijedor, Tadic was finally transferred to the Kozarac police in September of 1992.</P>

<P>Tadic testified in detail about his election as secretary of the local Kozarac commune and his assumption of the presidency of the Kozarac SDS. He downplayed both moves, saying his only goal was to save the town after authorities called for it to be razed. </P>

<P>Asked if he had ever been to Omarska, Keraterm, or Trnopolje, the prison camps where prosecutors say he brutalized and killed inmates, Tadic said, "No," except for one visit to Trnopolje with defense witness Jovo Samardija, to help him locate his sister.</P>

<P><B>October 29</B><BR>
Defendant Dusko Tadic completed his testimony after undergoing several hours of cross-examination as prosecutors tried to deliver a knock-out punch.</P>

<P>Prosecutor Alan Tieger began by asking Tadic about his involvement in the expulsion of Muslims from Kozarac. Tadic denied knowing anything about it. </P>

<P>Rather than being contentious, Tieger spent much of the time contrasting Tadic's direct examination with what Tadic told German authorities and tribunal investigators. Tieger pointed out several discrepancies, particularly the dates relating to the period when Tadic was first mobilized into the Prijedor reserve traffic police. </P>

<P>The defendant never denied that he'd given conflicting accounts. Every time he was asked if he'd given a particular statement in the past, he said it was possible. He stressed that the story he has told is true but admitted that he has always been unsure of exact dates. When he first spoke to German authorities, he said he assumed that he didn't need to be precise because he supposed that work records from this period would back him up.</P>

<P>Other questions arose:</P>

<P><B>The Rifle:</B> Much was made of a certificate allowing Tadic to have possession of a semi-automatic rifle. It is dated from the beginning of May 1992 -- before the fall of Kozarac -- and it indicates that the weapon was issued to Tadic as a member of the territorial defense. According to the defendant, he was given the gun by a deserter from the war in Slovenia. He obtained a blank certificate from his brother and filled it out himself. But in an earlier interview, the defendant seemed to indicate that he had received the certificate from someone in Prijedor. Tadic's explanation: he actually had two fake certificates and was confused as to which one the earlier investigators were asking him about.</P>

<P><B>The Uniforms:</B> Tadic has given varying estimates of how many uniforms he owned and which ones he wore. He testified that he wore a blue police uniform as a traffic police officer at the Orlavci checkpoint. But he conceded that he may have worn a camouflage uniform there -- but only when his regular uniform was being laundered. Some prosecution witnesses have placed Tadic in prison camps wearing camouflage. Tadic admitted he told German authorities months ago he never owned or wore a uniform.</P>

<P><B>The Work Report:</B> A lot of time was devoted to a letter or "work report" the defendant wrote in August of 1993, which was recovered from his home in Germany at the time of his arrest. Tieger referred again and again to portions of this document, which he claimed is, in part, an autobiographical account of the defendant's actions prior to the fall of Kozarac. According to the prosecution, Tadic does the following in the letter:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><P>He denounces Serbs who cooperated with Muslims or failed to vote in his plebiscite;</P>

	<LI><P>He claims he was active in the securing of weapons and other preparations before the takeover;</P>

	<LI><P>He professes himself to be committed to the Serb cause and the establishment of Republika Srpska. </P>
</UL>

<P>Tieger accused Tadic of intending to send this document to SDS authorities in Prijedor, including Radovan Karadzic.</P>

<P>Not surprisingly, Tadic's explanation is quite different. He claims most of what is contained in the letter is not his opinion. Instead, it is taken from reports he had access to as secretary of the local Kozarac commune. He implied that it was prepared to aid him in his struggle against the military's continuing efforts to mobilize him, even though he was supposedly exempt because of his work in Kozarac. </P>

<P>With that, Dusko Tadic's cross examination came to a close. </P>


<P><B>October 30</B><BR>
After twenty-six days and forty witnesses, the defense in the war crimes trial of Dusko Tadic ended its case- in-chief. The last two witnesses it called were used to undermine the credibility of previous prosecution witnesses.</P>

<P><B>Dragan Petrovic</B>, an investigator from Belgrade, identified photographs he took in Kozarak. The first set of photos he identified depicted the "triangle" -- sometimes referred to as the "square," even though it only has three sides -- in the center of Kozarac, down the main street from the Tadic family home. Several prosecution witnesses have described seeing the defendant in this area as Muslims were surrendering to Serbs following the shelling of the town. These photographs, however, seem to suggest that it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to see some of the things these witnesses have described.</P>

<P>Petrovic also identified some photos of light poles near the Serb Orthodox Church in Kozarac. He testified that the pole closest to the church does not have a working lamp. He said the priest at the church told him the light has been out since before the war. This evidence may be intended to refute the June 14 testimony of Nihad Seferovic, who claimed he was hiding across the street from the church when he saw Tadic slit the throats of two Muslim police officers. Seferovic testified that he hid in an plum orchard. Petrovic said he didn't see any orchard at that site.</P>

<P>The cross-examination of this witness was fairly brief, and mainly concerned the type of camera lenses used to take the photos in question and the possible effect the lenses might have on perceptions of distance or depth. </P>

<P>The final witness, <B>Thomas Deichmann</B>, a freelance German journalist, was called as an expert on German media. The defense hopes to persuade the tribunal that many of the witnesses who claimed they recognized Tadic as the man they saw in Serb-run prison camps actually remember him from seeing him on television or in newspapers and magazines. </P>

<P>According to Deichmann, the media in Germany covered the Tadic case extensively, particularly at the time of his arrest, his first hearing, and the beginning of his trial. In all, Deichmann said his research suggests that the major German television stations aired at least 59 reports mentioning Tadic between February 1994 and October 1996; a minimum of 27 of those pieces included video or photographs of the defendant. These totals don't include references to the case in documentaries or video magazine pieces. Deichmann played an excerpt from one such documentary, "War Criminals in Germany." </P>

<P>With that, the defense rested. The prosecution rebuttal is scheduled to begin Nov. 5.</P>

Developments in the war crimes trial of Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic from Nov. 4 - 8 1996.<p>
<P><B>November 6</B><BR>
The prosecution began its rebuttal case calling six witnesses -- three who have previously testified and three who are new.</P>

<P>All the witnesses offered testimony that cast unflattering light on defense witnesses.</P>

<P>The witnesses who previously testified:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><P>Sakib Sivac -- a survivor of the Keraterm prison camp who originally testified July 31. He was called to discredit defense witness "W," whom he said he saw at the camp wearing a uniform and armed. Sivac said he saw "W" curse at the Muslim inmates. "W" testified Sept. 18 and 19 in a closed session . Transcripts have not been released. </P>

	<LI><P>Jusuf Arifagic -- a Muslim from Kozarac who originally testified Aug. 8. Arifagic was also called to discredit "W." He recalled an incident when "W" threatened to explode a grenade in a bar against people whom he claim "framed" him.</P>

	<LI><P>Nasiha Klipic -- another Muslim from Kozarac who originally teistified June 13. She claimed she saw defense witness Zeljko Maric on May 27, 1992, when she and other Muslims surrendered. Maric was in uniform, armed and helping round up those surrendering, she said.</P>
</UL>

<P>All these witnesses were on the stand briefly and none was subjected to cross-examination.</P>

<P>The new witnesses:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><P>Advija Compara -- a Muslim, recounted a story of how defense witness Rajko Karanovic and two other men came to her appartment in July 1992 and told her to leave by the next morning. One of them -- apparently under Karanovic's direction -- held a gun to Compara temple. Karnovic had been asked about this incident in his cross-examination and he denied threatening Compara. At the trnopolje prison camp, Compara saw the defendant Dusko Tadic at least twenty times, sometimes in uniform, always armed and always inside the camp, including the main school building.</P>

	<LI><P>Muneverna Kulasic -- a Muslim woman who lived in Prijedor, described Tadic and another man at her sister's apartment on June 20, 1992, ordering her family to vacate the premises. Her furnishings and most of her posesions were seized. She later learned that Tadic's family moved in and saw Tadic's wife walking in Prijedor, wearing one of her jackets.</P>

	<LI><P>Fikret Kadiric -- a Muslim who was the Prijedor traffic police commander at the time of the Serb takeover. He was arrested in May 1992 and taken to police headquarters where he saw busloads of Muslims men being unloaded and heard sounds of beating and screams. He said defense witness Duro Prpos was present that day. Prpos denied knowing about this episode in his testimony.</P>
</UL>

<P>Kadiric begins his cross-examination when testimony resumes.</P>

<P><B>November 7</B><BR>
The prosecution called to the stand its final four rebuttal witnesses as the evidence phase in the war crimes trial of Dusko Tadic came to a close.</P>

<P>The defense declined to present anything further. The trial will be recess until Nov. 25 as both sides prepare for closing arguments.</P>

<P>Highlights from Nov. 7 testimony:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Fikret Kariric -- the former Prejedor traffic police commander returned for a five-minute cross-examination, answering questions about the Serb takeover of Prejedor.

	<LI>Witness "A A" -- the last of the witnesses to testify in a closed session.

	<LI>Sofia Tadic -- a Croat, said she was married to the defendant's brother Mladin Tadic from 1978 to 1991. She contradicted the defendant's testimony, saying that the defendant showed increasing interest in Serb nationalism in the late 1980s. She said that Tadic had planned to name his second child "Slobodan" after the Serb leader, if it was a boy. She also refuted Tadic's claim that he had a lot of Muslim friends in Kozarac. She described Tadic as "violent," and hot-tempered, recounting one incident when Tadic beat his wife and another incident when Tadic got into an argument with  a man, hit him in the head and grabbed his genitals. Later, the witness said, Tadic allegedly began to splash gasoline around the man's house, threatening to set a fire until a family member calmed him down.

	<LI>Robert Reid -- the tribunal's head investigator for the Tadic case, returned to the stand to assure the tribunal that four witnesses had properly identified Tadic. This testimony was used to counter defense witness Professor Williem Wagenaar, an expert in identification who questioned Reid's methods. Reid also described two interviews with Tadic, noting that Tadic was "very deliberate" in his answers, had full access to documents, and had an attorney with him at all times.

	<LI>Alfred Hubel -- a German policeman. After Tadic's arrest, Hubel interviewed him. Like the previous witness, Hubel said Tadic had an attorney at all times and access to all documents. The witness testified in Germany, through an interpreter with his image electrically distorted.

<H2>Rule 61 Hearing</H2>

<P>Staff Reports<br>
June 27, 1996</P>

<P>The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has started a so-called Rule 61 hearing against Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic. </P>

<P>Karadzic and Mladic were indicted on July 25, 1995, and warrants were issued for their arrests. They are charged with:

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Genocide, acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or part, a national, ethnic, or religious group.

	<LI>Crimes Against Humanity, which includes murder, rape, sexual assault and torture, committed in armed conflict as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population.

	<LI>Violations of the Laws or Customs of War, against persons who took no active part in the hostilities.

	<LI>Grave Breaches of the Geneva Convention of 1949, relative to the protection of civilians in time of war, including forcible sexual intercourse.
</UL>

<P>The indictments against the two were the result of a strategy that involved investigating lower-level individuals directly involved in carrying out the crimes in order to build effective cases against the military and civilian leaders who allegedly planned and organized the crimes. </P>

<P>The charges stem from the atrocities perpetrated against the civilian population throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina, for the sniping campaigns against civilians in Sarajevo, and for the taking of UN-peacekeepers as hostages and their use as human shields.</P>

<P>Despite the fact that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is charged with executing the arrest warrants, the two men have not yet been arrested. As a result, prosecutors are using the Rule 61 hearing to obtain "international" arrest warrants.</P>

<P><b>The Hearing</b><br>
A Rule 61 hearing is necessary when the accused voluntarily eludes justice, the authorities where the warrant was issued have been unable to locate the accused, or those authorities refuse to cooperate with the tribunal.</P>

<P>The purpose of the hearing is to allow prosecutors to convince tribunal judges to issue an international arrest warrant. The effect of this warrant is to make the accused international fugitives, and obliges any U.N. member to arrest them. The U.N. can impose sanctions against any nation failing to make an arrest.</P>

<P>In order to have the warrants issued, prosecutors must show reasonable grounds for believing that Karadzic and Mladic committed the crimes with which they are charged. This is done by submitting to the judges the evidence on which the indictment was based, and calling witnesses.</P>

<P>This is not a hearing to determine guilt. Therefore, no defense case is presented.</P>

<P>Rule 61 is called "The Voice of the Victims" because it allows the alleged victims of these crimes an opportunity to testify in public and to have their testimony recorded for posterity. The tribunal creates an historical record against the accused which it hopes will encourage political leaders to adopt a "robust policy with regard to the effective arrest of the accused." </P>

<P><b>The Accused</b><br>
General Ratko Mladic, a career military officer, has been commander of the Bosnian Serb Army since March of 1992. He is a former commander of the Yugoslav People's Army.</P>

<P>Dr. Radovan Karadzic has been president of the Bosnian Serb administration based in Pale since May of 1992. He also is the founder and president of the Serbian Democratic Party of what was then the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</P>

<P>The Dayton Peace Agreement bans Karadzic and Mladic from power because they are indicted war criminals. However, the two have ignored the provisions, and Karadzic has refused to remove himself as a candidate in elections scheduled for September 14. </P>

<h2>International War Crimes Tribunal: A Glossary</h2>

<P>The International War Crimes Tribunal currently taking place in the Hague references many names, words and places that are unfamiliar to most Americans. This glossary is a guide to the most important terms you're likely to come across while watching the trial. Court TV anchor Ray Brown originally wrote it as a guide for our on-air anchors and reporters. We've expanded it here so we can share it with you.</P>

<BR><A NAME="A"><H2>A</H2></A>
<P><B>ACCUSED</B><BR>
A person against whom an indictment has been submitted, according to tribunal's rules of procedure and evidence.</P>

<P><B>ADMINISTRATION BUILDING (AT OMARSKA)</B><BR>
Where, allegedly, interrogations took place and most of the women were confined.</P>

<P><B>ALBRIGHT, MADELEINE</B><BR>
U.S. United Nations ambassador. On August 9, 1995, Albright showed the United Nations Security Council photos of mass graves at Srbrenica, a United Nations safe area. This confirmed the July massacre and mass burial at that site but also raised questions concerning the failure of U.S. intelligence to share such information earlier.</P> 

<P><B>ARBOUR, LOUISE</B><BR>
A member of Ontario's Court of Appeal, Arbour is scheduled to replace Richard Goldstone as prosecutor of the international war crimes tribunal in October 1996.</P>

<BR><A NAME="B"><H2>B</H2></A>
<P><B>BABIC, GORAN</B><BR>
An alibi witness for defendant Dusko Tadic.</P>

<P><B>BANJA LUCA</B><BR>
A town seized by Ratko Mladic in April 1992 as a staging area for Bosnian Serbs in northern Bosnia. It has long served as a tank training facility and major military stronghold for the JNA.</P>

<P><B>BASSIOUNI, CHERIF</B><BR>
Professor of Law at DePaul University. Member and later Chairman of United Nations Commission Of Experts Established Pursuant To Security Council Resolution 780 (1992), charged with collecting war crimes evidence in the former Yugoslavia.</P>
 
<P><B>BELGRADE</B><BR>
Capital of Serbia and of the former Yugoslavia.</P>

<P><B>BLEWITT, GRAHAM</B><BR>
A tribunal prosecutor, former director of the Nazi war crimes investigation unit of the Australian equivalent of the FBI. Blewitt has been with the tribunal since its inception.</P>

<P><B>BOBAN, MATE</B><BR>
Leader of the Bosnian Croats. Boban was allegedly hand-picked by President Tudjman of Croatia to replace Stjepjan Kjuic to head the HDZ in February 1992. Kjuic is said to have had more HDZ support but was unpopular in Croatia because he was an advocate for an independent Bosnia-Herzegovina. Boban met Karadzic in Gratz, Austria in May 1992 to orchestrate the division of Bosnia between the Serbs and Croats.</P>

<P><B>BOROVNICA, GORAN</B><BR>
Defendant Dusko Tadic's co-defendant, who has never been in custody in the Hague and will not be on trial with him. He is mentioned in only one section of the indictment.</P>

<P><B>BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA</B><BR>
A republic of the former Yugoslavia and a historic Balkan entity. Of the various republics, only Bosnia-Herzegovina has a history of multi-ethnic cooperation. It has been decimated by the "ethnic cleansing" of the establishment of the Serb Republic at Pale and has been a Croatian enclave.</P>
It is likely that without the Dayton Peace accords and the presence of IFOR (committed to depart December 20, 1996) there might be no Bosnia-Herzegovina. At the start of the war its population was 40 percent Muslim, 32 percent Serb and 18 percent Croat. After its recognition by the European Community and the U.S. in early April 1992, the military offensive -- of which defendant Dusko Tadic's conduct is a tactically significant element -- began.</P>
At Dayton in November 1995 the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina was pressured by military necessity and the western powers to accept a new structure. The Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina remains a sovereign state with two "entities": the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republika Srspka (Pale).</P> 

<BR><A NAME="C"><H2>C</H2></A>
<P><B>CAMP LISA</B><BR>
First Armored Division Camp (IFOR). It is 13 miles from Hans Pjesak, which houses "fugitive" Ratko Mladic, indicted by the tribunal prosecutor for genocide.</P>

<P><B>CASSESE, ANTONIO</B><BR>
Italian, president of the tribunal and head of the five-judge Appeals Chambers. <I>The American Lawyer</I> magazine has described him as "an international law professor at the University of Florence who has written extensively on war crimes."</P>

<P><B><I>COMPETENCE RATIONE MATERIAE</B></I><BR>
This term refers to the tribunal's subject matter jurisdiction, which stems from customary law as well as conventional law.</P>

<P><B>CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY</B><BR>
The foundation for crimes against humanity is found in the United Nations Charter and the Nuremberg Judgment. The allegations against defendant Dusko Tadic would seem to fall within eight of the nine subsections defining crimes against humanity, including murder, extermination, torture and rape. The defendant Dusko Tadic is charged with crimes against humanity, among other things.</P>

<P><B>CROATIA</B><BR>
A republic of the former Yugoslavia and a historic Balkan entity. Its national religion has been Roman Catholicism since the time of the Holy Roman Empire. It has demonstrated territorial designs on Bosnia-Herzegovina during the current conflict. However, it has also been intermittently allied with the Bosnian Muslims in resistance to Serbian claims.</P>
During World War II Croatia's Ustasa regime exterminated Jews, Gypsies and between 250,000 and 750,000 Serbs. Serbian nationalists have alluded to this fact repeatedly during the current conflict. The use by the newly independent Croatia of the famous checkered flag and other symbols of the Ustasa regime have exacerbated this tension.</P>

<BR><A NAME="D"><H2>D</H2></A>
<P><B>DAYTON PEACE ACCORD</B><BR>
Officially the "General Framework Agreement For Peace In Bosnia and Herzegovina," this was originally signed in Dayton on November 21, 1995 by Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (for itself and Republika Srpska). It was witnessed by France, Germany, the Russian Federation, Britain, the U.S. and the European Union. It recognizes the sovereignty of The Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the existence of its two "entities," the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Republika Srspka. It recognizes amnesty for all returning refugees except those charged with "common crime unrelated to the conflict" and those indicted by the tribunal prosecutor. Other relevant provisions: It said that no person may hold office in Bosnia-Herzegovina who is not in compliance with directives of the tribunal; it established a United Nations International Police Task Force (ITPF) to report human rights violations to the tribunal; and it established IFOR, NATO's peacekeeping force in the area.</P>

<P><B>DEFERRAL</B><BR>
Rules 8 and 10 provide that the prosecutor may request that a state defer prosecution of a person who may have committed violations under the tribunal's jurisdiction so that such a person may be tried at the Hague. Such a request was in fact made to Germany, which had charged defendant Dusko Tadic with genocide.</P>

<P><B>DULE</B><BR>
Alias for defendant Dusko Tadic, listed in the indictment.</P>

<BR><A NAME="E"><H2>E</H2></A>

<P><B>ETHNIC CLEANSING</B><BR>
According to a United Nations report, ethnic cleansing is defined as "rendering an area ethnically homogenous by using force or intimidation to remove from a given area persons from another ethnic or religious group."</P>

<BR><A NAME="F"><H2>F</H2></A>
<P><B>"F"</B><BR>
Allegedly a victim of crimes against humanity, grave breaches and violations of the customs of war. The prosecution moved on May 3, 1996 -- four days before trial -- to dismiss these charges concerning "F". It is assumed that she was reluctant to testify.</P>

<BR><A NAME="G"><H2>G</H2></A>
<P><B>"G"</B><BR>
A prisoner at Omarska who was allegedly beaten and sexually assaulted by defendant Dusko Tadic and other Serbs in June and July 1992.

Additionally, this witness may testify by one-way closed circuit television in closed session.</P>

<P><B>GARAGE</B><BR>
A building at Omarska, also known as the hangar.</P>

<P><B>GENOCIDE</B><BR>
The 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide defines genocide as "acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group." (Note that defendant Dusko Tadic is not charged with genocide.) The indictment of July 25, 1995 charges Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic with genocide against Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims.</P>

<P><B>GOLDSTONE, RICHARD</B><BR>
Chief tribunal prosecutor and former chair of the Goldstone Commission, which looked into the causes of South African violence.</P>

<P><B>GRAVE BREACHES</B><BR>
The definition of grave breaches is drawn from the Geneva Convention of 1949. It prohibits a wide range of violent conduct, including but not limited to killing, torture or inhuman treatment, and willfully causing great suffering. Defendant Dusko Tadic is charged, among other things, with grave breaches.</P>

<P><B>GUTMAN, ROY</B><BR>
The first journalist to visit Serbian concentration camp Omarska. Author of a series of articles in New York daily newspaper <I>Newsday</I> in August 1992 describing the Serbian camps; the series earned him a Pulitzer prize. It was later published as a book, <I>Eyewitness to Genocide</I>.</P>

<BR><A NAME="H"><H2>H</H2></A>
<P><B>"H"</B><BR>
A prisoner at Omarska who was allegedly beaten and sexually assaulted by defendant Dusko Tadic and other Serbs in June and July 1992. The address, whereabouts and other identifying information about this witness shall not be disclosed. Additionally, this witness may testify by one-way closed circuit television in closed session.</P>

<P><B>HANGAR</B><BR>
A building at Omarska, also known as the garage.</P>

<P><B>HANS PJESAK</B><BR>
A bunker complex originally built for Tito, founder of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It is currently the dwelling of fugitive Ratko Mladic and is 13 miles from the 1st Armored Division's Camp Lisa.</P>


<P><B>HDZ</B><BR>
A center-right nationalist party led by Franjo Tudjman which first came to power in Zagreb in April 1990. In February 1992 Stjsepan Kljuic, an advocate of a unified Bosnia, was ousted by a minority of the Bosnia wing of the party in favor of Tudjman's candidate, Herzegovinian Mate Boban.</P>


<BR><A NAME="I"><H2>I</H2></A>
<P><B>"I"</B><BR>
From deliberately cryptic references in prosecution motions, it appears that "I" witnessed events at Omarska, possibly including the sexual assault of "F" and mistreatment of "G". The address, whereabouts, and other identifying information about this witness shall not be disclosed. Additionally, this witness may testify by one-way closed circuit television in closed session.</P>


<P><B>ICTY</B><BR>
See INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL.</P>

<P><B>IFOR</B><BR>

<P><B>INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL</B><BR>
Officially, the international tribunal for the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991 (ICTY). The tribunal was established pursuant to United Nations Resolution 808. It consists of judicial chambers, a prosecutor and a registry.</P>

<P><B>IZETBEGOVIC, ALIJA</B><BR>
Leader of Party for Democratic Action (SDA, Muslim), founded in 1990, and the first president of the Collective Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In 1970 he wrote a volume called <I>The Islamic Declaration</I> about the relationship of politics to Islam. Although it is a general treatise which does not mention Bosnia, it was used as evidence in his 1983 trial for "counterrevolutionary acts derived from Muslim nationalism." In 1988 he was released early from his 11-year sentence. He has generally been viewed as an advocate for an ethnically mixed Bosnia.</P>

<BR><A NAME="J"><H2>J</H2></A>
<P><B>"J"</B><BR>
A witness to the June 1992 events at Sivci and Jaskici. The address, whereabouts, and other identifying information about this witness shall not be disclosed. Additionally, this witness may testify in closed session.</P>


<P><B>JASKICI</B><BR>
An area southeast of Prijedor where armed Serbs, including defendant Dusko Tadic, beat and shot a group of Bosnian Muslims in June 1992.</P>

<P><B>JNA</B><BR>

<BR><A NAME="K"><H2>K</H2></A>
<P><B>"K"</B><BR>
A witness to the June 1992 events at Sivci and Jaskici. The address, whereabouts, and other identifying information about this witness shall not be disclosed. Additionally, this witness may testify in closed session.</P>

<P><B>KARADZIC, RADOVAN</B><BR>
The political leader of the Bosnian Serbs. He is the head of the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) and president of the Serb Republic, with headquarters at Pale, just outside Sarajevo. On July 25, 1995 he was indicted by the tribunal along with Ratko Mladic and was charged with, among other things, genocide against Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats. Before the war he was a psychiatrist at Kosevo Hospital in Sarajevo and, like many current Serb nationalist leaders, was reputed to have Muslim friends. The press has reported that for political reasons he has been permitted to pass through both IFOR and UNPROFOR roadblocks since his indictment without being apprehended. Karadzic also fancies himself a poet.</P>

<P><B>KERATERM</B><BR>
Along with Omarska and Trnopolje, one of three internment camps in the Prijedor region used by Serbs to commit atrocities against Muslims and Croats. It previously had been a ceramics factory.</P>

<P><B>KNEZEVIC, DUDAN</B><BR>
The original indictment claimed that in June or July 1992, defendant Dusko Tadic and Knezevic allegedly forced prisoners to "drink water like animals from puddles on the ground" and beat them. The amended indictment omits Knezevic's name.</P>

<P><B>KOSOVO</B><BR>
An autonomous region of the former Yugoslavia. Slobodan Milosevic's support of the Serbian minority here against the Albnian majority in 1987 is viewed by many as the beginning of the end for the former Yugoslavia. It is an area with deep significance for the Serbs: In 1389 the Ottoman Turks ended the reign of medieval Serbia here by beheading Prince Lazar.</P>

<P><B>KOZARAC</B><BR>
Home of defendant Dusko Tadic. Before the war Kozarac was a largely Muslim town of about 25,000. The prosecutor alleges that in May 1992 Serb forces seized Bosnian Muslim and Croat people around Kozarac and forced them to march to Kozarac for transfer to prison camps.</P>

<P><B>KRAJINA</B><BR>
The traditional name for the area that extends along the border of and into Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.</P>

<BR><A NAME="L"><H2>L</H2></A>
<P><B>LCY</B><BR>
League of Communists of Yugoslavia.</P>

<BR><A NAME="M"><H2>M</H2></A>
<P><B>"M"</B><BR>
An alibi witness for defendant Dusko Tadic. Witness is said by the defense to be living at Omarska.</P>

<P><B>MACEDONIA</B><BR>
A republic of the former Yugoslavia.</P>

<P><B>MARTIC, MILAN</B><BR>
President of the Croatian Serb Administration at Knin. He was indicted in July 1995 for his part in ordering the shelling of Zagreb.</P>

<P><B>McDONALD, GABRIELLE KIRK</B><BR>
Former federal district court judge from Houston, Texas, and presiding judge of the Tadic trial chamber.</P>

<P><B>MILOSEVIC, SLOBODAN</B><BR>
President of Serbia and, in the view of many, the man who ignited the current Balkan conflagration. While the former Yugoslavia was still a functioning entity in 1987, he traveled to Kosovo, ostensibly to reduce tensions between the Albnians and the Serb minority. While there he began to fan the flames of Serb nationalism. (Ironically, Milosevic had declined to endorse a memorandum drafted in the mid-80's by the Serb Academy of Arts and Science, which articulated many Serb grievances.)</P>

<P>Milosevic was a prime moving force behind the split with Croatia and Slovenia at the time of the Extraordinary Congress in 1990. He made significant efforts to centralize the power of the JNA and the state apparatus of former Yugoslavian Belgrade. He has been accused of being the <I>eminence gris</I> behind the Bosnian Serbs, and there is reason to believe that Bosnia is pursuing a charge of genocide against the Belgrade regime in the World Court for the purpose of putting pressure on the tribunal to indict Milosevic. In March 1991 Tudjman and Milosevic met and agreed upon a plan for the partition of Bosnia.</P>

<P><B>MLADIC, RATKO</B><BR>
Appointed commander of the JNA in May 1992. For most of the current conflict he has commanded all Bosnian Serb military forces. The indictment of July 25, 1995 charges Mladic and Karadzic with genocide against Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims. Mladic is a notorious beneficiary of IFOR's fear of "mission creep." As of April 1996 he was staying at Hans Pjesak, a bunker complex built for Yugoslav republic founder Tito, which is 13 miles from the First Armored Division's Camp Lisa. Mladic was a career officer in the JNA and was not known as a nationalist before the recent conflicts, although it is said that both of his parents were slain by Croatian fascists during World War II.</P>

<P><B>MONTENEGRO</B><BR>
A republic of the former Yugoslavia, currently dominated by Serbian allies of Slobodan Milosevic.</P>

<BR><A NAME="N"><H2>N</H2></A>
<P><B>"N"</B><BR>
An alibi witness for defendant Dusko Tadic. The defense says this witness is living at Priejedor.</P>

<P><B>NIKOLIK, DRAGAN</B><BR>
In September 1994 this Serbian camp commandant became the first person charged with international war crimes since Nuremberg. He was indicted in connection with his activities at Susica, which housed Muslims from the Vlasenica area from June - September 1992. A former guard at the facility, Pero Popovic, appears to be the principal witness against Nikolik.</P>

<P><B>NON-BIS-IN-DEM</B><BR>
Literally, "not twice for the same." The statute of the tribunal and its rules of procedure and evidence attempt to address our concept of double jeopardy: It prohibits a second trial before a national tribunal and bars the tribunal from trying anyone previously convicted before a national tribunal, provided that the prior charge was not an "ordinary crime" and that the tribunal was "impartial."</P>

<P><B><I>NULLUM CRIMEN SINE LEGE</I></B><BR>
The great "principle of legality" pursuant to which there can be no crime without law.  This is addressed in the Statute of the Tribunal.</P>

<BR><A NAME="O"><H2>O</H2></A>
<P><B>"O"</B><BR>

<P><B>POPOVICH, PERO</B><BR>
The principal witness against Serbian camp commandant Dragan Nikolic, the first person charged with international war crimes since Nuremberg.</P>

<P><B>PRIJEDOR</B><BR>
Before the war, the second largest city in northern Bosnia. It had slightly more Muslims than Serbs. Most of the Muslim males were shipped to death camps.</P>

<P><B><I>PROPRIO MOTU</I></B><BR>
More than just another Latin phrase, this way of saying "on one's own motion" as it appears in Rule 54 gives the court the ability to issue warrants for the prosecution, defense, or itself "as may be necessary for the purpose of an investigation or for the preparation or conduct of the trial." It reflects the reality of European civil law systems, in which the judge is frequently an active participant with the prosecutor.</P>

<BR><A NAME="R"><H2>R</H2></A>
<P><B><I>RATIONE PERSONAE</I></B><BR>

Its existence as one of the entities which comprise the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina was acknowledged at Dayton. Radovan Karadzic is its president.</P>

<P><B>SERBIA</B><BR>
A republic of the former Yugoslavia. Serbia is also, however, a name given to various kingdoms, autonomous regions and sections of empires, including the Byzantine, Ottoman and Hapsburg. Serbia is strongly identified with the Eastern Orthodox Church. The current incarnation of the age-old quest for Greater Serbia fueled the current carnage in the Balkans.</P>

<P><B>STEPHEN, SIR NINIAN</B><BR>
Former member of the Australian High Court and British Privy Council, Governor-General of Australia, and member of the Tadic trial chamber. Stephen authored an interesting dissent in response to the prosecutor's motion for the protection of witnesses and victims.</P>

<P><B>SUSPECT</B><BR>
A person concerning whom the prosecutor possesses reliable information which tends to show that he may have committed a crime over which the tribunal has jurisdiction. Suspects have rights to counsel and to remain silent as well as a Miranda-type prophylactic protection. The prosecutor is also required to audiotape or videotape questioning of suspects. An indigent accused or suspect will have counsel assigned.</P>

<BR><A NAME="T"><H2>T</H2></A>
<P><B>TADIC, DUSKO</B><BR>
A Serb, Dusko Tadic is the first defendant to be tried before the tribunal. He was indicted on February 13, 1995 along with Goran Borovnica. He is charged with grave breaches, violations of the laws and customs of war, and crimes against humanity. The allegations stem from his alleged activities at Omarska camp and in the Priejdor district in northeastern Bosnia from May - July 1992.</P>
To some nationalist Serbs Tadic is a martyr. To some observers he is a culpable scapegoat being used to satisfy the troubled conscience of the Western powers for their failure to intervene in Bosnia. The Germans, who had already charged Tadic with genocide, released him into the custody of the tribunal in April 1995. Like some other contemporary Serb nationalists, this former policeman, cafe owner and karate instructor from Kozarac is reputed to have had cordial pre-war relationships with Muslims.</P>

<P><B>TITO, JOSIP BROZ (1892-1980) </B><BR>
Born in Croatia of mixed Slovenian and Croatian ancestry, Tito was decorated, wounded, then captured by the Russians during World War I. He joined the Communist Party in the 1920s. During World War II he led partisans against the Axis powers as well as other Balkan forces (Chetniks, Ustasi, etc.) and after the war founded the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He effectively stifled Yugoslavia's ethnic rivalries with a firm hand (and the somewhat ironic slogan "Brotherhood and Unity") while remaining non-aligned in world politics.</P>

<P><B>TRIBUNAL</B><BR>
Officially, the international tribunal for the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991 (ICTY). The tribunal was established pursuant to United Nations Resolution 808. It consists of judicial chambers, a prosecutor and a registry. It is the first body established for such purposes since Nuremberg.</P>

<P><B>TRNOPOLJE</B><BR>
With Omarska and Keraterm, one of the three primary internment camps used by the Serbs during their ethnic cleansing campaign in the Prijedor region. Trnopolje was regarded as the least odious of the three, and those few who were released from the other two camps sometimes made their way here.</P>

<P><B>TUDJMAN, FRANJO</B><BR>
A Croatian nationalist, head of the HDZ, and since April 1990 President of Croatia. Since coming to power he has adopted for Croatia many emblems and symbols of the World War II Croatian fascists. Tudjman is a former general and high-ranking Communist. In March 1991 Tudjman and Milosevic met and agreed upon a plan for the partition of Bosnia.</P>

<BR><A NAME="U"><H2>U</H2></A>

<P><B>VERCEK, VESNA</B><BR>
An alibi witness for defendant Dusko Tadic.</P>

<P><B>VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OR CUSTOMS OF WAR</B><BR>
This definition is drawn from the customary and conventional law as informed by the Hague Convention of 1907, the Geneva Convention of 1949, and the Nuremberg Tribunal. It generally prohibits the use of force "not justified by military necessity" against villages, dwellings, etc. The defendant Dusko Tadic is charged with this, among other things.</P>

<P><B>VOJVODINO</B><BR>

The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (the former Yugoslavia) was a political entity formed with six Republics and two autonomous regions by Tito in 1944. Its effective demise began with the 14th Extraordinary Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (LCY) in 1990, when Slovenia and Croatia began their secession activities in response to Serbian nationalist activities in Kosovo led by Slobodan Milosevic. In April 1992 the European Community and U.S. recognized Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Serbs began the offensive which led to defendant Dusko Tadic's activities. At the same time Serbia and Montenegro formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, maintaining control of the JNA and most of the revenues of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</P>

<H2>Who's Who at the War Crimes Trial</H2>

<BR>
<P><b>THE JUDGES</b></P>

<P><b>Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, United States, presiding judge: </b><br>
The sole judge from the United States, and one of two female judges at the International Criminal Tribunal, Judge McDonald is used to chartering new ground. Born in St. Paul and raised in Manhattan, Judge McDonald, 54, attended Boston University and Hunter College, but never earned a degree. She then entered Howard University School of Law and graduated first in her class. Her first job out of law school was working as a staff attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. She moved to Texas in 1969 and joined her then-husband Mark McDonald's solo practice. For the next decade, the couple specialized in plaintiffs' discrimination cases, including a 1976 settlement for $1.2 million against the Lone Star Steel Company. At the request of  Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, President Jimmy Carter nominated her to the U.S. District Court in Houston, becoming only the third African-American woman appointed to the federal bench. She quit the bench in 1988, worn out by a crushing caseload and a low salary. She moved to Austin, worked for two different firms, and was set to return to Houston for a one-year teaching stint at the Thurgood Marshall School of Law at Texas Christian University, when she was asked to join the international court.</P>

<P><b>Datuk Lal Vohrah, Malaysia, judge:</b><br>
Born in 1934, Judge Vohrah served as a High Court Judge in Malaysia for more than 15 years. He has attended several international treaty conferences, such as the U.N. Conference on the Law of Treaties in Vienna in 1969, and the U.N. Conference on the Law of the Sea in Caracas in 1974.</P>

<P><b>Sir Ninian Stephen, Australia, judge:</b><br>
Born in 1923, Judge Stephen was appointed to the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1970, hearing both civil and criminal matters. He was appointed to the Privy Council in 1979 and sat on its Judicial Committee. From 1982 to 1989, he was the Governor-General of  Australia.</P>

<BR>
<P><b>THE PROSECUTION TEAM</B></P>

<P><b>Richard Goldstone,  South Africa, Chief Prosecutor: </b><br>
Currently on leave from his seat on South Africa's Supreme Court, Richard Goldstone, 56, was appointed to the post of chief prosecutor in July 1994. Goldstone is a hero to the anti-apartheid forces in his homeland. He was the sole investigator of an incident where the South African police fired into a crowd of 50,000 demonstrators. The investigation resulted in the prosecution of police for unlawful use of force. Since 1991, Goldstone has also led an investigation into human rights abuses by all of South Africa's political parties and security forces. He was asked to join the tribunal by Nelson Mandela; his role is seen as part of South Africa's re-emergence into the international community.</P>

<P>Goldstone will return to the bench in South Africa this fall. Eloquent  and commanding, Goldstone has been the public face of the tribunal and has lobbied tirelessly on its behalf. Goldstone, along with Chief Judge Antonio Cassese of  Italy, have relentlessly pestered the U.N. bureaucracy to insure the International Criminal Tribunal has adequate funding. It was Goldstone who traveled to Washington, D.C., on the eve of the negotiations for the Dayton Agreement and met with Secretary of State Warren Christopher and President Bill Clinton to persuade them not to sell out the tribunal during the talks.</P>

<P><b>Graham Blewitt, Australia, Deputy Prosecutor:</b><br>
Graham Blewitt led Australia's prosecution of former Nazi war criminals. He headed the Australian equivalent of the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Special Investigations, which has brought deportation proceedings against alleged former Nazis who lied on their immigration documents.</P>

<P><b>Grant Niemann, Australia, chief prosecutor in the Tadic case:</b><br>
Grant Niemann is another Australian known for his prosecution of Nazi war criminals, and was recruited for the tribunal by Blewitt. Before joining the tribunal, Niemann was the deputy director of the Public Prosecution for South Australia in Adelaide, a position roughly equivalent to that of a U.S. Attorney.</P>

<P><b>Alan Tieger, United States, Tadic prosecutor:</b><br>
Alan Tieger is a U.S. lawyer, on loan from the Justice Department's criminal section of the civil rights division. He was a prosecutor in the federal trial of four Los Angeles police officers accused of beating Rodney King. He joined the tribunal in June 1994 and is paid by the U.S. government.</P>

<P><b>Lt. Col. Brenda Hollis, United States, Tadic prosecutor:</b><br>
Brenda Hollis is a U.S. lawyer on loan from U.S. Air Force Judge Advocate General's office. She is a former Air Force circuit prosecutor and appellate government counsel. She joined the tribunal in July 1994, and is paid by the U.S. government.</P>

<P>Major Michael Keegan, United States, Tadic prosecutor:</b><br>
Michael Keegan is a U.S. lawyer on loan from the U.S. Marine Corps Judge Advocate General's office. He  joined the tribunal June 1994, and is paid by the U.S. government.</P>

<BR>
<P><b>THE DEFENSE TEAM</b></P>

<P><b>Michail Wladimiroff, Netherlands, lead defense counsel:</b><br>
Michail Wladimiroff is a Dutch attorney and a part-time professor of economic criminal law at the University of Utrecht. He is the senior partner in the Hague's 16-lawyer Wladimiroff & Spong, the largest criminal defense firm in the Netherlands. A white-collar crime expert, he successfully defended the directors of Slavenburg bank (now part of Credit Lyonnais) against charges of falsifying bank records. Wladimiroff was appointed in April 1995 and is paid by the tribunal at the rate of $23 an hour for a maximum of $200 a day. His usual rate is $350 a day.</P>

<P><b>Alphons Orie, Netherlands, Tadic defense:</B><br>
Alphons Orie is Wladimiroff's younger partner.</P>

<P><b>Steven Kay, United Kingdom, Tadic defense:</b><br>
A British litigator, Steven Kay was brought in a few months ago to help Orie and Wladimiroff learn cross-examination and adversarial procedure.</P>

<h2>The Defendant and the Charges</h2>

<P>Dusko Tadic, 40, (born 10/1/55) is a former cocktail lounge owner from the town of  Kozarac in northwestern Bosnia. He was also a part-time karate instructor, and by all accounts, this Serb, like many others, enjoyed good relations with Muslims and Croats before the war. He is married, with two daughters, and two brothers. </P>

<P>However, Tadic allegedly became intoxicated with Serbian nationalist propaganda, which was rampant in the region in 1991. He banned Muslims from his bar, and later allegedly helped compile lists of prominent Muslim intellectuals and politicians who were to be killed as part of the Serb ethnic cleansing of the region. Eventually,  Tadic became a leader of Serb paramilitary forces, although he had no rank and did not wear a uniform.</P>

<P>Tadic was arrested in Munich by German authorities in February 1994 and placed in detention. He was then extradited to the tribunal after the German parliament passed a special law enabling the transfer. Tadics capture was partially the result of his own recklessness and stupidity. Tadic allegedly looted many Muslims. Although he had a lot of cash, back home in Kozarac he had no place to spend it. He then moved to Munich to spend his new wealth, making Tadic an easy target for arrest.</P>

<P><b>Omarska</b><br>
In the spring and summer of 1992, military and police forces of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Republic of Serbia took prisoners at four major detention camps in northwestern Bosnia. The three main camps, Omarska, Keraterm, Trnopolje were in Prijedor.  The fourth, Manjaca was south of Banja Luka. Omarska is considered to have been the most brutal of the camps. Some of Tadics alleged crimes were committed at Omarska, where an estimated 10,000 people -- mostly Muslims but some Croats -- were held between May and August 1992.</P>

<P>Omarska was a predominantly Serbian village in the Prejidor region where an open iron ore mine operated. After intensive shelling by the Serbs caused Muslims to flee their homes, the mine was converted into a prison camp. Muslims and Croats were rounded up and led to the camp. Omarska was where those who were considered to be leaders or prominent citizens in the non-Serb community, or had actively resisted the Serb takeover, were sent. Many were part of the local Muslim and Croat elite  -- political, religious, intellectual and business leaders. The conditions were horrifying.</P>

<P>In the late summer of 1992, the world learned that Omarska was less like a refugee camp and more like a concentration camp. The first print reporter to uncover Omarska was Newsdays Roy Gutman, who won the Pulitzer Prize for his efforts. The first video out of Omarska, which came at the same time, was shot by International Television News (ITN). The allegations against the Serbs who controlled Omarska are gruesome:  murder, rape, torture, and sodomy. The allegations of the survivors provided the basis for many of the indictments now issued by the ICTYs prosecutor, including the case against Dusko Tadic.</P>

<P>Here are some excerpts from Helsinki Watch interviews with former Omarska prisoners:</P>

<P>When men left the bus [after arriving at Omarska], guards would beat them. Four men who observed this tried to escape. Three of them were killed with rifles...The bodies of the three who were killed were not removed -- they lay on the ground for seven days. It was hot, and the bodies putrified.</P>

<P>One hundred and fifty people were put into a garage, where they could barely stand. Three men there suffocated to death, and their bodies were just put near the other three corpses.</P>

<P>They put us in room number 15.  Muslim policemen and local businessmen were taken out and killed that same night...For the first sixty hours, we were given no food or water and we had to relieve ourselves in the same room. Later, they started giving us an eighth of a loaf of bread each per day, although it often happened we would go for 48 hours without any food.</P>

<P>They kept 180 of us in a garage which was four by five meters in size. The first five days we were not given any water. It was so humid in there that the plaster was peeling off the walls. We had to relieve ourselves in the room. They started filling our shoes with water and letting us drink water out of our shoes. They sometimes urinated in the water we were given to drink.</P>

<P>Five or six [guards] were always standing in front of the kitchen armed with sticks. They enjoyed pouring water on the tiled floor, and whoever fell would be beaten to death.</P>

<P>The most traumatic experience for me was to see all the corpses. We saw corpses piled one on top of another, and some of the bodies had been there for 48 hours....The bodies eventually were gathered with a forklift and put onto trucks.... This happened almost every day -- sometimes there was a lesser number of bodies -- 20 or 30 -- but usually there were more.  Most of the deaths occurred as a result of beatings.</P>

<P>There are no reliable estimates as to how many people were killed at Omarska, but some human rights advocates believe it is at least hundreds, and probably thousands.</P>

<P>Later, an October 1995 push by Bosnian forces turned Omarska back into a refugee camp. This time, Serbs were the refugees fleeing their homes and forced into the camp.</P>

<P><b>The Charges Against Tadic</b><br>
Tadic is charged with crimes against humanity, violations of the laws or customs of war, and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949. Tadic is not charged with the most serious crime -- genocide -- and he is not charged with command responsibility. Although Tadic was originally charged with one count of rape, marking the first time rape had been prosecuted as a war crime, this charge did not make it to trial. Prosecutors dropped the count on their own initiative, most likely because the alleged victim would not testify.</P>

<P>Crimes Committed Inside Omarska<br>
<UL TYPE=DISC>

<LI>Belonged to a group of Serbs from outside the Omarska camp who one day called prisoners out of their rooms and severely beat them. After one of the four prisoners was beaten, two other prisoners were called on and ordered by a member of the group (it is unclear whether it was Tadic who gave the order) to lick his buttocks and genitals and then to sexually mutilate him. One of the two prisoners covered the third prisoner's mouth to silence his screams, while the other prisoner bit off his testicle. This prisoner and two others died from the attack, the fourth was severely injured and thrown into the back of a truck with the dead and driven away.<BR>

<LI>Belonged to various groups of Serbs from outside the Omarska camp who severely beat and kicked at least five prisoners, three of whom died.<BR>

<LI>Belonged to a group of Serbs from outside the Omarska camp who ordered prisoners to drink water like animals from puddles on the ground, jumped on their backs, and beat them until they could no longer move. As the victims were removed, Tadic discharged a fire extinguisher into the mouth of one of the prisoners.<BR>
</UL></P>

<P>Crimes Committed Outside Omarska<br>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>Belonged to a group of Serbs who pushed four prisoners out of a column of Bosnian Muslim residents of the Kozarac area who were forced to march toward the town of Kozarac prior to being bussed to one of the camps, pushed them against a wall, and shot them. Another Serb indicted with Tadic, Goran Borovnica, is alleged to have also participated in this incident.<BR>

<LI>Belonged to two groups of Serbs who forced Muslims in the villages of Sivci and Jaskici to leave their homes.  In Sivci, five men were shot and killed in front of their houses.  In Jaskici, six men were forced to lie on the ground, were beaten with a thick wooden stick, kicked, and then taken to an unknown destination.<BR>

<h2>History of the Balkan Conflict</h2>

<P>Painful as it may be, to understand the case of Dusko Tadic, one needs to be familiar with the war in Bosnia. To understand the war in Bosnia, it helps to understand the Balkans. What follows is a brief outline of the main ethnic/religious groups and their roles in the region before the war in 1992. </P>

<P>Despite the animosity and mistrust among the historical enemies in the Balkans, all of the parties in the former Yugoslavia share one important trait:  they are all Slavs. Furthermore, a careful consideration of the region's history suggests they all arrived around the same time.</P>

<P>The first Slavs came to the Balkan region in the sixth century. By the mid-seventh century two new Slav tribes appeared in the region: the Serbs and the Croats. The Serbs and Croats each settled in areas which roughly correspond to their modern national boundaries. Neither group was Christian; both probably practiced some form of paganism.</P>

<P>Early in medieval history, three separate religious groups were defined in the Balkan region. In the early middle ages, Serb Slavs became more aligned with the Byzantine Empire to the east and, as a consequence, the Eastern Orthodox faith. On the other side, Croats and the Slavs of Bosnia were aligned with the Hungarian Empire and the Catholic Church. The isolation and remote nature of much of Bosnia, however, created a different church which attracted many Slavs in Bosnia: the Bosnian Church.</P>

<P><b>Islamicization in Bosnia</b><br>
In 1463, Ottomans overran Bosnia. Within a few years, a large Muslim population developed. How Muslims came to dominate Bosnia is hotly contested. Some say the Islamicization was a product of immigration rather than conversion. Some argue that Bosnians converted in order to lord over their Serb neighbors: Only Muslims could have leadership roles in the Ottoman state and Muslims enjoyed superior legal status in the Ottoman Empire. In addition, slaves who converted to Islam were automatically freed. Finally, many Muslim Slavs immigrated to Bosnia as the areas Muslim population grew.</P>

<P><b>19th Century to World War I</b><br>
The Ottoman occupation of the Balkans lasted until the mid-nineteenth century with varying degrees of control. Throughout this period, Bosnian Muslims were the dominant ethnic-religious group in the Balkan political arena. The Serbs were a vocal political minority.</P>

<P>By the end of the nineteenth century, however, the Ottoman Empire was collapsing and its control over the Balkan region ended. In 1878, the Treaties of San Stefan and Berlin recognized Serbia as an independent kingdom. At the same time, the Hapsburg monarchy occupied Bosnia; it would officially annex the region in 1908.</P>

<P>World War I began with the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand, heir to the Hapsburg throne, by Serbian nationalists chaffing under the threats by the Austro-Hungarians to annex Serbia. World War I marked the end of the Ottoman and the Hapsburg empires.</P>

<P><b>Creation of Yugoslavia</b><br>
In December 1918, in the wake of World War I, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was formed, renamed Yugoslavia in 1929. In World War II, Germany invaded the region, forcing the ruling monarchy into exile. There were two resistance groups: chetnicks, royalists eager to re-establish the control of  the monarch and the partisans, a communist group led by General Tito. In 1943, the two groups turned against each other. By 1944, the Germans had withdrawn and Tito -- with the backing of the Russians and the presence of the Red Army -- moved toward the establishment of the communist state of Yugoslavia.</P>

<P>In 1946, a new constitution created six republics within the federal republic of Yugoslavia: Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia, Bosnia-Hercegovina, Croatia and Slovenia. Tito ruled the communist Yugoslavia until his death in 1980.</P>

<P><b>Post-Cold War Yugoslavia</b><br>
Tito provided Yugoslavia with stability. Through his strong leadership and the communist apparatus, Tito reduced the fears of ethnic domination felt historically by many of the Yugoslav people. The Serb minority in Croatia, the Muslims of Bosnia, the Croats of Serbia, all felt that Tito and the communist state protected them from ethnic oppression.</P>

<P>With the end of the Soviet Union and the inevitable collapse of the post-Tito communist Yugoslavia, the dormant ethnic tensions flared anew. Several republics feared a Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. In 1987, Slobodan Milosevic, a Serbian nationalist, became the Serbian Communist party leader. To the alarm of the other republics, Milosevic and his supporters revived the vision of a Greater Serbia. Towards this end, in early 1989, Serbia rescinded Kosovos autonomy (Kosovo is a province of Serbia) and sent in troops to suppress the protests of Kosovos population -- which is 85% Albanian.</P>

<P>In response to threatened Serbian expansion, Slovenia and Croatia elected non-communist governments in early 1990 and declared their independence on June 25, 1991. (Milosevic had been elected president of Serbia by this time.) Fighting immediately broke out as the federal army (controlled largely by Serbs) moved into Slovenia. By the end of July, federal troops had left Slovenia but fighting continued in Croatia between the Croatian forces and the federally-backed Serbs from the Serbian areas of Croatia.</P>

<P><b>Bosnia</b><br>
Bosnia is the only republic in the former Yugoslavia not dominated and defined by one ethnicity.  For much of its history, in fact, Bosnia's defining characteristic was its multi-ethnic population and its capital Sarajevos cosmopolitan nature. Before the war, most residents of Bosnia were Croats, Serbs or Muslims, although many would have simply identified themselves as Yugoslavian. In 1992, Muslims accounted for 44% of the population; Croats comprised 17%; and Serbs 31%. As a result of this ethnic mix, the pressures building up in many of the former republics of Yugoslavia affected Bosnian territory even more. With three ethnic-religious groups in one republic, tensions over governance ran especially high. As war raged in Croatia, many observers thought the real battleground might be Bosnia.</P>

<P>In late December 1991, Muslims and Croats in the Bosnian parliament asked the European Community to recognize Bosnia-Hercegovina as an independent state. Serbs insisted that they wanted to remain part of the federal Yugoslavia, and on January 9, 1992, Bosnian Serbs announced that they were forming their own state within the republic, called the Serbian Republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina. In February and March 1992, Bosnia held a referendum on the independence resolution passed by the Bosnian parliament. While Muslims and Croats voted overwhelmingly to approve the establishment of the Bosnia republic, most Serbs boycotted the voting and declared it invalid.</P>

<P>On April 6, 1992, following the recognition of Bosnia by the European Union, the Yugoslav Army (a Serb-controlled national army) and Bosnian Serb paramilitary groups began the siege of Sarajevo. The U.S. recognized Bosnia the next day. At the same time, Serbs declared their independence from Bosnia.</P>

<P>On June 16, 1992, the Bosnian government announced a formal military alliance with Croatia to fight the Serbian and Yugoslav forces. The Bosnian government formally declared a state of war on June 20, 1992. This government is now commonly referred to as the Muslim-led government of Bosnia.</P>

<P>Today, what used to be Yugoslavia consists of only two of the six republics which  were formerly part of the federation: Serbia proper and Montenegro. As for the other four former republics of the former Yugoslavia (Slovenia, Croatia,  Macedonia and Bosnia),  Slovenia , Croatia and Macedonia have been recognized as independent sovereign states. Bosnia has also been recognized as an independent sovereign state, however within Bosnia there are two entities: The Muslim-run Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the Serb -dominated Republika Srpska. </P>

<P>The Dayton Peace Agreement, which effectively ended the Balkan conflict,  formalized this structure. </P>

<P>Casualty estimates vary, but most observers report that about 200,000 are missing or killed since the war began.</P>

<h2>The Tribunal and the Law</h2>

<P>In the first international war crimes proceedings since the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials after World War II, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia  (ICTY) brings Bosnian-Serb Dusko Tadic to trial in The Hague, Netherlands. He is being tried for crimes which allegedly occurred in and near a Serb-controlled Bosnia prison camp in the spring and summer of 1992.</P>

<P>Pictures of emaciated and battered Muslim prisoners at the Omarska prison camp shocked the world. For many, the images of Omarska were the first proof of the alleged Serb policy of  ethnic cleansing in the Balkan conflict.</P>

<P>This tribunal was created by the U.N. Security Council in 1993. The pact to create the ICTY was the result of intense wrangling among the Security Council members. To the ICTYs critics, it is merely an ad-hoc creation; one designed to ease the conscience of the Western powers after they dithered during the Balkan war. To its supporters, the ICTY represents the most concrete step in the half-century since Nuremberg toward creating a permanent international criminal court to secure global enforcement of basic human rights. To garner the support of U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali, the resolution creating the ICTY  also empowers it to investigate and prosecute war crimes in Rwanda. Those proceedings are not expected to begin until mid-summer, at the earliest.</P>

<P>The ICTYs first indictment  was issued  November 11, 1994, of Dragan Nikolic, a Bosnian Serb who is alleged to have been the commander of  a small prison camp in eastern Bosnia. The second and third indictments were issued February 13, 1995. One indictment charged 19 Serbs with committing various atrocities at the Omarska camp. The second indictment issued that day charged Tadic and Goran Borovnica with crimes stemming from their alleged persecution and deportation of the civilian Muslim population as well as crimes committed at Omarska. In the first group of the February 13 indictees is Zeljko Meakic, the alleged commander at Omarska, who is charged with the gravest crime, genocide. Borovnica and Meakic remain at large.</P>

<P>To date, the ICTY has issued indictments against 57 men. The breakdown is as follows:  43 Bosnian Serbs (such as Tadic); three Serbs who are former Yugoslav Army officers; eight Bosnian Croats; and three Bosnian Muslims. Two, Zdravko Mucic, a Croat, and Tadic, are in custody in an ICTY-operated annex to a Dutch prison near the Tribunal. (The unit can house up to 24 suspects.) Another Croat, Tihomir Blaskic, is under house arrest at an undisclosed location in the Netherlands. Two more suspects are in Germany awaiting extradition. Another suspect, Serb general Djorde Djukic, was released from detention for humanitarian reasons because of his terminal illness. </P>

<P>In early May, the Bosnian government announced that it had detained two Muslim indictees, Hazim Delic and Esad Landzo, and would extradite them to the ICTY. Delic, a deputy to Mucic at the Celebic camp which detained Serbs, has been charged with four murders. Landzo, a guard at that camp, is charged with five murders.</P>

<P>Now the first defendant is on trial, accused of torturing and killing Muslim refugees in Omarska. A panel of three judges will decide Tadics guilt. The standard for guilt, like that of U.S. courts, is beyond a reasonable doubt. However, it only requires the votes of two (of the three) judges to convict Tadic. It will fall to observers around the world to decide whether those accused of heinous crimes can be tried fairly by an ad-hoc, temporary, international judicial body.</P>

<P><b>Legal Basis for the Tribunal</b><br>
The ICTY is not to be confused with the World Court, more formally known as the International Court of Justice. The World Court hears disputes between nations. By contrast, the ICTY prosecutes and tries individuals. Both happen to be in The Hague, but they are in two different buildings, with two different staffs and missions.</P>

<P>The U.N. Security Council established the ICTY under Chapter VII, Article 39, of the U.N. Charter which gives the body power to take measures that can help bring about peace:</P>

<P>The Security Council shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures should be taken...to maintain or restore international peace and security.</P>

<P>The charter suggests a few possible measures, such as economic blockades and peacekeeping missions, but the Secretary General urged the Security Council to interpret this provision more broadly. He asked the Security Council to create the tribunal as a method for restoring international peace.</P>

<P>Contained in this notion is one of the ICTYs principal challenges:  Is bringing justice to the events in the former Yugoslavia consistent or inconsistent with establishing the peace? The Tribunals chief prosecutor, Richard Goldstone, has long maintained that there can be no peace without justice. Others, including members of the U.S. Departments of State and Defense, believe that the ICTYs work could well jeopardize the fragile peace in the former Yugoslavia.</P>

<P><b>The Court's Structure</b><br>
The tribunal consists of three parts: the chambers, the prosecutor and the registry.</P>

<P>Chambers:  The chambers consist of 11 judges elected by the U.N. General Assembly from a list submitted by the Security Council. Three are from Asia, two from Europe, two from Africa, two from North America, and one each from Latin America and Australia. Two of the judges are female, including the chief presiding judge at the Tadic trial, former U.S. District Court Judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, who is also African-American. The president of the tribunal is Judge Antonio Cassesse of Italy.</P>

<P>Each of the two trial chambers has a three-judge panel. The remaining five judges serve as an appellate chamber. It only takes a majority vote by the three-judge panel to convict a defendant. There is no jury, and the standard of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt.</P>

<P>Office of the Prosecutor:  Headed by South African Richard Goldstone. The office has a staff of about 150, including 47 war crimes investigators, and is housed in the same building as the ICTY. Generally, prosecutors are loaned to the ICTY by their governments. Goldstone will leave his post in October to resume his seat on the Supreme Court of South Africa. His replacement is Louise Arbour, a judge on leave from the Ontario Court of Appeal.</P>

<P>Registry:  This office acts the repository for the tribunal. It is a combination of a court clerk's office and archive. The registry will become the final home for all evidence the tribunal uncovers.</P>

<P>Overall, the ICTY employs about 285 people from 37 different countries. The largest bloc of employees comes from the U.S. The 1996 budget is $40.8 million.</P>

<P><b>The Tribunal's Law, Procedures and Rules of Evidence</b><br>
The ICTY's procedure and evidence rules are a hybrid of the common law and civil law systems. In common law systems such as the U.S., jury trials are the norm, judges are largely neutral in proceedings, witnesses may be cross-examined, and complex rules govern admissibility of hearsay and other evidence. Civil law systems generally do not provide for juries, and judges play an active role in eliciting testimony directly from the witnesses. Those systems tend to favor allowing evidence before the court. This aspect of the ICTY will no doubt be a hot topic of discussion.</P>

<P>Personal Jurisdiction:  The tribunal is limited in its personal jurisdiction. It only can try cases from the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. In addition, since the judicial body is created as a specific method for bringing about a specific goal under the UN Charter dictates, the General Secretary recommended that the tribunal be temporary:  As an enforcement measure...the life span of the international tribunal would be linked to the restoration and maintenance of international peace and security in the territory of the former Yugoslavia... </P>

<P>Concurrent Jurisdiction with national courts:  The ICTY's jurisdiction is not exclusive. It has concurrent jurisdiction with national courts, although the Security Council asserts that it has primacy over national courts. This allows the ICTY to request that national courts discontinue their proceedings in deference to the ICTY. This is precisely how Dusko Tadic wound up being tried at The Hague instead of in a German national court.</P>

<P>There is a double jeopardy clause, but the ICTY can try someone for the same crime that has been heard by a national court if the ICTY determines that the alleged crime was classified as an ordinary act under national jurisdiction, or that the national court proceedings were not impartial or independent and were designed to shield the accused from the reach of international law.</P>

<P>No Trials In Absentia/Rule 61 Hearing: The ICTY cannot try defendants in absentia, but it does have a provision for dealing with indicted suspects who cannot be brought to trial. The provision is contained in Rule 61 of the tribunals procedures. A Rule 61 proceeding allows the prosecutor to present evidence publicly and call witnesses. The stated purpose is to reconfirm the indictment against the defendant and to permit the judges to issue an international arrest warrant. With this warrant, any nation can be asked to extradite the accused to the tribunal's custody.  If a nation chooses not to comply, Security Council sanctions can follow.</P>

<P>As a practical matter, Rule 61 serves two functions. First, it provides a documentary account of alleged acts. Many argue that creating a formal record of war crimes is almost as important as punishing an individual. Second, it does increase pressure on alleged war criminals. While many will be safe in the hills of Serbia or Bosnia, they will not be able to travel out of the country without fear of detention by a U.N. member.</P>

<P>Sentencing: The maximum punishment is life in prison. There is no death penalty. Once sentenced, defendants will serve out their terms in one of ten nations ( including Germany, Holland, Pakistan, the Scandinavian counties, and Muslim-controlled Bosnia) approved by the tribunal to house prisoners. Interestingly, once a criminal passes into the prison system of one of these countries, the ICTY no longer has jurisdiction. In other words, it is theoretically possible that the ICTY could sentence someone to 25 years in prison, but once extradited to a particular country, they could be released immediately.</P>

<P>Subject Matter Jurisdiction:  The tribunal is authorized by the Security Council to prosecute actions which fall in one of four areas.
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949
	<LI>Violations of law and customs of war
	<LI>Genocide
	<LI>Crimes against humanity
</UL></P>

<P>Tadic is charged with everything except genocide, which is the most serious accusation.</P>

<P>Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 is an amalgamation of the four Geneva Conventions approved in the wake of World War II. The Geneva Conventions generally set guidelines for the treatment of civilians in detention camps and military prisoners of war.</P>

<P>Violations of the law or customs of war is derived primarily from the Hague Convention of 1907 and the Nuremberg Charter. Essentially, this charge is a catchall for violating international standards of warfare. For example, the use of poisonous weapons falls under this category. Also included is the destruction of private property or cultural institutions not justified by military necessity.</P>

<P>Genocide is also derived from a post-World War II international treaty, the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The charge lays out a number of actions that may invite the charge, but makes the defining characteristic  intent. Thus, the definition of genocide is acts committed with the intent to destroy, whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group. Among the acts listed are killing, and measures intended to prevent births within a group.</P>

<P>Crimes against humanity include the commission of several acts, such as killing, imprisonment, and  torture, during armed conflict against a civilian population. The charge specifically says that the conflict can be either national or international in character. This is important because many Bosnian Serbs characterize the war in the Balkans as a civil war, not an international conflict. While this representation, if proven, can free a defendant of some charges (such as violations of the law or customs of war), crimes against humanity is not one of them.</P>

<P>Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic will be the first person tried by an international war crimes tribunal since Nuremberg. Court TV's Terry Moran recently interviewed Chief Prosecutor Richard Goldstone about the work of the International War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the upcoming trial and the prospects for a permanent  international criminal court. Here's an excerpt of the interview.</P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR>
Justice Goldstone, let me begin with a political question. Now that there is a precarious peace established in Bosnia, are the war crimes trials still important? Do they help or hinder the securing of that peace?</P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR>
I have no doubt that they can only help. It's very important to individualize guilt ... to indicate that, the atrocities that were committed; that were conceived of and executed by individuals and not by a nation or a people or a religious group; and, I can think of no better way of doing that than leaving evidence establishing or attempting to establish that these things were ordered by individuals. </P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR>
What do you say to the argument that they merely continued to rankle at the wounds that were opened in the civil war? </P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR>
Well the wounds are there ... And it's not a  question of opening wounds. They're open. And they're festering. And the only way to stop that festering is by truth and by justice and ... and it's the only way to start the healing process for victims and to avoid people demanding revenge and tacking them on to their own homes. </P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR>
So you don't see a conflict here between justice and peace? </P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR>
On the contrary. I think they're twins. </P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR>
How important is the (Dusko) Tadic trial to that goal? </P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR>
Well, I  don't want to comment on the Tadic trial and it's coming before the court really very shortly. But any trials before this tribunal are important. Obviously Tadic has assumed a greater importance because at the moment, he's still the only person we've indicted who's here. So, it's important in that sense. But obviously there are more important people than Mr. Tadic who have been indicted and first prize will be to get them into the court. </P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR>
What if you can't? Is Tadic enough? </P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR>
Well, I'm fairly optimistic that other people are going to be appearing in court. </P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR>
Can you talk a little bit about Tadic? About why this indictment was brought? Just the background of the indictment. </P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR>
Well, the background to the indictment just really starts with the commission of experts under the chairmanship of Professor (Cherif) Bassiouni. I did a very complete and very useful investigation into the events in Prijeador and the death camps at Omarska, Trnopolje, in particular ... before I was here ... when Graham Blewitt was the acting Deputy Prosecutor and ... and began to assemble investigate was they decided that that's where the first investigation should begin. And one of the people who was on the list of suspects, amongst a number of other people, was Mr. Tadic.</P>

<P>And after the investigation began, information was sent to the tribunal ... to this office by the German authorities to say that in fact Tadic should be arrested and have been identified. And having regard to the fact that he was an important suspect in an investigation that had already begun, the conclusion wasn't difficult to reach that this was a case that should be heard by the international tribunal and not left to the national courts of Germany. And that led to the furlough application and the transfer of Mr. Tadic by the German authorities to the tribunal. </P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR>
Talk a little about Omarska and Prijedor and why that was such an important place to begin in the indictments. </P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR>
Well, it was important in itself because of the scale and nature of the atrocities committed and the manner in which people were tortured and the manner in which people were murdered. And the way men and women were treated in those camps. So it was important on its own merits that, in addition, as I say,  the signposts were provided for us by the report of the commission of experts. </P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR>
What difference does it make that Tadic is not a soldier? That he wasn't  a regular soldier and that he's not a member of the army that was in charge of the situation? </P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR>
Well I think it's significant. It's not relevant to his culpability. We don't draw any distinction in that regard between military and political leaders. In terms of criminal laws, people who associate themselves with the commission of offenses, one doesn't have regard to what position they hold whether it was an official one, military or political. </P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR>
What's the law that you use to prosecute someone like Tadic or indict some other people involving this situation? What law do you rely on?</P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR>
We use the international humanitarian law which used to be called the Law of War. It's basically a body of law that's grown up over the last century in it's modern guise, aimed at protecting innocent non-belligerence in war. Innocent civilians; prisoners of war; also under our jurisdiction ... they can charge genocide in the crimes against humanity which don't require wars to be committed. This is really the reason why it's been renamed into National Humanitarian Law because it's really a coalition of aspects of a human rights law ... an aspect of genocide and crimes against humanity which are both an off-growth of Nazi atrocities of the second world war. And what preceded that which was the law of the Hague Convention ... the Geneva Convention ... which was more classically the law of war, but those are the laws which have been given to us by the security council as the basis of our jurisdiction.</P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR>
Is that jurisdiction inescapably political? </P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR>
No not at all ... I certainly don't see them as being political. They clearly  have a political fallout. And that's inevitable when one's dealing in the sort of context in which we're dealing where nations and people have been at war. But I suppose even in a national situation, many trials are political   in the sense that they have a political effect ... on ... the impeachment of a president is a legal proceeding. I don't think it's political in the sense that the decisions are not politically motivated. The decisions are not driven by political considerations. There's no political agenda. But it's obvious to a prosecutor in that situation that if you impeach the president, it's going to have tremendous political consequences, but that's no reason  why it shouldn't be done. And no reason in any way impugn the process of being political. </P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR>
So how much has the political fallout affected your work here?</P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR><BR>
Well, it hasn't affected any decisions we've taken. It hasn't affected who we investigate. It hasn't affected who we indict. It hasn't affected the timing of indictments. </P>

<P>We've done our work consciously and we have applied professional standards. We've tried to be as even-handed and unbiased and unprejudiced as it's possible to be. But obviously the perceptions are based on the order in which things happen. They started indicting Bosnian Serbs and we were accused of being anti-Serb. Had the first indictments been against Bosnian Muslims ... then I don't doubt we would have been accused of being anti-Muslim. When we started indicting Croats,  we in some quarters in Croatia and the Croatian parts of Bosnia, the accusation was made that we'd suddenly become anti-Croat. So, it's one of the facts of life that one has to live with, but I think one has to be steadfast, and one has to go ahead and do the work to the best of our ability and hope that sensible, reasonable people will judge us at the end and not at the beginning or the middle of our work.</P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR> <BR>
What would you say then to Bosnian Serbs or Croats or Muslims who see a compatriot brought here like Tadic and put on trial? When they say he won't get a fair trial here, how can you assure then that he would? </P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR><BR>
Well, the only way we can assure them is by seeing ... is by showing them and that's the important ground, I think, that you and the other media play. The only way to establish a fair trial is to have on. People won't accept words ... people want deeds and that's fair enough. </P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR>
Does he (Tadic) start at an automatic disadvantage though because he's the first defendant here? I mean, does that present special problems for the fairness of the Tadic trial? </P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR>
I wouldn't have thought so. I think,  if anything, the contrary. I think the first trial is  ... we're going to be feeling our way. The judges are going to be feeling their way. I think this is an unusual prosecutor's office in comparison to national prosecutor's offices and that we really are concerned to the fairness of the trial, certainly as much as the defense lawyers are. </P>

<P>We just cannot afford any of our proceedings to be judged by any of these people as being unfair. And we're going to be ... and that judgement is going to be made ... from many perspectives. Although it's an adversarial type of crime, it's fairness is going to be judged by nations and by lawyers and by commentators from countries who are not used to that form of proceedings. All the more reason that it's going to be very important to explain what we're doing and why are we doing it. And I have little doubt that the judges are going to feel equally obliged to be open and as forthcoming  as possible in the decisions that are made. </P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR>
How about resources. Is there an imbalance of resources between your office and the United Nations and an individual defendant in this system? </P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR><BR>
I certainly hope not. And we've certainly applied as much press as we can and successfully to ensure, for example, that Mr. Tadic's legal team is adequately resourced. Again, we can't afford unfairness to arise because of lack of resources. That would be a real unfairness. It's one of the justifiable criticisms of Nuremberg.  And it would be very, very  serious to the whole credibility of this process and to the future enforcement of international humanitarian law if there was a justified perception that accused people are being dealt with unfairly.</P>

<P>The whole  thrust of the rules which the judges so painstakingly wrote  for the tribunal has been predicated on equality. And the rules don't in any way favor the prosecutor. When it comes to discovery, disclosure of documents, disclosure of information, the whole thrust of the rules is to ensure  equal treatment of defense and prosecutor. </P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR> <BR>
You mentioned Nuremeberg. Another criticism of Nuremberg was the quality of defense counsel. Are you confident in the confidence of defense counsel in the tribunal here? </P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR><BR>
Yes, certainly in the cases that have so far come to the tribunal. There've been first-class lawyers appearing for the defense. And I don't want to talk about personalities. But it's something obviously we cannot control. And when I say we, I'm talking about the tribunal generally because to defend accused people ... defendants must be entitled to choose lawyers that they wish to choose. And if they choose the best, well they're going to get ... if they decide for any reason to choose less than the best, that's their privilege. That they shouldn't be saddled with second best because of lack of resources ... that's the least that the tribunal and the United Nations must ensure. </P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR>
The Nuremberg prosecutors relied primarily on documents to prove their cases. Your going to rely on witnesses. Compare that strategy a little bit? </P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR>
Well, it's not a choice. I think if prosecutors have guilt established in documents, above the signature of the defendants, obviously, it's more than any other prosecutor can do resist doing that. It means that trials can be bought quickly, can be short. On the other hand, the disadvantages ... there isn't the human element in it. You don't have witnesses, victims coming to court to the same extent and saying what happened and especially, you bear ... bear in mind that Nuremberg ... we're dealing with massive crimes involving many people. So there are advantages and disadvantages as in most important things in both those scenarios.</P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR>
Well, why is it important to have ... if you have the papers, which, as you point out, you don't, but why is it important to have the voice of the victims? </P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR>
Because people relate to individual stories. People don't relate to statistics, to generalizations. People can only relate and feel when they hear somebody that they can identify with telling what happened to them. That's something that any human being can relate to. And if you want to make an impression, if we're going to have any deterrent effect, that sort of impression that needs to be made.</P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR>
So one of the aims of the tribunal is to affect public opinion?</P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR>
That's the aim of any criminal justice system to ... to deter people from committing offenses. </P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR>
There may be another disadvantage that a defendant is at in a situation like the Tadic situation. His witnesses are still in Bosnia, for the most part. And the prosecution's witnesses available are because they're refugees. How about that situation? </P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR>
Well it shouldn't be a difficulty because one would imagine that the sort of witnesses who... somebody in the defendant's position would want to call will have the cooperation of local populations. In fact, it hasn't worked out quite that way in the case of Tadic because there's been a lack of cooperation or there has been, until recently, on the part of the Bosnian Serbs in giving his team access to witnesses, but I'm hopeful that that is being corrected. </P>

<P>But witnesses are witnesses and, it will be to the prosecutor's disadvantage in the end if, for reasons beyond the control of a defendant, witnesses aren't available. If witnesses aren't available and there are witnesses in existence who can't be brought,  any doubts that are created by the absence of the witness is going to make it more difficult for the prosecution to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. </P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR>
Is it conceivable that in the first war crimes prosecution since the end of the second world war ... there would be an acquittal? </P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR>
Of course, that's conceivable. If there's an acquittal, it'll be only for one reason and that is because the prosecution hasn't proved its case. And if it hasn't proved it's case, then there should be an acquittal and certainly that's the way it should go. </P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR>
You don't think there would be tremendous political pressure and the prestige of the international humanitarian law project to convict the first defendant? </P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR>
I don't look at it like that at all. I think that the purpose of this whole proceeding of the tribunal is to establish the truth. And there's a criminal standard which is guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and I wouldn't regard it as a failure at all if there was an acquittal. It would mean the system is working. </P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR>
How about the precedent that your work here and that the tribunal has or may have for the establishment of a permanent international criminal court. Is that a good idea?</P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR>
Well, there's clearly a direct relationship to the extent that this process is considered by the international community broadly speaking as being worth it. Being successful or partially successful ... to the extent that it may be considered a failure or a partial failure is obviously going to influence decisions that nations are going to take with regard to setting up a permanent court. </P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR>
There are five cameras in that courtroom. You touched on this a little earlier, and I wanted just to sound you out on it. Five cameras in the courtroom where the trials will take place. Why?</P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR>
Well I have no doubt that in any country and though this ... in an international court, the media is a partner in the whole criminal justice system. If people in the country are not told what their criminal courts are doing, then there's certain to be the deterrent aspect of criminal justice is going to fail. It's just not going to be there. </P>

<P>And in earlier days,  public trials were held ... executions were held in public. People who were found guilty were flogged in public. And the reasons for that being done ... punishments have to get round by word of mouth. </P>

<P>Today, fortunately, in my view for the criminal justice system, we have television; we have newspapers; we have radio. And people are told ... if the international community isn't told what we're doing here, and particularly if people in the countries where they are victims don't know what we're doing, there's no point in doing what we're doing. </P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR>
Let me ask about  your pending departure (in October) here. Do you feel that to some degree, your work is done? </P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR>
Well, clearly the work of the prosecutor won't be done as long as the tribunal continues to function. So the prosecutor's work isn't done. And I feel, and ... that may well be, talking myself into a position if you like, but I feel that the first phase of the tribunals for both Yugoslavia and Rwanda  is coming to an end and that's the start for the offices ... setting a strategy for the prosecutor's office ... getting the rules working and the beginning of the trials. </P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR>
Much of the media and a lot of people have focused on the Bosnian war crimes tribunal. The Rwandan war crimes tribunal is starting up as well. Compare the two in importance, in significance.</P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR><BR>
I think one must be careful not to be too myopic in a way. If one judges the question of interest from the press in most African countries, you will find that a lot more interest has been displayed in the Rwanda tribunal than in the tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.  But that's saying the obvious. Often the obvious is missed because of one's perspective. </P>

<P>Having said that, the Rwanda tribunal is certainly, in my view, as important as the tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. It's no less important for the victims, for international justice. I think it's particularly important in demonstrating that these sorts of atrocities can happen anywhere ... and on any continent, in any country, given the circumstances. I think it demonstrates in both areas and in others that haven't been covered unfortunately in my view by international tribunals.</P>

<P>The power of leadership and ... and how in my opinion, leadership is a tremendously powerful tool and can be used for good or evil. And what we're dealing with is are atrocities committed for political reasons by political leaders ... instigated by political leaders at various levels and the fact that one has a similar situation in Rwanda is I think a very important lesson for the whole of the international community. </P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR> <BR>
And do you think it possible that if these tribunals succeed, such a leader would actually think twice before launching a genocidal project? </P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR><BR>
I think the probabilities are overwhelming that that's true. No criminal conduct in any national state and it's no different in ... again, in the international community ... no criminal conduct can be stopped without a criminal justice system ... without good policing and importantly without law enforcement. If you don't have law enforcement, your crime rate's going to soar. </P>

<P>In any national state and in the international community, if people ... if people know ... people in leadership positions, particularly, know that there's a court there ... that there's an international prosecutor and that the international community is going to act as an international police force, in respect of international war crimes,  I just cannot believe that people aren't going to think twice as to consequences. Until now, they haven't had to. There's just been no enforcement mechanism at all.</P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR> <BR>
Have you ever thought you're tilting at windmills in a way to try to establish this?</P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR>
No, not at all because I think there's so many important aspects of this ... the fact that victims in Rwanda ... victims in the former Yugoslavia know that they haven't been ignored by the international community itself. </P>

<P>There's no forgetting quickly by the international community and brushing it under the rug. The educational aspect ... the fact that we're talking to each other about international war crimes would not remotely have happened without these tribunals being set up. The fact that the law of war in international humanitarian law is being taught and discussed at seminars and in classrooms ... to universities and probably in the majority of the countries of the world, things that wouldn't have happened but for these tribunals being set up. The fact that the whole debate on a permanent court is being taken up and is being taken more seriously and none of these things would have happened without this really brave action by the Security Council in setting up the two tribunals.</P>

<P><B>Question</B><BR>
All right. Justice Goldstone thank you.</P>

<P><B>Justice Goldstone</B><BR>
Pleasure.</P>

<H2>The Real Trial Of The Century</H2>

<P>William W. Horne<BR>
<I>The American Lawyer</I></P>

<P>Graham Blewitt--with 29 years' experience as a federal prosecutor in 
Australia--is not given to exaggeration or emotional outbursts. As 
chief of an Australian Nazi war crimes investigations unit from 1989 
to 1994, Blewitt, 48, thought he knew all there was to know about 
genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. When he joined 
the new International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in 
The Hague, the Netherlands, in early 1994 as its deputy prosecutor, he 
thought it would just be more of the same. It wasn't. </P>

<P>"I still shake my head when I come across these stories of these 
seemingly normal people murdering their neighbors," says Blewitt in 
an uncharacteristically choked-up voice. "I can't imagine sitting there 
at a barbecue drinking a beer or two with your neighbor one day and 
then the next day you're murdering or treating that person in the worst 
way." </P>

<P>The fury of the neighbor-on-neighbor violence-perpetrated largely by 
the Bosnian Serbs against Muslims as part of a campaign of "ethnic 
cleansing"--is one of the mysteries of the Bosnian conflict for 
international spectators. Even the Nazis, Blewitt points out, killed 
their victims in a cold, efficient manner; rape and torture were the 
exception, not the rule: "But the atrocities here, this is blood lust." </P>

<P>This blood lust is not just about territory; it's about centuries-old 
hatred that has boiled over into a cycle of atrocity and revenge. What 
happened to the European Jews 50 years ago at the hands of the Nazis 
is happening to Bosnian Muslims at the hands of the Serbs right now. </P>

<P>For three-and-a-half years, Serbs have thumbed their noses at 
international attempts to resolve this war on their Muslim neighbors. 
The world powers have wrung their hands, their peacemaking and 
diplomatic efforts in the former Yugoslavia not only failing to end 
conventional war-making--armed soldiers killing armed soldiers on a 
battlefield-but failing also to deter the commission of war crimes. The 
Serbs, by far the biggest perpetrators, have not been forced to answer 
for these crimes, and so they have not. </P>

<P>But in November--after two-and-a-half years of battling its United 
Nations paymaster for funding and overcoming the nightmarish 
logistics of collecting evidence in a war zone--the tribunal is scheduled 
to try its first defendant, Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic, in front of three 
judges and a worldwide television audience. 1 </P>

<P>It may be the most important criminal trial in this century. More 
important than the treason trials of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg and of 
East German spymaster Markus Wolf. More important than the 
Watergate trials, the Rodney King case, the Chicago Seven trial, and, 
yes, even O.J. </P>

<P>Not because the alleged crimes--132 counts related to rape, murder, 
and torture--are necessarily worse than those committed by the 
thousands of war criminals who now range freely in Tito's former 
domain. And not just because the case will forge new international 
legal precedents. </P>

<P>Tadic's trial will likely be the most significant criminal trial in this 
century because it is a chance, finally, for the world to redeem the 
international rule of law and prove it learned something from the 
horrors of World War II. Unlike Nuremberg, the Tadic trial will 
unfold in the middle of the war for the former Yugoslavia. While 
Nuremberg came too late to help the Nazis' victims, the Tadic trial and 
those that follow at least have a chance of deterring Serbs and others 
from continuing to commit war crimes. </P>

<P>Most of us have grown accustomed to, even bored by, that far-off 
conflict between Serbs and Bosnian Muslims and Croats. The daily 
tales of atrocities are just that--too daily, too regular to sink in. Sure, 
we may flinch when faced with a photograph of an injured child or a 
corpse. Yet we turn the page or change channels, and the images 
vanish. That apathy--that conclusion that war, murder, rape, even 
genocide are out of our control--is why the Tadic trial is so important. </P>

<P>The Tadic trial itself will not bring peace. That must ultimately come 
from the participants. But no peace will last unless the victims see that 
some form of justice is meted out to the perpetrators. And if the 
prosecutors are even half right, Dusko Tadic (pronounced DOO-shko 
TAH-ditch) is a perpetrator of the worst sort. </P>

<P>Tadic's alleged crimes make even a seasoned war crimes prosecutor 
like Graham Blewitt blanch. Tadic, a 39-year-old former caf owner in 
the Prijedor opstina, or district, in northeastern Bosnia is charged with 
committing war crimes and crimes against humanity for the part that 
prosecutors say he played in 13 deaths, a rape, and several torture 
incidents in Bosnia and Herzegovina in May through August 1992. 
Among his more gruesome alleged exploits: forcing one prisoner to 
bite off the testicle of another, who subsequently died as a result. </P>

<P>Most of the allegations against Tadic--including the castration charge-
-relate to his activities at the now-notorious Omarska concentration 
camp, where hundreds if not thousands of the Bosnian Serbs' 
prisoners--nearly all Bosnian Muslims, civilians and soldiers, men and 
women--were horribly abused and often killed by their captors. What 
makes Tadic's crimes even more heinous--if true--is that he was 
neither a commander nor a guard at the camp; he was one of what 
prosecutors at the war crimes tribunal call "camp visitors," outsiders 
who only visited the camps to participate in and direct the sadistic 
treatment of the prisoners--many of them their former neighbors. </P>

<P>Tadic has pled not guilty and claims he was not at the camps when the 
crimes were committed. In November, if everything goes as scheduled, 
the world will find out if he's telling the truth. </P>

<P>And if all goes as planned, those tuning in to the trial will see well-
prepared advocates from both sides before experienced judges in a 
gleaming new courtroom--the epitome of smooth-running 
international justice. </P>

<P>But the road to Tadic has been a rocky one. As you will read, for those 
at the tribunal who have made the journey, who have made personal 
and professional sacrifices in an attempt to bring the rule of law back 
to Bosnia, Tadic represents the end of a tortuous two-and-a-half-year 
odyssey. "There's always been a great sense of urgency, [a sense] that 
the tribunal's future depended on getting results," says Blewitt. </P>

<P>END-RUNNING THE U.N.<BR>
The international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is in a 
four-story sand-colored building in a quiet suburb of The Hague. A 
yellow brick drive sweeps past a reflecting pool dotted with modern 
sculpture, its surface mirroring the crescent-shaped tribunal building. 
Only a tiny sign confirms the tribunal's existence. From the outside, 
little activity is apparent on a midsummer's day. </P>

<P>Inside, it's a different story. Nine teams, each with four to seven 
experienced lawyers and investigators, are working furiously to put 
together cases and indictments. In the course of five days of interviews 
at the tribunal in late June, chief prosecutor Richard Goldstone and his 
deputy, Blewitt, are everywhere, poking their heads into offices, 
buttonholing people in the hallways, rushing off to strategy sessions. </P>

<P>With 21 indictments issued in February and March and the Tadic trial 
looming, the tribunal has suddenly become a factor in the Bosnian 
quagmire. Will the prosecutors' actions affect the peace process? Are 
they prolonging the war or shortening it? </P>

<P>The war crimes prosecutors don't care about those issues. In late July 
they raised the stakes even higher by indicting Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic and his army commander, General Ratko Mladic, 
for genocide and crimes against humanity "arising from atrocities 
perpetrated against the civilian population throughout Bosnia-
Herzegovina, for the sniping campaign against civilians in Sarajevo, 
and for the taking of U.N. peacekeepers as hostages and their use as 
human shields," according to a tribunal press release. They also 
indicted Croatian Serb leader Milan Martic for ordering the shelling of 
Croatia's capital, Zagreb; 15 guards, camp commanders, and visitors 
to the Luka and Keraterm concentration camps; and six local Serb 
politicians and paramilitary leaders for directing the ethnic cleansing 
of a town called Bosanski Samac. </P>

<P>The tribunal's spate of pretrial proceedings, indictments, and deferral 
proceedings appear to be the result of a coordinated, well-funded effort 
by the U.N. and the tribunal staff. The prosecutor is chasing, catching, 
and trying the bad guys, just as prosecutors do the world over. </P>

<P>But these recent highlights cannot obscure the tribunal's painful road 
to maturity. After all, the crimes with which Dusko Tadic is charged 
were allegedly committed in the spring and summer of 1992, three-
and-a-half years ago. The U.N. and international community were well 
aware from press reports that summer that war crimes were being 
committed in the Bosnian conflict and that death camps had 
reappeared in Europe for the first time since 1945. From the 
beginning, however, the international response was anemic; it took a 
handful of determined people to push toward a fully operational 
international war crimes tribunal. </P>

<P>The first was law professor Cherif Bassiouni of Chicago's DePaul 
University. In October 1992 the U.N. Security Council established a 
five-member commission of experts to collect evidence of alleged 
atrocities in the former Yugoslavia. It was a meager start: The U.N. 
covered only the salary of the chairman and five staff members and the 
expense of traveling to the former Yugoslavia. The U.N. did not cover 
the enormous cost of conducting on-site investigations, and collecting 
and recording that evidence in a central database. </P>

<P>But it was a start, and Bassiouni, an international law expert who was 
a member of and later chaired the U.N. commission, worked tirelessly 
to collect evidence while it was fresh, recruiting scores of volunteers 
and experts lent to the commission by the governments of such 
countries as Canada, Norway, and the Netherlands, and private groups 
like Physicians for Human Rights. The governments of Austria, 
Germany, and Sweden interviewed dozens of refugees in those 
countries on behalf of the commission, and the commission itself 
conducted 35 field investigations. </P>

<P>Bassiouni says that from the beginning it was obvious to him that 
certain powerful member states of the U.N.--such as Great Britain and 
France--had no appetite to pursue war criminals. "But I found a way to 
end-run the pattern of delay the U.N. was engaging in," he says. When 
the U.N. declined his request to set up a database collection operation 
in Geneva, he set one up right at his own university in Chicago. When 
funding dried up, he drummed up more by convincing certain 
countries to kick in to a voluntary trust fund he says the U.N. set up at 
his behest. </P>

<P>Even at this early stage, the alleged deeds of Dusko Tadic did not 
escape the attention of the war crimes investigators. On October 18, 
1992, Newsday published a story by Roy Gutman--one in a series that 
won a 1992 Pulitzer Prize--on the notorious Omarska death camp. </P>

<P>Among the dozens of survivors' stories Gutman recounted was one 
involving the castration of a man named Emir Karabasic. Prosecutors 
would later determine that the victim's name was Harambasic, but the 
facts alleged were the same. According to Tadic's February 1995 
indictment, "The group of Serbs, including [Dusko] Tadic, severely 
beat the prisoners with various objects and kicked them on their heads 
and bodies. After Fikret Harambasic was beaten, two other prisoners, 
"G" and "H," were called out. A member of the group ordered "G" and 
"H" to . . . sexually mutilate Fikret Harambasic. "H" covered Fikret 
Harambasic's mouth to silence his screams and "G" bit off one of 
Fikret Harambasic's testicles. . . . Harambasic died from the attack." </P>

<P>Press reports were an important source of information for the 
commission. That castration-murder described in Newsday was 
entered into Bassiouni's growing database-an incident that would later 
be cross-referenced to dozens of others involving Tadic, a caf owner 
and karate teacher turned alleged camp terrorist. </P>

<P>Tadic had become an important blip on the embryonic tribunal's radar 
screen. </P>

<P>ELEVEN JUDGES, NO PROSECUTOR<BR>
The Security Council officially established a war crimes tribunal for 
the former Yugoslavia May 25, 1993, shortly after the U.N. had 
received the experts commission's first interim report. It took another 
four months for 11 judges to be confirmed by the U.N.: three from 
Asia, two from Europe, two from Africa, two from North America-
including one of only two women on the panel, former Houston federal 
district judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, who will also be hearing the 
Tadic case--and one each from Latin America and Australia. </P>

<P>Italy's Antonio Cassese was elected by his fellow judges as the 
tribunal's president, or chief judge. He administers the chambers, 
including assignment of judges to cases, and is himself the head of the 
five-judge appeals chamber. (There are two trial chambers and one 
appeals chamber at the tribunal.) </P>

<P>Interviewed in his football field-sized office at the tribunal, Cassese, 
58, is a small, expressive man who takes his job seriously. Should he 
lapse into lightheartedness, he has only to glance up at his walls; four 
large color photos depict the dead and walking wounded in the former 
Yugloslavia, and a fifth is of wasted, hollow-cheeked inmates at 
Omarska. But don't all these photos of Muslim victims give the 
appearance of anti-Serb bias? "No, no, no," he exclaims, his hands 
chopping the air for emphasis. "It doesn't matter to me what side of the 
conflict they are on. These are just to remind me of the job we have to 
do here." </P>

<P>When he arrived at The Hague to be inducted as a judge in November 
1993, Cassese, an international law professor at the University of 
Florence who has written extensively on war crimes, was stunned by 
what he found. "There was zero!" he exclaims. "Nothing! We had four 
secretaries, a few computers, and the U.N. had rented a meeting room 
and three small offices in the Peace Palace. The rent was paid for two 
weeks." </P>

<P>Eager to fulfill his mandate, Cassese convened the first working 
session of the tribunal shortly after the judges' induction ceremony. He 
has apparently never let up. "Some of us were saying, 'Let's go slow,' " 
recalls U.S. tribunal judge McDonald. "But to be frank, [Cassese] 
wanted us to accomplish something quickly." </P>

<P>The criminal procedure rules were hashed out in two plenary sessions 
that resulted in a first draft in February 1994. (By contrast, it took a 
committee of American judges and law professors four years to draft 
the federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in the early 1940s.) Since 
most of the judges and the acting prosecutor were from common law 
countries, the code is skewed toward that adversarial model, but it has 
clearly defined elements from civil jurisdictions as well, such as 
allowing judges to call and question witnesses of their own accord. </P>

<P>Next, unperturbed by what had already become a fiscal tug of war with 
his U.N. masters, Cassese found bigger, more expensive space to house 
the tribunal-its prosecution office, chambers, and a courtroom. He 
commissioned construction of a custom-designed, state-of-the-art 
courtroom. An expert on detention, Cassese toured several prisons to 
determine the most humane, sophisticated design, then oversaw the 
construction of a modern 24-cell detention center for the tribunal's 
accused that was built in the center of a Dutch prison in The Hague, 
where the Dutch prison's former courtyard once was. Prisoners have 
their own TV, radio, and shower, but security is extremely tight. 
Visitors, for example, must go through first the Dutch prison's 
checkpoints and then the U.N.'s before reaching the cells housing 
suspected war criminals. By May 1994 the court had also issued 
comprehensive rules governing the detention of accused war criminals 
and the assignment of defense counsel. </P>

<P>"We had to invent and take a fresh approach to everything," Cassese 
recalls. </P>

<P>Despite Cassese's forceful leadership, a key component of the tribunal 
was still missing: a chief prosecutor. The Venezuelan who had been 
appointed in October 1993, Ramn Escobar-Salom, quit in February 
1994 to take a position as minister of interior relations with his 
government-without having done any significant work as prosecutor. 
"I thought, 'You let us down,' " declares Cassese. "We asked him to at 
least recruit a deputy before he left." </P>

<P>WE HAVE A POPE!<BR>
Fortunately, a thousand miles away, Graham Blewitt was casting about 
for a new position. After 24 years as a prosecutor, Blewitt had spent 
the last five as the director of the Nazi war crimes investigation unit of 
the Australian equivalent of the FBI, known as the National Crime 
Authority. (The Australian government had disbanded that unit after 
their third prosecution wound down in late 1993.) </P>

<P>Blewitt remembers the chill he felt upon reading of Serbian "ethnic 
cleansing" in 1992. That precise term had been used by the Nazi-
backed Croats in their vicious campaign against Serbs during World 
War II; Blewitt's war crimes investigations required him to travel to 
the former Yugoslavia to interview witnesses and to the Ukraine to 
exhume graves. Now the witnesses were young and the graves fresh. 
He sent a query letter to the U.N. in early 1994, interviewed with 
Escobar, and was offered the job of acting deputy prosecutor a few 
days after he returned to Australia. </P>

<P>When Blewitt joined the tribunal in late February 1994, "there were 
hundreds of applications from people volunteering their services," he 
says. To his chagrin, however, while there were many lawyers eager to 
join the tribunal as either prosecutors or investigators, few veteran 
investigators had applied, and they were crucial to the next stage of the 
tribunal's work. The massive final report of Professor Bassiouni's 
commission of experts was due to arrive in late April, including 
68,000 pages of documentary evidence and some 300 hours of video 
evidence. Using that report as a "blueprint," explains Blewitt, 
investigators could begin to develop the tribunal's cases. </P>

<P>Blewitt says he started calling potential investigators throughout the 
world and over the next two months convinced a handful to come. Fate 
intervened at that point: The United States lent 22 lawyers, 
prosecutors, FBI agents, and other experts on its payroll directly to the 
tribunal for as long as they were needed. "It's worth saying that 
without that contribution at that time we wouldn't have started to 
investigate as soon as we did," says Blewitt. </P>

<P>Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council continued its search for a big-
name prosecutor who could lead the tribunal toward indictments and 
trials. It was a ridiculous effort that highlighted the council's inability 
to act on crucial global issues. According to Professor Bassiouni--who 
was nominated by U.N. secretary general Boutros Boutros-Ghali in 
August 1993 but failed to get enough votes in the Security Council--it 
was individual member states of the council that caused the delay in 
appointing a prosecutor. </P>

<P>The council considered both formally and informally half a dozen 
candidates for the office between August 1993 and the summer of 
1994. These included a high-ranking Scottish prosecutor, the attorney 
general of Kenya, a Canadian war crimes prosecutor, a former attorney 
general of India, a Swiss vice-president of the European Commission 
on Human Rights, and a high court judge from Mauritius. Some didn't 
want the headache of the job; others were nixed by Security Council 
members. (A single member could veto any candidate.) Covington & 
Burling partner Charles Ruff, a former U.S. attorney, was pushed by 
the U.S. delegation and the White House, says Bassiouni. But Russia 
reminded the U.S. of an informal agreement among Security Council 
members not to nominate candidates from any permanent members of 
the council, who were deeply involved in the peace negotiations and 
peacekeeping activities in the former Yugoslavia. Ruff's name was 
withdrawn. (Ruff confirms he was a candidate but says he does not 
know why his name was withdrawn; State Department legal adviser 
Conrad Harper declines to comment on the appointment process. A 
senior U.N. official concedes that there is "no question that time was 
lost," but attributes the delay to political wrangling within the Security 
Council and an unfortunate choice in Escobar.) </P>

<P>Cassese says he grew desperate; the rules of procedure specified that 
only the prosecutor was authorized to conduct investigations and file 
indictments. "I was so dejected I said, `Why don't we resign en masse 
to show the public we cannot go on?' " says Cassese. Instead, he took 
matters into his own hands. Throughout June he called lawyers and 
judges around the world that he knew from his years on international 
commissions and human rights organizations, soliciting candidates. 
One name popped up more than once: South African judge Richard 
Goldstone, darling of the antiapartheid forces. </P>

<P>Goldstone had just completed his work as chair of the Goldstone 
Commission, a massive, controversial three-year probe into the causes 
of the South African political violence that had left scores of black 
South Africans dead or wounded since 1991. On July 4 Cassese 
informally approached Goldstone. Would he take on the job as the 
tribunal's chief prosecutor? </P>

<P>Goldstone says he was interested but was concerned about leaving 
South Africa at "an exciting and important time in its history." When 
he first consulted with the new minister of justice, the difficulty of his 
decision was compounded: He was told that he was one of four judges 
that soon would be unanimously appointed to South Africa's new 11-
judge Constitutional Court. By taking the two-year stint as prosecutor, 
Goldstone would lose the opportunity to participate in seminal cases in 
South African constitutional history. "It'd be like missing a chance to 
write Marbury v. Madison," says Vernon Grigg III, Goldstone's former 
clerk, now at San Francisco's Keker & Van Nest. </P>

<P>Mandela, however, had a solution: Goldstone would do both. 
"President Mandela thought it was important for South Africa to 
accept the first prominent international job offered to a South African 
since our readmission to the world," recounts Goldstone. In fact, 
George Bizos, Mandela's personal lawyer, says Mandela felt indebted 
to the U.N. for its role in obtaining his release from prison. So it was 
set: Goldstone would go to the tribunal and Mandela, by pushing 
through a constitutional amendment, would hold open Goldstone's 
spot on the high court until his return. (The new court's judges are 
appointed to seven-year terms; Goldstone will return to serve out the 
five years remaining in his term.) </P>

<P>For two days, says Cassese, he tapped his fingers and paced, waiting 
for an answer. On July 6 he had it: Goldstone accepted. </P>

<P>An ebullient Cassese rushed out faxes to the tribunal judges with a 
traditional message from the Vatican heralding papal succession: 
"Habemus papum! " </P>

<P>We have a pope! </P>

<P>THE POPE ARRIVES<BR>
Richard Goldstone, 56, can be a charming, thought-provoking 
conversationalist and host. He is well-traveled, reads prodigiously--
favoring thick biographies of politicians, lawyers, and civil rights 
leaders--frequently dines out (as in South Africa, with a squad of 
bodyguards poised nearby), and is a world-class wine connoisseur. But 
when it comes to his work, Goldstone, a short, stern-faced man with a 
piercing gaze and an unflappable demeanor, is all business. </P>

<P>In fact, Goldstone's straightforward style is probably the perfect 
counterbalance to that of more emotional members of the tribunal, 
notably Cassese. Upon arriving in The Hague in mid-August of 1994, 
Goldstone recognized that his was a big-picture diplomatic role and 
that the hands-on prosecution work could be pushed down to 
experienced prosecutors and investigators like Blewitt--at least for the 
time being. </P>

<P>"I felt that my first goal was to turn around the credibility crisis," 
recounts Goldstone. "The international media had become very 
antagonistic because of the delays in getting going. They had 
determined there was some sort of conspiracy, that the U.N. set up the 
tribunal only as a conscience salver, as a bargaining chip in the peace 
process." </P>

<P>Goldstone says he gave two dozen interviews and press conferences 
during his first month at the tribunal. He got out the message that the 
tribunal was in business and was not conspiring to dawdle while the 
war criminals got away with murder. It was a comfortable role; after 
all, Goldstone had made daily appearances on South African TV while 
he chaired the eponymous commission that routed out the causes of 
South African violence and paved the way for the 1994 elections there. </P>

<P>Still, the media and cynics like Cherif Bassiouni-who had had his 
fingers burned by the U.N.'s seeming apathy to his work on the experts 
commission-quickly put Goldstone's patience to the test. </P>

<P>On October 2, six weeks after he joined the tribunal, CBS television 
newsmagazine 60 Minutes ran an unflattering story about the tribunal 
called "An Exercise in Hypocrisy." While the tribunal and Goldstone 
were not faulted for the court's failure to indict, much less try, any war 
criminal to date, Professor Bassiouni, former secretary of State 
Lawrence Eagleburger, and John Fox, a former State Department 
official who had been monitoring the former Yugoslavia, lambasted 
the "hopelessly complex U.N. bureaucracy . . . intent on throttling the 
tribunal's every effort," in the words of Mike Wallace. </P>

<P>Goldstone, recognizing that good press required tangible results, 
began his own push for progress. The tribunal was still operating on a 
quarterly budget; every three months the tribunal had to reapply to its 
U.N. paymaster for the next quarter. "Imagine how hard it is to attract 
good people with that kind of job security," says Blewitt. And new 
hires were subjected to the U.N.'s time-consuming, paper-intensive 
vetting process. </P>

<P>Goldstone made numerous calls and two trips to New York in the fall 
of 1994, ingratiating himself with the various U.N. policy wonks who 
control funding, working the maze of power and pettiness. He asserts 
now that he discovered that the U.N. had not been consciously tugging 
at the new court's purse strings. "It took a while to sort out," he says, 
"but it was not a question of the U.N.'s ill will. They simply had great 
difficulty fitting a judicial body into the U.N. structure." A senior U.N. 
official concurs with Goldstone's assessment, adding that the general 
assembly has made "a real effort" to accommodate the tribunal's 
financial needs: "We won't pretend this was all done impeccably, but 
this is the first time anything like this has been done." </P>

<P>Still, it wasn't a pleasant task. "Dealing with [the U.N.'s] bureaucratic 
rules was extremely frustrating and time-wasting," Goldstone recalls. </P>

<P>But Goldstone managed to convince the U.N. funding committee to 
give his new hires guaranteed one-year contracts, allowing him nearly 
to double the tribunal from 45 to 80 employees by the end of 1994, and 
to grow to its current size of some 250. (In 1994 the tribunal's budget 
was $11 million. For the first half of 1995 the tribunal requested and 
received quarterly installments of an unapproved $28 million annual 
budget. That budget was finally approved on July 18.) </P>

<P>Goldstone also played diplomat, forging critical relationships with the 
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International 
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and the U.N. Protection Force in 
Bosnia (UNPROFOR). The UNHCR and ICRC monitor the shifting 
Muslim and Serb populations in the wake of the Serbs' ethnic 
cleansing campaigns and interview victims and witnesses to alleged 
atrocities. UNPROFOR, among other things, maintains reports on the 
shelling of civilian targets, conducts its own investigations of alleged 
war crimes, and provides protection and access to the tribunal's 
investigators when they conduct investigations in the former 
Yugoslavia. "Without our own police force we must convince others to 
perform forensics tests, etc., for us," says tribunal investigator J.J. Du 
Toit, a prosecutor who worked for the Goldstone Commission before 
joining the tribunal. "[Goldstone] opened the doors to get that 
information back to the tribunal." </P>

<P>All this shuttle diplomacy to New York, London, and Geneva took 
Goldstone away from the tribunal during his first two months on the 
job. But it was worth the payoff. "He ensured the tribunal's survival," 
says senior prosecuting trial attorney Grant Niemann, the veteran 
Australian prosecutor who will prosecute Tadic. </P>

<P>With money and staffing concerns allayed, Goldstone turned next to 
the tribunal's mandate, prosecuting war criminals. With no potential 
defendants in custody, Goldstone considered the next best possibility, 
an indictment. </P>

<P>NO NUREMBERG<BR>
As with everything having to do with an international tribunal that 
attempts to meld people from 29 different cultures into a single 
cohesive unit, putting together a simple indictment can take ages. The 
lawyers are dealing with unfamiliar crimes committed in a foreign 
country, interpreting a brand-new code of evidence, working with 
unfamiliar people. Their primary targets--the Bosnian Serbs--are the 
victors rather than the losers of this conflict so far. And the Serbs, 
unlike the meticulous Germans in the last world war, have kept no 
detailed accounts of their deeds. So suspects and evidence are hard to 
come by. "There's no question that this is no Nuremberg," concedes 
senior prosecuting trial attorney Minna Schrag. </P>

<P>When Goldstone started looking for someone to indict in the fall of 
1994, the office's best evidence concerned Serbian ethnic cleansing 
activities in the Prijedor district in northeastern Bosnia, where the 
Keraterm, Trnopolje, and Omarska concentration camps were located. 
The commission of experts report had concentrated on that region, 
concluding that the prewar population of some 53,000 non-Serbs in 
that region had been reduced to approximately 2,500 by May 1994 
through forcible eviction. But was there enough evidence to indict? It 
depended on whom you asked. </P>

<P>Tribunal investigator Jean-Pierre Getti, a well-known French 
investigating judge who conducted the war crimes investigation of 
former Nazi collaborator Paul Touvier, recalls that a healthy debate 
broke out at the tribunal over the standard for indicting. </P>

<P>The civil law view, Getti explains through an interpreter, is to require 
"serious and corroborated" evidence, while the common law 
interpretation is stricter: evidence sufficient to establish a "prima 
facie" case. </P>

<P>The prosecutors went with the more conservative common law 
interpretation, delaying the first three indictments somewhat, Getti 
says. For the last five indictments, says Getti, the prosecutors settled 
on a standard that falls somewhere between the two interpretations. </P>

<P>The culture clash over evidentiary standards was hardly the first 
dispute among the tribunal's disparate, polyglot assemblage of lawyers, 
investigators, and judges. (French and English are the official 
languages of the tribunal; English is the de facto working language.) 
Even the smallest details continue to be debated--and slow the pace of 
the proceedings. "What form should the interviews [of witnesses] 
take?" queries prosecutor Minna Schrag, now on leave from New 
York's Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn, where she is a litigation 
partner [In the News, April]. "What should an indictment look like? 
None of the indictments we've issued has looked the same, and the 
next indictment won't look like any of the previous indictments." </P>

<P>Another member of the tribunal defends its deliberative style. Patricia 
Viseur Sellers, a former Philadelphia public defender, is the tribunal's 
legal adviser on gender-related crimes, namely rape. (Rape has long 
been categorized as a war crime or crime against humanity under the 
Geneva Conventions. But the Tadic trial will be one of the first times, 
say prosecutors, that rape, used as a systematic tool of terror and 
intimidation against a civilian population, will be prosecuted as a war 
crime.) Sellers asserts that prosecutors simply want to do things right 
the first time around because they "know every step might be 
historically important, that they are on a world stage." </P>

<P>Nonetheless, through a process of trial and error, the kinks--for the 
most part--have been eliminated from the tribunal's system of 
investigations and indictment, which now works something like this: 
The nine investigation teams assemble proof of the underlying crimes-
evidence that includes depositions, reports by military observers, press 
reports, photographs, maps, charts, autopsy reports, etc. Each team has 
a data analyst to organize and ensure the chain of custody of evidence. 
The teams or portions of the teams may travel to the former 
Yugoslavia and other countries to depose witnesses and victims, and 
collect other evidence both as to the alleged crimes and on any 
suspects that have emerged. (In 1994 20 three-member teams 
conducted field investigations; 45 teams are expected to conduct such 
investigations this year, each for an average of two weeks per month.) </P>

<P>The legal adviser assigned to each group works with one of the three 
senior prosecuting trial attorneys to determine under which article of 
the tribunal's authorizing each alleged crime falls. (Those trial 
attorneys, Australian Grant Niemann, American Minna Schrag, and 
Swede Eric Ostberg, will lead the prosecution teams at trial.) A rape, 
for example, may be a crime against humanity (Article 5) and a war 
crime (Article 3). An indictment is then crafted by those attorneys that 
ties the acts alleged to the charge under the statute. Commander 
William Fenrick, a Canadian expert on the laws of war, is often 
consulted at that stage about the finer points of fitting the alleged acts 
into a military context. Those preliminary indictments and the offers 
of proof--often hundreds of pages of documents and testimony--are 
then reviewed by deputy prosecutor Blewitt, who in turn forwards it to 
chief prosecutor Goldstone for final approval. </P>

<P>While the system sounds simple, even the smallest detail takes far 
more time and resources than would be necessary, for example, in a 
federal criminal investigation in the United States. Consider a simple 
victim or witness statement, as described by American prosecutor 
Schrag. First investigators have to locate a witness to a particular 
crime. Many witnesses are in refugee camps or otherwise transient and 
difficult to reach. Once the witness is contacted, he or she has to agree 
to speak against the perpetrator. Many with families in occupied areas 
fear retaliation and will not testify; others, particularly victims, are too 
scarred by their experiences to do so. "These are badly damaged 
people," says Tadic prosecutor Niemann. </P>

<P>If they do agree to speak, an interpreter and two investigators must 
travel from the tribunal to wherever in Europe the witness is located. 
As one investigator questions a witness, the interpreter translates the 
Serbo-Croat into English and vice versa while another investigator 
takes notes. Those notes are later typed up into a statement in English 
that is then read back to the witness in Serbo-Croat for oral approval. 
The witness makes adjustments, and then the final statement, in 
English, is signed by the witness. </P>

<P>In spite of these logistical obstacles, the tribunal rumbled along 
through the fall of 1994 and finally, on November 7, Goldstone issued 
his first indictment, of Susica camp commander Dragan Nikolic. </P>

<P>POTEMKIN TRIBUNAL?<BR>
Nikolic was probably not the best choice for the first indictment. He 
had some command responsibility for a small group of guards, and 
had allegedly participated in multiple murders and torture. But he 
could not be charged with genocide, the crime of crimes, and was not 
accused of rape--a little prosecuted international war crime that 
prosecutors hoped to showcase at the tribunal as a crucial means of 
deterring more rapes from being committed during the conflict. He 
was not even within the investigators' main region of concentration, 
the Prijedor district. He also was not in custody. </P>

<P>Did that first indictment relieve the pressure on the tribunal to get 
results? "Not very much," Goldstone admits. (At press time Nikolic 
remained at large; the prosecution has filed no further proceedings 
concerning him since his indictment.) </P>

<P>In fact, in an interview with The American Lawyer shortly after the 
indictment was issued, Professor Bassiouni, the former head of the 
commission of experts, voiced his concern about the tribunal's ability 
to carry out its mandate. </P>

<P>"You should call your story the 'Potemkin Tribunal,' " fretted 
Bassiouni last November. "They have a magnificent building in The 
Hague, a great prosecution team. But in the end when you look behind 
that to see what's there, the answer is 'not much.' " </P>

<P>Bassiouni suggested then that despite the Nikolic indictment, the 
tribunal was still merely a facade behind which the U.N. could hide 
when criticized for botching its so-called "peacekeeping" mission in 
the Balkans. The U.N., he posited, had no intention of letting its own 
tribunal muck up the peace that some of its more powerful members, 
namely France and Great Britain, were then brokering with the Serb 
leaders--leaders who had been identified as probable war criminals 
way back in December 1992 by then--U.S. Secretary of State Lawrence 
Eagleburger. </P>

<P>"Even after you achieve something, people just want more," sighs 
Goldstone. More, however, was just around the corner. </P>

<P>In February 1994 German police had arrested Dusko "Dule" Tadic in 
Munich, where he had been hiding out at his brother's apartment. 
Refugees from the Serbian death camps now living in Germany had 
spotted their tormentor and identified him to German authorities as a 
Bosnian Serb who participated in a series of horrific crimes against his 
former Muslim neighbors in the Prijedor district of Bosnia. (Germany 
arrested and charged Tadic under international war crimes laws with 
aggravated assault and murder, or crimes against humanity, as well as 
genocide.) </P>

<P>Graham Blewitt had heard of Tadic's arrest long before Goldstone's 
arrival and had been keeping tabs on the German proceedings. Shortly 
after Goldstone came on the scene in August 1994, though, Goldstone 
locked in on the bird nearly in hand, shifting a team of 20 
investigators, lawyers, and analysts to Tadic and others who allegedly 
committed atrocities at the Omarska concentration camp in mid-1992. </P>

<P>On November 8, the day after Nikolic was indicted, Goldstone 
formally asked Germany to defer prosecution of Tadic to the tribunal. 
(In addition to the practical effect of granting the tribunal exclusive 
jurisdiction, deferral proceedings are a potent public relations tool, 
permitting the prosecution to air unsubstantiated charges against 
individuals prior to their indictment and signaling the tribunal's 
imminent indictment of those accused in local war crimes 
proceedings.) The tribunal supported its request with 13 pieces of 
documentary evidence-such as maps, newspaper clippings, and 
photographs-and 19 statements from witnesses scattered throughout 
Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. But it 
took nearly six months for the German parliament to pass a law 
permitting the transfer of the case to the tribunal. </P>

<P>Meanwhile, pressure on the prosecutors to act came from a surprising 
new quarter: the tribunal judges. On February 1 president Cassese 
issued an odd press release on the judges' behalf in which they "wished 
to express their concern about the urgency with which appropriate 
indictments should be issued," and that went on to state that the judges 
"were anxious that a programme of indictments should effectively 
meet the expectations of the Security Council and of the world 
community at large." </P>

<P>The release is pure Cassese: prickly, brazen, impassioned. But it also 
betrays Cassese's civil law roots, where the prosecutor and the judges 
are often more or less on the same side, as well as perhaps the hubris 
and inexperience of a law professor turned judge. </P>

<P>Prosecutors who had been in the trenches for months weren't pleased. 
"They were impatient and frustrated," says Blewitt. "But we were 
already aware of the urgency of getting some results. We thought it 
was a useless statement." </P>

<P>Indeed, two other judges interviewed for this article, McDonald and 
Malaysian judge Lal Vohrah--both from common law countries--say 
they do not believe it is their role to tell the prosecutor how to do his 
job. "We want to work, to try cases," says Vohrah, 61, a thoughtful, 
articulate jurist who gave up a spot on what is now Malaysia's highest 
court to join the tribunal. "But who is to be prosecuted is not our 
responsibility." (Vohrah, in fact, says he does not remember if he 
discussed Cassese's release before it went public.) </P>

<P>Goldstone is diplomatically taciturn on the topic, noting only that he 
had spoken to Cassese before the statement was released and agreed 
that issuing indictments of the leaders with command responsibility as 
soon as possible was a goal. He declines otherwise to comment, noting 
that the relationship between the prosecutors and the judges was a 
"sensitive one that was not a matter for public debate." </P>

<P>Cassese makes no apologies. "Nikolic was small fry," he contends. 
"Allegedly he killed a few people. Minor thugs who rape or kill, 
without command responsibility, should be [handled] by the state 
courts." (The indictment does specifically refer to Nikolic's command 
responsibility as camp commander; and includes eight counts of 
murder.) </P>

<P>The tension between the two men and their departments now seems to 
be subsiding. But Judge McDonald's delicate assessment? "Let's just 
say that relations between the office of the prosecutor and the judges 
have not been as close as they were in the past." </P>

<P>Whether or not it was Cassese's doing, the tribunal did blast into 
action shortly after this intramural spat. </P>

<P>THE TURNING POINT<BR>
On February 13 the tribunal indicted Tadic and his 20 death camp 
colleagues--the commander, guards, and several Serb visitors to 
Omarska. In April Germany turned Tadic over to the tribunal in The 
Hague, where he became the sole occupant of Cassese's twenty-first-
century detention center. The tribunal finally had a defendant in 
custody. </P>

<P>In May Goldstone dropped two bombshells. First, he expanded the 
tribunal's prosecutorial scope by requesting Bosnian authorities to 
cease their own prosecution in the Lasva River Valley investigation. 
That investigation--into the April 1993 slaughter of some 114 Muslim 
women, children, and old men from the village of Ahmici, Bosnia, in 
front of scores of survivors and other witnesses--targeted Bosnian 
Croats. Previously, all 21 of those indicted by the tribunal were 
Bosnian Serbs. It was a carefully calculated move by Goldstone: "It's 
crucial that the mechanism is perceived as fair by all sides" to the 
conflict, he explains, in order to "break through the endless cycle of 
atrocity and revenge." </P>

<P>Goldstone had again taken a page from his South African experience 
investigating the causes of political violence. "He recognized that the 
credibility of the tribunal depended on demonstrating we would go 
after Croats, Serbs, and Muslims alike," says deputy prosecutor 
Blewitt. </P>

<P>Then, a week after the Lasva Valley deferral application was filed last 
May, Goldstone filed a controversial deferral application with the 
Bosnian war crimes commission related to the Bosnian Serb 
leadership--namely Karadzic, General Mladic, and former police chief 
Mico Stanisic. (Bosnia has set up its own war crimes commission and 
was then in the process of investigating the Bosnian Serb leadership.) 
The application specifically mentioned investigating their command 
responsibility for "genocide, other serious offenses against civilians, 
and destruction of cultural and historical monuments," as well as the 
"protracted siege of Sarajevo and the unlawful attacks upon civilian 
members of humanitarian agencies, members of the United Nations 
peacekeeping forces, aid convoys, and aircraft at Sarajevo." </P>

<P>The peace negotiators instantly expressed their distress at Goldstone's 
timing. "This decision could damage the peace efforts in the Balkans," 
warned a spokesman for the Russian foreign ministry. A cease-fire was 
on the verge of expiring; negotiators now faced the prospect of making 
a new deal with named war crimes suspects. To add insult to injury, 
Goldstone announced that the suspects would likely face indictments 
by the end of the year. </P>

<P>At an April 24 press conference, according to a wire report from 
Agence France-Presse, Goldstone had a simple response to the 
supposed political inconvenience of his announcement: "We're not 
politicians, we're lawyers." </P>

<P>With the Tadic arraignment, the deferral applications, and nine 
investigation teams churning toward more indictments, the image of 
the tribunal as a do-nothing Security Council lapdog has been 
vanquished, possibly forever. Even Professor Bassiouni voices cautious 
optimism on the future of the tribunal: "I think there is a momentum 
building in world public opinion, a moral drive by the media, [the 
human rights] community, and scholars to give legitimacy and 
credibility to this tribunal." </P>

<P>Since April, in fact, the tribunal has had enough activity from Tadic 
alone to keep up a steady trickle of good press. In June the trial 
chamber heard motions on the protection of victims and witnesses in 
the case. In July the court heard a defense motion challenging its 
jurisdiction; on August 10 the tribunal denied the defense motion. The 
court will soon hear defense motions to exclude testimony obtained 
from the German prosecutors and on double jeopardy. (The defense 
claims that because German authorities had commenced judicial 
proceedings against Tadic, the tribunal is precluded from trying him.) </P>

<P>On July 25 the tribunal indicted the Bosnian Serb leadership, Karadzic 
and General Mladic, for their command responsibility for the 
commission of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. 
(Karadzic, Mladic, and 43 other war crimes indictees are still at large 
in Serbian-held areas of Bosnia or Croatia. Not surprisingly, Karadzic 
does not recognize the tribunal's competence and has said he will not 
turn over his citizens to stand trial.) Decisions, appeals, and perhaps 
more indictments can be expected to keep the tribunal in the public eye 
sporadically until November. With no other suspects in custody, 
prosecutors may also consider filing a Rule 61 proceeding for some of 
those indicted, such as Susica camp commander Dragan Nikolic. </P>

<P>Rule 61 of the tribunal's code of criminal procedure is the common law 
answer to trials in absentia. It permits the prosecutor, after trying and 
failing to get jurisdiction over an indictee, to put on his entire case 
against that suspect, in public, before the tribunal. Witnesses may be 
called and evidence entered. If there are reasonable grounds for 
concluding that the accused committed the crimes indicated, the 
tribunal says so and issues an international arrest warrant. "It literally 
turns those indicted into international fugitives," says Goldstone. </P>

<P>If a U.N. member state refuses to turn over the subject of the arrest 
warrant, the matter is referred to the Security Council, which may 
consider imposing sanctions against the offending state. </P>

<P>The net effect of Rule 61 is to air allegations and, more importantly, to 
restrict the accused to their own country. If they travel to or through 
any of the 185 U.N. member states, they are subject to arrest. "Sooner 
or later we will [get custody of more alleged war criminals]," says 
Minna Schrag, the American prosecutor. "Because we keep getting 
information on people who travel." </P>

<P>But for now the tribunal has a far more interesting proceeding to 
pursue: the Tadic trial. </P>

<P>ALLEGED BLOOD LUST<BR>
Dusko Tadic would have been cut from the first casting call to play a 
war criminal in the 1961 movie Judgment at Nuremberg. The somber, 
shifty-eyed man in the dock during the pre-trial proceedings (a Dustin 
Hoffman look-alike) looks more like an insurance or car salesman 
than a war criminal. </P>

<P>Yet court papers and press reports paint a picture of Tadic as a 
thuggish part-time karate instructor and caf owner in the town of 
Kozarac, who rose to power in the local Serbian Democratic Party as 
pan-Serb nationalism exploded in late 1991. Even the photographs of 
Tadic taken prior to his arrest suggest a burlier, more dangerous 
person than the cowed man in the button-down shirts now appearing 
at the tribunal. </P>

<P>He was described by one Muslim refugee as an arrogant, vengeful man 
who liked to show off his martial arts skill. "He was known around 
Kozarac as gratuitously violent, ready to beat up those who had 
slighted him," The New York Times Magazine reported last October. 
"And he was financially vulnerable, in debt to Muslim acquaintances." </P>

<P>The stage was set, then, for Tadic to strike back at his perceived 
enemies when the Serbs seized control of Kozarac and other towns in 
the Prijedor area in early 1992. According to the declaration that war 
crimes prosecutor Michael Keegan filed in Tadic's November 8 
deferral proceeding (which summarized the testimony of dozens of 
witnesses and several documents), "although [Tadic] had very good 
relations with the Muslim population prior to 1992, at the start of the 
tensions in the area, he banned Muslims from his caf." </P>

<P>When the policy of ethnic cleansing was instituted to rid the Prijedor 
region of non-Serbs, Tadic became one of its chief proponents. 
"Eyewitness accounts identify Tadic as being personally involved in 
the forced removal of Muslims from the Prijedor area and the looting 
and destruction of Muslim homes," Keegan attested. </P>

<P>Prosecutors claim Tadic, a married father of two, became his former 
Muslim neighbors' worst nightmare. </P>

<P>According to Keegan's declaration, Tadic had served as a local 
policeman and was an officer in the reserve militia. After the conflict 
broke out, he assisted local Serb commanders who were compiling a 
death list of the area's intellectuals, civic leaders, and prominent 
Muslims. When the death camps like Omarska opened in early 1992, 
many of their first prisoners were on these lists and were allegedly 
killed or have since disappeared. </P>

<P>In May 1992, according to Tadic's indictment, Serb forces rounded up 
all Bosnian Muslims and Croats in the Kozarac area and marched 
them into the city of Prijedor, where they boarded buses for the various 
camps that had been set up in the Prijedor opstina. </P>

<P>In a similar incident in June, Tadic allegedly forcibly removed 13 
unarmed non-Serb men from their homes, made the victims "lie on the 
ground, beat them with thick wooden sticks, kicked them, and then 
took them from the village to an unknown location," according to the 
indictment. </P>

<P>The Keegan declaration alleges that the worst of Tadic's sadistic 
activities took place at the Omarska death camp, which he visited 
"almost daily (or nightly)." Omarska was an abandoned iron ore 
complex. The 5,000 prisoners who reportedly passed through lived in 
inconceivably inhumane conditions. Many were held in an open ore 
pit, with no shelter, no toilets, and little food or water. Tadic held no 
rank in the Bosnian Serb army and was not part of the camp's Serbian 
staff. Yet he allegedly often wore a camouflage uniform (and 
occasionally a black mask) and directed the activities of the men who 
accompanied him and the camp guards. "Tadic was also seen in the 
presence of the camp commander, giving directions to camp staff on 
the arrival of new prisoners," alleged Keegan. </P>

<P>The Keegan declaration claims that Tadic "beat and tortured prisoners 
on a daily basis and is personally responsible for the murder of more 
than ten prisoners. . . ." The indictment zeroes in on six incidents in 
which Tadic is accused of raping one woman, murdering 13 men, and 
torturing those men and scores of others. And then, of course, there is 
the alleged castration incident. </P>

<P>According to the indictment, in late June 1992 Tadic and other 
Serbian camp visitors entered a large building at Omarska known as 
the "hangar" and called five prisoners out of their rooms by name. The 
Times Magazine noted that three of those men were supposed rivals of 
Tadic for women or karate championships. One, according to a report 
in Newsday, may have been a policeman with whom Tadic had had a 
run-in prior to the war. </P>

<P>Tadic and others then "severely beat the prisoners with various objects 
and kicked them on their heads and bodies," the indictment charges. 
After Fikret Harambasic was beaten, two more prisoners, identified in 
the indictment as "G" and "H," were allegedly called out. What 
happened next, as asserted by G himself, was a spectacle so traumatic, 
so nauseating, that it "shattered camp morale," according to the Times 
Magazine. </P>

<P>One Serb, the indictment continues, "ordered G and H to lick 
Harambasic's buttocks and genitals and then to sexually mutilate 
Harambasic. H covered Harambasic's mouth to silence his screams and 
G bit off one of Harambasic's testicles." </P>

<P>The versions of the story contained in the Times Magazine, the 
Newsday account, Keegan's declaration, and the indictment vary in 
minor details. But the end result is uncontroverted, at least among 
these accounts, which Tadic denies. Harambasic was castrated; he and 
two other prisoners who had been beaten unconscious with metal rods, 
truncheons, and knives died from their injuries. </P>

<P>Tadic has pled not guilty to all charges and claims all these accounts 
of his activities are untrue. "His main defense will be the defense of 
alibi, that he was not at the places at the times alleged," says his lead 
defense counsel, Dutchman Michail Wladimiroff. </P>

<P>The prosecutors, led by senior prosecuting trial attorney Grant 
Niemann, expect to put 50 to 60 witnesses on the stand who will 
testify otherwise. "The evidence is quite good," says Niemann. </P>

<P>POST-TADIC?<BR>
Grant Niemann, 45, is well-suited to prosecute the first international 
war crimes case in 50 years. One of the first prosecutors to arrive at 
the tribunal, in June 1994, he immediately began working on the 
prosecution of ethnic cleansing and the war crimes committed in the 
Prijedor section of Bosnia, where Tadic allegedly committed his 
crimes. </P>

<P>A stocky, ruddy-complexioned Australian with wavy white hair tucked 
back behind his ears, Niemann comes off as a pugnacious prosecutor 
but also a compassionate advocate for the war crimes victims. That 
soft center is perhaps unsurprising for a lawyer who spent his early 
years representing aboriginals in their land claims against the 
Australian government. And the gruff exterior can likewise be traced 
to his past: as the equivalent of the U.S. attorney in Adelaide from 
1985 to 1994, Niemann tried two Nazi war crimes cases and assisted 
on a third. (The first ended in an acquittal; the second was adjourned 
for lack of evidence and the third was terminated after the defendant 
suffered a heart attack and was deemed unfit to stand trial.) </P>

<P>According to Niemann, the decision to indict and try Tadic was, in 
one respect, an easy one. In stark contrast to the 21 other indicted war 
criminals, Tadic was in custody. It didn't hurt that the Tadic files were 
fairly complete. "The Germans had done a very good and very 
thorough investigation themselves and turned their material over to 
us," says Niemann. </P>

<P>Still, Goldstone has repeatedly said that the tribunal's resources do not 
permit it to go after low-level players. Where does Tadic fit into that 
grand scheme? </P>

<P>Goldstone admits the obvious: You have to start somewhere. 
"Witnesses can only implicate those they came into contact with on a 
local level," he explains. "Some of the leaders are saying that the 
events were random and unplanned. We need to establish a pattern of 
activity." And, he adds, go after people involved at a local level, like 
Tadic. </P>

<P>The Tadic case, Goldstone and Niemann acknowledge, may not 
exactly open the judicial floodgates; at press time he was the sole 
defendant in the tribunal's custody. And the trial of a single man is, of 
course, only a small step toward justice and accountability in the 
Balkans. "It'd be nice to know what happens after the first case ends," 
says Niemann. "It'd be nice to have them lined up." </P>

<P>But if Tadic is the only trial, it will be that much more important. 
Because at the very least "we expose those who committed the crimes 
to public scrutiny," explains tribunal president Cassese. "And with the 
international community so totally impotent to deal with these crimes 
otherwise, this result is not so meager." </P>

<P>And more importantly, the Tadic trial, beamed throughout the world 
by satellite, could send a message to the Serbs, Croats, and Bosnians--
and for that matter, citizens of every country--that war crimes will not 
be tolerated, that whether it is next week or ten years from now, those 
who step over the bounds of acceptable behavior may end up being 
held accountable for their actions. </P>

<P>As Judge McDonald succinctly puts it: "We are here to tell people that 
the rule of law has to be respected." </P>

<H2>Tadic Trial Primer</H2>

<P><B>A Guide to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia</B></P>

<P>William W. Horne and Hillary Kessler<BR>
<I>The American Lawyer</I></P>

<P>WHERE:<BR>
The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia is in The Hague, the Netherlands, a city located 35 miles outside of Amsterdam. The tribunal was created by the U.N. Security Council in February 1993 and is funded by the U.N. General Assembly. It is in no way related to the International Court of Justice, also located in The Hague. The ICJ, or World Court, hears civil disputes between nations; the tribunal prosecutes and tries individuals.</P>

<P>The trial will take place in the tribunal's $900,000 customized state-of-the-art courtroom that includes simultaneous video and audio translation into English, French, and Serbo-Croat. A nearly instantaneous transcript of the proceedings appears on a color monitor that every participant in the trial has at his or her fingertips. That same monitor can be used to flash up visual and documentary evidence; it may be connected to a participant's laptop computer or may be tuned in to the live feed of the trial from one of the courtroom's four television cameras. Those cameras will be operated by the tribunal, but a live feed has been given to four primary outside networks, including Court TV.</P>

<P>Witness security being a paramount concern, many sessions may be in camera. Also, testimony may be transmitted from remote locations, from disguised witnesses whose voices may be altered.</P>

<P>WHEN:<BR>
Opening arguments are scheduled to commence in November. Prosecutors estimate the trial will run some six weeks.</P>

<P>DEFENDANT:<BR>
Dusko Tadic, 39, former cafe owner, karate instructor, and policeman in Kozarac, Bosnia. Married, two children.</P>

<P>CRIMES ALLEGED:<BR>
132 separate counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes under the Geneva Conventions [see "Glossary"] relating to a rape and several murders, assaults, and torture incidents, committed in May, June, and July 1992.</P>

<P>Tadic is not charged with genocide, the most serious crime over which the tribunal has jurisdiction, nor is he charged with command responsibility.</P>

<P>DEFENSE:<BR>
Alibi, wasn't at place at time alleged.</P>

<P>DEFENSE LAWYERS:<BR>
Professor Michail Wladimiroff, 50, Dutch, part-time professor of economic criminal law at the University of Utrecht. Senior partner in The Hague's 16-lawyer Wladimiroff & Spong, the largest criminal defense firm in the Netherlands. A white-collar crime expert, he successfully defended directors of Slavenburg Bank (now part of Credit Lyonnais) against charges of falsifying bank records from 1983 to 1987. Appointed in April 1995 and paid by the tribunal at the rate of $23 an hour for a maximum of $200 a day. (His usual rate is $350/day.) Assisted by law firm partner Alfons Orie and several law students. Wladimiroff says he has had "little to no help" from his Serbian co-counsel, though they have assisted Wladimiroff in getting access to Bosnian Serb- controlled areas of the former Yugoslavia.</P>

<P>Milan Vujin, 50, Serbian, from Belgrade; has defended several people accused of war crimes in the Serbian courts. Wladimiroff says Vujin is the head of the Serbian bar association.</P>

<P>Krstan Simic, in his early 40s, Serbian; a "rural country lawyer," says Wladimiroff, from Banja Luka, in Serbian- controlled Bosnia.</P>

<P>PROSECUTORS:<BR>
Grant Niemann, 45, Australian, former federal director of public prosecutions in South Australia. Helped prosecute three suspected Nazi war criminals in Adelaide before joining the tribunal in July 1994.</P>

<P>Lt. Col. Brenda Hollis, 49, American, on loan from U.S. Air Force Judge Advocate General's office; former Air Force circuit prosecutor and appellate government counsel. Joined tribunal in July 1994.</P>

<P>Major Michael Keegan, 37, American, on loan from the U.S. Marine Corps Judge Advocate General's office. Joined tribunal in June 1994.</P>

<P>Alan Tieger, 45, American, on loan from the Justice Department's criminal section of the civil rights division. Prosecutor in federal trial of four Los Angeles police officers accused of beating Rodney King. Joined tribunal in June 1994.</P>

<P>Hollis, Keegan, and Tieger are paid by the United States government.</P>

<P>PROSECUTORS' INTERNATIONAL LAW ADVISER:<BR>
Cmdr. William Fenrick, 51, Canadian, retired from navy. International military law expert; was a member of the commission of experts that first investigated the alleged commission of war crimes.</P>

<P>JUDGES:<BR>
The tribunal has two trial chambers and one appeals chamber. Tadic's trial chamber consists of:</P>

<P>PRESIDING JUDGE: Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, 53, American.</P>

<P>Lal Vohrah, 61, Malaysian, Malaysian High Court judge. Has represented Malaysia at United Nations conferences and international territorial negotiations.</P>

<P>Sir Ninian Stephen, 72, Australian. Appointed to the High Court of Australia in 1972, and to the Judicial Committee of Great Britain's Privy Council in 1979 (Britain's highest appeals court). Governor general of Australia from 1982 to 1989.</P>

<P>RULES AND INTERESTING FACTS:<BR>
1) The territorial jurisdiction is limited to the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The time period is from January 1, 1991, until the time peace is restored.</P>

<P>2) No jury; as in civil law systems, the judges both find facts and determine guilt.</P>

<P>3) Guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</P>

<P>4) No trial in absentia.</P>

<P>5) Rule 61 permits evidence and indictment to be entered in open court when an indicted suspect cannot be apprehended. Serves a documentary rather than a judicial function but judges may issue an arrest warrant after hearing the evidence, making the suspect an international fugitive. Not applicable to Tadic case, since he is in custody.</P>

<P>6) Jurisdiction is concurrent with national courts, but the tribunal may request that national courts discontinue proceedings in deference to the tribunal. A double jeopardy clause means that no one may be tried before a national court for the same offense that has been tried by the tribunal. However, the tribunal may try someone for a crime heard by a national court if it was not classified as a war crime or if the tribunal determines that the national court proceedings were not impartial.</P>

<P>7) Any "relevant evidence" that has "probative value" is admissible; the rules require reciprocal discovery.</P>

<P>8) Maximum sentence is life imprisonment. Sentences will be served in one of 11 countries that have agreed to house tribunal prisoners: Muslim-controlled Bosnia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iran, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Spain, and Sweden.</P>

<P>9) Pardons and commutation are possible if permitted by the state in which the criminal is imprisoned. The tribunal president determines whether pardon or commutation is appropriate after weighing the gravity of the crimes, treatment of similarly situated prisoners, the prisoner's demonstration of rehabilitation, and the prisoner's degree of cooperation with the prosecutor.</P>

<P><B>Glossary</B></P>

<P>COMMAND RESPONSIBILITY: An individual who knew or had to reason to know that persons in positions subordinate to him were about to commit or had already committed war crimes, and failed to take the necessary and reasonable steps to prevent or to punish the commission of those crimes, is held individually responsible for the crimes.</P>

<P>CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY: Prohibited acts such as murder, rape, sexual assault, torture, or persecution on political, racial, or religious grounds committed in armed conflict, international or national in character, and as a part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population.</P>

<P>GENOCIDE: Prohibited acts such as killing members of a group or causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of a group committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, or religious group.</P>

<P>GRAVE BREACHES OF THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949: Failure to protect civilians in time of war, including forcible sexual intercourse.</P>

<P>VIOLATIONS OF THE LAWS OR CUSTOMS OF WAR: Crimes against persons who took no part in the hostilities, in particular violence to life and person, murder, rape and sexual assault, cruel treatment, and torture, as well as outrages upon personal dignity (in particular humiliating and degrading treatment).</P>

<H2>Judging Tadic</H2>

<P>Former U.S. District Judge in Houston Answers State Department's Call</P>

<P>William Horne<BR>
<I>The American Lawyer</I></P>

<P>When Gabrielle Kirk McDonald was approached by a U.S. State Department
official in the summer of 1993 about becoming one of 11 justices on
the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, she was
intrigued but hesitant.</P>

<P>"What did I know about war crimes and international humanitarian law?"
she recalls thinking. "And I already had plans . . . to teach for the
next ten years."</P>

<P>McDonald, who was a federal judge in Houston from 1979 to 1988, was
about to begin teaching full-time at Texas Southern University's
Thurgood Marshall School of Law in Houston. In the end, though, she
concluded that her experience as a judge in criminal cases and as a
teacher was relevant to the tribunal's work.</P>

<P>"It seemed to me that you could develop and create law and do some
good too," she explains in her large, sun-filled office at the
tribunal in The Hague. "That's exactly what I've done all my life as
both a lawyer and a teacher."</P>

<P>Tall, elegant, with an easy smile and sharp wit, McDonald, 53, is the
sole American and one of two women on the court. She will soon be the
focus of worldwide attention as the presiding judge in the Dusko Tadic
case, the first war crimes trial since Nuremberg. McDonald, however,
is not unused to the spotlight. </P>

<P>Born in St. Paul and raised first in Manhattan, then in Teaneck, New
Jersey, she attended Boston University and Hunter College, but never
earned an undergraduate degree. McDonald nonetheless enrolled at
Howard University School of Law, graduated first in her class in 1966,
and accepted a coveted slot as a staff attorney with the NAACP Legal
Defense and Educational Fund Inc. in New York. "I wanted to change the
world," she recalls.</P>

<P>She is proud of the three-year stint that took her into the deep South
-- Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia -- to work on some of the first
plaintiffs employment discrimination cases that were based upon Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In 1967, for example, she was the
lead NAACP staff attorney on the first significant plaintiffs Title
VII win, a claim against Philip Morris Companies Inc. for its
discriminatory seniority system.</P>

<P>The defense fund work gave McDonald, who is African-American, her
first taste of southern prejudice. "It was frightening," she says of
the hostility she encountered from some white southerners. "I remember
meeting with civil rights workers in a church in Laurel, Mississippi.
And when we finished I was trying to decide where I'd be safest [if we
were attacked]. As the first one out of the church, or in the middle,
or maybe the end."</P>

<P>McDonald was never attacked, but the experience convinced her to carry
on with civil rights work when she moved to Texas in 1969 and joined
her then-husband Mark McDonald's solo practice. "When I came to
Houston, no one was filing civil rights cases," she says. "Something
had to be done." </P>

<P>Over the next ten years McDonald and her husband built a reputation
for taking on plaintiffs discrimination cases -- many of them Title
VII claims -- against big companies with significant operations in
Texas, including Union Carbide Corporation, Monsanto Company, and
Diamond Shamrock, Inc. McDonald asserts that most of the big-firm
lawyers representing these companies had been used to dealing only
with unfair labor claims filed with the National Labor Relations
Board. "I used to tease them, 'Thanks to me you've got a whole new
area of practice!' " she cracks.</P>

<P>Her biggest win came in 1976, when she and Mark McDonald negotiated a
settlement with the Lone Star Steel Company on behalf of 400 black
workers for $1.2 million in back wages. Chris Dixie, a management-side
defense lawyer in Houston who often battled McDonald, told The Houston
Post in 1978 that in her field, "she must be the best in the South, if
not better."</P>

<P>McDonald's reputation brought her to the attention of another Texan,
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, who put her name up for a federal judgeship in
1978. In 1979 President Jimmy Carter appointed McDonald, then 37, as a
federal district judge in Houston, only the third African-American
woman to be appointed to the federal bench.</P>

<P>As a judge McDonald handled a full civil and criminal docket. Her race
became an issue in several of the more high-profile cases she handled.
In 1981 she was asked to recuse herself in a dispute between American
and Vietnamese fishermen over shrimp in the Gulf of Mexico. "The
American [fishermen] had called in the Ku Klux Klan to help solve the
problem and the Klan did that by -- allegedly -- burning several
shrimp boats," she recounts. After the Southern Poverty Law Center,
based in Montgomery, Alabama, filed an antitrust suit on behalf of the
Vietnamese shrimpers against the American shrimpers and the KKK, the
Klan's Grand Dragon, Louis Beam, claimed in open court that they could
not get a fair trial because McDonald was a "Negress."</P>

<P>She refused to step down, and things got nasty. McDonald says she
received hate mail, including four one-way tickets to Africa. (She has
two children.) Klan members attended the hearings. A metal detector
was installed in the courthouse for the first time.</P>

<P>In the end she stood firm, enjoining the Klan from intimidating the
Vietnamese fishermen with bellicose displays, boat-burning, or
threats. Morris Dees, Jr., head of the poverty law center, was
impressed with McDonald's ability to focus on the issues, even in the
face of Beam's verbal assault. "She bent over backwards to be fair to
the Klan," he says, pointing out that her injunction was crafted not
to infringe upon the Klan's right to assemble.</P>

<P>In 1984 McDonald presided over a case involving attorneys' fees in a
voting rights class action that had been filed against the city of
Houston on behalf of all black and Hispanic voters. The city attorney,
citing McDonald's race, claimed she was part of the class and asked
her to recuse herself. She refused, writing in her decision -- which
was upheld by the Fifth Circuit -- that, "if my race is enough to
disqualify me hearing this case, then I must disqualify myself as well
from a substantial portion of cases on my docket," an action that
"would cripple my efforts to fulfill my oath as a federal judge."</P>

<P>According to a fellow judge and five Texas lawyers familiar with her
work, McDonald was a competent, fair jurist. Still, her civil rights
decisions notwithstanding, she is criticized by one prominent civil
rights lawyer.</P>

<P>"I was disappointed with her as a judge," says James Harrington, legal
director of the Texas Civil Rights Project. "She seemed pretty
cautious and never staked out a place for herself . . . never
developed a jurisprudence in civil rights, or in anything else, for
that matter." </P>

<P>McDonald disputes that assertion, citing half a dozen cases where she
ruled in favor of the ACLU or took a civil libertarian view in her
ruling. And the former U.S. attorney in Houston, Daniel Hedges, who
was appointed by President Ronald Reagan and is now name partner of
Houston's Porter & Hedges, praises McDonald for not permitting her
civil rights background to cloud her judgment as a federal judge. "She
was always evenhanded," recalls Hedges, whose prosecutors had several
cases before McDonald while he was in office. "And as horrible as war
crimes are, those defendants are entitled to a fair and impartial
trier of fact. She is that."</P>

<P>The only other low mark came from a Houston litigator, who, echoing
comments made by Houston practitioners in the 1988 Almanac of the
Federal Judiciary, asserts that while McDonald was "very bright" and
had "exceptional analytical skills," she was "glacially slow; motions
would sit there for a year, a year and a half" without a decision. </P>

<P>Chief Judge Norman Black of the Southern District of Texas dismisses
that criticism. "They said that about all of us," says Black, another
Carter appointee who was sworn in with McDonald in 1979. "The fact is,
we all had an enormous, crushing caseload at the time."</P>

<P>By 1988 McDonald had tired of the judgeship and quit. Among the
reasons were her 1,000-case-a-year-docket and the $90,000 she was
earning annually as a federal judge. (McDonald is a divorced parent
whose children were then teenagers headed to college. By contrast,
Houston federal judges now handle an average load of 420 civil cases
and the cases of some 70 criminal defendants and earn $134,000
annually.)</P>

<P>McDonald opened the Austin office of San Antonio's Matthews &
Branscomb, where for the next two years she handled management- side
employment discrimination defense work. But she left two years later.
She didn't enjoy the work, she says, or the administrative tasks
entailed in running a four-lawyer office. </P>

<P>In 1991 she joined a small Austin firm now called Walker, Bright &
Whittenton as of counsel and began teaching at St. Mary's University
School of Law in San Antonio. McDonald has been teaching off and on
since 1970, when she taught an administrative law course at Texas
Southern University law school. The current dean of TSU's Thurgood
Marshall law school, James Douglas, recalls taking that course as a
student. "She has a real knack for teaching," he says.</P>

<P>In early 1993 Dean Douglas offered McDonald a one-year teaching post,
to commence with the fall 1993 semester. She recalls that she was
packing boxes in her Austin home for her move to Houston in the summer
of 1993 when she received a call from state department legal adviser
Conrad Harper, an old friend from their days together at the NAACP
Legal Defense and Educational Fund.</P>

<P>Would she be interested in a position on the war crimes tribunal? "She
seemed amazed to get such a telephone call," recalls Harper.</P>

<P>"I said yes in my mind but I told him no, I had plans," McDonald says.
Harper persisted, assuaging her concerns about her lack of
international law experience by pointing out that it was a criminal
tribunal and that she had nine years' experience trying criminal cases
on the federal bench. McDonald said she'd think about it. Harper says
he sent her some information about the job, and within a few days
McDonald agreed to be the U.S. candidate.</P>

<P>When 22 candidates for the 11 positions on the tribunal were submitted
to a committee of the U.N. general assembly that September, McDonald
received the highest number of votes. Harper attributes her popularity
to the effective lobbying by the State Department and the U.S.
delegation, as well as her broad experience as a civil rights lawyer,
judge, and academic.</P>

<P>For the next two months she worked with State Department lawyers and
professors at Thurgood Marshall law school -- where she continued to
teach full-time through the fall 1994 semester -- to draft a proposed
set of rules of procedure and evidence for the tribunal. (Compensation
is apparently no longer an issue for McDonald: In 1994, in addition to
her $145,000 tax-free tribunal salary, she earned approximately
$100,000 teaching at Thurgood Marshall, and an estimated $100,000
handling labor, commercial, and personal injury mediations for
Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services/Endispute.)</P>

<P>McDonald and the other judges were sworn in in The Hague in November
1993 and set to work creating a procedural code. McDonald recalls that
in her usual straightforward fashion she walked into the first meeting
and slapped down the rules she had drafted in the States: "I was like,
'You want the rules, here they are.' " she says with a laugh. "I guess
I was playing the typical American role -- we know it all, we control
it all."</P>

<P>The other judges, of course, were not about to adopt the U.S. version
wholesale. Indeed, several countries had submitted proposals for
various rules. "I was apologizing for being so presumptuous," says
McDonald ruefully, who notes that the current rules, arrived at after
four months of work, are a "wonderful amalgam" of common and civil law
concepts.</P>

<P>After the first draft of the code was completed in February 1994,
though, McDonald says, things got slow for nearly a year. The tribunal
prosecutors did file a series of indictments and deferral proceedings,
but for the judges the work was sporadic. McDonald flew to The Hague
only when she needed to. "It was boring," she recalls.</P>

<P>The boredom evaporated when the Tadic case picked up in April. Since
the presiding judge in the other trial chamber had signed the
indictment (and thus under the tribunal's rules had reviewed the bulk
of the prosecutors' evidence supporting the indictment), the trial of
the case automatically reverted to McDonald's three- judge chamber,
which she presides over. "I got the black bean," she says.</P>

<P>Since then she has taken a leave of absence from Thurgood Marshall.
She continues to handle JAMS mediations when she is in Houston but at
press time had started hunting for an apartment in The Hague. (She has
been staying in hotels.) Through the late spring and summer she has
heard a slew of defense and prosecution motions, many involving
brand-new issues of international human rights law. At a July 25
hearing on a defense motion challenging the court's jurisdiction, she
seemed articulate and well versed in the issues -- clearly at home in
the courtroom. In her first major ruling, on August 10, she struck
down that defense motion. "You fear being the first [to rule on these
new issues] and making a fool of yourself," she says. "But I like the
action -- this is why I wanted to be in a trial chamber and not in the
appeals chamber."</P>

<P>McDonald says that her experience trying criminal federal cases and
working as a lawyer to carve out civil rights laws has served her well
so far. But she is still getting up to speed on international
humanitarian law: "I've been reading night and day. I have big circles
under my eyes."</P>

<P>Still, with every day at the tribunal, McDonald's conviction that she
is doing the right thing has only grown stronger: "How can you tell
the little kid stealing a bike on the street that's wrong unless we
tell these people who commit unspeakable atrocities that they are
wrong?"</P>

<H2>Out of South Africa</H2>

<P>Prosecutor Postponed Taking High Court Job in South Africa to Join Tribunal </P>
 
<P>William Horne<BR>
<I>The American Lawyer</I></P>
 
<P>When news reports trickled out in late summer of 1992 that 
atrocities were being committed in the bitter struggle for control 
of the former Yugoslavia -- including mass rape, the eviction 
and killing of civilian populations as part of the Serbs' "ethnic 
cleansing" policy, and the creation of Nazi-like death camps 
where prisoners were tortured and often killed -- South African 
judge Richard Goldstone, now the tribunal's chief prosecutor, 
didn't have much time to dwell on the implications. Since 1991 
Goldstone had been chairing an inquiry into the causes of 
violence in South Africa. "I had my hands full," he notes with a 
thin smile.</P>

<P>In fact, the Standing Commission of Inquiry regarding the 
Prevention of Public Violence and Intimidation, widely known 
as the Goldstone Commission, played a critical role in defusing 
the partisan political violence that had been unleashed as 
apartheid, itself the result of ethnic cleansing, began eroding in 
the late 1980s. By 1991 the violence -- with daily killings in 
South Africa's black townships, and a white minority 
increasingly fearful of the implications of majority rule -- 
threatened the transition to democracy that President F.W. 
DeKlerk was then struggling through.</P>

<P>Desperate to keep the country from deteriorating into chaos, 
DeKlerk and some two dozen political parties, including the two 
largest, Nelson Mandela's African National Congress and the 
rival Inkatha Freedom Party, signed a shaky peace accord in 
September 1991. Part of that accord included the creation of the 
commission to investigate violence, to be chaired by someone 
acceptable to all 19 parties. That someone turned out to be 
Goldstone, then a judge on the appellate division of the South 
African Supreme Court, the country's highest court at that time.</P>

<P>Goldstone had been quietly undermining apartheid policies 
since joining the bench in 1980. In a landmark 1982 ruling, for 
instance, he essentially gutted the notorious Group Areas Act, 
which had restricted blacks to living in violent black townships. 
It was a clever piece of work: He did not just overturn the act, 
which might well then have been reinstated by the white 
parliament. Instead, he ruled in a carefully constructed decision 
that police must weigh certain factors before they could evict an 
elderly Indian woman from her home in a white suburb, the 
most important being whether they could provide her with 
alternative shelter of similar quality. Since housing standards in 
the mixed race and black townships fell far below that in white 
areas, the woman stayed, and the act became a toothless relic of 
the fading apartheid era.</P>

<P>"His decision put an end to use of the criminal courts to evict 
pursuant to the Group Areas Act," says President Nelson 
Mandela's personal lawyer, George Bizos of Johannesburg. 
Goldstone hadn't always been so strongly antiapartheid. His 
father owned two musical instrument stores, and Goldstone says 
that he grew up comfortably in an upper-middle-class Jewish 
household in a white suburb of Johannesburg, blithely unaware 
of what he now refers to as the "immorality and inhumanity" of 
apartheid. "For my first eighteen years I'd never met any blacks 
other than as subordinates, servants in our home and other 
people's homes," he confesses.</P>

<P>Goldstone's eyes were abruptly unblinkered when he attended a 
mixed-race school, the University of Witwatersrand, in 1957. "It 
became apparent to me immediately that when [my black 
classmates and I] were at school we were equals, but as soon as 
we left the grounds, blacks were treated as second- or third-class 
citizens," he says. In 1960, the year Goldstone was elected 
president of the student council, the government attempted to 
segregate universities. Goldstone and others protested 
vociferously, making public speeches and leading marches 
against the proposed measure, which failed. Goldstone says that 
was the last time he was involved in political activities.</P>

<P>Goldstone became a barrister in the then-bifurcated bar in 1963. 
From 1963 to 1980 Goldstone -- who, according to colleagues, 
was very ambitious and a hard worker -- built what fellow 
lawyer Bizos describes as "a large and successful" commercial 
and intellectual property practice in Johannesburg. In 1977, at 
the age of 38, he became one of the youngest members of the 
bar to "take silk," the expression for achieving the highest level 
of barrister. He was not involved at all during that period, he 
concedes, in the struggle for democracy and against apartheid.</P>

<P>That all changed when he was appointed to the Transvaal 
Supreme Court in 1980 at the age of 42 -- one of the youngest 
barristers to be sent up to the bench. Because of the labor, 
intellectual property, and corporations work he did as a lawyer, 
many of the cases assigned to Goldstone were rather dry, 
complex commercial matters. Nonetheless, when cases came to 
Goldstone that dealt with laws designed to preserve apartheid, 
he managed to strike them down.</P>

<P>And judges in South Africa were then the only officials who had 
the authority to visit prisons at any time to ensure that 
conditions were humane and that no mistreatment occurred. Few 
exercised that right; Goldstone, aware of the conditions imposed 
on blacks -- many of them political prisoners -- made these 
visits part of his job.</P>

<P>It was perhaps no surprise, then, that President DeKlerk asked 
Goldstone to conduct an investigation in 1990 into the shooting 
of several black demonstrators by police in the black township 
of Sebokeng. Goldstone's report castigated the police for firing 
without provocation and recommended they be prosecuted for 
murder. Ultimately, none were so prosecuted, but numerous 
damage suits were successfully brought against the policemen 
involved.</P>

<P>Two years later, Goldstone -- described by Bill Keller in a 1993 
New York Times article as "perhaps the most trusted man, 
certainly the most trusted member of the white establishment, in 
a land of corrosive suspicion" -- was a natural choice to be 
chairman of what became the Goldstone Commission. It had an 
unlimited budget and broad powers to search and seize 
evidence, subpoena witnesses, and compel testimony about the 
sources of political violence in South Africa. Thrust into the 
limelight, Goldstone excelled. For three years he appeared 
almost daily on the TV news and the front pages of the papers, a 
reassuring presence in such turbulent times. "He is a household 
name in South Africa," says Capetown lawyer Carl Pohl.</P>

<P>The pressures from all sides were tremendous: The government 
hoped he would determine that the black political parties were 
responsible for the numerous killings wracking the townships; 
the ANC wanted him to blame the Inkatha Freedom Party and a 
"third force" of military and police officials who conspired to 
preserve white dominion by inciting black-on-black violence. 
Conservative Afrikaaner fringe groups just wanted him to fail in 
his inquiry. In fact, he received death threats early on, and a 
detail of security officers became his constant companion for the 
next two years.</P>

<P>But finding the culprits ended up a secondary concern for 
Goldstone; the commission's priority became venting away the 
explosive anger resulting from violence that continued even as 
the commission convened. If a killing occurred in a township, 
Goldstone and his police and investigators became the authority 
in charge. "It was an important safety valve," he says, "because 
investigators were on the scene immediately and evidence was 
heard within a week at times."</P>

<P>For the first year Goldstone's commission turned out 
unsurprising reports, essentially laying the blame on the two 
largest parties, Inkatha and ANC. The turning point came in late 
1992, says Goldstone, when he requested and received his own 
independent police force to conduct investigations he directed. 
Goldstone and his commission immediately made some 
shocking discoveries. In November 1992, for example, a bold 
raid he authorized turned up a secret section of the government's 
military intelligence division that used dirty tricks to undermine 
the political power of the African National Congress. Presented 
with incontrovertible evidence, De Klerk dismissed or 
suspended some 23 members of the clandestine group.</P> 

<P>Finally, shortly before the elections last April, Goldstone 
discovered that some senior police and military officials, 
including a high-ranking general, had been selling arms to 
political factions, hoping to disrupt the armistice that the 
political parties had worked out prior to the elections. He rushed 
his report to the public, essentially forcing DeKlerk to address 
another embarrassing situation his appointee had created. The 
general refused to resign, but Goldstone would not back down, 
demanding that DeKlerk take action. In the end, DeKlerk 
suspended the general.</P>
 
<P>"I don't think DeKlerk or anyone else thought Goldstone would 
uncover what he uncovered," asserts Capetown lawyer Mervyn 
Smith.</P>
 
<P>While the government and Inkatha seemed to receive most of 
the blame for the violence, everyone was faulted by the 
commission at one point or another. "The best indication of 
success was that we incurred the wrath of every party involved," 
deadpans Goldstone.</P>

<P>His colleague, Constitutional Court justice Johann Kriegler, 
assesses Goldstone's commission work more charitably: "He 
played the political game as an outsider and had to walk a 
tightrope. But he is a surefooted tactician, and he maintained his 
credibility with people on all sides. That was damned difficult to 
do."</P>

<P>By mid-1994 the elections were complete and Goldstone had 
turned over the bulk of the commission's files to prosecutors to 
pursue further. It's worth noting that Goldstone maintained a full 
caseload as an appellate judge while he chaired the commission. 
His rationale reveals his practical, honorable approach to his 
fiduciary roles: He says he wanted to maintain his absolute 
independence and therefore took no pay for his role with the 
commission, but also felt that since he was collecting a full 
judge's salary, he should fulfill his duties in that arena as well.</P>

<P>Goldstone took a five-week vacation in Europe. When he 
returned, he was offered both the chief prosecutor's job at the 
war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and a position on 
South Africa's new Constitutional Court. Within a week, urged 
on by Nelson Mandela, he accepted the prosecutor's job. The 
high court position would be temporarily filled until he returned.</P>

<P>Not all his cohorts at the bench and bar agreed with his decision 
to go to work for some far-off tribunal. "I think it's a pity he 
took it," says Capetown lawyer Pohl. "There's a hell of a lot of 
work to be done here."</P>

<P>But he is inarguably a good choice for the position: "He'll be 
breaking new ground over there," says Justice Kriegler. "He's an 
innovative, creative lawyer, and I think he'll be good at that."</P>

 DECISION ON THE DEFENCE MOTION ON JURISDICTION

 The Office of the Prosecutor:

Mr. Grant Niemann Mr. Alan Tieger Mr. Michael Keegan Ms. Brenda Hollis
Mr. William Fenrick

 Counsel the Accused:

Mr. Michail Wladimiroff Mr. Milan Vujin Mr. Krstan Simic



DECISION

    On 23 June 1995 the Defence filed a preliminary motion, pursuant
to Rule 73 (A) (i) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence ("the
Rules") which provides for objections based on lack of jurisdiction,
seeking dismissal of all of the charges against the accused. The
Defence motion challenges the powers of the International Tribunal for
the Prosecution of Person Responsible for Serious Violations of
International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the
Former Yugoslavia since 1991 ("the International Tribunal") to try the
accused under three heads: the alleged improper establishment of the
International Tribunal; the improper grant of primacy to the
International Tribunal; and challenges to the subject-matter
jurisdiction of the International Tribunal. The Prosecutor contends
that none of these points is valid and that the International Tribunal
has jurisdiction over the accused as charged. The Government of the
United States of America has submitted a brief as amicus curiae.

   The argument of the parties on this motion was heard on 25 and 26
July and judgment on the motion was reserved, to be delivered this
day.

    THE TRIAL CHAMBER, HAVING CONSIDERED the written submissions and
oral arguments of the parties and the written submission of the amicus
curiae,

 REASONS FOR DECISION

I. The Establishment of the International Tribunal

A. Legitimacy of creation

 1. The attack on the competence of the International Tribunal in this
case is based on a number of grounds, some of which may be subsumed
under one general heading: that the action of the Security Council in
establishing the International Tribunal and in adopting the Statute
under which it functions is beyond power; hence the International
Tribunal is not duly established by law and cannot try the accused.

 2. It is said that, to be duly established by law, the International
Tribunal should have been created either by treaty, the consensual act
of nations, or by amendment of the Charter of the United Nations, not
by resolution of the Security Council. Called in aid of this general
proposition are a number of considerations: that before the creation
of the International Tribunal in 1993 it was never envisaged that such
an ad hoc criminal tribunal might be set up; that the General
Assembly, whose participation would at least have guaranteed full
representation of the international community, was not involved in its
creation; that it was never intended by the Charter that the Security
Council should, under Chapter VII, establish a judicial body, let
alone a criminal tribunal; that the Security Council had been
inconsistent in creating this tribunal while not taking a similar step
in the case of other areas of conflict in which violations of
international humanitarian law may have occurred; that the
establishment of the International Tribunal had neither promoted, nor
was capable of promoting, international peace, as the current
situation in the former Yugoslavia demonstrates; that the Security
Council could not, in any event, create criminal liability on the part
of individuals and that this is what the creation of the International
Tribunal did; that there existed and exists now no such international
emergency as would justify the action of the Security Council; that no
political organ such as the Security Council is capable of
establishing an independent and impartial tribunal; that there is an
inherent defect in the creation, after the event, of ad hoc tribunals
to try particular types of offences and, finally, that to give the
International Tribunal primacy over national courts is, in any event
and in itself, inherently wrong.

3.   Essential to these submissions is, of course, the concept that
this Trial Chamber has the capacity to review and rule upon the
legality of the acts of the Security Council in establishing the
International Tribunal. This the Defence asserts, doing so by way of
attack upon the jurisdiction of the International Tribunal.

4.   There are, clearly enough, matters of jurisdiction which are open
to determination by the International Tribunal, questions of time,
place and nature of an offence charged. These are properly described
as jurisdictional, whereas the validity of the creation of the
International Tribunal is not truly a matter of jurisdiction but
rather of the lawfulness of its creation, involving scrutiny of the
powers of the Security Council and of the manner of their exercise;
perhaps, too, of the appropriateness of its response to the situation
in the former Yugoslavia.

5.   The Trial Chamber has heard out the Defence in its submissions
involving judicial review of the actions of the Security Council.
However, this International Tribunal is not a constitutional court set
up to scrutinise the actions of organs of the United Nations. It is,
on the contrary, a criminal tribunal with clearly defined powers,
involving-a quite specific and limited criminal jurisdiction. If it is
to confine its adjudications to those specific limits, it will have no
authority to investigate the legality of its creation by the Security
Council.

6.  The force of criminal law draws its efficacy, in part, from the
fact that it reflects a consensus on what is demanded of human
behaviour. But it is of equal importance that a body that judges the
criminality of this behaviour should be viewed as legitimate. This is
the first time that the international community has created a court
with criminal jurisdiction. The establishment of the International
Tribunal has now spawned the creation of an ad hoc Tribunal for
Rwanda. Each of these ad hoc Tribunals represents an important step
towards the establishment of a permanent international criminal
tribunal. In this context, the Trial Chamber considers that it would
be inappropriate to dismiss without comment the accused's contentions
that the establishment of the International Tribunal by the Security
Council was beyond power and an ill-founded political action, not
reasonably aimed at restoring and maintaining peace, and that the
International Tribunal is not duly established by law.

7.   Any discussion of this matter must begin with the Charter of the
United Nations. Article 24 (1) provides that the Members of the United
Nations:

"confer on the Security Council primary responsibility for the
maintenance of international peace and security, and agree that in
carrying out its duties under this responsibility the Security Council
acts on their behalf."

The powers of the Security Council to discharge its primary
responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security
are set out in Chapters VI, VII, VIII and XII of the Charter. The
International Tribunal was established under Chapter VII. The Security
Council has broad discretion in exercising its authority under Chapter
VII and there are few limits on the exercise of that power. As
indicated by the travaux preparatoires:

"Wide freedom of judgment is left as regards the moment [the Security
Council] may choose to intervene and the means to be applied, with
sole reserve that it should act `in accordance with the purposes and
principles of the [United Nations'."

(See Statement of the Rapporteur of Committee III/3, Doc. 134,
IIE/3/3, 11 U.N.C.I.O. Docs. 785 (1945).)

The broad discretion given to the Security Council in the exercise of
its Chapter VII authority itself suggests that decisions taken under
this head are not reviewable.

8.  For the Defence it is said that it is a basic human right of an
accused to have a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent
and impartial tribunal established by law. The Defence asserts that
this right is protected by a panoply of principles of fundamental
justice recognized by human rights law. There can be no doubt that the
International Tribunal should seek to provide just such a trial;
indeed, in enacting its Statute, care has been taken by the Security
Council to ensure that this in fact occurs and the Judges of the
International Tribunal, in framing its Rules, have also paid
scrupulous regard to the requirements of a fair trial. For example,
Article 21 of the Statute of the International Tribunal guarantees the
accused the right to a fair trial and Article 20 obligates the Trial
Chambers to ensure that trials are. in fact, fair. There are several
other provisions to the same effect. However, it is one thing for the
Security Council to have taken every care to ensure that a structure
appropriate to the conduct of fair trials has been created; it is an
entirely different thing in any way to infer from that careful
structuring that it was intended that the International Tribunal be
empowered to question the legality of the law which established it.
The competence of the International Tribunal is precise and narrowly
defined; as described in Article I of its Statute, it is to prosecute
persons responsible for serious violations of international
humanitarian law, subject to spatial and temporal limits, and to do so
in accordance with the Statute. That is the full extent of the
competence of the International Tribunal.

9.  The Defence seeks to extend the competence of the International
Tribunal to review the actions of the Security Council by reference to
the Rules of the International Tribunal. It refers first to Rule 73
(A)(i), which provides that preliminary motions by the accused can
include: "objections based on lack of jurisdiction". That Rule relates
to challenges to jurisdiction and is no authority for engaging in an
investigation, not into jurisdiction, but into the legality of the
action of the Security Council in establishing the International
Tribunal. The Defence also points to Rule 91, False Testimony Under
Solemn Declaration, as an example of the exercise by the International
Tribunal of powers that are not explicitly provided for in its
Statute. There is, however, no analogy to be drawn between the
inherent authority of a Chamber to control its own proceedings and any
suggested power to review the authority of the Security Council.
Therefore, even were it conceivable that the Rules adopted by the
Judges could extend the competence of the International Tribunal, the
Rules referred to by the Defence do not support such an enlargement.

10.  The Defence relies on, or at least refers to, what has been said
by the International Court of Justice ("the Court") in three cases:
Certain Expenses of the United Nations, 1962 I.C.J. 151, 168 (Advisory
Opinion of 20 July) (the "Expenses Advisory Opinion"), Legal
Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in
Namibia (South-West Africa) Notwithstanding Security Council
Resolution 776, 1971 I.C.I. 16, 45 (Advisory Opinion of 21 June) (the
"Namibia Advisory Opinion ") and Questions of Interpretation and
Application of the 1971 Montreal Convention Arising from the Aerial
Incident at Lockerbie (Libya v. U.S.), 1992 I.C.J. 114, 176
(Provisional Measures Order of 14 April) (the "Lockerbie decision").
In the first of these, the Expenses Advisory Opinion, the Court
specifically stated that, unlike the legal system of some States,
there exists no procedure for determining the validity of acts of
organs of the United Nations. It referred to proposals at the time of
drafting of the Charter that such a power should be given to the Court
and to the rejection of those proposals.

11.  In the second of these cases, the Namibia Advisory Opinion, the
Court dealt very specifically with this matter, stating that:
"Undoubtedly, the Court does not possess powers of judicial review or
appeal in respect of the decisions taken by the United Nations organs
concerned".

12.  Finally, in the Lockerbie decision, Judge Weeramantry, in his
dissenting opinion, but in this respect not in dissent from other
members of the Court, said that "it is not for this Court to sit in
review on a given resolution of the Security Council" and, that in
relation to the exercise by the Security Council of its powers under
Chapter VII:

"the determination under Article 39 of the existence of any threat to
the peace ... is one entirely within the discretion of the Council....
the Council and no other is the judge of the existence of the state of
affairs which brings Chapter VII into operation.... Once [such a
determination is] taken the door is opened to the various decisions
the Council may make under that Chapter."

13.  These opinions of the Court clearly provide no basis for the
International Tribunal to review the actions of the Security Council,
indeed, they are authorities to the contrary.

14.  In support of its submission that this Trial Chamber should
review the actions of the Security Council, the Defence contends that
the decisions of the Security Council are not sacrosanct". Certainly,
commentators have suggested that there are limits to the authority of
the Security Council. It has been posited that such limits may be
based on Article 24 (2), which pro- ides that the Security Council:

"shall act in accordance with the Purposes and Principles of the
United Nations. The specific powers appointed to the Security Council
for the discharge of these duties are laid down in Chapters VI, VII,
VIII, and XII."

One commentator interprets this provision to mean that the Security
Council "cannot, in principle. act arbitrarily and unfettered by any
restraints." (D. W. Bowett, The Law of International Institutions 33
(1982).) Another commentator has taken the position that although the
Security Council has broad discretion in the field of international
peace and security, it cannot "act arbitrarily or use the existence of
a threat to the peace as a basis for action which . . . is for
collateral and independent purposes, such as the overthrow of a
government or the partition of a State." (Ian Brownlie, The Decisions
of Political Organs of the United Nations and the Rule of Law, in
Essays in Honour of Wang Tieya 95 (1992).)

15.  Support for the view that the Security Council cannot act
arbitrarily or for an ulterior purpose is found in the nature of the
Charter as a treaty delegating certain powers to the United Nations.
In fact, such a limitation is almost a corollary of the principle that
the organs of the United Nations must act in accordance with the
powers delegated them. It is a matter of logic that if the Security
Council acted arbitrarily or for an ulterior purpose it would be
acting outside the purview of the powers delegated to it in the
Charter.

16.  Although it is not for this Trial Chamber to judge the
reasonableness of the acts of the Security Council, it is without
doubt that, with respect to the former Yugoslavia, the Security
Council did not act arbitrarily. To the contrary, the Security
Council's establishment of the International Tribunal represents its
informed judgment, after great deliberation, that violations of
international humanitarian law were occurring in the former Yugoslavia
and that such violations created a threat to the peace. One
commentator has noted the "careful, incremental approach" of the
Security Council to the situation in the former Yugoslavia and
described the establishment of the International Tribunal as a
protracted, four-step process involving: "(I) condemnation; (2)
publication; (3) investigation; and (4) punishment." (James C.
O'Brien, The International Tribunal for Violations of International
Humanitarian Law in the Former Yugoslavia, 87 Am. J. Int'l L. 639,
640-42 (1993).) First, with its resolution 764, adopted on 13 July
1992, the Security Council stressed that ';persons who commit or order
the commission of grave breaches of the [1949 Geneva] Conventions are
individually responsible in respect of such breaches". Second, the
Security Council publicized this condemnation by adopting, on 12
August 1992, resolution 771, which called upon States and other bodies
to submit "substantiated information" to the Secretary-General, who
would report to the Security Council ' recommending additional
measures that might be appropriate . Third, by resolution 780 of 6
October 1992, the Security Council established the Commission of
Experts to investigate these violations of international humanitarian
law. The Security Council in due course received the report of the
Commission of Experts, which concluded that grave breaches of the 1949
Geneva Conventions and other violations of international humanitarian
law had been committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia,
including wilful killing, "ethnic cleansing," mass killings, torture,
rape, pillage and destruction of civilian property, destruction of
cultural and religious property and arbitrary arrests. (See Interim
Report of the Commission of Experts, U.N. Doc. S/25274 (26 January
1993).) Finally, on 22 February 1993, by resolution 808, the Security
Council decided that an international tribunal should be established
and directed the Secretary-General to submit specific proposals for
the implementation of that decision. On 25 May 1993, in resolution
827, the Security Council adopted the draft Statute and thus
established the International Tribunal.

17.  None of the hypothetical cases which commentators have suggested
as examples of limits on the powers of the Security Council, whether
imposed by the terms of the Charter or general principles of
international law and, in particular, jus cogens, have any relevance
to the present case. Moreover, even if there be such limits, that is
not to say that any judicial body, let alone this International
Tribunal, can exercise powers of judicial review to determine whether,
in relation to an exercise by the Security Council of powers under
Chapter VII, those limits have been exceeded.

18.  One may add that in the present case any submission to the
contrary becomes particularly unattractive when, in the notorious
circumstances of the former Yugoslavia, the Security Council has done
no more than take the step of "ameliorating a threat to international
peace and security by providing for the prosecution of individuals who
violate well-established international law.... [something] best
addressed by a judicial remedy". (O'Brien, supra, at 643.)

19.  It is not irrelevant that what the Security Council has enacted
under Chapter VII is the creation of a tribunal whose jurisdiction is
expressly confined to the prosecution of breaches of international
humanitarian law that are beyond any doubt part of customary law, not
the establishment of some eccentric and novel code of conduct or some
wholly irrational criterion as the possession of white hair, as was
instanced in argument by the Defence. Arguments based upon reductio ad
absurdum may be useful to destroy a fallacious proposition but will
seldom provide a firm foundation for the creation of a valid one.

20.  In argument the spectre was raised of interference by the
Security Council in the proceedings of the International Tribunal, for
instance, by the abolition of the International Tribunal, in midstream
as it were, for wholly political reasons. No doubt this would be
within the power of the Security Council, but so too is like action in
a national context. National legislatures, with greater or lesser
ease, depending upon their powers under their respective constitutions
or governing laws, may abolish courts previously created but this in
no way detracts from the status of those courts as entities
established by law.

21.  The Security Council established the International Tribunal as an
enforcement measure under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter
after finding that the violations of international humanitarian law in
the former Yugoslavia constituted a threat to the peace. In making
this finding, the Security Council acted under Article 39 of the
Charter, which provides:

"The Security Council shall determine the existence of any threat to
peace, breach of peace, or act of aggression and shall make
recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance
with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace
and security."

22.  When, in resolution 827, the Security Council stated that it was
"convinced" that, in the ' particular circumstances of the former
Yugoslavia", the establishment of the International Tribunal would
contribute to the restoration and maintenance of peace, the course it
took was novel only in the means adopted but not in the object sought
to be attained. The Security Council has on a number of occasions
addressed humanitarian law issues in the context of threats to the
peace, has called upon States to comply with obligations imposed by
humanitarian law and has on occasion taken steps to ensure such
compliance. It has done so, for example. in relation to Southern
Rhodesia in 1965 and 1966, South Africa in 1977, Lebanon on a number
of occasions in the 1980's, Iran and Iraq in 1987, Iraq again in 1991,
Haiti and Somalia in 1993 and, of course, Rwanda in 1994. In the last
of these, the establishment of the Rwanda Tribunal by the Security
Council followed its finding that the conflict there involved
violations of humanitarian law and was a threat to the peace.

23.  The making of a judgment as to whether there was such an
emergency in the former Yugoslavia as would justify the setting up of
the International Tribunal under Chapter VII is eminently one for the
Security Council and only for it; it is certainly not a justiciable
issue but one involving considerations of high policy and of a
political nature. As to whether the particular measure of establishing
the International Tribunal is, in fact, likely to be conducive to the
restoration of peace and security is, again, pre-eminently a matter
for the Security Council and for it alone and no judicial body,
certainly not this Trial Chamber, can or should review that step.

24.  The concept of non-justiciability, in a national context. has
been described as follows:

"Prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political
question is found a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment
of the issue to a co-ordinate political department; or a lack of
judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or
the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination
of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or the impossibility of
a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack
of the respect due co-ordinate branches of government; or an unusual
need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made;
or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements
by various departments on one question."  

 (Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 217 (1962).)

The validity of the decision of the Security Council to establish the
International Tribunal rests on its finding that the events in the
former Yugoslavia constituted a threat to the peace. This finding is
necessarily fact-based and raises political, nonjusticiable issues. As
noted by Judge Weeramantry, such a decision ' entails a factual and
political judgement and not a legal one". (The Lockerbie decision at
176.) A commentator has agreed, saying that "a threat to international
peace and security is not a fixed standard which can be easily and
automatically applied '. (David L. Johnson, Note, Sanctions and South
Africa, 19 Harv. Int'l L.J. 887, 901 (1978).) The factual and
political nature of an Article 39 determination by the Security
Council makes it inherently inappropriate for any review by this Trial
Chamber.

25.  The Defence contends that there has been a lack of consistency in
the actions of the Security Council. Certainly the International
Tribunal is the first of its kind to be created. However, the fact
that the Security Council has not taken a similar step in other,
earlier cases cannot in itself be of any relevance in determining the
legality of its action in this case.

26.  Article 41 of the Charter provides:

"The Security Council may decide what measures not involving the use
of armed force are to be employed to give effect to its decisions, and
it may call upon the Members of the United Nations to apply such
measures. These may include complete or partial interruption of
economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio,
and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic
relations."

The Article, on its face, does not limit the discretion of the
Security Council to take measures not involving the use of armed
force.

27.  That it was not originally envisaged that an ad hoc judicial
tribunal might be created under Chapter VII, even if that be factually
correct, is nothing to the point. Chapter VII confers very wide powers
upon the Security Council and no good reason has been advanced why
Article 41 should be read as excluding the step, very appropriate in
the circumstances, of creating the International Tribunal to deal with
the notorious situation existing in the former Yugoslavia. This is a
situation clearly suited to adjudication by a tribunal and punishment
of those found guilty of crimes that violate international
humanitarian law. This is not, as the Defence puts it, a question of
the Security Council doing anything it likes; it is a seemingly
entirely appropriate reaction to a situation in which international
peace is clearly endangered.

28.  The Defence argues that the establishment of the International
Tribunal is not a measure contemplated by Article 41 because the
examples included in that Article focus on economic and political
measures, not judicial measures. As the Defence concedes, however, the
list in that Article is not exhaustive. Once again, the decision of
the Security Council in this regard is fraught with fact-based, policy
determinations that make this issue non-justiciable.

29.  Further, the Defence contends that the International Tribunal is
not an appropriate measure under Article 41 because it has failed to
restore peace in the former Yugoslavia. However, the accused is but
the first and, as yet, the only accused to be brought before the
International Tribunal, and it is wholly premature at this initial
stage of its functioning to attempt to assess the effectiveness of the
International Tribunal as a measure to restore peace, even were it the
function of the International Tribunal to do so.

30.  The Security Council discussions on the situation in the former
Yugoslavia suggest two ways in which the International Tribunal would
help in the restoring and maintaining of peace. First, several States
expressed the view that the creation of the International Tribunal
would deter further violations of international humanitarian law. (See
Provisional Verbatim Record, U.N. SCOR, 48th Sess., 3175th mtg. at 8,
22, U.N. Doc. S/PV.3175 (22 February 1993); Provisional Verbatim
Record, U.N. SCOR, 48th Sess., 3217th mtg. at 12, 19, U.N. Doc.
S/PV.3217 (25 May 1993).)

31.  Second, States took the position that the establishment of the
International Tribunal would assist in the restoration of peace in the
region. At the Security Council meeting on resolution 808, Hungary, in
supporting the establishment of the International Tribunal, explained
how the International Tribunal would be helpful in this regard:

"The way the international community deals with questions relating to
the events in the former Yugoslavia will leave a profound mark on the
future of that part of Europe, and beyond. It will make either easier
or more painful, or even impossible, the healing of the psychological
wounds the conflict has inflicted upon peoples who for centuries have
lived together in harmony and good-neighbourliness, regardless of what
we may hear today from certain parties to the conflict. We cannot
forget that the peoples, the ethnic communities and the national
minorities of Central and Eastern Europe are watching us and following
our work with close attention."

(Provisional Verbatim Record of 22 February 1993, supra, at 19-20.)

Slovenia also indicated its conviction that:

"[T]he establishment of such a tribunal is a necessary and very
important step, given the fact that those responsible for such crimes
would be judged by an impartial judicial body as well as the fact that
it could also contribute positively to the finding of solutions for
the restoration of peace in the above-mentioned regions."

(Letter from the Permanent Representative of Slovenia to the United
Nations, to the Secretary-General, U.N. Doc. S/256552 (22 April
1993).)

Similarly, a commentator who has written extensively about the
International Tribunal has stated:

"[I]T is important to try individuals responsible for crimes if there
is to be any real hope of defusing ethnic tensions in this region.
Blame should not rest on an entire nation but should be assigned to
individual perpetrators of crimes and responsible leaders."

(Theodor Meron, Case for War Crimes Trials in Yugoslavia, 72 Foreign
Affairs 122, 134 (1993).)

The Trial Chamber agrees that due to the nature of the conflict, an
adjudicatory body is a particularly appropriate measure to achieve
lasting peace in the former Yugoslavia. In any case. the ultimate
success or failure of the International Tribunal is certainly not an
issue for this Trial Chamber.

32.  Then it iS said that international law requires that criminal
courts be independent and impartial and that no court created by a
political body such as the Security Council can have those
characteristics. Of course, criminal courts worldwide are the
creations of legislatures, eminently political bodies. The Court, in
the Effect of Awards case, specifically held that a political organ of
the United Nations - in that case, the General Assembly - could and
had created ' an independent and truly judicial body". (Effect of
Awards of Compensation Made by the United Nations Administrative
Tribunal, 1954 I.C.I. 47, 53 (Advisory Opinion of 13 July) ( Effect of
Awards").) The question whether a court is independent and impartial
depends not upon the body that creates it but upon its constitution,
its judges and the way in which they function. The International
Tribunal has, as its Statute and Rules attest, been constituted so as
to ensure a fair trial to an accused and it is to be hoped that the
way its Judges administer their jurisdiction will leave no room for
complaints about lack of impartiality or want of independence.

33.  The fact that the Security Council has established an ad hoc
tribunal is also said to reveal invalidity because it is said to deny
to the accused the right conferred by Article 14 of the International
Convention on the Protection of Civil and Political Rights ("ICCPR")
to be tried by a tribunal "established by law". However, on analysis
this introduces no new concept; it is but another way of expressing
the general complaint that the creation of the International Tribunal
was beyond the power of the Security Council.

34. It is noteworthy that, in the context of the International
Covenant and its entitlement in Article 14 to trial by a "tribunal
established by law", this phrase requires only that the tribunal be
legally constituted. At the time Article 14 was being drafted, it was
sought unsuccessfully to amend it to require that tribunals should be
"pre-established". As Professor David Harris puts it in his article
The Right to a Fair Trial in Criminal Proceedings as a Human Right, 16
I.C.L.Q. 353, 356 (1967):

"An amendment which sought to change the wording of the United Nations
text to read 'pre-established' and so cover all ad hoc or special
tribunals was firmly and successfully opposed, however, on the ground
that this would make normal judicial reorganization difficult. Mention
was also made of the Nuremberg and Tokyo Tribunals which were ad hoc
and yet which, it is generally agreed, gave the accused a fair trial
in a procedural sense in most respects. ... the important
consideration is whether a court observes certain other requirements
once it begins to function, however it might be created."

35.  It is also argued that Article 29 of Chapter VI of the Charter
does not contemplate the creation by the Security Council of an
international judicial body when it refers to the creation of
subsidiary organs. The reasoning behind this submission is no more
than an assertion that a judicial body cannot be an additional organ
of some other body; yet Article 29 is expressed in the broadest terms
and nothing appears to limit its scope to nonjudicial organs. In any
event, it is not under Chapter VI of the Charter that the Security
Council has established this Tribunal; as the Statute of the
International Tribunal declares in its opening paragraph, it is as a
measure under Chapter VII that the Security Council has created this
International Tribunal. Moreover, in the Effect of Awards case
mentioned above, the Court specifically decided that the General
Assembly had the power to create an administrative tribunal. (Effect
of Awards case at 56-61.) If the General Assembly has the authority to
create a subsidiary judicial body, then surely the Security Council
can create such a body in the exercise of its wide discretion to act
under Chapter VII.

36.  Nor has any basis been established for denying to the Security
Council the power of indirect imposition of criminal liability upon
individuals through the creation of a tribunal having criminal
jurisdiction. On the contrary, given that the Security Council found
that the threat to the peace posed by the conflict in the former
Yugoslavia arose because of large scale violations of international
humanitarian law committed by individuals, it was both appropriate and
necessary for the Security Council, through the International
Tribunal, to act on individuals in order to address the threat to the
peace. In this regard it is important that when, in its resolutions
731 and 748, the Security Council required the Libyan Government to
surrender the two Libyan nationals who were accused of the Lockerbie
bombing and imposed mandatory commercial and diplomatic sanctions to
obtain Libya's compliance with its decision, it was, in substance,
acting upon individuals, seeking, the extradition and trial of those
Libyan nationals.

37.  Reference was also made to the jus de non evocando, a feature of
a number of national constitutions. But that principle, if it requires
that an accused be tried by the regularly established courts and not
by some special tribunal set up for that particular purpose, has no
application when what is in issue is the exercise by the Security
Council, acting under Chapter VII, of the powers conferred upon it by
the Charter of the United Nations. Of course, this involves some
surrender of sovereignty by the member nations of the United Nations
but that is precisely what was achieved by the adoption of the
Charter. In particular, that was achieved, in the case of action by
the Security Council under Chapter VII, by Article 2(7) of the Charter
and its reference to the application of enforcement measures under
Chapter VII. The same observation applies to the contention that there
is some vice involved in the conferring of primacy upon this Tribunal.
That is no more than a means by which the Security Council seeks to
give effect to the powers conferred upon it by Chapter VII. In any
event it is by no means clear that an individual defendant has
standing to raise this point.

38. The submission that there should have been involvement of the
General Assembly in the creation of the International Tribunal can
only have any meaning if what is suggested is the creation of a
tribunal by means of an amendment of the Charter. If, however, the
International Tribunal can, as seems clear, be created under Chapter
VII, the suggestion of an amendment of the Charter is as unnecessary,
as it is impractical as a measure appropriate by way of a response to
the current situation in the former Yugoslavia.

39. It was claimed on behalf of the accused that he was disadvantaged
by his removal from the jurisdiction of German courts to that of the
International Tribunal since that denied him the opportunity under the
optional Protocol to the ICCPR to have recourse to the Human Rights
Committee to complain about the trial accorded him. No doubt this is
so, since that right does not appear to apply to proceedings before
international tribunals, but that is nothing to the point in any
challenge to the jurisdiction of this Trial Chamber; it can only be
remedied, if remedy is required, by a further Protocol to the ICCPR. A
similar comment applies in the case of the European Convention on
Human Rights, to which the Defence also refers.

40. The foregoing disposes of the various submissions of the Defence
so far as they relate to the legality of the creation of the
International Tribunal, submissions to which the Trial Chamber felt it
proper to refer since the Defence raised them but. many of which, as
stated above, it does not regard as properly open for consideration by
this Trial Chamber since they go, not so much to its jurisdiction, as
to the unreviewable lawfulness of the actions of the Security Council.

B. Primacy of the International Tribunal

41. The Trial Chamber deals next with the Defence argument that the
primacy jurisdiction conferred upon the International Tribunal by
Article 9 (')) finds no basis in international law because the
national courts of Bosnia and Herzegovina or, alternatively, of the
entity known as the Bosnian Serb Republic, have primary jurisdiction
to try the accused. This argument in effect again challenges the
legality of the action of the Security Council in establishing the
International Tribunal: the answer to this has already been provided
above. The Trial Chamber is not entitled to engage in an exercise
involving the review of a resolution passed by the Security Council.
In any event, the accused not being a State lacks the locus standi to
raise the issue of primacy, which involves a plea that the sovereignty
of a State has been violated, a plea only a sovereign State may raise
or waive and a right clearly the accused cannot take over from that
State. (See Israel v. Eichmann, 36 I.L.R. 5, 62 (1961).) In this
regard, it is pertinent to note that the challenge to the primacy of
the International Tribunal has been made against the express intent of
the two States most closely affected by the indictment against the
accused - Bosnia and Herzegovia and the Federal Republic of Germany.
The former, on the territory of which the crimes were allegedly
committed, and the latter where the accused resided at the time of his
arrest, have unconditionally accepted the jurisdiction of the
International Tribunal and the accused cannot claim the rights that
have been specifically waived by the States concerned. To allow the
accused to do so would be to allow him to select the forum of his
choice, contrary to the principles relating to coercive criminal
jurisdiction. As to the entity known as the Bosnian Serb Republic,
similarly, the accused as an individual, has no locus standi, for the
reasons given above, to raise the issue of this entity's sovereignty
rights should it have been endowed with all the attributes of
statehood.

42.  Before leaving this question relating to the violation of the
sovereignty of States, it should be noted that the crimes which the
International Tribunal has been called upon to try arc not crimes of a
purely domestic nature. They are really crimes which are universal in
nature, well recognized in international law as serious breaches of
international humanitarian law. and transcending the interest of any
one State. The Trial Chamber agrees that in such circumstances, the
sovereign rights of States cannot and should not take precedence over
the right of the international community to act appropriately as they
affect the whole of mankind and shock the conscience of all nations of
the world. There can therefore be no objection to an international
tribunal properly constituted trying these crimes on behalf of the
international community

43.  As to the invocation of jus de non evocando, which has been dealt
with above, nothing more need be said except that the Defence has in
no way established that the principle is so universal in application
that it amounts to a peremptory norm of international law which cannot
be breached in any event. Therefore the Trial Chamber proposes to
speak no more of it.

44.  One final word before leaving this topic. The crimes with which
the accused is charged form part of customary international law and
existed well before the establishment of the International Tribunal.
If the Security Council in its informed wisdom, acting well within its
powers pursuant to Article 39 and 41 under Chapter VII of the Charter,
creates the International Tribunal to share the burden of bringing
perpetrators of universal crimes to justice, the Trial Chamber can see
no invasion into a State's jurisdiction because, as it has been
rightly argued on behalf of the Prosecutor, they were never crimes
within the exclusive jurisdiction of any individual State. In any
event, Article 2 (7) of the Charter, as has been noted above,
prohibiting intervention by the United Nations in matters essentially
within a State's domestic jurisdiction, is qualified in that "this
principle shall not prejudice the application of enforcement measures
under Chapter VII".

II. Subject-Matter Jurisdiction                  

45.  The Trial Chamber must turn now to what are truly matters of
jurisdiction. The Defence contends that the charges laid against the
accused do not fall within the subject-matter jurisdiction of this
Tribunal and it is necessary accordingly to examine the limits of that
jurisdiction.

A. Article 2: Grave Breaches of the Geneva Convention of 1919

46.  The Statute of the International Tribunal confers jurisdiction by
Articles I to 8 and supplements, and in one respect qualifies, that
jurisdiction in Articles 9 and 10. However it is essentially Articles
1. 2. 3 and 5 with which this motion is concerned.

47.  Article I does no more than confer power to prosecute for serious
violations of international humanitarian law and confines that power,
spatially, to breaches committed in the territory of the former
Yugoslavia and, temporally, to the period since 1991. It further
requires that the power thus conferred be exercised in accordance with
the provisions of the Statute.

48.  Article 2 confers subject-matter jurisdiction to prosecute in
respect of grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and identifies
those breaches by the phrase, "namely the following acts against
persons or property protected under the provisions of the relevant
Geneva Conventions." There then follows an enumeration of acts, culled
from the four Conventions and, with very slight variations, repeating
and in effect consolidating, the terms of the grave breaches
provisions to be found in varying form in each of those Conventions.

49.  The Article has been so drafted as to be self-contained rather
than referential, save for the identification of the victims of
enumerated acts; that identification and that alone involves going to
the Conventions themselves for the definition of "persons or property
protected." In the present case it is not contended that the alleged
victims in the several charges were not protected persons; in any
event that will be a matter for evidence in due course.

50.  What is contended is that for Article 2 to have any application
there must exist a state of international conflict and that none in
fact existed at any relevant time-or place. However, the requirement
of international conflict does not appear on the face of Article 2.
Certainly, nothing in the words of the Article expressly require its
existence; once one of the specified acts is allegedly committed upon
a protected person the power of the International Tribunal to
prosecute arises if the spatial and temporal requirements of Article 1
are met.

51.  The Report of the Secretary-General, (U.N. Doc. S/25704 (3 May
1993)) (the "Report") makes it clear, in paragraph 34, that it was
intended that the rules of international law that were to be applied
should be "beyond any doubt part of customary law", so that problems
of non-adherence of particular States to any international Convention
should not arise. Hence, no doubt, the specific reference to the law
of the Geneva Conventions in Article 2 since, as the Report states in
paragraph 35, that law applicable in armed conflict has beyond doubt
become part of customary law. But there is no ground for treating
Article 2 as in effect importing into the Statute the whole of the
terms of the Conventions, including the reference in common Article 2
of the Geneva Convention to international conflicts. As stated,
Article 2 of the Statute is on its face, self-contained, save in
relation to the definition of protected persons and things. It simply
confers subject matter jurisdiction to prosecute what, if one were
concerned with the Conventions, would indeed be grave breaches of
those Conventions, but which are, in the present context, simple
enactments of the Statute.

52.  When what is in issue is what the Geneva Conventions contemplate
in the case of grave breaches, namely their prosecution before a
national court and not before an international tribunal, it is natural
enough that there should be a requirement of internationality; a
nation might well view with concern, as an unacceptable infringement
of sovereignty, the action of a foreign court in trying an accused for
grave breaches committed in a conflict internal to that nation. Such
considerations do not apply to the International Tribunal, any more
than do the references in the Conventions to High Contracting Parties
and much else in the Conventions; all these are simply inapplicable to
the International Tribunal. They do not apply because the
International Tribunal is not in fact, applying conventional
international law but, rather, customary international law, as the
Secretary-General makes clear in his Report, and is doing so by virtue
of the mandate conferred upon it by the Security Council. In the case
of what are commonly referred to as "grave breaches", this
conventional law has become customary law, though some of it may well
have been conventional law before being written into the predecessors
of the present Geneva Conventions.

53.  It follows that the element of internationality forms no
jurisdictional criterion of the offences created by Article 2 of the
Statute of the International Tribunal. If it did, there are clear
indications in the great volume of material before the Trial Chamber
that the acts alleged in the indictment were in fact committed in the
course of an international armed conflict. However, little of this
material is such that judicial notice can be taken of it and none of
it is in the form of, nor has it been tendered as, evidence. In these
circumstances the Trial Chamber makes no finding regarding the nature
of the armed conflict in question.

54.  As a submission alternative to its principal submission that
there was here an international armed conflict, the Prosecutor
contended that certain agreements entered into were, in any event,
such that they operated, pursuant to common Article 3 of the 1949
Geneva Conventions ("common Article 3"), "to bring into force, by
means of special agreements", those provisions of the Conventions
relating to serious breaches

55.  Those agreements, entered into under the auspices of the
International Committee of the Red Cross on 22 and 23 May and on 1
October 1992, were accompanied by a programme of action agreed upon on
27 August 1992.

56.  That these agreements had the effect contended for by the
Prosecutor was contested by the Defence. In view of the conclusion of
the Trial Chamber that Article 2 of our Statute expressly and directly
confers jurisdiction to prosecute in respect of the commission of the
acts enumerated in that Article, it is also unnecessary to express any
conclusion regarding this alternative submission.

B. Article 3: Violations of the Laws or Customs of War

57.  The Defence contends that the accused may not be tried for
violations of laws or customs of war under Article 3 of the Statute
because that article is based on the Hague Convention (IV) Respecting
the Laws and Customs of War on Land and the regulations thereto of 18
October 1907 ("Hague Convention"), and the 1977 Protocol I, which
apply only to an international conflict, and that none, in fact,
existed at any relevant time or place. The Prosecutor responds by
asserting that the term "laws or customs of war" in Article 3 applies
to both international and internal conflict and that the International
Tribunal may apply the minimum standards of common Article 3 which are
applicable to both international and internal armed conflicts. Since
the Prosecutor seemingly does not seek to import Protocol I into
Article 3 of the Statute, the Trial Chamber does not address that
issue.

58.  Having considered the position of the parties, the Trial Chamber
finds that the character of the conflict, whether international or
internal, does not affect the subject-matter jurisdiction of the
International Tribunal under Article 3 to try persons who are charged
with violations of laws or customs of war.

59. The interpretation of the scope of Article ,2 of the Statute is
applicable to the view of the Trial Chamber of its subject matter
jurisdiction under Article 3. Contrary to the position of the Defence,
nothing in the words of Article: 3 expressly requires the existence of
an international conflict. Indeed, with respect to Article 3, unlike
Article 2, there is no mention of any convention. Article 3 simply
provides that the International Tribunal ';shall have the power to
prosecute persons violating the laws or customs of war". A list of
prohibitory acts are then set forth in the Article. It is clear that
the list is illustrative and not exhaustive, for the list is preceded
with the phrase, "such violations shall include, but not be limited to
. . ."

60. The competence of the International Tribunal extends to serious
violations of international humanitarian law that are a part of
customary law. International humanitarian law includes international
rules designed to solve humanitarian problems arising from
international or non-international armed conflicts. (See Commentary on
the Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977, at p. XXVII (ICRC 1987).)
Even though the acts enumerated in Article 3 are from the Hague
Convention, the term "laws or customs of war' should not be limited to
international conflicts. Laws or customs of war include prohibitions
of acts committed both in international and internal armed conflicts.
Indeed, common Article 3 is clear evidence that customary
international law limits the conduct of hostilities in internal armed
conflicts. However, unlike contracting parties to treaties, the
International Tribunal is not called upon to apply conventional law
but instead is mandated to apply customary international law.
Therefore, the element of internationality forms no jurisdictional
criterion even if the Hague Convention was originally envisaged by the
Contracting Parties to apply to international conflicts.

61. Violations of the laws or customs of war are commonly referred to
as "war crimes". They can be defined as crimes committed by any person
in violation of recognized obligations under rules derived from
conventional or customary law applicable to the parties to the
conflict. (See L.C. Green, The Contemporary Law of Armed Conflict 276
(1993), ("war crimes are violations of the laws and customs of the law
of armed conflict and are punishable whether committed by combatants
or civilians, including the nationals of neutral states"). See also,
C.H. Bassiouni, A Draft International Criminal Code And Draft Statute
For An International Criminal Tribunal 130 (1987) ("[w]ar crimes
consist of conduct (acts or omissions) which is prohibited by the
rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, conventions
to which the parties to the conflict are Parties, and the recognized
principles and rules of international law of armed conflict").)

62.  In Article 6 (b) of the Charter of the International Military
Tribunal at Nuremberg, war crimes are defined as

"[V]iolations of the laws and customs of war. Such violations shall
include, but not be limited to, murder, ill-treatment or deportation
to slave labor or for any other purpose of civilian population of or
in occupied territory, murder or ill-treatment of prisoners of war or
persons on the seas, killing of hostages, plunder of public or private
property, wanton destructions of cities, towns, or villages, or
devastation not justified by military necessity."

63.  Although the Statute of the International Military Tribunal
limited its competence to the international armed conflict of World
War II, historically laws or customs of war have not been limited by
the nature of the conflict they regulate. The Lieber Code, broadly
recognized as the most famous early example of a national manual
outlining the laws of war for the use of armed forces, and one of the
first attempts to codify the laws of land warfare, was drafted to
regulate the conduct of the United States armed forces during the
American Civil War. (The Lieber Code, Instructions for the Government
of Armies of the United States in the Field by Order of the Secretary
of War, General Orders No. 100, Washington, D.C. (24 April 1863),
reprinted in L. Friedman (ed.) 1 A Documentary History 158 (1972).)
This Code, based on what Lieber regarded as the generally accepted law
of his day, was used as the model for other manuals and greatly
inspired later developments of the laws of war. Indeed, the drafters
of the first proposal for a codification of the ' laws or customs of
war on land" in The Hague, relied heavily on the "Declaration of
Brussels of 1874", which in turn, was strongly influenced by the
Lieber Code. (See F. Kalshoven, Constraints on the Waging of War 13
(1987).) It is also an established principle of customary
international law that the laws of war might become applicable to
non-international armed conflicts of a certain intensity through the
doctrine of "recognition of belligerency". (See, for example, 1956
United States Army Field Manual, which stipulated that "the customary
law of war becomes applicable to civil war upon recognition of the
rebels as belligerents", para. 11a.) Further, even in internal
conflict situations where the recognition of belligerency was
explicitly withheld, it has been recognized that some fundamental
rules of the law of war would nevertheless apply, regardless of
non-recognition of belligerency. (See A. Cassese "The Spanish Civil
War and the Development of Customary Law Concerning Internal Armed
Conflict", in Current Problems of International Law 313 (Cassese, ed.
1975).) Additionally, under the International Law Commission's Draft
Code on Crimes Against The Peace and Security of Mankind, the notion
of "exceptionally serious war crimes", is defined to include certain
conduct and no differentiation is made with respect to whether
committed in the course of an international or non-international armed
conflict. Members of the Security Council are also of the opinion that
the term "laws or customs" is not limited to international armed
conflicts. (See Statements of U.S., U.K. and French representatives to
the Security Council following the adoption of resolution 827, U.N.
Doc. S/PV.3217, 15 (May 25, 1993).)

64. The Trial Chamber concludes that Article 3 of the Statute provides
a non-exhaustive list of acts which fit within the rubric of "laws or
customs of war". The offences that it may consider are not limited to
those contained in the Hague Convention and may arise during an armed
conflict regardless of whether it is international or internal.

65. The Prosecutor affirmatively contends that the minimum standards
contained in common Article 3 are incorporated in Article 3 of the
Statute. The Trial Chamber finds that it has subject-matter
jurisdiction under Article 3 because violations of laws or customs of
war are a part of customary international law over which it has
competence regardless of whether the conflict is international or
national. However, the Trial Chamber considers that it is necessary to
respond to the specific assertion by the Prosecutor that laws or
customs of war include the obligations imposed by common Article 3.
The Trial Chamber finds that common Article 3 imposes obligations that
are within the subject-matter jurisdiction of Article 3 of the Statute
because those obligations are a part of customary international law.
Further, the Trial Chamber finds that violations of these prohibitions
can be enforced against individuals. Imposing criminal responsibility
upon individuals for these violations does not violate the principle
of nullum crimen sine lege.

66.  Common Article 3 prohibits the following acts when committed
against persons taking no active part in the hostilities:

  (a) violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds,
mutilation, cruel treatment and torture;

  (b) taking of hostages;

  (c) outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and
degrading treatment;

  (d) the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions
without previous judgement pronounced by a regularly constituted
court, affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as
indispensable by civilized-people.

67.  For the reasons discussed herein, the acts proscribed by common
Article 3 constitute criminal offences under international law. The
fact that common Article 3 is part of customary international law was
definitively decided by the International Court of Justice in the
Nicaragua case (Military and Paramilitary Activities (Nicar. v.
U.S.)), 1986 I.C.J. 4 (Merits Judgement of 27 June 1986) in which the
Court, applying customary international law, determined that the rules
contained in common Article 3 constitute a "minimum yardstick"
applicable in both international and non-international armed
conflicts, thus finding that these prohibitions are part of customary
international law. As early as 1958 the view was already held that
common Article 3:

". . . merely demands respect for certain rules, which were already
recognised as essential in all civilised countries, and embodied in
the municipal law of the states in question, long before the
Convention was signed.... no government can object to observing, in
its dealings with internal enemies, whatever the nature of the
conflict between it and them, a few essential rules which it in fact
observes daily, under its own laws, even when dealing with common
criminals."

(Commentary on the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1919: [No.] IV
Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in
Time of War 36 (Pictet ed., 1958).)

A more recent commentator notes that ". . . the norms stated in
Article 3(1)(a)-(c) are of such an elementary, ethical character, and
echo so many provisions in other humanitarian and human rights
treaties, that they must be regarded as embodying minimum standards of
-customary law also applicable to non-international armed conflicts."
(Theodor Meron, Human Rights and Humanitarian Norms as Customary Law
35 (1991).) The customary status of common Article 3 is further
supported by statements made by representatives to the Security
Council following the adoption of resolution 827 adopting the Statute
of the International Tribunal. The United States representative
explicitly stated that she considered Article 3 of the Statute to
include common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, and
representatives from the United Kingdom and France made similar
statements. (U.N. Doc. S/PV.3217 (25 May 1993), paras. 11, 15 and 19.)

68.  The fact that acts proscribed by common Article 3 constitute
criminal offences under international law is also evident from the
fact that the acts within common Article 3 are criminal in nature.
They are similar in content to acts prohibited by the grave breaches
provisions, which clearly entail individual criminal liability. In
addition, the type of acts listed in common Article 3 have been found
in the past to result in individual criminal liability. For example,
Article 44 of the Lieber Code supra provided for the prohibition,
criminal responsibility and punishment of persons committing acts
which are of the type that would today fall within common Article 3.
In addition, there have been national trials for individuals charged
with violations similar to common Article 3. (See Jordan Paust, War
Crimes Jurisdiction and Due Process: The Bangladesh Experience 11
Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law 1, 25 (1978).)

69.  The customary international law doctrine of recognition of
belligerency allows for the application to internal conflicts of the
laws applicable to international armed conflict, thus ensuring that
even in a non-international conflict individuals can be held
criminally responsible for violations of the laws and customs of war.
Additionally, some national military manuals and laws emphasise the
criminal nature of acts within common Article 3. For example, the
United States Army regards violations of common Article 3 as
encompassed by the notion of war crimes, thus empowering it to
prosecute captured military personnel for war crimes if they were
accused of breaches of common Article 3. The German Military Manual
describes violations of common Article 3 as "grave breaches of
international humanitarian law," implying that violations of common
Article 3 could form the basis for individual criminal responsibility.
(See Theodor Meron, International Criminalization of Internal
Atrocities, 89 Am. J. Int'l. L. 554, 564-65 (1995).) Further, the
criminal nature of the acts within common Article 3 is evident from
the language of common Article 3 itself, which is clearly prohibitory
and addresses fundamental offences such as murder and torture which
are prohibited in all States:

"Therefore, no person who has committed such acts . . . could claim in
good faith that he/she did not understand that the acts were
prohibited. And the principle nullum crimen is designed to protect a
person only from being punished for an act that he or she reasonably
believed to be lawful when committed." (Id. at 566.)

70.  The individual criminal responsibility of the violator need not
be explicitly stated in a convention for its provisions to entail
individual criminal liability. This is evident from the use of the
Fourth Hague Convention and the 1929 Geneva Prisoners of War
Convention as the basis for prosecutions and convictions at Nuremberg,
despite the fact that neither convention contain any reference to
penal prosecution or individual liability for breaches.

71.  A further indication that the acts proscribed by common Article 3
constitute criminal offences under international law is that, assuming
arguendo that there is no clear obligation to punish or extradite
violators of non-grave breach provisions of the Geneva Conventions,
such as common Article 3, all States have the right to punish those
violators. Therefore, individuals can be prosecuted for the violations
of the acts listed and thus prosecution by the International Tribunal
based on primacy does not violate the ex post facto prohibition. In
addition, in the Nicaragua case, the Court recognised the
applicability of common Article 1 of the Geneva Conventions to
non-international armed conflicts. The requirement in common Article 1
that all Contracting Parties must respect and ensure respect for the
Conventions may entail resort to penal measures.

72.  In his Report, the Secretary-General states that "the application
of the principle nullum crimen sine lege requires that the
International Tribunal should apply rules of international
humanitarian law which are beyond any doubt part of customary law".
(UN Doc. S/25704, para. 34.) Article 15(1) of the ICCPR contains the
prohibition against nullum crimen sine lege, and provides in relevant
part that "[n]o one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on
account of an act or omission which did not constitute a criminal
offence, under national or international law, at the time when it was
committed". As is demonstrated from the above, common Article 3 is
beyond doubt part of customary international law, therefore the
principle of nullum crimen sine lege is not violated by incorporating
the prohibitory norms of common Article 3 in Article 3 of the Statute
of the International Tribunal.

73.  Additional support for the finding that there is no violation of
the principle of nullum crimen sine lege is that by incorporating the
prohibitory norms of common Article 3 into its national law, the
former Yugoslavia has criminalized these offences. (See Art. 125 of
the Criminal Code of the former Yugoslavia, which provides that the
prohibition of war crimes against the civilian population applies to
situations of "war, armed conflict or occupation," irrespective of the
nature of the conflict, thus implying that situations of
non-international armed conflict could be covered.)

74.  For these reasons, the Trial Chamber finds that the character of
the conflict, whether international or internal, does not affect the-
subject-matter jurisdiction of the Tribunal under Article 3. The term
"laws or customs of war", applies to international and internal armed
conflicts. The minimum standards of common Article 3 apply to the
conflict in the former Yugoslavia and the accused's prosecution for
those offences does not violate the principle of nullum crimen sine
lege.

C. Article 5: Crimes Against Humanity

75.  Crimes against humanity have been described by the
Secretary-General in his Report (at paragraph 48) as those inhumane
acts of a very serious nature committed as part of a widespread or
systematic attack against any civilian population on national,
political, ethnic, racial or religious grounds. The Statute then
defines the jurisdiction of the International Tribunal over crimes
against humanity in Article S of the Statute as follows:

"The International Tribunal shall have the power to prosecute persons
responsible for the following crimes when committed in armed conflict,
whether international or internal in character, and directed against
any civilian population:

  (a) murder;  (b) extermination;  (c) enslavement;  (d) deportation; 
(e) imprisonment;  (f) torture;  (g) rape;  (h) persecutions on
political, racial and religious grounds;  (i) other inhumane acts.

76.  There is no question but that crimes against humanity form part
of customary international law. They found expression in Article 6(c)
of the Nuremberg Charter of 8 August 1945, Article II(l)(c) of Law No.
10 of the Control Council for Germany of 20 December 1945 and Article
5(c) of the Tokyo Charter of 26 April 1946, three major documents
promulgated in the aftermath of World War II.

77.  The Defence claims that "the Tribunal only has jurisdiction under
Article 5 of the Statute if it involves crimes that have been
committed in the execution of or in connection with an international
armed conflict." It purports to find authority for this proposition
requiring the existence of an armed conflict of an international
nature in the Nuremberg Charter which, in its definition of crimes
against humanity, spoke of inhumane acts committed "in execution of or
in connection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal .
. ." and in the affirmation given to the principles of international
law recognised by the Charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal and Judgement
of the Tribunal in General Assembly resolution 95(1) of 1948. The
Defence further contends that the broadening of the scope of Article 5
to crimes when committed in armed conflicts of an internal character
offends the nullum crimen principle.

78.  The Trial Chamber does not agree. The nexus in the Nuremberg
Charter between crimes against humanity and the other two categories,
crimes against peace and war crimes, was peculiar to the context of
the Nuremberg Tribunal established specifically "for the just and
prompt trial and punishment of the major war criminals of the European
Axis countries." (Nuremburg Charter, Article l). As some of the crimes
perpetrated by Nazi Germany were of such a heinous nature as to shock
the conscience of mankind, it was decided to include crimes against
humanity in order to enable the International Military Tribunal to try
the major war criminals for the barbarous acts committed against
German Jews, amongst others, who, as German nationals, were outside
the protection of the laws of warfare which only prohibited violations
involving the adversary or enemy populations. (See Antonio Cassese,
International Law in a Divided World para. 169 (1986).)

79.  That no nexus is required in customary international law between
crimes against humanity and crimes against peace or war crimes is
strongly evidenced by subsequent case law. The military tribunal
established under Control Council Law No. 10 stated in the
Einsatzgruppen case that:

"Crimes against humanity are acts committed in the course of wholesale
and systematic violation of life and liberty . . . The International
Military Tribunal, operating under the London Charter, declared that
the Charter's provisions limited the Tribunal to consider only those
crimes against humanity which were committed in the execution of or in
connection with crimes against peace and war crimes. The Allied
Control Council, in its Law No. 10, removed this limitation so that
the present Tribunal has jurisdiction to try all crimes against
humanity as long known and understood under the-general principles of
criminal law." (4 Trials of War Criminals 499).

80.  Further, the Special Rapporteur of the International Law
Commission had this to say:

"First linked to a state of belligerency . . . the concept of crimes
against humanity gradually came to be viewed as autonomous and is
today quite separate from that of war crimes . . . Crimes against
humanity may be committed in time of war or in time of peace; war
crimes can only be committed in time of war."

(Seventh Report on the Draft Code of Crimes Against the Peace and
Security of Mankind, [1989] 2 Yearbook of ILC, U.N. Doc., A/N/CN.
4/SER. A/1986/Add. 1).

81.  Finally, this view that crimes against humanity are autonomous is
confirmed by the opus classicus on international law, Oppenheim's
International Law, where special reference is made to the fact that
crimes against humanity "are now generally regarded as a
self-contained category, without the need for any formal link with war
crimes . . ." (R. Jennings and A. Watts, I Oppenheim's International
Law 966 (1992)).

82.  Even were it arguable that a nexus is required between crimes
against humanity and war crimes, the element of internationality
certainly forms no jurisdictional criterion because, as has been shown
above, war crimes are prohibited under customary international law in
armed conflicts both of an international and internal nature.

83.  In conclusion, the Trial Chamber emphasises that the definition
of Article 5 is in fact more restrictive than the general definition
of crimes against humanity recognised by customary international law.
The inclusion of the nexus with armed conflict in the article imposes
a limitation on the jurisdiction of the International Tribunal and
certainly can in no way offend the nullum crimen principle so as to
bar the International Tribunal from trying the crimes enumerated
therein. Because the language of Article 5 is clear, the crimes
against humanity to be tried in the International Tribunal must have a
nexus with an armed conflict, be it international or internal.

DISPOSITION                                 The foregoing deals with
the several objections to jurisdiction proper raised by the Defence as
well as with the other objections not properly relating to
jurisdiction but which instead put in issue the lawful creation and
competence of the International Tribunal.

   For the foregoing reasons, THE TRIAL CHAMBER, being seized of the
Motion filed bY the Defence, and

PURSUANT TO RULE 72

HEREBY DISMISSES the motion insofar as it relates to primacy
jurisdiction and subject-matter jurisdiction under Articles 2, 3 and 5
and otherwise decides it to be incompetent insofar as it challenges
the establishment of the International Tribunal

HEREBY DENIES the relief sought by the Defence in its Motion on the
Jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

<P>This is the defense's June 2, 1995 response to the prosecutor's motion requesting anonymity for certain witnesses and victims in the Dusko Tadic case. The prosecution wants the war crimes tribunal to withhold identities from the public including the defense. Since many of the witnesses have friends and family in areas controlled by Bosnian Serbs, the prosecution says that witnesses may be intimidated from testifying. The defense supports withholding identities from the public so long as it is privy to such information.</P>

privacy of witnesses. 

Considering the rights of both the accused and each of the witnesses
the Defence is prepared to accept a non-disclosure to the public of
the names of the persons given pseudonyms by the prosecutors office . 

Any measure however that may unnecessarily limit the right of the
accused to examine or have examined witnesses against him without
adequate compensation, should be rejected. 

In the following application all numbers between brackets refer to the
equivalent numbers of the requested orders as set out in the motion of
the Prosecutor. 

 RULINGS REQUESTED

The Defence requests the Trial Chamber to rule as follows: 

I. To admit the requested orders as set out in (1) subject to the
dismissal of the requested order as set out in (11) or otherwise as
the Trial Chamber may deem fit in the interest of the accused.

the obligation of the Prosecutor to make available to the Defence the
name(s), address(es), whereabouts and other identifying data
concerning witness A and/or F and/ or G and/or H and/or I and/or J
and/or K together with the unredacted statement(s) of this/these
person(s) in compliance with Rule 66 of the Rules of Procedure and
Evidence or otherwise as the Trial Chamber may deem fit in the
interest of the accused. 

VII. To admit the requested order as set out in (12) and (13) subject

THE TRIAL CHAMBER


Considering the Application dated 21 April 1995 ("the
Application"), filed by the Prosecutor of the International
Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia ("the
International Tribunal"),

Noting that the Trial Chamber has been designated by the
President of the International Tribunal pursuant to Rule 9
of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence ("the Rules") of the
International Tribunal to determine the Application,

Having read and considered the Application and the Schedule
("the Schedule") annexed thereto,

Having granted leave to the representative of the Government
of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to appear as
amicus curiae, and having read and considered the submission
of such representative,

Having heard both the Prosecutor and the representative of
the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina at
a public sitting held at The Hague on 15 May 1995,

HEREBY ISSUES ITS DECISION.

I - The Application


1. This is an application by Richard J. Goldstone,
Prosecutor of the International Tribunal, made pursuant to
Article 9(2) of the Statute of the International Tribunal in
accordance with Rule 9 (iii) of the Rules. The Application
is for the issue of a formal request from this Trial Chamber
to the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina
for the deferral to the competence of the International
Tribunal of all investigations and criminal proceedings
involving Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic
being conducted by the Government of the Republic of Bosnia
and Herzegovina in the territory of the former Yugoslavia
since 1991, pursuant to Rule 10 of the Rules.

      2. The Prosecutor states, and the Government of the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina has confirmed in both its
written and oral submissions, that it is currently
conducting investigations into war crimes and violations of
the criminal laws of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Criminal proceedings have been instituted by the Government
of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina against Radovan
Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader; Ratko Mladic, the
military commander of the Bosnian Serb armed forces; and
Mico Stanisic, in charge of Bosnian Serb internal affairs,
in respect of alleged war crimes and violations of Articles
141, 142 and 151 of the Criminal Law of the Socialist
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as recognised by the Republic
of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which include genocide, war
crimes against the civilian population, and destruction of
cultural and historic monuments.

      3. Various documents cited in the Prosecutor's
Application and mentioned at the hearing (documents dated 12
June 1992, 17 August 1992, 26 December 1992 and 20 September
1993) indicate that, one, the Higher Public Prosecutor's
Office in Sarajevo submitted a request to the Higher Court
in Sarajevo for the opening of an investigation in respect
of these suspects, and secondly, the District Military
Prosecutor's Office also lodged a request for an
investigation involving the same individuals to a District
Military Court relating to alleged offences which are within
the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The Prosecutor furthermore
stated that contacts between the Ministry of Justice of the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Prosecutor of the
International Tribunal have enabled the investigative steps
regarding the suspects to be outlined. It was confirmed at
the hearing that national arrest warrants have been issued
by the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

      4. The Prosecutor states in the Schedule, and it was
confirmed at the hearing, that he is conducting
investigations into a wide range of violations which are
within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, in particular
genocide, crimes against civilians, and the destruction of
cultural and historical monuments. It was also confirmed at
the hearing that those violations are identical to those in
respect of which investigations are being carried out on
Bosnian territory. A significant focus of these
investigations relates to persons in positions of authority
who are or were responsible for serious violations of
international humanitarian law in the former Yugoslavia. The
Prosecutor's view is that the matter of the individual
criminal responsibility of the three persons in political,
military or police leadership positions must be examined.

       5. The Prosecutor has also initiated an investigation
into the criminal responsibility of Radovan Karadzic, Ratko
Mladic and Mico Stanisic arising out of indictments already
issued by the International Tribunal against various named
individuals for genocide, murder, rape, mistreatment of
civilians, torture, and other offences allegedly committed
in the running of detention camps.

      6. Finally, the Prosecutor mentioned a significant
investigation concerning the prolonged siege of Sarajevo
(including attacks, considered unlawful, against civilian
members of humanitarian organizations, United Nations
peace-keeping forces and humanitarian-aid convoys).

      7. The Prosecutor's investigations place the main
focus on the positions of authority held by the three
suspects who are allegedly guilty of serious violations of
international humanitarian law in the territory of the
former Yugoslavia. In the Schedule the involvement of
Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic is
described, as was confirmed by the representative of the
Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the
hearing, as follows:

';Radovan Karadzic is one of the main architects of the
[Serbian Democratic Party] political programme, involving
extreme nationalist and ethnic policies and objectives.
Radovan Karadzic became the first president of the Bosnian
Serb administration in Pale. The constitution of this
administration provides that the president commands its
armed forces. Radovan Karadzic exercises his power and
control from Pale, a town near Sarajevo. Radovan Karadzic
has acted as and been dealt with internationally as the
president of the Bosnian Serb administration in Pale. In
that capacity, Radovan Karadzic has, inter alia,
participated in international negotiations and has
personally made agreements on such matters as cease-fires
and humanitarian relief that have been implemented.

Ratko Mladic . . . is a career military officer . . . In the
summer of 1991, he was appointed to command the 9th Corps of
the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) in Knin in the Republic of
Croatia. Subsequently, he assumed command of the forces of
the Second Military District of the JNA which effectively
became the Bosnian Serb army. In that capacity he has
negotiated, inter alia, cease-fire and prisoner exchange
agreements that have been implemented.

Mico Stanisic . . . was the first minister of internal
affairs of the Bosnian Serb administration in Pale. In that
capacity, he was, inter alia, responsible for the regular
and special police forces at the regional and local level in
the territory under Bosnian Serb control. It is alleged that
those forces were actively involved in organising a campaign
of terror against the non-Serbian population of Bosnia and
Herzegovina."

      8. The legal basis for these investigations by the
Prosecutor is Article 7 of the Statute of the International
Tribunal concerning individual criminal responsibility, a
concept discussed in paragraphs 55 and 56 of the Report of
the Secretary-General of the United Nations dated 3 May 1993

      9. Notwithstanding that national courts are vested
with concurrent jurisdiction by Article 9 of the Statute of
the International Tribunal, the Prosecutor, relying on Rule
9, is proposing that a formal request be issued to the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, pursuant to Rule 10 of
the Rules, to defer its investigations and criminal
proceedings in respect of Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and
Mico Stanisic, to the competence of the International
Tribunal, and to provide the Prosecutor with all information
concerning its investigations.

     10. The Prosecutor states that the continuation by the
Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina of
investigations similar to those being conducted by the
Prosecutor could have significant implications for those
investigations, as set out in the Schedule.

     11. In particular, the Prosecutor refers to a number of
matters which may have implications for his investigations
or any subsequent prosecutions. Matters involving
significant factual questions include:

(i) witnesses may be exposed to greater risks as their
identities and evidence will already have been made public;

(ii) witnesses may be unwilling or unable to testify for a
second time;

(iii) critical evidence stored in war zones in the Republic
of Bosnia and Herzegovina could be damaged or lost before
use by the International Tribunal;   

(iv) witnesses may become confused as to the scope and
authority of the two investigations;   

(v) the International Tribunal is not a party to the
conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and has a
better ability to obtain evidence worldwide;   

(vi) deferral of these investigations may encourage
Governments and other sources to furnish additional
information to the International Tribunal that has thus far
not been provided.

Those involving significant legal issues include:

(vii) issues relating to the principle of non-bis-in-idem;

(viii) there is the potential inadvertently to create
inconsistent sworn evidence;

(ix) issues relating to possible trials in absentia which
may be held in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina;   

(x) it would be undesirable and not in the interest of
justice if the decisions of a national court and of the
International Tribunal were to conflict.

12. The Government of the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, appearing as amicus curiae, has indicated in
both its written and oral submissions that it does not
oppose the issue of a formal request by the Trial Chamber
for the deferral of all investigations and criminal
proceedings in respect of Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and
Mico Stanisic.


II - Discussion                                            
              

13. Article 8 of the Statute of the International Tribunal
extends its territorial jurisdiction to the territory of the
former Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia, including its land
surface, airspace and territorial waters, beginning on 1
January 1991. Article 9 of the Statute provides as

follows:

"1. The International Tribunal and national courts shall
have concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute persons for
serious violations of international humanitarian law
committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1
January 1991.   

2. The International Tribunal shall have primacy over
national courts. At any stage of the procedure, the
International Tribunal may formally request national courts
to defer to the competence of the International Tribunal in
accordance with the present Statute and the Rules of
Procedure and Evidence of the International Tribunal."

However, the right to primacy can only be exercised on a
formal request to the national court to defer to the
competence of the International Tribunal. The Rules provide
the modus for the exercise of the right.

14. Rule 9 of the Rules provides as follows:

Where it appears to the Prosecutor that in any such
investigations or criminal proceedings instituted in the
courts of any State:

  (i) . . .

  (ii) . . .

  (iii) what is in issue is closely related to, or otherwise
involves, significant factual or legal questions which may
have implications for investigations or prosecutions before
the Tribunal, the Prosecutor may propose to the Trial
Chamber designated by the President that a formal request be
made that such court defer to the competence of the
Tribunal.

15. To comply with the enabling provisions for grant of the
Application, the Prosecutor must therefore establish that:

     (a) national investigations or criminal proceedings
have been instigated by the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina in respect of suspects including Radovan
Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic;      (b)
investigations are currently being conducted by the
Prosecutor into crimes within the jurisdiction of the
International Tribunal, including the individual criminal
responsibilities of persons in political, military and
police leadership positions, including Radovan Karadzic,
Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic;      (c) what is in issue in
the national investigations or criminal proceedings is
closely related to, or otherwise involves, significant
factual or legal questions which may have implications for
the investigations of the Prosecutor and any subsequent
proceedings before the International Tribunal.

16. The Trial Chamber notes that Radovan Karadzic, Ratko
Mladic and Mico       Stanisic are the subject of
investigations instituted by the Government of       the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina into the same alleged
offences being investigated by the Prosecutor and that the
investigations and any criminal proceedings that may be
instituted by the national courts of the Republic of Bosnia
and Herzegovina in respect of the matters listed in
paragraphs 2 and 3 hereof, relate to the same issues. The
Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina does
not contest these points.

     17. The Trial Chamber further notes that the Prosecutor
is investigating a wide range of allegations covering
offences within the competence of the Tribunal including
genocide, offences against civilians and destruction of
cultural and historical monuments and that he is examining
the individual criminal responsibilities of persons in
political, military and police leadership positions,
including Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic.
It does indeed appear from the Application that the three
named persons hold such positions of authority.

     18. A reading of the Schedule clearly supports the
claim that the investigations and proceedings instituted by
the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in
respect of Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic
involve significant factual or legal questions which have an
impact on the investigations instituted by the Prosecutor in
respect of serious violations of international humanitarian
law in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. The Trial
Chamber refers in particular to paragraphs 3 . I and 3.2 of
the Schedule.

     19. These issues are not disputed by the Government of
the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

     20. Consequently, the Trial Chamber is satisfied that
the Prosecutor has shown that the investigations being
carried out by the Prosecutor and by the Government of the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in respect of Radovan
Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic involve the same
alleged crimes, in particular, genocide, offences against
civilians and destruction of cultural and historical
monuments and that the issues in any criminal proceedings
that may be instituted by the Government of the Republic of
Bosnia and Herzegovina in respect of such crimes would
involve significant factual or legal questions which may
have implications for investigation or prosecutions before
the International Tribunal .

     21. The Government of the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina has also made clear its intent to pursue its
investigations of Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico
Stanisic and to proceed to trial in the absence of a formal
request for deferral.

     22. Proceedings in respect of persons in positions of
authority before the International Tribunal derive expressly
from Article 7 of the Statute of the International Tribunal
and more particularly, from paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 thereof.

     23. The punishment for the crimes allegedly committed
by such individuals is also based on the general principles
of international humanitarian law, and derives in particular
from the precedents laid down by Nuremberg and Tokyo;
furthermore, the principle of individual criminal
responsibility of persons in positions of authority has been
reaffirmed in a number of decisions taken by national
courts, and adopted in various national and international
legal instruments.

     24. It follows from the above principle that the
official capacity of an individual even de facto in a
position of authority - whether as military commander,
leader, or as one in government - does not exempt him from
criminal responsibility and would tend to aggravate it; and,
moreover, it is that position of authority which would have
enabled the suspects to plan, instigate, or order the crimes
in respect of which the above-mentioned investigations have
been conducted, or given them the means to prevent the said
crimes, or at the least to punish their perpetrators.

     25. Accordingly, more so than those just carrying out
orders, they would thus undermine international public
order; and therefore the International Tribunal established
by the international community to restore that order is
particularly well-founded to invoke its primacy over
national courts, as acknowledged in Article 9 (2) of the
Statute of the International Tribunal.

     26. The Trial Chamber has already concluded in
paragraph 20 that the Prosecutor has established the grounds
laid down in Rule 9(iii). In addition, the Trial Chamber
notes that the International Tribunal is the appropriate
forum to try the persons responsible for the kinds of crimes
covered by the investigations currently being conducted by
the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in
respect of Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic
and to examine the individual criminal responsibilities of
persons in political, military and police leadership
positions. Indeed, it could be stated that it is one of the
fundamental purposes of the International Tribunal to
exercise its primacy in such cases.

     27. The Trial Chamber is satisfied that deferral of the
investigations and proceedings which are the subject of this
Application is appropriate and, pursuant to Article 9 of the
Statute and Rules 9 and 10, issues a formal request for
deferral to the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina as hereinafter set forth.


III - Decision

THE TRIAL CHAMBER BASED ON THE FOREGOING DETERMINES AS
FOLLOWS:                                                   
  

considering all the matters before it and addressed in the
public hearing, and considering the requirements contained
in Rule 9(iii) of the Rules,

the Trial Chamber consisting of Judge Karibi-Whyte, as
Presiding Judge, Judge Odio Benito and Judge Jorda, being
seized of the Application made by the Prosecutor,

HEREBY GRANTS the said Application,

FORMALLY REQUESTS the Government of the Republic of Bosnia
and Herzegovina, in respect of serious violations of
international humanitarian law over which the International
Tribunal has jurisdiction, as specified in Articles 2 to 5
of the Statute of the International Tribunal, that the
courts of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina defer to
the competence of the International Tribunal in regard to
their investigations and criminal proceedings involving
Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic,

INVITES the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina to take all necessary steps, both legislative
and administrative, to comply with this Formal Request and
to notify the Registrar of the International Tribunal of the
steps taken to comply with this Formal Request, and

REQUESTS that the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina forward to the International Tribunal the
results of its investigations and a copy of the records and
judgment, if any, of its national courts.

The Trial Chamber requests the Registrar of the
International Tribunal to notify the Government of the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina of this its Decision and
Formal Request.

Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia
since 1 January 1991 (referred to respectively as "Statute" and

Mladic and Mico Stanisic, the Tribunal requests that the Government of
the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina forward to the Tribunal the

judgments, if any. 

III. I make this proposal for the following reasons: 

A) National investigations and criminal proceedings have been
instituted against Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic by
the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina for crimes

Prosecutor 


SCHEDULE

1. INVESTIGATIONS BEING CONDUCTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF
BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA 

1.1. The Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been
conducting investigations into war crimes and violations of the
Criminal Law of the Republic, including genocide, war crimes against
the civilian population and destruction of cultural and historical
monuments. A number of persons are named in these investigations,
including Radovan Karadzic, the president of the Bosnian Serb
administration in Pale; Ratko Mladic, the military commander of the
Bosnian Serb armed forces; and Mico Stanisic, the former minister of
internal affairs of that administration. 

1.2. By a document dated 12 June 1992, the Higher Public Prosecutor's
Office in Sarajevo submitted a request to the Investigating Judge of
the Higher Court in Sarajevo for the opening of an investigation in
respect of a number of named suspects including Radovan Karadzic,
Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic. In a decision dated 16 June 1992, the
Investigating Judge of the Higher Court in Sarajevo granted the Higher
Public Prosecutor's request. 

1.3. By a document dated 17 August 1992, the Higher Public
Prosecutor's Office in Sarajevo applied to the Investigating Judge of
the Higher Court in Sarajevo to widen the investigation in regard to
certain named suspects including Radovan Karadzic. In a decision dated
3 September 1992, the Investigating Judge of the Higher Court granted
the Higher Public Prosecutor's request. 

1.4. A further document, entitled "Request for Investigation" and
dated 26 December 1992, was lodged by the District Military Prosecutor
in Sarajevo with the District Military Court in Sarajevo. Both Radovan
Karadzic and Ratko Mladic are named in this document. Allegations set
out in the request for investigation relate to offences which are
within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. In a decision dated 18
January 1993, the District Military Court granted the District
Military Prosecutor's request. 

1.5. By a document dated 20 September 1993, a formal request to widen
the investigation against Ratko Mladic was made to the District
Military Court by the District Military Prosecutor in Sarajevo. In a
decision dated 3 September 1994, the District Military Court granted
the District Military Prosecutor's request. 

1.6. By letter dated 12 December 1994, the Minister of Justice of the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Sarajevo wrote to the Prosecutor
of the Tribunal ("Prosecutor") outlining the investigative steps taken
with regard to the suspects, alleging genocide and enumerating
supporting documentation for criminal cases against both Radovan
Karadzic and Ratko Mladic. The Minister of Justice stated therein that
national warrants of arrest had been issued for Radovan Karadzic and
Ratko Mladic for the purposes of investigation. A similar warrant has
been issued for Mico Stanisic. 

2. INVESTIGATIONS BY THE PROSECUTOR

2.1. The Prosecutor is investigating allegations of serious violations
of international humanitarian law that occurred in the territory of
the former Yugoslavia as set forth in Articles 2 to 5 of the Statute. 

2.2. A significant focus of the investigations of the Prosecutor
relates to persons in positions of authority who are or were
responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law
in the former Yugoslavia. 

2.3 . Paragraphs 55 and 56 of the Report of the Secretary General of
the United Nations pursuant to paragraph 2 of Security Council
Resolution 808 ( 1993) refer to the issue of criminal responsibility
of persons in positions of superior authority. Paragraphs 55 and 56
state: 

"55. Virtually all of the written comments received by the
Secretary-General have suggested that the statute of the International
Tribunal should contain provisions with regard to the individual
criminal responsibility of heads of State, government officials and
persons acting in an official capacity. These suggestions draw upon
the precedents following the Second World War. The Statute should,
therefore, contain provisions which specify that a plea of head of
State immunity or that an act was committed in the official capacity
of the accused will not constitute a defence, nor will it mitigate
punishment. 

"56. A person in a position of superior authority should, therefore,
be held individually responsible for giving the unlawful order to
commit a crime under the present statute. But he should also be held
responsible for failure to prevent a crime or to deter the unlawful
behavior of his subordinates. This imputed responsibility or criminal
negligence is engaged if the person in superior authority knew or had
reason to know that his subordinates were about to commit or had
committed crimes and yet failed to take the necessary and reasonable
steps to prevent or repress the commission of such crimes or to punish
those who had committed them." 

2.4. Article 7 of the Statute provides:

"7.1 A person who planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise
aided and abetted in the planning, preparation or execution of a crime
referred to in articles 2 to 5 of the present Statute, shall be
individually responsible for the crime. 

"7.2 The official position of any accused person, whether as Head of
State or Government or as a responsible Government official, shall not
relieve such person of criminal responsibility nor mitigate
punishment. 

"7.3 The fact that any of the acts referred to in articles 2 to 5 of
the present Statute was committed by a subordinate does not relieve
his superior of criminal responsibility if he knew or had reason to
know that the subordinate was about to commit such acts or had done so
and the superior failed to take the necessary and reasonable measures
to prevent such acts or to punish the perpetrators thereof. 

"7.4 The fact that an accused person acted pursuant to an order of a
Government or of a superior shall not relieve him of criminal
responsibility, but may be considered in mitigation of punishment if
the International Tribunal determines that justice so requires." 

2.5. Insofar as investigations referred to in paragraph 2.2 relate to
the leadership of the Bosnian Serb administration in Pale, the alleged
criminal responsibility of Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico
Stanisic are central. 

2.5.1. Radovan Karadzic was born on 19 June 1945 in the Municipality
of Savnik of the Republic of Montenegro. He is by profession a
psychiatrist who worked in the Neuro-psychiatric Clinic of the
University Medical Centre in Sarajevo. He was a founding member and
president of the Serbian Democratic Party of what was then the
Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. After the first multi-
party elections in the Republic, Radovan Karadzic emerged as the
leader of the dominant political party among the Bosnian Serbs and
played an active part in the national political life of the country,
emphasising Serbian nationalist sentiments. Radovan Karadzic is one of
the main architects of that party's political programme involving
extreme nationalist and ethnic policies and objectives. Radovan
Karadzic became the first president of the Bosnian Serb administration
in Pale. The constitution of this administration provides that the
president commands its armed forces. Radovan Karadzic exercises his
power and control from Pale, a town near Sarajevo. Radovan Karadzic
has acted as and been dealt with internationally as the president of
the Bosnian Serb administration in Pale. In that capacity, Radovan
Karadzic has, inter alia, participated in international negotiations
and has personally made agreements on such matters as cease-fires and
humanitarian relief that have been implemented. 

2.5.2. Ratko Mladic was born in 1943 in the Kalinovik Municipality of
the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He is a career military
officer and gained his first command in 1965.   In the summer of 1991,
he was appointed to command the 9th Corps of the Yugoslav People's
Army (JNA) in Knin in the Republic of Croatia. Subsequently, he
assumed command of the forces of the Second Military District of the
JNA which effectively became the Bosnian Serb army. In that capacity
he has negotiated, inter alia, cease-fire and prisoner exchange
agreements that have been implemented. 

2.5.3. Through, inter alia, international media reports, reports of
governments and non-governmental organizations and through reports and
resolutions of the United Nations and other international
organizations, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic have been repeatedly
apprised of violations of international humanitarian law allegedly
committed by forces under their control. 

2.5.4 Mico Stanisic was born on 30 June 1954 near Pale in the Republic
of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was the first minister of internal
affairs of the Bosnian Serb administration in Pale. In that capacity,
he was, inter alia, responsible for the regular and special police
forces at the regional and local level in the territory under Bosnian
Serb control. It is alleged that those forces were actively involved
in organising a campaign of terror against the non- Serbian population
of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 

2.6. The Prosecutor is investigating a wide range of allegations
covering offences within the competence of the Tribunal including
genocide, offences against civilians and destruction of cultural and
historical monuments, that is, the same offences being investigated by
the authorities of the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. In all of these investigations, the Prosecutor is
examining the individual criminal responsibilities of persons in
political, military and police leadership positions, including Radovan
Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic. 

2.7. The Prosecutor has issued indictments against other individuals
for genocide, murder, rape, mistreatment of civilians, torture, and
other offences arising from the operation of detention camps and from
attacks on unarmed civilians. Arising out of these indictments, the
Prosecutor is further examining the individual criminal
responsibilities for those crimes of persons in leadership positions,
including Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic. 

2.8. One significant investigation being undertaken by the Prosecutor
relates to the protracted siege of Sarajevo where allegations include
past and continuing unlawful shelling and sniping of civilians. As a
result, many thousands of civilians have been killed and injured.
Non-military buildings such as hospitals and cultural structures have
also been unlawfully targeted. In particular, the Prosecutor is
investigating the alleged systematic sniping campaign against innocent
civilians, including the elderly and young children, the commission of
sexual assaults, as well as other attacks on civilians (e.g. whilst
travelling in trams, standing in bread lines and attending funerals).
Other offences alleged relate to unlawful attacks upon civilian
members of humanitarian agencies and the United Nations peacekeeping
forces, humanitarian aid convoys and aircraft at Sarajevo airport. In
the Sarajevo investigation, the Prosecutor is also examining the
individual responsibilities of persons in leadership positions, in
particular Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic. 

3. SIGNIFICANT FACTUAL AND LEGAL QUESTIONS 

3.1. If the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina
continues investigations which are similar to those being conducted by
the Prosecutor, significant risks are created which may have
implications for investigations before the Tribunal, including, but
not limited to: 

3.1.1 Confusion amongst witnesses and cooperating organizations or
governments concerning the scope and authority of the different
investigations and the different rules and confidentiality protections
which govern the two investigations; 

3.1.2. Creation of an undue burden on witnesses who are interviewed on
multiple occasions; some witnesses, especially those who have suffered
trauma and those who are at physical risk as a result of their
cooperation, may be unwilling or unable to cooperate fully and
effectively with multiple investigations; 

3.1.3. Unnecessarily compromising the credibility of witnesses due to
the inadvertent creation of multiple statements where the statements
were taken under different conditions, in different languages and for
different purposes; 

3.1.4. Potential evidentiary problems resulting from different
procedures such as those concerning evidence collection and
preservation, the taking of statements and the questioning of
suspects; 

3.1.5. The Tribunal is neither a party to the armed conflict nor is it
constrained by national boundaries and therefore is better able to
obtain witness assistance and evidence worldwide; 

3.1.6. A deferral of the investigations of Radovan Karadzic, Ratko
Mladic and Mico Stanisic is likely to encourage governments,
non-govermnental organizations and other sources to furnish to the
Tribunal additional information. 

3.2. If the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina
proceeds to trial before the Prosecutor completes his investigation,
the following significant factual and legal issues may have
implications for investigations and prosecutions before the Tribunal- 

3.2.1. If Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic stand trial
in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina issues relating to the
principle of non-bis-in-idem, pursuant to Article 10(2) of the
Statute, may arise. 

3.2.2. Critical witnesses who have testified in a public national
trial and who will be needed for a trial before the Tribunal will be
exposed to greater risk as their identities and evidence have been
made public; 

3.2.3. Witnesses may be reluctant or unwilling to testify, or at the
least significantly inconvenienced, if required to testify in a second
trial; 

3.2.4. There is a potential of inadvertently creating inconsistent
sworn evidence; 

3.2.S. Critical evidence stored and preserved for trial in war zones
in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, including Sarajevo, could
be damaged or lost for use before the Tribunal; 

3.2.6.  International publicity which would result from a trial in
absentia or otherwise in a national court may create a perception of
prejudice in the minds of the accused or the public and may have
implications for a fur trial before the Tribunal; 

3.2.7. The legal precedents created and the findings of fact made by a
national court and the Tribunal in regard to Radovan Karadzic, Ratko
Mladic and Mico Stanisic, if in conflict, will be undesirable and not
in the interest of justice. 

4. OTHER RELEVANT CONSIDERATIONS

4.1. The Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina has
proposed that its investigations of Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and
Mico Stanisic be deferred to the Tribunal; 

4.2. The Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina
considers it more reasonable that the Prosecutor take over the
investigations because it is in a better position to approach
witnesses living in other countries and to conduct interviews outside
the borders of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina; 

4.3 Given that many witnesses critical to the Prosecutor's
investigation are outside of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina
and may be reluctant to return/travel to a war zone to testify in a
national trial, the Prosecutor is better able to collect evidence
during investigations and present it in trials before the Tribunal; 

4.4 If the deferral request is not granted, the Government of the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina will continue its investigations
and will commence a trial in absentia or otherwise, in accordance with
its laws, against Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic. 


/s/Richard J. Goldstone
Prosecutor

Dated this 21st day of April 1995
The Hague,
The Netherlands

------------------------------------------------------- 


APPLICATION BY THE PROSECUTOR FOR A FORMAL REQUEST FOR DEFERRAL BY THE
GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA OF ITS
INVESTIGATIONS AND CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS IN THE MATTERS OF RADOVAN
KARADZIC, RATKO MLADIC AND MICO STANISIC. 

SUBMISSIONS BY THE PROSECUTION

INTRODUCTION

1. Last week this Tribunal's other Trial Chamber granted an
application by the Prosecutor relating to the deferral by the
Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina of its
investigations and prosecutions into alleged crimes committed by
Bosnian Croat forces against the civilian population of the Lasva
River Valley in Central Bosnia. 

2. The present application before this Trial Chamber is a proposal by
the Prosecutor of this Tribunal for the Government of the Republic of
Bosnia and Herzegovina to defer other investigations and prosecutions
to the Tribunal. On this occasion the Prosecutor is seeking to have
the Bosnian Government's investigations into the alleged criminal
activities of Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic
transferred to the Tribunal. 

3. This particular deferral application is in conformity with the
Prosecutor's policy to investigate the individual criminal
responsibility of persons in positions of superior authority and
control. This policy includes the investigation of individuals who
gave the unlawful orders to commit crimes over which this Tribunal has
jurisdiction. The policy also includes the investigation of
criminality based on doctrine of command responsibility, which in the
context of this case, refers to the investigation of persons in
positions of superior authority who fail or failed to prevent the
criminal behaviour or to deter the unlawful behaviour of their
subordinates. This imputed responsibility applies if the person in
superior authority knew or had reason to know that his subordinates
were about to commit or had committed crimes and yet failed to take
the necessary and reasonable steps to prevent the commission of such
crimes or to punish those who had committed them. 

THE PROSECUTOR'S INVESTIGATION

4. When the Office of the Prosecutor became operational in mid-1994, a
significant focus of the initial investigations involved persons in
positions of authority who were responsible for serious violations of
international humanitarian law in the former Yugoslavia. This is still
the current situation and will continue to be the case.  

5. In relation to allegations that such serious violations have been
committed by Bosnian Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the
investigations by the Office of the Prosecutor have concentrated on
the individual criminal responsibility of the leadership of the
Bosnian Serb administration in Pale.  

6. In relation to these investigations the Prosecutor is investigating
a wide range of allegations covering offences within the competence of
the Tribunal including genocide, serious offences against civilians
such as murder, rape, torture and other acts of cruelty as well as the
destruction of cultural and historical property and monuments. These
same offences are also being investigated by the authorities of the
Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but I will deal
with that issue later in these submissions. In all of the Tribunal's
investigations involving allegations against Bosnian Serbs, the
alleged criminal responsibility of Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic
has been a central focus from the outset and in more recent times the
investigations have included Mico Stanisic. 

7. The Prosecutor has already issued indictments against other
individuals for genocide, murder, rape, mistreatment of civilians,
torture, and other offences arising from the operation of detention
camps and from attacks on unnamed civilians. In relation to these
indictments, the Prosecutor is further examining the individual
criminal responsibilities for those crimes of persons in leadership
positions, including Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic.
 

8. One significant investigation being undertaken by the Prosecutor,
but which at this stage has not resulted in the issue of indictments,
relates to the protracted siege of Sarajevo where allegations include
past and continuing unlawful shelling and sniping incidents. As a
result of such incidents, many thousands of civilians have been killed
and injured. Non-military buildings such as hospitals and cultural
structures have also been unlawfully targeted. In particular, the
Prosecutor is investigating the alleged deliberate and systematic
sniping campaign directed against the civilian population, including
the elderly and young children, as well as the commission of sexual
assaults, other attacks on civilians (e.g. whilst travelling in trams,
standing in bread lines and attending funerals). Other alleged
offences being investigated by the Prosecutor relate to unlawful
attacks upon members of humanitarian agencies, the United Nations
peacekeeping forces, humanitarian aid convoys and manned aircraft at
Sarajevo airport. In the Sarajevo investigation, the Prosecutor is
examining the individual responsibility of persons in leadership
positions, in particular Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic. 


THE CASE INVOLVING RADOVAN KARADZIC

9. It is stated in the schedule attached to the Prosecutor's
application that ' Radovan Karadzic was born on 19 June 1945 in the
Municipality of Savnik of the Republic of Montenegro. He is by
profession a psychiatrist who worked in the Neuro-psychiatric Clinic
of the University Medical Centre in Sarajevo. He was a founding
member, and president, of the Serbian Democratic Party of what was
then the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. After the first
multi-party elections in the Republic, Radovan Karadzic emerged as the
leader of the dominant political party among the Bosnian Serbs and
played an active part in the national political life of the country,
emphasising Serbian nationalist sentiments. Radovan Karadzic is one of
the main architects of that party's political programme involving
extreme nationalist and ethnic policies and objectives. Radovan
Karadzic became the first president of the Bosnian Serb administration
in Pale. The constitution of this administration provides that the
president commands its armed forces. Radovan Karadzic exercises his
power and control from Pale, a town near Sarajevo. Radovan Karadzic
has acted as, and has been dealt with internationally as, the
president of the Bosnian Serb administration in Pale. In that
capacity, Radovan Karadzic has, amongst other things, participated in
international negotiations and has personally made agreements on such
matters as cease-fires and humanitarian relief that have been
implemented." 

THE CASE INVOLVING RATKO MLADIC

10. In relation to the suspect Ratko Mladic, he was born in 1943 in
the Kalinovik Municipality of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
He is a career military officer and gained his first command in 1965.
In the summer of 1991, he was appointed to command the 9th Corps of
the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) in Knin in the Republic of Croatia.
Subsequently, he assumed command of the forces of the Second Military
District of the JNA which effectively became the Bosnian Serb army. In
that capacity he has negotiated, among other things, cease-fire and
prisoner exchange agreements that have in fact been implemented.  

11. Both Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic have been apprised
repeatedly, through international media reports, reports of
governments and non-governmental organizations and through reports and
resolutions of the United Nations and other international
organizations, of criminal acts amounting to violations of
international humanitarian law allegedly committed by forces under
their control. Part of the Prosecutor's investigations involves the
apparent failure of these two suspects to take the necessary and
reasonable steps to prevent or repress the commission of such crimes
or to punish those who have committed them. 

THE CASE INVOLVING MICO STANISIC

12. The third suspect named in the Prosecutor's application, Mico
Stanisic, was born on 30 June 1954 near Pale in the Republic of Bosnia
and Herzegovina,. He was the first minister of internal affairs of the
Bosnian Serb administration in Pale and in that capacity, he was
responsible for the regular and special police forces at both the
regional and local level in the territory which was under Bosnian Serb
control. The Prosecutor's investigations involve allegations that
those police forces were actively involved in organising a campaign of
terror against the non- Serbian population of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 


THE INVESTIGATIONS BEING CONDUCTED BY THE BOSNIAN GOVERNMENT 


13. The schedule attached to the Prosecutor's application in this
matter sets out the nature of the investigations being conducted by
the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina which
involves investigations into war crimes and violations of the Criminal
Law of the Republic, including genocide, war crimes against the
civilian population and the destruction of cultural and historical
monuments. A number of persons are named in these investigations,
including Radovan Karadzic, the president of the Bosnian Serb
administration in Pale; Ratko Mladic, the military commander of the
Bosnian Serb armed forces; and Mico Stanisic, the former minister of
internal affairs of that administration. National warrants of arrest
have been issued in respect of these named suspects, which authorise
the detention of the suspects in custody for a period of one month to
enable the Bosnian government's investigations to continue. 

REASONS IN SUPPORT OF THE APPLICATION:

14. I would now like to address the Trial Chamber in relation to the
reasons for the  present application. National investigations and
criminal proceedings have been instituted against Radovan Karadzic,
Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic by the  Government of the Republic of
Bosnia and Herzegovina for crimes alleged to have  taken place in its
territory. These national investigations and criminal proceedings 
involve issues closely related to, or otherwise involve, significant
factual or legal  questions which may have implications for
investigations or prosecutions before the Tribunal.  

15. The Prosecutor of this Tribunal is currently conducting
investigations into  crimes within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal
that have taken place within the  territory of the Republic of Bosnia
and Herzegovina in which Radovan Karadzic,  Ratko Mladic and Mico
Stanisic are suspects.  

16. The Minister of Justice of the Bosnian Government has proposed, in
a letter  dated 12 December 1994, that the Tribunal take over the
investigation of Radovan  Karadzic and Ratko Mladic. Further, in their
written submissions, which were  filed with the Registrar of this
Tribunal on Monday 8 May 1995, the Bosnian  Government has again
proposed that its investigations be deferred to the Tribunal.  stating
that it does not oppose the issue of a formal request for the deferral
of all investigations and criminal proceedings in respect of Radovan
Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic.  

17. It is stated in paragraph 11 of those written submission of the
Government of  the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that in the
absence of a formal request for deferral that Government intends to
pursue its investigations of Radovan Karadzic,  Ratko Mladic and Mico
Stanisic and will proceed to trial. It is submitted that from  the
Tribunal's point of view this would be undesirable and not in the
interest of justice. 

18. In any event, it is submitted that this Tribunal is the proper
forum to try the  suspects nominated in the present application,
particularly having regard to the gravity of the crimes under
investigation by the Prosecutor. 


19. The Prosecutor of this Tribunal is in a better position to
approach witnesses  living in other countries and to conduct
interviews outside the borders of the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina and this is an additional reason for a deferral  in this
case.  

20. It is submitted that a related reason for granting the present
application is that many of the important witnesses who are located
outside the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina may be reluctant to
return or travel to Bosnia and Herzegovina to  testify in a national
trial, and accordingly the Office of the Prosecutor is in a better
position to collect evidence and to complete the investigations and to
present that  evidence before the Tribunal.  

21. Further, it is submitted that the deferral of the Bosnian
Government's -  investigation in respect of Radovan Karadzic, Ratko
Mladic and Mico Stanisic is  likely to encourage or enable
governments, non-governmental agencies, and other  sources to furnish
evidence and information to the Tribunal that thus far has not  been
provided. Following the announcement of the two deferral applications
the attitude of some governments and non-governmental organisations
have become  more positive towards the Tribunal. 

IMPLICATIONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL IF THE BOSNIAN GOVERNMENT'S
INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS PROCEED: 

22.    There are several significant implications for the
investigations being  undertaken by the Office of the Prosecutor and
any subsequent proceedings before  the Tribunal if the Government of
the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina  continues investigations which
are similar to those being conducted by the Office  of the Prosecutor.
In this regard it is submitted that the Prosecutor's investigations 
which have not been completed could be severely and significantly
prejudiced if  the investigations and prosecutions being undertaken by
the Bosnian Government continue. 

23. First, it is likely that considerable confusion may result amongst
witnesses  and cooperating organisations or governments concerning the
scope and authority  of parallel investigations being undertaken by
the Tribunal and the Bosnian  Government. In this regard there are
different rules and confidentiality protections  which govern the two
investigations. Of greater concern, however, is the undue burden which
is placed on witnesses who are interviewed by different investigating 
bodies, on different occasions, and the resulting possibility of
compromising the  credibility of witnesses due to the inadvertent
creation of multiple statements. It is  relevant to mention in this
regard that almost all of the statements taken by the  Office of the
Prosecutor require the services of interpreters, and this is an added 
circumstance which could bring about apparent inconsistencies between
statements  taken by the Prosecutor's investigators on the one hand
and by the Bosnian  investigators on the other. This burden on
witnesses who are interviewed on  multiple occasions is particularly
relevant to witnesses who have suffered trauma and who may be at
physical risk as a result of their cooperation. Witnesses faced  with
these burdens could in fact refuse to cooperate with any investigating
body. 

24. Secondly, separate investigations are likely to lead to
evidentiary problems  which may result from different investigative
procedures such as those concerning the collection and preservation of
evidence, the taking of statements and the  questioning of suspects. 

25. Thirdly, if the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina  proceeds to trial before our investigations are completed
it is likely that there may be a number of legal issues which could
have implications for our investigations and any prosecutions before
the Tribunal. These legal implications were also raised in last week's
deferral application by the Prosecutor and they include the principle
of non-bis-in-idem, which may arise, pursuant to Article 10(2) of the
Statute of the Tribunal, if Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico
Stanisic stand trial in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  

26. Fourth, if the persons nominated as suspects in this application
are tried in  absentia, in the courts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, there
may be legal implications  for the Tribunal by reasons of the fact
that crucial witnesses, who will be required  to testify before the
Tribunal, will be exposed to greater risks if their identities and 
the evidence they can give has already been made public in a public
national trial.  

27. Fifthly, witnesses may be reluctant, or at least significantly
inconvenienced, if  required to testify in a subsequent trial before
this Tribunal after they have already  given evidence before a
national court.  

28. Further there may also be a risk that important evidence, which is
being  retained for use in a trial in a national court in a war zone
within the Republic of  Bosnia and Herzegovina, could be damaged or
destroyed before it can be secured  for use before the Tribunal.  

29. Finally, international publicity which would result from a trial
in absentia or otherwise in a national court may create a perception
of prejudice in the minds of the accused or the public and may have
implications for a fair trial before the Tribunal. 

CLOSING SUBMISSIONS AND FORM OF ORDER SOUGHT:  

30. I submit, on behalf of the Prosecutor, that the present
application is in full compliance with the provisions of the
Tribunal's Statute and Rules and that the national investigations and
criminal proceedings in question involve issues closely related to, or
otherwise involve, significant factual or legal questions which may
have implications for investigations or prosecutions before the
Tribunal.  

31. If your Honours are satisfied that a deferral in relation to this
present application is appropriate, having regard to the matters that
have been submitted on behalf of the Prosecutor, then pursuant to Rule
10 of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure and Evidence, we propose that
the Trial Chamber issue a formal request to the Government of the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the following terms namely:    

(A) In respect of serious violations of international humanitarian law
over which this Tribunal has jurisdiction, as specified in Articles 2,
3, 4 and 5 of the Tribunal's Statute, that the courts of the Republic
of Bosnia and Herzegovina defer to the competence of the Tribunal in
regard to their investigations and criminal proceedings involving
Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Mico Stanisic; and    

(B) In regard to all such investigations of Radovan Karadzic, Ratko
Mladic and Mico Stanisic, the Tribunal requests that the Government of
the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina forward to the Tribunal the
results of the said investigations and copies of the court's records
and judgments, if any.

requirements of the detention unit, the authorized methods of seeking
information and making complaints, and all other matters necessary to
enable him to understand both his rights and obligations and to adapt
himself to the routine of the detention unit. 

59. At any time at which there is a detainee in the detention unit who
speaks and understands neither of the working languages of the
Tribunal nor that spoken by any of the staff of the detention unit,

reasonable notice and, in any event, in cases of emergency, to permit
the detainee to communicate freely with the staff and administration
of the detention unit. 


RIGHTS OF DETAINEES


Communications and visits

60. Subject to the provisions of Rule 66, detainees shall be entitled,
under such conditions of supervision and time-restraints as the
Commanding Officer deems necessary, to communicate with their families
and other persons with whom it is in their legitimate interest to
correspond by letter and by telephone at their own expense. In the
case of an indigent detainee, the Registrar may agree that the
Tribunal will bear such expenses within reason. 

61. All correspondence and mail, including packages, shall be
inspected for explosives or other irregular material. The Commanding
Officer, in consultation with the Registrar, shall lay down conditions
as to the inspection of correspondence, mail and packages in the
interests of maintaining order in the detention unit and to obviate
the danger of escape. 

62. A detainee shall be informed at once of the death or serious
illness of any near relative. 

63. Detainees shall be entitled to receive visits from family, friends
and others, subject only to the provisions of Rule 66 and to such
restrictions and supervision as the Commanding Officer, in
consultation with the Registrar, may impose. Such restrictions and
supervision must be necessary in the interests of the administration
of justice or the security and good order of the host prison and the
detention unit. All visitors must also comply with the separate
requirements of the visiting regime of the host prison. These
restrictions may include personal searches of clothing and X-ray
examination of possessions on entry to either or both of the detention
unit and the host prison. Any person, including defence counsel for a
detainee or a diplomatic or consular representative accredited to the
Host State, who refuses to comply with such requirements, whether of
the detention unit or of the host prison, may be refused access. 

64. A detainee must be informed of the identity of each visitor and
may refuse to see any visitor other than a representative of the
Prosecutor. 

65. Detainees shall be allowed to communicate with and receive visits
from the diplomatic and consular representative accredited to the Host
State of the State to which they belong or, in the case of detainees
who are without diplomatic or consular representation in the Host
State and refugees or stateless persons, with the diplomatic
representative accredited to the Host State of the State which takes
charge of their interests or of a national or international authority
whose task it is to serve the interests of such persons. 

66. The Prosecutor may request the Registrar or, in cases of
emergency, the Commanding Officer, to prohibit contact between a
detainee and any other person if he has reasonable grounds for
believing that such contact is for the purposes of attempting to
arrange the escape of the detainee from the detention unit, or could
prejudice or otherwise affect the outcome of the proceedings against
the detainee, or of any other investigation, or that such contact
could be harmful to the detainee or any other person. If the request
is made to the Commanding Officer on grounds of urgency, the
Prosecutor shall immediately inform the Registrar of the request,
together with the reasons therefor. The detainee shall immediately be
informed of the fact of any such request. A detainee may at any time
request the President to deny or reverse such a request for
prohibition of contact. 


Legal assistance

67. Each detainee shall be entitled to communicate fully and without
restraint with his defence counsel, with the assistance of an
interpreter where necessary. Unless such counsel and interpreter have
been provided by the Tribunal on the basis of the indigency of the
detainees all such communications shall be at the expense of the
detainee. All such correspondence and communications shall be
privileged. All visits shall be made by prior arrangement with the
Commanding Officer as to the ti.me and duration of the visit and shall
be subject to the same security controls as are imposed under Rule 63.
The Commanding Officer shall not refuse a request for such a visit
without reasonable grounds. Interviews with legal counsel and
interpreters shall be conducted in the sight but not within the
hearing, either direct or indirect, of the staff of the detention
unit. 


Spiritual welfare

68. Every detainee shall be entitled to indicate, on arrival at the
detention unit or thereafter, whether he wishes to establish contact
with any of the ministers or spiritual advisers of the host prison. 

69. A qualified representative of each religion or system of beliefs
held by any detainee shall be appointed and approved by the Bureau.
Such representative shall be permitted to hold regular services and
activities within the detention unit and to pay pastoral visits to any
detainee of his religion, subject to the same considerations of the
security and good order of the detention unit and of the host prison
as apply to other visits. 

70. Access to a representative of any religion shall not be refused to
any detainee, subject only to the same restrictions and conditions
provided for in Rule 63. A detainee may refuse to see any such
religious representative. 

71. So far as is practicable, every detainee shall be allowed to
satisfy the needs of his religious, spiritual and moral life by
attending services or meetings held in the detention unit and having
in his possession any necessary books or literature. By arrangement
with the General Director, a detainee may, on request, be permitted to
visit any religious facility within the grounds of the host prison.

72. The Commanding Officer, after consultation with the General
Director, and as far as is practicable, shall institute a work
programme to be performed by detainees either in the individual cell
units or in the communal areas of the detention unit. 

73. Detainees shall be offered the opportunity to enrol in such work
programme but shall not be required to work. A detainee who chooses to
work shall be paid for his work at rates to be established by the
Commanding Officer in consultation with the Registrar and may use part
of his earnings to purchase articles for his own use pursuant to Rule
82. The balance of any monies earned shall be held to his account in
accordance with Rule 14. 


Recreational activities

74. Detainees shall be allowed to procure at their own expense books,
newspapers, reading and writing materials and other means of
occupation as are compatible with the interests of the administration
of justice and the security and good order of the detention unit and
of the host prison. 

75. In particular, detainees shall be entitled to keep themselves
regularly informed of the news by reading newspapers, periodicals and
other publications and by radio and television broadcasts, all
necessary equipment to be provided at their own expense. The
Commanding Officer may refuse the installation of any such equipment
which he considers to be a potential risk to the safety and good order
of the detention unit or to any of the detainees. 

76. If, in the opinion of the Prosecutor, the interests of justice
would not be served by allowing a particular detainee unrestricted
access to the news, or that such unrestricted access could prejudice
the outcome of the proceedings against the detainee or of any other
investigation, the Prosecutor may request the Registrar, or in cases
of urgency, the Commanding Officer to restrict such access. If the
request is made to the Commanding Officer on grounds of urgency, the
Prosecutor shall immediately inform the Registrar of the request,
together with the reasons therefor. The detainee shall immediately be
informed of the fact of any such request. A detainee may at any time
request the President to deny or reverse such a request for
restriction of access. 

77. By arrangement with the General Director, detainees may use the
library and such vocational or other facilities of the host prison as
may be made available. 


Personal possessions of detainees

78. A detainee may keep in his possession all clothing and personal
items for his own use or consumption unless, in the opinion of the
Commanding Officer or the General Director, such items constitute a
threat to the security or good order of the detention unit or the host
prison, or to the health or safety of any person therein. All items so
removed shall be retained by the staff of the detention unit as
provided for in Rule 14. 

79. Any item received from outside, including any item introduced by
any visitor to a detainee, shall be subject to separate security
controls by both the detention unit and the host prison and may be
transported through the host prison to the detention unit by staff of
either the detention unit or of the host prison. The General Director
may refuse access to the host prison of any item intended for
consumption by detainees. 

80. As far as practicable, any item received for a detainee from
outside shall be treated as provided for in Rule 14 unless intended
and permitted under these Rules of Detention and the rules of the host
prison for use during imprisonment. 

81. The possession and use of any medication shall be subject to the
control and supervision of the medical officer. Detainees may possess
cigarettes and smoke them at such times and places as the Commanding
Officer permits. The possession or consumption of alcohol is not
permitted. 

82. Each detainee shall be authorized to spend his own money to
purchase items of a personal nature from the store operated by the
host prison. In the case of an indigent detainee, the Registrar may
authorize the purchase of such items, within reason, for the account
of the Tribunal. Detainees shall have the right to purchase such items
within seven days of arrival and at least once a week thereafter. 

83. On release of the detainee from the detention unit, or transfer to
another institution, all articles and money retained within the
detention unit shall be returned to the detainee except in so far as
he has been authorized to spend money or send such property out of the
detention unit, or it has been found necessary on hygienic grounds to
destroy any article of clothing. The detainee shall sign a receipt for
the articles and money returned to him. 


Complaints

84. Each detainee may make a complaint to the Commanding Officer or
his representative at any time. 

85. A detainee, if not satisfied with the response from the Commanding
Officer, has the right to make a written complaint, without
censorship, to the Registrar, who shall forward it to the President 

86. Each detainee may freely communicate with the competent inspecting
authority. During an inspection of the detention unit, the detainee
shall have the opportunity to talk to the inspector out of the sight
and hearing of the staff of the detention unit. 

87. The right of complaint shall include confidential access to the
relevant authority pursuant to Rule 85. 

88. Every complaint made to the Registrar shall be acknowledged within
twenty-four hours. Each complaint shall be dealt with promptly and
replied to without delay and, in any event, no later than two weeks of
receipt. 


REMOVAL AND TRANSPORT OF DETAINEES


89. When detainees are being removed to or from the detention unit,
they shall be exposed to public view as little as possible and all
proper safeguards shall be adopted to protect them from insult,
injury, curiosity and publicity in any form. 

90. Detainees shall at all times be transported in vehicles with
adequate ventilation and light and in such a way as will not subject
them to unnecessary physical hardship or indignity. 

91. The transport of detainees through the host prison shall be
conducted jointly by personnel of the detention unit and of the host
prison. 


AMENDMENT OF THE RULES OF DETENTION


92. Proposals for amendment of the Rules of Detention may be made by a
Judge, the Prosecutor or the Registrar and shall be adopted if agreed
to by not less than seven Judges at a plenary meeting of the Tribunal
convened with notice of the proposal addressed to all Judges. An
amendment to the Rules of Detention may be otherwise adopted, provided
it is unanimously approved by the Judges. Any such. amendment shall

SUMMARY OF CONTENT


INTRODUCTION

(PREAMBLE)

This directive has been drawn up in accordance with the 
provisions set out in the preamble and which govern the 
International Tribunal for Crimes in the former Yugoslavia. 

The text also has its origins in reference documents relating to 
legal assistance and, among them, the Rules of the European 
Commission and European Court of Human Rights and their 
addenda, and French and Dutch law relating to legal aid and 
their implementing texts. 

(ARTICLE 1) ENTRY INTO FORCE

This directive is intended to enter into force as early as 
possible, and in any event as soon as the Office of the 
Prosecutor commences his investigative inquiries. 

(ARTICLE 2) DEFINITIONS

The directive is an implementing text of the Statute and of the 
various rules adopted by the Tribunal in plenary session, 
which the Registrar must adopt in order to ensure 
implementation of the provisions concerning the right to 
counsel and the principle of assignment of counsel. It is 
therefore unnecessary to define in this directive, terms which 
are already defined in the basic texts. 

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

(ARTICLES 3 to 5)

These principles reiterate respectively the general right to a 
defence, the right to assignment of counsel and the principle of 
indigency as laid down in the instruments establishing the 
Tribunal and developed during the proceedings of the 
Tribunal's third plenary session relating to assignment of 
counsel. 

ASSIGNMENT PROCEDURE

(ARTICLES 6 to 13)

These provisions set out the detailed procedures for the 
assignment of counsel, including the application made by the 
suspect or the accused, the applicant's declaration of means 
and its certification, the particulars and analysis of his financial 
situation the decision by the Registrar, the intimation of this 
decision and the avenues of appeal available against a decision 
to reject a request. 

STATES OF ASSIGNED COUNSEL

(ARTICLES 14 to 22)

After noting the qualifying requirements for assigned counsel, 
the text defines the scope of their assignment, the legal 
implications of the assignment of counsel, and the bearing of 
costs and expenses and their recovery. 

Three further situations have been envisaged, namely the 
assignment of counsel away from the seat of the Tribunal, the 
withdrawal of assignment of counsel and the discontinuance of 
the services of counsel. 

REMUNERATION AND TRAVEL EXPENSES

(ARTICLES 23 to 31)

The remuneration paid to assigned counsel on completion of 
his engagement will comprise three categories, namely, a 
retainer, fees, and a daily  allowance whose rates and method 
of calculation are set out. 

The payment of such remuneration, and of all the other costs 
which fall to be paid rests upon the presentation of a detailed 
statement on a standard form provided by the Registry and 
submitted for payment on completion of the engagement of 
assigned counsel to the Financial Officer of the Registry. 

All payments in respect of the assignment of counsel must 
receive the prior approval of the Registrar, who will 
countersign any statement presented to the financial department 
for this purpose. 

THE ADVISORY PANEL

(ARTICLES 32 AND 33)

A consultative body is established, consisting of seven 
members to be appointed on the recommendation of 
representatives of the legal profession.  The Advisory Panel 
will be consulted as and when appropriate  by the Registrar or 
the President on questions relating to the assignment of 
counsel or on any other questions relating to the assignment of 
counsel of which the Tribunal is seized. The Advisory Panel 
may of its own initiative consult the Registrar on any matter 
relating to the assignment of counsel.  The members of the 
Advisory Panel will be appointed every two years on the 
anniversary date of the entry into force of the Directive. 

FACILITIES

(ARTICLE 34)

Subject to the availability of space and resources, some basic 
facilities would be provided for assigned counsel.

THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL
FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA

CASE NO:


THE PROSECUTOR
OF THE TRIBUNAL

AGAINST

MILAN MARTIC


INDICTMENT


      Richard J. Goldstone, Prosecutor of the International
Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, pursuant to his
authority under Article 18 of the Statute of the
International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia
(Tribunal Statute), charges:

  1. Since the summer of 1991, the Armed Forces of the
Republic of Croatia (HV) have been engaged in an armed
conflict with the Armed Forces of the self-proclaimed
Republic of Serbian Krajina (ARSK).

 2. From the commencement of the war in the summer of 1991
until the end of the year, the ARSK with the assistance of
the Yugoslav Peoples' Army (JNA) defeated the HV in numerous
battles taking control of approximately one-third of the
Republic of Croatia including parts of East and West
Slavonia, and the Krajina.

 3. After the cease tire in January of 1992, the United
Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was installed in the
areas held by the ARSK.

 4. One area held by the ARSK in Western Slavonia was the UN
Western Zone also known as Sector West, which remained under
the control of the ARSK until 1 May 1995.

 5. On 1 May 1995, the HV attacked the ARSK forces in Sector
West, and drove the ARSK forces south across the Sava River
into the Serbian-held part of Bosnia.

 6. In retaliation the military forces of the ARSK were
given orders by MILAN MARTIC, the president of the
self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), to attack
three Croatian cities, including Zagreb, the capital of the
Republic of Croatia.

 7. The Orkan rocket, a long range weapon, can be fitted
with different warheads to accomplish distinct tasks: either
to destroy military targets or to kill people. When the
Orkan is fitted with a "cluster bomb", such as used against
Zagreb, it is an anti-personnel weapon designed only to kill
people.

8. On 2 May 1995, at approximately 10.25 hours, upon the
orders of MILAN  MARTIC, Orkan rockets fitted with
"cluster-bomb" warheads were fired into the  central part of
Zagreb by the ARSK, causing death and injury to civilians in
Zagreb.  This was an unlawful attack against the civilian
population and individual citizens.

9. On 3 May 1995 at approximately 12.10 hours, upon the
orders of MILAN  MARTIC, the ARSK fired additional Orkan
rockets with "cluster-bomb" warheads  into the central part
of Zagreb, again causing death and injury to civilians in
Zagreb. This was also an unlawful attack against the
civilian population and individual citizens.


THE ACCUSED

10.  MILAN MARTIC was born on 18 November 1945 near Knin,
Croatia. He is a graduate of the Croatian police academy,
and was a senior inspector with the Croatian Ministry of
Internal Affairs.

11. In January of 1991, MILAN MARTIC was named head of
internal affairs for the self-proclaimed RSK. He was
re-appointed to that post in 1993, and in February of 1994,
he became president of the self-proclaimed RSK. He currently
resides in Knin, the capital of the self-proclaimed RSK.

 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

12. At all relevant times, a state of armed conflict existed
in the Republic of Croatia.

13. At all relevant times, the victims alleged in this
indictment were civilians who were protected by the laws and
customs of war.

14. At all relevant times, MILAN MARTIC was required to
abide by the laws and customs governing the conduct of war.

THE PROSECUTOR OF THE TRIBUNAL

AGAINST

RADOVAN KARADZIC

RATKO MLADIC


INDICTMENT

Richard J. Goldstone, Prosecutor of the International
Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, pursuant to his
authority under Article 18 of the Statute of the
International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia
("The Statute of the Tribunal"), charges:

THE ACCUSED

1. RADOVAN KARADZIC was born on 19 June 1945 in the
municipality of Savnik of the Republic of Montenegro. From
on or about 13 May 1992 to the present, he has been
president of the Bosnian Serb administration in Pale.

2. RATKO MLADIC was born on 12 March 1943 in the
municipality of Kalinovik of the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. He is a career military officer and holds the
rank of general in the Bosnian Serb armed forces. From on or
about 14 May 1992 to the present, he has been the commander
of the army of the Bosnian Serb administration.

SUPERIOR AUTHORITY

RADOVAN KARADZIC

3. RADOVAN KARADZIC was a founding member and president of
the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) of what was then the
Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The SDS was
the main political party among the Serbs in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. As president of the SDS, he was and is the most
powerful official in the party. His duties as president
include representing the party, co-ordinating the work of
party organs and ensuring the realisation of the
programmatic tasks and goals of the party. He continues to
hold this post.

4. RADOVAN KARADZIC became the first president of the

At the time he assumed this position, his de jure powers, as
described in the constitution of the Bosnian Serb
administration, included, but were not limited to,
commanding the army on the Bosnian Serb administration in
times of war and peace and having the authority to appoint,
promote and discharge officers of the army.

5. In addition to his powers described in the constitution,
RADOVAN KARADZIC'S powers as president of the Bosnian Serb
administration are augmented by Article 6 of the Bosnian
Serb Act on People's Defence which vested in him, among
other powers, the authority to supervise the Territorial
Defence both in peace and war and the authority to issue
orders for the utilisation of the police in case of war,
immediate threat and other emergencies. Article 39 of the
same Act empowered him, in cases of imminent threat of war
and other emergencies, to deploy Territorial Defence units
for the maintenance of law and order.

6. RADOVAN KARADZIC'S powers are further augmented by
Article 33 of the Bosnian Serb Act on Internal Affairs,
which authorised him to activate reserve police in emergency
situations.

7. RADOVAN KARADZIC has exercised the powers described above
and has acted and been dealt with internationally as the
president of the Bosnian Serb administration in Pale. In
that capacity, he has, inter alia, participated in
international negotiations and has personally made
agreements on such matters as cease-fires and humanitarian
relief that have been implemented.


RATKO MLADIC

8. RATKO MLADIC was, in 1991, appointed commander of the 9th
Corps of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) in Knin in the
Republic of Croatia. Subsequently, in May 1992, he assumed
command of the forces of the Second Military District of the
JNA which then effectively became the Bosnian Serb army. He
holds the rank of general and from about 14 May 1992 to the
present, has been the commander of the army of the Bosnian
Serb administration.

9. RATKO MLADIC has demonstrated his control in military
matters by negotiating, inter alia, cease-fire and prisoner
exchange agreements; agreements relating to the opening of
Sarajevo airport; agreements relating to access for
humanitarian aid convoys; and anti-sniping agreements, all
of which have been implemented.


GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

10. At all times relevant to this indictment, a state of
armed conflict and partial occupation existed in the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the territory of the
former Yugoslavia.

11. All acts or omissions herein set forth as grave breaches
of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 (hereafter "grave
breaches") recognised by Article 2 of the Statute of the
Tribunal occurred during that armed conflict and partial
occupation.

12. In each paragraph charging crimes against humanity,
crimes recognised by Article 5 of the Statute of the
Tribunal, the alleged acts or omissions were part of a
widespread, systematic or large-scale attack directed
against a civilian population.

13. The term "UN peacekeepers" used throughout this
indictment includes UN military observers of the United
Nations.

14. The UN peacekeepers and civilians referred to in this
indictment were, at all relevant times, persons protected by
the Geneva Conventions of 1949.

15. The accused in this indictment were required to abide by
the laws and customs governing the conduct of war, including
the Geneva Conventions of 1949.


CHARGES

16. The charges set forth in this indictment are in three
parts:

Part I of the indictment, Counts 1 to 9, charges a crime of
genocide, crimes against humanity and crimes that were
perpetrated against the civilian population and against
places of worship throughout the territory of the Republic
of Bosnia and Herzegovinia.

Part II of the indictment, Counts 10 to 12, charges crimes
relating to the sniping campaign against civilians in
Sarajevo.

Part III of the indictment, Counts 13 to 16, charges crimes
relating to the taking of UN peacekeepers as hostages.


PART I             

COUNTS 1-2
(GENOCIDE) 
(CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY)     

17. RADOVAN KARADZIC and RATKO MLADIC, from April 1992, in
the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, by
their acts and omissions, committed genocide.

18. Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat civilians were
persecuted on national, political and religious grounds
throughout the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Thousands
of them were interned in detention facilities where they
were subjected to widespread acts of physical and
psychological abuse and to inhumane conditions. Detention
facility personnel who ran and operated the Omarska,
Keraterm and Luka detention facilities, among others,
including, but not limited to Zeljko Meakic (Omarska), Dusko
Sikirica (Keraterm) and Goran Jelisic (Luka), intended to
destroy Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat people as national,
ethnic, or religious groups and killed, seriously injured
and deliberately inflicted upon them conditions intended to
bring about their physical destruction. The conditions in
the detention facilities, which are described in paragraphs
20-22 hereunder, are incorporated in full herein.

19. RADOVAN KARADZIC and RATKO MLADIC, between April 1992
and July 1995, in the territory of the Republic of Bosnia
and Herzegovina, by their acts and omissions, and in concert
with others, committed a crime against humanity by
persecuting Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat civilians on
national, political and religious grounds. As set forth
below, they are criminally responsible for the unlawful
confinement, murder, rape, sexual assault, torture, beating,
robbery and inhumane treatment of civilians; the targeting
of political leaders, intellectuals and professionals; the
unlawful deportation and transfer of civilians; the unlawful
shelling of civilians; the unlawful appropriation and
plunder of real and personal property; the destruction of
homes and businesses; and the destruction of places of
worship.


DETENTION FACILITIES  

20. As soon as military forces from Bosnia and elsewhere in
the former Yugoslavia began to attack towns and villages in
the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, thousands of Bosnian
Muslim and Bosnian Croat civilians were systematically
selected and rounded up on national, ethnic, political or
religious grounds and interned in detention facilities
throughout the territory occupied by the Bosnian Serb.s.
These facilities include, but are not limited to:

Detention Facility -- Dates of existence

Omarska  --  May- August 1992
Keraterm  --  May- August 1992
Trnopolje  --  May - December 1992
Luka  --  May - July 1992
Manjaca  --  Summer 1991 - December 1992
Susica  --  June 1992 - September 1992
KP Dom Foca  --  April - mid-1993


21. Many of these detention facilities were staffed and
operated by military and police personnel and their agents,
under the control of RADOVAN KARADZIC and RATKO MLADIC. In
addition, Bosnian Serb police and military interrogators had
unfettered access to all of the detention facilities and
operated in conjunction with the personnel in control of
these detention facilities. These facilities and personnel
include, but are not limited to:

Detention Facility -- Commander -- Guards

Omarska -- Zeljko Meakic (police) -- police/military
Keraterm -- Dusko Sikirica (police) -- police/military
Trnopolje -- Slobodon Kuruzovic (military) --
police/military
Luka -- Goran Jelisic (police) -- paramilitary
Manjaca -- Bozidar Popovic (military) -- military
Susica -- Dragan Nikolic (military) -- military
KP Dom Foca -- Milorad Krnojelac -- military

22. Thousands of Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat civilians,
including women, children and elderly persons, were detained
in these facilities for protracted periods of time. They
were not afforded judicial process and their internment was
not justified by military necessity. They were detained, in
large measure, because of their national, religious and
political identity. The conditions in the detention
facilities were inhumane and brutal. Bosnian Serb military
and police personnel in charge of these facilities,
including Dragan Nikolic (Susica), Zeljko Meakic' (Omarska),
Dusko Sikirica (Keraterm) and other persons over whom they
had control, subjected the civilian detainees to physical
and psychological abuse, intimidation and maltreatment.
Detention facility personnel, intending to destroy Bosnian
Muslim and Bosnian Croat people as national, ethnic or
religious groups, killed, seriously injured and deliberately
inflicted upon them conditions intended to bring about their
physical destruction. Detainees were repeatedly subjected to
and/or witnessed inhumane acts, including murder, rape,
sexual assault, torture, beatings, robbery as well as other
forms of mental and physical abuse. In many instances, women
and girls who were detained were raped at the camps or taken
from the detention centres and raped or otherwise sexually
abused at other locations. Daily food rations provided to
detainees were inadequate and often amounted to starvation
rations. Medical care for the detainees was insufficient or
non-existent and the general hygienic conditions were
grossly inadequate.


TARGETING OF POLITICAL LEADERS, INTELLECTUALS AND
PROFESSIONALS

23. Particularly singled out for persecution by the Bosnian
Serb military, Bosnian Serb police and their agents, under
the direction and control of RADOVAN KARADZIC and RATKO
MLADIC, were civilian political leaders and members of the
primary Bosnian Muslim political party, the Party for
Democratic Action (SDA), and the principal Bosnian Croat
political party, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), from
the cities of Prijedor, Vlasenica, Bosanski Samac and Foca,
amongst others. In many instances, lists identifying leaders
of the SDA and the HDZ were provided by the SDS to personnel
of the Bosnian Serb military, police and their agents. Using
these lists, Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat political
leaders were arrested, interned, physically abused and, in
many instances, murdered. Some local SDA leaders who were
persecuted because of their political beliefs include, but
are not limited to, Muhamed Cehajic (Prijedor), Sulejman
Tihic (Bosanski Samac), and Ahmet Hadzic (Brcko).

24. In addition to persecutions of Bosnian Muslim and
Bosnian Croat political leaders, the Bosnian Serb military,
police and their agents systematically targeted for
persecution on national or religious grounds, Bosnian Muslim
and Bosnian Croat intellectuals and professionals in many
towns and villages including Prijedor, Vlasenica, Bosanski
Samac and Foca, among others. Individuals who were
persecuted include, but are not limited to Abdulah Puskar
(academic), Ziko Crnalic (businessman) and Esad Mehmedalija
(attorney) from Prijedor; Osman Vatic (attorney) from Brcko.


DEPORTATION

25. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats from the
areas of Vlasenica, Prijedor, Bosanski Samac, Brcko and
Foca, among others, were systematically arrested and
interned in detention facilities established and maintained
by the Bosnian Serb military, police and their agents and
thereafter unlawfully deported or transferred to locations
inside and outside of the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. In addition, Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat
civilians, including women, children and elderly persons,
were taken directly from their homes and eventually used in
prisoner exchanges by Bosnian Serb military and police and
their agents under the control and direction of RADOVAN
KARADZIC and RATKO MLADIC. These deportations and others
were not conducted as evacuations for safety, military
necessity or for any other lawful purpose and have, in
conjunction with other actions directed against Bosnian
Muslim and Bosnian Croat civilians, resulted in a
significant reduction or elimination of Bosnian Muslims and
Bosnian Croats in certain occupied regions.


SHELLING OF CIVILIAN GATHERINGS  

26. Beginning in July 1992 and continuing through to July
1995, Bosnian Serb military forces, under the direction and
control of RADOVAN KARADZIC and RATKO MLADIC, unlawfully
fired on civilian gatherings that were of no military
significance in order to kill, terrorise and demoralise the
Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat civilian population. These
incidents include, but are not limited to the following:

Location/Type of Civilian Gathering - Municipality - Date -
Casualties

Sarajevo (picnic) - Sarajevo - 03/07/92 - 10
Sarajevo (airport) - Sarajevo - 11/02/93 - 4
Srebrenica (playground) - Srebrenica - 12/4/93 - 15
Dobrinja (soccer game) - Sarajevo - 01/06/93 - 146
Dobrinja (water line) - Sarajevo - 12/07/93 - 27
Sarajevo (residential street) - Sarajevo - 28/11/93 - 11
Ciglane Market (fruit market) - Sarajevo - 06/12/93 - 20
Alipasino Polje (children playing) - Sarajevo - 22/01/94 -
10   Cetinjska St (children playing) - Sarajevo - 26/10/94 -
7   Sarajevo (Livanjska Street) - Sarajevo - 08/11/94 - 7
Sarajevo (flea market) - Sarajevo - 22/12/94 - 9
Tuzla (plaza) - Tuzla - 24/05/95 - 195


APPROPRIATION AND PLUNDER OF PROPERTY  

27. Shortly after armed hostilities broke out in the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bosnian Serb forces
quickly suppressed armed resistance in most villages and
cities. During and after the course of consolidating their
gains, Bosnian Serb military and police personnel, and other
agents of the Bosnian Serb administration, under the
direction and control of RADOVAN KARADZIC and RATKO MLADIC,
systematically and wantonly appropriated and looted the real
and personal property of Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat
civilians. The appropriation of property was extensive and
not justified by military necessity. It occurred from April
1992 to January 1993 in the municipalities of Prijedor,
Vlasenica, and Bosanski Samac, among others.

28. The appropriation and looting of said property was
accomplished in the following manner and by the following
means, among others:

A. Thousands of Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat civilians
were forced into detention facilities where they remained
for protracted periods of time. Upon entering these
internment facilities, the personnel who ran the internment
facilities systematically stole the personal property of the
detainees, including jewelry, watches, money and other
valuables. The detainees were rarely provided receipts for
the property taken from them or given their property back
upon their release.

B. Civilians interned in these camps witnessed and/or were
subjected to physical and psychological abuse. After
witnessing or experiencing serious abuse, thousands of
internees were forcibly transferred from these camps to
locations inside and outside the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. Before being forcibly transferred, many
detainees were compelled to sign official Bosnian Serb
documents wherein they "voluntarily" relinquished to the
Bosnian Serb administration title to and possession of their
real and personal property.

C. In many instances, Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat
civilian detainees were taken from internment camps to their
homes and businesses and forced to turn over to their
escorts money and other valuables. In other instances, they
were used as labourers to load property from Bosnian Muslim
and Bosnian Croat homes and businesses onto trucks for
transportation to parts unknown. This occurred with the
consent and approval of those in control of the detention
facilities.

D. Many Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat civilians who were
not interned in camps were forced to stay in their
communities where they were subjected to physical and
psychological abuse from Bosnian Serb military and police
and their agents, paramilitary forces and lawless elements
of the Bosnian Serb community. Conditions for many became
intolerable and they left. Before leaving, many civilians
were compelled to sign official Bosnian Serb documents
wherein they "voluntarily" relinquished to the Bosnian Serb
administration their rights to their real and personal
property. In some cases, Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat
civilians who left their communities were permitted to take
with them limited amounts of personal property and money,
but even that property was stolen from them at Bosnian Serb
checkpoints or at other locations.

E. In many instances during and after the Bosnian Serb
military take-over of towns and villages, Bosnian Serb
military, police and their agents, entered the homes of
non-Serb civilians and plundered the personal property of

Bosnian Serb administration, have been on such a large scale
and implemented in such a systematic way that they have
destroyed, traumatised or dehumanised most aspects of
Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat life in those areas where
the Bosnian Serb administration has taken control.

32. RADOVAN KARADZIC and RATKO MLADIC knew or had reason to
know that subordinates in detention facilities were about to
kill or cause serious physical or mental harm to Bosnian

or had done so and failed to take necessary and reasonable

to do the same or had done so and failed to take necessary
and reasonable measures to prevent such acts or to punish
the perpetrators thereof.

and RATKO MLADIC. As de.scribed in paragraphs 18 and 20-22
of this indictment and incorporated in full herein, the

individually and in concert with others planned, instigated,
ordered or otherwise aided and abetted in the planning,
preparation or execution of unlawful attacks against the
civilian population and individual civilians with area fire
weapons such as mortars, rockets and artillery or knew or
had reason to know that the Bosnian Serb military forces
were about to unlawfully attack the civilian population and
individual civilians, or had already done so, and failed to

2. INTRODUCTION

2.1. The case of Dusan TADIC is important to the prosecution of
those persons responsible for committing the serious violations
of international humanitarian law which occurred in the
territory of the former Republic of Yugoslavia since January 1,
1991, and in the Prijedor region of Bosnia-Herzegovina in
particular.

2.2. The criminal acts allegedly committed by Dusan TADIC would
provide a clear illustration of a plan for the widespread and
systematic destructive persecution against the civilian
population of the Prijedor Region (commonly referred to as
"ethnic cleansing"). TADIC himself was a well known person in
the Prijedor community and his actions after the Serbian
takeover of the area stood out even amongst the other atrocities
that were being committed. In light of the fact that TADIC's
activities cross the spectrum of possible offenses within the
jurisdiction of the Tribunal, the issues in the TADIC case are
closely related to, and involve significant factual and legal
questions which have direct implications on, the overall
investigation and prosecution of those persons responsible for
committing the serious violations of international humanitarian
law which occurred in the territory of the former Republic of
Yugoslavia since January 1, 1991, and in the Prijedor region of
Bosnia-Herzegovina in particular.

2.3 To place the alleged actions of Dusan TADIC in proper
context, I will first explain the general background of the
takeover and ethnic cleansing of the Prijedor region and then
set forth TADIC's actions within that framework. The use of
the terms "Muslim" and "Croat" in the following paragraphs refer
to those citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina who were or are Muslim
or Croatian by heritage, and are used only for ease of
clarification. Depending upon the context in which it is used,
the term "Serb" may refer to either Bosnian citizens of Serbian
descent or when it is unknown whether the individuals were
Bosnian or citizens of Serbia proper.

3. EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE SEIZURE OF POWER AND ETHNIC
CLEANSING IN THE OPSTINA PRIJEDOR.

3.1. I am informed, and verily believe, that the Opstina
Prijedor is a regional "district" in northwest Bosnia. (See
attached map) It is situated between the Opstinas of Banja Luka
(to the east), Bosanska Dubica (to the north), Bosanski Novi (to
the west), and Sanski Most (to the south). Prijedor is also the
name of the largest city in Opstina. After the city of
Prijedor, Ljubija and Kozarac were the two next largest towns or
villages, with the rest of the area comprised of a small number
of villages. The Sana river flows through the region which is
dominated by heavily forested areas, including Kozarac Mountain
which lies to the north of Kozarac.

3.2. The city of Prijedor and the surrounding towns are located
within a corridor that can connect Serbian dominated areas in
the Krajina area west of Prijedor and Serbia proper to the east.
The Krajina is the traditional name for the area of land
extending along the border of and into Croatia and Bosnia
-Herzegovina. This area has been populated by the people of
Serbian descent for generations. The focus of the fighting in
Croatia was over the Serbian claim to the Krajina as an
independent Serbian republic with direct ties to Serbia proper.
The area of the Opstina Prijedor, therefore, had a special
military significance for the Serbians once the conflict in the
territory of the former Yugoslavia Republics of Croatia and
Bosnia-Herzegovina began. Although the opstinas in the wider
region, with the exception of Sanski Most, were Serb dominated,
within Prijedor the population was fairly evenly divided between
Muslims and Serbs with the Muslims having a small majority.
According to the 1991 census, Opstina Prijedor had a total
population of 112,470 people, of whom 44 per cent were Muslims,
42.5 per cent were Serbs, 5.6 per cent Croats, 5.7 per cent
'Yugoslavs' and 2.2 per cent others (Ukranians, Russians, and
Italians). According to the report of the United Nations
Commission of Experts established pursuant to the Security
Council Resolution 780 (1992), by June, 1993, over 43, 000 of
the nearly 50,000 Muslims in the area had left Bosnia or had
been killed.

3.3. In the early 1990's, nationalistic political parties
openly pursued political power for the first time in the area.
The two largest parties were the Muslim dominated Party of
Democratic Action (SDA - Stranka Demokratske Akcije) and the
Serb dominated Serbian Democratic Party (SDS - Srpska
Demokratiska Stranka). In the 1990 elections the Muslim SDA won
the majority of seats in the local Assembly. Despite this fact,
the Serbs still controlled by the majority of key positions in
the local political structure and government. The Muslim
population at first consented to this anomaly in order to
maintain relations. However, in late 1991 and early 1992, as a
response to the rising tensions and increasing Serb demands, the
Muslims began to try to assert their democratic claim to key
positions. The Serbs refused to yield some of the positions and
threatened force if the Muslims attempted to remove them from
office.

3.4 During 1991, some of the significant events that were
occurring outside the Prijedor area, but which foreshadowed the
future in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Prijedor included:

3.4.1. The declaration in January, 1991 by the Socialist
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (controlled by the Serbian
Republic), calling for the arming of local paramilitary groups
throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Krajina in response to an
arms build up by the Croatian national defense.

3.4.2. In the Spring, 1991, Serbian politicians in the Banja
Luka initiated the proclamation of the Bosanska Krajina
declaring a Serbian autonomous region: "Srpska Autonomna Oblast"
(SAO). A plebiscite was held in the Opstinas in the
northwestern Bosnia-Herzegovina to determine whether or not they
wanted to join the SAO. Only Prijedor and Sanski Most did not
vote to join the SAO,

3.4.3. In the summer of 1991, war broke out in Croatia and
fighting in Slavonia and other parts of Eastern Croatia. The
JNA issued a call up of all soldiers, active and reserve. The
Muslims and the Croats did not honour the call up. The Muslims
in Prijedor complained to the civil authorities in their area
and were told they did not have to honour the call up as the
Army had no authority to call up the reservists and militias.
Only the leadership of the Republics could issue such a
mobilization order. This lack of response by the Muslims and
Croats caused great resentment on the part of the Serbian
population. During the conflict with Croatia many of the JNA
forces were deployed through the Prijedor area. Throughout the
conflict there were a great number of soldiers in the Prijedor
area. At the same time, the Federal government, through the JNA,
began to arm the Serbian population in the area. Serbian
households received weapons that included machine guns,
automatic rifles, grenades, and ammunition.

3.4.4. In the autumn of 1991 the Serbians in Bosnia-Herzegovina
held a plebiscite directed at maintaining the region's ties with
the Serbian part of Yugoslavia. However, the Muslims and Croats
declared the plebiscite unconstitutional. Further, in the
autumn of 1991, the SAO was declared unconstitutional by the
Constitutional Court of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

3.5. As a result of the winding down of the conflict in
Croatia, Serbian attention focused more on Bosnia-Herzegovina.
In January 1992, "Assembly of the Serbian People of Bosnia
-Herzegovina" declared itself to be the duly elected
representative of the Serbian people and created the "Serbian
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina". The "Assembly" also declared
that the "Republic" would remain a unit of the Yugoslavian
Federal State. The Serbs maintained that the Muslims and the
Croats had acted unconstitutionally by declaring their
independence from Yugoslavia 1991 and seeking international
recognition of their independent state. In February, just
before the formal referendum on the sovereignty of Bosnia
-Herzegovina required by the European Community as a precondition
of recognition, the Serbs in the area changed the name of their
autonomous region to the Republic of Srpska. On February 29,
1992, the formal referendum was held on the issue of Bosnia
-Herzegovina's sovereignty as an independent state. 69% of the
electorate is reported to have voted, with 99% of those voting
for independence. The Bosnian Serb leadership directed that the
Serbian population was not to participate in the referendum. The
lack of Serbian participation was later used by the Bosnian Serb
leadership to question the constitutionality of the referendum.
The five Muslim members of the election committee from the
Prijedor area were all later detained in Omarska and Keraterm,
the two men were both killed, the three women all survived
detention at Omarska.

3.6. During this same time frame, the Serbs in the Prijedor
began to establish a local government administration that was
parallel to the existing authorities in Prijedor. This included
a pure Serbian police force at nine police stations, with secret
service functions. In addition to this shadow of government,
during the Spring of 1992 "Crisis Committees" was to direct the
activities of local Serb controlled agencies, including police
and military/paramilitary units.

3.7. During the Spring of 1992, tensions were increasing all
over Bosnia-Herzegovina, and in particular in the Prijedor
region. There were many causes for increasing severity of the
situation, but primarily among them were:

3.7.1. The takeover and control of the television transmitter
of the Kozara Mountain by a very small Serbian paramilitary
group. As a consequence, the population in the district could
not receive television programs from Sarajevo or Zagreb any
longer, only from Belgrade and Banja Luka. Those who watched
the broadcasts from Belgrade reported that the television
programs suggested that non-Serbs wanted war and were planning
the extermination of the Serbs.

3.7.2. The recognition of Bosnian independence of April 6,
1992, by the European Community and the United States and the
declaration the next day by the Serbs of the independent Serbian
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

3.7.3. The order one week later, by the Bosnian Serb government
for mobilization for war.

3.7.4. The erection of roadblocks on all main roads in Opstina
Prijedor.

3.7.5. The direction from the Serbian authorities that all non
-Serbs should turn in their weapons.

3.7.6. The ultimatum issued by Col. Vladimir Arsic, a JNA
brigade commander, that all soldiers returning from the war in
Croatia were to be redeployed around the Prijedor rather than
demobilized as demanded by local authorities. Within in two
weeks, United Nations Military Observers withdrew from Banja
Luka.

3.8. The final events that preceded the takeover by the
Serbians of the Prijedor area were:

3.8.1. The report by Radio Sarajevo on April 29, 1992 that a
forged facsimile was being circulated which purported to be
orders for the Bosnia-Herzegovina Territorial Defense (non-Serb)
to attack the JNA. The Bosnian government strongly decried the
facsimile as a hoax and stated there had been no orders issued.

3.8.2. The acceptance of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina,
with the consent of Belgrade, as a full member of the Conference
on Security and Cooperation in Europe.

3.9. During the day of April 30, 1993 Radio Prijedor broadcast
repeated announcements that non-Serbs should turn in their
weapons. Many non-Serbs were visited by Serbs, identified as
"officials," and "encouraged" to turn in their weapons.
Overnight, the Serbs seized power in Prijedor. The following
morning Serbian flags were flying on all official buildings and
Radio Prijedor broadcast announcements that the Serbs had taken
control of the area and it was then to be called Srpske Opstina
Prijedor. As an immediate consequence of the takeover, all non
-Serbs in official positions, such as police and government
administrators, were dismissed from their jobs. Within days of
the takeover, most non-Serbs were fired or laid off from their
jobs regardless of their stature.

3.10. Immediately after the takeover, communications between
Prijedor and the outside world were cut off. The telephone
system was no longer full operational, the media was completely
Serbian controlled, and travel was curtailed for non-Serbs. A
curfew was introduced to Prijedor city.

3.11. As these measures were implemented, a number of lists
were compiled by the Serbs. As stated above, even before the
takeover, Serbs had started to visit the non-Serbs who were
licensed to hold weapons and demand that they give up their
weapons. This process was intensified after the takeover, and
combined with a campaign where non-Serbian police and local
defense forces were instructed to hand over their weapons. The
names of all those that were believed to have possessed weapons
were placed on a list, regardless of whether they, in fact, had
any weapons or turned them in as instructed. The names of all
those who were fired or laid-off from their jobs in the area
were put on "waiting lists." These various lists were
reportedly later used at the detention camps to identify and
classify people. The non-Serb policemen were also informed that
they had to sign an oath of loyalty to the new Serbian
government, which most refused to do. Later they were among the
first groups to be persecuted and killed.

3.12. As a result of all of this, many of the Muslim villages
in the area erected their own roadblocks on the village
outskirts to protect the villages from the roaming bands of
gunmen. Until the incident at Hambarine, discussed below, were
there no major incidents reported at any of these roadblocks.

3.13. On 4 May 1992, Belgrade ordered the complete withdrawal
of "all JNA personnel within 15 days who were citizens of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia." As a result, several high
ranking officers "retired" and took positions in the Bosnian
Serb Army. Following the "withdrawal," the local remnants of
the JNA, with all their JNA armaments and equipment, were
converted into the Army of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia
-Herzegovina. The new army commander was General Ratko Mladic,
who at the time of the takeover was head of JNA Knin Corps. The
JNA Fifth Corps in Banja Luka became the Ist Krajina Corps under
the command of Maj. Gen. Momir Talic. The Ist Krajina Corps had
two divisions: the 30th and the 10th which included the 1st and
2nd Armored Brigades. These two brigades reportedly causes much
of the subsequent destruction in the area. The 43rd Motorized
Brigade was stationed in Prijedor and was actively involved in
the fighting in Hambarine, Kozarac, and Kurevo. Several
paramilitary groups are alleged to have operated in the area,
including Arkanovci, the Marticevci, the Seseljovci, and the
White Eagles.

4. MAJOR MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE PRIJEDOR AREA:

4.1. HAMBARINE - On 22 May 1992, a car with four Serbs and a
Croat was stopped at a Muslim checkpoint on the edge of
Hambarine. After words were exchanged, one of the Serbs opened
fire and in the ensuing gunfight, two of the men in the car were
killed. Shortly thereafter, Serbian authorities went on the
radio and demanded that Aziz Aliskovic (a former non-Serb
policeman) be turned in for shooting within 24 hours, despite
the fact that there was no evidence that he was involved in the
incident. Almost as soon as the deadline passed, the Serbs
launched a large artillery and tank assault on Hambarine which
lasted for two days followed by rampant pillaging. Much of the
village was destroyed in the shelling and most of the
inhabitants fled to other villages or to the nearby woods. On
23 May 1992, the Serbian authorities arrested Muhamed Ceharic, a
Muslim and the former mayor of Prijedor, and charged him with
arranging the attack on Hambarine. Ceharic was later killed.

4.3. PRIJEDOR CITY - On 23 May 1992, an ultimatum was issued to
the city of Prijedor. On 30 May, a small group (50 to 150) of
poorly armed local Muslims and Croats attempted to reenter the
city to take control of the central part of Prijedor. The Serbs
quickly put down this attempt with tanks and soldiers from the
Banja Luka corps as well as other units. Radio Prijedor
announced that the "attack" was committed by Green Berets
(Muslims) and Croatian HOS troops. The Serbs then used this
action as a pretext to destroy much of Muslim areas of the city.
A subsequent radio announcement claimed that certain areas of
town were in particular danger (Muslim dominated suburbs -
Stari Grad, Skela, Gomjenica, Puharska, Raskovac) and said all
the residents would be evacuated for their safety. Most of
those "evacuated" were taken to Trnopolje, Keraterm, or Omarska.
Later, a commission was formed to decide what to do with all the
damaged buildings. The majority of non-Serb homes and
businesses were destroyed on the basis that they had been too
badly damaged in the fighting. Serbs were compensated for their
property that was destroyed, non-Serbs were not.

4.4. VILLAGES ON THE LEFT BANK OF THE SANA - On 20 July 1992,
most of the non-Serb villages on the left bank of the Sana
suffered the same fate. Here, however, the fighting was done
primarily by infantry, regular army and paramilitary units, and
the shelling and artillery was not used as it had been in
Kozarac. Before the offensive there had been approximately
20,000 non-Serbs in these villages. (Ljubija, Biscani,
Rizvanovici, Tukovi, Sredice, Hegic, Kadarici, Durtovic,
Carakovo, Zekovi). During and subsequent to the attack, the
homes and businesses were plundered and those inhabitants not
killed were sent to camps.

5. THE CAMPS:

5.1. There were three main camps in the Prijedor area:
Omarska, a former mine complex; Keraterm, a former ceramics
factory; and Trnopolje, a complex of several buildings,
including a former school and the grassy fields that separated
and surrounded them. The primary purpose of both Omarska and
Keraterm was to incarcerate any male member of the non-Serb
population of the Prijedor area who was in any way perceived to
be a potential threat. This generally meant all non-Serb males
between the ages of 16 and 60.

5.2. Some non-Serb males who were well known or well connected
to Serbs were allowed to go to Trnopolje with their families and
then were normally sent to the Manjaca camp prior to their
release. The difference in Omarska and Keraterm seems to have
been that Omarska was where those who were considered to be
leaders or prominent citizens in the non-Serb community, or had
actively resisted the Serb takeover, were sent. Many of those
individuals did not survive. Keraterm was where the remaining
male population was held. Throughout the time the camps were
open there was regular communication, cooperation and the
transfer of prisoners among them as prisoners were interrogated
and their "status" determined.

5.3. The violations of international humanitarian law in
Omarska and Keraterm followed a pattern that was strikingly
similar. Prisoners were usually beaten as they disembarked from
the vehicles that transported them to the camp. There are also
reports of people being executed immediately upon arrival. The
prisoners in Moarska and Keraterm were generally denied food or
water for the first 48 to 96 hours and thereafter were given
very little water (usually contaminated) and starvation rations,
consisting of 1/8 of a kilo of bread and a cup of watery soup
per day. Most prisoners were robbed of their valuables and
identification papers either before they arrived at the camp or
immediately upon their arrival. Most were registered by the
camp officials upon their arrival (normally that is when they
were deprived of their possessions), although there were cases
where it was more than a week before some prisoners were
registered. In Omarska and Keraterm, the first interrogation of
a prisoner was normally conducted within the first 96 hours, but
again, there were cases where some prisoners were not
interrogated until they had been in camp for some weeks. It is
reported by the first prisoners in Omarska that there was a team
of Serbian military and police officials from Banja Luka who
stayed at the camp for the first month to train the Omarska camp
staff on how to conduct interrogations and operate the camp.

5.4. According to most prisoners the interrogations were
conducted by members of the Serbian army or police. Many of the
army personnel were reservists who were teachers or policemen.
In one case the interrogator was a film director. During the
interrogation in Omarska and Keraterm, the prisoners were
frequently beaten/tortured by soldiers who were present in the
interrogation room. It appears that some but not all of the
interrogators also participated in the beating/torturing of the
prisoners. The severity of the beating or torture seems to have
been related to the prisoners classification within the camp.
The wealthy, intellectual, and politically active seem to have
been the most severely tortured and many did not survive. The
next class of prisoner were those suspected of armed resistance
against the Serbs or planning the resistance. Within that
group, those people who were not executed or tortured to death
immediately upon capture or arrival at camp, were subjected to
very harsh beatings and torture. The final category of
prisoners were those who, according to the Serbs, "could not be
proven guilty." The severity of their treatment seemed to
depend on whether they stood out for any reason, any of the camp
personnel either had a grudge against the prisoner, or
alternatively, liked the prisoner.

5.5. The beatings/torture, both in the "formal interrogations"
and by the guards throughout the camps, generally involved the
use of blunt instruments (e.g., iron bars, truncheons, table
legs, police batons, rifle butts), with knives also frequently
used. The beatings/torture were intended to either cause death
or inflict permanent and debilitating injury, and not just
pain. Beatings with the blunt instruments were focused on the
joints of the legs, the kidneys, the spine, and the head. The
most common use for knives seem to be to sever tendons in the
knee and ankles or mutilate the major muscles of the legs. On
occasion the joints in the arms were also the target of knife
attacks. There are also many reports of murders committed by
slitting the throats of prisoners. Finally, there are widely
witnessed reports of mass executions in both Keraterm and
Omarska.

5.6. The concentration camp premises were sometimes so packed
with people that no more inmates could be crammed in. At least
on one occasion this allegedly resulted in an entire bus-load of
newly captured people being executed. Some 37 women were
detained in Omarska, while no women were detained in Keraterm
for more than a very short period of time while awaiting
transportation to another camp.

5.7. The women's groups were normally taken to the Trnopolje
camp. Here the regime was better than in Omarska and Keraterm,
nonetheless harassment and malnutrition was a problem for all
the inmates. The raping of women at Trnopolje, usually
involving gang rapes, was a regular occurrence for most of the
time the camp was open. Beatings and other kinds of torture and
even killings also occurred. Some of the detained women were
released after a few days as there was also a lack of space in
Trnopolje camp almost immediately after it opened.

6. TADIC:

6.1. When the actions of Dusan "Dule" TADIC, as described by
the eyewitnesses and set forth below, are considered within the
above-outlined context, they provide an explicit picture of the
final phases of the systematic attack against and destructive
persecution off the non-Serb civilian population in the Prijedor
region.

6.2. Prior to the takeover in Prijedor, Dusan "Dule" TADIC was
known as the owner of a cafe and a part time Karate instructor.
He was an officer in the reserve militia and had served as a
policeman in the Kozarac area. Although he had very good
relations with the Muslim population prior to 1992, at the start
of the tensions in the area he banned Muslims form his cafe.
(In respect of the foregoing [6.2], I relied on the documents
and statements cited in paragraphs 1.5.1; 1.5.2; 1.5.3; 1.5.4;
1.5.5; 1.5.7; 1.5.9; 1.5.10; 1.5.11; 1.5.13; 1.5.15; 1.5.16;
1.5.17; 1.5.18; 1.5.19; 1.5.20; 1.5.21; 1.5.22; 1.5.23; 1.5.24)

6.3. Witnesses have reported that prior to the Serbian
referendum in November, 1991, Dusan TADIC, along with his
father, Ostoja, was among those going to each Serb residence
counting the electorate and ensuring they intended to vote. It
is alleged that strong pressure was utilized to ensure all would
vote. TADIC was also involved in the creation of the death
lists of intellectuals and other prominent Muslims form the
Kozarac area. (In respect of the foregoing [6.3], I relied on
the documents and statements cited in paragraphs 1.5.1; 1.5.2;
1.5.3; 1.5.4; 1.5.5)

6.4. Eyewitness accounts identify TADIC as being
personally involved in the forced removal of Muslims from the
villages in the Prijedor area and the looting and destruction of
Muslim homes. TADIC was observed to be wearing a military
uniform on these occasions and was noticeably in charge of
whatever group was involved with him, whether it be during the
ethnic cleansing of villages or the torture and murder of
prisoners in the camps. During the forced removal and transfer
of non-Serbs from the villages in the Kozarac area, TADIC and
other individuals acting as Serbian soldiers in the attack were
witnessed to have summarily executed several unarmed non-Serbs
(among the victims were two brother) as those individuals were
complying with the Serbian demands to leave their villages and
move toward Prijedor city. (In respect of the foregoing [6.4],
I relied on the documents and statements cited in paragraphs
1.5.1; 1.5.2; 1.5.3; 1.5.4; 1.5.5; 1.5.7; 1.5.10; 1.5.11;
1.5.12; 1.5.18; 1.5.19; 1.5.21; 1.5.22)

6.5. Eyewitness accounts identify TADIC as being personally
involved in and directing the transfer of non-Serbs from the
villages to the camps. He is identified as conducting
interrogations and beatings of prisoners at both military
barracks in Prijedor and in the camps. He was seen on numerous
occasions in the Trnopolje camp and almost daily (or nightly) in
Omarska. (In respect of the foregoing [6.5], I relied on the
documents and statements cited in paragraphs 1.5.1; 1.5.2;
1.5.3; 1.5.4; 1.5.5; 1.5.6; 1.5.7; 1.5.8; 1.5.9; 1.5.10; 1.5.11;
1.5.12; 1.5.19; 1.5.20; 1.5.21)

6.6 At the Trnopolje camp TADIC was witnessed, on more than
one occasion, to have been involved in the raping of Muslim
women. On one occasion in the Summer of 1992, TADIC was
witnessed to have arrived at the Trnopolje area riding on a tank
with a group of Serbian soldiers. TADIC and the soldiers were
then involved in the rape of some Muslim women at a house
outside the camp. On another occasion in the Summer of 1992,
TADIC arrived at the camp in the company of a guard commander at
the Trnopolje camp carrying a list of names of prisoners, whom
TADIC transported to the Omarska camp. (In respect of the
foregoing [6.6], I relied on the documents and statements cited
in paragraphs 1.5.1; 1.5.2; 1.5.3; 1.5.4; 1.5.5; 1.5.6; 1.5.7;
1.5.8)

6.7. It was at the Omarska camp, however, that TADIC's actions
were most serious. Eyewitness accounts place him at the camp on
almost a daily (or nightly) basis during the period the camp was
open, from late May 1992 until mid-August 1992. At the camp he
was normally observed wearing a military uniform. On occasion
he would wear a black mask. However, due to his notoriety,
physical appearance, and his voice, he was well recognized even
on those occasions when he wore a mask. TADIC beat and
tortured prisoners on a daily basis and is personally responsible
for the murder of more than ten prisoners. The final number is
yet to be determined. The beatings/torture were accomplished
using a variety of weapons, including: truncheons, iron bars,
rifle butts, wire cables, and knifes. In addition, many of the
prisoners who survived the initial beating and torture by TADIC
were subsequently taken to the other buildings in the camp and
were never seen again. Among the most widely witnesses events
that TADIC was involved in was the murder of Emir Karabasic,
Jasmin Hrnjic, and Enver Alic. In June, 1992, those prisoners
were brutally beaten and tortured by TADIC and others, using
metal rods, truncheons, and knives, to the point of
unconsciousness. TADIC then forced a fourth prisoner to drink
motor oil from the garage and then bite off the testicles of the
unconscious prisoners. The three died as a result of their
torture. (In respect of the foregoing [6.7], I relied on the
documents and statements cited in paragraphs 1.5.1; 1.5.2;
1.5.3; 1.5.4; 1.5.5; 1.5.9; 1.5.10; 1.5.13; 1.5.14; 1.5.15;
1.5.16; 1.5.17; 1.5.18; 1.5.19; 1.5.21; 1.5.22; 1.5.23; 1.5.24)

6.8. TADIC did not hold a routine position at the camp, but was
brought in and allowed in for the specific purpose of torturing
and killing those non-Serbs perceived to be part of the
leadership or a prominent part of the Muslim or non-Serb
community. His daily presence in the camp involved the beating,
torture and murder of prisoners. He had the authority to direct
the actions of those men who accompanied him and of the known
camp guards. TADIC was also seen in the presence of the camp
commander, giving directions to camp staff on the arrival of new
prisoners. (In respect of the foregoing [6.7], I relied on the
documents and statements cited in paragraphs 1.5.1; 1.5.2;
1.5.3; 1.5.4; 1.5.5; 1.5.9; 1.5.10; 1.5.13; 1.5.14; 1.5.15;
1.5.16; 1.5.17; 1.5.18; 1.5.19; 1.5.21; 1.5.22; 1.5.23; 1.5.24)

THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL
FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA


THE PROSECUTOR
OF THE TRIBUNAL

AGAINST

GORAN JELISIC, a/k/a Adolf;

RANKO CESIC;


INDICTMENT


      Richard J. Goldstone, Prosecutor of the International
Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, pursuant to his
authority under Article 18 of the Statute of the
International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia
("Tribunal Statute"), charges:

 1.    Beginning on about 30 April 1992, Serb forces from
Bosnia and elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia fought to
obtain control of Brcko, a town and municipality in the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the former Yugoslavia.
Serb forces forcibly expelled Croat and Muslim residents
from their homes, and, with the assistance of local Serb
authorities, held them at collection centres, where many
were killed, beaten and otherwise mistreated. Many of the
women, children and elderly were confined at the nearby
village of Brezovo Polje. Most of the men of military age,
and a few women, were taken to Luka camp.

 2.    From about 7 May 1992 until early July 1992, Serb
forces confined hundreds of Muslim and Croat men, and a few
women, at Luka camp in inhumane conditions and under armed
guard. From about 7 May 1992 until about 21 May 1992,
detainees were systematically killed at Luka. Almost every
day during that time, the accused, often assisted by camp
guards, entered Luka's main hangar where most detainees were
kept, selected detainees for interrogation, beat them and
then often shot and killed them.

3. The accused, often assisted by camp guards, usually shot
detainees at close range in the head or back. Often, the
accused and camp guards forced the detainees who were to be
shot to put their heads on a metal grate that drained into
the Sava River, so that there would be minimal clean-up
after the shootings. The accused and guards then ordered
other detainees to move the bodies to one of two disposal
areas where the bodies were piled until they were later
loaded on trucks and taken to mass graves outside the town
of Brcko or disposed of in other ways.

4.    From about 21 May 1992 until early July 1992, the
detainees were subjected to beatings and, less frequently
than before, killings.

5. In early July 1992, the surviving Luka detainees were
transferred to another detention camp at Batkovic.

6. During the time Luka camp operated, the Serb authorities
killed hundreds of Muslim and Croat detainees.


The Accused

7.    On about 1 May 1992, Goran JELISIC, who was born on 7
June 1968 in Bijeljina, came to Brcko from Bijeljina, where
he had worked as an agricultural machinery mechanic. During
most of May 1992, Goran JELISIC acted as the commander of
Luka camp and called himself the "Serb Adolf".

8. Ranko CESIC, who was born in 1964 in Drvar, lived in
Brcko before the war. During May and June 1992, he acted
under the apparent authority of the Brcko police, and held a
position of authority at Luka camp.

alleged in this indictment took place between about 17 April

responsible for the crimes alleged against them in this

Statute. Individual criminal responsibility includes
committing, planning, initiating, ordering or aiding and
abetting in the planning, preparation or execution of any
crime referred to in Articles 2 to 5 of the Tribunal
Statute.

14. All acts and omissions charged as crimes against
humanity were part of a widespread, systematic or
large-scale attack directed against the Muslim and Croat
civilian population of Brcko.

15. In each count of this indictment charging torture, the
acts were committed by, or at the instigation of, or with
the consent or acquiescence of, an official or person acting
in an official capacity, and for one or more of the
following purposes: to obtain information or a confession
from the victim or a third person; to punish the victim for

Herzegovina. By May 1995. fewer than 300 of the Bosnian
Croat and Muslim residents remained.

2. On 17 April 1992, Serb military forces from Bosnia and
elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia seized control of the
town of Bosanski Samac.

3. Because of its location at the northwestern edge of
the "Posavina Corridor," control of Bosanski Samac was
important to Serb efforts to create a Serb-controlled land
bridge between Serbia and the Krajina Serbs in Croatia and
western Bosnia and Herzegovina.

4. After seizing control in the military takeover, Serb
authorities undertook a campaign of terror designed to force
most Bosnian Croat and Muslim residents to leave the area.

5. Beginning on 17 April 1992, Serb military and
political authorities coordinated and carried out the
following actions as part of that campaign of terror:

 a) arrested and detained most of the Bosnian Croat and
Muslim men in the municipality particularly the political,
economic, professional, academic, and civic leaders;

 b) established and operated, primarily under the
authority of the Serb police, detention camps where
prisoners were killed, beaten, tortured, sexually assaulted,
and otherwise mistreated;

 c) permitted units of paramilitary soldiers from Serbia
to enter the detention camps to kill and beat the prisoners;


 d) forced Bosnian Croat and Muslim residents to leave
their homes, and permitted Serb residents to move into the
vacated homes;

 e) expelled, through force or intimidation, Bosnian
Croat and Muslim residents of the municipality to other
countries and other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina;

 f) required Bosnian Croat and Muslim men, women, and
children to work on forced labor projects, such as digging
trenches and other work at military confrontation lines;

 g) robbed Bosnian Croat and Muslim residents of their
cars, cash and valuables, and looted their homes;

 h) looted and dismantled equipment and inventories
from Bosnian Croat and Muslim businesses;

 i) issued orders prohibiting Bosnian Croats and
Muslims from congregating in public and requiring Bosnian
Croats and Muslims to wear white arm bands to identify
themselves as non- Serbs;

 j) confiscated the bank accounts of many Bosnian
Croats and Muslims and blocked the funds in those accounts;

 k) mobilised Bosnian Croat and Muslim men into the
Bosnian Serb army and sent them to the front lines;

 l) created such an atmosphere of fear and oppression
among the non-Serb population that most Bosnian Croat and
Muslim residents fled the area.

INDICTMENT


Richard J. Goldstone, Prosecutor of the International
Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, pursuant to his
authority under Article 18 of the Statute of the
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia
("The Statute of the Tribunal"), charges:

1.  From about 25 May to about 30 August, 1992, Serb forces
collected and confined more than 3,000 Bosnian Muslims and
Bosnian Croats from the opstina of Prijedor,
Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the former Yugoslavia, in inhumane
conditions, under armed guard, in the Omarska "camp",
located in a former mining complex approximately fifteen
kilometres from the town of Prijedor. As set forth below,
the Serb forces killed, raped, sexually assaulted, beat and
otherwise mistreated the prisoners at Omarska.


Background - Omarska camp:

2.1. In May, 1992, intensive shelling of Muslim areas in the
opstina Prijedor caused the Muslim residents to flee their
homes. The majority of them then surrendered or were
captured by Serb forces. As the Serb forces rounded up the
Muslims and any Croat residents, they forced the Muslims and
Croats to march in columns bound for one or another of the
prison camps that the Serbs had established in the opstina.
The Serb forces pulled many of the Muslims and Croats from
the columns and shot or beat them on the spot.

2.2. On about 25 May 1992, about three weeks after Serbs
forcibly took control of government authority in the
opstina, and two days after the start of large scale
military attacks on Muslim population centres, the Serb
forces began taking prisoners to the Omarska camp.

2.3. During the next several weeks, the Serb forces
continued to round up Muslims and Croats from Kozarac,
Prijedor town, and other places in the opstina and interned
them in the camps. Many of Prijedor's Muslim and Croat
intellectuals, professional and political leaders were sent
to Omarska. There were approximately 40 women in the camp,
and all the other prisoners in the camp were men.

2.4. Within the area of the Omarska mining complex that was
used for the camp, the camp authorities generally confined
the prisoners in three different buildings: the
administration building, where interrogations took place and
most of the women were confined; the garage or hangar
building; the "white house," a small building where
particularly severe beatings were administered; and on a
cement courtyard area between the buildings known as the
"pista". There was another small building, known as the "red
house", where prisoners were sometimes taken but most often
did not emerge alive.

2.5. Living conditions at Omarska were brutal. Prisoners
were crowded together with little or no facilities for
personal hygiene. They were fed starvation rations once a
day and given only three minutes to get into the canteen
area, eat, and get out. The little water they received was
ordinarily foul. Prisoners had no changes of clothing and no
bedding. They received no medical care.

2.6. Severe beatings were commonplace. The camp guards, and
others who came to the camp and physically abused the
prisoners, used all manner of weapons during these beatings,
including wooden batons, metal rods and tools, lengths of
thick industrial cable that had metal balls affixed to the
end, rifle butts, and knives. Both female and male prisoners
were beaten, tortured, raped, sexually assaulted, and
humiliated. In addition to regular beatings and abuse, there
were incidents of multiple killings and special terror.
Many, whose identities are known and unknown, did not
survive the camp.

3. The persons accused in this indictment were commanders,
guards and others responsible for the conditions and
mistreatment of prisoners in Omarska camp or otherwise
assisted the accused.


The Accused:

4. Zeljko MEAKIC also known as (hereinafter a/k/a) Mejakic,
a/k/a Meagic, was in charge of Omarska camp beginning in
late June, 1992, and was in a position of superior authority
to everyone else in the camp. Before he took command of the
camp, he was chief of security and had full authority over
all the guards and any visitors. Before the war began in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, he was a police official in Omarska
village.

5. Miroslav KVOCKA and Dragoljub PRCAC were deputies to
Zeljko MEAKIC and were in positions of authority superior to
everyone in the camp other than MEAKIC. For most of the
first month of the camp's operation, KVOCKA was the
commander of the camp. Prior to the start of the war, both
KVOCKA and PRCAC were officials at the Ministry of the
Interior in Prijedor.

6. Mladen RADIC a/k/a Mlado RADIC a/k/a Krkan; Milojica KOS
a/k/a Krle; and Momcilo GRUBAN a/k/a Ckalja were shift
commanders who each supervised one of the three shifts of
guards that operated the camp. As shift commanders, when
they were on duty, they were in positions of superior
authority to all the camp personnel, second only to the camp
commander and his deputies.

7. The following accused were among those who acted as
guards in the Omarska camp:

   a. Zdravko GOVEDARICA
   b. first name unknown GRUBAN
   c. Predrag KOSTIC a/k/a KOLE
   d. Nedeljko PASPALJ
   e. Milan PAVLIC
   f. Milutin POPOVIC
   g. Drazenko PREDOJEVIC
   h. Zeljko SAVIC

8. In addition to the above-listed accused, who regularly
performed duties in Omarska camp, other Serbs entered the
camp, subject to the authority of Zeljko MEAKIC, Miroslav
KVOCKA, and Dragoljub PRCAC, where they killed, beat or
otherwise physically abused prisoners. Among those who
entered the camp were the following accused:

   a. Mirko BABIC
   b. Nikica JANJIC
   c. Dusan KNEZEVIC a/k/a Duca
   d. Dragomir SAPONJA

THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL
FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA


THE PROSECUTOR OF
THE TRIBUNAL

AGAINST

DUSAN TADIC a/k/a "DULE"
GORAN BOROVNICA


INDICTMENT


Richard J. Goldstone, Prosecutor of the International
Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, pursuant to his
authority under Article 18 of the Statute of the
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia
("The Statute of the Tribunal"), charges:

1. From about 25 May 1992 Serb forces attacked Bosnian
Muslim and Croat population centers in the opstina of
Prijedor, Bosnia-Herzegovina, forcing most Muslims and
Croats from their homes and confining many thousands,
including more than 3,000 who were held in the Omarska camp,
a former mining complex. The accused Dusan TADIC a/k/a
"Dule" a/k/a "Dusko", participated in the collection and
mistreatment, including killings, of Bosnian Muslims and
Croats in opstina Prijedor within Omarska camp and outside
Omarska camp, as set forth below. The accused Goran
BOROVNICA participated with Dusan TADIC in killings outside
of Omarska camp, as set forth below:


Background

2.1. In May, 1992, intensive shelling of Muslim areas in the
opstina Prijedor caused the Muslim residents to flee their
homes. The majority of them then surrendered or were
captured by Serb forces. As the Serb forces rounded up the
Muslims and any Croat residents, they forced the Muslims and
Croats to march in columns bound for one or another of the
prison camps that the Serbs had established in the opstina.
The Serb forces pulled many of the Muslims and Croats from
the columns and shot or beat them on the spot.

2.2. On about 25 May 1992, about three weeks after Serbs
forcibly took control of government authority in the
opstina, and two days after the start of large scale
military attacks on Muslim population centers, the Serb
forces began taking prisoners to the Omarska camp.

2.3. During the next several weeks, the Serb forces
continued to round up Muslims and Croats from Kozarac,
Prijedor town, and other places in the opstina and interned
them in the camps. Many of Prijedor's Muslim and Croat
intellectuals, professional and political leaders were sent
to Omarska. There were approximately 40 women in the camp,
and all the other prisoners in the camp were men.

2.4. Within the area of the Omarska mining complex that was
used for the camp, the camp authorities generally confined
the prisoners in three different buildings: the
administration building, where interrogations took place and
most of the women were confined; the garage or hangar
building; the "white house," a small building where
particularly severe beatings were administered; and on a
cement courtyard area between the buildings known as the
"pista". There was another small building, known as the "red
house", where prisoners were sometimes taken but most often
did not emerge alive.

2.5. Living conditions at Omarska were brutal. Prisoners
were crowded together with little or no facilities for
personal hygiene. They were fed starvation rations once a
day and given only three minutes to get into the canteen
area, eat, and get out. The little water they received was
ordinarily foul. Prisoners had no changes of clothing and no
bedding. They received no medical care.

2.6. Severe beatings were commonplace. The camp guards, and
others who came to the camp and physically abused the
prisoners, used all manner of weapons during these beatings,
including wooden batons, metal rods and tools, lengths of
thick industrial cable that had metal balls affixed to the
end, rifle butts, and knives. Both female and male prisoners
were beaten, tortured, raped, sexually assaulted, and
humiliated. Many, whose identities are known and unknown,
did not survive the camp. After the collection of thousands
of Bosnian Muslims and Croats in later May, 1992, groups of
Serbs including the accused later entered villages in which
Muslims and Croats remained, at which time they killed some
villagers and drove others from their homes.


General Allegations

3.1. At all times relevant to this indictment, a state of
armed conflict and partial occupation existed in the
territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

3.2. All acts or omissions set forth as grave breaches
recognised by Article 2 of the Statute of the Tribunal
occurred during that armed conflict and partial occupation.

3.3. All of the prisoners at the Omarska camp, and the
Bosnian Muslims and Croats of the opstina of Prijedor
referred to in this indictment were, at all relevant times,
persons protected by the Geneva Conventions of 1949.

3 4. All of the accused in this indictment were required to
abide by the mandate of the laws and customs governing the
conduct of war, including the Geneva Conventions of 1949.

3.5. Unless otherwise set forth below, all acts and
omissions set forth in this indictment took place between 24
May and 30 August 1992.

3.6. In each paragraph charging torture, the acts were
committed by, or at the instigation of, or with the consent
or acquiescence of, an official or person acting in an
official capacity, and for one or more of the following
purposes: to obtain information or a confession from the
victim or a third person; to punish the victim for an act
the victim or a third person committed or was suspected of
having committed; to intimidate or coerce the victim or a
third person; and/or for any reason based upon
discrimination of any kind

3.7. In each paragraph charging crimes against humanity, a
crime recognised by Article 5 of the Statute of the
Tribunal, the alleged acts or omissions were part of a
widespread or large-scale or systematic attack directed
against a civilian population, specifically the Muslim and
Croat population of the Prijedor district.

3.8. The term "Serb" refers either to Bosnian citizens of
Serbian descent or to individuals for whom it is unknown

out of their rooms by name, including Emir KARABASIC, Jasmin
HRNIC, Enver ALIC, Fikret HARAMBASIC and Emir BEGANOVIC. The
prisoners were in different rooms and came out separately.
The group of Serbs, including Dusan TADIC, severely beat the
prisoners with various objects and kicked them on their
heads and bodies. After Fikret HARAMBASIC was beaten, two
other prisoners, "G" and "H", were called out. A member of

buttocks and genitals and then to sexually mutilate Fikret
HARAMBASIC. "H" covered Fikret HARAMBASIC's mouth to silence
his screams and "G" bit off one of Fikret HARAMBASIC's

<PRE>
AN APPLICATION FOR DEFERRAL BY THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY IN THE
MATTER OF DUSKO TADIC ALSO KNOWN BY THE NAMES DUSAN 'DULE' TADIC

SUBMISSIONS BY THE PROSECUTOR

INTRODUCTION

In the aftermath of the horrors of the 2nd World War, and the trials
by the victorious powers of Nazi leaders at Nuremberg, it was
generally anticipated by the international community that a new era
had begun. An era in which the human rights of all citizens in all
countries of the world would be universally respected. It was not to
be. The past five decades have witnessed some of the gravest
violations of humanitarian law. Those responsible have too frequently
escaped trial and punishment by national courts. Indeed, in many cases
they have been in positions of leadership and power in their own
countries and effectively placed themselves above the law.

There was no mechanism devised by the international community for
establishing the guilt of perpetrators and punishing them. Justice was
denied to the millions of victims of murder, disappearances, rape and
torture. A catalogue of these gruesome violations of international
humanitarian law is to be found in the annual surveys produced by some
governmental and inter -governmental agencies and by national and
international non -governmental organizations.

This tribunal is the first attempt by the United Nations to enforce
international humanitarian law. It is the first recognition of the
reality that if international criminal law is to have relevance and
command respect, it must be capable of enforcement by the
international community. This remarkable step by the United Nations is
the consequence of events in the former Yugoslavia since 1991. In
describing these events in a provisional order on 13 September 1993
the International Court of Justice used the words of General Assembly
resolution 96 (I) of 11 December 1946 on "the Crime of Genocide" in
stating that those events shock:

"the conscience of mankind ... and is contrary to moral law and the
spirit and aims of the United Nations".

THE PRESENT APPLICATION

The proceedings today constitute the first public hearing by a trial
chamber of the Tribunal. The Application is brought pursuant to
Article 9 of the Statute which confers upon this Tribunal not only
concurrent jurisdiction with all national courts but primacy over them
in respect of both the investigation and prosecution of persons whose
alleged offences fall within its competence. In terms of Rule 9, the
Prosecutor is given the authority to apply to a trial chamber for the
issue of a formal request that a national court defer an investigation
and prosecution to the Tribunal.

In the present case we rely upon the provisions of Rule 9 (iii) which
provide that such an application may be made by the Prosecutor where
in the national investigations or in criminal proceedings instituted
in a national court

"what is in issue is closely related to, or otherwise involves,
significant factual or legal questions which may have implications for
investigations or prosecutions before the Tribunal"

THE PRIJEDOR INVESTIGATION

At the time I took up office on 15 August 1994 lawyers and
investigators in my office were already occupied with an investigation
into allegations of serious violations of humanitarian law in the
Prijedor region of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The allegations came from a
number of sources including the report of the United Nations
Commission of Experts established pursuant to Security Council
resolution 780 (1992).

The Deputy Prosecutor, Mr. Blewitt, became aware of the arrest in
Germany of Tadic. The German authorities were subsequently requested
to provide the Prosecutor with all relevant information concerning the
investigation into crimes allegedly committed by Tadic in Prijedor.
The German authorities complied with that request and provided my
Office with relevant information. In addition, statements have been
obtained by my Office from additional witnesses who are presently in
The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. My Office is
furthermore in possession of documents relevant to the events in
Prijedor and, in particular, the allegations against Tadic.

I am presently considering the issue of one or more indictments
against individuals who were involved in the serious violations of
humanitarian law in Prijedor.

As appears from the declaration of Michael Keegan, attached to my
application, a policy was executed in Prijedor which involved the
widespread and systematic persecution of the non-Serb and particularly
the Muslim community - a policy which has commonly come to be
described as "ethnic cleansing". According to the report of the
Commission of Experts over 43,000 of the approximately 50,000 Muslims
who lived in Prijedor in 1991 had left Prijedor or had been killed by
June 1993.

Witnesses available to me are able to describe the events which led on
30 April 1992 to the overnight seizure of power in Prijedor by Serbs
and the announcements broadcast on local radio to the effect that the
area was thenceforth to be called Srpske Opstina Prijedor. Serbian
flags were flying on all official buildings and all non-Serbian
officials, including policemen, were dismissed.

Three major concentration camps (logori) were set up in the Prijedor
area - in Omarska, a former mine complex, Keraterm, a former ceramics
factory, and Tmopolje, a complex of several buildings. At Omarska and
Keraterm mostly male members of the non-Serb population of Prijedor
were incarcerated - most of them -between the ages of 16 and 60. Many
leaders and prominent citizens in the non-Serb population were taken
to Omarska. Women were generally taken to Tmopolje.

The serious atrocities which allegedly were carried out at the three
camps are described in the declaration of Michael Keegan. They are
such that, in my opinion, if they are proved, the persons who ordered
the atrocities and those who executed them are guilty of serious
violations of humanitarian law and have committed offences which fall
within the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. I regard it as my duty as
Prosecutor to issue indictments against such people if their
involvement in these events can be proved by sufficient evidence. The
investigations in this regard are still ongoing.

THE CASE AGAINST TADIC

As appears from the declaration of Michael Keegan my Office is in
possession of witnesses statements which directly implicate Tadic in
some of the atrocities committed in Prijedor. The allegations against
him are as follows. He was involved directly in the events which led
to the removal of the majority of the Muslim population of Prijedor
and effectively the destruction of that community. The first of them,
according to witnesses was the organization of the Serbian referendum
in November 1991. He helped create what were, in effect, death lists
of Muslim intellectuals and other prominent citizens of Prijedor. He
was involved in the forced removals of Muslims from the villages of
the Prijedor region and the looting and destruction of Muslim houses.
I would emphasize that according to eye witnesses, when he
participated in those events, Tadic wore a military uniform and was in
command of a group involved in the actions.

Again, eye witnesses are able to testify to Tadic and the group under
his command summarily executing unarmed non-Serbs. He was directly
involved in directing the transfer of non-Serbs from the villages in
the Prijedor region to the camps. He was involved in assaults of
prisoners at the camps and at the military barracks in Prijedor. He
was seen on numerous occasions in the Tmepolje camp and at Omarska
camp. There is an allegation that Tadic was involved in incidents of
rape at Omarska and that is being investigated.

The gruesome nature of the events which witnesses can describe is
illustrated in the following extract from Michael Keegan's
declaration:

"Among the most widely witnessed events that Tadic was involved in was
the murder of Emir Karabasic, Jasmin Hrnjic, and Enner Alic.... Three
prisoners were brutally beaten and tortured by Tadic and others, using
metal rods, truncheons, and knives, to the point of unconsciousness.
Tadic then forced a fourth prisoner to drink motor oil from the garage
and then bite off the testicles of the unconscious prisoners. The
prisoners died as a result of their torture.

I would also emphasize that Tadic was not a regular official at any of
the camps. It appears that he was in a position of some leadership in
the area and was involved in directing the activities of those with
him on his visits to the camps as well as regular officials.

I submit that the evidence of eye witnesses, if accepted by a trial
chamber of this Tribunal, will make Tadic guilty of some of the most
serious offences falling within the competence and jurisdiction of
this Tribunal.

INDICTMENTS

I anticipate that within a short time indictments will be submitted by
me to the Registrar against Tadic and other persons who have been
identified as having been involved in the "ethnic cleansing" policy in
the Prijedor Opstina. In support of such indictments I will rely on
the evidence of the witnesses located by the German investigators in
Germany and other witnesses who have been located and interviewed in
Germany and elsewhere by our investigators.

The indictments will include serious offences in respect of which the
German authorities have no evidence and the other accused will be
persons who are outside Germany.

It is not possible during this application, which is in public, to
disclose details of the investigations being undertaken by my Office,
nor is it possible to disclose the identity of other persons under
investigation and who are likely to be included in these indictments.

I can say, however, that the involvement of Tadic in the factual
circumstances under investigation by my Office is very significant and
it will adversely affect the investigation and prosecution of other
individuals if Tadic is prosecuted in Germany.

DEFERRAL

We submit that having regard to the scale and nature of the atrocities
alleged to have taken place in Prijedor and the relevance of those
events in respect of "ethnic cleansing" in Bosnia-Herzegovina, this
Tribunal is the proper forum and the only proper forum for trying
those accused of playing leading roles in respect thereof. It would
certainly not be convenient or in the interests of justice if Tadic
were to be tried in Germany only to be indicted and retried before
this Tribunal.

The legal issues which will arise in a trial of Tadic are central to
the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. They will involve issues of
international law which are applicable to the crimes alleged and the
nature and manner of their proof. So both substantive and procedural
legal issues which would arise in a trial against Tadic will arise in
a case against those who acted in concert with him or acted in
pursuance of a common policy.

The factual issues speak for themselves. The events in Prijedor during
1992 form an important area of investigation by my Office.

It follows very clearly in our submission that the Tadic investigation
by Germany concerns an issue closely related to and involves
significant factual and legal questions which will have implications
for investigations currently undertaken by me.

The Tadic case therefore falls within the provisions of Rule 9 (iii)
and, in terms of Article 9 (2) of the Statute and Rule 10(A), this
Chamber may issue a formal request to Germany that its national courts
defer to the competence of the Tribunal.

FORM OF ORDER

Until an indictment has been issued against Tadic, a warrant for his
arrest cannot be issued under Article 19 of the Statute. However, to
the extent that it may be or become necessary I am authorized by Rule
40 (i), in a case of urgency, to request any State to arrest a suspect
provisionally. I will therefore request Germany to effect the
provisional arrest of Tadic if that is considered necessary by me for
any reason prior to the issue of an indictment.

We would therefore request an order in the following terms or in terms
considered appropriate by this Trial Chamber:

Germany and any of its courts currently seized with the Tadic
investigation defer to the competence of this Tribunal as and from the
date of this Order.

<H2>The Indictments</H2>

<P>In early October 1945, the four prosecuting nations -- the United States, Great Britain, France and Russia -- issued an indictment against 24 men and six organizations. The individual defendants were charged not only with the systematic murder of millions of people, but also with planning and carrying out the war in Europe.</P>

<P>Twenty-one of the indicted men eventually sat in the dock in the Nuremberg courtroom. One of those named, labor leader Robert Ley hanged himself before the trial began. Another, the industrialist Gustav Krupp, was judged too frail to stand trial. Martin Bormann, who as Adolf Hitler's private secretary was one of the most powerful Nazi leaders, was nowhere to be found. He was tried in absentia and sentenced to hang if he should ever turn up. Bormann apparently died as the Soviets entered Berlin -- his remains were identified there in 1972 and he was declared dead by a German court the following year.</P>

<P>Lt. Col. Murray Bernays, an attorney in the U.S. War Department who collected evidence on crimes committed against GIs, had devised a scheme to try the Nazis as conspirators in waging aggressive war and to try Nazi organizations as a means of reaching hundreds of thousands of members. His ideas were promoted by Secretary of War Henry Stimson and eventually incorporated into the indictment.</P>

<P><B>The Indictment of Nazi Organizations</B><BR>
The indictment of Nazi organizations was designed to deal with the problem of what to do about the hundreds of thousands of people who had been members of organizations such as the SS and the Gestapo. The idea was to find them to have been criminal organizations, then hold hearings to determine the extent to which a member was guilty.</P>

<P>At the conclusion of the trial against the 21 individuals, the International Military Tribunal spent a month hearing testimony about the organizations.</P>

<P>The indictment of the organizations, however, raised a fundamental legal question: the legitimacy of creating a system of guilt by association. Although members of the criminal organizations were later tried by German denazification courts set up by the U.S. occupation government, no one was ever punished solely on the basis of the tribunal convictions.</P>

<P>Three of the six indicted organizations were found guilty. They were: the SS, the Gestapo and the Corps of the Political Leaders of the Nazi Party.</P>

<P>Three of the organizations were not convicted. They were: the SA (Hitler's street thugs, known as brownshirts, whose power had dwindled in the 1930s); the Reichsregierung (Reich Cabinet) and General Staff and High Command of the German Armed Forces. The latter two organizations were determined to cover relatively few members so that it was deemed better to deal with them as individuals.</P>

<P><B>The Charges</B><BR>
The four powers divided the prosecution work, giving the United States the complicated and most difficult job of proving Count One -- the conspiracy charge.</P>

<P><B>Count One: Conspiracy to Wage Aggressive War</B><BR>
The "common plan or conspiracy" charge was designed to get around the  problem of how to deal with crimes committed before the war. The defendants charged under Count One were accused of agreeing to commit crimes.</P>

<P>The concept of conspiracy was not a part of continental law, and remained controversial throughout the trial.</P>

<P>Some historians have argued that this count caused prosecutors to over-emphasize the coherence of Nazi policymaking. It also gave the defense an additional reason to emphasize the confused Nazi command structure and allowed the defendants to buttress their contentions of ignorance of the regime's brutality.</P>

<P><B>Count Two: Waging Aggressive War, or "Crimes Against Peace"</B><BR>
This evidence was presented by the British prosecutors and was defined in the indictment as "the planning, preparation, initiation, and waging of wars of aggression, which were also wars in violation of international treaties, agreements, and assurances."</P>

<P>This charge created problems for the prosecutors. Although Hitler had clearly waged an aggressive war, beginning with the invasion of Poland in 1939, Count Two was based on allegations that the Germans had violated international agreements such as the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928. Signatories to that agreement had renounced war as an instrument of national policy (as opposed, say, to defensive war), but the pact did not define "aggressive war" and did not spell out the penalties for its violation.</P>

<P>(The Anschluss and the invasion of Czechoslovakia were not held to be aggressive wars because Hitler had manipulated the political situation in each nation in order to avoid an invasion.)</P>

<P>The Soviet Union also had broken the Kellogg-Briand Pact by invading Finland, Poland and the Baltics, and had schemed with Hitler to sign the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact in 1939 (which secretly divided Poland). </P>

<P>Robert Jackson, the chief U.S. prosecutor, wanted the International Military Tribunal to create new international law that would outlaw aggressive war. Clearly, the premise that it is possible to outlaw war is a questionable one.</P>

<P><B>Count Three: War Crimes</B><BR>
The Russian and French prosecutors presented evidence on atrocities committed in the East and West, respectively.</P>

<P>Count Three was intended to deal with acts that violated traditional concepts of the law of war -- e.g. the use of slave labor; bombing civilian populations; the Reprisal Order (signed by Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, a defendant, this order required that 50 Soviet soldiers be shot for every German killed by partisans); the Commando Order (issued by Keitel, it ordered that downed Allied airmen be shot rather than taken captive).</P>

<P>The violations of international law under Count Three were more clearly rooted in precedent than the other counts.</P>

<P>International laws of war had developed during the 18th and 19th centuries. The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 dealt with the conduct of war by outlawing certain types of weapons (dum-dum bullets, poison gas) and outlining treatment of POWs and civilians. The Geneva Conventions of 1864 and 1906 dealt with treatment of the sick and wounded. (After 1929, the treatment of POWs was promulgated by the Geneva Convention.) Naval law developed separately and originally dealt with problems of piracy, rescue, false flags and the like. </P>

<P>War crimes were defined under the London Charter (the document drafted by the Allies before the trial began) as "murder, ill treatment or deportation to slave labor or for any other purpose of civilian population or in occupied territory, murder or ill-treatment of prisoners-of-war or persons on the seas, killing of hostages, plunder of public or private property, wanton destruction of cities, towns, or villages or devastation not justified by military necessity."</P>

<P><B>Count Four: Crimes Against Humanity</B><BR>
The Russians and the French again divided responsibility along East-West lines.</P>

<P>Count Four was applied to defendants responsible for the death camps, concentration camps and killing rampages in the East.</P>

<P>Initially, crimes against humanity were understood to be crimes committed by a government against its own people, and there was some question as to whether the concept could be applied internationally. Their inclusion in the London Charter was a novel extension of the concept.</P>

<P>The London Charter defined these crimes as "murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population before or during the war, or persecutions on political, racial, or religious grounds in execution of or in connection with any crimes within the jurisdiction of the International Military Tribunal, whether or not in violation of domestic law of the country where perpetrated."</P>

<P><B>Selection of Defendants</B><BR>
The list of the accused was to some extent arbitrary. The defendants represented the major administrative branches of the Third Reich and included prisoners held by each of the four prosecuting nations. Apparently, little attention was paid to the availability of evidence against them. Attention was generally paid to how well known they were and how much power they had wielded. However, Hans Fritzsche, who was held by the Russians, had been a relatively minor official in Josef Goebbels' propaganda ministry but was included, along with Admiral Erich Raeder, to appease the Russians.</P>

<H2>The Creation of the Tribunal and the Law Behind It</H2>

<P><B>Creation of the International Military Tribunal</B><BR>
During World War II, the Allies and representatives of the exiled governments of occupied Europe met several times to discuss post-war treatment of the Nazi leaders. Initially, most of the Allies considered their crimes to have been beyond the scope of human justice -- that their fate was a political, rather than a legal, question. </P>

<P>Winston Churchill, for example, said in 1944 that they should be "hunted down and shot." The French and Soviets also supported summary executions. The Americans, however, pushed for a trial. (A faction within the U.S. government led by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson had won a domestic battle over the U.S. position on punishment of the Nazis. The other faction, led by Henry Morgenthau, the Jewish secretary of the Treasury, supported a harsh plan designed to prevent Germany from ever rising again as an industrial power.)</P>

<P>In August 1945, the British, French, Americans and Soviets, meeting in London, signed the agreement that created the Nuremberg court, officially the International Military Tribunal, and set ground rules for the trial. The London Charter of the International Military Tribunal, was named to avoid using words such as "law" or "code" in an effort to circumvent the delicate question of whether the trial would be ex post facto.</P>

<P>The London Charter set down the rules of trial procedure and defined the crimes to be tried. (It did not define the term "criminal organizations," although six organizations were indicted under the charter.)</P>

<P>The defendants were charged not only for the systematic butchering of millions of people, but also for planning and carrying out the war in Europe. </P>

<P><B>The Law</B><BR>
The International Military Tribunal combined elements of Anglo-American and civil (continental) law. Defendants' rights and the rules of evidence differed in several ways from those in American courtrooms:

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>In contrast to the U.S. system, in which the prosecutors must show evidence suggesting there is probable cause to try a defendant, civil law requires that all proof be presented with the indictment. At the International Military Tribunal, some of the proof was presented at the time of indictment, some was not.<P>

<LI>In contrast to U.S. practice, defendants were permitted to give unsworn statements at the end of the trial.<P>

<LI>Hearsay evidence was allowed. This often came in the form of statements by individuals not called as witnesses. The statements were read by prosecutors; defendants, on cross examination, were asked to respond to incriminating allegations. In U.S. courts, unlike at Nuremberg, the accused have the right to confront and question his accuser. At Nuremberg, evidence merely had to be "probative" to be admitted.<P>

<LI>The London Charter did not create a right to a jury trial.<P>

<LI>There was no right to appeal and no court to which the defendants could appeal. The defendants could ask the Control Council of Germany -- the Allied occupation government, to reduce or change their sentences, and those who were found guilty did seek clemency from the Control Council. Their request was rejected and ten of the eleven defendants who received death sentences were hanged two weeks later. (The eleventh, Hermann Goering, committed suicide several hours before he was to be hanged.)<P>

<LI>The defendants had a right to an attorney of their choice, although they could represent themselves if they wanted (none chose to do so). The four prosecuting nations paid the attorneys' fees.<P>

<LI>The defendants also had a right to present evidence in their own defense and to cross-examine any witnesses against them.<P>

<LI>The law of the London Charter was arguably ex post facto.

<H2>Interview with Nuremberg Trial Prosecutor Drexel Sprecher</H2>

<P>QUESTION: What were your expectations of the Nuremberg Tribunal?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: My expectations of the Nuremberg Tribunal was not only that it would punish some of the worst criminals of all time, but also that it would expose in a way that people could understand how a dictatorship came to power, and how it slowly built itself to be the oppressive regime it was.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Did it accomplish those-- were your expectations fulfilled? Did it accomplish that?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: I think for the most part they were. For some time after the trial, I was a little surprised that the public attention had been diverted by one thing and another. Particularly by the Cold War. But oh, for the last 20 or 30 years, I think there's been a renewed interest. And particularly during the last year.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Why did Justice Jackson concentrate on the notion of aggressive war?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Well, I think that Justice Jackson concentrated on aggressive war because it encompassed the whole. The atrocities, the war crimes, would not have been possible if there hadn't been aggressive war.</P>

<P>So I think he wanted to point out and to emphasize that the worst crime of all is the initial one, which is aggressive war. And that following it come the atrocities and the war crimes.</P>

<P>QUESTION: I see. Now, you were involved, in, I think, assembling and transporting to Nuremberg the Rosenberg documents.</P>

<P>SPRECHER: That's correct.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Tell me about that.</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Rosenberg documents were found, actually, because of a tip from a German. A German had watched Rosenberg bury them. And he told the Americans about this, and we sent a Major Coogan to retrieve them and bring them to, to Paris.</P>

<P>And shortly after they'd gotten to Paris, Colonel Storey, the First Executive Trial Counsel, shows them to me. Colonel Storey asked me to see if I could find something special in there. And if you want, I can tell you about that.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Please do.</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Colonel Storey said the Rosenberg documents were showing tremendous numbers of war crimes and atrocities and stealing of art. But so far they hadn't showed us anything about aggressive war.</P>

<P>So he asked me if I would sit down and do something, because he was flying to London the next day to see Jackson, and he wanted to take some documents along that bore on aggressive war. So I went into this huge room where we had these files lined up.</P>

<P>And I could only see one narrow document, one narrow book. And it was called, "A.P.A. Norway" -- "Ah Pay Ah Norvegan". So I thought, well, that, that's interesting.</P>

<P>Let me go in just before the Germans interview-- invaded Norway and see what there is. And sure enough, Quisling and his deputy, Haagelin, had flown into, to Germany just before the invasion of Norway and had seen Rosenberg as well as Hitler.</P>

<P>And so this connected them up to the aggressive war charge, relatively well. And that was one of the first things that came out of the Rosenberg documents on aggressive war. Now, later on, there was much more, because before the invasion of the Soviet Union, Rosenberg was put in charge of developing a big paper on how they were going to exploit the ser-- Soviet Union.</P>

<P>And he worked on that for at least several months before the actual invasion, which is another case where the Rosenberg documents were very helpful.</P>

<P>QUESTION: I see. Now, what were Justice Jackson's expectations of Nuremberg? How did he see it?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Well, I expect that he saw it as a great means of exposing the Nazi regime as well as a means of getting the punishment of the main leaders.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Now, did his attitude about the tribunal change at all during the trial, during the course of the trial?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: About the tribunal in the sense of the judges or the whole proceeding?</P>

<P>QUESTION: Both. First talk about the judges. How, what were Jackson's impressions of the judges?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Well, I know very little about what his impressions of the, the judges were, because he never talked to me about it. So I can't really give you much help there.</P>

<P>As far as the tribunal is concerned, he began to get worried after the defense case began that the tribunal was allowing the defense too much leeway. And that they weren't paying attention to relevancy or, or, or accumulation.</P>

<P>So at one point, he gets into quite a struggle with the tribunal, which was most unfortunate. And he lost his temper. And that was most unfortunate, too. Because he was not given to that normally speaking. And I don't think he ever lost it again.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Now, were you present in the courtroom for Jackson's opening statement?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: I was present in the balcony of the courtroom for Jackson's opening statement, but not down at the prosecution table. Because I had not won my spot at the prosecution table at that point.</P>

<P>QUESTION: What was the atmosphere like in the courtroom the day of Jackson's opening statement?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Well, the courtroom was very crowded. And there was a certain degree of expectation that you could kind of feel floating around. Of course, the -- his opening statement did not come until after the reading of the indictment.</P>

<P>And so, the original tension had kind of quieted down. And the interpreters and all had gotten accustomed to, to dealing with the actual trial, even before Jackson started speaking.</P>

<P>QUESTION: And what was the reaction of the defendants to Jackson's opening statement?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Well, there I can only speak again from watching them in the dock, and that was from a distance.</P>

<P>QUESTION: But how did, how did they seem in the dock when they heard the translation of Jackson's opening statement? How did the defendants seem when they were in the dock hearing Jackson's opening statement?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: I can't really give you information on that.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Okay.</P>

<P>SPRECHER: I can give you information on another thing that happened about three days later, which indicates something that happened in the dock, but--</P>

<P>QUESTION: Okay.</P>

<P>SPRECHER: --that's another matter.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Okay. What was that?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: About three days after the trial started, Justice Jackson asked me to accompany Senator Claude Pepper, who was visiting Nuremberg and stayed there for at least two weeks at the beginning of the trial.</P>

<P>So I took Pepper in and sat him down at the prosecution table. Just before the recess, break in the, the proceedings, I noticed that the defendant, Goering, had broken his pencil and thrown it down in the dock and stood their very angrily.</P>

<P>So I took my pencil and I went up to the guard beside the dock and said, Goering broke his pencil. And he handed Goering the pencil. I went back and sat down, and a recess came along. And Sen. Pepper and I stood up, and suddenly Senator-- Sen. Pepper said, Sprecher, this fellow Goering is trying to get hold of you. So I turned around and here was Goering. So I went up near him -- couldn't approach too close -- and the guard said go ahead. And I said, "what did you have?"</P>

<P>And he says, "danke viel mals, danke viel mals." And I said, "bitte sehr, bitte sehr." And that's the only conversation I had with Goering. You get the translation. I said, "I thank you very much, I thank you very much." That's what he said.</P>

<P>And I said, "You're-- I'm very pleased to have helped you, I'm very pleased to have helped you."</P>

<P>QUESTION: Now, do you know anything about Jackson's relationship with Judge Biddle?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: No. I -- there's something about it written up in Judge Biddle's book, as I recall. But I have no, in independent information of that at all.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Okay. What were the biggest problems that the U.S. prosecutors faced at Nuremberg?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Well, I would say the first big problem was that we didn't have enough German speaking people there. Very few of the attorneys themselves spoke German.</P>

<P>And accordingly they had to rely on research analysts. And there weren't enough good research analysts to both do the finding of the documents and then their translation.</P>

<P>So we had a translation bog down during the first part of the trial, which was most unfortunate. And had we done what we later did under Lt. Col. Peter Eberal, and sent a whole team to England to have recruited more German speaking people of the first rank, we would have saved ourselves a lot of grief at the beginning of the first trial.</P>

<P>QUESTION: And as the trial went forward, as the first trial went forward, what other challenges did the U.S. prosecutors face?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Well, one of the main problems of the prosecution overall was that there wasn't any great correlation between the four delegations. There was between the Americans and the British, partly because Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe was such a, a wonderful diplomacist, and a man of unusual ability and character.</P>

<P>But the relations with both the French and the Soviets were not that close that you could work things out very well. Had their been one overall Chief Prosecutor who could have pulled things together, it would have saved a lot of time. And there wouldn't have been as much repetition.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Did the Soviets perceive the -- did the Soviet prosecutors perceive Nuremberg as just another political show trial?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: No, I don't know what you mean by another political show trial. I think they had a great interest, a very genuine interest in having exposed what happened. Because after all, they had lost more people than anybody else had lost, due to the Nazi invasion, and due to the occupation practices after that. So they had a very good reason to want a very full exposition.</P>

<P>The major difference was that they tended to rely themselves on official reports, some of which were good, and some were, which were a little distended by prosecution type language, you might say.</P>

<P>Whereas our idea was to rely as much as possible on the contemporaneous German documents.</P>

<P>And as the trial went along, I think the Soviets learned more from that. And, and for that matter, the French, the French did too.</P>

<P>QUESTION: What were the goals of the French at Nuremberg?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Well, they mainly wanted to expose what had happened to the countries in the west during the German occupation. And the main difficulty was that they were so overcome and overwhelmed by the defeat and their government hadn't really been reconstituted well.</P>

<P>And they sent all kinds of miscellaneous things to Nuremberg which hadn't been certified. And it was very difficult for us to, to get them to follow Anglo-Saxon standards in getting their, their documents and their other proof together.And I think some of them did. But some of them were still kind of learning about the process.</P>

<P>You see, there's a difference between continental law, and the Anglo-Saxon law. In the Anglo-Saxon law, the prosecutors tend to pour in their materials. The judge looks it all over. And then the judge takes the leadership in questioning and so forth.</P>

<P>That's quite different than in the Anglo-Saxon process, where the judge knows practically nothing before the trial starts. And it's up to the prosecution to do all the leadership in presenting the evidence.</P>

<P>QUESTION: What about the conspiracy charge? Wasn't that a new notion to the French and Russian and German lawyers at Nuremberg?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Well, partly it was. The main problem in my view, the conspiracy charge was that we made it too broad. And we said the Nazi conspirators, meaning all the men in the dock, plus some others, did so and so.</P>

<P>Now, as a matter of fact, there were very great variations among the defendants and others as to what they did, and why they did it.</P>

<P>And the tribunal cut the conspiracy charge back a great deal, and had it start in November, 1937. And they found only ten of the de-- these defendants guilty. And many other people, of course, were therefore not involved at all in this narrower conspiracy. Our mistake was making too broad a mis-- conspiracy charge.</P>

<P>The -- the French, the Germans and the Russians have some notion of conspiracy, but it's a much more limited one than ours was. And so the final result was closer, moved more in their direction and less in the Anglo-Saxon direction than was the case at the beginning of the trial.</P>

<P>QUESTION: What were the mistakes that were made at Nuremberg?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Well, there were several very large mistakes. In the first place, the in-- accusation that the Nazi leaders, the Nazi regime, had committed the Katyn massacres. That was pushed upon the prosecution during the last couple days before the indictment was filed, when they were assembled in Berlin and waiting to file the indictment with the judges.</P>

<P>And the other prosecutors, the Americans and the British, should have objected. But they didn't have the details. And besides, they were under some pressure. As a result, the Soviets got away with it. And it was put into the indictment.</P>

<P>At the trial, after the Americans and the British and the French began to see that this was probably a, a very clouded thing, they refused to put in any evidence or to mention it in any way. When the tribunal came to write its judgment, the Katyn matter is not mentioned one bit either. So it just fell out of the case. But it was a disturbing element.</P>

<P>QUESTION: What were some of the other mistakes?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Well, one of the other mistakes was the indictment, in my view, of Hjalmar Schacht. Schacht had indicated some variations from Goering which were rather substantial, before the war. And then he'd gone into almost complete retirement.</P>

<P>During the last part of the war, he undoubtedly had some connections with some of the conspirators who attempted to take the life of Hitler on July 20th, 1944. Now, how close those were, we don't know. Schacht maybe later blew it up a bit.</P>

<P>But it was very clear that we had not gone sufficiently into Schacht's background. After all, Hitler had him thrown in concentration camps nearly a year before the trial began. And he was in several concentration camps. Because Hitler thought he was guilty of having conspired against Hitler. Well, that's not the kind of a man to put in the dock, and we made a mistake.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Were you present in the courtroom when the concentration camp film was introduced?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Yes.</P>

<P>QUESTION: What was the atmosphere in the courtroom like when the concentration film was shown? And was the reaction to it?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Well, the concentration camp film had been put together by a good friend of mine, Jim Donovan, from the Office of Strategic Services. So I'd even seen parts of it beforehand. I was not particularly surprised at what was shown.</P>

<P>But the horrors of seeing the bodies stacked up and the ditches and the movement of so many people onto trains and into the concentration camps was a shocking thing to see. And it affected the audience very much. You could feel it at the time it happened.</P>

<P>QUESTION: How did the defendants react?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Well, I was busy watching the film at the time. And of course, the, the court was, the lights were different during that showing otherwise. So I don't know. But I think Speer revealed, the defendant, Speer, revealed later that he thought this is one of the things that helped him create some division among the defendants. Because it was so obvious that the Hitler regime had committed some of these horrible atrocities associated with the communication camps.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Now, why was, why was the film introduced?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: I think as a dramatic way of showing some of the evils that had happened. I think it was, it was perfectly legitimate to show the film for that purpose.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Do you, do you think the U.S. case was too reliant upon documents?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: No. I don't think that the U.S. case was too reliant upon documents. I think that at first, Jackson probably wanted to use documents and have very few witnesses. But he was persuaded that he ought to have at least several. And so we had several very good prosecution witnesses.</P>

<P>QUESTION: And, and why was he persuaded to have witnesses? What were the arguments?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: I think one of the main things was to get a break in the trial. And just avoid the constant repetition of things about documents. And that the live witnesses kind of brought the whole thing to life in a way that the documents did not.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Why did the U.S. prosecute the Nazi organizations?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: The hope in prosecuting the Nazi organizations was that it would save a lot of time in prosecuting individuals. And I, again, I think there we went a little far, as the tribunal pointed out in its findings. What we were attempting to do is make a prime facie case, which would be very difficult for defendants in later trials to rebut.</P>

<P>But the tribunal said the prosecution must prove that the defendant in a later trial knew these things that went on about the -- of a particular organization that was accused of being criminal.</P>

<P>The tribunal also threw out three of the cases on the, that we had, we had indicted the Reich Cabinet, that was thrown out. We had indicated the Storm Troops, the S.A., that was thrown out. A lot of people were worried about that one, but when you look back at it, the S.A. had had such an up and down history that it probably was just as well that it was thrown out.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Now, how much did the sort of looming Cold War tensions effect the tribunal?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: How it effected the tribunal, I don't know.</P>

<P>QUESTION: How did it effect the prosecutors?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Well, the relationships between the Americans, as far as I saw it, and the Soviet prosecution became less friendly and less open as the trial went along. This is partly because of the Cattine matter.</P>

<P>But it was also because, well, I can give you a precise example. I was in charge of developing the Fritzsche case, one of the three defendants who was found not guilty. And as I did this, I was given a confession, which the Soviets had gotten from Fritzsche in Berlin, and which they brought down to Nuremberg.</P>

<P>It had in it some good materials, but it sounded a little stretched in places. So I was a little concerned about it. Dr. Kempner, a German-American who was on the prosecution, knew I was working with the British in developing Fritche's broadcasts and one thing and another.</P>

<P>And some of these broadcasts constantly had Fritzsche -- speaking of the Bolshevistic Internationalistic Jewish Capitalistic conspiracy. And he'd mix these things all up and, and shout them out.</P>

<P>And I had chosen at least twenty or so of these, and had them translated and put into documentary form. Of course, this was circulated to the Russians. So they asked to see us. And Colonel Storey had me and had Commander Albrecht and I brought together with them.</P>

<P>And they said, can't you cut this out somewhat? It's so awful to be charged so many times by, by Fritzsche. So I think we said, well, we could cut out one or two of them. But we thereupon went and added several more that were just like them.</P>

<P>But they weren't happy about having to face up to all the, the, the dirty things the Nazis had said about them. And I, I don't see why. That was stupid. It was certainly true that they asked for this conference.</P>

<P>QUESTION: How do you feel about Jackson's cross-examination of Goering?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Well, most of it was very good. Most of Justice Jackson's cross-examination of Goering was good. He started out well and so forth. But when he got to the point where Jackson was giving him quite a few long answers and he, he lost his temper, which was unfortunate.</P>

<P>QUESTION: What are your thoughts on Jackson's cross-examination of Goering?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: I think most of his cross-examination was a very good. A lot of the things he got Goering to admit and to come out with during the first part of his exam was very good. But as he went along and tried to pin Goering down, he began to ask questions which kind of irritated Goering. And Goering started to give him very long answers.</P>

<P>Jackson became angry. And he showed it. And that was most unfortunate. And that's the only time I remember him getting angry in court. He never got angry when he cross-examined Schacht, nor when he cross-examined Speer. He kept his temper very well and did a good job.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Do you believe the defendants at Nuremberg received an adequate defense?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: I think that the defendants at Nuremberg received a, a very adequate defense. They had some very good counsel. I think Otto Kranzbuehler is one of the brightest counsel I've seen anywhere. He was very clever in the way he presented the case of Doenitz. And by getting an affidavit from Admiral Nimitz, our Admiral Nimitz, he in effect made the prosecution back up on some things.</P>

<P>And the finding with respect to illegal and unrestricted submarine warfare is a very restricted one. Had largely to do with the shooting of survivors after the submarines had been sunk and so forth. So -- he was one example.</P>

<P>The other thing is, the other good example is Dr. Rudolf Dix, who was the President of the German Bar Association, before the Nazis came to power. And I think he was a very capable lawyer. There were a number of others who were very good lawyers.</P>

<P>QUESTION: What were your impressions of Judge--</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Let me go back to one thing--</P>

<P>QUESTION: I'll start off and ask you about the first day you walked in the courtroom and sat in the balcony and so on. And then I will ask you that, the defense lawyers had some unusual resources to draw upon. Have you explain that.</P>

<P>SPRECHER: All right. Start me off.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Tell me about the first time you walked into the courtroom?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: The first time I came into the courtroom during the trial was just before the defendants were brought into the dock. And as they were brought in by a guard, one by one, and sat down where they knew they were going to sit, because there had been a preview for them, as I saw them coming in there, I could hardly really believe it's finally happening. And I must say, tears came to my eyes.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Had there been a lot of delays before the trial started?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: No. There hadn't been any particular delays before the trial started. We were very crowded, but once the indictment was served, I don't think anybody had any desire to have the date of trial moved backward or forward. They wanted it to come off just as it had been set forth.</P>

<P>It pushed us a good deal, but it really came off very well.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Was there a sense of history about it? Did you have the sense that you were making history?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: I think everybody had the sense that, what with the documents we had, and what with the drama of the trial, we were helping make history, and that we were doing it in a way which would call attention to many more people than could possibly be done if there had been no trial.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Now, the German defense lawyers had some unusual resources to draw upon. Tell us about that.</P>

<P>SPRECHER: The German defense counsel were a rather unusual bunch. And they had some difficulties traveling at first, because they were not accustomed to the difficulties in getting around Germany which existed at that time. And I must say, we gave them a lot of help, otherwise they wouldn't have gotten around.</P>

<P>But one of the things that most freed up the defense counsel was the fact that there were some defendants in the jail who were also lawyers. And we allowed them to use these lawyers to help them develop proposed affidavits. And particularly in connection with the accused organizations.</P>

<P>They really did a lot of the tabulating as to how many affidavits there were. They consolidated some of them. And they were a considerable help to the defense counsel.</P>

<P>QUESTION: What were your impressions of Judge Lawrence?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Judge Lawrence was one of the most amazing people I ever hope to see on the bench or off the bench. He had a firmness about him, and yet a, he didn't sound, nor did he behave in a arbitrary fashion. And he seemed to listen and remember great amounts of detail as to what had gone on before, and what had been said.</P>

<P>And when he was wrong, he didn't hesitate to admit it. I think that between him and Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, and Justice Jackson, you have the three big characters of the trial.</P>

<P>QUESTION: What were your impressions of Sir Hartley Shawcross?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: I didn't get to know him at all well. But his, his main contribution in my way of thinking came toward the end of the trial, when he made a closing statement which was as long as I think anybody else's statement, but it was so good that it didn't bother us very much to have it be so long.</P>

<P>He was a very articulate man, and he'd had a lot of good help from some very articulate British co-counsel.</P>

<P>QUESTION: What was the atmosphere like in Nuremberg outside the courtroom?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Well, of course, the, the Germans at the time, or particularly during the early part of the trial, were having such a difficult time in getting enough food to subsist on. And Nuremberg had tremendous numbers of the people in the center of Nuremberg had moved out to the suburbs or some distance away because of the heavy bombing and the heavy shelling of Nuremberg.</P>

<P>They started to come on back in. And you would begin to see more Germans walking up and down the streets. And clearing the great debris, and clearing the streets and so on. There was a lot of jobs that were created for the Germans. And accordingly, the, the --downtrodden appearance of the average German tended to become less apparent. And they began more and more to, to look like restored human beings.</P>

<P>QUESTION: What was the attitude of the German people toward the trial?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: I think it was -- there was a, a set of different attitudes, in that they changed as the trial went on. At the beginning, I think a lot of the Germans felt this is just the victors over the vanquished kind of thing.</P>

<P>But when they began to see that there were not only defense counsel, but that the German witnesses were testifying about what they had experienced, which showed crimes by the Nazi regime, then I think there tended to be a great change and a great more recep--receptivity to listening to what was going on at the trial, both by radio and through the newspapers.</P>

<P>And as the Germans got better rations, why they had more chance to really think, too, about what was going on. We, during the la--the later trials, I was on a program right in the courtroom where we invited in youth groups, the leaders of youth groups, and quite a few young Germans.</P>

<P>And they were free to ask any questions they wanted. We put them in, right in the defendants' dock. And we put them right at the prosecution tables. And three or four of us agreed to answer any questions they asked. And this received a lot of publicity. So we did what we could to help get the word across to the Germans in more ways than just having the trial.</P>

<P>QUESTION: What was the city of Nuremberg like during the trial? What did it look like?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: The city of Nuremberg was really an unbelievable place to behold. When we flew in, when I flew in, in the middle of July, 1945, the pilot circled the city several times quite low, so that we could see the devastation. And as you got to the center part of that city, I mean, you could see from the air, it's the buil-- the remnants of buildings. Almost no paths through the streets. It was a horrible sight to behold from the air.</P>

<P>And then in the next couple days, when we had a little time to walk into the old city, there were places, most places you couldn't go anywhere at all. And within those first few weeks, one of the main jobs was moving debris aside, so that there was at least a pathway through some of those streets.</P>

<P>And seeing a shelled cathedral was a horrible experience, when you realized that that art, and that beautiful structure had been ruined by bombing and shelling. And probably never properly con-- reconstituted.</P>

<P>After a while, it would be very difficult to do it. A lot of art was lost because of the shelling and the bombing.</P>

<P>QUESTION: What was the, what was the -- let me start over. What was the most unexpected thing that happened during the trial to you?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: I suppose that one of the most unexpected things to me only partly showed up at the trial. And it came out partly when we heard that Speer was going to assume a certain collective guilt, because he had been associated so intimately with the regime that had done many things.</P>

<P>And even though he was going to say I didn't know some of the details of the horrors, he was going to take some responsibility for that. I suppose when that began to come out, during his testimony, that was as surprising a thing to me as happened during the trial.</P>

<P>QUESTION: What did you expect that Speer would do?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Well, I hadn't known of him personally to speak of at all. I probably had been at an interrogation before the trial. But it never struck me as it had the prison psychologist, Dr. Gilbert. Dr. Gilbert damn well knew that Speer was going to assume responsibility for quite a few things.</P>

<P>But we never had any contact with Dr. Gilbert during the trial. He stayed away from the prosecution like mad. I mean, really. I don't, I never shook his hand. And I don't know anybody else that did. He wanted to keep that role, so that he could say to the defendants, look, I'm your psychologist. And nobody else's.</P>

<P>Now that his book has been out many years, I've seen how it corroborates what, what Speer was thinking. He built a kind of a opposition to Goering within and among the defendants, which was really quite substantial. It even effected one of my two defendants, Von Schirach. Von Schirach came around and finally made the statement, "I have led millions of German youth to serve a barbaric master."</P>

<P>I might tell you what, how I concluded my peroration in the, the Von Schirach case.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Go right ahead.</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Okay. Von Schirach, after he became Gauleiter of Vienna, drew together a number of leaders of youth groups from the occupied countries that the Germans were dominating and, and getting under their propaganda influence. And then at one point, Sherach said, if I have sent thousands upon thousands of Jews into the ghettos of the east, "I consider it a service to humanity." Well, he not only made that statement, but it was published in the "Volkische Vermachter" in the official German newspaper in Vienna.</P>

<P>When I found that out, I knew immediately what my peroration was going to be, when I presented the case against Von Schirach. And I said, "Your honors, I think you'd be interested in knowing, as I conclude my remarks, the words that Schirach said." And then I repeated these words. And it was quite effective.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Nuremberg has been called a meaningless triumph of international law. Do you agree?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: No. I don't agree at all. I do think that it is only beginning now to fulfill its true legacy, its full legacy. Because there have been conferences all over, and a tremendous number of legal professionals have thought about the trial and its implications. And how it is different than the situations which have arisen since.</P>

<P>I mean, in Bosnia we just don't have physical possession. We haven't captured the leading defendants. In Nuremberg, we had them all. So, it made a lot of difference. I, of course, think that they should have indicted the top Serbian leaders months ago, and tried them in absentia, in their absence. If they had notice, they could come. And if they didn't want to come, why we'd use what evidence we had.</P>

<P>And I think it would have stopped some of the crimes which have been committed since. And that it would have given a good leeway, a good headstart on having some further tri-- trials now.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Do you, do you think the rule of law can be effective after a trial in which the defendant isn't present?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Well, take the case of Bormann in the first trial. He was, he was tried in absentia. He was the closest man to Hitler during the last couple of years of the war. This was brought out very clearly. And had he been there -- of course, he was dead we found out later. We weren't sure at the time we indicted him.</P>

<P>But had he-- wanted to bring out evidence, and had he been alive, he could have done this. If, by sending letters or by sending materials to his counsel. Or he could have insisted on being present.</P>

<P>In the case of the Yugoslavs, they could have said, well, we'll want to come and be present wherever the trial is being held. If they didn't, that's their choice.</P>

<P>QUESTION: What were the most fiercely debated issues within the American prosecution team?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Well, now I can't, of course, speak very much about the top -- about Justice Jackson and whoever he may have had some issues with. I know that Colonel Aman, the head of the Interrogation Division, did feel there should be more witnesses. There were some disagreements about that.</P>

<P>As far as the assist trial counsel were concerned, I don't really recall that there was any grave scraps among them. If you have any examples, I'll be glad to respond to them.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Are there any--</P>

<P>SPRECHER: That doesn't mean we all thought the same. But I, I don't think this got to the level of being a set of issues among any of the lesser prosecutors.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Are there any defendants you think were treated too lightly by the tribunal?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Yes. I-- I think that Fritzsche, the defendant I prosecuted, he was clearly a, a man down at the third level. And he shouldn't have been in the dock, because of that reason. But after he was there, I think that the tribunal could have tied together the in-- infuriating statements he made concerning Jews and capitalists and imperialists and so on, and found that he also contributed to the will of the total Nazi regime to liquidate Jews.</P>

<P>The difference between his case and the Streicher case was the Streicher had read a Swiss newspaper, the "Israeleidische Volkenblacht" in which it talked about the removal of the Jews to the east, and that they were disappearing and not being heard of again. And he printed this from the "Israeleidische Volkenblacht" and then he said, this is no goddamn Jewish lie. Well, there we had proof that he knew that they were being eliminated in the concentration camps. This was pretty thin in the case of Fritzsche. But he had been behind the Russian, the, the German armies when they went into the Soviet Union and when a million people had been killed.</P>

<P>He had been right next to Von Neurath, who was right next to Goebbels, who certainly knew. And why didn't he do a little more inquiring in order to find out what was happening to these thousands upon thousands of Jews that he knew were being taken out of Germany, Austria, and other places? Why didn't he?</P>

<P>I thought he could have been found to have been criminally negligent in that regard. The tribunal just wanted more proof on that than we gave them. And so he was found not guilty.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Do you think the tribunal treated Speer too lightly?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: I think that all depends. I think Speer was as responsible as Salko was for the fact that so many slave laborers were drawn into Germany. But I think the tribunal was moved by the fact that Speer was more contrite, and that he was more open.</P>

<P>And I can't help but think that that was one of the reasons why they reduced his sentence to 20 years. And I'm very glad they did. Because Speer has produced at least two books, "Inside the Third Reich," and the book about Spandau, which are tremendous contributions to world history.</P>

<P>QUESTION: What was Justice Jackson's attitude about the death penalty?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: I have no special knowledge of that.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Okay.</P>

<P>SPRECHER: I mean, I know he sought it. But I, I don't know anything more than that.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Okay. Okay. Were there any defendants who you felt the tribunal treated too harshly?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: No. I -- I didn't feel that they treated any defendant too harshly. You have a particular case in mind?</P>

<P>QUESTION: No. Not necessarily. Did it trouble you at all that these defendants were executed?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: No, it didn't. And now that has an interesting reflection back on my past, because I was against the death penalty as a student at the University of Wisconsin.</P>

<P>But when I began to hear about the Nazi crimes, and their extent, it did seem to me that it would be very bad to let most of these people survive all this and not to make the world know that they had paid for it with their lives. So I had a change of mind about the death penalty in that respect.</P>

<P>QUESTION: I want to go back to something, and that is, were you in the courtroom when the Nazi plan film was shown?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Yes.</P>

<P>QUESTION: What, what was the impact of the Nazi plan film?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Well, I, I think it was a moving film. But I, I, I didn't particularly talk about it to, to other people. I, of course, heard from Gilbert and so on that the, it -- it had quite an influence among the defendants and caused some, a lot of talk among, among them. But I don't know from -- I don't have any specific reactions of my own.</P>

<P>QUESTION: And it didn't have -- so far as you could tell -- a big effect on the courtroom and the, the people who were watching it?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Oh, I think it had an, a considerable effect. But it was not the kind of thing which caused me or my associates to talk about a great deal. I think we were loading in so much evidence that we just assumed that another way of showing what the Nazis has done was good, in addition to the documents. And we kind of left it there.</P>

<P>QUESTION: What is Nuremberg's legacy?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Well, I think it's a multiple legacy. I think the legacy of Nuremberg is partly to make people think at an earlier point about potential dictators and how they themselves get tied into a regime which begins to take shortcuts, and which sooner or later starts to kill its opposition. First some of its own people.</P>

<P>The German -- the -- as Justice Jackson said, the first victims of the Nazi regime were the German people. And then he went, went out and spread to other folks.</P>

<P>I think one of the legacies of Nuremberg was to make us look more at potential dictators and to try to nip them in the bud at a sooner rate.</P>

<P>Another thing about, another part of the legacy would be we need to have a permanent establishment that is ready to go and hunt war crimes and develop materials on war crimes very early, and not have to put together a last minute group of people.</P>

<P>Now, I think we did reasonably well at the end of the war, because we had so much money and people were so anxious to do things. But at the present time, for instance, to have a ten-- temporary tribunal for Yugoslavia is kind of a very laxidasical halfway measure.</P>

<P>And that had we had a, a permanent tribunal ready to go with trained people, of high stature, we'd have been a lot further down the road than we are today.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Is there, is there anything you would like to say? Any questions that we should have asked, that we haven't asked?</P>

<P>QUESTION: What was the funniest thing that happened during the trial?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Well -- one of the funny things that happened during the trial is right on the record. A fellow by the name of Von Steingracht who was the Secretary of the s-- number two man one of the number two men in the Foreign Office, was on the stand.</P>

<P>And he was asked by Col. Aman if he hadn't been at Ashkan. Now, Ashkan was the name of a detention center where many of the defendants had been. And when Aman asked him about that, the translator translated, now you were in an a-- you were incarcentrated in an ash can. And he says, no, I was never incarcetrated in an ash can. And there was just this missing of the, the words in the translation. And the whole audience burst into laughter. And Lord Lawrence had a hard time not laughing himself.</P>

<P>And I'm told that after a while, when he got in chambers, that he laughed like mad as, as well.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Nuremberg has been criticized as being an instrument in which laws were applied retroactively to crimes that had already been committed. How do you respond to that?</P>

<P>SPRECHER: Well, the ex post facto argument has some relevance with respect to crimes against the peace. However, from 1899, 1906 and later, at the Hague, and -- there was a Hague convention, and the Geneva convention, which proscribed certain things which are not to be done during wars, or to -- treatment not to be given to prisoners of war and so forth.</P>

<P>So there was that body of international law that existed with respect to what we called strict war crimes. The idea that there was a crime against the peace requires, when it seems to me to go to the Kellogg-Briand pact of 1926, which was called the Pact to Outlaw War -- Outlaw War. But it didn't prescribe criminal penalties. So what Nur-- the charter at Nuremberg was a build on to that in the sense that it provided a tribunal, and a means of prosecuting persons who had out-- been a part of committing the crime against peace.</P>

<P>QUESTION: I see. Okay. Thank you very much. Again, is there anything else you would like to tell us--</P>

<P>SPRECHER: I don't think so at the moment.</P>

<P>QUESTION: Okay.</P>

<h2>The Trial's Legacy</h2>

<P>Fifty years ago this month, Associate United States Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson made the opening statement in what would become known as the Nuremberg war crimes trial.</P>

<P>"The privilege of opening the first trial in history for crimes against the peace of the world imposes a great responsibility," Jackson told the International Military Tribunal. "The four great nations flushed with victory and stung with injury, stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law.</P>

<P>"The crimes which we seek to condemn and punish have been so calculated, so malignant and so devastating, that civilization cannot tolerate their being ignored, because it cannot survive their being repeated," he said.</P>

<P>During the next ten months, prosecutors from the four victorious powers -- the United States, Great Britain, France and Russia -- presented their case against 22 Nazi leaders.  In trying to fix German guilt, the prosecutors had charged the defendants with conspiring and launching aggressive war and committing war crimes and crimes against humanity. </P>

<P>In the end, three of the defendants were acquitted. Eight received long prison sentences and the rest were sentenced to death. At 10:45 p.m. on October 15, 1946, Hermann Goering cheated the hangman with a cyanide capsule. Two hours later, the executions began.</P>

<P>The trial of Goering, Rudolf Hess, Albert Speer and the others was part show trial and part noble effort to create new international law in the face of crimes that negated civilization's progress. To some extent, it reflected the optimistic sentiments for world cooperation (which were rapidly eclipsed by the Cold War) that led to the creation of the United Nations. It was a political effort to find human-sized justice for crimes that were so hideous. </P>

<P>This was the trial of the century. In the words of  Norman Birkett, who served as a British alternate judge: it was "the greatest trial in history."</P>

<P>A Special Court TV Presentation<BR>
Beginning November 13, 1995, Court TV broadcast 15 hours of Nuremberg. It was the most extensive coverage of the trial ever broadcast.</P>

<P>Some of the trial was filmed by the U.S. Army Signal Corps, Soviet cameramen and commercial newsreel companies such as Paramount and Universal. But there were many days when nothing was filmed.</P>

<P>A nearly complete record of the proceedings does exist on audio tape, recorded as it was spoken in the four languages of the trial - English, German, French and Russian.  Court TV's broadcast supplemented selected portions of the existing film with audio tape. Where only audio exists, we added still photographs or film that was shot in the courtroom during that particular portion of the trial.</P>

<P>The cameras of the mid-1940s used 35 mm film on 10-minute reels. There were no zoom lenses, so cameramen used turret lenses that held close-up, normal and long lenses. Cameramen switched lenses while shooting and often did not focus after a lens change. The footage was shot and edited for newsreels that were shown in movie theaters, and choices about what was shot reflected the needs of the newsreel companies. The cameras often were placed at awkward angles to avoid disrupting the proceedings.</P>

<P>As stated earlier, the proceedings were held in four languages. All documents were to be translated and made available in each language, and a team of translators was employed. But the sheer volume of the material insured that the translators could not keep up.</P>

<P>The Legacy of Nuremberg<BR>
In the view of most historians, Nuremberg's legacy is mixed. They are generally favorable to the attempt made by the Allies to bring some form of international judicial accounting for the horrors of the Nazi regime. To this day, Nuremberg remains the most thorough record of Hitler's rise to power, and the planning, launching and execution of World War II. As such, it was no small achievement, and one that was forged out of the chaos and rubble immediately following World War II.</P>

<P>But some argue that the International Military Tribunal was a victor's justice, and the trial has been criticized for a variety of reasons. The list of those accused was somewhat arbitrary. There also were basic misgivings. The accused had been charged with violations of international law, but such law was binding on nations, not individuals. Individuals, it was argued, could be brought to justice only under the laws of their own country, not on the basis of a new order established after a war. It may have been imperfect justice, but there was no alternative.</P>

<P>Nuremberg has never fulfilled its brightest promise -- a permanent international tribunal for war crimes. Various efforts have been made in the ensuing half century, but all have languished. Only recently, with the establishment of the U.N.'s International Criminal Tribunal that is addressing war crimes in the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, have the ideals set at Nuremberg taken a tangible form.</P>

<P>The final business of Nuremberg remains unfinished.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Before the defendants in this case are called upon to make their pleas to the Indictment which has been lodged against them, and in which they are charged with Crimes against Peace War Crimes, and Crimes against Humanity, and with a Common Plan or Conspiracy to commit those crimes, it is the wish of the Tribunal that I should make a very brief statement on behalf of the Tribunal.</P>

<P>This International Military Tribunal has been established pursuant to the Agreement of London, dated the 8/8/1945, and the Charter of the Tribunal as annexed thereto, and the purpose for which the Tribunal has been established is stated in Article 1 of the Charter to be the just and prompt trial and punishment of the major war criminals of the European Axis.</P>

<P>The Signatories to the Agreement and Charter are the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Government of the United States of America, the Provisional Government of the French Republic, and the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.</P>

<P>The Committee of the Chief Prosecutors, appointed by the four Signatories, have settled the final designation of the war criminals to be tried by the Tribunal, and have approved the Indictment on which the present defendants stand charged here today.</P>

<P>On Thursday, the 10/18/1945, in Berlin, the Indictment was lodged with the Tribunal and a copy of that Indictment in the German language has been furnished to each defendant, and has been in his possession for more than 30 days.</P>

<P>All the defendants are represented by counsel. In almost all Cases the counsel appearing for the defendants have been chosen by the defendants themselves, but in cases where counsel could not be obtained the Tribunal has itself selected suitable counsel agreeable to the defendant.</P>

<P>The Tribunal has heard with great satisfaction of the steps which have been taken by the Chief Prosecutors to make available to defending counsel the numerous documents upon which the Prosecution rely, with the aim of giving to the defendants every possibility for a just defense.</P>

<P>The Trial which is now about to begin is unique in the history, of the Jurisprudence of the world and it is of supreme importance to millions of people all over the globe. For these reasons, there is laid upon everybody who takes any part in this Trial a solemn responsibility to discharge their duties without fear or favor, in accordance with the sacred principles of law and justice.</P>

<P>The four Signatories having invoked the judicial process, it is the duty of all concerned to see that the Trial in no way departs from those principles and traditions which alone give justice its authority and the place it ought to occupy in the affairs of all civilized states.</P>

<P>This Trial is a public Trial in the fullest sense of those words and I must, therefore, remind the public that the Tribunal will insist upon the complete maintenance of order and decorum, and will take the strictest measures to enforce it. It only remains for me to direct, in accordance with the provisions of the Charter, that the Indictment shall now be read.</P>

<P>Reference: the Charter, Article 6, especially Article 6 (a).</P>

<P>III. Statement of the Offense.</P>

<P>All the defendants, with divers other persons, during a period of years preceding 5/8/1945, participated as leaders, organizers, instigators, or accomplices in the formulation or execution of a Common Plan or Conspiracy to commit, or which involved the commission of, Crimes against Peace, War Crimes, and Crimes against Humanity, as defined in the Charter of this Tribunal, and, in accordance with the provisions of the Charter, are individually responsible for their own acts and for all acts committed by any persons in the execution of such plan and conspiracy. The Common Plan or Conspiracy embraced the commission of Crimes against Peace, in that the defendants planned, prepared, initiated, and waged wars of aggression, which were also wars in violation of international treaties, agreements, or assurances. In the development and course of the Common Plan or Conspiracy it came to embrace the commission of War Crimes, in that it contemplated, and the defendants determined upon and carried out, ruthless wars against countries and populations, in violation of the rules and customs of war, including as typical and systematic means by which the wars were Prosecuted, murder, ill-treatment, deportation for slave labor and for other purposes of civilian populations of occupied territories, murder and ill-treatment of prisoners of war and of persons on the High Seas, the taking and killing of hostages, the plunder of public and private property, the wanton destruction of cities, towns, and Villages, and devastation not justified by military necessity. The Common Plan or Conspiracy contemplated and came to embrace as typical and systematic means, and the defendants determined upon and Committed Crimes against Humanity, both within Germany and within occupied territories, including murder, extermination, enslavement deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against civilian populations before and during the war, and persecutions on political, racial, or religious grounds, in execution of the plan for preparing and prosecuting aggressive or illegal wars, man. of such acts and persecutions being violations of the domestic law of the countries where perpetrated.</P>

<P>IV. Particulars of the Nature and Development of the Common Plan or Conspiracy.</P>

<P>(A) The Nazi Party as the central core of the Common Plan or Conspiracy.</P>

<P>In 1921 Adolf Hitler became the supreme leader or Fuehrer of the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (National Socialist German Workers Party), also known as the Nazi Party, which had been founded in Germany in 1920. He continued as such throughout the period covered by this Indictment. The Nazi Party, together with certain of its subsidiary organizations, became the instrument of cohesion among the defendants and their co-conspirators and an instrument for the carrying out of the aims and purposes of their conspiracy. Each defendant became a member of the Nazi Party and of the conspiracy, with knowledge of their aims and purposes, or with such knowledge, became an accessory to their aims and purposes at some stage of the development of the conspiracy.</P>

<P>(B) Common objectives and methods of conspiracy.</P>

<P>The aims and purposes of the Nazi Party and of the defendants and divers other persons from time to time associated as leaders members, supporters, or adherents of the Nazi Party (hereinafter called collectively the "Nazi conspirators") were, or came to be, to accomplish the following by any means deemed opportune, including unlawful means, and contemplating ultimate resort to threat of force, force, and aggressive war: (1) to abrogate and overthrow the Treaty of Versailles and its restrictions upon the military armament and activity of Germany; (2) to acquire the territories lost by Germany as the result of the World War of 1914-18 and other territories in Europe asserted by the Nazi conspirators to be occupied principally by so-called "racial Germans"; (3) to acquire still; further territories in continental Europe and elsewhere claimed by the Nazi conspirators to be required by the "racial Germans" as "Lebensraum," or living space, all at the expense of neighboring and other countries. The aims and purposes of the Nazi conspirator were not fixed or static, but evolved and expanded as they acquired progressively greater power and became able to make more effective application of threats of force and threats of aggressive war When their expanding aims and purposes became finally so great as to provoke such strength of resistance as could be overthrown only by armed force and aggressive war, and not simply by the opportunistic methods theretofore used, such as fraud, deceit, threats, intimidation, fifth-column activities, and propaganda, the Nazi conspirators deliberately planned, determined upon and launched their aggressive wars and wars in violation of international treaties, agreements, and assurances by the phases and steps hereinafter more particularly described.</P>

<P>(C) Doctrinal techniques of the Common Plan or Conspiracy. To incite others to join in the Common Plan or Conspiracy, and a means of securing for the Nazi conspirators their highest degree of control over the German community, they put forth, disseminated, and exploited certain doctrines, among others, as</P>

<P>1. That persons of so-called "German blood" (as specified by the Nazi conspirators) were a "master race" and were accordingly entitled to subjugate, dominate, or exterminate other "races" and peoples;</P>

<P>2. That the German people should be ruled under the Fuehrerprinzip (Leadership Principle) according to which power was to reside in a Fuehrer from whom sub-leaders were to derive authority in a hierarchical order, each sub-leader to owe unconditional obedience to his immediate superior but to be absolute in his own sphere of jurisdiction; and the power of the leadership was to be unlimited, extending to all phases of public and private life;</P>

<P>3. That war was a noble and necessary activity of Germans;</P>

<P>4. That the leadership of the Nazi Party, as the sole bearer of the foregoing and other doctrines of the Nazi Party, was entitled to shape the structure, policies, and practices of the German State and all related institutions, to direct and supervise the activities of all individuals within the State, and to destroy all opponents.</P>

<P>(D) The acquiring of totalitarian control of Germany: political.</P>

<P>1. First steps in acquisition of control of State machinery:</P>

<P>In order to accomplish their aims and purposes, the Nazi conspirators prepared to seize totalitarian control over Germany to assure that no effective resistance against them could arise within Germany itself. After the failure of the Munich Putsch of 1923 aimed at the overthrow of the Weimar Republic by direct action, the Nazi conspirators set out through the Nazi Party to undermine and capture the German Government by "legal" forms supported by terrorism. They created and utilized, as a Party formation, Die Sturmabteilungen (SA), a semi-military, voluntary organization of young men trained for and committed to the use of violence, whose mission was to make the Party the master of the streets.</P>

<P>2. Control acquired:</P>

<P>On 1/30/1933 Hitler became Chancellor of the German Republic. After the Reichstag fire of 2/28/1933, clauses of the Weimar constitution guaranteeing personal liberty, freedom of speech, of the press, of association, and assembly were suspended. The Nazi conspirators secured the passage by the Reichstag of a "Law for the Protection of the People and the Reich" giving Hitler and the members of his then cabinet plenary powers of legislation. The Nazi conspirators retained such powers after having changed the members of the cabinet. The conspirators caused all political parties except the Nazi Party to be prohibited. They caused the Nazi Party to be established as a paragovernmental organization with extensive and extraordinary privileges.</P>

<P>3. Consolidation of control:</P>

<P>Thus possessed of the machinery of the German State, the Nazi conspirators set about the consolidation of their position of power within Germany, the extermination of potential internal resistance and the placing of the German nation on a military footing.</P>

<P>(a) The Nazi conspirators reduced the Reichstag to a body of their own nominees and curtailed the freedom of popular elections throughout the country. They transformed the several states, provinces, and municipalities, which had formerly exercised semi-autonomous powers, into hardly more than administrative organs of the central Government. They united the offices of the President and the Chancellor in the person of Hitler, instituted a widespread purge of civil servants, and severely restricted the independence of the Judiciary and rendered it subservient to Nazi ends. The conspirators greatly enlarged existing State and Party organizations established a network of new State and Party organizations, and co-ordinated State agencies with the Nazi Party and its branches and affiliates, with the result that German life was dominated by Nazi doctrine and practice and progressively mobilized for the accomplishment of their aims.</P>

<P>(b) In order to make their rule secure from attack and to instill fear in the hearts of the German people, the Nazi conspirators established and extended a system of terror against opponents and supposed or suspected opponents of the regime. They imprisoned such persons without judicial process, holding them in "protective custody and concentration camps, and subjected them to persecution, degradation, despoilment, enslavement, torture, and murder. These concentration camps were established early in 1933 under the direction of the Defendant Goering and expanded as a fixed part of the terroristic policy and method of the conspirators and used by them for the commission of the Crimes against Humanity hereinafter alleged. Among the principal agencies utilized the perpetration of these crimes were the SS and the Gestapo, which, together with other favored branches or agencies of the State and Party, were permitted to operate without restraint of law.</P>

<P>(c) The Nazi conspirators conceived that, in addition to the suppression of distinctively political opposition, it was necessary to suppress or exterminate certain other movements or groups which theY regarded as obstacles to their retention of total control in Germany and to the aggressive aims of the conspiracy abroad. Accordingly:</P>

<P>(1) The Nazi conspirators destroyed the free trade unions in Germany by confiscating their funds and properties, persecuting their leaders, prohibiting their activities, and supplanting them by an affiliated Party organization. The Leadership Principle was introduced into industrial relations, the entrepreneur becoming the leader and the workers becoming his followers. Thus any potential resistance of the workers was frustrated and the productive labor capacity of the German nation was brought under the effective control of the conspirators.</P>

<P>(2) The Nazi conspirators, by promoting beliefs and practices incompatible with Christian teaching, sought to subvert the influence of the churches over the people and in particular over the youth of Germany. They avowed their aim to eliminate the Christian churches in Germany and sought to substitute therefore Nazi institutions and Nazi beliefs and pursued a program of persecution of priests, clergy, and members of monastic orders whom they deemed opposed to their purposes, and confiscated church property.</P>

<P>(3) The persecution by the Nazi conspirators of pacifist groups, including religious movements dedicated to pacifism, was particularly relentless and cruel.</P>

<P>(d) Implementing their "master race" policy, the conspirators joined in a program of relentless persecution of the Jews, designed to exterminate them. Annihilation of the Jews became an official state policy, carried out both by official action and by incitements to mob and individual violence. The conspirators openly avowed their purpose For example, the Defendant Rosenberg stated:</P>

<P>Anti-semitism is the unifying element of the reconstruction of Germany. On another occasion he also stated: Germany will regard the Jewish question as solved only after the very last Jew has left the greater German living Space .... Europe will have its Jewish question solved only after the very last Jew has left the continent. The Defendant Ley declared:</P>

<P>"We swear we are not going to abandon the struggle until the last Jew in Europe has been exterminated and is actually dead. It is not enough to isolate the Jewish enemy of mankindthe Jew has got to be exterminated."</P>

<P>On another occasion he also declared:</P>

<P>"The second German secret weapon is anti-Semitism, because if it is consistently pursued by Germany, it will become a universal problem which all nations will be forced to consider." The Defendant Streicher declared:</P>

<P>"The sun will not shine on the nations of the earth until the last Jew is dead."</P>

<P>These avowals and incitements were typical of the declarations of the Nazi conspirators throughout the course of their conspiracy. The program of action against the Jews included disfranchisement. stigmatization, denial of civil liberties, subjecting their persons and property to violence, deportation, enslavement, enforced labor, starvation, murder and mass extermination. The extent to which the conspirators succeeded in their purpose can only be estimated, but the annihilation was substantially complete in many localities of Europe. Of the 9.6 million Jews who lived in the parts of Europe under Nazi domination, it is conservatively estimated that 5.7 million have disappeared, most of them deliberately put to death by the Nazi conspirators. Only remnants of the Jewish population of Europe remain.</P>

<P>(e) In order to make the German people amenable to their will. and to prepare them psychologically for war, the Nazi conspirators reshaped the educational system and particularly the education and training of the German youth. The Leadership Principle was introduced into the schools, and the Party and affiliated organizations were given wide supervisory powers over education. The Nazi conspirators imposed a supervision of all cultural activities, controlled the dissemination of information and the expression of opinion within Germany as well as the movement of intelligence of all kinds from and into Germany, and created a vast propaganda machine.</P>

<P>(f) The Nazi conspirators placed a considerable number of their dominated organizations on a progressively militarized footing with a view to the rapid transformation and use of such organizations whenever necessary as instruments of war.</P>

<P>(E) The acquiring of totalitarian control in Germany: economic; and the economic planning and mobilization for aggressive war.</P>

<P>Having gained political power, the conspirators organized Germany's economy to give effect to their political aims.</P>

<P>1 In order to eliminate the possibility of resistance in the economic sphere, they deprived labor of its rights of free industrial and political association as particularized in paragraph (D) 3 (c) (1) herein.</P>

<P>2 They used organizations of German business as instruments of economic mobilization for war.</P>

<P>3. They directed Germany's economy towards preparation and equipment of the military machine. To this end they directed finance, capital investment, and foreign trade.</P>

<P>4. The Nazi conspirators, and in particular the industrialists among them, embarked upon a huge re-armament program and set out to produce and develop huge quantities of materials of war and to create a powerful military potential.</P>

<P>5. With the object of carrying through the preparation for war the Nazi conspirators set up a series of administrative agencies and authorities. For example, in 1936 they established for this purpose the office of the Four Year Plan with the Defendant Goering as Plenipotentiary, vesting it with overriding control over Germany s economy. Furthermore, on 8/28/1939, immediately before launching their aggression against Poland, they appointed the Defendant Funk Plenipotentiary for Economics; and on 8/30/1939 they set up the Ministerial Council for the Defense of the Reich to act as a War Cabinet.</P>

<P>(F) Utilization of Nazi control for foreign aggression.</P>

<P>1. Status of the conspiracy by the middle of 1933 and projected plans.</P>

<P>By the middle of the year 1933 the Nazi conspirators, having acquired governmental control over Germany, were in a position to enter upon further and more detailed planning with particular relationship to foreign policy. Their plan was to re-arm and to reoccupy and fortify the Rhineland, in violation of the Treaty of Versailles and other treaties, in order to acquire military strength and political bargaining power to be used against other nations.</P>

<P>2. The Nazi conspirators decided that for their purpose the Treaty of Versailles must definitely be abrogated and specific plans were made by them and put into operation by 3/7/1936, all of which opened the way for the major aggressive steps to follow, as hereinafter set forth. In the execution of this phase of the conspiracy the Nazi conspirators did the following acts:</P>

<P>(a) They led Germany to enter upon a course of secret rearmament from 1933-3/1935, including the training of military personnel and the production of munitions of war, and the building of an air force.</P>

<P>(b) On 10/14/1933 they led Germany to leave the International Disarmament Conference and the League of Nations.</P>

<P>(c) On 3/10/1935 the Defendant Goering announced that Germany was building a military air force.</P>

<P>(d) On 3/16/1935 the Nazi conspirators promulgated a law for universal military service, in which they stated the peace time strength of the German Army would be fixed at 500000 men.</P>

<P>(e) On 5/21/1935 they falsely announced to the world, with intent to deceive and allay fears of aggressive intentions, that they would respect the territorial limitations of the Versailles Treaty and comply with the Locarno Pacts.</P>

<P>(f) On 3/7/1936 they reoccupied and fortified the Rhineland, in violation of the Treaty of Versailles and the Rhine Pact of Locarno of 10/16/1925, and falsely announced to the world that "we have no territorial demands to make in Europe."</P>

<P>3. Aggressive action against Austria and Czechoslovakia.</P>

<P>(a) The 1936-1938 phase of the plan: planning for the assault on Austria and Czechoslovakia.</P>

<P>The Nazi conspirators next entered upon the specific planning for the acquisition of Austria and Czechoslovakia, realizing it would be necessary, for military reasons, first to seize Austria before assaulting Czechoslovakia. On 5/21/1935 in a speech to the Reichstag, Hitler stated that:</P>

<P>"Germany neither intends, nor wishes to interfere in the internal affairs of Austria, to annex Austria or to conclude an Anschluss."</P>

<P>On 5/1/1936, within 2 months after the re-occupation of the Rhineland, Hitler stated:</P>

<P>"The lie goes forth again that Germany tomorrow or the day after will fall upon Austria or Czechoslovakia."</P>

<P>Thereafter, the Nazi conspirators caused a treaty to be entered into between Austria and Germany on 7/11/1936, Article I of which stated that:</P>

<P>"The German Government recognizes the full sovereignty of the Federated State of Austria in the spirit of the pronouncements of the German Fuehrer and Chancellor of 5/21/1935."</P>

<P>Meanwhile, plans for aggression in violation of that treaty were being made. By the autumn of 1937 all noteworthy opposition within the Reich had been crushed. Military preparation for the Austrian action was virtually concluded. An influential group of the Nazi conspirators met with Hitler on 11/1937, to review the situation. It was reaffirmed that Nazi Germany must have "Lebensraum" in Central Europe. It was recognized that such conquest would probably meet resistance which would have to be crushed by force and that their decision might lead to a general war, but this prospect was discounted as a risk worth taking. There emerged from this meeting three possible plans for the conquest of Austria and Czechoslovakia. Which of the three was to be used was to depend upon the developments in the political and military situation in Europe. It was contemplated during this meeting that the conquest of Austria and Czechoslovakia would, through compulsory emigration of 2 million persons from Czechoslovakia and 1 million persons from Austria, provide additional food to the Reich for 5 million to 6 million people, strengthen it militarily by providing shorter and better frontiers and make possible the constituting of new armies up to about twelve divisions. Thus, the aim of the plan against Austria and Czechoslovakia was conceived of not as an end in itself but as a preparatory measure toward the next aggressive steps in the Nazi conspiracy.</P>

<P>(b) The execution of the plan to invade Austria: 11/1937-3/1938.</P>

<P>Hitler, on 2/8/1938, called Chancellor Schuschnigg to a conference at Berchtesgaden. At the meeting of 2/12/1938, under threat of invasion, Schuschnigg yielded a promise of amnesty to imprisoned Nazis and appointment of Nazis to ministerial postsmeaning in Austria. He agreed to remain silent until Hitler's next speech in which Austria's independence was to be re-affirmed, but Hitler in that speech, instead of affirming Austrian independence, declared himself protector of all Germans. Meanwhile, subversive activities of Nazis in Austria increased. Schuschnigg, on 3/9/1938, announced a plebiscite for the following Sunday on the question of Austrian independence. On 11 March Hitler sent an ultimatum demanding that the plebiscite be called off or that Germany would invade Austria. Later the same day a second ultimatum threatened invasion unless Schuschnigg should resign in 3 hours Schuschnigg resigned. The Defendant Seyss-Inquart, Who was appointed Chancellor, immediately invited Hitler to send German troops into Austria to "preserve order." The invasion began on 3/12/1938. On 13 March Hitler by proclamation assumed Office as Chief of State of Austria and took command of its armed forces By a law of the same date Austria was annexed to Germany. (c) The execution of the plan to invade Czechoslovakia: 4/1938-3/1939.</P>

<P>(1) Simultaneously with their annexation of Austria, the Nazi conspirators gave false assurances to the Czechoslovak Government that they would not attack that country. But within a month they met to plan specific ways and means of attacking Czechoslovakia and to revise, in the light of the acquisition of Austria, the previous plans for aggression against Czechoslovakia.</P>

<P>(2) On 4/21/1938 the Nazi conspirators met and prepared to launch an attack on Czechoslovakia not later than 10/1/1938. They planned to create an "incident" to "justify" the attack. They decided to launch a military attack only after a period of diplomatic squabbling which, growing more serious, would lead to an excuse for war, or, in the alternative, to unleash a lightning attack as a result of an "incident" of their own creation. Consideration was given to assassinating the German Ambassador at Prague to create the requisite incident. From and after 4/21/1938, the Nazi conspirators caused to be prepared detailed and precise military plans designed to carry out such an attack at any opportune moment and calculated to overthrow all Czech resistance within 4 days, thus presenting the world with a fait accompli, and so forestalling outside resistance. Throughout the months of 5-9/1938, these plans were made more specific and detailed. and by 9/3/1938 it was decided that all troops were to be ready for action on 9/28/1938.</P>

<P>(3) Throughout this same period, the Nazi conspirators were agitating the minorities question in Czechoslovakia, and particularly in the Sudetenland, leading to a diplomatic crisis in 8-9/1938. After the Nazi conspirators threatened war, the United Kingdom and France concluded a pact with Germany and Italy at Munich on 9/29/1938, involving the cession of the Sudetenland by Czechoslovakia to Germany. Czechoslovakia was required to acquiesce. On 10/1/1938 German troops occupied the Sudetenland.</P>

<P>(4) On 3/15/1939, contrary to the provisions of the Munich Pact itself, the Nazi conspirators caused the completion of their plan by seizing and occupying the major part of Czechoslovakia. i.e. Bohemia and Moravia, not ceded to Germany by the Munich Pact.</P>

<P>4. Formulation of the plan to attack Poland: preparation and initiation of aggressive war: 3/1939-9/1939.</P>

<P>(a) With these aggressions successfully consummated, the conspirators had obtained much desired resources and bases and were ready to undertake further aggressions by means of war. Following the assurances to the world of peaceful intentions, an influential group of the conspirators met on 5/23/1939 to consider the further implementation of their plan. The situation was reviewed, and it was observed that "the past six years have been put to good use and all measures have been taken in correct sequence and in accordance with our aims, that the national-political unity of the Germans had been substantially achieved, and that further successes could not be achieved without war and bloodshed. It was decided nevertheless next to attack Poland at the first suitable opportunity. It was admitted that the questions concerning Danzig which they had agitated with Poland were not true questions, but rather that he question was one of aggressive expansion for food and "Lebensraum" It was recognized that Poland would fight if attacked and that a repetition of the Nazi success against Czechoslovakia without war could not be expected. Accordingly, it was determined that the problem was to isolate Poland and, if possible, prevent a simultaneous conflict with the Western Powers. Nevertheless, lt was agreed that England was an enemy to their aspirations, and that war with England and her ally France must eventually result, and therefore that in that war every attempt must be made to overwhelm England with a "Blitzkrieg", or lightning war. It was thereupon determined immediately to prepare detailed plans for an attack on Poland at the first suitable opportunity and thereafter for an attack on England and France, together with plans for the simultaneous occupation by armed force of air bases in the Netherlands and Belgium.</P>

<P>(b) Accordingly, after having denounced the German-Polish Pact of 1934 on false grounds, the Nazi conspirators proceeded to stir up the Danzig issue, to prepare frontier "incidents" to "justify" the attack, and to make demands for the cession of Polish territory. Upon refusal by Poland to yield, they caused German Armed Forces to invade Poland on 9/1/1939, thus precipitating war also with the United Kingdom and France.</P>

<P>5. Expansion of the war into a general war of aggression: planning and execution of attacks on Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Yugoslavia, and Greece: 1939-4/1941.</P>

<P>Thus the aggressive war prepared for by the Nazi conspirators through their attacks on Austria and Czechoslovakia was actively launched by their attack on Poland, in violation of the terms of the Briand-Kellogg Pact, 1928. After the total defeat of Poland, in order to facilitate the carrying out of their military operations against France and the United Kingdom, the Nazi conspirators made active preparations for an extension of the war in Europe. In accordance with these plans, they caused the German Armed Forces to invade Denmark and Norway on 4/9/1940; Belgium. the Netherlands, and Luxembourg on 5/10/1940; Yugoslavia and Greece on 4/6/1941. All these invasions had been specifically planned in advance.</P>

<P>6. German invasion on 6/22/1941 of the USSR territory in violation of the Non-Aggression Pact of 8/23/1939.</P>

<P>On 6/22/1941 the Nazi conspirators deceitfully denounced the Non-Aggression Pact between Germany and the USSR and with out any declaration of war invaded Soviet territory, thereby beginning a war of aggression against the USSR</P>

<P>From the first day of launching their attack on Soviet territory the Nazi conspirators, in accordance with their detailed plans, began to carry out the destruction of cities, towns, and villages, the demolition of factories, collective farms, electric stations, and railroads, the robbery and barbaric devastation of the natural cultural institutions of the peoples of the USSR, the devastation of museums, churches, historic monuments, the mass deportation of the Soviet citizens for slave labor to Germany, as well as the annihilation of old people, women, and children, especially Bielorussians and Ukrainians. The extermination of Jews was committed throughout the territory of the Soviet Union.</P>

<P>The above-mentioned criminal offenses were perpetrated by the German troops in accordance with the orders of the Nazi Government and the General Staff and High Command of the German Armed Forces.</P>

<P>7. Collaboration with Italy and Japan and aggressive war against the United States 11/1936-12/1941.</P>

<P>After the initiation of the Nazi wars of aggression the Nazi conspirators brought about a German-Italian-Japanese 10-year military-economic alliance signed at Berlin on 9/27/1940. This agreement, representing a strengthening of the bonds among those three nations established by the earlier but more limited pact of 11/25/1936, stated: "The Governments of Germany, Italy and Japan, considering it as a condition precedent of any lasting peace that all nations of the world be given each its own proper place, have decided to stand by and co-operate with one another in regard of their efforts in Greater East Asia and regions of Europe respectively wherein it is their prime purpose to establish and maintain a new order of things calculated to promote the mutual prosperity and welfare of the peoples concerned." The Nazi conspirators conceived that Japanese aggression would weaken and handicap those nations with which they were at war, and those with whom they contemplated war. Accordingly, the Nazi conspirators exhorted Japan to seek "a new order of things." Taking advantage of the wars of aggression then being waged by the Nazi conspirators, Japan commenced an attack on 12/7/1941 against the United States of America at Pearl Harbor and the Philippines, and against the British Commonwealth of Nations French Indo-China, and the Netherlands in the Southwest PacifiC Germany declared war against the United States on 12/11/1941.</P>

<P>G) War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity committed in the course of executing the conspiracy for which the conspirators are responsible.</P>

<P>1 Beginning with the initiation of the aggressive war on 9/1/1939, and throughout its extension into wars involving almost the entire world, the Nazi conspirators carried out their Common Plan or Conspiracy to wage war in ruthless and complete disregard and violation of the laws and customs of war. In the course of executing the Common Plan or Conspiracy, there were committed the War Crimes detailed hereinafter in Count Three of this Indictment.</P>

<P>2 Beginning with the initiation of their plan to seize and retain total control of the German State, and thereafter throughout their utilization of that control for foreign aggression, the Nazi conspirators carried out their Common Plan or Conspiracy in ruthless and complete disregard and violation of the laws of humanity. In the course of executing the Common Plan or Conspiracy there were committed the Crimes against Humanity detailed hereinafter in Count Four of this Indictment.</P>

<P>3. By reason of all the foregoing, the defendants with divers other persons are guilty of a Common Plan or Conspiracy for the accomplishment of Crimes against Peace; of a conspiracy to commit Crimes against Humanity in the course of preparation for war and in the course of prosecution of war, and of a conspiracy to commit War Crimes not only against the armed forces of their enemies but also against non-belligerent civilian populations.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal understands that the Defendant Ernst Kaltenbrunner is temporarily ill. The Trial will continue in his absence. I call upon the Chief Prosecutor for the Provisional Government of the French Republic.</P>

<P>M. PIERRE MOUNIER (Assistant Prosecutor for the French Republic): COUNT THREEWAR CRIMES. Charter, Article 6, especially 6 (b).</P>

<P>VIII. Statement of the Offense.</P>

<P>All the defendants committed War Crimes between 9/1/1939-5/8/1945, in Germany and in all those countries and territories occupied by the German Armed Forces since 9/1/1939, and in Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Italy, and on the the defendants, acting in concert with others, formulated and executed a Common Plan or Conspiracy to commit War Crimes as defined in Article 6 (b) of the Charter. This plan involved, among other things the practice of "total war" including methods of combat and of military occupation in direct conflict with the laws and customs of war, and the perpetration of crimes committed on the field of battle during encounters with enemy armies, against prisoners of war, and in occupied territories against the civilian population of such territories.</P>

<P>The said War Crimes were committed by the defendants and by other persons for whose acts the defendants are responsible (under Article 6 of the Charter) as such other persons when committing the said War Crimes performed their acts in execution of a Common Plan and Conspiracy to commit the said War Crimes, in the formulation and execution of which plan and conspiracy all the defendants participated as leaders, organizers, instigators, and accomplices.</P>

<P>These methods and crimes constituted violations of international conventions, of internal penal laws, and of the general principles of criminal law as derived from the criminal law of all civilized nations, and were involved in and part of a systematic course of conduct.</P>

<P>(A) Murder and ill-treatment of civilian populations of or in occupied territory and on the High Seas.</P>

<P>Throughout the period of their occupation of territories overrun by their armed forces, the defendants, for the purpose of systematically terrorizing the inhabitants, ill-treated civilians, imprisoned them without legal process, tortured, and murdered them.</P>

<P>The murders and ill-treatment were carried out by divers means, such as shooting, hanging, gassing, starvation, gross overcrowding, systematic undernutrition, systematic imposition of labor tasks beyond the strength of those ordered to carry them out, inadequate provision of surgical and medical services, kickings, beatings, brutality and torture of all kinds, including the use of hot irons and pulling out of fingernails and the performance of experiments by means of operations and otherwise on living human subjects. In some occupied territories the defendants interfered with religious services, persecuted members of the clergy and monastic orders, and expropriated church property. They conducted deliberate and systematic genocide; viz., the extermination of racial and national groups, against the civilian population of certain occupied territories in order to destroy particular races and classes of people, and national, racial, or religious groups, particularly Jews, Poles, and Gypsies.</P>

<P>Civilians were systematically subjected to tortures of all kinds with the object of obtaining information.</P>

<P>Civilians of occupied countries were subjected systematically to "protective arrests", that is to say they were arrested and imprisoned without any trial and any of the ordinary protections of the law, and they were imprisoned under the most unhealthy and inhumane conditions.</P>

<P>In the concentration camps were many prisoners who were classified "Nacht und Nebel". These were entirely cut off from the world and were allowed neither to receive nor to send letters. The disappeared without trace and no announcement of their fate was ever made by the German authorities.</P>

<P>Such crimes and ill-treatment are contrary to international conventions, in particular to Article 46 of the Hague Regulations, 1907 the laws and customs of war, the general principles of criminal law as derived from the criminal laws of all civilized nations, the internal penal laws of the countries in which such crimes were committed, and to Article 6 (b) of the Charter.</P>

<P>The following particulars and all the particulars appearing later in this Count are set out herein by way of example only, are not exclusive of other particular cases, and are stated without prejudice to the right of the Prosecution to adduce evidence of other cases of murder and ill-treatment of civilians.</P>

<P>1. In France, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Norway, Luxembourg Italy, and the Channel Islands, (hereinafter called the "Western Countries"), and in that part of Germany which lies west of a line drawn due north and south through the center of Berlin (hereinafter called "Western Germany").</P>

<P>Such murder and ill-treatment took place in concentration camps and similar establishments set up by the defendants, and particularly in the concentration camps set up at Belsen, Buchenwald Dachau, Breendonck, Grini, Natzweiler, Ravensbrueck, Vught, and Amersfoort, and in numerous cities, towns, and villages, including Oradour sur Glane, Trondheim, and Oslo.</P>

<P>Crimes committed in France or against French citizens took the following forms:</P>

<P>Arbitrary arrests were carried out under political or racial pretexts; they were either individual or collective; notably in Paris (round-up of the 18th Arrondissement by the Field Gendarmerie, round-up of the Jewish population of the 11th Arrondissement in 8/1941, round-up in 7/1942); at Clermont-Ferrand (round-up of professors and students of the University of Strasbourg, which d been evacuated to Clermont-Ferrand, on 11/25/1943); at ons, at Marseilles (round-up of 40000 persons in 1/1943); at Grenoble (round-up of 12/24/1943); at Cluny (round-up on 12/24/1943); at Figeac (round-up in 5/1944); at Saint Pol de Leon (round-up in 7/1944); at Locmine (round-up on 7/3/1944); at Eysieux (round-up in 5/1944); and at Meaux-Moussey (round-up in 9/1944). These arrests were followed by brutal treatment and tortures carried out by the most diverse methods, such as immersion in icy water, asphyxiation, torture of the limbs, and the use of instruments of torture, such as the iron helmet and electric current, and practiced in all the prisons of France, notably in Paris, Lyons, Marseilles, Rennes, Metz, Clermont-Ferrand, Toulouse, Nice, Grenoble, Annecy, Arras, Bethune, Lille, Loos, Valenciennes, Nancy, Troyes, and Caen, and in the torture chambers fitted up at the Gestapo centers. In the concentration camps, the health regime and the labor regime were such that the rate of mortality (alleged to be from natural causes) attained enormous proportions, for instance:</P>

<P>1. Out of a convoy of 250 French women deported from Compiegne to Auschwitz in 1/1943, 180 had died of exhaustion at the end of 4 months.</P>

<P>2. 143 Frenchmen died of exhaustion between 3/23/-5/6/1943 in Block 8 at Dachau.</P>

<P>3. 1797 Frenchmen died of exhaustion between 11/21/1943 and 3/15/1945 in the block at Dora.</P>

<P>4. 465 Frenchmen died of general debility in 11/1944 at Dora.</P>

<P>5. 22761 deportees died of exhaustion at Buchenwald between 1/1/1943-4/15/1945.</P>

<P>6. 11560 detainees died of exhaustion at Dachau Camp (most of them in Block 30 reserved for the sick and the infirm) between 1/1-4/15/1945.</P>

<P>7. 780 priests died of exhaustion at Mauthausen.</P>

<P>8. Out of 2200 Frenchmen registered at Flossenburg Camp, 1600 died from supposedly natural causes.</P>

<P>Methods used for the work of extermination in concentration camps were:</P>

<P>Bad treatment pseudo-scientific experiments (sterilization of women at Auschwitz and at Ravensbrueck, study of the evolution of cancer of the womb at Auschwitz, of typhus at Buchenwald, anatomical research at Natzweiler, heart injections at Buchenwald, bone grafting and muscular excisions at Ravensbrueck, et cetera) and by gas chambers, gas wagons, and crematory ovens. Of 228000 French political and racial deportees in concentration camps, only 28000 survived.</P>

<P>In France also systematic extermination was practised, notably at Asq on 4/1/1944, at Colpo on 7/22/1944, at Buzet sur Tarn on 7/6/1944 and on 8/17/1944, at Pluvignier on 7/8/1944, at Rennes on 6/8/1944, at Grenoble on 7/8/1944, at Saint Flour on 6/10/1944, at Ruisnes on 6/10/1944, at Nimes at Tulle, and at Nice, where, in 7/1944, the victims of torture were exposed to the population, and at Oradour sur Glane where the entire village population was shot or burned alive in the church.</P>

<P>The many charnel pits give proof of anonymous massacres. Most notable of these are the charnel pits of Paris (Cascade du Bois de Boulogne), Lyons, Saint Genis-Laval, Besancon, Petit Saint Bernard, Aulnat, Caen, Port Louis, Charleval, Fontainebleau, Bouconne, Gabaudet, Lhermitage Lorges, Morlaas, Bordelongue, Signe.</P>

<P>In the course of a premeditated campaign of terrorism, initiated in Denmark by the Germans in the latter part of 1943, 600 Danish subjects were murdered and, in addition, throughout the German occupation of Denmark large numbers of Danish subjects were subjected to torture and ill-treatment of all sorts. In addition, approximately five hundred Danish subjects were murdered, by torture and otherwise, in German prisons and concentration camps.</P>

<P>In Belgium, between 1940-1944, torture by various means but identical in each place, was carried out at Brussels, Liege. Mons, Ghent, Namur, Antwerp, Tournai, Arlon, Charleroi, and Dinant.</P>

<P>At Vught, in Holland, when the camp was evacuated, about four hundred persons were shot.</P>

<P>In Luxembourg, during the German occupation, 500 persons were murdered and, in addition, another 521 were illegally executed, by order of such special tribunals as the so-called "Sondergericht". Many more persons in Luxembourg were subjected to torture and ill-treatment by the Gestapo. At least 4000 Luxembourg nationals were imprisoned during the period of German occupation, and of these at least 400 were murdered.</P>

<P>Between 3/1944-4/1945, in Italy, at least 7500 men. women, and children, ranging in years from infancy to extreme old age were murdered by the German soldiery at Civitella, in the Ardeatine Caves in Rome, and at other places.</P>

<P>(B) Deportation, for slave labor and for other purposes, of the civilian populations of and in occupied territories.</P>

<P>During the whole period of the occupation by Germany of the Western and the Eastern Countries, it was the policy of German Government and of the German High Command to deport able-bodied citizens from such occupied countries to Germany and to other occupied countries to force them to work on fortifications in factories, and in other tasks connected with the German war effort.</P>

<P>In pursuance of such policy there were mass deportations from all the Western and Eastern Countries for such purposes during the whole period of the occupation.</P>

<P>These deportations were contrary to the international conventions, in particular to Article 46 of the Hague Regulations, 1907, the laws and customs of war, the general principles of criminal law as derived from the criminal laws of all civilized nations, the internal penal laws of the countries in which such crimes were committed, and to Article 6 (b) of the Charter.</P>

<P>Particulars of deportations, by way of example only and without prejudice to the production of evidence of other cases, are as follows:</P>

<P>1. From the Western Countries:</P>

<P>From France the following "deportations" of persons for political and racial reasons took placeeach of which consisted of from 1500-3500 deportees:</P>

<P>1940, 3 transports; 1941, 14 transports; 1942, 104 transports; 1943, 257 transports; 1944, 326 transports.</P>

<P>These deportees were subjected to the most barbarous conditions of overcrowding; they were provided with wholly insufficient clothing and were given little or no food for several days.</P>

<P>The conditions of transport were such that many deportees died in the course of the voyage, for example:</P>

<P>In one of the wagons of the train which left Compiegne for Buchenwald on the 9/17/1943, 80 men died out of 130.</P>

<P>On 6/4/1944, 484 bodies were taken out of a train at Sarrebourg.</P>

<P>In a train which left Compiegne on 7/2/1944 for Dachau, more than 600 dead were found on arrival, i.e. one-third of the total number.</P>

<P>In a train which left Compiegne on 1/16/1944 for Buchenwald, more than 100 persons were confined in each wagon, the dead and the wounded being heaped in the last wagon during the voyage.</P>

<P>In 4/1945, of 12000 internees evacuated from Buchenwald 4000 only were still alive when the marching column arrived near Regensburg.</P>

<P>During the German occupation of Denmark, 5200 Danish subjects were deported to Germany and there imprisoned in concentration camps and other places.</P>

<P>In 1942 and thereafter, 6000 nationals of Luxembourg were deported from their country under deplorable conditions and many of them perished.</P>

<P>From Belgium, between 1940-1944, at least 190000 civilians were deported to Germany and used as slave labor. Such deportees were subjected to ill-treatment and many of them were compelled to work in armament factories.</P>

<P>From Holland, between 1940-1944, nearly half a million civilians were deported to Germany and to other occupied countries.</P>

<P>(C) Murder and ill-treatment of prisoners of war, and of other members of the armed forces of the countries with whom Germany was at war, and of persons on the High Seas.</P>

<P>The defendants ill-treated and murdered prisoners of war by denying them suitable food, shelter, clothing, and medical care and other attention; by forcing them to labor in inhumane conditions: by humiliating them, torturing them, and by killing them. The German Government and the German High Command imprisoned prisoners of war in various concentration camps, where they were killed or subjected to inhuman treatment by the various methods set forth in Paragraph VIII (A).</P>

<P>Members of the armed forces of the countries with whom Germany was at war were frequently murdered while in the act of surrendering.</P>

<P>These murders and ill-treatment were contrary to international conventions, particularly Articles 4-7 of the Hague Regulations, 1907, and to Articles 2-4, and 6 of the Prisoners of War Convention, Geneva, 1929, the laws and customs of war, the general principles of criminal law as derived from the criminal laws of all civilized nations, the internal penal laws of the countrieS in which such crimes were committed, and to Article 6 (b) of the Charter.</P>

<P>Particulars by way of example and without prejudice to the production of evidence of other cases, are as follows:</P>

<P>In the Western Countries:</P>

<P>French officers who escaped from Oflag X C were handed over to the Gestapo and disappeared; others were murdered by their guards; others sent to concentration camps and exterminated. Among others, the men of Stalag VI C were sent to Buchenwald.</P>

<P>Frequently prisoners captured on the Western Front were obliged to march to the camps until they completely collapsed. Some of them walked more than 600 kilometers with hardly any food; they marched on for 48 hours running, without being fed; among them a certain number died of exhaustion or of hunger; stragglers were systematically murdered.</P>

<P>The same crimes were committed in 1943-1945, when occupants of the camps were withdrawn before the Allied advance particularly during the withdrawal of the prisoners from Sagan on 2/8/1945.</P>

<P>Bodily punishments were inflicted upon non-commissioned officers and cadets who refused to work. On 12/24/1943, three French non-commissioned officers were murdered for that motive in Stalag IV A. Much ill-treatment was inflicted without motive on other ranks; stabbing with bayonets, striking with riflebutts, and whipping; in Stalag XX B the sick themselves were beaten many times by sentries; in Stalag III B and Stalag III C worn-out prisoners were murdered or grievously wounded. In military jails, in Graudenz for instance, in reprisal camps, as in Rava-Ruska, the food was so insufficient that the men lost more than 15 kilograms in a few weeks. In 5/1942, one loaf of bread only was distributed in Rava-Ruska to each group of 35 men.</P>

<P>Orders were given to transfer French officers in chains to the camp of Mauthausen after they had tried to escape. At their arrival in camp they were murdered, either by shooting or by gas, and their bodies destroyed in the crematorium.</P>

<P>American prisoners, officers and men, were murdered in Normandy during the summer of 1944 and in the Ardennes in 12/1944. American prisoners were starved, beaten, and mutilated in various ways in numerous Stalags in Germany or in the occupied countries, particularly in 1943-1945.</P>

<P>(D) Killing of hostages.</P>

<P>Throughout the territories occupied by the German Armed Forces in the course of waging their aggressive wars, the defendants adOpted and put into effect on a wide scale the practice of taking and killing hostages from the civilian population. These acts were contrary to international conventions, particularly Article 50 of the Hague Regulations 1907, the laws and customs of war, the general principles of criminal law as derived from the criminal laws of all civilized nations the internal penal laws of the countries in which such crimes were committed, and to Article 6 (b) of the Charter. Particulars, by way of example and without prejudice to the production of evidence of other cases, are as follows:</P>

<P>In the Western Countries:</P>

<P>In France hostages were executed either individually or collectively; these executions took place in all the big cities of France, among others in Paris, Bordeaux, and Nantes, as well as at Chateaubriant.</P>

<P>In Holland many hundreds of hostages were shot at the following among other places: Rotterdam, Apeldoorn, Amsterdam, Benshop and Haarlem.</P>

<P>In Belgium many hundreds of hostages were shot during the period 1940-1944.</P>

<P>M. CHARLES GERTHOFFER (Assistant Prosecutor for the French Republic) Continuing the reading of the Indictment]:</P>

<P>(E) Plunder of public and private property.</P>

<P>The defendants ruthlessly exploited the people and the material resources of the countries they occupied, in order to strengthen the Nazi war machine, to depopulate and impoverish the rest of Europe to enrich themselves and their adherents, and to promote German economic supremacy over Europe.</P>

<P>The defendants engaged in the following acts and practices among others:</P>

<P>1. They degraded the standard of life of the people of occupied countries and caused starvation by stripping occupied countries of foodstuffs for removal to Germany.</P>

<P>2. They seized raw materials and industrial machinery in all of the occupied countries, removed them to Germany and used them in the interest of the German war effort and the German economy.</P>

<P>3. In all the occupied countries, in varying degrees, they confiscated businesses, plants, and other property.</P>

<P>4. In an attempt to give color of legality to illegal acquisitions of property, they forced owners of property to go through the forms of "voluntary" and "legal" transfers.</P>

<P>5. They established comprehensive controls over the economies of all of the occupied countries and directed their resources, their production, and their labor in the interests of the German war economy, depriving the local populations of the products of essential industries.</P>

<P>6. By a variety of financial mechanisms, they despoiled all of the occupied countries of essential commodities and accumulated wealth, debased the local currency systems and disrupted the local economies. They financed extensive purchases in occupied countries through clearing arrangements by which they exacted loans from the occupied countries. They imposed occupation levies, exacted financial contributions, and issued occupation currency, far in excess of occupation costs. They used these excess funds to finance the purchase of business properties and supplies in the occupied countries.</P>

<P>7. They abrogated the rights of the local populations in the occupied portions of the USSR and in Poland and in other countries to develop or manage agricultural and industrial properties and reserved this area for exclusive settlement, development, and ownership by Germans and their so-called racial brethren.</P>

<P>8. In further development of their plan of criminal exploitation, they destroyed industrial cities, cultural monuments, scientific institutions, and property of all types in the occupied territories to eliminate the possibility of competition with Germany.</P>

<P>9 From their program of terror, slavery, spoliation, and organized outrage, the Nazi conspirators created an instrument for the personal profit and aggrandizement of themselves and their adherents. They secured for themselves and their adherents:</P>

<P>(a) positions in administration of business involving power, influence, and lucrative prerequisites;</P>

<P>(b) The use of cheap forced labor;</P>

<P>(c) The acquisition on advantageous terms of foreign properties, raw materials, and business interests;</P>

<P>(d) The basis for the industrial supremacy of Germany.</P>

<P>These acts were contrary to international conventions, particularly Articles 46-56 inclusive of the Hague Regulations, 1907, the laws and customs of war, the general principles of criminal law as derived from the criminal laws of all civilized nations, the internal penal laws of the countries in which. such crimes were committed, and to Article 6 (b) of the Charter.</P>

<P>Particulars, by way of example and without prejudice to the production of evidence of other cases, are as follows:</P>

<P>1. Western Countries:</P>

<P>There was plundered from the Western Countries from 1940-1944, works of art, artistic objects, pictures, plastics, furniture, textiles, antique pieces, and similar articles of enormous value to the number of 21903.</P>

<P>In France statistics show the following:</P>

<P>Removal of raw materials:</P>

<P>Coal, 63 million, electric energy, 20976 Mkwh; petrol and fuel, 1.943 million tons; iron ore, 74.848 million tons; siderurgical products, 3.822 million tons; bauxite, 1.211 million tons; cement, 5.984 million tons; lime, 1.888 million tons; quarry products 25.87 million tons; and various other products to a total value of F79.961 billion.</P>

<P>Removal of industrial equipment: totalF9.759 billion, of which F2.626 billion of machine tools.</P>

<P>Removal of agricultural produce: totalF126.655 billion; i.e. for the principal products:</P>

<P>Wheat, 2.947 million tons; oats, 2.354 million tons; milk, 790000 hectolitres (concentrated and in powder, 460000 hectolitres); butter, 76000 tons; cheese, 49000 tons; potatoes, 725975 tons; various vegetables, 575000 tons; wine, 7.647 million hectolitres; champagne, 87 million bottles; beer 3.82 million hectolitres; various kinds of alcohol, 1.83 million hectolitres.</P>

<P>Removal of manufactured products to a total of F184.64 billion.</P>

<P>Plundering: F257.02 billion from private enterprise F55 billion from the State.</P>

<P>Financial exploitation: From 6/1940-9/1944 the French Treasury was compelled to pay to Germany F631.866 billion.</P>

<P>Looting and destruction of works of art: The museums of Nantes, Nancy, Old-Marseilles were looted.</P>

<P>Private collections of great value were stolen. In this wa Raphaels, Vermeers, Van Dycks, and works of Rubens, Holbein Rembrandt, Watteau, Boucher disappeared. Germany compelled France to deliver up "The Mystic Lamb" by Van Eyck, which Belgium had entrusted to her.</P>

<P>In Norway and other occupied countries decrees were made b which the property of many civilians, societies, et cetera, was confiscated. An immense amount of property of every kind was plundered from France, Belgium, Norway, Holland, and Luxembourg.</P>

<P>As a result of the economic plundering of Belgium between 1940-1944 the damage suffered amounted to 175 billions of Belgian francs.</P>

<P>(F) The exaction of collective penalties.</P>

<P>The Germans pursued a systematic policy of inflicting, in all the occupied countries, collective penalties, pecuniary and otherwise upon the population for acts of individuals for which it could not be regarded as collectively responsible; this was done at man places, including Oslo, Stavanger, Trondheim, and Rogaland.</P>

<P>Similar instances occurred in France, among others in Dijon Nantes, and as regards the Jewish population in the occupied territories. The total amount of fines imposed on French communities adds up to F1.157 billion made up as follows: A fine on the Jewish population, F1 billion; various fines, F157.179 million.</P>

<P>These acts violated Article 50, Hague Regulations, 1907, the laws and customs of war, the general principles of criminal law as derived from the criminal laws of all civilized nations, the internal penal laws of the countries in which such crimes were committed and Article 6 (b) of the Charter.</P>

<P>(G) Wanton destruction of cities, towns, and villages, and devastation not justified by military necessity.</P>

<P>The defendants wantonly destroyed cities, towns, and villages and committed other acts of devastation without military justification or necessity. These acts violated Articles 46 and 50 of the Hague Regulations, 1907, the laws and customs of war, the general principles of criminal law as derived from the criminal laws of all civilized nations, the internal penal laws of the countries in which such crimes were committed, and Article 6 (b) of the Charter.</P>

<P>Particulars by way of example only and without prejudice to the production of evidence of other cases, are as follows:</P>

<P>1. Western Countries:</P>

<P>In 3/1941 part of Lofoten in Norway was destroyed. In 4/1942 the town of Telerag in Norway was destroyed.</P>

<P>Entire villages were destroyed in France, among others, Oradour sur Glane, Saint Nizier in Gascogne, La Mure, Vassieu, La Chappelle en Vercors. The town of Saint Die was burnt down and destroyed. The Old Port District of Marseilles was dynamited in the beginning of 1943 and resorts along the Atlantic and the Mediterranean coasts, particularly the town of Sanary, were demolished.</P>

<P>In Holland there was most widespread and extensive destruction, not justified by military necessity, including the destruction of harbors, locks, dykes, and bridges; immense devastation was also caused by inundations which equally were not justified by military necessity.</P>

<P>(H) Conscription of civilian labor.</P>

<P>Throughout the occupied territories the defendants conscripted and forced the inhabitants to labor and requisitioned their services for purposes other than meeting the needs of the armies of occupation and to an extent far out of proportion to the resources of the countries involved. All the civilians so conscripted were forced to work for the German war effort. Civilians were required to register and many of those who registered were forced to join the Todt Organization and the Speer Legion, both of which were semi-military organizations involving some military training. These acts violated Articles 46-52 of the Hague Regulations, 1907, the laws and customs of war, the general principles of criminal law as derived from the criminal laws of all civilized nations, the internal penal laws of the countries in which such crimes were committed, and Article 6 (b) of the Charter.</P>

<P>Particulars, by way of example only and without prejudice to the production of evidence of other cases, are as follows:</P>

<P>1. Western Countries:</P>

<P>In France from 1942-1944, 963813 persons were compelled to work in Germany and 737000 to work in France for the German Army.</P>

<P>In Luxembourg in 1944 alone, 2500 men and 500 girls were conscripted for forced labor.</P>

<P>(I) Forcing civilians of occupied territories to swear allegiance to a hostile power.</P>

<P>Civilians who joined the Speer Legion, as set forth in Paragraph (H) were required, under threat of depriving them of food money, and identity papers, to swear a solemn oath acknowledging unconditional obedience to Adolf Hitler, the Fuehrer of Germany, which was to them a hostile power.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will now adjourn until 2 o'clock.</P>

<P>[The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.].</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Will the Chief Prosecutor for the French Republic continue the reading of the Indictment.</P>

<P>M. MOUNIER: In Lorraine, civil servants were obliged, in order to retain their positions, to sign a declaration by which they acknowledged the "return of their country to the Reich", pledged themselves to obey without reservation the orders of their chiefs and put themselves "at the active service of the Fuehrer and of National Socialist greater Germany.</P>

<P>A similar pledge was imposed on Alsatian civil servants, by threat of deportation or internment.</P>

<P>These acts violated Article 45 of the Hague Regulations, 1907, the laws and customs of war, the general principles of international law, and Article 6 (b) of the Charter.</P>

<P>(J) Germanization of occupied territories.</P>

<P>In certain occupied territories purportedly annexed to Germany the defendants methodically and pursuant to plan endeavoured to assimilate those territories politically, culturally, socially, and economically into the German Reich. They endeavoured to obliterate the former national character of these territories. In pursuance of these plans, the defendants forcibly deported inhabitants who were predominantly non-German and replaced them by thousands of German colonists.</P>

<P>Their plan included economic domination, physical conquest, installation of puppet governments, purported de jure annexation and enforced conscription into the German Armed Forces.</P>

<P>This was carried out in most of the occupied countries especially in Norway, France (particularly in the Departments of Upper Rhine, Lower Rhine, Moselle, Ardennes, Aisne, Nord, Meurthe and Moselle), in Luxembourg, the Soviet Union, Denmark, Belgium, and Holland.</P>

<P>In France in the Departments of Aisne, Nord, Meurthe and Moselle, and especially in that of the Ardennes, rural properties were confiscated by a German state organization which tried to work them under German management.</P>

<P>The landowners of these holdings were dispossessed and turned into agricultural laborers. In the Departments of Upper Rhine, Lower Rhine, and Moselle the methods of Germanization were those of annexation followed by conscription.</P>

<P>From the month of 8/1940 officials who refused to take the oath of allegiance to the Reich were expelled. On September 21st the expulsion and deportation of population began, and on 11/22/1940 more than 70,000 Lorrainers or Alsatians were driven into the south zone of France. From 7/31/1941 onwards more than 100000 persons were deported into the eastern regions of the Reich or to Poland. All the property of the deportees or expelled persons was confiscated. At the same time, 80000 Germans coming from the Saar or from Westphalia were installed in Lorraine and 2000 farms belonging to French people were transferred to Germans.</P>

<P>2. From 1/2/1942 all the young people of the Departments of Upper Rhine and Lower Rhine, aged from 10-18 years were incorporated in the Hitler Youth. The same measures were take,,n in the Moselle from 8/4/1942. From 1940 all the French schools were closed, their staffs expelled, and the German school system was introduced in the three departments.</P>

<P>3. On the 9/28/1940 an order applicable to the Department of the Moselle ordained the Germanization of all the surnames and Christian names which were French in form. The same measure was taken on the 1/15/1943 in the Departments of Upper Rhine and Lower Rhine.</P>

<P>4. Two orders of the 8/23-24/1942 imposed by force German nationality on French citizens.</P>

<P>5. On the 5/8/1941 for Upper Rhine and Lower Rhine and on the 4/23/1941 for the Moselle, orders were promulgated enforcing compulsory labor service on all French citizens of either sex aged from 17-25 years. From the 1/1/1942 for young men, and from the 1/26/1942 for young women national labor service was effectively organized in the Moselle This measure came into force on the 8/27/1942 in Upper Rhine and Lower Rhine, but for young men only. The classes of 1940-1942 were called up.</P>

<P>6. These contingents were drafted into the Wehrmacht on the expiration of their time in the labor service.</P>

<P>On the 8/19/1942 an order instituted compulsory military service in the Moselle, and on the 8/25/1942 the contingents of 1940-1944 were called up in the three Departments.</P>

<P>Conscription was enforced by the German authorities in conformity with the provisions of German legislation. The first induction board took place on the 9/3/1942. Later, in the Upper Rhine and Lower Rhine new levies were effected everywhere of the contingents from 1928-1939 inclusive. The French men who refused to obey these laws were considered as deserters and their families were deported, while their property was confiscated.</P>

<P>These acts violated Articles 43, 46, 55-56 of the Hague Regulations, 1907, the laws and customs of war, the general principles of criminal law as derived from the criminal laws of all civilized nations, the internal penal laws of the countries in which such crimes were committed, and Article 6 (b) of the Charter.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I will now call upon the Chief Prosecutor for the Soviet Union.</P>

<P>LIEUTENANT COLONEL J. A. OZOL (Assistant Prosecutor for the USSR): COUNT THREEWAR CRIMES.</P>

<P>All the defendants committed War Crimes between 9/1/1939 and 5/8/1945 in Germany and in all those countries and territories occupied by the German Armed Forces since 9/1/1939, and in Austria, Czechoslovakia, Italy, and on the High Seas.</P>

<P>All the defendants, acting in concert with others, formulated and executed a Common Plan or Conspiracy to commit War Crimes as defined in Article 6 (b) of the Charter. This plan involved, among other things, the practice of "total war" including methods of combat and of military occupation in direct conflict with the laws and customs of war, and the commission of crimes perpetrated on the field of battle during encounters with enemy armies, and against prisoners of war, and in occupied territories against the civilian population of such territories.</P>

<P>The said War Crimes were committed by the defendants and by other persons for whose acts the defendants are responsible (Under Article 6 of the Charter) as such other persons when committing the said War Crimes performed their acts in execution of the common plan and conspiracy to commit the said War Crimes, in the formulation and execution of which plan and conspiracy all the defendants participated as leaders, organizers, instigators, and accomplices.</P>

<P>These methods and crimes constituted violations of international conventions, of internal penal laws, and of the general principles of criminal law as derived from the criminal law of all civilized nations, and were involved in and part of a systematic course of conduct.</P>

<P>(A) Murder and ill-treatment of civilian populations of or in occupied territory and on the High Seas.</P>

<P>Throughout the period of their occupation of territories overrun by their armed forces the defendants, for the purpose of systematically terrorizing the inhabitants, murdered and tortured civilians, and ill-treated them, and imprisoned them without legal process.</P>

<P>The murders and ill-treatment were carried out by divers means, including shooting, hanging, gassing, starvation, gross overcrowding, systematic undernutrition, systematic imposition of labor beyond the strength of those ordered to carry them out, inadequate provision of surgical and medical services, kickings, beatings, brutality, and torture of all kinds, including the use of hot irons and pulling out of fingernails and the performance of experiments by means of operations and otherwise on living human subjects. In some occupied territories the defendants interfered with religious services, persecuted members of the clergy and monastic orders, and expropriated church property. They conducted deliberate and systematic genocide, viz. the extermination of racial and national groups, against the civilian populations of certain occupied territories in order to destroy particular races and classes of people, and national, racial, or religious groups, particularly Jews, Poles, and Gypsies and others.</P>

<P>Civilians were systematically subjected to tortures of all kinds, with the object of obtaining information.</P>

<P>Civilians of occupied countries were subjected systematically to "protective arrests" whereby they were arrested and imprisoned without any trial and any of the ordinary protections of the law, and they were imprisoned under the most unhealthy and inhumane conditions.</P>

<P>In the concentration camps were many prisoners who were classified "Nacht und Nebel". These were entirely cut off from the world and were allowed neither to receive nor to send letters. They disappeared without trace and no announcement of their fate was ever made by the German authorities.</P>

<P>Such murders and ill-treatment were contrary to international conventions, in particular to Article 46 of the Hague Regulations, 1907, the laws and customs of war, the general principles of criminal law as derived from the criminal laws of all civilized nations, the internal penal laws of the countries in which such crimes were committed, and to Article 6 (b) of the Charter.</P>

<P>The following particulars and all the particulars appearing late in this Count are set out herein by way of example only, are not exclusive of other particular cases, and are stated without prejudice to the right of the Prosecution to adduce evidence of other cases of murder and ill-treatment of civilians.</P>

<P>[2.] In the USSR, i.e. in the Bielorussian, Ukrainian. Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Karelo-Finnish, and Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republics, in 19 regions of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic, and in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece, and the Balkans (hereinafter called the "Eastern Countries").</P>

<P>From the 9/1/1939, when the German Armed Forces invaded Poland, and from the 6/22/1941, when they invaded the USSR, the German Government and the German High Command adopted a systematic policy of murder and ill-treatment of the civilian populations of and in the Eastern Countries as they were successively occupied by the German Armed Forces. These murders and ill-treatments were carried on continuously until the German Armed Forces were driven out of the said countries.</P>

<P>Such murders and ill-treatments included:</P>

<P>a) Murders and ill-treatments at concentration camps and similar establishments set up by the Germans in the Eastern Countries and in Eastern Germany including those set up at Maidanek and Auschwitz.</P>

<P>The said murders and ill-treatments were carried out by divers means including all those set out above, as follows:</P>

<P>About 1 1/2 million persons were exterminated in Maidanek and about 4 million persons were exterminated in Auschwitz, among whom were citizens of Poland, the USSR, the United States of America, Great Britain, Czechoslovakia, France, and other countries.</P>

<P>In the Lwow region and in the city of Lwow the Germans exterminated about 700000 Soviet people, including 70 persons in the field of the arts, science, and technology, and also citizens of the USA, Great Britain, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Holland, brought to this region from other concentration camps.</P>

<P>In the Jewish ghetto from 9/7/1941-7/6/1943 over 133000 persons were tortured and shot.</P>

<P>Mass shooting of the population occurred in the suburbs of the city and in the Livenitz forest.</P>

<P>In the Ganov camp 200000 citizens were exterminated. The most refined methods of cruelty were employed in this extermination, such as disembowelling and the freezing of human beings in tubs of water. Mass shootings took place to the accompaniment of the music of an orchestra recruited from the persons interned.</P>

<P>Beginning with 6/1943 the Germans carried out measures to hide the evidence of their crimes. They exhumed and burned corpses, and they crushed the bones with machines and used them for fertilizer.</P>

<P>At the beginning of 1944, in the Ozarichi region of the Bielorussian SSR, before liberation by the Red Army, the Germans established three concentration camps without shelters, to which they committed tens of thousands of persons from the neighbouring territories. They intentionally brought many people to these camps from typhus hospitals, for the purpose of infecting the other persons interned and for spreading the disease in territories from which the Germans were driven by the Red Army. In these camps there were many murders and crimes.</P>

<P>In the Estonian SSR they shot tens of thousands of persons and in one day alone, 9/19/1944, in Camp Kloga, the Germans shot 2000 peaceful citizens. They burned the bodies on bonfires.</P>

<P>In the Lithuanian SSR there were mass killings of Soviet citizens, namely: in Panerai at least 100000; in Kaunas more than 70000; in Alitus about 60000; at Prenai more than 3000: in Villiampol about 8000; in Mariampol about 7000; in Trakai and neighbouring towns 37640.</P>

<P>In the Latvian SSR 577000 persons were murdered.</P>

<P>As a result of the whole system of internal order maintained in all camps, the interned persons were doomed to die.</P>

<P>In a secret instruction entitled "The Internal Regime in Concentration Camps", signed personally by Himmler in 1941 sere measures of punishment were set forth for the internees. Masses of prisoners of war were shot, or died from the cold and torture.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Now, Paragraph 2 of (D).</P>

<P>CAPTAIN V. V. KUCHIN (Assistant Prosecutor for the USSR) [Continuing the reading of the Indictment]: 2. In the Eastern Countries:</P>

<P>At Kragnevatz in Yugoslavia 2300 hostages were shot in 10/1941. At Kraljero in Yugoslavia 5000 hostages were shot.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT Will you turn now to (E), Paragraph 2, Page 21?</P>

<P>CAPT. KUCHIN 2. Eastern Countries:</P>

<P>During the occupation of the Eastern Countries the German Government and the German High Command carried out, as a systematic policy, a continuous course of plunder and destruction including:</P>

<P>On the territory of the Soviet Union the Nazi conspirators destroyed or severely damaged 1710 cities and more than 70000 villages and hamlets, more than 6 million buildings and rendered homeless about 25 million persons.</P>

<P>Among the cities which suffered most destruction are Stalingrad, Sevastopol, Kiev, Minsk, Odessa, Smolensk, Novgorod, Pskov, Orel, Kharkov, Voronezh, Rostov-on-Don, Stalino, and Leningrad.</P>

<P>As is evident from an official memorandum of the German Command, the Nazi conspirators planned the complete annihilation entire Soviet cities. In a completely secret order of the Chief of the Naval Staff (SKL Ia No. 1601/41, dated 9/29/1941) addressed only to Staff officers, it was said:</P>

<P>"The Fuehrer has decided to erase Petersburg from the face of the earth. The existence of this large city will have no further interest after Soviet Russia is destroyed. Finland has also said that the existence of this city on her new border is not desirable from her point of view. The original request of the Navy that docks, harbor, et cetera, necessary for the fleet be preserved is known to the Supreme Command of the German Armed Forces, but the basic principles of carrying out operations against Petersburg do not make it possible to satisfy this request.</P>

<P>"It is proposed to approach near to the city and to destroy it with the aid of an artillery barrage from weapons of different calibers and with long air attacks.</P>

<P>"The problem of the lives of the population and of their provisioning is a problem which cannot and must not be decided by us.</P>

<P>"In this war . . . we are not interested in preserving even a part of the population of this large city."</P>

<P>The Germans destroyed 427 museums, among them the wealthy museums of Leningrad, Smolensk, Stalingrad, Novgorod, Poltava, and others.</P>

<P>In Pyatigorsk the art objects brought there from the Rostov museum were seized.</P>

<P>The losses suffered by the coal mining industry alone in the Stalin region amount to 2 billion rubles. There was colossal destruction of industrial establishments in Makerevka, Carlovka, Yenakievo, Konstantinovka, Mariupol, from which most of the machinery and factories were removed.</P>

<P>Stealing of huge dimensions and the destruction of industrial, cultural, and other property was typified in Kiev. More than 4 million books, magazines, and manuscripts (many of which were very valuable and even unique) and a large number of artistic productions and divers valuables were stolen and carried away. Many valuable art productions were taken away from Riga.</P>

<P>The extent of the plunder of cultural valuables is evidenced by the fact that 100000 valuable volumes and 70 cases of ancient periodicals and precious monographs were carried away by Rosenberg's staff alone.</P>

<P>Among further examples of these crimes are:</P>

<P>Wanton devastation of the city of Novgorod and of many historical and artistic monuments there; wanton devastation and plunder of the city of Rovno and of its province; the destruction of the industrial, cultural, and other property in Odessa; the destruction of cities and villages in Soviet Karelia; the destruction in Estonia of cultural, industrial, and other buildings; the destruction of medical and prophylactic institutes; the destruction of agriculture and industry in Lithuania; the destruction of cities in Latvia.</P>

<P>The Germans approached monuments of culture, dear to the Soviet people, with special hatred. They broke up the estate of the poet Pushkin in Mikhailovskoye, desecrated his grave, and destroyed the neighboring villages and the Svyatogor monastery.</P>

<P>They destroyed the estate and museum of Leo Tolstoy, "Yasnaya Polyana" and desecrated the grave of the great writer. They destroyed, in Klin, the museum of Tchaikovsky and, in Penaty, the museum of the painter Repin and many others.</P>

<P>The Nazi conspirators destroyed 1,670 Greek Orthodox churches, 237 Roman Catholic churches, 67 chapels, 532 synagogues, et cetera.</P>

<P>They also broke up, desecrated and senselessly destroyed the most valuable monuments of the Christian Church, such as the Kievo-Pecherskaya Lavra, Novy Jerusalem in the Istrin region, and the most ancient monasteries and churches.</P>

<P>Destruction in Estonia of cultural, industrial, and other premises; burning down of many thousands of residential buildings; removal of 10000 works of art; destruction of medical and prophylactic institutions; plunder and removal to Germany of immense quantities of agricultural stock including horses, cows, pigs, poultry, beehives, and agricultural machines of all kinds.</P>

<P>Destruction of agriculture, enslavement of peasants, and looting of stock and produce in Lithuania.</P>

<P>In the Latvian Republic destruction of the agriculture by the looting of all stock, machinery, and produce.</P>

<P>Carrying away by Rosenberg's headquarters of 100000 valuable volumes and 70 cases of ancient periodicals and precious monographs; wanton destruction of libraries and other cultural buildings.</P>

<P>The result of this policy of plunder and destruction was to lay waste the land and cause utter desolation.</P>

<P>The over-all value of the material loss which the USSR has borne is computed to be 679 billion rubles, in State prices of 1941.</P>

<P>Following the German occupation of Czechoslovakia on 3/15/1939 the defendants seized and stole large stocks of raw materials copper, tin, iron, cotton, and food; caused to be taken to Germany large amounts of railway rolling stock, and many engines, carriages steam vessels and trolley buses; robbed libraries, laboratories, and art museums of books, pictures, objects of art, scientific apparatus and furniture; stole all gold reserves and foreign exchange of Czechoslovakia, including 23000 kilograms of gold, of a nominal value of 5.265 million Pounds; fraudulently acquired control and thereafter looted the Czech banks and many Czech industrial enter prises; and otherwise stole, looted, and misappropriated Czechoslovak public and private property. The total sum of defendants economic spoliation of Czechoslovakia from 1938-1945 is estimated at 200 billion Czechoslovak crowns.</P>

<P>(G) Wanton destruction of cities, towns, and villages, and devastation not justified by military necessity.</P>

<P>The defendants wantonly destroyed cities . . .</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Will you go to Paragraph 2 of (G) The French read the first paragraph. Do you want to go to Paragraph 2 of (G)</P>

<P>CAPT. KUCHIN: I have begun . . .</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I thought we had read Paragraph 1. We might take up at Paragraph 2, beginning "In the Eastern Countries the defendants pursued . . ."</P>

<P>CAPT. KUCHIN: 2. Eastern Countries:</P>

<P>In the Eastern Countries the defendants pursued a policy of wanton destruction and devastation; some particulars of this, without prejudice to the production of evidence of other cases, are set out above under the heading "Plunder of Public and Private Property".</P>

<P>In Greece in 1941 the villages of Amelofito, Kliston, Kizonia, Messovunos, Selli, Ano-Kerzilion, and Kato-Kerzilion were utterly destroyed.</P>

<P>In Yugoslavia on 8/15/1941 the German military command officially announced that the village of Skela was burned to the ground and the inhabitants killed on the order of the command.</P>

<P>On the order of the Field Commander Hoersterberg a punitive expedition from the SS troops and the field police destroyed the villages of Machkovats and Kriva Reka in Serbia and all the inhabitants were killed.</P>

<P>General Fritz Neidhold (369 Infantry Division), on 9/11/1944, gave an order to destroy the villages of Zagniezde and Udora, hanging all the men and driving away all the women and children.</P>

<P>In Czechoslovakia the Nazi conspirators also practiced the senseless destruction of populated places. Lezaky and Lidice were burnt to the ground and the inhabitants killed.</P>

<P>H) Conscription of civilian labor.</P>

<P>Throughout the occupied territories the defendants conscripted and forced the inhabitants to labor and requisitioned their services ....</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I think Paragraph (H) has been read, the first paragraph of it. There only remains for you to read Paragraph 2 of (H).</P>

<P>CAPT. KUCHIN: 2. Eastern Countries:</P>

<P>Of the large number of citizens of the Soviet Union and of Czechoslovakia referred to under Count Three VIII (B) 2 above, many were so conscripted for forced labor.</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>Charter, Article 6, especially 6 (c).</P>

<P>X. Statement of the offense.</P>

<P>All the defendants committed Crimes against Humanity during a period of years preceding 5/8/1945, in Germany and in all those countries and territories occupied by the German Armed Forces since 9/1/1939, and in Austria and Czechoslovakia and in Italy and on the High Seas.</P>

<P>All the defendants, acting in concert with others, formulated and executed a Common Plan or Conspiracy to commit Crimes against Humanity as defined in Article 6 (c) of the Charter. This plan involved among other things, the murder and persecution of all who were or who were suspected of being hostile to the Nazi Party and all who were or who were suspected of being opposed to the common plan alleged in Count One.</P>

<P>The said Crimes against Humanity were committed by the defendants, and by other persons for whose acts the defendants are responsible (under Article 6 of the Charter) as such other persons, when committing the said War Crimes, performed their acts in execution of a Common Plan and Conspiracy to commit the said War Crimes, in the formulation and execution of which plan nd conspiracy all the defendants participated as leaders, organizers, instigators, and accomplices.</P>

<P>These methods and crimes constituted violations of international conventions, of internal penal laws, of the general principles of criminal law as derived from the criminal law of all civilized nations, and were involved in and part of a systematic course of conduct. The said acts were contrary to Article 6 of the Charter.</P>

<P>The Prosecution will rely upon the facts pleaded under Count Three as also constituting Crimes against Humanity.</P>

<P>(A) Murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against civilian populations before and during the war.</P>

<P>For the purposes set out above, the defendants adopted a policy of persecution, repression, and extermination of all civilians in Germany who were, or who were believed to, or who were believed likely to become, hostile to the Nazi Government and the Common Plan or Conspiracy described in Count One. They imprisoned such persons without judicial process, holding them in "protective custody" and concentration camps, and subjected them to persecution degradation, despoilment, enslavement, torture, and murder.</P>

<P>Special courts were established to carry out the will of the conspirators; favored branches or agencies of the State and Party were permitted to operate outside the range even of nazified law and to crush all tendencies and elements which were considered "undesirable". The various concentration camps included Buchenwald. which was established in 1933, and Dachau, which was established in 1934. At these and other camps the civilians were put to slave labor and murdered and ill-treated by divers means, including those set out in Count Three above, and these acts and policies were continued and extended to the occupied countries after the 9/1/1939-5/8/1945.</P>

<P>(B) Persecution on political, racial, and religious grounds in execution of and in connection with the common plan mentioned in Count One.</P>

<P>As above stated, in execution of and in connection with the common plan mentioned in Count One, opponents of the German Government were exterminated and persecuted. These persecutions were directed against Jews. They were also directed against persons whose political belief or spiritual aspirations were deemed to be in conflict with the aims of the Nazis.</P>

<P>Jews were systematically persecuted since 1933; they were deprived of liberty, thrown into concentration camps where the were murdered and ill-treated. Their property was confiscated. Hundreds of thousands of Jews were so treated before the 9/1/1939. Since the 9/1/1939 the persecution of the Jews was redoubled; millions of Jews from Germany and from the occupied western Countries were sent to the Eastern Countries for extermination.</P>

<P>Particulars by way of example and without prejudice to the production of evidence of other cases are as follows:</P>

<P>The Nazis murdered amongst others Chancellor Dollfuss, the Social Democrat Breitscheid, and the Communist Thalmann. They imprisoned in concentration camps numerous political and religious personages for example, Chancellor Schuschnigg and Pastor Niemoeller.</P>

<P>In 11/1938, by orders of the Chief of the Gestapo, anti-Jewish demonstrations all over Germany took place. Jewish property was destroyed; 30000 Jews were arrested and sent to concentration camps and their property confiscated.</P>

<P>Under paragraph VIII (A), above, millions of the persons there mentioned as having been murdered and ill-treated were Jews.</P>

<P>Among other mass murders of Jews were the following:</P>

<P>At Kislovodsk all Jews were made to give up their property; 2000 were shot in an anti-tank ditch at Mineralniye Vodi; 4300 other Jews were shot in the same ditch; 60000 Jews were shot on an island on the Dvina near Riga; 20000 Jews were shot at Lutsk; 32000 Jews were shot at Sarny; 60000 Jews were shot at Kiev and Dniepropetrovsk.</P>

<P>Thousands of Jews were gassed weekly by means of gas-wagons which broke down from overwork.</P>

<P>As the Germans retreated before the Soviet Army they exterminated Jews rather than allow them to be liberated. Many concentration camps and ghettos were set up in which Jews were incarcerated and tortured, starved, subjected to merciless atrocities, and finally exterminated.</P>

<P>About 70000 Jews were exterminated in Yugoslavia.</P>

<P>XI. Individual group and organization responsibility for the offense stated in Count Four.</P>

<P>Reference is hereby made to Appendix A of this Indictment for Statement of the responsibility of the individual defendants for thee offense set forth in this Count Four of the Indictment. Reference is hereby made to Appendix B of this Indictment for a statement of the responsibility of the groups and organizations named herein as criminal groups and organizations for the offense forth in the Count Four of the Indictment.</P>

<P>Wherefore, this Indictment is lodged with the Tribunal in English, French, and Russian, each text having equal authenticity, and the charges herein made against the above-named defendants are hereby presented to the Tribunal.</P>

<P>Hartley Shawcross, acting on behalf of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; Robert H. Jackson, acting on behalf of the United States of America; Francois de Menthon acting on behalf of the French Republic; R. Rudenko, acting on behalf of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Berlin, 10/6/1945.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Has anybody been designated to read the appendices?</P>

<P>MR. ALDERMAN: May it please the Tribunal, I shall read Appendix A and Appendix B, and the British Delegation will read Appendix C. One word of explanation as to Appendix A. The Court will have observed that the defendants are seated in the dock in the same order in which they are named in the Indictment By a mechanical slip-up they are not named in Appendix A in exactly the same order. I think it would be too much difficult for the interpreters or for me to arrange them in the same order. and if the Court will permit I will read Appendix A as it is printed. [=]</P>

<P>The statements hereinafter set forth, following the name of each organization named in the Indictment as one which should be declared criminal constitute matters upon which the Prosecution will rely inter alia as establishing the criminality of the group or organization.</P>

<P>"Die Reichsregierung (Reich Cabinet)" referred to in the Indictment consists of persons who were:</P>

<P>(i) Members of the ordinary cabinet after 1/30/1933, the date on which Hitler became Chancellor of the German Republic. The term "ordinary cabinet" as used herein means the Reich Ministers, i. e., heads of departments of the central Government; Reich Ministers without portfolio; State Ministers acting as Reich Ministers; and other officials entitled to take part in meetings of this cabinet.</P>

<P>(ii) Members of Der Ministerrat fuer die Reichsverteidigung (council of Ministers for the Defense of the Reich).</P>

<P>(iii) Members of Der Geheime Kabinettsrat (Secret Cabinet Council). Under the Fuehrer, these persons functioning in the foregoing capacities and in association as a group, possessed and exercised legislative, executive, administrative, and political powers and functions of a very high order in the system of German Government. Accordingly, they are charged with responsibility for the policies adopted and put into effect by the Government including those which comprehended and involved the commission of the crimes referred to in Counts One, Two, Three, and Four of the Indictment.</P>

<P>"Das Korps der Politischen Leiter der Nationalsozialistischen Deutschen Arbeiterpartei (Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party)" referred to in the Indictment consists of persons who were at any time according to common Nazi terminology, "Politische Leiter" (Political Leaders) of any grade or rank.</P>

<P>The Politischen Leiter comprised the leaders of the various functional offices of the Party (for example, the Reichsleitung or Party Reich Directorate and the Gauleitung, or Party Gau Directorate), as well as the territorial leaders of the Party (for example, the Gauleiter).</P>

<P>The Politischen Leiter were a distinctive and elite group within the Nazi Party proper and as such were vested with special prerogatives They were organized according to the Leadership Principle and were charged with planning, developing, and imposing upon their followers the policies of the Nazi Party. Thus the territorial leaders among them were called Hoheitstraeger, or bearers of sovereignty, and were entitled to call upon and utilize the various Party formations when necessary for the execution of Party policies.</P>

<P>Reference is hereby made to the allegations in Count One of the Indictment showing that the Nazi Party was the central core of the Common Plan or Conspiracy therein set forth. The Politischen Leiter, as a major power within the Nazi Party proper and functioning in the capacities above described and in association as a group, joined in the Common Plan or Conspiracy, and accordingly share responsibility for the crimes set forth in Counts One, Two, Three, and Four of the Indictment.</P>

<P>The Prosecution expressly reserves the right to request, at any time before sentence is pronounced, that Politischer Leiter of subordinate grades or ranks or of other types or classes, to be specified by the prosecution, be excepted from further proceedings in this Case Number 1, but without prejudice to other proceedings or actions against them.</P>

<P>"Die Schutzstaffeln der Nationalsozialistischen Deutschen Arbeiterpartei (commonly known as the SS) including Der Sicherheitsdienst (commonly known as the SD)" referred to in the Indictment consists of the entire corps of the SS and all offices, departments services, agencies, branches, formations, organizations, and groups of which it was at any time comprised or which were at any time integrated in it, including but not limited to, the Allgemeine SS, the Waffen SS, the SS Totenkopf Verbaende, SS Polizei Regimenter and the Sicherheitsdienst des Reichsfuehrers SS (commonly known as the SD).</P>

<P>The SS, originally established by Hitler in 1925 as an elite section of the SA to furnish a protective guard for the Fuehrer and Nazi Party leaders, became an independent formation of the Nazi Party in 1934 under the leadership of the Reichsfuehrer SS, Heinrich Himmler. It was composed of voluntary members, selected in accordance with Nazi biological, racial, and political theories, completely indoctrinated in Nazi ideology and pledged to uncompromising obedience to the Fuehrer. After the accession of the Nazi conspirators to power, it developed many departments, agencies formations, and branches and extended its influence and control over numerous fields of governmental and Party activity. Through Heinrich Himmler, as Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the German Police, agencies and units of the SS and of the Reich were joined in operation to form a unified repressive police force. The Sicherheitsdienst des Reichsfuehrers SS (commonly known as the SD), a department of the SS, was developed into a vast espionage and counter-intelligence system which operated in conjunction with the Gestapo and criminal police in detecting, suppressing, and eliminating tendencies, groups, and individuals deemed hostile or potentially to the Nazi Party, its leaders, principles, and objectives, and eventually was combined with the Gestapo and criminal police in a single security police department, the Reich Main Security.</P>

<P>Other branches of the SS developed into an armed force and served in the wars of aggression referred to in Counts One and Two of the Indictment. Through other departments and branches the SS controlled the administration of concentration camps and the execution of Nazi racial, biological, and resettlement policies. Through its numerous functions and activities it served as the instrument for insuring the domination of Nazi ideology and protecting and extending the Nazi regime over Germany and occupied territories. It thus participated in and is responsible for the crimes referred to in Counts One, Two, Three, and Four of the Indictment. [=]</P>

<P>"Die Geheime Staatspolizei (Secret State Police, commonly known as the Gestapo)" referred to in the Indictment consists of the headquarters departments, offices, branches, and all the forces and personnel of the Geheime Staatspolizei organized or existing at any time after 1/30/1933, including the Geheime Staatspolizei of Prussia and equivalent secret or political police forces of the Reich and the components thereof.</P>

<P>The Gestapo was created by the Nazi conspirators immediately after their accession to power, first in Prussia by the Defendant Goering and shortly thereafter in all other states in the Reich. These separate secret and political police forces were developed into a centralized, uniform organization operating through a central headquarters and through a network of regional offices in Germany and in occupied territories. Its officials and operatives were selected on the basis of unconditional acceptance of Nazi ideology, were largely drawn from members of the SS, and were trained in SS and SD schools. It acted to suppress and eliminate tendencies, groups, and individuals deemed hostile or potentially hostile to the Nazi Party, its leaders, principles, and objectives, and to repress resistance and potential resistance to German control in occupied territories. In performing these functions it operated free from control, taking any measures it deemed necessary for the accomplishment of its missions.</P>

<P>Through its purposes, activities and the means it used, it participated in and is responsible for the commission of the crimes set forth in Counts One, Two, Three, and Four of the Indictment.</P>

<P>"Die Sturmabteilungen der Nationalsozialistischen Deutschen Arbeiterpartei (commonly known as the SA)." That organization referred to in the Indictment was a formation of the Nazi Party under the immediate jurisdiction of the Fuehrer, organized on military lines, whose membership was composed of volunteers serving as political soldiers of the Party. It was one of the earliest formations of the Nazi Party and the original guardian of the National Socialist movement. Founded in 1921 as a voluntary military formation, it was developed by the Nazi conspirators before their accession to power into a vast private army and utilized for the purpose of creating disorder, and terrorizing and eliminating political opponents. It continued to serve as an instrument for the physical, ideological, and military training of Party members and as a reserve for the German Armed Forces. After the launching of the wars of aggression, referred to in Counts One and Two of the Indictment, the SA not only operated as an organization for military training but provided auxiliary police and security forces in occupied territories, guarded prisoner-of-war camps and concentration camps and supervised and controlled persons forced to labor in Germany and occupied territories.</P>

<P>Through its purposes and activities and the means it used it participated in and is responsible for the commission of the crimes set forth in Counts One, Two, Three, and Four of the Indictment.</P>

<P>The "General Staff and High Command of the German Armed Forces" referred to in the Indictment consists of those individuals who between 2/1938-5/1945 were the highest commanders of the Wehrmacht, the Army, the Navy, and the Air Forces.

<P>Morning Session</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: A motion has been filed with the Tribunal and the Tribunal has given it consideration, and insofar as it may be a plea to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, it conflicts with Article 3 of the Charter and will not be entertained. Insofar as it may contain other arguments which may be open to the defendants, they may be heard at a later stage.</P>

<P>And now, in accordance with Article 24 of the Charter, which provides that, after the Indictment has been read in court, the defendants shall be called upon to plead guilty or not guilty, I now direct the defendants to plead either guilty or not guilty.</P>

<P>DR. DIX: May I speak to Your Lordship for just a moment?</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: You may not speak to me in support of the motion with which I have just dealt on behalf of the Tribunal. I have told you that so far as that motion is a plea to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, it conflicts with Article 3 of the Charter and will not be entertained. Insofar as it contains or may contain arguments which may be open to the defendants, those arguments may be heard hereafter.</P>

<P>DR. DIX: I do not wish to speak on the subject of a motion. As speaker for the Defense I should like to broach a technical question and voice a question to this effect on behalf of the Defense. May I do so? The Defense Counsel were forbidden to talk to the defendants this morning. It is absolutely necessary that the Defense Counsel should be able to speak to the defendants before the session It often happens that after the session one cannot reach ones client at night. It is quite possible that counsel may have prepared something overnight which he wishes to discuss with the defendant before the session. According to our experience it is always permissible for the Defense Counsel to speak to the defendant before the session. The question of conferring between Defense Counsel and clients during sessions could be dealt with at a later date.</P>

<P>At present I request, on behalf of the entire Defense, that we allowed to confer with our clients in the courtroom, into which they usually are brought at a very early hour. Otherwise, we shall not be in a position to conduct the defense in an efficient and appropriate matter.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I am afraid that you cannot consult with your clients in the courtroom except by written communication. When you are out of the courtroom, security regulations can be carried out and, so far as those security regulations go, you have full opportunity to consult with your clients. In the courtroom we must confine you to written communications to your clients. At the end of each day's sitting, you will have full opportunity to consult with them in private.</P>

<P>DR. DIX: I shall discuss this with my colleagues of the Defense and we should like if possible to return to this question.</P>

<P>DR. THOMA: May I have the floor?</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Will you state your name please.</P>

<P>DR. THOMA: Dr. Ralph Thoma. I represent the Defendant Rosenberg. Yesterday my client gave me a statement as regards the question of guilt or innocence. I took this statement and promised him to talk with him about it. Neither last night nor this morning have I had an opportunity to talk with him; and, consequently neither I nor my client are in a position to make a statement today as to whether he is guilty or not guilty. I therefore request that the proceedings be interrupted so that I may speak with my client.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Thoma, the Tribunal will be prepared to adjourn for 15 minutes in order that you may have an opportunity of consulting with your clients.</P>

<P>DR. THOMA: Thank you. I should like to make another statement. Some of my colleagues have just told me that they are in the same position as I, particularly Dr. Sauter . . .</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: I meant that all defendants' counsel should have an opportunity of consulting with their clients; but I would point out to the defendants' counsel that they have had several weeks' preparation for this Trial, and that they must have anticipated that the provisions of Article 24 would be followed. But now we will adjourn for 15 minutes in which all of you may consult with your clients.</P>

<P>DR. THOMA: May I say something further in that respect, Your Honor.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</P>

<P>DR. THOMA: The Defense asked whether the question of guilt or not guilty could only be answered with "yes", or "no" or whether a more extensive and longer statement could be made. We obtained information on this point only the day before yesterday. We therefore have had no opportunity to confer at length with our clients on this matter.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: One moment. The question will have to be answered in the words of Article 24 of the Charter, and those words are printed in italics: "The Tribunal shall ask each defendant whether he pleads guilty or not guilty." That is what they have got to do at that stage. Of course, the defendants will have a full opportunity themselves, if they are called as witnesses, and by their counsel, to make their defense fully at a later stage.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: May it please Your Honors:</P>

<P>The privilege of opening the first trial in history for crimes against the peace of the world imposes a grave responsibility. The wrongs which we seek to condemn and punish have been so calculated, so malignant, and so devastating, that civilization cannot tolerate their being ignored, because it cannot survive their being repeated. That four great nations, flushed with victory and stung with injury stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law is one of the most significant tributes that Power has ever paid to Reason.</P>

<P>This Tribunal, while it is novel and experimental, is not the product of abstract speculations nor is it created to vindicate legalistic theories. This inquest represents the practical effort of four of the most mighty of nations, with the support of 17 more, to utilize international law to meet the greatest menace of our timesaggressive war. The common sense of mankind demands that law shall not stop with the punishment of petty crimes by little people. It must also reach men who possess themselves of great power and make deliberate and concerted use of it to set in motion evils which leave no home in the world untouched. It is a cause of that magnitude that the United Nations will lay before Your Honors.</P>

<P>In the prisoners' dock sit twenty-odd broken men. Reproached by the humiliation of those they have led almost as bitterly as by the desolation of those they have attacked, their personal capacity for evil is forever past. It is hard now to perceive in these men as captives the power by which as Nazi leaders they once dominated much of the world and terrified most of it. Merely as individuals their fate is of little consequence to the world.</P>

<P>What makes this inquest significant is that these prisoners represent sinister influences that will lurk in the world long after their bodies have returned to dust. We will show them to be living symbols of racial hatreds, of terrorism and violence, and of the arrogance and cruelty of power. They are symbols of fierce nationalisms and of militarism, of intrigue and war- making which have embroiled Europe generation after generation, crushing its manhood, destroying its homes, and impoverishing its life. They have so identified themselves with the philosophies they conceived and with the forces they directed that any tenderness to them is a victory and an encouragement to all the evils which are attached to their names. Civilization can afford no compromise with the social forces which would gain renewed strength if we deal ambiguously or indecisively With the men in whom those forces now precariously survive.</P>

<P>What these men stand for we will patiently and temperately disclose. We will give you undeniable proofs of incredible events. the catalog of crimes will omit nothing that could be conceived by a pathological pride, cruelty, and lust for power. These men created in Germany, under the "Fuehrerprinzip", a National Socialist despotism equalled only by the dynasties of the ancient East. They took from the German people all those dignities and freedoms that we hold natural and inalienable rights in every human being. The people were compensated by inflaming and gratifying hatreds towards those who were marked as "scapegoats". Against their opponents, including Jews, Catholics, and free labor, the Nazis directed such a campaign of arrogance, brutality, and annihilation as the world has not witnessed since the pre-Christian ages. They excited the German ambition to be a "master race", which of course implies serfdom for others. They led their people on a mad gamble for domination. They diverted social energies and resources to the creation of what they thought to be an invincible war machine They overran their neighbors. To sustain the "master race" in its war-making, they enslaved millions of human beings and brought them into Germany, where these hapless creatures now wander as "displaced persons". At length bestiality and bad faith reached such excess that they aroused the sleeping strength of imperiled Civilization. Its united efforts have ground the German war machine to fragments. But the struggle has left Europe a liberated yet prostrate land where a demoralized society struggles to survive. These are the fruits of the sinister forces that sit with these defendants in the prisoners' dock.</P>

<P>In justice to the nations and the men associated in this prosecution, I must remind you of certain difficulties which may leave their mark on this case. Never before in legal history has an effort been made to bring within the scope of a single litigation the developments of a decade, covering a whole continent, and involving a score of nations, countless individuals, and innumerable events. Despite the magnitude of the task, the world has demanded immediate action. This demand has had to be met, though perhaps at the cost of finished craftsmanship. In my country, established courts, following familiar procedures, applying well-thumbed precedents, and dealing with the legal consequences of local and limited events seldom commence a trial within a year of the event in litigation. Yet less than 8 months ago today the courtroom in which you sit was an enemy fortress in the hands of German SS troops. Less than 8 months ago nearly all our witnesses and documents were in enemy hands. The law had not been codified, no procedures had been established, no tribunal was in existence, no usable courthouse stood here, none of the hundreds of tons of official German documents had been examined, no prosecuting staff had been assembled, nearly all of the present defendants were at large, and the four prosecuting powers had not yet joined in common cause to try them. I should be the last to deny that the case may well suffer from incomplete researches and quite likely will not be the example of professional work which any of the prosecuting nations would normally wish to sponsor. It is, however, a completely adequate case to the judgment we shall ask you to render and its full development we shall be obliged to leave to historians.</P>

<P>Before I discuss particulars of evidence, some general considerations which may affect the credit of this trial in the eyes of the world should be candidly faced. There is a dramatic disparity between the circumstances of the accusers and of the accused that might discredit our work if we should falter, in even minor matters, in being fair and temperate.</P>

<P>Unfortunately the nature of these crimes is such that both prosecution and judgment must be by victor nations over vanquished foes. The worldwide scope of the aggressions carried out by these men has left but few real neutrals. Either the victors must judge the vanquished or we must leave the defeated to judge themselves. After the first World War, we learned the futility of the latter course. The former high station of these defendants, the notoriety of their acts, and the adaptability of their conduct to provoke retaliation make it hard to distinguish between the demand for a just and measured retribution, and the unthinking cry for vengeance which arises from the anguish of war. It is our task, so far as humanly possible, to draw the line between the two. We must never forget that the record on which we judge these defendants today is the record on which history will judge us tomorrow. To pass these defendants a poisoned chalice is to put it to our own lips as well. We must summon such detachment and intellectual integrity to our task that this Trial will commend itself to posterity as fulfilling humanity's aspirations to do justice.</P>

<P>At the very outset, let us dispose of the contention that to put these men to trial is to do them an injustice entitling them to some special consideration These defendants may be hard pressed but they are not ill used. Let us see what alternative they would have to being tried.</P>

<P>More than a majority of these prisoners surrendered to or were tracked down by the forces of the United States. Could they expect us to make American custody a shelter for our enemies against the just wrath of our Allies? Did we spend American lives to capture them only to save them from punishment? Under the principles of the Moscow Declaration, those suspected war criminals who are not to be tried internationally must be turned over to individual governments for trial at the scene of their outrages. Many less responsible and less culpable American-held prisoners have been and will continue to be turned over to other United Nations for local trial. If these defendants should succeed, for any reason, in escaping the condemnation of this Tribunal, or if they obstruct or abort the trial, those who are American-held prisoners will be delivered to our continental Allies. For these defendants, however, we have set up an International Tribunal and have undertaken the burden of participating in a complicated effort to give them fair and dispassionate hearings. That is the best- known protection to any man with a defense worthy of being heard. [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>If these men are the first war leaders of a defeated nation to be prosecuted in the name of the law, they are also the first to be given a chance to plead for their lives in the name of the law. Realistically, the Charter of this Tribunal, which gives them a hearing, is also the source of their only hope. It may be that these men of troubled conscience, whose only wish is that the world forget them, do not regard a trial as a favor. But they do have a fair opportunity to defend themselvesa favor which these men, when in power, rarely extended to their fellow countrymen. Despite the fact that public opinion already condemns their acts, we agree that here they must be given a presumption of innocence and we accept the burden of proving criminal acts and the responsibility of these defendants for their commission.</P>

<P>When I say that we do not ask for convictions unless we prove crime, I do not mean mere technical or incidental transgression of international conventions. We charge guilt on planned and intended conduct that involves moral as well as legal wrong. And we do not mean conduct that is a natural and human, even if illegal cutting of corners, such as many of us might well have committed had we been in the defendants' positions. It is not because the yielded to the normal frailties of human beings that we accuse them. It is their abnormal and inhuman conduct which brings them to this bar.</P>

<P>We will not ask you to convict these men on the testimony of their foes. There is no count in the Indictment that cannot be proved by books and records. The Germans were always meticulous record keepers, and these defendants had their share of the Teutonic passion for thoroughness in putting things on paper. Nor were they without vanity. They arranged frequently to be photographed in action. We will show you their own films. You will see their own conduct and hear their own voices as these defendants re-enact for you. from the screen, some of the events in the course of the conspiracy.</P>

<P>We would also make clear that we have no purpose to incriminate the whole German people. We know that the Party was not put in power by a majority of the German vote. We know it came to power by an evil alliance between the most extreme of the Nazi revolutionists, the most unrestrained of the German reactionaries and the most aggressive of the German militarists. If the German populace had willingly accepted the Nazi program, no Storm-troopers would have been needed in the early days of the Party and there would have been no need for concentration camps or the Gestapo, both of which institutions were inaugurated as soon as the Nazis gained control of the German State. Only after these lawless innovations proved successful at home they taken abroad.</P>

<P>The German people should know by now that the people of United States hold them in no fear, and in no hate. It is true that Germans have taught us the horrors of modern warfare, the ruin that lies from the Rhine to the Danube shows that we, like our Allies, have not been dull pupils. If we are not awed by German fortitude and proficiency in war, and if we are not persuaded of their political maturity, we do respect their skill in the arts of peace, their technical competence, and the sober, industrious, and self-disciplined character of the masses of the German people. In 1933 we saw the German people recovering prestige in the commercial, industrial, and artistic world after the set-back of the last war. We beheld their progress neither with envy nor malice. The Nazi regime interrupted this advance. The recoil of the Nazi aggression has left Germany in ruins. The Nazi readiness to pledge the German word without hesitation and to break it without shame has fastened upon German diplomacy a reputation for duplicity that will handicap it for years. Nazi arrogance has made the boast of the "master race" a taunt that will be thrown at Germans the world over for generations. The Nazi nightmare has given the German name a new and sinister significance throughout the world which will retard Germany a century. The German, no less than the non-German world, has accounts to settle with these defendants.</P>

<P>The fact of the war and the course of the war, which is the central theme of our case, is history. From 9/1/1939, when the German armies crossed the Polish frontier, until 9/1942, when they met epic resistance at Stalingrad, German arms seemed invincible. Denmark and Norway, the Netherlands and France, Belgium and Luxembourg, the Balkans and Africa, Poland and the Baltic States, and parts of Russia, all had been overrun and conquered by swift, powerful, well-aimed blows. That attack on the peace of the world is the crime against international society which brings into international cognizance crimes in its aid preparation which otherwise might be only internal concerns. It was aggressive war, which the nations of the world had renounced. It was war in violation of treaties, by which the peace of the world was sought to be safe-guarded.</P>

<P>This war did not just happenit was planned and prepared for over a long period of time and with no small skill and cunning. The world has perhaps never seen such a concentration and stimulation of the energies of any people as that enabled Germany 20 years after it was defeated, disarmed, and dismembered to come so near carrying out its plan to dominate Europe. Whatever else we may say of those who were the authors of this war, they did achieve a stupendous work in organization, and our first task is to examine the means by which these defendants and their fellow conspirators prepared and incited Germany to go to war.</P>

<P>In general, our case will disclose these defendants all uniting at some time with the Nazi Party in a plan which they well knew could be accomplished only by an outbreak of war in Europe. Their seizure of the German State, their subjugation of the German people, their terrorism and extermination of dissident elements their planning and waging of war, their calculated and planned ruthlessness in the conduct of warfare, their deliberate and planned criminality toward conquered peoples, all these are ends for which they acted in concert; and all these are phases of the conspiracy, a conspiracy which reached one goal only to set out for another and more ambitious one. We shall also trace for you the intricate web of organizations which these men formed and utilized to accomplish these ends. We will show how the entire structure of offices and officials was dedicated to the criminal purposes and committed to the use of the criminal methods planned by these defendants and their co-conspirators, many of whom war and suicide have put beyond reach.</P>

<P>It is my purpose to open the case, particularly under Count One of the Indictment, and to deal with the Common Plan or Conspiracy to achieve ends possible only by resort to Crimes against Peace, War Crimes, and Crimes against Humanity. My emphasis will not be on individual barbarities and perversions which may have occurred independently of any central plan. One of the dangers ever present is that this Trial may be protracted by details of particular wrongs and that we will become lost in a "wilderness of single instances". Nor will I now dwell on the activity of individual defendants except as it may contribute to exposition of the common plan.</P>

<P>The case as presented by the United States will be concerned with the brains and authority back of all the crimes. These defendants were men of a station and rank which does not soil its own hands with blood. They were men who knew how to use lessor folk as tools. We want to reach the planners and designers, the inciters and leaders without whose evil architecture the world would not have been for so long scourged with the violence and and wracked with the agonies and convulsions, of this terrible war.

<P>The Lawless Road to Power:</P>

<P>The chief instrumentality of cohesion in plan and action was the National Socialist German Workers Party, known as the Nazi Party. Some of the defendants were with it from the beginning. Others joined only after success seemed to have validated its lawlessness or power had invested it with immunity from the processes of the law. Adolf Hitler became its supreme leader or "Fuehrer" in 1921.</P>

<P>On the 2/24/1920, at Munich, it publicly had proclaimed its program (1708-PS). Some of its purposes would commend themselves to many good citizens, such as the demands for "profit-sharing in the great industries," "generous development of provision for old age," "creation and maintenance of a healthy middle class," "a land reform suitable to our national requirements," and "raising the standard of health." It also made a strong appeal to that sort of nationalism which in ourselves we call patriotism and in our rivals chauvinism. It demanded "equality of rights for the German people in its dealing with other nations, and the abolition of the peace treaties of Versailles and St. Germain." It demanded the "union of all Germans on the basis of the right of self-determination of peoples to form a Great Germany." It demanded "land and territory (colonies) for the enrichment of our people and the settlement of our surplus population." All of these, of course, were legitimate objectives if they were to be attained without resort to aggressive warfare.</P>

<P>The Nazi Party from its inception, however, contemplated war. It demanded the "abolition of mercenary troops and the formation of a national army." It proclaimed that: In view of the enormous sacrifice of life and property demanded of a nation by every war, personal enrichment through war must be regarded as a crime against the nation. We demand therefore, ruthless confiscation of all war profits."</P>

<P>I do not criticize this policy. Indeed, I wish it were universal. I merely wish to point out that in a time of peace, war was a preoccupation of the Party, and it started the work of making war less offensive to the masses of the people. With this it combined a program of physical training and sports for youth that became, as we shall see, the cloak for a secret program of military training.</P>

<P>The Nazi Party declaration also committed its members to a anti-Semitic program. It declared that no Jew or any person of non German blood could be a member of the nation. Such persons were to be disfranchised, disqualified for office, subject to the alien laws and entitled to nourishment only after the German population had first been provided for. All who had entered Germany after 8/2/1914 were to be required forthwith to depart, and a non-German immigration was to be prohibited.</P>

<P>The Party also avowed, even in those early days, an authoritarian and totalitarian program for Germany. It demanded creation of a strong central power with unconditional authority, nationalization of all businesses which had been "amalgamated," and a "reconstruction" of the national system of education which ''must aim at teaching the pupil to understand the idea of the State (state sociology)." Its hostility to civil liberties and freedom of the press was distinctly announced in these words: "It must be forbidden to publish newspapers which do not conduce to the national welfare. We demand the legal prosecution of all tendencies in art or literature of a kind likely to disintegrate our life as a nation and the suppression of institutions which might militate against the above requirements."</P>

<P>The forecast of religious persecution was clothed in the language of religious liberty, for the Nazi program stated, "We demand liberty for all religious denominations in the State." But, it continues with the limitation, "so far as they are not a danger to it and do not militate against the morality and moral sense of the German race."</P>

<P>The Party program foreshadowed the campaign of terrorism. It announced, "We demand ruthless war upon those whose activities are injurious to the common interests", and it demanded that such offenses be punished with death.</P>

<P>It is significant that the leaders of this Party interpreted this program as a belligerent one, certain to precipitate conflict. The Party platform concluded, "The leaders of the Party swear to proceed regardless of consequencesif necessary, at the sacrifice of their livestoward the fulfillment of the foregoing points." It is this Leadership Corps of the Party, not its entire membership, that stands accused before you as a criminal organization.</P>

<P>Let us now see how the leaders of the Party fulfilled their pledge to proceed regardless of consequences. Obviously, their foreign objectives, which were nothing less than to undo inter national treaties and to wrest territory from foreign control, as was most of their internal program, could be accomplished only by possession of the machinery of the German State. The first effort, accordingly, was to subvert the Weimar Republic by violent revolution. An abortive putsch at Munich in 1923 landed many of them in jail. A period of meditation which followed produced Mein Kampf, henceforth the source of law for the Party workers and a source of considerable revenue to its supreme leader. The Nazi plans for the violent overthrow of the feeble Republic then turned to plans for its capture.</P>

<P>No greater mistake could be made than to think of the Nazi party in terms of the loose organizations which we of the western world call "political parties". In discipline, structure, and method the Nazi Party was not adapted to the democratic process of persuasion. It was an instrument of conspiracy and of coercion. The Party was not organized to take over power in the German State by winning support of a majority of the German people; it was organized to seize power in defiance of the will of the people.</P>

<P>The Nazi Party, under the "Fuehrerprinzip," was bound by an iron discipline into a pyramid, with the Fuehrer, Adolf Hitler, at the top and broadening into a numerous Leadership Corps, composed of overlords of a very extensive Party membership at the base. By no means all of those who may have supported the movement in one way or another were actual Party members. The membership took the Party oath which in effect amounted to an abdication of personal intelligence and moral responsibility. This was the oath: "I vow inviolable fidelity to Adolf Hitler; I vow absolute obedience to him and to the leaders he designates for me." The membership in daily practice followed its leaders with an idolatry and self- surrender more Oriental than Western.</P>

<P>We will not be obliged to guess as to the motives or goal of the Nazi Party. The immediate aim was to undermine the Weimar Republic. The order to all Party members to work to that end was given in a letter from Hitler of 8/24/1931 to Rosenberg, of which we will produce the original. Hitler wrote:</P>

<P>"I am just reading in the Voelkischer Beobachter, edition 235/236, page 1, an article entitled "Does Wirth Intend To Come over?" The tendency of the article is to prevent on our part a crumbling away from the present form of government. I myself am travelling all over Germany to achieve exactly the opposite. May I therefore ask that my own paper will not stab me in the back with tactically unwise articles...." (047-PS)</P>

<P>Captured film enables us to present the Defendant Alfred Rosenberg who from the screen will himself tell you the story. The SA practiced violent interference with elections. We have the reports of the SD describing in detail how its members later violated the secrecy of elections in order to identify those who opposed them. One of the reports makes this explanation:</P>

<P>" .... The control was effected in the following way: some members of the election committee marked all the ballot papers with numbers. During the ballot itself, a voters' list was made up. The ballot-papers were handed out in numerical order, therefore it was possible afterwards with the aid of this list to find out the persons who cast 'No'-votes or invalid votes. One sample of these marked ballot-papers is enclosed The marking was done on the back of the ballot-papers with skimmed milk .... " (R-142) [=]</P>

<P>The Party activity, in addition to all the familiar forms of political contest, took on the aspect of a rehearsal for warfare. It utilized a Party formation, "Die Sturmabteilungen", commonly known as the SA. This was a voluntary organization of youthful and fanatical Nazis trained for the use of violence under semi-military discipline Its members began by acting as bodyguards for the Nazi leaders and rapidly expanded from defensive to offensive tactics. They became disciplined ruffians for the breaking up of opposition meetings and the terrorization of adversaries. They boasted that their task was to make the Nazi Party "master of the streets". The SA was the parent organization of a number of others. Its offspring include "Die Schutzstaffeln", commonly known as the SS formed in 1925 and distinguished for the fanaticism and cruelty of its members; "Der Sicherheitsdienst", known as the SD; and "Die Geheime Staatspolizei", the Secret State Police, the infamous Gestapo formed in 1934 after Nazi accession to power.</P>

<P>A glance at a chart of the Party organization is enough to show how completely it differed from the political parties we know. It had its own source of law in the Fuehrer and sub-Fuehrer. It had its own courts and its own police. The conspirators set up a government within the Party to exercise outside the law every sanction that any legitimate state could exercise and many that it could not. Its chain of command was military, and its formations were martial in name as well as in function. They were composed of battalions set up to bear arms under military discipline, motorized corps lying corps, and the infamous "Death Head Corps", which was not misnamed. The Party had its own secret police, its security units its intelligence and espionage division, its raiding forces, and its youth forces. It established elaborate administrative mechanisms to identify and liquidate spies and informers, to manage concentration camps, to operate death vans, and to finance the whole movement Through concentric circles of authority, the Nazi Party, as its leadership later boasted, eventually organized and dominated every phase of German lifebut not until they had waged a bitter internal struggle characterized by brutal criminality we charge here. In preparation for this phase of their struggle, they created a Party police system. This became the pattern and the instrument of the police state which was the first goal in their plan.</P>

<P>The Party formations, including the Leadership Corps of the art, the SD, the SS, the SA, and the infamous Secret State Police, Gestapo,all these stand accused before you as criminal organizations; organizations which, as we will prove from their own documents, were recruited only from recklessly devoted Nazis, ready in Conviction and temperament to do the most violent of deeds to advance the common program. They terrorized and silenced democratic opposition and were able at length to combine with political opportunists, militarists, industrialists, monarchists, and political reactionaries.</P>

<P>On 1/30/1933 Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of the German Republic. An evil combination, represented in the prisoners' dock by its most eminent survivors, had succeeded in possessing itself of the machinery of the German Government, a facade behind which they thenceforth would operate to make a reality of the war of conquest they so long had plotted. The conspiracy had passed into its second phase.</P>

<P>The Consolidation of Nazi Power:</P>

<P>We shall now consider the steps, which embraced the most hideous of Crimes against Humanity, to which the conspirators resorted in perfecting control of the German State and in preparing Germany for the aggressive war indispensable to their ends.</P>

<P>The Germans of the 1920's were a frustrated and baffled people as a result of defeat and the disintegration of their traditional government. The democratic elements, which were trying to govern Germany through the new and feeble machinery of the Weimar Republic, got inadequate support from the democratic forces of the rest of the world, including my country. It is not to be denied that Germany when worldwide depression was added to her other problems, was faced with urgent and intricate pressures in her economic and political life which necessitated bold measures.</P>

<P>The internal measures by which a nation attempts to solve its problems are ordinarily of no concern to other nations. But the Nazi Program from the first was recognized as a desperate program for a people still suffering the effects of an unsuccessful war. The Nazi Policy embraced ends recognized as attainable only by a renewal and a more successful outcome of war, in Europe. The conspirators' answer to Germany's problems was nothing less than to plot the regaining of territories lost in the First World War and the acquisition of other fertile lands of Central Europe by dispossessing or exterminating those who inhabited them. They also contemplated destroying or permanently weakening all other neighboring peoples so as to win virtual domination over Europe and probably of the world. The precise limits of their ambition we need not define for it was and is as illegal to wage aggressive a for small stakes as for large ones.</P>

<P>We find at this period two governments in Germany the real and the ostensible. The forms of the German Republic were maintained for a time, and it was the outward and visible government. But the real authority in the State was outside and above the law and rested in the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party.</P>

<P>On 2/27/1933, less than a month after Hitler became Chancellor, the Reichstag building was set on fire. The burning of this symbol of free parliamentary government was so providential for the Nazis that it was believed they staged the fire themselves. Certainly when we contemplate their known crimes, we cannot believe they would shrink from mere arson. It is not necessary however, to resolve the controversy as to who set the fire. The significant point is in the use that was made of the fire and of the state of public mind it produced. The Nazis immediately accused the Communist Party of instigating and committing the crime, and turned every effort to portray this single act of arson as the beginning of a communist revolution. Then, taking advantage of the hysteria, the Nazis met this phantom revolution with a real one In the following December the German Supreme Court with commendable courage and independence acquitted the accused Communists, but it was too late to influence the tragic course of events which the Nazi conspirators had set rushing forward.</P>

<P>Hitler, on the morning after the fire, obtained from the aged and ailing President Von Hindenburg a presidential decree suspending the extensive guarantees of individual liberty contained in the constitution of the Weimar Republic. The decree provided that:</P>

<P>"Sections 114, 115, 117, 118, 123, 124, and 153 of the Constitution of the German Reich are suspended until further notice. Thus, restrictions on personal liberty, on the right of free expression of opinion, including freedom of the press, on the right of assembly and the right of association, and violations of the privacy of postal, telegraphic, and telephonic communications, and warrants for house-searches, orders for confiscations as well as restrictions on property, are also permissible beyond the legal limits otherwise prescribed."

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>The extent of the restriction on personal liberty under the decree of 2/28/1933 may be understood by reference to the rights of the Weimar constitution which were suspended:</P>

<P>Article 114. The freedom of the person is inviolable. Curtailment or deprivation of personal freedom by a public authority is only permissible on a legal basis.</P>

<P>"Persons who have been deprived of their freedom must be informed at the latest on the following day by whose authority and for what reasons the deprivation of freedom was ordered; opportunity shall be afforded them without delay of submitting objections to their deprivation of freedom.</P>

<P>"Article 115. Every German's home is his sanctuary and is inviolable. Exceptions may only be made as provided by law.</P>

<P>"Article 117. The secrecy of letters and all postal, telegraphic and telephone communications is inviolable. Exceptions are inadmissible except by Reich law.</P>

<P>"Article 118. Every German has the right, within the limits of the general laws, to express his opinions freely in speech, in writing, in print, in picture form, or in any other way. No conditions of work or employment may detract from this right and no disadvantage may accrue to him from any person for making use of this right ....</P>

<P>"Article 123. All Germans have the right to assemble peacefully and unarmed without giving notice and without special permission.</P>

<P>"A Reich law may make previous notification obligatory for assemblies in the open air, and may prohibit them in case of immediate danger to the public safety.</P>

<P>"Article 124. All the Germans have the right to form associations or societies for purposes not contrary to criminal law. This right may not be curtailed by preventive measures. The same provisions apply to religious associations and societies.</P>

<P>Every association may become incorporated (Erwerb der Rechtsfaehigkeit) according to the provisions of the civil law. The right may not be refused to any association on the grounds that its aims are political, social-political, or religious.</P>

<P>"Article 153. Property is guaranteed by the Constitution. Its content and limits are defined by the laws. Expropriation can only take place for the public benefit and on a legal basis. Adequate compensation shall be granted, Unless a Reich law orders otherwise. In the case of dispute concerning the amount of compensation, it shall be possible to submit the matter to the ordinary civil courts, unless Reich laws determine otherwise. Compensation must be paid if the Reich expropriates property belonging to the Lands, Communes, or public utility associations.</P>

<P>"Property carries obligations. Its use shall also serve the common good." (2050-PS)</P>

<P>It must be said in fairness to Von Hindenburg that the constitution itself authorized him temporarily to suspend these fundamental rights "if the public safety and order in the German Reich are considerably disturbed or endangered." It must also be acknowledged that President Ebert previously had invoked this power.</P>

<P>But the National Socialist coup was made possible because the terms of the Hitler-Hindenburg decree departed from all previous ones in which the power of suspension had been invoked Whenever Ebert had suspended constitutional guarantees of individual rights, his decree had expressly revived the Protective Custody Act adopted by the Reichstag in 1916 during the previous war. This act guaranteed a judicial hearing within 24 hours of arrest, gave a right to have counsel and to inspect all relevant records, provided for appeal, and authorized compensation from Treasury funds for erroneous arrests.</P>

<P>The Hitler-Hindenburg decree of 2/28/1933 contained no such safeguards. The omission may not have been noted by Von Hindenburg. Certainly he did not appreciate its effect. It left the Nazi police and party formations, already existing and functioning under Hitler, completely unrestrained and irresponsible. Secret arrest and indefinite detention, without charges, without evidence, without hearing, without counsel, became the method of inflicting inhuman punishment on any whom the Nazi police suspected or disliked. No court could issue.an injunction, or writ of habeas corpus, or certiorari. The German people were in the hands of the police, the police were in the hands of the Nazi Party and the Party was in the hands of a ring of evil men, of whom the defendants here before you are surviving and representative leaders.</P>

<P>The Nazi conspiracy, as we shall show, always contemplated not merely overcoming current opposition but exterminating elements which could not be reconciled with its philosophy of the state. It not only sought to establish the Nazi "new order" but to secure its sway, as Hitler predicted, "for a thousand years." Nazis were never in doubt or disagreement as to what these dissident elements were. They were concisely described by one of the Colonel General Von Fritsch, on 12/11/1938 in these words:</P>

<P>Shortly after the first war I came to the conclusion that we would have to be victorious in three battles if Germany were to become powerful again: 1. The battle against the working class - Hitler has won this. 2. Against the Catholic Church, perhaps better expressed against Ultramontanism. 3. Against the Jews. (1947-PS)</P>

<P>The warfare against these elements was continuous. The battle Germany was but a practice skirmish for the worldwide drive them. We have in point of geography and of time two groups of Crimes against Humanityone within Germany before and during the war, the other in occupied territory during the war. But the two are not separated in Nazi planning. They are a continuous unfolding of the Nazi plan to exterminate peoples and nations which-might serve as a focus or instrument for overturning their "new world order" at any time. We consider these Crimes against humanity in this address as manifestations of the one Nazi plan and discuss them according to General Von Fritsch's classification. [=]</P>

<P>1. The Battle against the Working Class:</P>

<P>When Hitler came to power, there were in Germany three groups of trade unions. The General German Trade Union Confederation (ADGB) with 28 affiliated unions, and the General Independent Employees Confederation (AFA) with 13 federated unions together numbered more than 4.5 million members. The Christian Trade Union had over 1.25 million members.</P>

<P>The working people of Germany, like the working people of other nations, had little to gain personally by war. While labor is usually brought around to the support of the nation at war, labor by and large is a pacific, though by no means a pacifist force in the world. The working people of Germany had not forgotten in 1933 how heavy the yoke of the war lord can be. It was the workingmen who had joined the sailors and soldiers in the revolt of 1918 to end the first World War. The Nazis had neither forgiven no forgotten The Nazi program required that this part of the German population not only be stripped of power to resist diversion of its scanty comforts to armament, but also be wheedled or Whipped into new and unheard of sacrifices as a part of the Nazi war preparation. Labor must be cowed, and that meant its organizations and means of cohesion and defense must be destroyed.</P>

<P>The purpose to regiment labor for the Nazi Party was avowed by Ley in a speech to workers on 5/2/1933 as follows:</P>

<P>"You may say what else do you want, you have the absolute power. True we have the power, but we do not have the whole people, we do not have you workers 100 per cent, and it is you whom we want; we will not let you be until you stand with us in complete, genuine acknowledgment." (614-PS)</P>

<P>The first Nazi attack was upon the two larger unions. On 4/21/1933 an order not even in the name of the Government, but of the Nazi Party was issued by the conspirator Robert Ley as "Chief of Staff of the political organization of the NSDAP," applicable to the Trade Union Confederation and the Independent Employees Confederation. It directed seizure of their property and arrest of their principal leaders. The Party order directed Party organs which we here denounce as criminal associations the SA and SS "to be employed for the occupation of the trade union properties, and for the taking into custody of personalities who come into question." And it directed the taking into "protective custody" of all chairmen and district secretaries of such unions and branch directors of the labor bank. (392-PS)</P>

<P>These orders were carried out on 5/2/1933. All funds of the labor unions, including pension and benefit funds, were seized. Union leaders were sent to concentration camps. A few days later, on 5/10/1933, Hitler appointed Ley leader of the German Labor Front (Deutsche Arbeitsfront) which succeeded to the confiscated union funds. The German Labor Front, a Nazi controlled labor bureau, was set up under Ley to teach the Nazi philosophy to German workers and to weed out from industrial employment all who were backward in their lessons. (1940-PS) "Factory troops" were organized as an "ideological shock squad within the factor" (1817-PS). The Party order provided that "outside of the German Labor Front, no other organization (whether of workers or of employees) is to exist." On 6/24/1933 the remaining Christian Trade Unions were seized, pursuant to an order of the Nazi Party signed by Ley.</P>

<P>On 5/19/1933, this time by a government decree, it was provided that "trustees" of labor appointed by Hitler, should regulate the conditions of all labor contracts, replacing the former process of collective bargaining (405-PS). On 11/30/1934 a decree "regulating national labor" introduced the Fuehrer Principle into industrial relations. It provided that the owners of enter prises should be the "Fuehrer" and the workers should be the followers. The "enterprise-Fuehrer" should "make decisions for employees and laborers in all matters concerning the enterprise (1861-PS). It was by such bait that the great German industrialists were induced to support the Nazi cause, to their own ultimate ruin.</P>

<P>Not only did the Nazis dominate and regiment German labor but they forced the youth into the ranks of the laboring people thus led into chains. Under a compulsory labor service decree on 6/26/1935 young men and women between the ages of 18- 25 were conscripted for labor (1654-PS). Thus was the purpose to subjugate German labor accomplished. In the words of Ley, this accomplishment consisted "in eliminating the association character of the trade union and employees' associations, and in its place have substituted the conception 'soldiers of work'." The productive manpower of the German nation was in Nazi control. By these steps the defendants won the battle to liquidate labor unions as potential opposition and were enabled to impose upon the working class the burdens of preparing for aggressive warfare.</P>

<P>Robert Ley, the field marshal of the battle against labor, answered our Indictment with suicide. Apparently he knew no better answer. [=]</P>

<P>2. The Battle against the Churches:</P>

<P>The Nazi Party always was predominantly anti-Christian in its ideology. But we who believe in freedom of conscience and of religion base no charge of criminality on anybody's ideology. It is not because the Nazi themselves were irreligious or pagan, but because they persecuted others of the Christian faith that they become guilty of crime, and it is because the persecution was a step in the preparation for aggressive warfare that the offense becomes one of international consequence. To remove every moderating influence among the German people and to put its population on a total war footing, the conspirators devised and carried out a systematic and relentless repression of all Christian sects and churches.</P>

<P>We will ask you to convict the Nazis on their own evidence. Martin Bormann, in 6/1941, issued a secret decree on the relation of Christianity and National Socialism. The decree provided:</P>

<P>"For the first time in German history the Fuehrer consciously and completely has the leadership of the people in his own hand. With the Party, its components, and attached units the Fuehrer has created for himself and thereby the German Reich leadership an instrument which makes him independent of the church. All influences which might impair or damage the leadership of the people exercised by the Fuehrer with help of the NSDAP, must be eliminated. More and more the people must be separated from the churches and their organs, the pastors. Of course, the churches must and will, seen from their viewpoint, defend themselves against this loss of power. But never again must an influence on leadership of the people be yielded to the churches. This (influence) must be broken completely and finally.</P>

<P>"Only the Reich Government and by its direction the Party its components, and attached units have a right to leadership of the people. Just as the deleterious influences of astrologers, seers, and other fakers are eliminated and suppressed by the State, so must the possibility of church influence also be totally removed. Not until this has happened, does the State leadership have influence on the individual citizens. Not until then are people and Reich secure in their existence for all the future." (D-75)</P>

<P>And how the Party had been securing the Reich from Christian influence, will be proved by such items as this teletype from the Gestapo, Berlin, to the Gestapo, Nuremberg, on 7/24/1938. Let us hear their own account of events in Rottenburg.</P>

<P>"The Party on 7/23/1939 [Errata note: Volume II, Page 116, Line 16, change "1939" to "1938"] from 2100 on carried out the third demonstration against Bishop Sproll. Participants about 2500-3000 were brought in from outside by bus, etc. The Rottenburg populace again did not participate in the demonstration. This town took rather a hostile attitude to the demonstrations. The action got completely out of hand of the Party member responsible for it. The demonstrators stormed the palace, beat in the gates and doors. About 150 to 200 people forced their way into the palace, searched the rooms, threw files out of the windows and rummaged through the beds in the rooms of the palace. One bed was ignited. Before the fire got to the other objects of equipment in the rooms and the palace, the flaming bed could be thrown from the window and the fire extinguished. The Bishop was with Archbishop Groeber of Freiburg and the ladies and gentlemen of his menage in the chapel at prayer. About 25 to 30 people pressed into this chapel and molested those present. Bishop Groeber was taken for Bishop Sproll. He was grabbed by the robe and dragged back and forth. Finally the intruders realized that Bishop Groeber is not the one they are seeking. They could then be persuaded to leave the building. After the evacuation of the palace by the demonstrators I had an interview with Archbishop Groeber who left Rottenburg in the night. Groeber wants to turn to the Fuehrer and Reich Minister of the Interior, Dr. Frick, anew. On the course of the action, the damage done as well as the homage of the Rottenburg populace beginning today for the Bishop I shall immediately hand in a full report, after I am in the act of suppressing counter mass meetings ....</P>

<P>"In case the Fuehrer has instructions to give in this matter, I request that these be transmitted most quickly...." (848-PS)</P>

<P>Later, Defendant Rosenberg wrote to Bormann reviewing the proposal of Kerrl as Church Minister to place the Protestant church under State tutelage and proclaim Hitler its supreme head. Rosenberg was opposed, hinting that nazism was to suppress the christian Church completely after the war (See also 098-PS).</P>

<P>The persecution of all pacifist and dissenting sects, such as Jehovah's Witnesses and the Pentecostal Association, was peculiarly relentless and cruel. The policy toward the Evangelical Churches, however, was to use their influence for the Nazis' own purposes. In 9/1933 Mueller was appointed the Fuehrer's representative with power to deal with the "affairs of the Evangelical Church" in its relations to the State. Eventually, steps were taken to create a Reich Bishop vested with power to control this Church. A long conflict followed, Pastor Niemoller was sent to concentration camp, and extended interference with the internal discipline and administration of the churches occurred.</P>

<P>A most intense drive was directed against the Roman Catholic Church. After a strategic concordat with the Holy See, signed in 7/1933 in Rome, which never was observed by the Nazi Party, a long and persistent persecution of the Catholic Church, its priesthood, and its members, was carried out. Church schools and educational institutions were suppressed or subjected to requirements of Nazi teaching inconsistent with the Christian faith. The property of the Church was confiscated and inspired vandalism directed against Church property was left unpunished. Religious instruction was impeded and the exercise of religion made difficult. Priests and bishops were laid upon, riots were stimulated to harass them, and many were sent to concentration camps.</P>

<P>After occupation of foreign soil, these persecutions went on with greater vigor than ever. We will present to you from the files of the Vatican the earnest protests made by the Vatican to Ribbentrop summarizing the persecutions to which the priesthood and the Church had been subjected in this twentieth century under the Nazi regime. Ribbentrop never answered them. He could not deny. He dared not justify.</P>

<P>I now come to "Crimes against the Jews."</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: We shall now take our noon recess.</P>

<P>[A recess was taken until 1400 hours.] [=]</P>

<P>Afternoon Session</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will adjourn for 15 minutes half past 3 and will then continue until half past 4.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I was about to take up the "Crimes Committed against the Jews."</P>

<P>3. Crimes against the Jews:</P>

<P>The most savage and numerous crimes planned and committed by the Nazis were those against the Jews. Those in Germany in 1933 numbered about 500,000. In the aggregate, they had made for themselves positions which excited envy, and had accumulated properties which excited the avarice of the Nazis. They were few enough to be helpless and numerous enough to be held up as a menace.</P>

<P>Let there be no misunderstanding about the charge of persecuting Jews. What we charge against these defendants is not those arrogances and pretensions which frequently accompany the intermingling of different peoples and which are likely, despite the honest efforts of government, to produce regrettable crimes and convulsions. It is my purpose to show a plan and design, to which all Nazis were fanatically committed, to annihilate all Jewish people. These crimes were organized and promoted by the Party leadership, executed and protected by the Nazi officials, as we shall convince you by written orders of the Secret State Police itself.</P>

<P>The persecution of the Jews was a continuous and deliberate policy. It was a policy directed against other nations as well as against the Jews themselves. Anti-Semitism was promoted to divide and embitter the democratic peoples and to soften their resistance to the Nazi aggression. As Robert Ley declared in Der Angriff on 5/14/1944: "The second German secret weapon is Anti-semitism because if it is constantly pursued by Germany, it will become a universal problem which all nations will be forced to consider."</P>

<P>Anti-Semitism also has been aptly credited with being a "spear head of terror." The ghetto was the laboratory for testing repressive measures. Jewish property was the first to be expropriated but the custom grew and included similar measures against anti Nazi Germans, Poles, Czechs, Frenchmen, and Belgians. Extermination of the Jews enabled the Nazis to bring a practiced hand to similar measures against Poles, Serbs, and Greeks. The plight of the Jew was a constant threat to opposition or discontent among other elements of Europe's population pacifists, conservatives, Communists, Catholics, Protestants, Socialists. It was in fact, a threat to every dissenting opinion and to every non-Nazi's life.</P>

<P>The persecution policy against the Jews commenced with nonviolent measures such as disfranchisement and discriminations against their religion, and the placing of impediments in the way of success in economic life. It moved rapidly to organized mass violence against them, physical isolation in ghettos, deportation, labor mass starvation, and extermination. The Government, the party formations indicted before you as criminal organizations, the Secret State Police, the Army, private and semi-public associations, and "spontaneous" mobs that were carefully inspired from official sources, were all agencies that were concerned in this persecution. Nor was it directed against individual Jews for personal bad citizenship or unpopularity. The avowed purpose was the destruction of the Jewish people as a whole, as an end in itself, as a measure of preparation for war, and as a discipline of conquered peoples.</P>

<P>The conspiracy or common plan to exterminate the Jew was so methodically and thoroughly pursued, that despite the German defeat and Nazi prostration this Nazi aim largely has succeeded. Only remnants of the European Jewish population remain in Germany, in the countries which Germany occupied, and in those which were her satellites or collaborators. Of the 9.6 million Jews who lived in Nazi-dominated Europe, 60% are authoritatively estimated to have perished. 5.7 million Jews are missing from the countries in which they formerly lived, and over 4.5 million cannot be accounted for by the normal death rate nor by immigration; nor are they included among displaced persons. History does not record a crime ever perpetrated against so many victims or one ever carried out with such calculated cruelty.</P>

<P>You will have difficulty, as I have, to look into the faces of these defendants and believe that in this twentieth century human beings could inflict such sufferings as will be proved here on their own countrymen as well as upon their so-called "inferior" enemies. Particular crimes, and the responsibility of defendants for them, are to be dealt with by the Soviet Government's counsel, when committed in the East, and by counsel for the Republic of France when committed in the West. I advert to them only to show their magnitude as evidence of a purpose and a knowledge common to all defendants, of an official plan rather than of a capricious policy of some dual commander, and to show such a continuity of Jewish persecution from the rise of the Nazi conspiracy to its collapse as forbids us to believe that any person could be identified with any part of Nazi action without approving this most conspicuous item in their program.</P>

<P>The Indictment itself recites many evidences of the anti- Semitic persecutions. The Defendant Streicher led the Nazis in anti-Semitic bitterness and extremism. In an article appearing in Der Stuermer on 3/19/1942 he complained that Christian teachings have stood in the way of "racial solution of the Jewish question in Europe", and quoted enthusiastically as the twentieth century solution the Fuehrer's proclamation of 2/24/1942 that "the Jew will be exterminated." And on 11/4/1943 Streicher declared in Der Stuermer that the Jews "have disappeared from Europe and that the Jewish 'Reservoir of the East' from which the Jewish plague has for centuries beset the people of Europe, has ceased to exist." Streicher now has the effrontery to tell us he is "only a Zionist" he says he wants only to return the Jews to Palestine. But on 5/1942 his newspaper, Der Stuermer, had this to say:</P>

<P>"It is also not only a European problem! The Jewish question is a world question! Not only is Germany not safe in the face of the Jews as long as one Jew lives in Europe, but also the Jewish question is hardly solved in Europe so long as Jews live in the rest of the world."</P>

<P>And the Defendant Hans Frank, a lawyer by profession, I say with shame, summarized in his diary in 1944 the Nazi policy thus: "The Jews are a race which has to be eliminated, whenever we catch one, it is his end" (2233-PS, 3/4/1944, P. 26). And earlier speaking of his function as Governor General of Poland, he confided to his diary this sentiment: "Of course I cannot eliminate all lice and Jews in only a year's time" (2233- PS, Vol. IV, 1940, P. 1108). l could multiply endlessly this kind of Nazi ranting but I will leave it to the evidence and turn to the fruit of this perverted thinking.

<P>The most serious of the actions against Jews were outside of any law, but the law itself was employed to some extent. There were the infamous Nuremberg decrees of 9/15/1935 (Reichsgesetzblatt 1935, Part. I, P. 1146). The Jews were segregated into ghettos and put into forced labor; they. were expelled from their professions; their property was expropriated, all cultural life, the press, the theater. and schools were prohibited them; and the SD was made responsible for them (212-PS, 069-PS). This was an ominous guardianship, as the following order for "The Handling of the Jewish Question" shows:</P>

<P>"The competency of the Chief of the Security Police and Security Service, who is charged with the mission of solving the European Jewish question, extends even to the Occupied Eastern Provinces ....</P>

<P>"An eventual act by the civilian population against the Jews is not to be prevented as long as this is compatible with the maintenance of order and security in the rear of the fighting troops ....</P>

<P>"The first main goal of the German measures must be strict Segregation of Jewry from the rest of the population. In the execution of this, first of all is the seizing of the Jewish populace by the introduction of a registration order and similar appropriate measures ....</P>

<P>"Then immediately the wearing of the recognition sign consisting of a yellow Jewish star is to be brought about and all rights of freedom for Jews are to be withdrawn. They are to be placed in ghettos and at the same time are to be separated according to sexes. The presence of many more or less closed Jewish settlements in White Ruthenia and in the Ukraine makes this mission easier. Moreover, places are to be chosen which make possible the full use of the Jewish manpower in case labor needs are present ....</P>

<P>"The entire Jewish property is to be seized and confiscated with exception of that which is necessary for a bare existence. As far as the economical situation permits, the power of disposal of their property is to be taken from the Jews as soon as possible through orders and other measures given by the commissariat, so that the moving of property will quickly cease.</P>

<P>"Any cultural activity will be completely forbidden, to the Jew. This includes the outlawing of the Jewish press, the Jewish theaters, and schools.</P>

<P>"The slaughtering of animals according to Jewish rites is also to be prohibited ...." (212-PS)</P>

<P>The anti-Jewish campaign became furious in Germany following the assassination in Paris of the German Legation Councillor Von Rath. Heydrich, Gestapo head, sent a teletype to all Gestapo and SD offices with directions for handling "spontaneous" uprising anticipated for the nights of 11/9- 10/1938 so as to aid in destruction of Jewish-owned property and protect only that of Germans. No more cynical document ever came into evidence. Then there is a report by an SS brigade leader, Dr. Stahlecker, to Himmler, which recites that:</P>

<P>"... Similarly, native anti-Semitic forces were induced to start pogroms against Jews during the first hours after capture, though this inducement proved to be very difficult. Following out orders, the Security Police was determined to solve the Jewish question with all possible means and most decisively. But it was desirable that the Security Police should not put in an immediate appearance, at least in the beginning, since the extraordinarily harsh measures were apt to stir even German circles. It had to be shown to the world that the native population itself took the first action by way of natural reaction against the suppression by Jews during several decades and against the terror exercised by the Communists during the preceding period ...."</P>

<P>"... In view of the extension of the area of operations and the great number of duties which had to be performed by the Security Police, it was intended from the very beginning to obtain the co-operation of the reliable population for the fight against verminthat is mainly the Jews and Communists Beyond our directing of the first spontaneous actions of self- cleansing, which will be reported elsewhere, care had to be taken that reliable people should be put to the cleansing job and that they were appointed auxiliary members of the Security Police ...."</P>

<P>"... Kovno. To our surprise it was not easy at first to set in motion an extensive pogrom against Jews. Klimatis, the leader of the partisan unit, mentioned above, who was used for this purpose primarily, succeeded in starting a pogrom on the basis of advice given to him by a small advanced detachment acting in Kovno, and in such a way that no German order or German instigation was noticed from the outside. During the first pogrom in the night from 25 to 26 June the Lithuanian partisans did away with more than 1,500 Jews, set fire to several synagogues or destroyed them by other means and burned down a Jewish dwelling district consisting of about 60 houses. During the following nights about 2,300 Jews were made harmless in a similar way. In other parts of Lithuania similar actions followed the example of Kovno, though smaller and extending to the Communists who had been left behind.</P>

<P>"These self-cleansing actions went smoothly because the Army authorities who had been informed showed understanding for this procedure. From the beginning it was obvious that only the first days after the occupation would offer the opportunity for carrying out pogroms. After the disarmament of the partisans the self-cleansing actions ceased necessarily.</P>

<P>"It proved much more difficult to set in motion similar cleansing actions in Latvia...." (L-180)</P>

<P>Of course, it is self-evident that these "uprisings" were managed by the Government and the Nazi Party. If we were in doubt, we could resort to Streicher's memorandum of 4/14/1939 which says:</P>

<P>"The anti-Jewish action of 11/1938 did not arise spontaneously from the people.... Part of the Party formation been charged with the execution of the anti-Jewish action." (406-PS)</P>

<P>Jews as a whole were fined a billion Reichsmarks. They were excluded from all businesses, and claims against insurance companies for their burned properties were confiscated, all by decree of the Defendant Goering. (Reichsgesetzblatt, 1938, Part I, Pp. 1579-82)</P>

<P>Synagogues were the objects of a special vengeance. On 11/10/1938 the following order was given:</P>

<P>"By order of the Group Commander:</P>

<P>All Jewish synagogues in the area of Brigade 50 have to be blown up or set afire.... The operation will be carried out in civilian clothing .... Execution of the order will be reported...." (1721-PS)</P>

<P>Some 40 teletype messages from various police headquarters will tell the fury with which all Jews were pursued in Germany on those awful November nights. The SS troops were turned loose and the Gestapo supervised. Jewish-owned property was authorized to be destroyed. The Gestapo ordered twenty to thirty thousand "well-to-do-Jews" to be arrested. Concentration camps were to receive them. Healthy Jews, fit for labor, were to be taken. (3051-PS) [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>As the German frontiers were expanded by war, so the campaign against the Jews expanded. The Nazi plan never was limited to extermination in Germany; always it contemplated extinguishing the Jew in Europe and often in the world. In the West, the Jews were killed and their property taken over. But the campaign achieved its zenith of savagery in the East. The eastern Jew has suffered as no people ever suffered. Their sufferings were carefully reported to the Nazi authorities to show faithful adherence to the Nazi design. I shall refer only to enough of the evidence of these to show the extent of the Nazi design for killing Jews.</P>

<P>If I should recite these horrors in words of my own, you would think me intemperate and unreliable. Fortunately, we need not take the word of any witness but the Germans themselves. I invite you now to look at a few of the vast number of captured German orders and reports that will be offered in evidence, to see what a Nazi invasion meant. We will present such evidence as the report of Einsatzgruppe (Action Group) A" of 10/15/1941 which boasts that in overrunning the Baltic States, "Native anti-Semitic forces were induced to start pogroms against the Jews during the first hours after occupation ...." The report continues:</P>

<P>From the beginning it was to be expected that the Jewish problem in the East could not be solved by pogroms alone.</P>

<P>In accordance with the basic orders received, however, the cleansing activities of the Security Police had to aim at a complete annihilation of the Jews. Special detachments rein forced by selected unitsin Lithuania partisan detachments in Latvia units of the Latvian auxiliary policetherefore performed extensive executions both in the towns and in rural areas. The actions of the execution detachments were performed smoothly."</P>

<P>"The sum total of the Jews liquidated in Lithuania amounts to 71105. During the pogroms in Kovno 3800 Jews were eliminated, in the smaller towns about 1200 Jews." "In Latvia, up to now a total of 30000 Jews were executed. Five hundred were eliminated by pogroms in Riga." (L-180)</P>

<P>This is a captured report from the Commissioner of Sluzk on 10/30/1941 which describes the scene in more detail. It says:</P>

<P>" ... The first lieutenant explained that the police battalion had received the assignment to effect the liquidation of all Jews here in the town of Sluzk, within two days .... Then I requested him to postpone the action one day. However, he rejected this with the remark that he had to carry out this action everywhere and in all towns and that only two days were allotted for Sluzk. Within these two days, the town of Sluzk had to be cleared of Jews by all means.... All Jews without exception were taken out of the factories and shops and deported in spite of our agreement. It is true that part of the Jews was moved by way of the ghetto where many of them were processed and still segregated by me, but a large part was loaded directly on trucks and liquidated without further delay outside of the town .... For the rest, as regards the execution of the action, I must point out to my deepest regret that the latter bordered already on sadism The town itself offered a picture of horror during the action With indescribable brutality on the part of both the German police officers and particularly the Lithuanian partisans, the Jewish people, but also among them White Ruthenians, were taken out of their dwellings and herded together. Every where in the town shots were to be heard and in different streets the corpses of shot Jews accumulated. The White Ruthenians were in greatest distress to free themselves from the encirclement. Regardless of the fact that the Jewish people, among whom were also tradesmen, were mistreated in a terribly barbarous way in the face of the White Ruthenian people, the White Ruthenians themselves were also worked over with rubber clubs and rifle butts. There was no question of an action against the Jews any more. It rather looked like a revolution ....</P>

<P>There are reports which merely tabulate the numbers slaughtered. An example is an account of the work of Einsatzgruppen of SIPO and SD in the East, which relates that:</P>

<P>In Estonia all Jews were arrested immediately upon the arrival the Wehrmacht. Jewish men and women above the age of 16 and capable of work were drafted for forced labor. Jews were subjected to all sorts of restrictions and all Jewish property was confiscated. All Jewish males above the age of 16 were executed, with the exception of doctors and elders. Only 500 of an original 4,500 Jews remained. Thirty-seven thousand, one hundred eighty persons have been liquidated by the SIPO and SD in White Ruthenia during october. In one town, 337 Jewish women were executed for demonstrating a 'provocative attitude.' In another, 380 Jews were shot for spreading vicious propaganda.</P>

<P>And so the report continues, listing town after town, where hundreds of Jews were murdered:</P>

<P>In Vitebsk 3000 Jews were liquidated because of the danger of epidemics. In Kiev 33771 Jews were executed on September 29 and 30 in retaliation for some fires which were set off there. In Shitomir 3145 Jews 'had to be shot' because, judging from experience they had to be considered as the carriers of Bolshevik propaganda. In Cherson 410 Jews were executed in reprisal against acts of sabotage; In the territory east of the Dnieper, the Jewish problem was 'solved' by the liquidation of 4891 Jews and by putting the remainder into labor battalions of up to 1000 persons. (R-102)</P>

<P>Other accounts tell not of the slaughter so much as of the depths of degradation to which the tormentors stooped. For example, we will show the report made to Defendant Rosenberg about the army and the SS in the area under Rosenberg's jurisdiction, which recited the following:</P>

<P>"Details: In presence of SS man, a Jewish dentist has to break all gold teeth and fillings out of mouth of German and Russian Jews before they are executed."</P>

<P>Men, women and children are locked into barns and burned alive.</P>

<P>Peasants, women and children are shot on the pretext that they are suspected of belonging to bands. (R-135)</P>

<P>We of the Western World heard of gas wagons in which Jews and political opponents were asphyxiated. We could not believe it, but here we have the report of 5/16/1942 from the German SS officer Becker to his supervisor in Berlin which tells this story:</P>

<P>Gas vans in C group can be driven to execution spot, which is generally stationed 10 to 15 kms. from main road, only in dry weather. Since those to be executed become frantic if conducted to this place, such vans become immobilized in wet weather.</P>

<P>Gas vans in D group were camouflaged as cabin trailers, but vehicles well known to authorities and civilian population which calls them 'death vans'.</P>

<P>Writer of letter (Becker) ordered all men to keep as far a as possible during gassing. Unloading van has 'atrocious spiritual and physical effect' on men and they should be ordered not to participate in such work. (501-PS) [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>I shall not dwell on this subject longer than to quote one more sickening document which evidences the planned and systematic character of the Jewish persecutions. I hold a report written with Teutonic devotion to detail, illustrated with photographs to authenticate its almost incredible text, and beautifully bound in leather with the loving care bestowed on a proud work. It is the original report of the SS Brigadier General Stroop in charge of the destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto, and its title page carries the inscription "The Jewish ghetto in Warsaw no longer exists." It is characteristic that one of the captions explains that the photograph concerned shows the driving out of Jewish "bandits"; those whom the photograph shows being driven out are almost entirely women and little children. It contains a day-by-day account of the killings mainly carried out by the SS organization, too long to relate, but let me quote General Stroop's summary:</P>

<P>"The resistance put up by the Jews and bandits could only be suppressed by energetic actions of our troops day and night. The Reichsfuehrer SS ordered, therefore, on 4/23/1943, the cleaning out of the ghetto with utter ruthlessness and merciless tenacity. I, therefore, decided to destroy and burn down the entire ghetto without regard to the armament factories. These factories were systematically dismantled and then burned. Jews usually left their hideouts, but frequently remained in the burning buildings and jumped out of the windows only when the heat became unbearable. They then tried to crawl with broken bones across the street into buildings which were not afire. Sometimes they changed their hideouts during the night into the ruins of burned buildings. Life in the sewers was not pleasant after the first week. Many times we could hear loud voices in the sewers. SS men or policemen climbed bravely through the manholes to capture these Jews. Sometimes they stumbled over Jewish corpses: sometimes they were shot at. Tear gas bombs were thrown into the manholes and the Jews driven out of the sewers and captured. Countless numbers of Jews were liquidated in sewers and bunkers through blasting. The longer the resistance continued the tougher became the members of the Waffen SS, Police and Wehrmacht who always discharged their duties in an exemplary manner. Frequently Jews who tied to replenish their food supplies during the night or to communicate with neighboring groups were exterminated.</P>

<P>"This action eliminated," says the SS commander, "a proved total of 56,065. To that, we have to add the number killed through blasting, fire, etc., which cannot be counted." (1061- PS)</P>

<P>We charge that all atrocities against Jews were the manifestation and culmination of the Nazi plan to which every defendant here was a party. I know very well that some of these men did take step to spare some particular Jew for some personal reason from the horrors that awaited the unrescued Jew. Some protested that particular atrocities were excessive, and discredited the general policy. While a few defendants may show efforts to make specific exceptions to the policy of Jewish extermination, I have found no instance in which any defendant opposed the policy itself or sought to revoke or even modify it.</P>

<P>Determination to destroy the Jews was a binding force which at all times cemented the elements of this conspiracy. On many internal policies there were differences among the defendants. But there is not one of them who has not echoed the rallying cry of nazism: 'Deutschland erwache, Juda verrecke!" (Germany awake, Jewry perish!).</P>

<P>Terrorism and Preparation for War:</P>

<P>How a government treats its own inhabitants generally is thought to be no concern of other governments or of international society. Certainly few oppressions or cruelties would warrant the intervention of foreign powers. But the German mistreatment of Germans is now known to pass in magnitude and savagery any limits of what is tolerable by modern civilization. Other nations, by silence, would take a consenting part in such crimes. These Nazi persecutions, moreover, take character as international crimes because of the purpose for which they were undertaken.</P>

<P>The purpose as we have seen, of getting rid of the influence of free labor, the churches, and the Jews was to clear their obstruction the precipitation of aggressive war. If aggressive warfare in violation of treaty obligation is a matter of international cognizance the preparations for it must also be of concern to the international Terrorism was the chief instrument for securing the cohesion of the German people in war purposes. Moreover, the cruelties in Germany served as atrocity practice to discipline the membership of the criminal organization to follow the pattern later in occupied countries.</P>

<P>Through the police formations that are before you accused criminal organizations, the Nazi Party leaders, aided at some point in their basic and notorious purpose by each of the individual defendants, instituted a reign of terror. These espionage and police organizations were utilized to hunt down every form of opposition and to penalize every nonconformity. These organizations early founded and administered concentration campsBuchenwald in 1933, Dachau in 1934. But these notorious names were not alone. Concentration camps came to dot the German map and to number scores. At first they met with resistance from some Germans. We have a captured letter from Minister of Justice Guertner to Hitler which is revealing. A Gestapo official had been prosecuted for crimes committed in the camp at Hohnstein, and the Nazi Governor of Saxony had promptly asked that the proceeding be quashed. The Minister of Justice in 6/1935 protested because, as he said "In this camp unusually grave mistreatments of prisoners have occurred at least since summer 1933. The prisoners not only were beaten with whips without cause, similarly as in the Concentration Camp Bredow near Stettin till they lost consciousness, but they were also tortured in other manners, e.g. with the help of a dripping apparatus constructed exclusively for this purpose, under which prisoners had to stand until they were suffering from serious purulent wounds of the scalp ...." (787-PS)</P>

<P>I shall not take time to detail the ghastly proceedings in these concentration camps. Beatings, starvings, tortures, and killings were routine so routine that the tormenters became blase and careless. We have a report of discovery that in Ploetzensee one night, 186 persons were executed while there were orders for only 180. Another report describes how the family of one victim received two urns of ashes by mistake.</P>

<P>Inmates were compelled to execute each other. In 1942 they were paid five Reichsmarks per execution, but on 6/27/1942 SS General Gluecks ordered commandants of an concentration camps to reduce this honorarium to three cigarettes. In 1943 the Reich leader of the SS and Chief of German Police ordered the corporal punishments on Russian women to be applied by Polish women and vice versa, but the price was not frozen. He said that as reward, a few cigarettes was authorized. Under the Nazis human life had been progressively devalued, until it finally became worth less than a handful of tobaccoersatz tobacco. There were, however, some traces of the milk of human kindness. On August 2 an order went from Himmler to the commanders of 14 concentration camps that only German prisoners are allowed to beat other German prisoners (2189- PS). [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>Mystery and suspense was added to cruelty in order to spread torture from the inmate to his family and friends. Men and women disappeared from their homes or business or from the streets and no word came of them. The omission of notice was not due to overworked staff; it was due to policy. The Chief of the SD and SIPO reported that in accordance with orders from the Fuehrer anxiety should be created in the minds of the family of the arrested person. (668-PS) Deportations and secret arrests were labeled, with a Nazi wit which seems a little ghoulish, "Nacht und Nebel," (Night and Fog) (L-90, 833-PS). One of the many orders for these actions gave this explanation:</P>

<P>"The decree carries a basic innovation. The Fuehrer and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces commands that crimes of the specified sort committed by civilians of the occupied territories are to be punished by the pertinent courts- martial in the occupied territories only when (a) the sentence calls for the death penalty, and (b) the sentence is pronounced within eight days after the arrest.</P>

<P>"Only when both conditions are met does the Fuehrer and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces hope for the desired deterrent effect from the conduct of punitive proceedings in the occupied territories.</P>

<P>"In other cases, in the future, the accused are to be secretly brought to Germany, and the further conduct of the trial carried on here. The deterrent effect of these measures lies (a) in allowing the disappearance of the accused without a trace, (b) therein that no information whatsoever may be given about their whereabouts and their fate." (833-PS)</P>

<P>To clumsy cruelty, scientific skill was added. "Undesirables" Were exterminated by injection of drugs into the bloodstream, by asphyxiation in gas chambers. They were shot with poison bullets, to study the effects. (L-103)</P>

<P>Then, to cruel experiments the Nazi added obscene ones. These were not the work of underling-degenerates but of master- minds high in the Nazi conspiracy. On 5/20/1942 General Field Marshal Milch authorized SS General Wolff to go ahead at Dachau Camp with so-called "cold experiments"; and four female gypsies were supplied for the purpose. Himmler gave permission to carry on these "experiments" also in other camps. (1617-PS) At Dachau, the reports of the "doctor" in charge show that victims immersed in cold water until their body temperature was reduced to 28C (82.4 degrees Fahrenheit), when they died immediately (1618-PS). This was in 8/1942. But the "doctor's" technique improved. By 2/1943 he was able report that 30 persons were chilled to 27-29 degrees, their hand and feet frozen white, and their bodies "rewarmed" by a hot bath. But the Nazi scientific triumph was "rewarming with animal heat." The victim, all but frozen to death, was surrounded with bodies of living women until he revived and responded to his environment by having sexual intercourse. (1616-PS) Here Nazi degeneracy reached its nadir.</P>

<P>I dislike to encumber the record with such morbid tales, but we are in the grim business of trying men as criminals, and these are the things that their own agents say happened. We will show you these concentration camps in motion pictures, just as the Allied armies found them when they arrived, and the measures Genera Eisenhower had to take to clean them up. Our proof will be disgusting and you will say I have robbed you of your sleep. But these are the things which have turned the stomach of the world and set every civilized hand against Nazi Germany.</P>

<P>Germany became one vast torture chamber. Cries of its victims were heard round the world and brought shudders to civilized people everywhere. I am one who received during this war most atrocity tales with suspicion and scepticism. But the proof here will be so overwhelming that I venture to predict not one word I have spoken will be denied. These defendants will only deny personal responsibility or knowledge.</P>

<P>Under the clutch of the most intricate web of espionage and intrigue that any modern state has endured, and persecution and torture of a kind that has not been visited upon the world in man centuries, the elements of the German population which were both decent and courageous were annihilated. Those which were decent but weak were intimidated. Open resistance, which had never been more than feeble and irresolute, disappeared. But resistance, I am happy to say, always remained, although it was manifest in only such events as the abortive effort to assassinate Hitler on 7/20/1944. With resistance driven underground, the Nazi had the German State in his own hands.</P>

<P>But the Nazis not only silenced discordant voices. They created positive controls as effective as their negative ones. Propaganda organs, on a scale never before known, stimulated the Party and Party formations with a permanent enthusiasm and abandon such as we, democratic people, can work up only for a few days before a general election. They inculcated and practiced the Fuehrer which centralized control of the Party and of the Party-controlled state over the lives and thought of the German people, who are accustomed to look upon the German State, by whomever controlled, with a mysticism that is incomprehensible to my people.</P>

<P>All these controls from their inception were exerted with unparalleled energy and single-mindedness to put Germany on a war footing. We will show from the Nazis' own documents their secret training of military personnel, their secret creation of a military air force. Finally, a conscript army was brought into being. Financiers, economists, industrialists joined in the plan and promoted elaborate alterations in industry and finance to support an unprecedented concentration of resources and energies upon preparations for war. Germany's rearmament so outstripped the strength of her neighbors that in about a year she was able to crush the whole military force of continental Europe, exclusive of that of Soviet Russia, and then to push the Russian armies back to the Volga. These preparations were of a magnitude which surpassed all need of defense, and every defendant, and every intelligent German, well understood them to be for aggressive purposes. [=]</P>

<P>Experiments in Aggression:</P>

<P>Before resorting to open aggressive warfare, the Nazis undertook some rather cautious experiments to test the spirit of resistance of those who lay across their path. They advanced, but only as others yielded, and kept in a position to draw back if they found a temperament that made persistence dangerous.</P>

<P>On 3/7/1936 the Nazis reoccupied the Rhineland and then proceeded to fortify it in violation of the Treaty of Versailles and the Pact of Locarno. They encountered no substantial resistance and were emboldened to take the next step, which was the acquisition of Austria. Despite repeated assurances that Germany had no designs on Austria, invasion was perfected. Threat of attack forced Schuschnigg to resign as Chancellor of Austria and put the Nazi Defendant Seyss- Inquart in his place. The latter immediately opened the frontier and invited Hitler to invade Austria "to preserve order". On March 12th invasion began. The next day, Hitler proclaimed himself Chief of the Austrian State, took command of its armed forces, and a law was enacted annexing Austria to Germany.</P>

<P>Threats of aggression had succeeded without arousing resistance. Fears nevertheless had been stirred. They were lulled by an assurance to the Czechoslovak Government that there would be no attack on that country. We will show that the Nazi Government already had detailed plans for the attack. We will lay before you the documents in which these conspirators planned to create incident to justify their attack. They even gave consideration to assassinating their own Ambassador at Prague in order to create a sufficiently dramatic incident. They did precipitate a diplomatic crisis which endured throughout the summer. Hitler set September 30th as the day when troops should be ready for action. Under the threat of immediate war, the United Kingdom and France concluded a pact with Germany and Italy at Munich on 9/29/1938 which required Czechoslovakia to acquiesce in the cession of the Sudetenland to Germany. It was consummated by German occupation on 10/1/1938.</P>

<P>The Munich Pact pledged no further aggression against Czechoslovakia, but the Nazi pledge was lightly given and quickly broken. On the 3/15/1939, in defiance of the treaty of Munich itself, the Nazis seized and occupied Bohemia and Moravia, which constituted the major part of Czechoslovakia not already ceded to Germany. Once again the West stood aghast, but it dreaded war it saw no remedy except war, and it hoped against hope that the Nazi fever for expansion had run its course. But the Nazi world was intoxicated by these unresisted successes in open alliance with Mussolini and in covert alliance with Franco. Then, having made a deceitful, delaying peace with Russia, the conspirators entered upon the final phase of the plan to renew war.</P>

<P>War of Aggression:</P>

<P>I will not prolong this address by detailing the steps leading to the war of aggression which began with the invasion of Poland on 9/1/1939. The further story will be unfolded to you from documents including those of the German High Command itself.</P>

<P>The plans had been laid long in advance. As early as 1935 Hitler appointed the Defendant Schacht to the position of General Deputy for the War Economy (2261-PS). We have the diary of General Jodl (1780-PS); the "Plan Otto," Hitler's own order for attack on Austria in case trickery failed (C-102); the "Plan Green" which was the blueprint for attack on Czechoslovakia (388-PS); plans for the war in the West (375- PS, 376-PS); Funk's letter to Hitler dated 8/25/1939 detailing the long course of economic preparation (699-PS); Keitel's top-secret mobilization order for 1939-1940 prescribing secret steps to be taken during a "period of tension" during which no "'state of war' will be publicly declared even if open war measures against the foreign enemy will be taken." This letter order (1639A-PS) is in our possession despite a secret order issued On 3/16/1945, when Allied troops were advancing into the heart of Germany, to burn these plans. We have also Hitler's directive, dated 12/18/1940, for the "Barbarossa Contingency" outlining the strategy of the attack upon Russia (446-PS). That plan in the original bears the initials of the Defendants Keitel and Jodl. They were planning the attack and planning it long in advance of the declaration of war. We have detailed information concerning "Case White," the plan for attack on Poland (C-120). That attack began the war. The plan was issued by Keitel on 4/3/1939. The attack did not come until September. Steps in preparation for the attack were taken by subordinate commanders, one of whom issued an order on June 14, providing that:</P>

<P>"The Commander-in-Chief of the Army has ordered the working out of a plan of deployment against Poland which takes in account the demands of the political leadership for the opening of war by surprise and for quick success....</P>

<P>"I declare it the duty of the commanding generals, the divisional commanders, and the commandants to limit as much as possible the number of persons who will be informed, and to limit the extent of the information, and ask at all suitable measures be taken to prevent persons not concerned from getting information....</P>

<P>"The operation, in order to forestall an orderly Polish mobilization and concentration, is to be opened by surprise with forces which are for the most part armored and motorized, placed on alert in the neighborhood of the border. The initial superiority over the Polish frontier guards and surprise that can be expected with certainty are to be maintained by quickly bringing up other parts of the Army as well to counteract the marching up of the Polish Army....</P>

<P>"If the development of the political situation should show that a surprise at the beginning of the war is out of question, because of well-advanced defense preparations on the part of the Polish Army, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army will order the opening of the hostilities only after the assembling of sufficient additional forces. The basis of all preparations will be to surprise the enemy...." (2327-PS) [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>We have also the order for the invasion of England, signed by Hitler and initialed by Keitel and Jodl. It is interesting that it commences with a recognition that although the British military position is "hopeless," they show not the slightest sign of giving in. (442-PS)</P>

<P>Not the least incriminating are the minutes of Hitler's meeting with his high advisers. As early as 11/5/1937 Hitler told Defendants Goering, Raeder, and Neurath, among others, that German rearmament was practically accomplished and that he had decided to secure by force, starting with a lightning attack Czechoslovakia and Austria, greater living space for German Europe no later than 1943-1945 and perhaps as early as 1938 (386-PS). On the 5/23/1939 the Fuehrer advised his staff that:</P>

<P>"It is a question of expanding our living space in the East and of securing our food supplies.... Over and above the natural fertility, thorough-going German exploitation will enormously increase the surplus.</P>

<P>"There is therefore no question of sparing Poland, and we are left with the decision: To attack Poland at the first suitable opportunity. We cannot expect a repetition of the Czech affair. There will be war." (L-79)</P>

<P>On 8/22/1939 Hitler again addressed members of the High Command, telling them when the start of military operations would be ordered. He disclosed that for propaganda purposes, he would provocate a good reason. "It will make no difference," he announced, "whether this reason will sound convincing or not. After all, the victor will not be asked whether he talked the truth or not. We have to proceed brutally. The stronger is always right." (1014-PS) On 11/23/1939, after the Germans had invaded Poland, Hitler made this explanation:</P>

<P>". . . For the first time in history we have to fight on only one front, the other front is at present free. But no one can know how long that will remain so. I have doubted for a long time whether I should strike in the East and then in the West. Basically I did not organize the armed forces in order not to strike. The decision to strike was always in me. Earlier or later I wanted to solve the problem. Under pressure it was decided that the East was to be attacked first ...."</P>

<P>We know the bloody sequel. Frontier incidents were staged. Demands were made for cession of territory. When Poland refused, the German forces invaded on 9/1/1939. Warsaw was destroyed; Poland fell. The Nazis, in accordance with plan, moved swiftly to extend their aggression throughout Europe and to gain the advantage of surprise over their unprepared neighbors. Despite repeated and solemn assurances of peaceful intentions, they invaded Denmark and Norway on 4/9/1940; Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg on 5/10/1940; Yugoslavia and Greece on 4/6/1941.</P>

<P>As part of the Nazi preparation for aggression against Poland and her allies, Germany, on 8/23/1939, had entered into a non- aggression pact with Soviet Russia. It was only a delaying treaty intended to be kept no longer than necessary to prepare for its violation. On 6/22/1941, pursuant to long-matured plans, the Nazis hurled troops into Soviet territory without any declaration of war. The entire European world was aflame.</P>

<P>Conspiracy with Japan:</P>

<P>The Nazi plans of aggression called for use of Asiatic allies and they found among the Japanese men of kindred mind and purpose. They were brothers, under the skin.</P>

<P>Himmler records a conversation he had on 1/31/1939 with General Oshima, Japanese Ambassador at Berlin. He wrote:</P>

<P>"Furthermore he (Oshima) had succeeded up to now to send 10 Russians with bombs across the Caucasian frontier. These Russians had the mission to kill Stalin. A number of additional Russians, whom he had also sent across, had been shot at the frontier." (2195-PS)</P>

<P>On 9/27/1940 the Nazis concluded a German-Italian-Japanese 10-year military and economic alliance by which those powers agreed "to stand by and cooperate with one another in regard to their efforts in Greater East Asia and regions of Europe respectively wherein it is their prime purpose to establish and maintain a new order of things."</P>

<P>On 3/5/1941 a top-secret directive was issued by Defendant Keitel. It stated that the Fuehrer had ordered instigation of Japan's active participation in the war and directed that Japan's military power has to be strengthened by the disclosure of German war experiences and support of a military, economic, and technical nature has to be given. The aim was stated to be to crush England quickly thereby keeping the United States out of the war. (C-75)</P>

<P>On 3/29/1941 Ribbentrop told Matsuoka, the Japanese Foreign Minister, that the German Army was ready to strike against Russia. Matsuoka reassured Ribbentrop about the Far East. Japan, he reported, was acting at the moment as though she had no interest whatever in Singapore, but intends to strike when the right moment comes. (1877-PS)</P>

<P>On 4/5/1941 Ribbentrop urged Matsuoka that entry of Japan into the war would "hasten the victory" and would be more in the interest of Japan than of Germany since it would give Japan a unique chance to fulfill her national aims and to play a leading part in Eastern Asia (1882-PS).</P>

<P>The proofs in this case will also show that the leaders of Germany were planning war against the United States from its Atlantic as well as instigating it from its Pacific approaches. A captured memorandum from the Fuehrer's headquarters, dated 10/29/1940, asks certain information as to air bases and supply and reports further that:</P>

<P>"The Fuehrer is at present occupied with the question of the occupation of the Atlantic islands with a view to the prosecution of war against America at a later date. Deliberations on this subject are being embarked upon here." (376-PS)</P>

<P>On 12/7/1941, a day which the late President Roosevelt declared "will live in infamy," victory for German aggression seemed certain. The Wehrmacht was at the gates of Moscow. Taking advantage of the situation, and while her plenipotentiaries were creating a diplomatic diversion in Washington, Japan without declaration of war treacherously attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor and the Philippines. Attacks followed swiftly on the British Commonwealth, and The Netherlands in the Southwest Pacific. These aggressions were met in the only way that they could be met, with instant declarations of war and with armed resistance which mounted slowly through many long months of reverse until finally the Axis was crushed to earth and deliverance for its victims was won.</P>

<P>Your Honor, I am about to take up "Crimes in the Conduct of War", which is quite a separate subject. We are within 5 minutes of the recessing time. It will be very convenient for me if it will be agreeable to you.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: We will sit again in 15 minutes' time.</P>

<P>[The Tribunal recessed until 1550 hours.] [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal must request that if it adjourns for 15 minutes members of the bar and others are back in their seats after an interval of 15 minutes. Mr. Justice Jackson, I understand that you wish to continue to 5:15, when you may be able to conclude your speech?</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I think that would be the most orderly way.</P>

<P>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, the Tribunal will be glad to do so.</P>

<P>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: May it please your Honor, I will now take up the subject of "Crimes in the Conduct of War".</P>

<P>Even the most warlike of peoples have recognized in the name of humanity some limitations on the savagery of warfare. Rules to that end have been embodied in international conventions to which Germany became a party. This code had prescribed certain restraints as to the treatment of belligerents. The enemy was entitled to surrender and to receive quarter and good treatment as a prisoner of war. We will show by German documents that these rights were denied, that prisoners of war were given brutal treatment and often murdered. This was particularly true in the case of captured airmen, often my countrymen.</P>

<P>It was ordered that captured English and American airmen should no longer be granted the status of prisoners of war. They were to be treated as criminals and the Army was ordered to refrain from protecting them against lynching by the populace. (R-118) The Nazi Government, through its police and propaganda agencies, took pains to incite the civilian population to attack and kill airmen who crash-landed. The order, given by the Reichsfuehrer Himmler on 8/10/1943, directed that: "It is not the task of the police to interfere in clashes between German and English and American flyers who have bailed out". This order was transmitted on the same day by SS Obersturmbannfuehrer Brand [Errata note: Volume II, Page 137, Line 14, change "Brand" to "Brandt" (Himmler's adjutant, Rudolf Brandt)] of Himmler's personal staff to all senior executive SS and Police officers, with these directions:</P>

<P>"I am sending you the inclosed order with the request that the Chief of the Regular Police and of the Security Police be informed. They are to make this instruction known to their subordinate officers verbally." (R-110)</P>

<P>Similarly, we will show Hitler's top secret order, dated 10/18/1942, that commandos, regardless of condition, were "to be slaughtered to the last man" after capture (498-PS). We will how the circulation of secret orders, one of which was signed by Hess, to be passed orally to civilians, that enemy fliers or parachutists were to be arrested or liquidated (062-PS). By such means were murders incited and directed.</P>

<P>This Nazi campaign of ruthless treatment of enemy forces assumed its greatest proportions in the fight against Russia. Eventually all prisoners of war were taken out of control of the Army and put in the hands of Himmler and the SS (058-PS). In the East, the German fury spent itself. Russian prisoners were ordered to be branded. They were starved. I shall quote passages from a letter written 2/28/1942 by Defendant Rosenberg to Defendant Keitel:</P>

<P>The fate of the Soviet prisoners of war in Germany is on the contrary a tragedy of the greatest extent. Of 3.6 million prisoners of war, only several hundred thousand are still able to work fully. A large part of them has starved, or died, because of the hazards of the weather. Thousands also died from spotted fever....</P>

<P>The camp commanders have forbidden the civilian population to put food at the disposal of the prisoners, and they have rather let them starve to death....</P>

<P>"In many cases, when prisoners of war could no longer keep up on the march because of hunger and exhaustion, the were shot before the eyes of the horrified population, and the corpses were left. "In numerous camps, no shelter for the prisoners of war was provided at all. They lay under the open sky during rain or snow. Even tools were not made available to dig holes or caves....</P>

<P>"Finally, the shooting of prisoners of war must be mentioned for instance, in various camps, all the 'Asiatics' were shot". (081-PS)</P>

<P>Civilized usage and conventions to which Germany was a party had prescribed certain immunities for civilian populations un fortunate enough to dwell in lands overrun by hostile armies. The German occupation forces, controlled or commanded by men on trial before you, committed a long series of outrages against the inhabitants of occupied territory that would be incredible except for captured orders and captured reports which show the fidelity with which those orders were executed.</P>

<P>We deal here with a phase of common criminality designed by the conspirators as part of the common plan. We can appreciate why these crimes against their European enemies were not of a casual character but were planned and disciplined crimes when we get at the reason for them. Hitler told his officers on 8/22/1939 that: "The main objective in Poland is the destruction of the enemy and not the reaching of a certain geographical line" (1014-PS). The project of deporting promising youth from occupied territories was approved by Rosenberg on the theory that "a desired weakening of the biological force" of the conquered people is being achieved (031-PS). To Germanize or to destroy was the program Himmler announced, "Either we win over any good blood that we can use for ourselves and give it a place in our people or, gentlemen you may call this cruel, but nature is cruel,we destroy this blood." As to "racially good types" Himmler further advised "Therefore, I think that it is our duty to take their children with us, to remove them from their environment, if necessary by robbing or stealing them" (L-70). He urged deportation of Slavic children to deprive potential enemies of future soldiers.</P>

<P>The Nazi purpose was to leave Germany's neighbors so weakened that even if she should eventually lose the war, she would still be the most powerful nation in Europe. Against this background, we must view the plan for ruthless warfare, which means a plan for the commission of War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity.</P>

<P>Hostages in large numbers were demanded and killed. Mass punishments were inflicted, so savage that whole communities were extinguished. Rosenberg was advised of the annihilation of three unidentified villages in Slovakia. (970-PS) In 5/1943 another village of about 40 farms and 220 inhabitants was ordered wiped out. The entire population was ordered shot, the cattle and property impounded, and the order required that "the village will be destroyed totally by fire." (163-PS) A secret report from Rosenberg's Reich Ministry of Eastern Territory reveals that:</P>

<P>"Food rations allowed the Russian population are so low that they fail to secure their existence and provide only for minimum subsistence of limited duration. The population does not know if they will still live tomorrow. They are faced with death by starvation....</P>

<P>"The roads are clogged by hundreds of thousands of people, sometimes as many as one million according to the estimate of experts, who wander around in search of nourishment....</P>

<P>"Sauckel's action has caused unrest among the civilians.... Russian girls were deloused by men, nude photos in forced positions were taken, women doctors were locked into freight cars for the pleasure of the transport commanders, women in night shirts were fettered and forced through the Russian towns to the railroad station, etc. All this material has been sent to the OKH." (1381-PS) [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>Perhaps the deportation to slave labor was the most horrible and extensive slaving operation in history. On few other subjects is our evidence so abundant or so damaging. In a speech made on 1/25/1944 the Defendant Frank, Governor General of Poland, boasted, "I have sent 1.3 million Polish workers into the Reich (05-PS, P. 2). The Defendant Sauckel reported that "out of the 5 million foreign workers who arrived in Germany not even 200000 came voluntarily." This fact was reported to the Fuehrer and Defendants Speer, Goering, and Keitel. (R-24) Children of 10-14 years were impressed into service by telegraphic order of Rosenberg's Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories:</P>

<P>"The Command is further charged with the transferring of worthwhile Russian youth between 10-14 years of age, to the Reich. The authority is not affected by the changes connected with the evacuation and transportation to the reception camps of Bialystok Krajewo, and Olitei. The Fuehrer wishes that this activity be increased even more." (200-PS)</P>

<P>When enough labor was not forthcoming, prisoners of war were forced into war work in flagrant violation of international conventions (016-PS) Slave labor came from France, Belgium Holland, Italy, and the East. Methods of recruitment were violent (R-124, 018-PS, 204-PS). The treatment of these slave laborers was stated in general terms, not difficult to translate into concrete deprivations, in a letter to the Defendant Rosenberg from the Defendant Sauckel, which stated:</P>

<P>"All prisoners of war, from the territories of the West as well as of the East, actually in Germany, must be completely incorporated into the German armament and munition industries Their production must be brought to the highest possible level....</P>

<P>"The complete employment of all prisoners of war as well as the use of a gigantic number of new foreign civilian workers, men and women, has become an indisputable necessity for the solution of the mobilization of labor program in this war.</P>

<P>"All the men must be fed, sheltered, and treated in such a way as to exploit them to the highest possible extent at the lowest conceivable degrees of expenditure...." (016-PS)</P>

<P>In pursuance of the Nazi plan permanently to reduce the living standards of their neighbors and to weaken them physically and economically, a long series of crimes were committed. There was extensive destruction, serving no military purpose, of the property of civilians. Dikes were thrown open in Holland almost at the close of the war not to achieve military ends but to destroy the resources and retard the economy of the thrifty Netherlanders.</P>

<P>There was carefully planned economic syphoning off of the assets of occupied countries. An example of the planning is shown by a report on France dated 12/7/1942 made by the Economic Research Department of the Reichsbank. The question arose whether French occupation costs should be increased from RM15 million per day to RM25 million per day. The Reichsbank analyzed French economy to determine whether it could bear the burden. It pointed out that the armistice had burdened France to that date to the extent of RM18.5 billion, equalling F370 billion. It pointed out that the burden of these payments within 2 1/2 years equalled the aggregate French national income in the year 1940, and that the amount of payments handed over to Germany in the first 6 months of 1942 corresponded to the estimate for the total French revenue for that whole year. The report concluded:</P>

<P>"In any case, the conclusion is inescapable that relatively heavier tributes have been imposed on France since the armistice in 6/1940 than upon Germany after the World War. In this connection, it must be noted that the economic powers of France never equalled those of the German Reich and that the vanquished France could not draw on foreign economic and financial resources in the same degree as Germany after the last World War."</P>

<P>The Defendant Funk was the Reich Minister of Economics and President of the Reichsbank; Defendant Ribbentrop was Foreign Minister; the Defendant Goering was Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan; and all of them participated in the exchange of views of which this captured document is a part. (2149-PS) Notwithstanding this analysis by the Reichsbank, they proceeded to ease the imposition on France from RM15 million to RM25 million per day.</P>

<P>It is small wonder that the bottom has been knocked out of French economy. The plan and purpose of the thing appears in a letter from General Stuelpnagel, head of the German Armistice Commission, to the Defendant Jodl as early as 9/14/1940 when he wrote, "The slogan 'Systematic weakening of France' has already been surpassed by far in reality" (1756- PS).</P>

<P>Not only was there a purpose to debilitate and demoralize the economy of Germany's neighbors for the purpose of destroying their competitive position, but there was looting and pilfering on an unprecedented scale. We need not be hypocritical about this business of looting. I recognize that no army moves through occupied territory without some pilfering as it goes. Usually the amount of pilfering increases as discipline wanes. If the evidence in this case showed no looting except of that sort, I certainly would ask no conviction of these defendants for it.</P>

<P>But we will show you that looting was not due to the lack of discipline or to the ordinary weaknesses of human nature. The German organized plundering, planned it, disciplined it, and made it official just as he organized everything else, and then he compiled the most meticulous records to show that he had done the best job of looting that was possible under the circumstances. And we have those records.</P>

<P>The Defendant Rosenberg was put in charge of a systematic plundering of the art objects of Europe by direct order of Hitler dated 1/29/1940 (136-PS). On the 4/16/1943 Rosenberg reported that up to the 7th of April, 92 railway cars with 2775 cases containing art objects had been sent to Germany; and that 53 pieces of art had been shipped to Hitler direct, and 594 to the Defendant Goering. The report mentioned something like 20000 pieces of seized art and the main locations where they were stored. (015-PS)</P>

<P>Moreover this looting was glorified by Rosenberg. Here we have 39 leather-bound tabulated volumes of his inventory, which in due time we will offer in evidence. One cannot but admire the artistry of this Rosenberg report. The Nazi taste was cosmopolitan. Of the 9455 articles inventoried, there were included 5255 paintings 297 sculptures, 1372 pieces of antique furniture, 307 textiles, and 2224 small objects of art. Rosenberg observed that there were approximately 10000 more objects still to be inventoried. (015-PS) Rosenberg himself estimated that the values involved would cone close to a billion dollars (090-PS).</P>

<P>I shall not go into further details of the War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity committed by the gangster ring whose leaders are before you. It is not the purpose in my part of this case to deal with the individual crimes. I am dealing with the Common Plan or design for crime and will not dwell upon individual offenses. My task is to show the scale on which these crimes occurred and to show that these are the men who were in the responsible positions and who conceived the plan and design which renders them answerable, regardless of the fact that the plan was actually executed by others.</P>

<P>At length, this reckless and lawless course outraged the world. It recovered from the demoralization of surprise attack, assembled its forces and stopped these men in their tracks. Once success deserted their banners, one by one the Nazi satellites fell away. Sawdust Caesar collapsed. Resistance forces in every occupied country arose to harry the invader. Even at home, Germans saw that Germany was being led to ruin by these mad men, and the attempt on 7/20/1944 to assassinate Hitler, an attempt fostered by men of highest station, was a desperate effort by internal forces in Germany to stop short of ruin. Quarrels broke out among the failing conspirators, and the decline of the Nazi power was more swift than its ascendancy. German Armed Forces surrendered, its Government disintegrated, its leaders committed suicide by the dozen, and by the fortunes of war these defendants fell into our hands. Although they are not, by any means, all the guilty ones, they are survivors among the most responsible. Their names appear over and over in the documents and their faces grace the photographic evidence. We have here the surviving top politicians, militarists, financiers, diplomats, administrators, and propagandists, of the Nazi movement. Who was responsible for these crimes if they were not?</P>

<P>The Law of the Case:</P>

<P>The end of the war and capture of these prisoners presented the victorious Allies with the question whether there is any legal responsibility on high-ranking men for acts which I have described. Must such wrongs either be ignored or redressed in hot blood? Is there no standard in the law for a deliberate and reasoned judgement on such conduct?</P>

<P>The Charter of this Tribunal evidences a faith that the law is only to govern the conduct of little men, but that even rulers are, as Lord Chief Justice Coke put it to King James, "under God and the law." The United States believed that the law long afforded standards by which a juridical hearing could be conducted to make sure that we punish only the right men and for the right reasons. Following the instructions of the late President Roosevelt and the decision of the Yalta conference President Truman directed representatives of the United States to formulate a proposed International Agreement, which was submitted during the San Francisco Conference to Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and the Provisional Government of France. With many modifications, that proposal has become the Charter of this Tribunal.</P>

<P>But the Agreement which sets up the standards by which these prisoners are to be judged does not express the views of the signatory nations alone. Other nations with diverse but highly respected systems of jurisprudence also have signified adherence to it. These are Belgium, The Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Czechoslovakia, Luxembourg, Poland, Greece, Yugoslavia, Ethiopia, Australia, Haiti, Honduras, Panama, New Zealand, Venezuela, and India. You judge, therefore, under an organic act which represents the wisdom, the sense of justice, and the will of 21 governments, representing an overwhelming majority of all civilized people.</P>

<P>The Charter by which this Tribunal has its being, embodies certain legal concepts which are inseparable from its jurisdiction ad which must govern its decision. These, as I have said, also are conditions attached to the grant of any hearing to defendants. The validity of the provisions of the Charter is conclusive upon us a whether we have accepted the duty of judging or of prosecuting under it, as well as upon the defendants, who can point no other law which gives them a right to be heard at all. My able and experienced colleagues believe, as do I, that it will contribute to the expedition and clarity of this Trial if I expound briefly the application of the legal philosophy of the Charter the facts I have recited.</P>

<P>While this declaration of the law by the Charter is final, it may be contended that the prisoners on trial are entitled to have it applied to their conduct only most charitably if at all. It may be said that this is new law, not authoritatively declared at the time they did the acts it condemns, and that this declaration of the law has taken them by surprise.</P>

<P>I cannot, of course, deny that these men are surprised that this is the law; they really are surprised that there is any such thing as law. These defendants did not rely on any law at all. Their program ignored and defied all law. That this is so will appear from many acts and statements, of which I cite but a few.</P>

<P>In the Fuehrer's speech to all military commanders on 11/23/1939 he reminded them that at the moment Germany had a pact with Russia, but declared: "Agreements are to be kept only as long as they serve a certain purpose." Later in the same speech he announced: "A violation of the neutrality of Holland and Belgium will be of no importance" (789-PS). A top secret document, entitled "Warfare as a Problem of Organization," dispatched by the Chief of the High Command to all commanders on 4/19/1938 declared that "the normal rules of war towards neutrals may be considered to apply on the basis whether operation of rules will create greater advantages or disadvantages for the belligerents" (L-211). And from the files of the German Navy Staff, we have a "Memorandum on Intensified Naval War," dated 10/15/1939, which begins by stating a desire to comply with International Law. "However," it continues, "if decisive successes are expected from any measure considered as a war necessity, it must be carried through even if it is not in agreement with international law." (L-184) International law, natural law, German law, any law at all was to these men simply a propaganda device to be invoked when it helped and to be ignored when it would condemn what they wanted to do. That men may be protected in relying upon the law at the time they act is the reason we find laws of retrospective operations unjust. But these men cannot bring themselves within the reason of the rule which in some systems of jurisprudence prohibits ex post facto laws. They cannot show that they ever relied upon international law in any state or paid it the slightest regard.</P>

<P>The third Count of the Indictment is based on the definition of War Crimes contained in the Charter. I have outlined to you the systematic course of conduct toward civilian populations and combat forces which violates international conventions to which Germany was a party. Of the criminal nature of these acts at least, the defendants had, as we shall show, clear knowledge. Accordingly they took pains to conceal their violations. It will appear that the Defendants Keitel and Jodl were informed by official legal advisors that the orders to brand Russian prisoners of war, to shackle British prisoners of war, and to execute commando prisoners were clear violations of international law. Nevertheless, these orders were put into effect. The same is true of orders issued for the assassination of General Giraud and General Weygand, which failed to be executed only because of a ruse on the part of Admiral Canaris, who was himself later executed for his part in the plot to take Hitler's life on 7/20/1944.</P>

<P>The fourth Count of the Indictment is based on Crimes against Humanity. Chief among these are mass killings of countless human beings in cold blood. Does it take these men by surprise that murder is treated as a crime? [=]</P>

<P>Full Text:</P>

<P>The first and second Counts of the Indictment add to these crimes the crime of plotting and waging wars of aggression and as in violation of nine treaties to which Germany was a party. There was a time, in fact, I think the time of the first World War, it could not have been said that war-inciting or war making was a crime in law, however reprehensible in morals.</P>

<P>Of course, it was, under the law of all civilized peoples, a crime one man with his bare knuckles to assault another. How did it come that multiplying this crime by a million, and adding fire arms to bare knuckles, made it a legally innocent act? The doctrine was that one could not be regarded as criminal for committing the usual violent acts in the conduct of legitimate warfare. The age of imperialistic expansion during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries added the foul doctrine, contrary to the teachings of early Christian and international law scholars such as Grotius, that all wars are to be regarded as legitimate wars. The sum of these two doctrines was to give war-making a complete immunity from accountability to law.</P>

<P>This was intolerable for an age that called itself civilized. Plain people with their earthy common sense, revolted at such fictions and legalisms so contrary to ethical principles and demanded checks on war immunities. Statesmen and international lawyers at first cautiously responded by adopting rules of warfare designed to make the conduct of war more civilized. The effort was to set legal limits to the violence that could be done to civilian populations and to combatants as well.</P>

<P>The common sense of men after the first World War demanded, however, that the law's condemnation of war reach deeper, and that the law condemn not merely uncivilized ways of waging war, but also the waging in any way of uncivilized warswars of aggression. The world's statesmen again went only as far as they were forced to go. Their efforts were timid and cautious and often less explicit than we might have hoped. But the 1920's did outlaw ggressive war.</P>

<P>The re-establishment of the principle that there are unjust wars and that unjust wars are illegal is traceable in many steps. One of the most significant is the Briand-Kellogg Pact of 1928, by which Germany, Italy, and Japan, in common with practically all nations of the world, renounced war as an instrument of national policy, bound themselves to seek the settlement of disputes only by pacific means, and condemned recourse to war for the solution of international controversies. This pact altered the legal status of a war of aggression. As Mr. Stimson, the United States Secretary of State put it in 1932, such a war:</P>

<P>"... is no longer to be the source and subject of rights. It is no longer to be the principle around which the duties, the conduct, and the rights of nations revolve. It is an illegal thing.... By that very act, we have made obsolete many legal precedents and have given the legal profession the task of re-examining many of its codes and treaties."</P>

<P>The Geneva Protocol of 1924 for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes, signed by the representatives of 48 governments declared that "a war of aggression constitutes ... an international crime." The Eighth Assembly of the League of Nations in 1927, on unanimous resolution of the representatives of 48 member nations including Germany, declared that a war of aggression constitutes ar international crime. At the Sixth Pan-American Conference of 1928 the 21 American Republics unanimously adopted a resolution stating that "war of aggression constitutes an international crime against the human species."</P>

<P>A failure of these Nazis to heed, or to understand the force and meaning of this evolution in the legal thought of the world, is not a defense or a mitigation. If anything, it aggravates their offense and makes it the more mandatory that the law they have flouted be vindicated by juridical application to their lawless conduct. Indeed by their own lawhad they heeded any lawthese principles were binding on these defendants. Article 4 of the Weimar constitution provided that: "The generally accepted rules of inter national law are to be considered as binding integral parts of the law of the German Reich" (2050- PS). Can there be any doubt that the outlawry of aggressive war was one of the "generally accepted rules of international law" in 1939?</P>

<P>Any resort to warto any kind of a waris a resort to means that are inherently criminal. War inevitably is a course of killings assaults, deprivations of liberty, and destruction of property. An honestly defensive war is, of course, legal and saves those lawfully conducting it from criminality. But inherently criminal acts cannot be defended by showing that those who committed them were engaged in a war, when war itself is illegal. The very minimum legal consequence of the treaties making aggressive wars illegal is to strip those who incite or wage them of every defense the law ever gave, and to leave war-makers subject to judgment by the usually accepted principles of the law of crimes.</P>

<P>But if it be thought that the Charter, whose declarations concededly bind us all, does contain new law I still do not shrink from demanding its strict application by this Tribunal. The rule of law in the world, flouted by the lawlessness incited by these defendants, had to be restored at the cost to my country of over a million casualties, not to mention those of other nations. I cannot subscribe to the perverted reasoning that society may advance and strengthen the rule of law by the expenditure of morally innocent lives but that progress in the law may never be made at the price of morally guilty lives.</P>

<P>It is true of course, that we have no judicial precedent for the Charter. But international law is more than a scholarly collection of abstract and immutable principles. It is an outgrowth of treaties and agreements between nations and of accepted customs. Yet every custom has its origin in some single act, and every agreement has to be initiated by the action of some state. Unless we are prepared to abandon every principle of growth for international law, we cannot deny that our own day has the right to institute customs and to conclude agreements that will themselves become sources of a newer and strengthened international law. International law is not capable of development by the normal processes of legislation, for there is no continuing international legislative authority. Innovations and revisions in international law are brought about by the action of governments such as those I have cited, designed to meet a change in circumstances. It grows, as did the common law, through decisions reached from time to time in adapting settled principles to new situations. The fact is that when the law evolves by the case method, as did the common law and as international law must do if it is to advance at all, it advances at the expense of those who wrongly guessed the law and learned too late their error. The law, so far as international law can be decreed, had been clearly pronounced when these acts took place. Hence, I am not disturbed by the lack of judicial precedent for the inquiry it is proposed to conduct.</P>

<P>The events I have earlier recited clearly fall within the standards of Crimes, set out in the Charter, whose perpetrators this Tribunal is convened to judge and punish fittingly. The standards for War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity are too familiar to need comment. There are, however, certain novel problems in applying other precepts of the Charter which I should call to your attention. [=]</P>

<P>The Crime against Peace:</P>

<P>A basic provision of the Charter is that to plan, prepare, initiate, or wage a war of aggression, or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements, and assurances, or to conspire or participate in a common plan to do so, is a crime.</P>

<P>It is perhaps a weakness in this Charter that it fails itself define a war of aggression. Abstractly, the subject is full of difficulty and all kinds of troublesome hypothetical cases can be conjured up. It is a subject which, if the defense should be permitted to go afield beyond the very narrow charge in the Indictment would prolong the Trial and involve the Tribunal in insoluble political issues. But so far as the question can properly be involved in this case, the issue is one of no novelty and is one on which legal opinion has well crystalized.</P>

<P>One of the most authoritative sources of international law on this subject is the Convention for the Definition of Aggression Signed at London on 7/3/1933 by Romania, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Turkey, the Soviet Union, Persia, and Afghanistan. The subject has also been considered by international committees and by commentators whose views are entitled to the greatest respect. It had been little discussed prior to the first World War but has received much attention as international law has evolved its outlawry of aggressive war. In the light of these materials of international law and so far as relevant to the evidence in this case, I suggest that an "aggressor" is generally held to be that state which is the first to commit any of the following actions:</P>

<P>(1) Declaration of war upon another state;</P>

<P>(2) Invasion by its armed forces, with or without a declaration of war, of the territory of another state;</P>

<P>(3) Attack by its land, naval, or air forces, with or without a declaration of war, on the territory, vessels or aircraft of another state; and</P>

<P>(4) Provision of support to armed bands formed in the territory of another state, or refusal, notwithstanding the request of the invaded state, to take in its own territory, all the measures in its power to deprive those bands of all assistance or protection.</P>

<P>And I further suggest that it is the general view that no political military, economic, or other considerations shall serve as an excuse or justification for such actions; but exercise of the right of legitimate self-defense, that is to say, resistance to an act of aggression, or action to assist a state which has been subjected to aggression, shall not constitute a war of aggression.</P>

<P>It is upon such an understanding of the law that our evidence of a conspiracy to provoke and wage an aggressive war is prepared and presented. By this test each of the series of wars begun by these Nazi leaders was unambiguously aggressive.</P>

<P>It is important to the duration and scope of this Trial that we bear in mind the difference between our charge that this war was one of aggression and a position that Germany had no grievances. We. are not inquiring into the conditions which contributed to causing this war. They are for history to unravel. It is no part of our task to vindicate the European status quo as of 1933, or as of any other date. The United States does not desire to enter into discussion of the complicated pre-war currents of European politics, and it hopes this trial will not be protracted by their consideration. The remote causations avowed are too insincere and inconsistent, too complicated and doctrinaire to be the subject of profitable inquiry in this trial A familiar example is to be found in the Lebensraum slogan, which summarized the contention that Germany needed more living space as a justification for expansion. At the same time that the Nazis were demanding more space for the German people, they were demanding more German people to occupy space. Every known means to increase the birth rate, legitimate and illegitimate, was utilized. "Lebensraum" represented a vicious circle of demandfrom neighbors more space, and from Germans more progeny. We do not need to investigate the verity of doctrines which led to constantly expanding circles of aggression. It is the plot and the act of aggression which we charge to be crimes.</P>

<P>Our position is that whatever grievances a nation may have, however objectionable it finds the status quo, aggressive warfare is illegal means for settling those grievances or for altering those conditions. It may be that the Germany of the 1920's and 1930's faced desperate problems, problems that would have warranted the boldest measures short of war. All other methodspersuasion, propaganda, economic competition, diplomacywere open to an aggrieved country, but aggressive warfare was outlawed. These defendants did make aggressive war, a war in violation of treaties. They did attack and invade their neighbors in order to effectuate a foreign policy which they knew could not be accomplished by measures short of war. And that is as far as we accuse or propose to inquire. [=]</P>

<P>The Law of Individual Responsibility:</P>

<P>The Charter also recognizes individual responsibility on the Part of those who commit acts defined as crimes, or who incite others to do so, or who join a common plan with other persons, groups or organizations to bring about their commission. The principle of individual responsibility for piracy and brigandage. which have long been recognized as crimes punishable under international law, is old and well established. That is what illegal warfare is.</P>

<P>This principle of personal liability is a necessary as well as logical one if international law is to render real help to the maintenance of peace. An international law which operates only on states can be enforced only by war because the most practicable method of coercing a state is warfare. Those familiar with American history know that one of the compelling reasons for adoption of our constitution was that the laws of the Confederation, which operated only on constituent states, were found ineffective to maintain order among them. The only answer to recalcitrance was impotence or war. Only sanctions which reach individuals can peacefully and effectively be enforced. Hence, the principle of the criminality of aggressive war is implemented by the Charter with the principle of personal responsibility. Of course, the idea that a state, any more than a corporation commits crimes, is a fiction. Crimes always are committed only by persons. While it is quite proper to employ the fiction of responsibility of a state or corporation for the purpose of imposing a collective liability, it is quite intolerable to let such a legalism become the basis of personal immunity. The Charter recognizes that one who has committed criminal acts may not take refuge in superior orders nor in the doctrine that his crimes were acts of states. These twin principles working together have heretofore resulted in immunity for practically everyone concerned in the really great crimes against peace and mankind. Those in lower ranks were protected against liability by the orders of their superiors. The superiors were protected because their orders were called acts of state. Under the Charter, no defense based on either of these doctrines can be entertained. Modern civilization puts unlimited weapons of destruction in the hands of men. It cannot tolerate so vast an area of legal irresponsibility. Even the German Military Code provides that: "If the execution of a military order in the course of duty violates the criminal law, then the superior officer giving the order will bear the sole responsibility therefor. However, the obeying subordinate will share the punishment of the participant: (1) if he has exceeded the order given to him, or (2) if it was within his knowledge that the order of his superior officer concerned an act by which it was intended to commit a civil or military crime or transgression." (Reichsgesetzblatt, 1926 No. 37, P. 278, Art. 47) Of course, we do not argue that the circumstances under which one commits an act should be disregarded in judging its legal effect. A conscripted private on a firing squad cannot expect to hold an inquest on the validity of the execution. The Charter implies common sense limits to liability just as it places common sense limits upon immunity. But none of these men before you acted in minor parts. Each of them was entrusted with broad discretion and exercised great power. Their responsibility is correspondingly great and may not be shifted to that fictional being, "the State", which cannot be produced for trial, cannot testify, and cannot be sentenced.</P>

<P>The Charter also recognizes a vicarious liability, which responsibility recognized by most modern systems of law, for acts committed by others in carrying out a common plan or conspiracy to which a defendant has become a party. I need not discuss the familiar principles of such liability. Every day in the courts of countries associated in this prosecution, men are convicted for acts that they did not personally commit, but for which they were held responsible because of membership in illegal combinations or plans or conspiracies.</P>

<P>The Political, Police, and Military Organizations:</P>

<P>Accused before this Tribunal as criminal organizations are certain political and police organizations which the evidence will show to have been instruments of cohesion in planning and executing the crimes I have detailed. Perhaps the worst of the movement were the Leadership Corps of the NSDAP, the Schutzstaffeln or and the Sturmabteilungen or "SA", and the subsidiary formations which these include. These were the Nazi Party leadership, espionage, and policing groups. They were the real government, above and outside of any law. Also accused as organizations are the Reich Cabinet and the Secret Police, or Gestapo, which were fixtures of the Government but animated solely by the Party.</P>

<P>Except for a late period when some compulsory recruiting was done in the SS, membership in all these militarized organizations was voluntary. The police organizations were recruited from ardent partisans who enlisted blindly to do the dirty work the leaders planned The Reich Cabinet was the governmental facade for Nazi Party Government and in its members legal, as well as actual responsibility was vested for the entire program. Collectively they were responsible for the program in general, individually they were especially responsible for segments of it. The finding which we ask you to make, that these are criminal organizations, will subject members to punishment to be hereafter determined by appropriate tribunals, unless some personal defensesuch as becoming a member under threat to person, to family, or inducement by false representation, or the likebe established. Every member will have a chance to be heard in the subsequent forum on his personal relation to the organization, but your finding in this trial will conclusively establish the criminal character of the organization as a whole.</P>

<P>We have also accused as criminal organizations the High Command and the General Staff of the German Armed Forces. We recognize that to plan warfare is the business of professional soldiers in all countries. But it is one thing to plan strategic moves in the event war comes, and it is another thing to plot and intrigue to bring on that war. We will prove the leaders of the German General Staff and of the High Command to have been guilty of just that. Military men are not before you because they served their country. They are here because they mastered it, along with these others, and drove it to war. They are not here because they lost the war, but because they started it. Politicians may have thought of them as soldiers, but soldiers know they were politicians. We ask that the General Staff and the High Command, as defined in the Indictment, be condemned as a criminal group whose existence and tradition constitute a standing menace to the peace of the world.</P>

<P>These individual defendants did not stand alone in crime and will not stand alone in punishment. Your verdict of " guilty" against these organizations will render prima facie guilt, as nearly as we can learn, thousands upon thousands of members now in custody of United States forces and of other armies.

<P>The responsibility of this Tribunal:</P>

<P>To apply the sanctions of the law to those whose conduct is found criminal by the standards I have outlined, is the responsibility committed to this Tribunal. It is the first court ever to undertake the difficult task of overcoming the confusion of many tongues and the conflicting concepts of just procedure among divers systems of law, so as to reach a common judgment. The tasks of all of us are such as to make heavy demands on patience and good will. Although the need for prompt action has admittedly resulted in imperfect work on the part of the Prosecution, four great nations bring you their hurriedly assembled contributions of evidence. What remains undiscovered we can only guess. We could, with witnesses' testimony, prolong the recitals of crime for yearsbut to what avail. We shall rest the case when we have offered what seems convincing and adequate proof of the crimes charged without unnecessary cumulation of evidence. We doubt very much whether it will be seriously denied that the crimes I have outlined took place. The effort will undoubtedly be to mitigate or escape personal responsibility.</P>

<P>Among the nations which unite in accusing these defendants the United States is perhaps in a position to be the most dispassionate, for, having sustained the least injury, it is perhaps the least animated by vengeance. Our American cities have not been bombed by day and by night, by humans, and by robots. It is not our temples that had been laid in ruins. Our countrymen have not had homes destroyed over their heads. The menace of Nazi aggression, except to those in actual service, has seemed less personal and immediate to us than to European peoples. But while the United States is not first in rancor, it is not second in determination that forces of law and order be made equal to the task of dealing such international lawlessness as I have recited here.</P>

<P>Twice in my lifetime, the United States has sent its young manhood across the Atlantic, drained its resources, and burdened itself with debt to help defeat Germany. But the real hope and faith that has sustained the American people in these great efforts was that victory for ourselves and our Allies would lay the basis for an ordered international relationship in Europe and would end the centuries of strife on this embattled continent.</P>

<P>Twice we have held back in the early stages of European conflict in the belief that it might be confined to a purely European affair. In the United States, we have tried to build an economy without armament, a system of government without militarism, and a society where men are not regimented for war. This purpose, we know now, can never be realized if the world periodically is to be embroiled in war. The United States cannot, generation after generation, throw its youth or its resources on to the battlefields of Europe to redress the lack of balance between Germany's strength and that of her enemies, and to keep the battles from our shores.</P>

<P>The American dream of a peace-and-plenty economy, as well as the hopes of other nations, can never be fulfilled if those nations are involved in a war every generation so vast and devastating as to crush the generation that fights and burden the generation that follows. But experience has shown that wars are no longer local. All modern wars become world wars eventually. And none of the big nations at least can stay out. If we cannot stay out of wars, our only hope is to prevent wars.</P>

<P>I am too well aware of the weaknesses of juridical action alone to contend that in itself your decision under this Charter can prevent future wars. Judicial action always comes after the event. Wars are started only on the theory and in the confidence that they can be won. Personal punishment, to be suffered only in the event the war is lost, will probably not be a sufficient deterrent to prevent a war where the warmakers feel the chances of defeat to be negligible.</P>

<P>But the ultimate step in avoiding periodic wars, which are inevitable in a system of international lawlessness, is to make statesmen responsible to law. And let me make clear that while this law is first applied against German aggressors, the law includes, and if it is to serve a useful purpose it must condemn aggression by any other nations, including those which sit here now in judgment. We are able to do away with domestic tyranny and violence and aggression by those in power against the rights of their own people only when we make all men answerable to the law. This trial represents mankind's desperate effort to apply the discipline of the law to statesmen who have used their powers of state to attack the foundations of the world's peace and to commit aggressions against the rights of their neighbors.</P>

<P>The usefulness of this effort to do justice is not to be measured by considering the law or your judgment in isolation. This trial is part of the great effort to make the peace more secure. One step in this direction is the United Nations organization, which may take joint political action to prevent war if possible, and joint military action to insure that any nation which starts a war will lose it This Charter and this Trial, implementing the Kellogg-Briand Pact constitute another step in the same directionjuridical action of a kind to ensure that those who start a war will pay for it personally.</P>

<P>While the defendants and the prosecutors stand before you as individuals, it is not the triumph of either group alone that is committed to your judgment Above all personalities there are anonymous and impersonal forces whose conflict makes up much of human history. It is yours to throw the strength of the law back of either the one or the other of these forces for at least another generation. What are the real forces that are contending before you?</P>

<P>No charity can disguise the fact that the forces which these defendants represent, the forces that would advantage and delight in their acquittal, are the darkest and most sinister forces in societydictatorship and oppression, malevolence and passion, militarism and lawlessness. By their fruits we best know them. Their acts have bathed the world in blood and set civilization back a century. They have subjected their European neighbors to every outrage and torture, every spoliation and deprivation that insolence, cruelty, and greed could inflict. They have brought the German people to the lowest pitch of wretchedness, from which they can entertain no hope of early deliverance. They have stirred hatreds and incited domestic violence on every continent. These are the things that stand in the dock shoulder to shoulder with these prisoners.</P>

<P>The real complaining party at your bar is Civilization. In all countries it is still a struggling and imperfect thing. It does not plead that the United States, or any other country, has been blameless of the conditions which made the German people easy victims to the blandishments and intimidations of the Nazi conspirators.</P>

<P>But it points to the dreadful sequence of aggressions and crimes I have recited, it points to the weariness of flesh, the exhaustion of resources and the destruction of all that was beautiful or useful in so much of the world, and to greater potentialities for destruction in the days to come. It is not necessary among the ruins of this ancient and beautiful city with untold members of its civilian habitants still buried in its rubble, to argue the proposition that to start or wage an aggressive war has the moral qualities of the worst of crimes. The refuge of the defendants can be only their hope that international law will lag so far behind the moral sense of mankind that conduct which is crime in the moral sense must be regarded as innocent in law.</P>

<P>Civilization asks whether law is so laggard as to be utterly helpless to deal with crimes of this magnitude by criminals of this order of importance. It does not expect that you can make war impossible. It does expect that your juridical action will put the forces of international law, its precepts, its prohibitions and, most of all, its sanctions, on the side of peace, so that men and women of good will, in all countries, may have "leave to live by no man's leave, underneath the law."</P>
