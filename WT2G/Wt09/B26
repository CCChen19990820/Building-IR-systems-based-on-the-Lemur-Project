     TAJIK GOVERNMENT SCOFFS AT OPPOSITION PROPOSAL. Peace negotiations <br>
     between the Tajik government and United Tajik Opposition (UTO) taking <br>
     place in Tehran became bogged down on 8 January, RFE/RL reported. UTO <br>
     representatives had the impression the planned National Reconciliation <br>
     Commission would consist of 40% representation from both the <br>
     government and the UTO, with the remaining 20% being made up of <br>
     regional and ethnic groups. However, government negotiators in Tehran <br>
     now say they want an 80% share of the commission to be from the Tajik <br>
     government and that all proposals for amendments to the constitution <br>
     be approved by a two-thirds vote. The deputy leader for the UTO, Ali <br>
     Akbar Turajonzoda, said that is not what was agreed at the Moscow <br>
     talks in December between Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov and UTO <br>
     leader Said Abdullo Nuri. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     FIRST BRIGADE TO LEAVE TURSUN ZADE. The commander of Tajikistan's <br>
     First Brigade, Col. Mahmud Khudaberdiyev, said on 9 January, he and <br>
     his unit are ready to comply with a presidential order that they <br>
     return to their base in Kurgan-Tyube, international media reported. <br>
     Khudaberdiyev's unit managed to push the outlaw group of Kadyr <br>
     Abdullayev outside the city limits, according to Russian television. <br>
     Abdullayev says he will not surrender nor heed Khudaberdiyev's order <br>
     that he permanently vacate Tursun Zade. Khudaberdiyev said he was <br>
     satisfied with the recapture of military hardware Abdullayev's group <br>
     stole from the First Brigade on 29 December and the departure of <br>
     Abdullayev's criminal band from the city. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     FIGHTING BREAKS OUT IN TURSUN ZADE. Despite a presidential order to <br>
     withdraw his forces from the Tursun Zade area, elements of Col. Mahmud <br>
     Khudaberdiyev's First Brigade attacked outlaw forces in the city on 8 <br>
     January, international media reported. Khudaberdiyev had moved his <br>
     force close to the city claiming that Tursun Zade's criminal band, <br>
     loyal to former Popular Front commander Kadyr Abdullayev, raided the <br>
     First Brigade's headquarters on 29 December to steal weapons, in the <br>
     process killing one officer. Khudaberdiyev said the attack was sparked <br>
     by the government's refusal to do anything about the situation. He is <br>
     demanding Abdullayev return the weapons and vacate the city. Efforts <br>
     by the Tajik government, Russian forces in Tajikistan, and the UN <br>
     observer mission to mediate the isolated conflict have not met with <br>
     any success. Both government and opposition representatives say the <br>
     fighting in Tursun Zade will not have an impact on peace talks being <br>
     held in Tehran. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

          TAJIK BRIGADE COMMANDER DISOBEYS ORDER, CONTINUES FIGHTING<br>
          <br>
                         DUSHANBE, Jan  8 (Interfax)  - Makhmud Khudoberdiyev, <br>
          the commander of  a rapid  deployment brigade,  has  disobeyed  an <br>
          order to  withdraw from  Tursunzade by Tajik President Emomali<br>
          Rakhmonov,  the   supreme  commander   of  the  armed  forces,<br>
          presidential  press   secretary  Zafar  Saidov  told  Interfax<br>
          Wednesday.<br>
                Rakhmonov had demanded Khudoberdiyev withdraw his brigadefrom  <br>
          Tursunzade,  situated  54  kilometers  to  the  west  of Dushanbe, to  <br>
          its permanent  location in Kurgantyube by 4 p.m.Wednesday.<br>
                Due to  Khudoberdiyev's refusal  to obey  the order,  the <br>
          situation in  the western  part of  Tajikistan  remains  quite<br>
          tense, Saidov said.<br>
                However, an  Interfax correspondent has reported from thesuburbs <br>
           of   Tursunzade  that   Khudoberdiyev's  brigade  hadadvanced 12 more <br>
          kilometers to the west by 6 p.m. local time.       <br>
                Khudoberdiyev's brigade  and his  supporters  from  local <br>
          self-defense units  seized a  major  aluminum  plant  and  the<br>
          eastern suburbs  of Tursunzade, servicemen at outposts outside<br>
          the city told Interfax.<br>
                According to  some reports,  Khudoberdiyev  demanded  the <br>
          resignation of  the Tursunzade  mayor and  the  street  police<br>
          chief.<br>
                Earlier in  the morning,  Khudoberdiyev demanded that thelocal <br>
          gang  headed by  Kadyr Abdullayev  return arms seized in the city  on <br>
          December 29, 1996, and hand over the killers of a brigade officer.<br>
          Witnesses  reported   shoot-outs  in   the   suburbs   of<br>
          Tursunzade during  the day.  At least  four people  have  been<br>
          killed and more wounded, their exact number unknown.<br>
                The military  did not  let a  group of  Russian reporterswithin <br>
          15 kilometers of Tursunzade. The Tajik  leadership still  wants to <br>
          settle the conflict by way of negotiation, without using force, Saidov <br>
          said.<br>

     TROUBLE IN TAJIKISTAN'S "WILD WEST." Elements of Tajikistan's First <br>
     Brigade moved toward the western city of Tursun Zade during the night <br>
     of 7-8 January, ITAR-TASS reported. The brigade is under the command <br>
     of Col. Mahmud Khudaberdiyev, who last January led one of two mutinies <br>
     which for two weeks threatened the capital Dushanbe. The other mutiny <br>
     was led by the former mayor of Tursun Zade, Ibodullo Baimatov. Like <br>
     Khudaberdiyev, Baimatov returned to his base following concessions by <br>
     the government. Since then, control of Tursun Zade, the site of the <br>
     largest aluminum plant in Central Asia, has been contested by several <br>
     criminal groups. Baimatov was ousted by late summer 1996 but the city <br>
     remained outside the jurisdiction of the government. Khudaberdiyev <br>
     mended relations with the Tajik government and sources from the <br>
     brigade's headquarters say this latest move is an attempt to restore <br>
     order in Tursun Zade. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     TAJIK TALKS OPEN IN IRAN. With a ceasefire agreed in Moscow in <br>
     December by Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov and United Tajik <br>
     Opposition (UTO) leader Said Abdullo Nuri still holding, delegations <br>
     from both sides met in the Iranian capital Tehran on 6 January, <br>
     international media reported. The talks, delayed by one day, are to <br>
     discuss the formation of a National Reconciliation Commission which is <br>
     to help pave the way for new parliamentary elections within 12-18 <br>
     months. Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati welcomed members <br>
     of the delegations and called on them to "be forgiving and show <br>
     understanding." AFP reports that the formation of the commission <br>
     dominated the first day of the talks, with the government delegation <br>
     rejecting a proposal for 40% of the commission to be made up of UTO <br>
     representatives. Talks are scheduled to continue all this week. -- <br>

     TERRORISM IN TAJIK CAPITAL. The bodies of two Tajik military officials <br>
     were found on the outskirts of Dushanbe on 3 January, RFE/RL reported. <br>
     Both were killed, in separate incidents, by a shot from a pistol. On 4 <br>
     January two bombs went off in downtown Dushanbe, killing one and <br>
     injuring five, Russian sources reported. The first blast occurred near <br>
     a market when four servicemen from the CIS peacekeeping force and <br>
     201st Motorized Rifle Division attempted to start their car after <br>
     buying goods at the market. One serviceman was killed, the others were <br>
     wounded along with two civilian passers-by. The other bomb went off <br>
     two hours later, destroying a police post near the presidential <br>
     palace. No casualties were reported. Just prior to these latest <br>
     attacks the Russian Foreign Ministry had expressed its alarm at the <br>
     increase in attacks on peacekeepers, noting that between 27 December <br>
     and 2 January six Russian soldiers were killed and eight wounded in or <br>
     near Dushanbe. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     TERRORISM IN TAJIK CAPITAL. The ceasefire agreed to by Tajik President <br>
     Imomali Rakhmonov and United Tajik Opposition leader Said Abdullo Nuri <br>
     in Moscow on 23 December appears to be holding, although the number of <br>
     terrorist attacks on Russian soldiers and support personnel in <br>
     Dushanbe has increased since 23 December, according to Russian media <br>
     reports. On 28 December, five soldiers were wounded when their vehicle <br>
     was attacked: on 2 or 3 January, a Russian soldier was shot and killed <br>
     in Dushanbe's Sakhovat district and the bodies of a Russian doctor and <br>
     nurse were found on a Dushanbe street on 3 January. Both the Tajik <br>
     government and opposition are blaming the attacks on groups that are <br>
     trying to derail the peace agreement. * Bruce Pannier<br>

     TAJIK PRESIDENT ISSUES DECREE TO SPEED UP PRIVATIZATION<br>
     <br>
     DUSHANBE, Dec 29 (Interfax) - President Emomali Rakhmonov<br>
     of  Tajikistan   Sunday  signed   a   decree   to   accelerate <br>
     privatization.<br>
        The decree  aims to  form the securities market, speed up<br>
     privatization, change  the social structure of the population, and <br>
     attract foreign and national investments, Tajik government experts <br>
     told Interfax.<br>
        The decree  assesses the  transformation  of  enterprises<br>
     into joint-stock  companies as  the preliminary  stage of  the <br>
     privatization of large and medium-sized businesses. The decree defines <br>
     privatized  enterprises as  enterprises in  which  the controlling <br>
     interest is not state-owned.<br>
        In  line   with  the   decree,  the   transformation   of<br>
     enterprises  into   public  joint-stock  companies  should  be <br>
     completed before September 1, 1997.<br>
     To prevent  the appearance of monopolies on some markets,<br>
     the existing structure of enterprises will have to be revised, the <br>
     Tajik  president said. Enterprises on some markets will be privatized <br>
     only  after they  are broken  down into a number of units.<br>
     The president  instructed the  government to  prepare and<br>
     approve a  procedure to  break down enterprises for the future <br>
     privatization of their units.<br>
        The president  also ordered  that a  state commission for<br>
     economic reform,  which will  include the  prime minister, the <br>
     presidential economics  adviser, the  economics,  finance  and justice <br>
     ministers, and the National Bank governor, be created.<br>

                      TAJIK GROUP FREES REBEL MEMBER OF JOINT COMMISSION<br>
     <br>
                    DUSHANBE, Dec  26 (Interfax)  - A  Tajik armed  group  on<br>
               Wednesday evening  freed one  of the  two members of the Joint<br>
               Cease-fire Commission taken hostage on December 20.<br>
                    Izatullo Ibodzoda,  a representative  of the United Tajik<br>
               Opposition, was exchanged for the brother of the armed group's<br>
               commander Rizvon Sadirov, released by the supreme commander of<br>
     <br>
               the Tavildara  group of forces of the United Tajik Opposition,<br>
               Mirzo Zikeyev.<br>
                    Ibodzoda was taken by car to Dushanbe by a representative<br>
               of field commander Bakhrom, a spokesman for the Tajik Security<br>
               Council told  Interfax Thursday. However, the other opposition<br>
               representative in  the commission,  Yusuf Khakimov,  is  still<br>
               held hostage.<br>
                    The two officials were captured on a highway during their<br>
               trip to the district center of Garm situated 150 kilometers to<br>
               the  east   of  Dushanbe.  U.N.  military  observers  and  the<br>
               government  officials   who  accompanied  them  were  released<br>
               shortly after their capture.<br>
                    Khakimov's release  will continue  to  be  negotiated  on<br>
               December 27.<br>
                    Tajik Security  Council Secretary Amirkul Azimov plans to<br>
               fly to  Garm by  the end  of today  to continue  talks on  the<br>
               resumption of local authorities and Khakimov's release.<br>

     TAJIK PRESIDENT, OPPOSITION LEADER SIGN AGREEMENTS IN MOSCOW<br>
     <br>
                    MOSCOW, Dec  23  (Interfax)  -  Tajik  President  Emomali<br>
               Rakhmonov and  leader of  the United  Tajik  Opposition  Sayed<br>
               Abdullo Nuri  have signed  two documents which are expected to<br>
               end the fratricidal confrontation in Tajikistan. The documents<br>
               were signed  at Moscow's  President-Hotel in  the presence  of<br>
               Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.<br>
                    The sides  signed an  agreement between  the president of<br>
               Tajikistan and  the leader  of the  United Tajik Opposition on<br>
               the results  of the  Moscow summit,  and  a  protocol  on  the<br>
               functions  and   powers   of   the   National   Reconciliation<br>
               Commission.<br>
                    In  accordance   with  the   documents,  the  sides  have<br>
               committed themselves  to completing  the inter-Tajik  talks by<br>
               July 1  for the purpose of restoring peace in Tajikistan. They<br>
               are also  planning to  announce a general amnesty and exchange<br>
               prisoners of  war. In line with the protocol, this job will be<br>
               done by the National Reconciliation Commission during the next<br>
               12-18 months.<br>
                    The  protocol   says  that  the  National  Reconciliation<br>
               Commission shall  be set  up for  the transitional  period and<br>
               that its  functions will  be  defined  and  members  appointed<br>
     <br>
               during the next round of the inter-Tajik talks. The commission<br>
               is to  be led  by a  representative  of  the  opposition.  The<br>
               document fully corresponds to the Tajik Constitution.<br>
                    "Given the  beginning of a qualitatively new stage in the<br>
               work to  achieve peace  and national accord in Tajikistan, the<br>
               sides will  shape a National Reconciliation Commission for the<br>
               transitional period,"  says the  protocol, a copy of which was<br>
               made available to Interfax.<br>
                    "The main  task of  the commission is to achieve national<br>
               reconciliation by  implementing the  agreements reached during<br>
               the inter-Tajik  talks, by creating an atmosphere of trust and<br>
               mutual forgiveness, and by initiating a broad dialogue between<br>
               different political  forces for  the  sake  of  restoring  and<br>
               strengthening civic accord in Tajikistan," says the protocol.<br>
                    The protocol  confers the  following functions  upon  the<br>
               commission:<br>
                    - to  develop a  mechanism for and exercise monitoring of<br>
               the implementation  of the  peace and accord agreement by both<br>
               sides together with other bodies created for this purpose;<br>
                    - to  carry out  measures to  make possible  a  safe  and<br>
               dignified return  of refugees,  their active engagement in the<br>
               country's social,  political and economic life, to promote the<br>
               reconstruction  of   war-damaged   housing,   industrial   and<br>
               agricultural facilities;<br>
                    - to  develop proposals  on amending  laws  on  political<br>

                    The president  and the National Reconciliation Commission<br>
               will exercise  the following  functions and  powers during the<br>
               transitional period:<br>

     TAJIK OPPOSITION FREES CAPTIVES; MOSCOW TALKS DELAYED. The Tajik <br>
     opposition on 18 December released 39 hostages captured in recent <br>
     fighting, RFE/RL reported. Those freed were described only as "high- <br>
     ranking" officials. The move was agreed at a meeting of Tajik <br>
     President Imomali Rakhmonov and opposition leader Said Abdullo Nuri on <br>
     10-11 December. Talks between the two leaders in Moscow scheduled for <br>
     19 December have been pushed back a day as Nuri's departure was <br>
     delayed by an opposition meeting in Tehran on 18 December, according <br>
     to Russian sources. In a brief interview with Nezavisimaya gazeta on <br>
     19 December, Rakhmonov said that a national reconciliation council <br>
     must be set up but-a stipulation of the original cease-fire agreement <br>
     signed in Tehran in 1994-but added: "It's not our fault the agreement <br>
     has not been realized." * Bruce Pannier<br>

     UN OBSERVERS IN TAJIKISTAN VICTIMS OF "MOCK EXECUTION." Two teams of <br>
     UN observers in Tajikistan were stopped at a government checkpoint, <br>
     verbally and physically abused, and subject to forced to stand in a <br>
     line for a mock execution, according to an 18 December UN press <br>
     release. The teams were traveling to Garm to verify reports of <br>
     cease-fire violations in the area when they were stopped at the <br>
     Saripul post. Their communications equipment was confiscated and <br>
     members of the teams were ordered to line up in a field for execution. <br>
     Government soldiers then fired above and around the men. The UN team <br>
     was able to escape when the appearance of a car on the road diverted <br>
     the soldiers' attention. This is the second time this month that <br>
     government forces have mistreated UN observers. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     FREEDOM HOUSE REPORT NOTES LACK OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN CENTRAL ASIA. In <br>
     its annual survey of freedom and democracy worldwide, the U.S.-based <br>
     Freedom House identified Tajikistan and Turkmenistan as among the 17 <br>
     most repressive regimes in the world, RFE-RL reported on 18 December. <br>
     Uzbekistan, which last year also appeared in the worst category, <br>
     improved its record in 1996. Among the CIS countries, Armenia, <br>
     Georgia, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine are rated "partly free;" and <br>
     Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, <br>
     and Uzbekistan are listed as "not free." Freedom House ratings are <br>
     based on a check- list of political rights and civil liberties, <br>
     including the degree of autonomy for minorities, the status of the <br>
     opposition, the nature of electoral laws, and the degree of freedom of <br>
     assembly and freedom of the media. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     CEASE-FIRE TAKING HOLD IN TAJIKISTAN. The cease-fire agreement signed <br>
     at the conclusion of a 10-11 December meeting between Tajik President <br>
     Imomali Rakhmonov and opposition leader Said Abdullo Nuri appears to <br>
     be reducing fighting in central Tajikistan, according to international <br>
     sources. This latest agreement seemed doomed when less than 24 hours <br>
     after its signing two bombs went off in the Tajik capital and fighting <br>
     was reported in Garm. Four government soldiers were killed and 14 <br>
     wounded in the town on 13 December. However, by 15 December only <br>
     sporadic gunfire was reported near Garm, although a special unit of <br>
     government troops remains surrounded. AFP reported that a special <br>
     meeting was held on 13 December in Dushanbe attended by <br>
     representatives of the government, opposition, and UN special envoy <br>
     Gerd Merrem to prevent the cease-fire agreement from falling apart. -- <br>

               TAJIK OPPOSITION KILLS FOUR, WOUNDS 14 GOVT TROOPS<br>
     <br>
                    DUSHANBE, Dec  13 (Interfax)  - Tajik  opposition  rebels<br>
               Friday  morning  continued  to  fire  on  the  Tajik  Interior<br>
               Ministry's special  battalion in  the settlement  of Garm some<br>
               150 kilometers east of the Tajik capital of Dushanbe.<br>
                    Early reports  say four government troops were killed and<br>
               another 14  wounded,  a  well-informed  source  in  the  Tajik<br>
               Interior Ministry told Interfax.<br>
                    No information  about  the  number  of  casualties  among<br>
               opposition troops was immediately available.<br>
                    The opposition  units, numbering  about 200  rebels,  had<br>
               also attacked  the government  force on  Thursday morning. The<br>
               attack  Friday   morning  involved  three  howitzers,  grenade<br>
               launchers and fire-arms.<br>
                    The  Tajik  government  Thursday  protested  against  the<br>
               violation of  the protocol  on the political settlement of the<br>
               situation in  the Karategin  and Tavildara areas. The protocol<br>
               was signed  by Tajik  President Emomali  Rakhmonov  and  Tajik<br>
               opposition leader  Said Abdullo  Nuri during  their meeting in<br>
               northern Afghanistan on December 11.<br>
                    The Tajik  government said  it retains  the right to take<br>
               measures  in  response  to  attacks  by  the  opposition.  The<br>
               opposition will  be responsible for all possible consequences,<br>
               the Tajik government said.<br>
                    "The government  is  still  ready  to  settle  the  armed<br>
               confrontation in  the Pamir  foothills by  peaceful  political<br>
               methods," the source in the Interior Ministry said.<br>

     TAJIK CEASEFIRE VIOLATED IN FIRST 24 HOURS. The latest Tajik <br>
     ceasefire, which came into effect at midnight on 11 December, has <br>
     already been violated in the Garm region, Russian and Western media <br>
     reported. The Tajik government complained to the UN, claiming that <br>
     opposition forces in Garm, 150 km east of Dushanbe, attacked a special <br>
     forces unit. At least two soldiers are reported dead. Another attack <br>
     by opposition forces was reported in the village of Labijar, 120 km <br>
     east of Dushanbe, but no casualty figures were given. The reports <br>
     failed to mention that in the hours leading up to the signing of the <br>
     latest ceasefire, government forces moved a brigade near the city of <br>
     Garm, which was captured by the opposition on 1 December. Meanwhile, <br>
     the opposition is denying that it was behind two bombs that went off <br>
     in Dushanbe on 12 December, one near the parliament building and the <br>
     other near the Pakistani Embassy. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     YURII BATURIN IN TAJIKISTAN. Russian Defense Council Secretary Yurii <br>
     Baturin arrived in Tajikistan on 12 December to review the ceasefire <br>
     agreement signed by Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov and Tajik <br>
     opposition leader Said Abdullo Nuri in Afghanistan on 10-11 December, <br>
     Russian media reported. High-ranking Russian officials always visit <br>
     the Central Asian nation prior to peace negotiations. All sides <br>
     involved in the Tajik conflict still agree Rakhmonov and Nuri will <br>
     meet in Moscow on 19 December to sign agreements that UN special envoy <br>
     to Tajikistan Gerd Merrem said will be even "more rewarding" than <br>
     previous settlements. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     NEW AGREEMENT ON TAJIK CEASEFIRE. Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov <br>
     and United Tajik Opposition leader Said Abdullo Nuri agreed to a <br>
     ceasefire on 11 December during their meeting in northern Afghanistan, <br>
     according to Russian and Western press. The ceasefire was due to come <br>
     into effect at midnight the same day and the two leaders will formally <br>
     sign it at a 19 December meeting in Moscow. However, government forces <br>
     were reportedly launching an assault on Garm on 11 December in an <br>
     attempt to free a special forces unit trapped in the town. NTV <br>
     reported that the opposition had suffered heavy losses in the battle. <br>
     In the Tajik capital Dushanbe, two bombs went off on 12 December <br>
     killing one person and injuring another. One of the bombs exploded <br>
     outside the Tajik Parliament, the other near the Pakistani Embassy. -- <br>

     TAJIK PRESIDENT, OPPOSITION LEADER MEET. Tajik President Imomali <br>
     Rakhmonov and United Tajik Opposition leader Said Abdullo Nuri met in <br>
     Khosdekh, Afghanistan, on 10 December, international press reported. <br>
     Few details were available on the meeting, except that the two men <br>
     agreed to meet officially in Moscow on 19 December. The press <br>
     speculated that a new ceasefire agreement will be signed at that time <br>
     as well as an agreement on the establishment of a coalition council <br>
     with representation from both the government and opposition. <br>
     Meanwhile, Red Cross representatives were allowed to see 110 <br>
     government soldiers being held by opposition forces in Komsomolabad. <br>

     TAJIK OPPOSITION LEADER ARRIVES IN KUNDUZ. United Tajik Opposition <br>
     leader Said Abdullo Nuri flew to Kunduz on 9 December, arriving one <br>
     day late for a scheduled meeting with Tajik President Imomali <br>
     Rakhmonov, international press reported. Details on Nuri's delay are <br>
     conflicting, with some reports claiming that Taliban aircraft forced <br>
     the plane down at Shindan then transferred it to Kandahar, while <br>
     others claiming that the plane had technical difficulties and <br>
     requested a landing for repairs. One thing is certain, Nuri did meet <br>
     with Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     TAJIK OPPOSITION LEADER'S PLANE FORCED DOWN. A plane taking United <br>
     Tajik Opposition (UTO) leader Said Abdullo Nuri to his scheduled 9 <br>
     December meeting with Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov in northern <br>
     Afghanistan was forced down by aircraft of the Taliban movement, <br>
     Russian and Western sources reported. Taliban sources say Nuri is a <br>
     "guest" and they will allow him to continue on to the meeting point in <br>
     Kunduz. Rakhmonov, in Dushanbe, is waiting for word of Nuri's arrival <br>
     at Kunduz before leaving for the meeting. Fighting inside Tajikistan <br>
     is at its worst since the civil war of 1992. Government forces are <br>
     reported to be assaulting Komsomolabad (135 km east of Dushanbe), <br>
     which fell to the opposition in October. Fighting is also reported in <br>
     the Tavil-Dara area (200 km east of Dushanbe) and in the village of <br>
     Chinor (60 km east of Dushanbe) near the Nurek hydro-electric plant. <br>

     TROUBLES FOR UN OBSERVERS IN TAJIKISTAN. The UN Mission of Observers <br>
     in Tajikistan (UNMOT) issued a press release on 3 December, condemning <br>
     the treatment of its people by members of the Tajik government's <br>
     military, Nezavisimaya Gazeta and RFE/RL reported. According to UNMOT, <br>
     three of its officials sent to the Garm area to report on the fighting <br>
     there were stopped by government troops at the Chorsada post where <br>
     they were physically abused and threatened with their lives. In order <br>
     to return to the Tajik capital, Dushanbe, the three had to travel <br>
     first to Kyrgyzstan. The United Tajik Opposition is cited by UN <br>
     Special Envoy to Tajikistan Gerd Merrem as being instrumental in <br>
     procuring safe passage through opposition-held territory en route to <br>
     Kyrgyzstan. The Tajik government apologized and claimed the incident <br>
     was the action of individuals and promised to investigate the matter. <br>
     UNMOT has reportedly recalled all its representatives to Dushanbe. -- <br>

     HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH BLASTS TAJIKISTAN, KYRGYZSTAN. In its seventh <br>
     annual human rights survey, the organization Human Rights Watch notes <br>
     a dramatic deterioration of democratic principles in Tajikistan and <br>
     Kyrgyzstan, RFE/RL reported on 5 December. On Kyrgyzstan, HRW pointed <br>
     to government repression of the media, suspension of freedom of speech <br>
     and association, the continued existence of residence permits and <br>
     internal passports, and the "alarming" consolidation of power by <br>
     President Askar Akayev. HRW also questioned the constitutionality of <br>
     the rescheduled presidential elections of December 1995. Tajikistan, <br>
     which has been criticized for the last five years for its record on <br>
     human rights, was described as having its "worst year" in 1996. The <br>
     report also condemned decisions by the IMF and World Bank to lend <br>
     money to Tajikistan despite the country's disregard for human rights. <br>

     TAJIK FIGHTING CONTINUES, MOVES CLOSER TO CAPITAL. An attempt by Tajik <br>
     government forces to retake the city of Garm has been repelled by <br>
     opposition forces who captured the city last week, Russian sources <br>
     report. Opposition forces used artillery and tanks to drive back <br>
     government troops. Attacks have also been reported as close as 13 <br>
     kilometers from the capital Dushanbe. A Russian helicopter came under <br>
     gun and grenade fire at Dushanbe airport on 4 December. -- Bruce <br>

     RED CROSS CALLS FOR MORE AID TO CENTRAL ASIA. The International Red <br>
     Cross representative in Central Asia, Bob McKerrow, said $21 million <br>
     will be needed in 1997 to provide adequate aid to the Central Asian <br>
     states, according to a 2 December Reuters report. Speaking at a news <br>
     conference in Almaty, McKerrow noted that Kazakstan already has cases <br>
     of malnutrition, particularly in the western regions where drought <br>
     ruined almost the entire harvest. The aggravated situations in <br>
     Afghanistan and Tajikistan are also expected to increase the number of <br>
     refugees in Central Asia. In Kyrgyzstan there are presently 30,000 <br>
     refugees, and people fleeing from the fighting in Afghanistan have <br>
     appeared in Turkmenistan. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     ANOTHER TAJIK TOWN UNDER SIEGE. The city of Garm in central Tajikistan <br>
     is the latest to fall to forces of the Tajik opposition, Russian and <br>
     Western media reported. Opposition fighters began attacking Garm on 1 <br>
     December, killing at least seven government soldiers and by nightfall <br>
     were holding some 100-150 government employees and soldiers in a local <br>
     mosque. Government aircraft and helicopters responded by bombing the <br>
     city. Fighting continued into the next morning. The fall of Garm <br>
     leaves the opposition in control of a fork in a strategic highway <br>
     leading both southeast and northeast. Supplies must now be airlifted <br>
     to government forces in Tajikabad and CIS border guards in Khorog, <br>
     Kalai-Khumb, and Ishkashim. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     TAJIK PRESIDENT, OPPOSITION LEADER TO MEET IN DECEMBER. Western <br>
     sources reported on 25 November that Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov <br>
     will meet United Tajik Opposition (UTO) leader Said Abdullo Nuri on 9 <br>
     December in northern Afghanistan. The exact location of the meeting <br>
     has not been disclosed. The meeting will lay the groundwork for a 23 <br>
     December "official" meeting in Moscow. Expectations are that an <br>
     agreement on power sharing will be signed at the Moscow meeting. <br>
     Opposition forces have moved steadily westward since early 1996 and <br>
     are now about 80 kilometers east of the capital Dushanbe. -- Bruce <br>

           TAJIK GOVT RETAKES TOWN WITH SUPPLY DEPOTS PLUNDERED BY REBELS<br>
     <br>
                    DUSHANBE, Nov  25 (Interfax)  - Tajik  government  <br>
     troops have regained control over the town of Sagirdasht, located 200 <br>
     kilometers to  the east of Dushanbe, a senior Defense Ministry<br>
     source told Interfax Monday.<br>
        Tajik rebels  had seized  the town  in  late  October  in<br>
     defiance  of  the  Tehran  cease-fire  agreement  between  the<br>
     government and the opposition, the source recalled.<br>
        Unlike  Tavildara   some  15  kilometers  to  the  north,<br>
     Sagirdasht does  not have  so much  strategic importance,  the<br>
     officer said.  However, the town had contained government food<br>
     and ammunition depots, he noted.<br>
     "This is  the only  reason why  Sagirdasht fell  into the<br>
     area of  military operations  and why  rebels fully robbed the<br>
     depots, taking  away food, clothes and ammunition," the source<br>
     said.<br>
        About 40  remaining rebels retreated from the city to the northwest <br>
     virtually  without  engagement  Sunday  evening,  he said.<br>
     "Government forces are gradually regaining control in the<br>
     Tavildara  area,   and,  what   is  noteworthy,  with  minimum<br>
     casualties," the  officer said  in comment on the situation in<br>
     the area.<br>
        "The  Defense  Ministry  does  not  have  information  on <br>
     casualties among opposition militia," he said. "Life is  returning to  <br>
     normal" in  Sagirdasht and  other areas, the  source said.  "Local <br>
     authorities,  which have been idle over the last month, are being <br>
     restored," he said.<br>

     RUSSIAN COMMANDER IN TAJIKISTAN DEMANDS ACTION ON TERRORISM. Lt.-Gen. <br>
     Viktor Zavarzin, the commander of the CIS peacekeeping forces in <br>
     Tajikistan, sent a note to Tajik law enforcement agencies expressing <br>
     his dissatisfaction at their efforts to combat attacks on the CIS <br>
     force troops, according to ITAR-TASS on 21 November. Zavarzin's <br>
     protest comes after the 19 November murder of a Tajik Defense Ministry <br>
     officer, who was Russian, the abduction on the same day of the wife of <br>
     a Russian serviceman, and the shooting of two soldiers from the 201st <br>
     Motorized Rifle Division on 20 November. All the crimes occurred in <br>
     the Tajik capital Dushanbe. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     TAJIK GOVERNMENT FORCES HOLD BACK REBEL ADVANCE. Tajik Defense <br>
     Ministry forces repelled opposition attacks on military posts in the <br>
     Khaburabad Pass on 21 November, according to Reuters and ITAR-TASS. <br>
     The pass, located 300 km east of Dushanbe, overlooks the main highway <br>
     running east from the capital. The Defense Ministry sent a protest to <br>
     the UN observer mission, stating that this and similar attacks on <br>
     Komsomolabad and in the Tavil-Dara area are a clear violation of the <br>
     Tehran ceasefire agreement signed in 1994. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     KOMSOMOLABAD FALLS TO TAJIK OPPOSITION. Tajik opposition forces took <br>
     over the strategic city of Komsomolabad, 150 km east of the capital, <br>
     Dushanbe, by 15 November without a fight, Russian media reported. <br>
     Russia's NTV reported that the city is calm and the opposition has <br>
     already replaced local officials. The opposition also controls a long <br>
     stretch of highway leading west toward Dushanbe. Only 60 km separate <br>
     government checkpoints on the outskirts of Dushanbe from opposition <br>
     checkpoints on the same road, according to NTV. Opposition fighters <br>
     are in positions only 12 km away from Dushanbe leaving the capital and <br>
     the Khatlon region to the south as the only territory in Tajikistan <br>
     under full government control. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

 TAJIK PRESIDENT LIKELY TO MAKE CONCESSIONS TO OPPOSITION<br>
<p>
               MOSCOW, Nov  12  (Interfax)  -  Tajik  President  Imamali<br>
          Rakhmonov  is   likely  to  make  concessions  to  the  allied<br>
          opposition, sources  in the  Tajikistan  National  Renaissance<br>
          Movement told Interfax Tuesday.<br>
               Former prime minister Abdumalik Abdulladzhanov chairs the<br>
          movement,  Jamshed  Khilolov  and  Abdudzhalil  Samadov,  also<br>
          former prime ministers, being his deputies.<br>
<p>
               Rakhmonov's staff  has developed a draft agreement, which<br>
          may be  signed at  his planned  meeting with  Tajik opposition<br>
          leader Said  Abdullo Nuri  in Moscow  by the  end of 1996, the<br>
          sources said.<br>
               In part,  the draft  document stipulates  that "the talks<br>
          and the  implementation of the agreements to be reached are to<br>
          be accomplished within 12 to 18 months after this agreement is<br>
          signed," they said.<br>
               "The Tajik president and the opposition leader are making<br>
          a decision  to create a commission for national reconciliation<br>
          for the above-indicated transitional period, which would enjoy<br>
          wide-spread powers,  including  executive  functions,  on  all<br>
          issues concerning  the establishment  of  peace  and  national<br>
          accord in  the country,  chiefly  on  political  and  military<br>
          issues," the draft agreement reads.<br>
               The commission  will be formed according to the principle<br>
          of "justice,  considering the  interests of  all political and<br>
          social  forces  in  the  republic,"  the  document  reads.  An<br>
          opposition representative will head the commission.<br>
               The functions  and powers of the current legislature will<br>
          be delegated  to the  president and  the commission before new<br>
          elections.<br>
               The commission  will develop  amendments and additions to<br>
          the existing  constitution and  draft  laws,  particularly  on<br>
          political  parties   and  public   associations,  mass  media,<br>
          parliamentary and presidential elections.<br>
               The  draft   agreement  also   provides  for  creating  a<br>
          government   of    national   accord   with   a   proportional<br>
          representation of  various political  parties  and  movements,<br>
          considering regional division, "especially with respect to the<br>
          power ministries and administrative bodies."<br>
               The draft  document will  declare an  amnesty "and mutual<br>
          pardon  to  all  people  engaged  in  military  and  political<br>
          confrontation since  1992 until the moment this amnesty act is<br>
          approved."<br>
               The Tajik  authorities may  still "slightly  adjust"  the<br>
          document, the sources told Interfax.<br>
               "In  this   case,  any   amendments  will   have  to   be<br>
          preliminarily  agreed  on  with  the  leaders  of  the  allied<br>
          opposition," they said.<br>
               Interfax has  not  received  confirmation  that  a  draft<br>
          agreement with the opposition has been developed in Dushanbe.<br>

           CONTINUATION OF CONFLICT WILL SPLIT TAJIKISTAN, MODERATE SAYS<br>
 <br>
                MOSCOW, Nov  12 (Interfax)  - "The  continuation  of  the<br>
           conflict in  Tajikistan will  split the country," according to<br>
           the National Renewal Movement leader Abdumalik Abdullajanov.<br>
                In an  exclusive interview  with  Interfax  the  moderate<br>
           opposition figure  said: "It  may happen  so that  the country<br>
           will be  divided into independent northern and southern areas.<br>
           It  is  clear  even  today  that  the  Tajik  authorities  and<br>
           President Emomali  Rakhmonov have  practically no control over<br>
           Gorno Badakhshan  or the  Tavildara zone  held mainly  by  the<br>
           armed opposition."<br>
                The former  prime minister  sharply criticized Rakhmonov.<br>
           "He and  his supporters  are obsessed  with keeping  power  in<br>
           their hands.  They are absolutely unmoved by the future of the<br>
           country or people," he said.<br>
                Describing the  key principles  of his movement's program<br>
           Abdullajanov said  a special  body - a national reconciliation<br>
           commission - should be set up for the transitional period with<br>
           broad power and executive functions on political matters.<br>
                He said the commission would be formed by an equal number<br>
           of representatives from every region.<br>
                During the  transitional  period  the  functions  of  the<br>
           parliament  would  be  performed  by  the  president  and  the<br>
           national reconciliation commission, Abdullajanov said.<br>
                A coalition  government  of  all  political  parties  and<br>
           public movements would be formed during the period.<br>
                The opposition  figure  described  the  current  economic<br>
           situation in the country as disastrous.<br>
                "The economy  is at  a standstill, people live in poverty<br>
           while the  leadership that  seized power by force is cynically<br>
           squandering the country," he said.<br>
                If the  situation does  not change  for the better, which<br>
           Abdullajanov strongly  doubted, he predicted a social outburst<br>
           in one or two years at the most.<br>
                He is  convinced "Rakhmonov  must reach a compromise with<br>
           the armed  opposition" and is absolutely sure no stability can<br>
           be reached without it.<br>
                "Sooner or  later, by  his own  free will  or  under  the<br>
           pressure of  circumstances President  Rakhmonov will  have  to<br>
           make concessions.  The sooner this happens, the better it will<br>
           be for the republic," Abdullajanov said.<br>

 INTER-TAJIK SETTLEMENT DISCUSSED IN MOSCOW<br>
 <br>
 MOSCOW, Nov 11 (Interfax) - Leader of the Ismaelites, Aga<br>
 Khan VI, last Sunday met in Moscow with leader of the Movement for the  <br>
 National Revival  of Tajikistan, ex-prime minister of Tajikistan Abdumalik <br>
 Abdulldzhanov.<br>
 Abdulldzhanov told  Interfax Monday  that the  talks  had<br>
 lasted for  an hour  and dealt  with a  wide range  of  issues pertaining to <br>
 the situation in Tajikistan and Afghanistan. "We came to  the conclusion  that <br>
 the  Talibs' advancement  to the northern  provinces  of  Afghanistan  may  <br>
 have  an  extremely negative impact on the situation in Tajikistan," he said.<br>
 He quoted  Aga Khan  as saying  that Russia  is playing a<br>
 special role in the settlement of the inter-Tajik conflict. He also said  that <br>
 Aga  Khan  favored  "an  increasing  role  and influence of  international <br>
 organizations,  above all the U.N. and the OSCE, in settling the Tajik crisis."<br>
 Neighboring Uzbekistan  is expected  to play a great role<br>
 in the Tajik settlement, said Abdulldzhanov.<br>
 He  said  that  the  leaders  of  the  Tajik  opposition,<br>
 including armed  opposition,  are  ready  to  sit  down  at  a negotiating <br>
 table  with the  Tajik official  authorities,  "if certain cardinal  terms, <br>
 which have been rejected by President Emomali Rakhmonov,  are fulfilled."  What <br>
 is meant here is the formation of  an interim government comprising <br>
 representatives of the opposition, political parties and public organizations, <br>
 he said.<br>

     TAJIK GOVERNMENT FORCES LAUNCH OFFENSIVE. Government forces in the <br>
     Tavil-Dara area have begun a counterattack to dislodge the opposition <br>
     from positions they captured earlier this month, Reuters and ITAR-TASS <br>
     reported on 7 November. The current objective of the government forces <br>
     is the village of Sagirdasht located about 200 km from the Tajik <br>
     capital Dushanbe. The village overlooks the main highway from Dushanbe <br>
     to Khorog and has landing areas for helicopters, which prior to its <br>
     capture, government forces had used to ferry troops and supplies to <br>
     combat areas in the mountainous east. There have been no reports yet <br>
     on casualties from either side. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     TAJIK GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION COURT NATIONAL REVIVAL MOVEMENT. Since <br>
     the start of November, both the Tajik government and opposition have <br>
     made overtures to the National Revival Movement founded last spring by <br>
     three former prime ministers. The United Tajik Opposition (UTO) <br>
     announced that the movement would be included at the next round of <br>
     peace talks, and that one UTO leader, Ali Akbar Turajonzoda, had met <br>
     with the movement's co-founder, Abdumalik Abdullajonov, in Tashkent <br>
     recently. Following this meeting, UTO leader Said Abdullo Nuri said <br>
     that cooperation with the movement was possible, according to a Voice <br>
     of Free Tajikistan radio broadcast monitored by the BBC. ITAR-TASS <br>
     reported on 5 November that President Imomali Rakhmonov met with the <br>
     other two leaders of the movement, Jamshed Karimov and Abdujalil <br>
     Samadov, after they arrived in Dushanbe on 3 November, and appointed <br>
     Karimov as a senior aide for foreign affairs. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     TWO STRATEGIC TAJIK VILLAGES FALL TO OPPOSITION. Fighters of the Tajik <br>
     opposition have seized two more villages along the road to Khorog, <br>
     Russian and Western sources reported. They attacked Sagirdasht and <br>
     Kalai-Hussein on 1 November, capturing both by 3 November. The <br>
     villages lie along the only highway leading to the Eastern city of <br>
     Khorog. More importantly, these are the last two villages of any size <br>
     on the way south to Afghanistan. Russian and Kazakstani border guards <br>
     at the Kalai- Khumb posts are now sandwiched between Tajik opposition <br>
     forces based opposite their positions in Afghanistan and behind them <br>
     in the Tavil- Dara region. The Tajik Ministry of Defense is moving <br>
     about 3,000 soldiers into position to launch a counter-offensive. -- <br>

     TAJIK OPPOSITION RELEASES 10 HOSTAGES. Ten of 35 police officers taken <br>
     prisoner by the Tajik opposition near Komsomolabad on 27 October were <br>
     released unconditionally on 1 November, according to ITAR-TASS and <br>
     RFE/RL. Opposition leader Said Abdullo Nuri said the remaining <br>
     hostages would be freed when the government removed its checkpoints <br>
     along roads in central Tajikistan, the opposition's original demand, <br>
     but added a new demand that four opposition members be freed from <br>
     government jails. -- Bruce Pannier and Abbas Djavadi<br>

 CENTRAL ASIANS AT DONOR CONFERENCE IN JAPAN. The prime ministers of Kazakstan, <br>
 Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are in Japan for a three-day conference for countries <br>
 that give aid to Central Asian states, ITAR- TASS and NTV reported. Japan was <br>
 the only country to go on record with new funding schemes for the three <br>
 countries. Kazakstan was pledged $200 million for projects ranging from <br>
 building new bridges to constructing medical centers, according to Kazak <br>
 Television monitored by the BBC. ITAR-TASS reported Tajikistan will receive <br>
 about $2.25 million in credits for construction of international airports at <br>
 Dushanbe, Khojent, and Kulyab. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

 TAJIK OPPOSITION MAKES NEW DEMANDS. The United Tajik Opposition (UTO) insists <br>
 that the National Reconciliation Council that the UTO has proposed be comprised <br>
 40% by the Movement for the Islamic Revival of Tajikistan, 40% by other <br>
 opposition groups, and just 20% by government representatives, ITAR-TASS <br>
 reported on 28 October. The next round of talks between the Tajik government <br>
 and UTO, to be held in Moscow, are not expected anytime soon, a spokesman for <br>
 the UTO said. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

 situation in Afghanistan opened in the Iranian capital Tehran on 29 October, <br>
 ITAR-TASS and IRNA reported. Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said <br>
 "the countries in the region ... are obliged to do their utmost to put a stop <br>
 to outside interference in Afghanistan's internal affairs." Representatives <br>
 from all the Central Asian CIS states except Uzbekistan were at the conference <br>
 as well as Russia, Turkey, India, and envoys from the UN and the Organization <br>
 of the Islamic Conference. Pakistan and Saudi Arabia did not attend though <br>

 TAJIK POLICEMEN TAKEN HOSTAGE. Forces of Tajik opposition field commander Mullo <br>
 Abdullo surprised two busloads of Tajik policemen on 24 October taking all 37 <br>
 of them hostage near the town of Komsomolabad, Russian and Western sources <br>
 reported. The captors demand the dismantling of all checkpoints along roads in <br>
 the Karateginskaya valley because, according to the opposition, they are a <br>
 violation of the truce signed by opposition and government commanders on 17 <br>
 September. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     LEADERS OF TURKIC-SPEAKING COUNTRIES MEET. The presidents of six <br>
     Turkic- speaking countries assembled in Tashkent on 21 October, AFP <br>
     reported. It was the fourth meeting between the presidents of <br>
     Azerbaijan, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and <br>
     Turkey. Discussion centered on trade relations: although the subject <br>
     of Afghanistan was touched on, Uzbek President Islam Karimov said the <br>
     heads of state "would not be dragged into settling political matters." <br>
     However, some time was devoted to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. <br>
     Azerbaijani President Heidar Aliev again said that he was prepared to <br>
     give maximum autonomy to the region but that "Nagorno-Karabakh will <br>
     never be independent." The presidents signed a declareiterating "their <br>
     firm and unchanging commitment to the principles of<br>
     democracy, respect for human rights and a market economy," said <br>
     Karimov. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     TALIBAN EXTENDING OLIVE BRANCH? A spokesman for the Taliban movement <br>
     claims that Central Asia has nothing to fear from the group that now <br>
     controls most of Afghanistan, Rusian Public TV (ORT) reported on 7 <br>
     October. The acting foreign minister of the Taliban, Muhammed Ghous, <br>
     called upon the UN "to convince Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakstan, and <br>
     Kyrgyzstan not to meddle in Afghanistan's internal affairs and the <br>
     Taliban for their part will not interfere in the affairs of other <br>
     countries." A radio broadcast originating in Pakistan on 6 October <br>
     announced that the Taliban would soon send representatives to the <br>
     Central Asian states as a demonstration of the group's "brotherly <br>
     love" for the region, Radio Rossii reported on 6 October. However, <br>
     Ghous reportedly said "we do not want Russia to forget the lesson they <br>
     were taught here," referring to the Soviet military campaign in <br>
     Afghanistan in the 1980s. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     ALMATY PREPARES FOR CIS SUMMIT. On 4 October Russian and Central Asian <br>
     leaders will gather in Almaty to discuss the implications of the <br>
     Taliban victories in Afghanistan, along with other issues. <br>
     Turkmenistan announced that it would not attend the Almaty summit due <br>
     to its policy of "positive neutrality," Russian and Western media <br>
     reported on 3 October. Kazakstani Security Council chief Baltash <br>
     Tursumbayev said Russian Security Council Secretary Aleksandr Lebed <br>
     has exaggerated the threat posed to Central Asia by Taliban successes <br>
     in Afghanistan, Nezavisimaya gazeta and RTR reported on 3 October. <br>
     Tursumbayev termed Lebed's 1 October assertion that the Taliban <br>
     coveted territory in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, including Bukhara, as <br>
     "rash and lacking foundation." -- Lowell Bezanis and Bruce Pannier<br>

     TAJIKISTAN ASKS FOR AID. Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov has <br>
     requested additional support for his country in light of recent events <br>
     in Afghanistan and it appears that he will get it, ITAR-TASS reported. <br>
     The head of the Federal Border Guards Service, Gen. Andrei Nikolaev, <br>
     says he has already made proposals to the Russian leadership that are <br>
     scheduled to be discussed at the CIS summit in Almaty. Nikolaev noted <br>
     that extra measures had already been taken this summer in response to <br>
     a build up of Tajik opposition forces along the Tajik-Afghan border. <br>
     Nikolaev called upon Kazakstan and Kyrgyzstan to take a more active <br>
     role in defending this border, pointing out that each country has only <br>
     500 men guarding the border while Russia has around 4,500. -- Bruce <br>

     TAJIKISTAN IMPACTED BY TURMOIL IN AFGHANISTAN. Recent events in <br>
     Afghanistan have started a flurry of diplomatic and military activity <br>
     in Central Asia, particularly in Tajikistan. Tajik President Imomali <br>
     Rakhmonov sent an appeal to the UN and "to world powers" asking for a <br>
     political settlement in Afghanistan, ITAR-TASS reported on 30 <br>
     September. Along the Tajik-Afghan border the situation remains tense. <br>
     Russian sources on 1 October reported the deaths of four more Russian <br>
     border guards in fighting near Kalai-Khumb. Radio Rossii, also on 1 <br>
     October, reported that the estimated 300 fighters of the Tajik <br>
     opposition, massed in Afghanistan opposite border guard positions, <br>
     have been joined by "bands of Afghan Mojahedin" and now number 1,500. <br>

DUSHANBE, October 1 (Itar-Tass) -- The latest aggravation of the situation<br>
on the Tajik-Afghan border and the developments ensuing from the Taliban<br>
militia's seizure of Kabul and further advances towards northern Afghanistan<br>
and its borders with Tajikistan were discussed at a meeting between Tajik<br>
President Emomali Rakhmonov and commander of the CIS collective peacekeeping<br>
forces general Viktor Zavarzin here today, informed sources told Itar-Tass<br>
on Tuesday.<br>
   A spokesman for the command of the CIS collective peacekeeping forces<br>
subsequently told Itar-Tass that the command was seriously concerned over<br>
the mounting tension in the border area. He said that in view of the growing<br>
tension in the area and in keeping with its mandate, the CIS collective<br>
peacekeeping forces were prepared to give all necessary support to the<br>
Russian border troops deployed there, if threat to peace and stability kept<br>
mounting.<br>
   Military sources points in particular to the situation in the Kalaikhum<br>
sector of the border, where the Afghanistan-based Tajik rebels had been<br>
increasingly more active lately, launching repeated attempts at forcing<br>
their way into Tajikistan for almost a week and opening fire at anything<br>
moving on the other side of the border. Four Russian border troops and<br>
pilots have died and four have been wounded in gunfire exchanges with the<br>
Tajik opposition militants stationed in the Afghan territory adjacent on the<br>
Kalaikhum sector of the Tajik-Afghan border, the sources told Itar-Tass. One<br>
group of militants made its way into Tajikistan on September 27 and has<br>
since been attacking motor vehicles on the roads of the Kalaikhum area. The<br>
militants have taken five hostages, including a driver who was in service<br>
with the Russian border troops under a contract.<br>
   In the same area, two Russian crew died of wounds sustained when their<br>
combat helicopter came under fire from the territory of Afghanistan at the<br>
Kalaikhum section of the Tajik-Afghan border on Sunday. Captains Igor Budai<br>
and Valery Stovba were wounded and the helicopter was dangerously damaged by<br>
fire from an anti-aircraft machine-gun and small arms when it was on a<br>
reconnaissance mission over the border. The crew commander succeeded in<br>
bringing the helicopter safely to land at the base but the two men's wounds<br>
proved to be fatal.<br>
   All this called for adequate response on the part of the Russian border<br>
troops and the CIS collective peacekeeping forces.<br>
   In this context the latest developments in Afghanistan were seen as<br>
increasingly disturbing, according to the spokesman who said it was not<br>
ruled out that the hostilities between the Taleban militia and the Afghan<br>
government forces could spread as far as Tajikistan's northern borders<br>
further aggravating the situation there.<br>
   Concerted efforts on the part of all parties concerned, including the<br>
international community and the leading nations of the world, are needed to<br>
ensure peace and stability in the region, the spokesman said. The call for<br>
peace talks should come from the United Nations and it must be backed by the<br>
leading states of the world and the troubled region, including Tajikistan,<br>
the spokesman said.<br>
   For their part, the Tajik government and its power ministries were doing<br>
everything in their power to counter efforts aiming to disrupt progress<br>
towards the settlement, including vicious allegations and propaganda ploys<br>
on the part of the forces opposed to the settlement.<br>
   Tajik opposition forces in Afghan territory were clearly preparing to<br>
step up their activity, including in retaliation for the alleged bombardment<br>
of their positions by Tajik government planes.<br>
   Thus, Tajikistan's Defense Ministry categorically denied media reports<br>
alleging that its warplanes had bombarded the villages of Guram and<br>
Dashti-Sher in the mountainous Tavildara region and said in a statement<br>
released here today that the forces opposed to peace and stability in<br>
Tajikistan were indisputably behind the allegations about ar strikes.<br>
   The Ministry declared that the Tajik army's air wing had made no combat<br>
sorties since September 13, and no unidentified planes had been observed<br>
flying over the region.<br>
   The Defense Ministry said it fully backed all efforts to settle the<br>
Tajik-Tajik conflict and had taken part in the preceding truce negotiations<br>
between the Tajik government and the armed opposition in the Garm region for<br>
the purpose.<br>
   The Ministry welcomed the first signs of the political settlement in the<br>
Pamir mountain region of Tavildara as it had contributed jointly with the<br>
leaders of Tajikistan's other power ministries to the achievement of a<br>
ceasefire agreement with rebel commander Mirzo Zieyev.<br>
   Under the accord, ceasefire will be observed in the Tavildara region<br>
ahead of the beginning of the peace talks due to open on October 3 and<br>
expected to yield a truce protocol similar to that signed during the Garm<br>
talks to provide leeway for Tajik-Tajik settlement dialogue.<br>

     CENTRAL ASIA VOICES CONCERN OVER KABUL'S FALL. The Tajik government on <br>
     30 September expressed its concern that the recent events in Kabul <br>
     will have a negative impact on efforts to secure the Tajik-Afghan <br>
     border, Russian media reported. Also on 30 September, the Kazakstani <br>
     Foreign Ministry called on the UN to take urgent measures to end the <br>
     bloodshed in Afghanistan, warning that economic collapse and political <br>
     instability there could threaten the stability of Central Asia, <br>
     ITAR-TASS reported. -- Lowell Bezanis and Bruce Pannier<br>

     TAJIKISTAN: PEACE IN THE EAST, FIGHTING IN THE WEST. RFE/RL reported <br>
     on 30 September that, with the truce agreement along Tajikistan's <br>
     northern highway still holding, a new peace agreement has been worked <br>
     out between the Tajik government and opposition guaranteeing that the <br>
     southern highway will be open to vehicles. Tensions along the <br>
     Tajik-Afghan border remain high following the downing of a Russian <br>
     helicopter on 29 September by fire from the Afghan side of the border. <br>
     Meanwhile, in the western Tajik town of Tursun Zade, fighting is <br>
     reported between two local groups vying for control of the town. <br>
     Ibodullo Baimatov, who captured the town by force in January 1996, is <br>
     battling a former ally known only as Kadyrkul, Pravda reported on 28 <br>
     September. Government troops sent to the area are openly supporting <br>
     Kadyrkul. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     FIGHTING ERUPTS ALONG TAJIK-AFGHAN BORDER. Russian border guards have <br>
     repelled an attempt by 300 opposition fighters to cross over from <br>
     Afghanistan into Tajikistan, Russian and Western media reported. The <br>
     fighting began on 27 September when opposition groups south of the <br>
     Kalai-Khumb border posts tried to infiltrate Tajikistan. The <br>
     opposition forces were largely unsuccessful in their attempts to <br>
     penetrate the border, but ITAR-TASS and Reuters reported that some <br>
     managed to enter Tajikistan. As of 29 September, the border guards had <br>
     pushed them some 10 km back into Afghanistan. One opposition leader, <br>
     Ali Akbar Turajonzoda, denied that his side had started the trouble, <br>
     saying "in view of the uncertain situation in Afghanistan, it's not in <br>
     our interests to provoke the enemy." -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     PRIMAKOV: ISLAM IS NOT "THE ENEMY OF WORLD CIVILIZATION." In an <br>
     article in Nezavisimaya Gazeta of 18 September, Foreign Minister <br>
     Yevgenii Primakov distinguished between "Islamic extremism" and <br>
     "Islamic fundamentalism." Primakov argues that fundamentalism is a <br>
     natural response to historical developments, such as the former <br>
     persecution of Islam. "Islamic extremism," which he defines as the use <br>
     of force to change state borders, he regards as unacceptable. <br>
     Primakov, formerly a scholar of the Middle East, is thus trying to <br>
     justify Moscow's role in Tajikistan and Chechnya, while signaling that <br>
     it wants friendly relations with the Islamic world and with the 17 <br>
     million Muslims who live inside Russia. -- Peter Rutland<br>

     commander of the Russian border troops, Lt.- Gen. Pavel Tarasenko, and <br>
     the commander of Afghanistan's 6th Army Corps., Col.-Gen. Najmuddin, <br>
     to establish a 25-kilometer buffer zone in Afghanistan's Shungan <br>
     province, a move aimed at stemming Tajik opposition infiltration from <br>
     Afghanistan. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     CEASEFIRE IN KARATEGIN VALLEY. Tajik government officials and <br>
     opposition field commanders agreed to a ceasefire in the Karategin <br>
     valley on 16 September, Western and Russian news agencies reported. <br>
     The agreement appears to stipulate that checkpoints established by <br>
     both sides are to be lifted in Garm, Jirgatal and Tajikabad, thereby <br>
     permitting transit on the solitary artery linking the country's <br>
     capital with the Pamirs and Kyrgyzstan. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     RAHKMONOV IN CHINA. The presidents of Tajikistan and China, Immomali <br>
     Rakhmonov and Jiang Zemin, signed a series of bilateral cooperation <br>
     agreements in Beijing on 16 September, AFP reported. The accords <br>
     appear to be mainly symbolic and include one on environmental <br>
     protection and academic exchanges, and another on judicial <br>

     COUNCIL OF CIS BORDER FORCES MEETS IN TBILISI. The commanders of the <br>
     CIS border guard services gathered in Tbilisi to discuss several <br>
     agreements aimed at closer cooperation among their forces, including a <br>
     declaration of demarcation and external border protection principles, <br>
     Russian and Western agencies reported on 12 September. Azerbaijan, <br>
     Georgia, and Turkmenistan did not sign part of the package, including <br>
     the declaration, and Moldova, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan did not attend <br>
     the meeting at all, NTV reported on 12 September. Special attention <br>
     was paid to extending the 22 January 1993 CIS agreement "On measures <br>
     to stabilize the situation on the state border between Tajikistan and <br>
     Afghanistan" until 1997. Speaking after his meeting with Georgian <br>
     President Eduard Shevardnadze, Russian Federal Border Service Director <br>
     Andrei Nikolaev denied that Russian-Georgian relations had worsened <br>
     and noted that Russia pays for 60% of Georgia's external border <br>
     patrols. -- Elin Suleymanov<br>

     DRUG SEIZURES IN GORNO-BADAKHSHAN INCREASE. About 3 metric tons of <br>
     narcotic substances, including raw opium and heroin, have been seized <br>
     in the district of Gorno-Badakhshan since early 1996, ITAR-TASS <br>
     reported on 9 September. The agency, citing a top federal border guard <br>
     officer in Tajikistan, also reported that two drug processing plants <br>
     (likely for converting raw opium into morphine base) are operating in <br>
     Afghan Badakhshan at present. If true, the figures cited would <br>
     represent a significant increase on the seizures made in 1995, which <br>
     totaled 1,749 kg according to a 14 August Segodnya report. -- Lowell <br>

     TAJIK OPPOSITION SEIZES DJIR-GATAL. Rebel units led by a commander <br>
     identified only as Akhmadbek on 7 September seized the town of <br>
     Djirgatal, 280 km northeast of Dushanbe, and killed two Tajik militia <br>
     members, Russian and Western agencies reported. The operation appears <br>
     to have been staged to coincide with the republic's fifth anniversary <br>
     of independence on 9 September. The 300-400 rebels disarmed and <br>
     expelled 46 Tajik militiamen to Kyrgyzstan across the border. The UN <br>
     envoy in Tajikistan, Gerd Merrem, issued a letter of protest on 8 <br>
     September urging an immediate cessation of hostilities in accordance <br>
     with the existing ceasefire agreement. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     strengthening the hand of its border troops in Tajikistan in order to <br>
     face down some 1,000 armed Tajik rebels who are reportedly ready to <br>
     enter Tajikistan from Afghanistan. The presidents of Kyrgyzstan and <br>
     Kazakstan have both voiced their concern over the increase in tension <br>
     along the border and have called on the Tajik government and <br>
     opposition to resolve the conflict. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     RUSSIA, TAJIKISTAN GIVEN OBSERVER STATUS IN CENTRAL ASIAN UNION. The <br>
     presidents of Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan met in Almaty on <br>
     23 August to discuss the formation of a common economic space, <br>
     ITAR-TASS and RFE/RL reported. The three signed agreements approving <br>
     the program for 1996-1997 and amending constituent documents of the <br>
     Central Asian Bank for Cooperation and Development (CABCD), which was <br>
     established in 1994. One of the agreements envisions the creation of a <br>
     single economic space among the three countries by 1998. Uzbekistan <br>
     consented to giving the CABCD access to its domestic market in order <br>
     to facilitate operations in Uzbek currency. At the same meeting, <br>
     Russia and Tajikistan were granted observer status in the Central <br>
     Asian Union. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN TAJIKISTAN? Military sources in Dushanbe claim <br>
     government troops in central Tajikistan have consolidated and expanded <br>
     their positions, freeing a stretch of road northwest of the town of <br>
     Tavil-Dara, ITAR-TASS reported on 28 August. Government forces retook <br>
     Tavil-Dara on 23 August but sources in Dushanbe say the town is <br>
     deserted after three months of fighting in the area. The opposition's <br>
     Radio Voice of Free Tajikistan reported on 28 August that opposition <br>
     fighters hold the northern road from Faizabad, 70 kilometers east of <br>
     Dushanbe, to Jirgatal, 80 kilometers from the Kyrgyz border. The <br>
     report admitted that opposition fighters held the road only <br>
     "partially" during the daytime but "completely at night." The report <br>
     also claimed government forces could only reach the Tavil-Dara area <br>
     via a southern route through Kulyab and the Karnak Pass. -- Bruce <br>

     KILLERS OF TAJIK JOURNALIST RECEIVE DEATH SENTENCE. Abdunabi Boronov <br>
     and Nurali Janjolov were sentenced to death on 21 August by <br>
     Tajikistan's Supreme Court, according to the Tajik opposition's Radio <br>
     Voice of Free Tajikistan monitored by the BBC. The two men were found <br>
     guilty of killing Tajik journalist and member of parliament Zayniddin <br>
     Muhiddinov on 13 February 1995, the day after the second round of <br>
     elections to the Tajik parliament. Blame for Muhiddinov's murder was <br>
     attributed to the Tajik opposition which boycotted the elections; <br>
     however, according to the radio broadcast, the two killers were <br>
     members of the paramilitary Popular Front, which was formed during the <br>
     Tajik civil war and helped bring the neo-communist government to power <br>
     in 1992. It is the first time in four years that someone has been <br>
     convicted for killing a journalist. A total of 40 journalists have <br>
     been murdered in that time. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     ATTACK REPORTED 100 KM FROM DUSHANBE. A convoy of Tajik government <br>
     soldiers was ambushed on the road leading to the Tavil-Dara area on 24 <br>
     August, ITAR-TASS reported. One soldier was killed and four wounded <br>
     when elements of the Tajik opposition opened fire on the convoy near <br>
     the town of Chorsada, 100 kilometers northeast of the capital <br>
     Dushanbe. The Russian newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda speculated in its 23 <br>
     August issue that the opposition is attempting to gain control over <br>
     the mountainous regions of Tajikistan and split the country. <br>
     Meanwhile, on the diplomatic front, the opposition's Radio Voice of <br>
     Free Tajikistan dismissed an offer last week by Tajik Foreign Minister <br>
     Talbak Nazarov to include members of the opposition in the government. <br>
     "Such statements by the leaders of the regime are made on the advice <br>
     of Moscow," the radio said. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     TAJIKISTAN'S NEIGHBORS WORRIED ABOUT SITUATION. Although ITAR-TASS <br>
     reported on 23 August that Tavil-Dara has been recaptured by Tajik <br>
     government troops, officials from Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan <br>
     have met to discuss the Tajik conflict. The presidents of the three <br>
     countries met in Almaty on 24 August to discuss economic cooperation <br>
     and the creation of a common economic space by the end of 1997, <br>
     according to ITAR-TASS and RFE/RL. Prior to the meeting, Kazakstani <br>
     President Nursultan Nazarbayev met with his Tajik counterpart Imomali <br>
     Rakhmonov to emphasize the need for a peaceful solution to the <br>
     conflict. Nazarbayev also sent letters to United Tajik Opposition <br>
     leader Said Abdullo Nuri and Afghan President Burhanaddin Rabbani <br>
     expressing the same. There is speculation Nazarbayev warned Nuri and <br>
     Rabbani that Kazakstan will not remain idle should the situation in <br>
     Tajikistan worsen. -- Bruce Pannier, OMRI.<br>

     FOREIGN DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITY AROUND TAJIKISTAN. With a new outbreak of <br>
     fighting reportedly in progress in the Tavil-Dara region, <br>
     representatives of other interested countries have stepped up their <br>
     efforts to achieve some resolution to the problems in Tajikistan. <br>
     Officials of the Russian and Afghan border commands met on 22 August <br>
     in the Tajik village of Tem, close to Khorog, to discuss means of <br>
     stabilizing the area along the Tajik-Afghan border, ITAR-TASS <br>
     reported. Representatives of the two countries agreed on sharing <br>
     information on border violations and on the creation of a border <br>
     security zone stretching 2-5 kilometers south into Afghanistan. UN <br>
     envoy to Tajikistan Gerd Merrem was in Iran, where several United <br>
     Tajik Opposition leaders live, on 22 August to enlist the aid of <br>
     Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, according to RFE/RL. Iran <br>
     has played a constructive role in bringing the Tajik government and <br>
     opposition to the peace table since the conflict began in 1992. -- <br>

     security zone stretching 2-5 kilometers south into Afghanistan. UN <br>
     envoy to Tajikistan Gerd Merrem was in Iran, where several United <br>
     Tajik Opposition leaders live, on 22 August to enlist the aid of <br>
     Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, according to RFE/RL. Iran <br>
     has played a constructive role in bringing the Tajik government and <br>
     opposition to the peace table since the conflict began in 1992. -- <br>

     NO EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS BETWEEN TAJIK FACTIONS. The International <br>
     Committee of the Red Cross has expressed regret that neither the Tajik <br>
     government nor the Tajik opposition has fulfilled its promise to trade <br>
     prisoners, ITAR-TASS reported on 21 August. Under the terms of the <br>
     Ashgabat agreement, signed on 20 July, exchanges of those held by the <br>
     two sides should have been completed by 20 August, but as of 21 August <br>
     neither side had even presented a list of detained persons to the <br>
     ICRC. Meanwhile, Tajik Foreign Minister Talbak Nazarov met with <br>
     Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov on 21 August in <br>
     Moscow and repeated the Tajik government's willingness to settle the <br>
     Tajik conflict by peaceful means. According to the ITAR-TASS report, <br>
     Nazarov said the Tajik government would "agree to give the opposition <br>
     seats in the apparatus of the president, the government, and all <br>
     structures of management from rural regions to the center." -- Bruce <br>
     Pannier, OMRI<br>

     TAJIKISTAN SAID TO BE ON VERGE OF COLLAPSE. The Russian newspaper <br>
     Segodnya on 16 August reported Tajikistan as being on the verge of <br>
     collapse. The article claimed the Tajik economy is in ruins due to <br>
     corruption and the emigration of both the Russian and local <br>
     population, which has drained Tajikistan of qualified specialists. It <br>
     also said that the Tajik government is not interested in a peaceful <br>
     solution to the conflict with religious and political opponents, and <br>
     that despite trade agreements with Russia only 6% of Tajikistan's <br>
     goods go there, the bulk of the rest going to Western countries. The <br>
     article also charged that paramilitary formations from the Popular <br>
     Front, which helped the present government come to power in 1992, have <br>
     formed criminal bands which virtually occupy Dushanbe, and that half <br>
     of the Tajik militia are former criminals, the paper said. -- Bruce <br>

     KAMILOV IN NEW DELHI. Uzbek Foreign Minister Abdulaziz Kamilov held <br>
     talks with Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda in New Delhi on 21 <br>
     August, ITAR-TASS reported the same day. The report emphasized that <br>
     New Delhi and Tashkent's positions coincide on key regional issues, <br>
     particularly the need to find a peaceful resolution of the civil war <br>
     in Afghanistan. Both also stressed their commitment to fighting all <br>
     forms of international terrorism, including what was termed religious <br>
     extremism, and to further enhance bilateral ties. Trade between India <br>
     and Uzbekistan reportedly reached $20 million in 1995. -- Lowell <br>

     FBI IN TRANSCAUCASUS AND CENTRAL ASIA. The U.S. Federal Bureau of <br>
     Investigation plans to double it overseas offices from 23 to 46 over a <br>
     four-year period, AFP reported on 20 August. Among other countries, <br>
     the agency plans to establish a presence in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, <br>
     and Georgia in 1998. This is part of the FBI's effort to create a <br>
     "first line of defense" or early warning system to cope with what it <br>
     considers to be the growing internationalization of crime and crime <br>
     threats to the U.S. The report detailing these plans stressed that the <br>
     agency, whose mission has been confined to domestic law enforcement <br>
     and counter-intelligence, would not be engaged in espionage but would <br>
     liaise with its foreign counterparts. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     KYRGYZSTAN SEEKS TAJIK COOPERATION IN REFUGEE PROBLEM. The Kyrgyz <br>
     government has asked Tajik authorities to speed up the repatriation of <br>
     Tajik refugees in Kyrgyzstan, ITAR-TASS reported on 19 August. Kyrgyz <br>
     Minister of Labor and Social Security Zafar Khakimov stated there are <br>
     15,000 Tajik refugees registered in Kyrgyzstan, mainly in the Osh and <br>
     Jalalabad areas. Khakimov said the concentration of Tajik refugees in <br>
     Kyrgyzstan's southern regions was creating tensions, specifically in <br>
     the Betken district, an area already possessing a Tajik majority and <br>
     still claimed by Dushanbe as belonging to Tajikistan. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     Tajikistan: Clashes Reported Between Rival Militias<br>
     <br>
     Dushanbe, 16 August 1996 (RFE/RL) - Recurring clashes between rival <br>
     militias have been reported in western Tajikistan. <br>
     <br>
     RFE/RL's Tajikistan Broadcast Service has received reports this week <br>
     of armed clashes and hostage-taking from that region. <br>
     <br>
     One of the focal points of the clashes is Tursunzade, one of the sites <br>
     of recent rebellions by local militia leaders against the government. <br>
     The<br>
     government fulfilled several demands of rebellion leaders, including <br>
     changes in the government, and named one of the rebellion leaders,<br>
     Habib Nasrulloen, to a top government post. <br>
     <br>
     Two of Nasrulloen's sons were reported to be among those kidnapped and <br>
     held for ransom this week. But they were freed by government<br>
     security forces. <br>
     <br>
     Authorities in Dushanbe have been meeting this week to try to ease <br>
     tensions in western Tajikistan. <br>

     Russian Soldier Killed, Two Wounded in Tajikistan <br>
     <br>
        MOSCOW -- A Russian servicemen died and eight people were injured <br>
     in two bomb explosions in the Tajik capital Dushanbe on Thursday, <br>
     Interfax news agency said. It quoted the press office of the Russian <br>
     border guard force in Dushanbe as saying the first blast destroyed a <br>
     military truck carrying 12 servicemen to  work, killing one of them <br>
     and wounding two more. A Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman strongly <br>
     condemned the attack, and said it reflects the unstable situation in <br>
     the country, reported RIA news agency. Another explosion at about 1:00 <br>
     p.m. in a central cafe injured six people, two of them seriously. RIA <br>
     reported that the building was less than 100 meters (yards) from the <br>
     Tajikistan government building. It was not clear whether the blasts <br>
     were connected and no one has claimed responsibility. Interfax said <br>
     the first blast was caused by a remote-controlled explosive device <br>
     equivalent to 1 kilogram (2.5 pounds) of TNT.<br>
     <br>
        Under an intergovernmental agreement, Russia helps guard the uneasy <br>
     border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan, where Tajikistan's Islamic <br>
     opposition took refuge after defeat in a bloody civil war in 1992. <br>
     Dozens of Russian border guards in Dushanbe have been killed and in <br>
     attacks believed to have been staged by the rebels. None of the <br>
     attacks has been investigated and Moscow has criticized the Dushanbe <br>
     government for its inability to protect the Russian servicemen. <br>

     . . . AND TAJIKISTAN. The head of the IMF mission to Tajikistan, Peter <br>
     Keller, said on 13 August that the IMF is satisfied with the course of <br>
     economic reforms in the Central Asian country, ITAR-TASS and RFE/RL <br>
     reported. Having reviewed Tajikistan's progress in the first seven <br>
     months of 1996, Keller pointed to the decline in inflation (0.5% in <br>
     May) and stable rate of the Tajik ruble against the dollar as signs of <br>
     improvement in Tajikistan's economy. Keller also noted that Tajikistan <br>
     has been adhering to the IMF's debt-servicing recommendations. The IMF <br>
     representative said the favorable economic climate in Tajikistan will <br>
     make it possible for the IMF to back the country when the issue of a <br>
     preferential credit worth $50 million comes up at a meeting of the <br>
     World Bank's council of directors on 12 September. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     SHOOT-OUT IN WEST TAJIKISTAN. Seven people died and six people were <br>
     wounded in a 10 August gunfight that broke out between rival gangs in <br>
     the western Tajik town of Tursun Zade, Reuters reported. Officials in <br>
     Tursun Zade stressed that the shoot-out was an isolated incident that <br>
     had no political implications. An armed revolt took place in the town <br>
     in late January. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     UZBEK GAS-CHEMICALS COMPLEX. A foreign consortium will help develop a <br>
     chemical complex, with an estimated value of $1 billion, in <br>
     Uzbekistan's Kashgadarya province, according to a 6 January report in <br>
     Rossiiskaya Gazeta monitored by the BBC. The paper, citing sources in <br>
     Uzbekneftgaz, noted the complex will be built by a consortium <br>
     comprising three subsidiaries of the Swiss-Swedish ABB group, Japan's <br>
     Mitsui, and Nissho Iwai. The complex at the Shurtan gas-condensate <br>
     field is to produce 125,000 metric tons of polyethelene, 137,000 <br>
     metric tons of liquefied gas, and 37,000 metric tons of unstable <br>
     condensate. It is estimated $600 million will be spent on the <br>
     technological side of the project and $400 million on construction to <br>
     be carried out by Uzbek contractors. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     JAPANESE FIRMS SIGN UP WITH UZBEKISTAN FOR TEXTILE PROJECTS<br>
     <br>
     TASHKENT, Dec  31 (Interfax) - Japan's Marubeni firm will<br>
     carry out  a turnkey  upgrade project  for Uzbekistan's  major textile <br>
     company  -  the  Fergana  textile  complex,  a  senior representative  <br>
     of    the   Uzbeklegprom   textile   industry association told <br>
     Interfax.<br>
        The textile  complex, located  in Fergana region, will be<br>
     upgraded  in  line  with  a  corresponding  agreement  between <br>
     Uzbeklegprom and  Marubeni signed  during a  Uzbek  government <br>
     delegation's recent  visit to Japan, Arkady Popovsky said. The Uzbek <br>
     delegation was led by Prime Minister Utkir Sultanov.<br>
     The project  envisages upgrading the spinning and weaving<br>
     sections  of   the  Fergana  textile  complex.  The  complex's <br>
     capacity will rise 1.5-fold to 9,500 tonnes of cotton yarn and 30 <br>
     million running meters of raw fabric annually.<br>
     The Uzbek  side estimates  the project's preliminary cost<br>
     at $80  million. The  project will  be financed  out of a loan from <br>
     Japan's  EX-IM Bank,  which will  cover some  85% of  the project's <br>
     cost, and Marubeni's loan which will cover about 15% of expenses.<br>
     In Japan,  the Uzbeklegprom  association  also  signed  a<br>
     protocol of  intent to  create two textile joint ventures with Japan's <br>
     Mitsubishi.  The  projects  between  Uzbeklegprom  and Mitsubishi cost <br>
     a total  of about  $100 million.  A tentative agreement has been <br>
     reached that the Uzbek side will have a 49% stake in  both ventures. <br>
     Besides Mitsubishi, the two ventures' foreign founders will also <br>
     include Turkey's Bursel.<br>
        Investments in  Uzbekistan's light  industry are  rising,<br>
     Uzbeklegprom said.  Early estimates say investments will reach $290 <br>
     million  in 1996-1997  compared with $30 million in 1995. Uzbeklegprom <br>
     enterprises  will be  able to export $250 million worth of products in <br>
     1998 compared with $13 million in 1995.<br>

     LAW ON POLITICAL PARTIES IN UZBEKISTAN. Uzbekistan's law on political <br>
     parties came into force on 7 January, according to Uzbek media <br>
     monitored by the BBC. The law prohibits parties based on ethnic or <br>
     religious lines and those advocating war or subversion of the <br>
     constitutional order. Prospective parties must submit details of at <br>
     least 5,000 members spread over eight provinces. Applications for <br>
     registering a party are to be directed to the Justice Ministry and the <br>
     Supreme Court has the right to suspend or ban them if they are found <br>
     guilty of persistent legal violations. Parties have the right to take <br>
     part in elections, publish newspapers, and establish parliamentary and <br>
     local groups. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     STRENGTH OVER JUSTICE IN UZBEKISTAN. A coat of arms for Uzbekistan's <br>
     capital, Tashkent, was issued on 4 January, ITAR-TASS reported the <br>
     same day. The emblem's components are an open gate topped by an <br>
     oriental dome on a background of a mountain and rivers framed by <br>
     flowers, a grape vine and a plane tree in blossom. Encircling all of <br>
     this are the words "In Strength is Justice" [Kuch Adolatadir], a <br>
     mis-translation of the words "Rasti Rusti" [In Justice is Strength] <br>
     from Firdausi's Persian epic The Book of Kings [Shah Namah]. Since the <br>
     late October celebration of the birth of Tamerlane, the improperly <br>
     rendered text has increasingly been associated with him and is to be <br>
     found on numerous billboards, the wall of a museum erected to lionize <br>
     the great conqueror-builder, as well as the star of Samarkand state <br>
     medal in Uzbekistan. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     KYRGYZ PRESIDENT IN UZBEKISTAN. Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev met his <br>
     Uzbek counterpart, Islam Karimov, during a 24-25 December visit to <br>
     Tashkent, ITAR-TASS and RFE/RL reported. The two presidents signed a <br>
     free trade agreement and discussed the construction of a rail line <br>
     that would link Uzbekistan to China via Kyrgyzstan. Uzbekistan agreed <br>
     to provide Kyrgyzstan with natural gas at a preferred rate and <br>
     Kyrgyzstan will reciprocate by delivering electricity from the Naryn <br>
     hydro-electric complex. Presidential spokesman Kanybek Imanaliyev <br>
     noted that bilateral trade has increased four times to reach $200 <br>
     million. At Karimov's request, the two leaders signed a treaty that <br>
     included a reference to the "eternal friendship" between the <br>
     neighboring states. -- Bruce Pannier and Naryn Idinov<br>

     UN WORKERS TAKEN HOSTAGE IN TAJIKISTAN. A group led by Rezvon Sadirov <br>
     freed sixteen hostages within 24 hours of taking them after their <br>
     demands were met on 21 December, Western and Russian press reported. <br>
     Sadirov had threatened to kill the hostages, including seven UN <br>
     observers, unless his brother and others held by the opposition were <br>
     released. He also claimed his group had planted 30 bombs in Dushanbe, <br>
     the capital, and would explode them if his demands were not met. <br>
     Sadirov, a former defense minister for the Tajik opposition, was <br>
     demoted in 1995 and joined government forces last month. -- Bruce <br>

     UZBEK PARLIAMENT ADOPTS 1997 BUDGET. The Uzbek parliament on 27 <br>
     December approved the state budget for 1997, according to ITAR-TASS. <br>
     The budget deficit for 1997 is set at 26.8 billion som ($515 million), <br>
     or 3% of GDP. Revenue will be 124 billion som and expenditure 150 <br>
     billion. Uzbek President Islam Karimov claims annual inflation will <br>
     drop from 60% in 1996 to below 27% in 1997. At a conference of <br>
     journalists and diplomats in Tashkent on 27 December, Karimov observed <br>
     that industrial output had risen by 6% while foreign trade turnover <br>
     was at $8.3 billion, an increase of 40% from 1995. Uzbekistan turned <br>
     out 60 metric tons of gold in 1996 and its gold and hard currency <br>
     reserves grew to $1.5 billion. He also said about 47% of budget <br>
     revenue in 1996 went to social programs and a mere 4.3% was spent on <br>
     defense. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     UZBEK PRESIDENT SUMS UP ECONOMIC RESULTS OF 1996<br>
     <br>
     TASHKENT, Dec  27 (Interfax)  - The annual inflation rate<br>
     in Uzbekistan  totalled 60%  in 1996,  Uzbek  President  Islam Karimov <br>
     told diplomats and journalists in Tashkent Friday.<br>
     Karimov hoped  that next  year inflation  would be  below<br>
     27%. He  estimated investments in the Uzbek economy in 1996 at $6 <br>
     billion.<br>
        Industrial  output   rose  by  6%,  while  foreign  trade<br>
     turnover stood  at $8.3  billion, 40%  higher than in 1995, he said. <br>
     The  country harvested 3.45 million tonnes of raw cotton this year, he <br>
     said.<br>
        As much  as 47%  of  budget  revenue  in  1996  was  made<br>
     available  for  social  programs,  while  only  4.3%  went  on <br>
     defense, Karimov said.<br>
        Expenditures on  state  machinery  will  be  cut  by  20%<br>
     starting next year to make more funds available, he said.<br>
     Uzbekistan produced over 60 tonnes of gold in 1996, while<br>
     its gold  and hard  currency reserves  grew to  $1.5  billion, Karimov <br>
     told Interfax.<br>
        Next year  Uzbekistan plans to raise gold output further,<br>
     for which  works are  under way  in the  Pritashkent  district <br>
     together with  Japan's Mitsui  and the  United States' Newmont Mining.<br>

               UZBEK PRESIDENT OPPOSES CIS ALLIANCE AS COUNTERWEIGHT TO NATO<br>
     <br>
                    TASHKENT, Dec  25  (Interfax)  -  Uzbek  President  Islam<br>
               Karimov has  rejected the  idea of  the setting  up of  a  CIS<br>
               military-political  alliance  as  a  counterweight  to  NATO's<br>
               expansion eastwards.<br>
                    The CIS  should develop  through  bilateral  cooperations<br>
               like that between Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, he said at a news<br>
               conference in  Tashkent at  the end  of Kyrgyz President Askar<br>
               Akayev's visit to Uzbekistan.<br>
                    "Of the  over 600 agreements signed in the CIS framework,<br>
               far from all work," he said.<br>
                    Karimov said  that he  and  Akayev  had  signed  numerous<br>
               documents, in  particular a  Treaty on  Eternal Friendship and<br>
               Cooperation. Akayev said that the word Eternal was inserted on<br>
               Karimov's initiative.<br>
                    The military  cooperation treaty  confirms the commitment<br>
               of the  two countries to the U.N. and OSCE charters and states<br>
     <br>
               that Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan do not intend to join alliances<br>
               hostile to  third  countries  or  to  make  their  territories<br>
               available for aggression against third countries.<br>
                    Akayev described  the free trade treaty signed by the two<br>
               countries as a very important document.<br>
                    Volume  of   trade  between   Uzbekistan  and  Kyrgyzstan<br>
               increased by  50% in 1995 and then doubled in 1996. It totaled<br>
               $200 million in the first nine months of 1996.<br>
                    Contrary to  expectations, the two countries did not sign<br>
               an agreement  on increased  supplies of  Uzbek natural  gas to<br>
               Kyrgyzstan at preferential prices.<br>
                    Kyrgyzstan needs 1.15 billion cubic meters of Uzbek gas a<br>
               year. It  purchases most  of the  gas at  $65 for  1,000 cubic<br>
               meters. Kyrgyzstan  hoped to  get 500  million cubic meters of<br>
               Uzbek gas  for its  heating stations  at $50  for 1,000  cubic<br>
               meters in 1997.<br>

     IMF SUSPENDS LOAN TO UZBEKISTAN. The International Monetary Fund on 19 <br>
     December suspended a $185 million standby loan to Uzbekistan, Reuters <br>
     reported. Further disbursements have been postponed because Uzbekistan <br>
     failed to meet the fund's inflation targets, according to Mark <br>
     O'Brien, the IMF's resident representative in Tashkent. Uzbekistan's <br>
     target for 1996 was 25%, but inflation is estimated to have exceeded <br>
     40%. Another factor was the introduction of draconian foreign exchange <br>
     controls in October. Further payments have been condtioned on a "very <br>
     tight financial policy...combined with a full liberalization of access <br>
     to foreign exchange." -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     JOINT VENTURE TO RAISE $188 MLN FOR UZBEKISTAN GOLD PROJECTS<br>
     <br>
                    TASHKENT, Dec  16 (Interfax)  - Angren  Gold  Company,  a<br>
               joint venture  between Uzbekistan,  Newmont Corporation of the<br>
               United States  and Mitsui  of Japan, will pump an initial $188<br>
               million into the development of the Kyzylalmasai and Kochbulak<br>
               gold fields,  Tulkun Shayakubov,  head of  the country's State<br>
               Committee for Geology and Subsurface Resources, told Interfax.<br>
                    Shayakubov said $105 million of the total would be raised<br>
               in foreign bank credit.<br>
                    Newmont and  Mitsui in  May 1996  won a tender to develop<br>
               the two  goldfields in  Tashkent  region,  which  the  geology<br>
               committee estimates  contain an  overall 270  tonnes of  gold,<br>
               with average ore grades of 6-8 grams/tonne.<br>
                    The agreement  to form  the joint  venture was  signed on<br>
               October 2  this year.  Shayakubov said  Newmont and Mitsui own<br>
               respective stakes of 40% and 20%.<br>
                    The geology  committee and  Uzalmazzoloto, a  major Uzbek<br>
               gold  mining   association,  own  a  combined  stake  of  40%.<br>
               Shayakubov said  this was  the first time the Uzbek government<br>
               had agreed  to a  smaller stake  and participatory  share than<br>
               western partners in a gold mining project.<br>
                    Angren Gold Company will probably have an initial charter<br>
               capital of  $20 million,  to be  spent mainly on a feasibility<br>
               study for the Kyzylalmasai and Kochbulak project. The venture,<br>
               by initial  estimates, could  produce 12  tonnes-15 tonnes  of<br>
               gold annually  (for more  details see Interfax Mining &amp; Metals<br>
               Report No. 51-52).<br>

     FREEDOM HOUSE REPORT NOTES LACK OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN CENTRAL ASIA. In <br>
     its annual survey of freedom and democracy worldwide, the U.S.-based <br>
     Freedom House identified Tajikistan and Turkmenistan as among the 17 <br>
     most repressive regimes in the world, RFE-RL reported on 18 December. <br>
     Uzbekistan, which last year also appeared in the worst category, <br>
     improved its record in 1996. Among the CIS countries, Armenia, <br>
     Georgia, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine are rated "partly free;" and <br>
     Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, <br>
     and Uzbekistan are listed as "not free." Freedom House ratings are <br>
     based on a check- list of political rights and civil liberties, <br>
     including the degree of autonomy for minorities, the status of the <br>
     opposition, the nature of electoral laws, and the degree of freedom of <br>
     assembly and freedom of the media. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     ANOTHER POLITICAL CASUALTY IN UZBEKISTAN. The regional governor of the <br>
     Bukhara region, Mavlon Rahmonov, asked to be relieved of his duties on <br>
     14 December, Uzbek Radio reported. Current Deputy Finance Minister <br>
     Samoiddin Husinov, has been nominated by President Islam Karimov to <br>
     replace Rahmonov, who is the fourth regional governor to lose his job <br>
     this year. Poor harvest figures were cited as the reason for <br>
     Rahmonov's departure. While still incomplete, figures on Uzbekistan's <br>
     grain harvest reveal that, on average, less than 80% of the expected <br>
     quota was attained. Poor weather and mismanagement at the regional <br>

     UZBEKISTAN TO BUY RUSSIAN GRAIN. Due to a poor 1996 harvest, <br>
     Uzbekistan agreed to exchange 100,000 metric tons of grain from Russia <br>
     in return for 18,200 tons of cotton, the BBC reported on 9 December. <br>
     The agreement is backed by a $27 million guarantee from European <br>
     bankers. Officials noted that Uzbekistan will have to make further <br>
     grain imports, as the 2.7 million ton harvest fell short of the 4.5 <br>
     million tons the country requires. -- Roger Kangas<br>

     UZBEK HISTORIOGRAPHY. Academics working under President Islam <br>
     Karimov's Academy for State and Societal Construction plan to issue a <br>
     three-volume "Modern History of Uzbekistan," Khalq Sozi reported on 27 <br>
     November as monitored by the BBC. The book will cover Tsarist <br>
     colonialism, "Soviet Colonialism," and Uzbekistan's modern history of <br>
     independence. The academics, led by historian Hamdam Sodiqov, are <br>
     battling against "false conceptions about the history of independence" <br>
     and "former Kremlin and Communist Party sycophants," the report said. <br>

     UPDATE ON CURRENCY CRISIS IN UZBEKISTAN. President Islam Karimov <br>
     hinted that importers bringing "high quality" goods into Uzbekistan <br>
     would enjoy a greater degree of convertibility from January 1997. <br>
     Karimov went on to say joint ventures engaged in "civilized business <br>
     with Uzbekistan will not suffer any material losses." His remarks, <br>
     broadcast on Uzbek Radio on 27 November and monitored by the BBC, <br>
     suggest the government is attempting to step back from regulations <br>
     introduced in late October that effectively forbid foreign currency <br>
     transactions and limit currency conversion to a handful of large firms <br>
     operating in Uzbekistan. Diplomats, traders, and international lending <br>
     institutions have all registered their displeasure with the new <br>
     regulations. In other news, Uzbek Radio on 26 November announced the <br>
     minimum monthly wage in Uzbekistan would rise to 600 som, <br>
     approximately $12 at the official exchange rate but about $5 on the <br>
     black market. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     NIYAZOV IN TASHKENT. Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov began a two- <br>
     day state visit to Uzbekistan on 27 November, and signed a number of <br>
     economic and cultural agreements designed to improve relations which <br>
     have been overall cool, Western and Russian news agencies reported. <br>
     Niyazov and his Uzbek counterpart, Islam Karimov, also discussed the <br>
     situations in Tajikistan and Afghanistan. On 21 November, Uzbekistan <br>
     opened an embassy in Ashgabat. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     UZBEK PARLIAMENT OPENS WITH HUMAN RIGHTS AGENDA. The 7th session of <br>
     the Oliy Majlis opened on 26 November with a list of "democratization" <br>
     proposals on the agenda, Uzbek TV reported. The steering committee of <br>
     the legislature, under the leadership of speaker Erkin Khalilov, met <br>
     on 22 November to set the agenda, which includes the creation of a <br>
     government institution designed to ensure that legislation abides by <br>
     international standards of "democracy and human rights." In addition, <br>
     the Oliy Majlis is expected to pass legislation on political parties, <br>
     the protection of independent journalists, and greater access to state <br>
     information. While other legislation will be considered, it is evident <br>
     that this session will be marked as one in which human rights became a <br>
     high priority for the government, Uzbek officials note. -- Roger <br>

     KAZAKSTAN AGREES WITH UZBEKISTAN, KYRGYZSTAN ON GAS DEBTS. Kazakstan <br>
     has signed an agreement with Uzbekistan in Tashkent on paying off its <br>
     $24 million debt for Uzbek gas, Kazakhstanskaya pravda reported on 19 <br>
     November. In October, Uzbekistan withheld gas deliveries due to <br>
     nonpayments and the Kazakstani capital, Almaty, received only half of <br>
     what it needed for that month, leading to a severe gas deficiency in <br>
     many households. Besides direct monetary compensation to pay for Uzbek <br>
     gas, Kazakstan also offered to supply gas from Caspian Sea regions of <br>
     Kazakstan to western Uzbekistan. Kazakstan is also close to completing <br>
     a deal with Kyrgyzstan on electricity supplies to southern Kazakstan. <br>
     The Kyrgyz have agreed to defer Kazakstan's $8 million debt for Kyrgyz <br>
     electricity but prices for electricity will now be higher. -- Slava <br>

     UZBEKISTAN, KAZAKSTAN SIGN GAS DEAL. An agreement signed in Tashkent <br>
     on 18 November will open the way for Uzbekistan to ship $150 million <br>
     worth of gas to southern Kazakstan, the BBC reported on 19 November. <br>
     The agreement resulted from a one-day meeting that focused attention <br>
     on the fact that Kazakstan currently owes its southern neighbor $26 <br>
     million for 1995 gas shipments. Kazakstan had no alternative but to <br>
     sign the agreement after it failed to take advantage of its own <br>
     untapped resources and finalize gas shipment arrangements with <br>
     Turkmenistan. The deal is seen as a major step for Uzbekistan, which <br>
     hopes to capitalize on its growing capacity to export raw materials <br>
     and energy resources and, in the process, settle its own economic <br>
     problems. -- Roger Kangas<br>

     MONETARY CRISIS WORSENS IN UZBEKISTAN. Uzbek commercial banks were <br>
     severely criticized at an 11 November session of the parliamentary <br>
     Budget, Banking, and Financial Affairs Committee, Halq sozi reported <br>
     on 12 November. Calling the banks "irresponsible," the committee noted <br>
     that they are not abiding by recent decrees enumerating the monetary <br>
     transactions that a bank may engage in. As part of an effort to curb <br>
     the drop in the som's value, the Uzbek government has initiated a <br>
     series of measures that effectively restrict access to hard <br>
     currencies. The report noted, however, that the guidelines are <br>
     difficult to enforce and 432 million soms worth of violations have <br>
     occurred in recent weeks. -- Roger Kangas<br>

     UZBEK PRESIDENT CONCLUDES BELGIAN VISIT. Uzbek President Islam Karimov <br>
     ended a two-day visit to Belgium on 13 November that included a series <br>
     of high-level meetings with EU and NATO officials to discuss <br>
     Uzbekistan's involvement in the Partnership for Peace program and <br>
     other issues, Russian and Western media reported. According to Uzbek <br>
     officials, Karimov met with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana and <br>
     discussed the situation in Central Asia and Afghanistan. Before <br>
     leaving, Karimov met with Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene to <br>

     UZBEKISTAN GETS MORE BLACK MARKS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. According to an 11 <br>
     November press release from Human Rights Watch (HRW), Hasan Mirsaidov, <br>
     son of Uzbek dissident Shukhrullo Mirsaidov, was abducted by three <br>
     armed men on 9 November, beaten, blindfolded, handcuffed, and held for <br>
     12 hours before being freed. According to Erika Dailey of HRW, this is <br>
     only the latest event in a campaign to apply pressure on the Mirsaidov <br>
     family. The Uzbek government has renewed attempts to legally deport <br>
     the family from Uzbekistan although the original case was filed some <br>
     time ago and remained "dormant" for 18 months, being brought up again <br>
     shortly before the kidnapping. Although HRW is calling for a complete <br>
     investigation into the case, the organization acknowledges that "there <br>
     is little hope of an impartial investigation since the incident was <br>
     undoubtedly carried out at the behest of the Uzbek government." -- <br>

     RUSSIAN ORTHODOX PATRIARCH IN UZBEKISTAN. Patriarch Aleksii II of <br>
     Moscow, the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, is in Uzbekistan to <br>
     celebrate the 125th anniversary of the establishment of two eparchies <br>
     of the Russian Orthodox Church in Uzbekistan, ITAR-TASS reported on 11 <br>
     November. Uzbek President Islam Karimov told Aleksei that new churches <br>
     had been built in Bukhara, Kashkadarya, and Syrdarya and that the St. <br>
     Aleksei Church in Samarkand had recently been renovated. Aleksii said <br>
     the visit was intended to "extend spiritual and moral support to the <br>
     Orthodox believers who have found themselves beyond the boundaries of <br>
     Russia." -- Bruce Pannier<br>

 CENTRAL ASIANS AT DONOR CONFERENCE IN JAPAN. The prime ministers of Kazakstan, <br>
 Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are in Japan for a three-day conference for countries <br>
 that give aid to Central Asian states, ITAR- TASS and NTV reported. Japan was <br>
 the only country to go on record with new funding schemes for the three <br>
 countries. Kazakstan was pledged $200 million for projects ranging from <br>
 building new bridges to constructing medical centers, according to Kazak <br>
 Television monitored by the BBC. ITAR-TASS reported Tajikistan will receive <br>
 about $2.25 million in credits for construction of international airports at <br>
 Dushanbe, Khojent, and Kulyab. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

 JAPANESE GIVE MONEY TO UPGRADE UZBEK AIRPORTS. The Japanese government <br>
 announced on 30 October that a credit of 15.5 billion yen (more than $140 <br>
 million) will be given to Uzbekistan to upgrade airports in Samarkand, Bukhara <br>
 and Urgench, ITAR-TASS reported. The three cities date back to the days of the <br>
 Silk Route and are the sites of many historical monuments. The Uzbek government <br>
 hopes that improvement in the airports will aid the tourism industry, with <br>
 profits then channeled into industry. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

 NEW POLITICAL OFFICE CREATED IN UZBEKISTAN. In an address to the cabinet, Uzbek <br>
 President Islam Karimov announced that Qobiljon Obidov will be appointed to the <br>
 newly-created position of first deputy prime minister with special <br>
 responsibility for agriculture and water resources, Uzbek TV reported on 29 <br>
 October. Given recent poor harvests in the Syrdarya and Jizzak regions (see <br>
 OMRI Daily Digest, 29 October 1996), Karimov has called for greater oversight <br>
 and a more defined division of labor in the presidential apparatus. -- Roger <br>

 POLITICAL HEADS ROLL IN UZBEKISTAN. Uzbek President Islam Karimov dismissed the <br>
 Hokim (Governor) of Syrdarya region on 28 October, Uzbek TV reported. <br>
 Ghulomqodir Khasanov was officially relieved of his duties because of his <br>
 failure to meet grain and cotton harvest targets. He will be replaced by Deputy <br>
 Prime Minister Utkam Ismailov. Karimov dismissed the Hokim of Jizzak region, <br>
 Alisher Toshkenboev, on 25 October for the same reason. The firings follow a <br>
 pattern of Hokim replacements that began after last fall's poor grain harvest. <br>

 UZBEK YOUTH ORGANIZATION STARTS PAPER. The youth organization Kamolot <br>
 (Perfection) sent to press the first issue of its independent newspaper, Uzbek <br>
 radio reported on 20 October. Also called Kamolot, the newspaper will begin <br>
 service in the Namangan region and will partially act as a promotional vehicle <br>
 for the organization. Founded in the summer of 1996, Kamolot is a <br>
 government-funded "non-governmental organization" which is supposed to fill the <br>
 role of the Soviet-era Komsomol. Unlike that entity, however, Kamolot is <br>
 allowed to court Western companies for financial assistance which can be <br>
 matched by government contributions. -- Roger Kangas<br>

     LEADERS OF TURKIC-SPEAKING COUNTRIES MEET. The presidents of six <br>
     Turkic- speaking countries assembled in Tashkent on 21 October, AFP <br>
     reported. It was the fourth meeting between the presidents of <br>
     Azerbaijan, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and <br>
     Turkey. Discussion centered on trade relations: although the subject <br>
     of Afghanistan was touched on, Uzbek President Islam Karimov said the <br>
     heads of state "would not be dragged into settling political matters." <br>
     However, some time was devoted to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. <br>
     Azerbaijani President Heidar Aliev again said that he was prepared to <br>
     give maximum autonomy to the region but that "Nagorno-Karabakh will <br>
     never be independent." The presidents signed a declareiterating "their <br>
     firm and unchanging commitment to the principles of<br>
     democracy, respect for human rights and a market economy," said <br>
     Karimov. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     TAMERLANE CELEBRATION BEGINS IN UZBEKISTAN. The much-anticipated <br>
     celebration of the 660th anniversary of Amir Timur, or Tamerlane, <br>
     began on 18 October, Narodnoe slovo reported, as monitored by the BBC <br>
     on 21 October. Uzbek President Islam Karimov officially opened a <br>
     museum in Tashkent devoted to the Central Asian figure, noting that <br>
     "the civilized world has a proper appreciation of Tamerlane's undying <br>
     service to mankind." The ceremony included readings from the Koran, <br>
     blessings from honored elders, and a traditional plov (pilau) feast. <br>
     For the next month, similar celebrations will take place throughout <br>
     Uzbekistan. -- Roger Kangas<br>

 PAKISTAN'S PRESIDENT VISITS UZBEKISTAN. Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari on 20 October <br>
 concluded a three-day visit to Uzbekistan, where he met President Islam Karimov <br>
 and other government officials, ITAR-TASS reported. The two leaders signed <br>
 several agreements, ranging from anti- drug trafficking cooperation to <br>
 joint-venture trading. According to Uzbek TV on 18 October, bilateral trade is <br>
 restricted because of the blockage of transport routes across Afghanistan. <br>
 Trade between Uzbekistan and Pakistan stood at $12.7 million for the first six <br>
 months of 1996, up from $11.6 million for all of 1995. -- Roger Kangas<br>

     MIXED RETURNS ON UZBEK HARVESTS. The Uzbek government announced that <br>
     grain harvests are well below expectations for the second year in a <br>
     row, according to an 8 October Uzbek Radio report monitored by the <br>
     BBC. The 1996 harvest currently stands at 2,669,000 metric tons, well <br>
     below the target figure of 4.5 million tons. Only seven regions were <br>
     able to meet their quotas, with the rest blaming poor irrigation, bad <br>
     weather, and a lack of fertilizer for the shortfalls. At the same <br>
     time, the Central Council of the People's Democratic Party called on <br>
     Uzbek citizens to participate in the cotton harvest, which is expected <br>
     to be higher than last year (see OMRI Daily Digest, 15 October 1996). <br>
     Regional party leaders are even offering prizes for the most "active" <br>
     volunteer--a practice reminiscent of the Soviet era--Golos Uzbekistana <br>
     reported on 11 October. -- Roger Kangas<br>

     UZBEK SOM IN TROUBLE? The Uzbek Central Bank has refuted rumors that <br>
     the country's currency is unstable, Ozbekiston Ovozi reported on 12 <br>
     October. In a published statement, the bank said there is no <br>
     government plan to introduce a new currency in Uzbekistan or devalue <br>

     decline. While the som remained stable for most of 1995 and 1996, it <br>
     began to fall from its rate of 35/$1 in the summer of 1996 to the <br>
     current level of 40.50/$1. More telling is the fact that the black <br>

     UZBEK SOM IN TROUBLE? The Uzbek Central Bank has refuted rumors that <br>
     the country's currency is unstable, Ozbekiston Ovozi reported on 12 <br>
     October. In a published statement, the bank said there is no <br>
     government plan to introduce a new currency in Uzbekistan or devalue <br>
     the existing som as a means of putting a stop to the currency's steady <br>
     decline. While the som remained stable for most of 1995 and 1996, it <br>
     began to fall from its rate of 35/$1 in the summer of 1996 to the <br>
     current level of 40.50/$1. More telling is the fact that the black <br>
     market rate has jumped from 40/$1 to more than 70/$1 over the same <br>
     period. Curiously, the currency woes are taking place when <br>
     Uzbekistan's economic output and foreign investment are increasing. -- <br>

     A RUSSIAN ASSESSMENT OF UZBEKISTAN'S AFGHAN RESPONSE. Uzbekistan has <br>
     moved some of its elite troops to Termez, the military garrison on the <br>
     border, and has asked its officers not on active duty to reregister, <br>
     NTV reported on 11 October. According to the report, there is no basis <br>
     for Uzbekistan's fear of a Taliban invasion, but a defeat of General <br>
     Rashid Dostum's forces in northern Afghanistan could lead to "crowds <br>
     of [ethnic Uzbek] refugees" flooding into Uzbekistan. Also, "a victory <br>
     by the fundamentalists" would have a negative influence on the <br>
     situation in the Fergana Valley where the Uzbek government has been <br>
     fighting to keep organized Islamic groups under control. -- Bruce <br>

     UZBEK MEDIA SHOOTS BACK. Uzbek media has lashed out at what it deems <br>
     to be the Russian media's recent slanderous coverage of Uzbekistan, <br>
     RFE/RL reported on 10 October. The usually cautious Uzbek media was <br>
     responding to a number of articles that appeared in late September in <br>
     Izvestiya, Nezavisimaya gazeta, and Komsomolskaya pravda pointing to <br>
     corruption and political repression in Uzbekistan. The Russian press <br>
     was also charged with wrongly accusing Tashkent of allying itself with <br>
     Afghan General Abdul Rashid Dostum, an ethnic Uzbek, to seize <br>
     territory from Tajikistan. The Uzbek media said the "hostile coverage" <br>
     was aimed at Russia's efforts to play "big brother" in the region. -- <br>

     TALIBAN EXTENDING OLIVE BRANCH? A spokesman for the Taliban movement <br>
     claims that Central Asia has nothing to fear from the group that now <br>
     controls most of Afghanistan, Rusian Public TV (ORT) reported on 7 <br>
     October. The acting foreign minister of the Taliban, Muhammed Ghous, <br>
     called upon the UN "to convince Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakstan, and <br>
     Kyrgyzstan not to meddle in Afghanistan's internal affairs and the <br>
     Taliban for their part will not interfere in the affairs of other <br>
     countries." A radio broadcast originating in Pakistan on 6 October <br>
     announced that the Taliban would soon send representatives to the <br>
     Central Asian states as a demonstration of the group's "brotherly <br>
     love" for the region, Radio Rossii reported on 6 October. However, <br>
     Ghous reportedly said "we do not want Russia to forget the lesson they <br>
     were taught here," referring to the Soviet military campaign in <br>
     Afghanistan in the 1980s. -- Bruce Pannier<br>

     ALMATY PREPARES FOR CIS SUMMIT. On 4 October Russian and Central Asian <br>
     leaders will gather in Almaty to discuss the implications of the <br>
     Taliban victories in Afghanistan, along with other issues. <br>
     Turkmenistan announced that it would not attend the Almaty summit due <br>
     to its policy of "positive neutrality," Russian and Western media <br>
     reported on 3 October. Kazakstani Security Council chief Baltash <br>
     Tursumbayev said Russian Security Council Secretary Aleksandr Lebed <br>
     has exaggerated the threat posed to Central Asia by Taliban successes <br>
     in Afghanistan, Nezavisimaya gazeta and RTR reported on 3 October. <br>
     Tursumbayev termed Lebed's 1 October assertion that the Taliban <br>
     coveted territory in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, including Bukhara, as <br>
     "rash and lacking foundation." -- Lowell Bezanis and Bruce Pannier<br>

Uzbekistan--OSCE Forum Masks Censorship <br>
     <br>
(October 4, 1996) New York, NY   In a meeting beginning today in Toshkent, the <br>
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will be giving <br>
tacit approval to strict government control of the media and fierce repression <br>
of free speech in Uzbekistan. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki, in a letter <br>
released today, charges that OSCE's human rights arm, the Office for <br>
Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) undermines its own mandate by <br>
sponsoring a forum at which only Uzbekistan government officials are invited <br>
to speak and for failing to put the crucial issue of overt state censorship on <br>
the agenda. <br>
     <br>
     The two-day Round-Table on Media Issues in the Transition to Democracy <br>
takes as its starting-point "the role an independent media can play in building <br>
democratic societies," yet censorship does not even appear on the agenda.  <br>
Although censorship is explicitly banned by the Uzbekistan constitution, <br>
censors control newspapers, television and radio, and police and security <br>
services harass, intimidate, fire, and sometimes beat journalists for pursuing <br>
such banal lines of inquiry as the national inflation rate. Censorship, coupled <br>
with political repression, is so much a way of life for journalists that most <br>
of the time they censor their own questions before they ask them.<br>
     <br>
     The media workshop, organized jointly by OSCE's ODIHR and the Uzbekistan<br>
president's Institute for Strategic and Regional Studies, will be dominated by <br>
government delegates and by chief editors from the main newspapers and <br>
broadcast media. A number of foreign media experts will take part, but there <br>
will be no other participants in the debate, nor will interventions be allowed <br>
from the floor, according to Human Rights Watch/Helsinki.  No representative <br>
of the press censor   the State Control Inspectorate   is even among the <br>
invited speakers to hear any criticism that might possibly be raised by the <br>
OSCE or others.<br>
     <br>
     "For the OSCE to knowingly sponsor such an event, and pave the way for<br>
the truth to be grossly distorted, is tantamount to giving an international <br>
seal of approval to the stifling of free expression in the media in <br>
Uzbekistan.  Their actions are inexplicable and inexcusable, and do active <br>
detriment to human rights advocacy, a process that has just begun in this <br>
country," declared Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights <br>
Watch/Helsinki.<br>
     <br>
      The text of the Human Rights Watch/Helsinki letter to the ODIHR is<br>
attached.<br>

     <br>
Dear Ambassador Glover,<br>
     <br>
     On behalf of Human Rights Watch/Helsinki, I extend to you my best regards<br>
on the occasion of the opening of the OSCE seminar "Media Issues in the <br>
Transition to Democracy." <br>
     <br>
     Human Rights Watch has followed with great interest the work which the<br>
OSCE and specifically the Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights <br>
have been doing in Uzbekistan. We also note the personal interest you have <br>
taken in promoting the human rights dialogue in that country.  We welcome the <br>
expansion of OSCE human rights work in Uzbekistan, and look forward to the <br>
arrival of your new human rights officer in the Uzbekistan capital, Toshkent. <br>
We will, for our part, offer all possible assistance.<br>
     <br>
     While we see the OSCE input to the human rights debate in Uzbekistan as<br>
in the main very positive and constructive, we are concerned that this seminar <br>
deviates strongly from OSCE goals and generally from the interests of human <br>
rights protection.  We believe that the topic of the media is particularly <br>
well suited for Uzbekistan at this point in its history since it identifies <br>
one of the government's most widespread instruments of abuse: denial of free <br>
speech. State control of the media violates both international human rights <br>
obligations and Article 67 of its own constitution, which states categorically <br>
that "the mass media shall be free... censorship is impermissible."<br>
     <br>
     At the same time, we are very much concerned that the Round-Table on<br>
Media Issues in the Transition to Democracy, at which you will give the <br>
opening address on October 4, stands in danger of  placing the OSCE/ODIHR <br>
imprimatur on a situation which could in fact hardly be less deserving of <br>
perceived international recognition: that of the media in Uzbekistan. As you <br>
will be aware, the press and broadcast media there have changed little since <br>
Soviet times in terms of the scope for free expression. Censorship is <br>
omnipresent: in the figure of the television editor who cuts reports into the <br>
appropriate, politically anemic shape, and in the form of officials not <br>
employed by any newspaper yet who edit all of the main dailies, from masthead <br>
to sports pages, before they can go to press.  For inquiring about issues that <br>
would be considered wholly banal in non-repressive countries, such as the <br>
country's inflation rate, journalists are hounded, threatened with loss of <br>
their jobs, harm to their families, and some have been beaten.  Censorship, <br>
coupled with political repression, is so much a way of life for journalists <br>
that most of the time they censor their own questions before they ask them. <br>
This leads to the insidious practice of self-censorship.  The practice is so <br>
widespread that recent calls by President Islam Karimov for journalists to <br>
genuinely challenge government policies are wholly disingenuous.<br>
     <br>
     newspaper editors, and several foreign experts.<br>
However, no interventions from anyone but this small group of participants will <br>
be possible; outsiders can apply to attend only as silent observers, and then <br>
only by securing the approval of Uzbek officials, who clearly will tailor the <br>
list in their own favor. Therefore, while we are sure that you and other <br>
foreigners will raise concern about censorship and other media-related human <br>
rights abuse, the dialogue is likely to be something of a foregone conclusion: <br>
overwhelmed by Uzbekistan government calls for tinkering with the trappings of <br>
media in transitional governments, such as journalist training programs, with <br>
most of the strong criticism by foreign observers glossed over or entirely <br>
omitted in subsequent media reports.  Human Rights Watch/Helsinki believes <br>
that, on the contrary, the starting point for discussion must be the <br>
government's abusive practices: strict censorship, arbitrary closing of <br>
"undesirable" publications, such as Vesti Kul'tury, the publication of the <br>
independent Russian Center this year, and harassment of journalists.  <br>
     <br>
     The limited guest list and, consequently, likely restricted dialogue,<br>
would be regrettable enough were the seminar solely a project organized and <br>
funded by the Uzbekistan government. However, OSCE involvement lends both <br>
international credibility and funding to a dialogue which will overwhelmingly <br>
benefit, not censure, the Uzbekistan government.  We believe it is incumbent <br>
upon the OSCE to impose its own, higher standards at all times   standards <br>
that are derived first and foremost from international conventions.  We <br>
therefore must protest the failure of the OSCE to insure that independent <br>
actors and, ideally, local journalists themselves, have the opportunity to <br>
publicly challenge the government perspective that will be the centerpiece of <br>
the seminar.<br>
     <br>
     Since the round-table is unlikely to alter in focus at this stage, Human<br>
Rights Watch/Helsinki has, with regret, taken the decision not to send an <br>
observer, since that person must be silent. We want to distance ourselves from <br>
an essentially a government-dominated event which in reality is not likely to <br>
improve the position of journalists or free speech.  In lieu of a personal <br>
presence, we take the opportunity now to submit to you the recommendations <br>
made in our report on the media, which will be released in conjunction with <br>
the seminar.  Specifically, we respectfully ask you to call on the government <br>
of Uzbekistan to take the following short-term steps to comply with its <br>
domestic and international obligations to uphold free speech rights and <br>
protect and help develop the independent media:<br>
     <br>
--   Immediately abolish the State Control Inspectorate (press censor) and<br>
     all analogous censorship organizations;<br>
     <br>
--   Give public assurances that journalists, photo-journalists and staff<br>
     working for foreign correspondents are not harassed for the peaceful <br>
     expression of their opinions and practice of their profession;<br>
     <br>
--   Vigorously investigate and prosecute reports of harassment and beatings<br>
     of such individuals, and make the results of those investigations <br>
     public; <br>
     <br>
--   Immediately lift the ban on prohibited newspapers such as Erk and<br>
     Mustaqil Haftalik, and end persecution of such publications' writers, <br>
     sponsors, editors and distributors for their possession and <br>
     dissemination;<br>
     <br>
--   Immediately print the full texts of human rights documents, such as the<br>
     Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the International Covenant on <br>
     Civil and Political Rights, in the mass circulation press in Uzbekistan <br>
     in the Uzbek and Russian languages.<br>
     <br>
     Thank you in advance for your consideration of the concerns we have<br>
raised in this letter. We welcome your comments on the above issues and look <br>
forward to a continued relationship of open dialogue and cooperation with the <br>
OSCE and ODIHR on these and other important human rights issues.  As always, <br>
please do not hesitate to contact us if we can be of any assistance to you. <br>
     <br>
Sincerely,<br>
     <br>

     UZBEKISTAN BREAKS SILENCE ON AFGHANISTAN. Uzbekistan's Security <br>
     Council held an extraordinary session on 1 October to discuss the <br>
     situation in Afghanistan, Russian media reported the next day. <br>
     Tashkent officially declared its "serious concern" over events in that <br>
     country and pledged itself to pursuing a "peaceful foreign policy <br>
     aimed at non-interference in the internal affairs of neighboring <br>
     countries" and a "peace settlement" in Afghanistan, ITAR-TASS reported <br>
     the same day. These remarks, virtually identical to those expressed <br>
     earlier by other Central Asian states and Russia, are the first to <br>
     emerge from Tashkent since the 26 September seizure of Kabul by <br>
     Taliban fighters. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     CENTRAL ASIA VOICES CONCERN OVER KABUL'S FALL. The Tajik government on <br>
     30 September expressed its concern that the recent events in Kabul <br>
     will have a negative impact on efforts to secure the Tajik-Afghan <br>
     border, Russian media reported. Also on 30 September, the Kazakstani <br>
     Foreign Ministry called on the UN to take urgent measures to end the <br>
     bloodshed in Afghanistan, warning that economic collapse and political <br>
     instability there could threaten the stability of Central Asia, <br>
     ITAR-TASS reported. -- Lowell Bezanis and Bruce Pannier<br>

     KAZAK-KYRGYZ-UZBEK TRINITY? Kazakstani President Nazarbayev has sent a <br>
     letter to his Uzbek counterpart Islam Karimov suggesting Almaty is <br>
     disappointed with the unimplemented customs union agreement signed <br>
     with Russia, Belarus, and Kyrgyzstan, RFE/RL reported on 19 September. <br>
     Nazarbayev proposed closer ties with Bishkek and Tashkent, including <br>
     the establishment of a unified parliament of the three countries. <br>
     Delovaya nedelya., carrying the RFE/RL report on 20 September, noted <br>
     that Nazarbayev initially expressed his concerns during unofficial <br>
     talks with Karimov and Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev in Jambul in <br>
     August. The report also alleged that Almaty's plans to become Moscow's <br>
     principal ally have failed to bear fruit as Belarus is successfully <br>
     playing this role, and that Tashkent is cool to Nazarbayev's newfound <br>
     interest in his fellow Central Asians. -- Lowell Bezanis and Merhat <br>

     DRAFT LAW ON POLITICAL PARTIES PUBLISHED IN UZBEKISTAN. Narodno slovo <br>
     on 19 September published a draft law on political parties for public <br>
     discussion. It prohibits the establishment of parties based on ethnic <br>
     or religious lines, and those advocating war or the subversion of the <br>
     constitutional order, according to the BBC-monitored report. Military <br>
     and law-enforcement personnel, foreigners, and stateless people will <br>
     not be able to join parties. In a bid to prevent regionally based <br>
     parties, the law stipulates that prospective parties must divulge <br>
     details of 3,000 members distributed over at least eight of the <br>
     country's regional- level administrative territories. Parties may not <br>
     accept donations from state, foreign, religious, or anonymous sources. <br>

     PRIMAKOV: ISLAM IS NOT "THE ENEMY OF WORLD CIVILIZATION." In an <br>
     article in Nezavisimaya Gazeta of 18 September, Foreign Minister <br>
     Yevgenii Primakov distinguished between "Islamic extremism" and <br>
     "Islamic fundamentalism." Primakov argues that fundamentalism is a <br>
     natural response to historical developments, such as the former <br>
     persecution of Islam. "Islamic extremism," which he defines as the use <br>
     of force to change state borders, he regards as unacceptable. <br>
     Primakov, formerly a scholar of the Middle East, is thus trying to <br>
     justify Moscow's role in Tajikistan and Chechnya, while signaling that <br>
     it wants friendly relations with the Islamic world and with the 17 <br>
     million Muslims who live inside Russia. -- Peter Rutland<br>

     UZBEKISTAN HOSTS AFGHAN TALKS. An Afghan government delegation arrived <br>
     in Tashkent on 17 September for three days of what were described as <br>
     "secret" talks with Afghan General Rashid Dostum, an ethnic Uzbek <br>
     commander in control of much of Afghan territory south of Uzbekistan, <br>
     AFP reported the same day. Dostum, widely considered to be under <br>
     Tashkent's patronage, is being vigorously courted by Kabul after the <br>
     government lost the strategic town of Jalalabad last week, giving rise <br>
     to fears Kabul may be overrun by the Taliban militia which presently <br>
     controls an estimated 60% of the country. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     OLD TECHNIQUES TO INJECT NEW IDEAS. A decree published in Pravda <br>
     Vostoka on 10 September and monitored by the BBC sheds light on <br>
     President Islam Karimov's efforts to supplant "old totalitarian, <br>
     dictatorship ideology" with "spiritual reform and enlightenment." The <br>
     decree itself orders regional administration heads to undergo <br>
     spiritual ideology tests by the end of the year. It also significantly <br>
     strengthens the role of the Manaviyat and Marifat (Spirituality and <br>
     Enlightenment) public center. The latter will work to achieve the <br>
     basic aim of the country's ideological policy of improving "national <br>
     thinking and historical freedom" and "awakening the spirit of <br>
     independence." Along with its subsidiary, the Golden Heritage (Oltin <br>
     Meros) charity fund, the center will work in conjunction with the <br>
     Uzbek Culture Ministry, Uzbekturizm, the Kamolot republican youth <br>
     fund, and Uzbek Television and Radio to "spread spirituality and <br>
     enlightenment." -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     COUNCIL OF CIS BORDER FORCES MEETS IN TBILISI. The commanders of the <br>
     CIS border guard services gathered in Tbilisi to discuss several <br>
     agreements aimed at closer cooperation among their forces, including a <br>
     declaration of demarcation and external border protection principles, <br>
     Russian and Western agencies reported on 12 September. Azerbaijan, <br>
     Georgia, and Turkmenistan did not sign part of the package, including <br>
     the declaration, and Moldova, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan did not attend <br>
     the meeting at all, NTV reported on 12 September. Special attention <br>
     was paid to extending the 22 January 1993 CIS agreement "On measures <br>
     to stabilize the situation on the state border between Tajikistan and <br>
     Afghanistan" until 1997. Speaking after his meeting with Georgian <br>
     President Eduard Shevardnadze, Russian Federal Border Service Director <br>
     Andrei Nikolaev denied that Russian-Georgian relations had worsened <br>
     and noted that Russia pays for 60% of Georgia's external border <br>
     patrols. -- Elin Suleymanov<br>

     HUMAN RIGHTS CONFERENCE IN TASHKENT. A three-day OSCE-sponsored <br>
     conference on human rights--bringing together non-governmental <br>
     organizations operating in Central Asia, government officials, and <br>
     government-selected media representatives--opened in Tashkent on 11 <br>
     September, Western agencies reported. Human rights are far from <br>
     respected in Central Asia with print and broadcast media carefully <br>
     censored or directly controlled by the government and minimal <br>
     tolerance shown for political opposition. Among a litany of other <br>
     human rights violations, AFP noted that 40 journalists have been <br>
     killed in Tajikistan since 1992, some 30 prisoners of conscience are <br>
     presently in Uzbek jails, and 600 prisoners died in Kazakstani jails <br>
     of tuberculosis last year and another 101 were executed. The venue of <br>
     the conference is considered a further signal of Uzbekistan's desire <br>
     to soften the regime's image abroad. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     OLD TECHNIQUES TO INJECT NEW IDEAS. A decree published in Pravda <br>
     Vostoka on 10 September and monitored by the BBC sheds light on <br>
     President Islam Karimov's efforts to supplant "old totalitarian, <br>
     dictatorship ideology" with "spiritual reform and enlightenment." The <br>
     decree itself orders regional administration heads to undergo <br>
     spiritual ideology tests by the end of the year. It also significantly <br>
     strengthens the role of the Manaviyat and Marifat (Spirituality and <br>
     Enlightenment) public center. The latter will work to achieve the <br>
     basic aim of the country's ideological policy of improving "national <br>
     thinking and historical freedom" and "awakening the spirit of <br>
     independence." Along with its subsidiary, the Golden Heritage (Oltin <br>
     Meros) charity fund, the center will work in conjunction with the <br>
     Uzbek Culture Ministry, Uzbekturizm, the Kamolot republican youth <br>
     fund, and Uzbek Television and Radio to "spread spirituality and <br>
     enlightenment." -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     GEORGIAN-UZBEK MILITARY COOPERATION. Georgian Defense Minister Vardiko <br>
     Nadibaidze and his Uzbek counterpart, Rustam Akhme-dov, signed a <br>
     package of bilateral military agreements in Tbilisi on 10 September, <br>
     Georgian and Russian media reported the same day. The package includes <br>
     an interstate treaty on military cooperation, an intergovernmental <br>
     agreement on military and technical cooperation, another on <br>
     cooperation between the two countries' Defense ministries, and a <br>
     protocol on providing airfield and technical support and protection <br>
     for aircraft from their respective airforces, according to a 10 <br>
     September Iprinda report monitored by the BBC. The same day Akhmedov <br>
     said the Uzbek government opposes the creation of a coalition of CIS <br>
     armed forces, ITAR-TASS reported. Akhmedov suggested that such a <br>
     grouping could lead to another Cold War. --  Lowell Bezanis<br>

     UZBEKISTAN'S HUMAN RIGHT SOCIETY HOLDS CONGRESS. Delegates to a <br>
     congress of Uzbekistan's Human Rights Society (HRS) in Tashkent on 7 <br>
     September noted that the human rights situation in Uzbekistan is <br>
     "beginning to improve," RFE/RL reported. Until virtually the last <br>
     minute it was unclear if the Uzbek authorities would permit the <br>
     gathering to take place. The fact that it did take place may be <br>
     attributed to Tashkent's efforts to burnish its tarnished human rights <br>
     image and improve relations with the U.S.. The HRS was founded in 1992 <br>
     but is still not officially registered in the country. HRS Chairman <br>
     Abdulmanop Pulatov returned recently to Tashkent after the activities <br>
     of his group were given an unofficial green light from Uzbek President <br>
     Islam Karimov. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     KARIMOV ON HUMAN RIGHTS, OPPOSITION. Speaking to parliament on 29 <br>
     August, Uzbek President Islam Karimov said his government is committed <br>
     to boosting cooperation with international human rights organizations, <br>
     Reuters reported the same day. In the speech that marked the country's <br>
     fifth year of independence, Karimov praised the republic's political <br>
     stability and added that there is a need for political "alternatives" <br>
     as long as they are "constructive." -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     UZBEKISTAN'S CENTRAL BANK CUTS REFINANCING RATE. The Central Bank of <br>
     Uzbekistan has announced that in late August and September the <br>
     refinancing rate at which it provides short-term credits to other <br>
     financial institutions will be set at 4% per month, down from 5% in <br>
     July-August and 7% in the first half of the year, Delovoi mir reported <br>
     on 27 August. Lower refinancing rates reflect the government's success <br>
     in keeping inflation low. The average monthly inflation rate in the <br>
     first half of 1996 was 4%, compared to 8% during the same period a <br>
     year earlier. -- Natalia Gurushina<br>

     UZBEK DISSIDENT RETURNS TO TASHKENT. Human rights campaigner <br>
     Abdulmanop Pulatov returned to Tashkent last week, AFP reported on 28 <br>
     August. Pulatov, who has been living in Washington, D.C., since 1993, <br>
     returned following the visit of Uzbek President Islam Karimov to the <br>
     United States in June. According to Pulatov, Karimov "personally <br>
     guaranteed" his safety and assured him he could continue his political <br>
     activities in Uzbekistan. The softening of Karimov's line comes at a <br>
     time when Uzbekistan is trying to improve relations with the U.S. -- <br>

     CONGRESS OF UZBEK PATRIOTIC SOCIETY. The first congress of the <br>
     Vatanparvar [patriot] organization was held in Tashkent on 23 August, <br>
     Uzbek Television (first channel) reported the same day. According to <br>
     the BBC-monitored report, the organization is the successor to the <br>
     Voluntary Society for Cooperation with the Army, Air Force and Navy <br>
     (DOSAAF). The organization's principal mission, to train youth for <br>
     service in the armed forces, remains unchanged. A report read at the <br>
     congress noted the organization lacked a clear understanding of its <br>
     task now that Uzbekistan is independent. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     talks with Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda in New Delhi on 21 <br>
     August, ITAR-TASS reported the same day. The report emphasized that <br>
     New Delhi and Tashkent's positions coincide on key regional issues, <br>
     particularly the need to find a peaceful resolution of the civil war <br>
     in Afghanistan. Both also stressed their commitment to fighting all <br>
     forms of international terrorism, including what was termed religious <br>
     extremism, and to further enhance bilateral ties. Trade between India <br>
     and Uzbekistan reportedly reached $20 million in 1995. -- Lowell <br>

     FBI IN TRANSCAUCASUS AND CENTRAL ASIA. The U.S. Federal Bureau of <br>
     Investigation plans to double it overseas offices from 23 to 46 over a <br>
     four-year period, AFP reported on 20 August. Among other countries, <br>
     the agency plans to establish a presence in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, <br>
     and Georgia in 1998. This is part of the FBI's effort to create a <br>
     "first line of defense" or early warning system to cope with what it <br>
     considers to be the growing internationalization of crime and crime <br>
     threats to the U.S. The report detailing these plans stressed that the <br>
     agency, whose mission has been confined to domestic law enforcement <br>
     and counter-intelligence, would not be engaged in espionage but would <br>
     liaise with its foreign counterparts. -- Lowell Bezanis<br>

     SALARIES CUT AS PUNISHMENT IN UZBEKISTAN. Uzbek President Islam <br>
     Karimov issued a decree to tie regional administrators' salaries to <br>
     their ability to abide by a June decree to lower cash emissions, <br>
     ITAR-TASS reported on 13 August. Administrators who do not fully carry <br>
     out the decree can be fined 20% of their salary, while those that do <br>
     so will receive bonuses equivalent to 30% of their salary. To date, <br>
     only Tashkent administrator Kazym Tulyaganov and two of his deputies <br>
     have received bonuses, while all other administrators who have dealt <br>
     with this issue have been fined. -- Roger Kangas<br>

     by Uzbek enterprises, President Islam Karimov issued a decree to allow <br>
     the State Tax Committee to confiscate property held by companies with <br>
     fiscal arrears, according to a 13 August Halq sozi report monitored by <br>
     the USIS. In addition, all banks are now required to submit reports on <br>

     UZBEKISTAN'S AIRPORTS TO BE UPGRADED. International sources are to <br>
     contribute nearly $200 million to upgrade the airports in Tashkent, <br>
     Bukhara, Samarkand, and Urgench, ITAR-TASS reported on 14 August. <br>
     According to the head of Uzbekistan's national airline company, Arslan <br>
     Ruzmetov, the reconstruction will make it possible for the airports to <br>

     UZBEKISTAN TO ASSIST REPATRIATION OF CRIMEAN TATARS. Following a visit <br>
     to Ukraine, Uzbek President Islam Karimov has expressed a willingness <br>
     to help Crimean Tatars currently living in Uzbekistan to return to <br>
     their homeland, ITAR-TASS reported on 14 August. The deputy speaker of <br>
     the Crimean parliament, Refat Chubarov, said Karimov will participate <br>
     in the establishment of a mechanism to ensure repatriation. Uzbekistan <br>
     has, up until this point, refused to address the issue. -- Roger <br>

     UZBEK PRESIDENT PROPOSES ARMS EMBARGO ON AFGHANISTAN. <br>
     Uzbek President Islam Karimov has sent an official petition to <br>
     the UN Security Council calling for a general arms embargo on <br>
     Afghanistan, ITAR-TASS reported on 3 August. Pakistan supports <br>
     the proposal, and top Pakistani officials are currently in <br>
     contact with their Uzbek counterparts to work out the details. <br>
     Karimov first suggested such an embargo at the UN in October 1995. <br>

<PRE>2 Points of Mutual Interest:

1.  I believe the ESL Tutor Project envelops the aims and 
mission of the Soros Foundation, specifically the objectives
of the Emma Lazarus Fund. I would like more information on 
how to apply for a grant.

2.  This past summer, I started the International
Partnership for Corporate Volunteerism, an initiative now
adopted by the Points of Light Foundation with the focus to i
involve the private sector, on a global level, in community 
development projects,through volunteerism and philanthropy.  
We are currently focused in Latin America but will expand 
to Eastern Europe in the near future and are in need of a 
contact non-profit organization in the region. This 
opportunity could be of great interest and benefit to the 
Soros Foundation, as we are in contact with multinational 
corporations who wish to invest in Hungary and other 
emerging markets and can contribute to the region's economic
and social development.  Please contact me to continue the
exchange of information and take the next step together.

In all, great website.  Thanks for reinforcing a personal
belief:

Every individual, internally motived by a balance 
of self-interest and altruism, can contribute to the 
development and advancement of the whole.

<PRE>I am pleased to be able to reach Open Society through this medium. I work in Prevention and Education of Substance and have a heard much of your research on Prison in the United States recently, I recieved your request for proposal but it came to late for me to respond. Thank you any in any event
I am attempting to keep my work I have started with Russia and substance abuse, I have been conducting seminars in this area and wish to start a project that deals more with transitions that premediate substance abuse. I am black and in America and saw similar conditions in Russia as I see in America when it comes to crime and drugs.
Wouldn't it be great to make it know that these problems are linked more to economic dislocation and societal breakdown, as well as personal failing. I have education in communication and conflict resolution, as well as working with addicts in prison. So, I am doing work in many different areas in many part of the world. Malaysia, Mumbai,India, Nizhny Tagil, Russia, Zurich, Switzerland, Oregon and Calif. USA./

I especially believe that our "justice" system encourages

laws also are mostly counter productive, tending to put the 
little guys behind bars (because they are easy and make the 
stats look good) while leaving the problem and the big guys
largely untouched.

Programs of Interest:  PROJECT ON DEATH IN AMERICA :<BR>
<BR>
<PRE>I am interested in the Project on Death in America, because 
of my concern about the push for older, sick people to end 
their lives prematurely, either through active means or 
through making it hard for them to get treatment.
  
Younger people, including medical personnel, are beginning to 
look at the right to die as the duty to die.  The refusal of 
heroic medical treatment by older people is seen as a decision 
they owe to the rest of society.

I think life is each person's most important possession, and 
the right to die implies an equally strong, if not stronger, 
right to live.  Many people, for various reasons, may choose 
not to prolong their lives with medical treatment when faced 
with a terminal illness.  But it should be possible for those 
who opt to cling to every bit of life, even in the face of 
pain and severe disability, to get unquestioned backing from 
some group or organization.  This kind of support is now hard 
to find in the churches (particularly among the clergy); and 
it is disappearing in the government, where it is being eroded
by the medical community.  

This is a very recent development.  It could not be found 15 
years ago, at least not in community hospitals.</PRE>

<PRE>I have not had adequate time to explore the website fully,
but will peruse it as soon as time permits.  More than
anything, it is Mr. Soros' past generosity and his 
innovative approach to philanthopy (in addition to our
shared keen interest in Eastern Europe and the former 
Soviet Union) that drew me to the page.  I am a law student
deeply committed to public interest law, having worked
in areas including Soviet immigration, children's rights,
and civil liberties, and would appreciate inclusion in any 
mailing lists you might maintain to keep me apprised of 
Mr. Soros' projects and continued philanthropy.

Best regards,

<PRE>I'm not a teacher,  but have experience teaching
English through a Fulbright teaching assistantship in 
Germany I had last year.  I would be interested in learning more
about programs that would allow me to go to Russia, Poland
or the Czech Republic and teach English.  I'm not sure
if such programs are available through your organization
but I'd be interested in gaining more information anyway.
I admire the work that is being done by your organization 
and find it very important.  I'm frustrated by what I
see as a "me-first" attitude that the U.S. has been
exporting to other countries lately, and would
liek to do soemthing to repay society for the gifts

I can't figure out your selection mechanism above -- my idea will affect all countries.<BR>
<PRE>I saw that Mr. Soros was asking for ideas about how money should be spent. I have two that I
   would make directly to him.(They would bring no benefit to me personally)
I'm the fellow who created the idea behind the film THE TOWERING INFERNO.
That film addressed many criminal and negligent activities affection millions of people trapped and killed by fires.
My father having been a district attorney and having come in contact with serious criminals, I have an idea for Mr. Soros that I think he would find very interesting.
If followed through, they could change the world of criminal justice and have an impact on society that is almost unimaginable.</PRE>

ARTICLE	 - NYTimes December 17, 1996.  ALL RIGHT!  Go, George! Although I teach in one of America's wealthiest communities, my students are largely Hispanic and Eastern European immigrants who receive free scholarship instruments from the school district and from organizations.  They barely have enough of anything.  Even buying a $6.95 music book is more than their parents can afford.  They live in the low-income housing projects - yes, there are indeed low-income housing projects in Greenwich CT - and are some of the hardest working and committed students I have and have ever had.  The idea that the government - MY GOVERNMENT - has wished to take away their meager subsistence is disgusting to me.  Please, if there is anyway I can help, if you ever need a volunteer, please feel free to call on me.  I live in Dobbs Ferry, NY.

<PRE>I have been extremely impressed with the media reports I have read concerning Mr. Sorors' programs.

It is encouraging to know that there is someone with some influence who is 
concerned about crime and criminal punishment; and with the 
state of the current corrections system in America.

Having worked with offenders at both the state and Federal level, 
I am more than aware that what we are doing now is simply not
working, and building more cells will not solve anything.

Thank you Mr. Soros.  I look forward to reading more about you
and your efforts.  Hope to be able to start some programs here
in Oklahoma to meet the needs of the offenders so that upon 
their return to the community, they will be ready.</PRE>

<PRE>I am pleased to hear that the Soros Foundation is allocating 
funds to the area of Death and Dying.  I represent 
The Bereavement Center of Westchester.  We provide a safe 
and caring environment where both adult and child receive 
the special attention and support needed to move through 
the pain of grief towards hope and healing.
The Tree House is our cornerstone program that offers grief
support specifically designed for children ages 4 to 18, 
whose parent has died, and the surviving parent or guardian.
The Bereavement Center of Westchester is founded on the 
belief that every person deserves the opportunity to grieve
in a supportive and understanding environment.</PRE>

<PRE>Using Netscape 3.01 on a Power Mac, the control/shift select
mechanism did not work for me.  I believe it would work better
and be less intimidating if it were done with many fixed items
with independently clicked buttons.

THis is great stuff.  Can I help?</PRE>

<PRE>Athabascan Nation Chickaloon Village has been working toward sovereignty and self determination for many years.  The state of Alaska government does not wish to recognize this and has worked against us at every turn.  They formed the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act illegally because a proper vote of Native People wasn't 
conducted.  Now corporate leaders are becoming extremely wealthy while 70% of the shareholders live in poverty.  We are attempting to make much needed changes.  We will be sending our a special edition of our Chickaloon Newsletter in January to all 7000 Cook Inlet Region, Inc. shareholders to inform them.  We don't even have 
enough money to print the copies, will have to borrow some.  There are many issues, the state keeps appointing our attorneys into other positions so that aren't able to represent us.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.</PRE>

EDUCATION	 - As a psychologist, I am concerned about death. My site points out one way to BEAT certain aspects of death, this in an effective, low-cost fashion.
<BR>
SEARCH ENGINE	 - Mr. Soros's name was in the paper as being interested in  helping people at the point of death, with pain during the dying process, etc. -- terrific things to be concerned about.

<PRE>Please ask Mr. Soros to look at www.immortality-foundation.com and 
find out if this is something he would like to contribute to. 

We now have the means to beat death (in very important ways). From
this point on, anonymous death for the average person may well 
be conquered. 

I'd be happy to chat with anyone at any time about this project.
Thousands of generations hence, I expect that people will be 
accessing this site and learning what people thought, how they
felt, how they faced life, etc.

Yours,

<PRE>Sorry, I didn't study your site, I went directly to this guestbook.
My search of the site was triggered by an interview of George Soros broadcasted on
French TV FR1 Sunday Nov. 3rd (recorded in Paris Nov. 1st with Anne Sinclair and Jacques Attali).
The messages given by Mr. Soros were impressive as is the way he acts in helping
Eastern European countries to overcome 50 years of freedom suppression.</PRE>

<PRE>Please forward this message to Mr George Soros.
Dear Sir,
I happen to see you at Anne Sinclairs "7 sur 7" program
on TV5 Europe. To put it simply, at 9 o'clock you were
the "bad guy", at 10 o'clock you were the "good guy".
Congratulations for the way your are spending your money
and using your position.
To-day there was a good reference on the local TV news
(Finland) about the work of your foundation in Estonia.
Do not get lost in a labyrinth (cf. Jacques Attali) and
keep out of politic parties as you said. You will achieve
much more.
Best regards
Jean-Ren Berg</PRE>

<PRE>Excellent web site for monitoring the latest news on Burma. 
However, there's too much rhetoric than 
actual news. 
My friends and family were among the tens 
of thousands of Burmese who fled the country during the
26-year revolution (1962-1988). The fleeing Burmese lost
everything: money, property, friends, a whole way of life,
a country. Australia alone gave refuge to 200,000 Burmese
during the dark Burmese days.
While all these terrible tragedies were unfolding in Burma, 
the silence from the West (for 26 tortuous years) was, 
unfortunately, deafening.
I have just finished researching  and am still compiling
materials  for a book on Burma's political and economic
history. The main focus would be on the Marxist 
socialist revolution which ended in turmoil in 1988. 
It is a tragedy that Burmese history has been fast-forwarded 
since.   I feel very strongly about this period  
the darkest in modern Burmese history  because there are 
those who pretend as if "nothing happened."
As the (West)German President Weizsaecker said in 1985:...
"whoever is not ready to tackle his own history will not
understand where he stands today and why. Whoever denies
the past runs the risk of repeating it."
I feel that this is exactly what is happening today: 
total denial of the past. 
As such I have decded to write this book. Those Burmese who 
wish to share their experience may contact me at the
following address:
Omar Farouk @ Richard Mookerdum
PO Box 102
Latham, Canberra ACT 2615
Australia.  Phone&Fax: +616 278 3093.

P.S. I hope that Burma Project would help convey this
message to my fellow Burmese compatriots.  Many thanks.

 - I just returned from a conference in Novgorod Russia sponsored by the World Bank, USAID and the Alliance of Russian and American Women. The conference "Alliance for Success: Women in Business" focused on entrepreneurship in Russia. I chaired the session on Marketing and Sales. During the conference I met with Dr. Vladimir V. Bogdanov, Director of SME's Business and Training Centre of Novgorod who told me about the Soros Foundation's project for internet access in Russia. Working for a telecommunications research facility and focused on internet related projects, I was very enthusiastic and curious about your efforts. Dr. Bogdanov expressed interest in my helping his efforts in Novgorod. Should there be an opportunity to work with the Soros Foundation, I would be very interested in talking to the appropriate person. Regards, Ellen Veden

<PRE>We claim to be the world's largest democracy in India, but I am 
not sure how true that is. Several recent forces in India serve to 
undermine Indian democracy; they need studying and standing up to.
I am very interested in ideas of how to promote such an effort. I
would like to see the Soros Foundation take an interest in India,
helping promote the ideas of an open society here too. The very 
presence of a foundation like this dedicated to an open society is
encouraging.</PRE>

<PRE>Very nice these pages.With the Foundation's help I was able
to learn what Internet is and also the most important thing
was that I get in touch with other people all around the world.
I have to admite that this was and it still is the only way
for me and for most of the students here to get across the
border :).It was great but now it's over...:~(.
    Anyway thanx for the Internet programe in my country and
I hope you'll find a way to continue it after the firs of december
this year.

<PRE>I am looking for a Fund Raising Consultant to help raise $100,000 to 
$5,000,000 for this project

Electronic distribution of 1400 FREE books to the 150,000,000 populaiton 
of Russia

Every book we produce goes to millions, perhaps even hundreds of 
millions, of the 1.2 billion computers out there in the world, and 
usually there is more than one user per computer. if 2 million of 
Russia's 150 million population read ONE ofthese 1400 free electronic 
books next year the cost will be $0.05 perbook.
 

 Dobriy utro' (Good morning) i bolwoe spasibo 

NOW EVERY RUSSIAN FREE HAS ACCESS TO COPIES OF 700 AMERICAN BOOKS

In 1996 700 volunteers have been responsible for the creation of 350 new 
electronic copies of books that are NOW available to Russians. Unpaid
volunteers have put 696 books into electronic form since the project
began. By March 1996 book #1000 will be finished. In 1997 total
productivity of books will doubled, to two books per day. Volunteers will
also double with Russians providing translation from English to Russian.
Palms & Company has already identified 650 webservers in Russia who will
provide the translation into Russian. Volunteers have already spent
several months converting books into electronic form at the rate of 64 per
month, during the Spring of 1996 just to insure that in 1997 we would be
capable of accomplishing our goals.  This wealth of knowledge about
economics democracy, private enterprise, fiction etc.,... the knowledge of
the free world is being made accessible to readers in Russia FREE without
costs of paper, printing, freight, etc. 

THE MOST COST-EFFICIENT APPROACH - NO TANGIBLE OR DELIVERY COSTS

For just reading books, the oldest, slowest PC is just fine so access in
Russia can be solved with an XT. "bells and whistles" of the cutest new
Internet things are not very effective in creating a new generation of
Russians. This project is.  There is simply no better low cost investment
than placing the great books of the civilizations of the world into the
hands of everyone in Russia via internet. While presently many are in 
English, they will be translated by volunteers during 1997. 

FINANCIAL HISTORY

Previous supporters have included The University of Illinois, where the
Project was founded. Illinois Benedictine College, Walnut Creek
CDROM Manufacturing Company, as well as other corporate donors. It is now
time to locate budget financing. The project has become too large to
operate from the bookkeeping system of a sponsor. The project has to be
able to pay bills in ways that are not a maze of paperwork so intense that
the founder frequently decides to pay a bill himself rather than do the
paperwork. (These he paid from an inheritance from his father which should 
have been used to pay off the mortgage on the founders house.)

JUSTIFICATION AND MERIT


$100 billion has been spent world-wide in the past 5 years for assistance
to Russia. This project, which will consume less than $100,000 next year,
is the MOST WORTHWHILE activity in Russia in terms of impact, measureable
cost-benefit analysis, and sheer "bang-for-the-buck. It is truly state of
the art education technology. The cost is negligible and infitesimal when
compared to all other programs 0.000001 of 1%

The work itself should create the needed support-- I therefore bring this
most astounding work to your attention. This, the smallest budget item of
any, and which outperforms all other Rusian projects combined in
cost-benefits analysis, should be accorded much deserved budget financing
by at least one of the thousands administering the rest of the money that
is spent for Russia. 


The founder and full time volunteer is not the kind of person who will
stop working on production to get support for it, so I have volunteered to
assist with that task.     

Remember


Every book we produce goes to millions, perhaps even hundreds of millions,
of the 1.2 billion computers out there in the world, and usually there is
more than one user per computer. As Russia rushes "on-line" this library 
will be the greatest contributor to the Spiritual, ethical and moral reform
that is a prerequisite for all other forms of reform
 

Need I say any more.

the funeral industry, I FINALLY find a site which addresses something
more than just the social aspects of death.  Practical information

<PRE>we are interested in seeking support from Mr. George Soros
to fund a partnership with an international Business and 
Development College in the San Francisco Bay Area with an Emphasi
sis on international trade development for the emerging demo-
cracies of Eastern Europe.  The College is a Non-Profit Educa-
tional institution with a 78 year history of working with
foreign students and cultures. It is small serving approximately
125 students primarily from Asia.  We have a wonderful opportunity
to purchase a permanent home for the college and wouldlike
to name the college in honor of Mr. George Soros or the Emma
Lazarus.  We serve a number of foreign students who graduate
and become productive citizens in the US and in their home
country.  I found your website to be very user friendly.

that has so much good information (after a one hour search)
thank you.
you could have had a link to the FIDH report on Total in
burma and the recent controversy in the French newspaper

<PRE>Dear Sirs, As a registered nurse practicing in Texas and 
proud American, I must tip my cap (YES!)TO YOU for your 
support for the passage of Proposition # 215 in California.
There are countless people nationwide that would now consider 
residency in those two states to legally obtain their 
desperately needed medicine! Our government has painted itself
into a corner of no escape defending obvious untruths about
drug policy since President Nixons' Operation Intercept in 
1969. Possibly these referendums are the beginning of a new 
period where we rediscover all the rights and liberties that
were sacrificed in the War on (some) Drugs that by design 
can never be won. Tonite, November 25th, I have learned that
there is a deliberate organised effort to circumvent and 
nullify these voter supported laws by our own law enforcement!
They would lose their justification if other states followed
these referendums.They don't have time to chase the robbers,
rapists and molesters because they don't pay like a loaded 
drug dealer does. Our police are corrupted,our politicians 
can't admit that Prohibition positively doesn't work. As
Superior Court Judge James P. Gray of California stated here
on October 18th on tour in Houston,a promise, a pledge, 
a guarantee that within 5 years after drugs are decriminalised
WE WILL stand together and ask ourselves why we didn't 
legalise them sooner-but why we also allowed so many of our
freedoms to get away because of zero tolerance drug policy.
Sir,I hope and Pray for my four children that you will not 
let these ill people lose what they have won through these 
referendums. There is so much more at stake too for 
our futures.I admire your philosophy very much. I don't
have much hope that you will ever read this message or ever
contact me but I must admit that I feel so much better after
writing it,that I guess that it doesn't really matter anyway
either.Thank You for your time and efforts... America, Where
are You?  America, America, Where have You gone?  please

i feel the same feeling reading this site than a few hours ago when i watched a program on G. Soros on TV :
it's for me a little as a dream ; i find the idea of the foundation usefull, pretty, like some ideas i have, like some dreams.
i think in fact it's like a little part i have in me.
it's a Cendrillon's story.</PRE>

<PRE>Philanthropist Pledges Aid to Immigrants
By ERIC SCHMITT/ October 1, 1996/ The New York Times

WASHINGTONGeorge Soros, the Hungarian-born philanthropist and international financier, said Monday he would give $50 million to assist legal immigrants in the United States. 
Soros said he was creating the new charity in response to the recently enacted welfare law that greatly restricts public benefits like food stamps and Supplemental Security Income for legal immigrants. 
"I am appalled by Congress recent action to deny vital public assistance to non-citizens who are lawfully resident in this country," Soros, a naturalized U.S. citizen, said at a news conference. 
"This is a clear-cut case of injustice and is contrary to this countrys proud tradition of welcoming immigrants," he said. Soros emigrated to England from Hungary in 1947, and to the United States in 1956. 
The money will go largely to pay for the costs of immigrants applying to become naturalized U.S. citizens, and to assist local and community organizations that provide English-language classes and other aid to immigrants. 
More than 1.1 million immigrants have become naturalized citizens this year, and federal officials expect the harsh provisions in the welfare bill to push equally large numbers of legal immigrants toward citizenship in the next few years. 
The charity, called the Emma Lazarus Fund after the poet whose words are inscribed on the Statue of Liberty, will also support organizations conducting legal or educational efforts on the behalf of immigrants. 
Immigrant-rights groups expressed astonishment Monday at Soros new project. 
"Were thrilled," said Donald Kerwin, chief operating officer for Catholic Legal Immigration Network, a public-interest organization based in Washington. "This is probably more money in a given year than all the foundations and state bar associations give out. Its really shocking." 
The new charity is an offshoot of the Open Society Institute and other Soros philanthropies, which spent $350 million in 1995 mostly in countries undergoing the transition to democratic regimes. 
In addition, Soros was one of the early proponents of lifting the siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnian war. He proposed a $50 million aid plan to Bosnia in 1993, but suspended the offer when logistical details bogged down in bickering. 
More recently, Soros has given out or pledged nearly $15 million to help change the nations drug policy. For example, Soros has advocated legalizing the medical use of marijuana, and has been critical of efforts to treat drug use as a crime rather than a medical problem.

<PRE>I am very impressed about the ideas of Mr. Soros. I do share
his expectations about Russia. I was last year there and I
was enormously impressed by the high level of scientific
and human education, things that are of big scarcity in our
country. I had a project for making a bridge between a 
big resources country (Peru) and Science for Russia which
did not work because it was sabotaged. Currently we are
fighting against a suposed "modernization" of our country
that is only favoring more of that governement corruption
that has made our country miserable for more than four 
centuries. Now there are not the spaniards nor only few
rich families ,but a lot of multinational companies that
pay off the governement and destroy all possibilities
for Peruvian entrepreneurs. We do fight, but we fight
in a corrupt judicial system where "money talks". Our
country is getting out of ten years of fanatic terrorism
but what is being done now can bring worst situations
like that. FYI the minimun salary has just being increased
to US$ 90 a month!. </PRE>

<PRE>I'm happy I found this site!  I spent some time yesterday
looking for the Emma Lazarus Fund (I was trying Foundation
instead of Fund) through a general search and couldn't find
it.  I had just seen Mr. Soros on the evening news making
his announcement about it.  This is the first I'd ever heard
of Mr. Soros and the incredibily generous foundations he's
been establishing and funding over the years.  It's such 
important work and so heartwarming to know all the good he's
doing in giving back what he's been given!  

One of the programs I work for trains teachers for Second
Language Education and helps prepare them for E.S.L. state
certification.  There is such a need for it in this area, 
with more and more people immigrating hear from Russia, Asia,
and Puerto Rico, not to mention various other countries.  
We only have 1 full-time faculty member to oversee the whole
operation here.  She has done an enormous amount of work in 
the last few years to see that as many teachers, graduate 
students, etc., and getting the training and experience they
need to meet the challenges that are faced here, as well as
many students coming from other countries to obtain graduate
degrees, which will enable them to go back to their home 
countries and help their people back there with English.  We
experienced many financial cuts over the years, and School 
is always looking for funds to enable faculty and students
to do all they possibly can to train teachers, as well as 
serve the community directly by having student teachers do
direct instruction for ESL. 

We also have a Bilingual Education component in this School,
as well as Reading & Writing, Mulitcultural Education, 
Native American/Indigenous Education, International 
Education, and a number of other programs.

Any more information you can provide that I could
pass on the faculty and graduate students for grantwriting
would be grately appreciated!  Thanks, and keep up the good
work!  Sincerely, Donna M. Brouillet, School of Education, 
University of Massachusetts, 107 Furcolo Hall, Amherst, MA

<PRE>I searched for the Website after reading "Philanthropist Pledges
Millions For Immigrants" in USA Today and referring back to the 
Wall Street Journal Article from July 31, 1996, "Study Finds Half 
of Farm Workers Are Illegal". I am presently trying to organize 
citizenship classes in South Carolina.

I would like to thank Mr. Soros for supporting the immigrant 
community in this country. Over the past couple of years and in
this election year in particular, they have been unfairly 
maligned and used as scapegoats for the political gain of 
elected officials in both the Democrat and Republican parties. 
However, maybe the politicians have, in fact, done the immigrant
community a favor, by making them aware of exactly how little 
political power they actually have and that they can no longer 
afford to be ambivalent about US Citizenship. 

The generous pledge by Mr. Soros will empower the immigrant
community economically and therefore, provide the 
catalyst needed to strengthen their social and political power
in the face of such indiscriminate attacks.

<PRE>Just wanted to express my appreciation for the support of
Mr. Soros in the effort to pass Proposition 215 in Calif.
(Medicinal marijuana).

My daughter has just been thru 6 months of Chemo, and it
was a great help to her physically to get thru the siege.

Many AIDS patients at being treated in the same hospital,
and would be in dire condition without the use of marijuana.

After the ATTY. GEN. closed down the only 'legal' store in 
San Francisco----it appears that these folks will half to
buy it off the street---in a 'criminal' fashion.

<PRE>The website is very helpful and informative about Soros Foundation's goals
and achievements.  I am very grateful that all these organizations exist and 
are functioning to build an open society, especially in a world which is getting
smaller and hopefully more unified.  I would like to hear more from the people
directly effected by these organizations and what their opinions and 
experiences are.  But regarding everything else, I hope more people will find out
about Soros, the man and the foundations, and get involved.  I, myself, am ready
to help and contribute.</PRE>

I congratulate Mr. Soros on his continuing and new work on immigration issues in the US and elsewhere.</PRE>

<PRE>A very interesting web site. I've just been reading a number
of George Soros' speeches as well as his personal statement,
and never realized he was so much more than a just financial
wizard. All of you should work to let the media know more
about Soros the philospher and philanthropist. His messages
about death and open society philosophies need to be more
widely disseminated. I think they are very good and thought-
provoking!

Now what can we ordinary Americans do to further promote
and support the concept and furtherance of open societies,
both at home and abroad? I would like to learn and know more.

Thank you.

<PRE>Soros www pages are valuable tool to research networking in 
eastern Europe. I am wanting to make contact with anyone who
can help with info or contacts on psychiatric mental health
care policy and practice in east European countries. I am
interested in contrasting pre- and post- perestroika policies
, practices and conceptualizations of mental health/illness,
particularly psychoses and schizophrenia.

I think your concept is quite compatible with the Liber-

well-organized and designed in terms of current programs
and staff, but I could find no section where job openings
were announced (perhaps I didn't look in the right place, 
and if so--then the link to the job openings page should 
be more prominently displayed).  

Keep up the good work!  I recently received a visit 
from an Argentinian newspaper editor to my own web 
page "Adventures in Tajikistan!"
(http://ezinfo.ucs.indiana.edu/~birkene/tajik.html). I 
suggested that he visit your site for more information
and news, and he wrote back that it was very helpful for
him and his students in their background work for a UN
report they were working on.

Thanks for listening!  Best of luck...

REFERRAL	 - I am interested in psychiatry as a responsible aspect of an "open society" --- a psychiatry that appreciates the reality of mental illness on the one hand but avoids a facile slide into reductionisms and ideologies on the other -- be they psychopharmacological, psychotherapeutic, or behavioral.  Such reductionisms lead to abuses of psychiatry:  labelling political dissidents, members of new religious movements, and others who are "different" as mentally ill; regarding all mental suffering or even mental inefficiency as mental illnesses, medicating and otherwise "treating" all human problems

<PRE>Very helpful. I am trying to make contact with OSF to see if there can be any support for university library books in Estonia, esp. Tartu University. I spent a year there and it is difficult for these people to adjust to new ways without adequate libraryresources. Through foundations, one can get $250,000 worth of applicable books for $10,000 (as you may know). Please contact me at rlaakan@bgnet.bgsu.edu. Thank you. Ray Laakaniemi.</PRE>

<PRE>Well done.
But actually I looked for for books, articles etc written
by Soros himself. I still did not find but I will continue.
If they are here it would be better to make it more clear.
If there are no, I would place Soros works here or at least
references.
Thank you

positive gains from childrens' work on the internet, which

ALL!<BR>
<PRE>As a Ham Radio Operator, I recently found a new gateway
station in Timisoara, Romania, funded by the Soros Foundation.
I am pleased to see such and endeavour, and would like to
thanks the Foundation, and Mr. Soros, for assisting in
opening up communications with this part of the world. I have
had an opportunity to chat with a local Haqm operator in 
Temisoara, and am now learning many new things about that
part of the world.

This endeavour reminds me of the opportunity I had, now
20 years ago to live and work in Malaysia as a participant in
Canada World Youth, and to learn and live in a completely
different culture, language and religion.

Best of luck in your future projects, and may we continue
to learn that we have a lot to learn, from each other.

Sincerely,

Jim Austin</PRE>

I'm interested in new programs that you've been able to fund through the Society on Death in America i.e. Hospice.  
I'm trying to seek funding to pursue some photographic documentary style projects. I'm currently working on a hospice related story in Virginia. I'm interested in visiting and documenting the Hospice program developed at Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. Ms. McCready has been providing me with information. Currently, I'm doing research to support my grant proposals. Thanks for any information you can provide and for the information you have provided already.

<PRE>I wish such a thorough website such as yours, dedicated to an open society, could lead others to possible employment opportunities in Eastern/Central Europe and Russia.  We all do not have the capacity to engage in major funding projects.  However, many young students like myself would like to partake in, anyway possible, in reform measures in the countries in question.  Every website talks about the tremmendous business opportunities, a "new frontier". I agree, but unless a company/organization has gobs of money to take the risk to invest in these countries, nothing really can be done, or seems so.  What if Soros set up a program for students, grads, etc. to work at the grassroots level of programs in exchange for room and board and the experience?  This would be a profitable experience for both.</PRE>

Hi OSI,

" Burma Debate " is interesting. I think I will join the club sooner or later. 
  Thank you for your support for Burmese democracy movement in such ways and means.  
  I am currently translating a book, from Burmese to English,  written by Major Robert Zan of Karen National Union ( K.N.U ) upon the request of the author. 
  I also have his permission to desktop publish this for non profit purpose. Will OSI help me with this. 
  The title of the book is " Mahn Ba Zan and The Revolution of the Karens " , Quarto size, around 125 pages. Myint Shwe Toronto  ON. Canada
  The author is a life long Karen revolutionary well respected by exiled Burmese circles including Burmese students. The book is about the life and struggle of his dead father, Mahn Ba Zan ( former Cahirman of KNU ) partly biography / partly autobiography. 
  I will appreciate if you respond my request. M.S  Toronto  
 
  WE ALSO INVITE YOU TO VISIT OUT HOME PAGE @ .....

<PRE>I'll have to spend more time here before I can comment.
I just visited tonight to take a quick look around.
I'm interested in stopping the "sub-critical" nuclear 
tests that start in two weeks at the Nevada Test Site 
and the efforts to make Nevada the nuclear repository 
for the rest of the country. If anyone at this site 
can recommend other activist sites or organizations, 
I would be grateful.
Thank You,
Matt Kennedy

<PRE>Daer Madam/Sir,

I have almost completed my MA thesis (title: "Conflict 
Resolution in the Post-Cold War Era. The case of Tajikistan) 
and I would like to thank you for a very useful information,
I found on your site. If your are interested, I'll send you 
a copy of my MA thesis.
It seems worthwhile mentioning that for the purpose of 
writing my thesis I used not only the material from your 
site but also analytical articles from "Survival", "Central
Asia Monitor", "Orbis", "International Security", etc.
Durin my research break in Prague I had a chance to 
interview the OMRI Central Asian analysts as well as the 
broadcasters from the RFE/RL.
This year I've applied for and I've been addmitted to 
the Graduate School of European and International Studies
of Reading University (the UK) for MA in Post-Soviet Studies.
I've also received the Scholarship from the above mentioned 
University and the CEU Supplementary Grant. So, most likely
in 1996-1997 I'll be studying in the UK.

Thank you again.

<PRE>Have not had a chance to explore this site yet. I am interested in the mission of the PDIA as described by Soros. I seek to educate health professionals in the personal issues in death & dying from a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural, multi-disciplinary perspective. I am arranging such a conference in Nashville, TN August 23, '96. Would like to find funding to support this project and to evaluate its effectiveness. My main interest is to get attendees to look at the vaious hats they wear and roles they play and explore how all these impact personal attitudes, beliefs, behaviors and feelings about death and dying.</PRE>

<PRE>I am very excited by the scope of the the OSI activities. I 
have made frequent visits to this site and leave quite 
impressed and encouraged everytime.  I am very curious about
 Mr. Soros.  I read his book and became quite intrigued by
 his ideas.  As I mentioned Mr. Soros spoke at AIESEC's
International Congress in Poland this year.  I did not attend 
but have spoken to several friends who did.  They all wanted
 to know more. Specifically,how does Mr. Soros see AIESEC as
 a prototype for an Open Society.   Perhaps an on-line
 discussion forum about the qualities of open societies
 could be established.  Thank You and if there is anything I
 can do to help please contact me.  </PRE>

<PRE>It's interesting and compelling.  I shall periodically
return to it.  I am anxious to learn more about drug
policy suggestions.  My admittedly naive opinion is
that it makes very little sense to criminalize adult
distructive behaviors and that education seems the most
likely route to success.  I seem to remember that the
_hippies_ were successful in convincing large numbers of
their recreational drug using friends that "speed kills"
by giving believable disinterested information to them.</PRE>

NGO	 - USIC is an abriviation for Utrecht Students In Contact. It was found in september 1995. We want to organise personal contacts between students in NL and ex-Yugoslavia, to bring the different 'ethnic' groups in contact with each other, to initiate within these contacts discussions about things like: democracy, peace and the meaning of ethnicity. We have now contacts with the university of Tuzla, and we want to realize our goals at the lowest possible grass-root level. We want to reintegrate an isolated area, show our solidarity to individual students and make the war and violence more concrete to the students in Utrecht, via confrontation with individual experiences. USIC works in a form which is based on mutual respect and equality with its partners, for more info please contact me.

<PRE>100 students have been collecting items and educating themselves
about the education system in Bosnia.  We've been in communication
with two students in Bosnia via e-mail and are currently sending
them used computer equipment in an effort to continue the
communication.  We've also collected school items that we will
send the first part of June.  This is a small effort but we've
also been speaking about Bosnia within our community of 200,000
and used the press to continue to bring the international ramifications
of the problems to the public eye.  Please advise if there is 
a different level of involvement that we can assume.  Allow 
us opportunities by providing us with information and updates 
and helping us link with individuals in Bosnia.  The 
Connecting Classrooms project can be beneficial on both ends.</PRE>

<center><h4>THE LINDESMITH CENTER</h4></center>  
<center><img align=middle src=line.gif width=600 alt=#"></center><br> <h2><center>Harm Reduction 
Initiatives as Drug Policy Alternatives</center></h2>  
<hr> 
<p> 
<h3>Purpose:</h3> 
To support local, national, or regional initiatives in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet 
Union that address local drug problems through innovative measures based upon "harm reduction" 
approaches and practices.  
<p> 
<h3>The Harm Reduction Philosophy:</h3> 
The Lindesmith Center would like to explain that Harm Reduction is an alternative approach to drug policy 
and treatment, which requires a certain programmatic approach.  Developing drug treatment services can 
be compared to building a pyramid. The mistake often made in the West is that we only built the top of the 
pyramid, offering services requiring abstinence, a commitment most drug users are not able or willing to 
make. Even when free of charge, those services only reach 5-10% of the population, while drop-out and 
relapse are very high. The HIV/AIDS epidemic painfully elucidated our failure to contact a majority of 
injecting drug users (IDUs).  
<p> 
The concept of Harm Reduction entails "the whole pyramid," providing a wide range of services to drug 
users.  When building a pyramid, or any other construction project for that matter, one generally starts at its 
base. In developing drug treatment this translates into a priority on basic, "low threshold" services, aimed 
at improving health and social well-being in a step-wise process, acknowledging any positive change as an 
improvement. Through outreach work, syringe exchange, methadone maintenance, and emergency medical 
care, Harm Reduction services reach 70-80% of drug addicts.  While many of you are familiar with the 
Harm Reduction philosophy, we would like to restate the notion that Harm Reduction does not exclude 
abstinence, but rather it is perceived as one among a wide range of possible preventions. 
<p> 
While Harm Reduction has only been applied within the field of drug policy and treatment for about ten 
years, it is an expression of a much broader social-organizational principle with many mainstream 
applications.  In fact, it is one of the principle models of organization in our society. Seat belts, anti lock 
brakes, airbags, stop lights and traffic regulations are, for example, all part of a well accepted Harm 
Reduction policy to reduce the (considerable) harm from motorized transportation.

<h3>Background:</h3> 
Due to the concern that repressive drug policies may become the dominant way of addressing drug 
problems in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the Regional Medical Program and 
The Lindesmith Center of the Open Society Institute sponsored a meeting of 35 experts mostly from CEE 
concomitantly with the Sixth International Conference on the Reduction of Drug Related Harm, held in 
Florence in March of 1995. An outcome of this meeting was the creation of the new regional program 
described here. 
<p> 
<h3>Developments in 1995-1996:</h3> 
The Harm Reduction Initiatives program, a joint collaboration of the Regional Medical Program, The 
Lindesmith Center and  National Soros Foundations, made available in 1995 the sum of $500,000 to 
applicants interested in organizing innovative harm reduction approaches. Out of 140 applications received 
via participating National Soros Foundations, requesting over $4 million in funding, 30 grants were made 
in 1995, primarily to programs that offer basic "low threshold" services to drug users and projects that 
promote a harm reduction approach to drug use and services. These include: outreach efforts to improve 
the health and well-being of illicit drug-users; methadone and other drug substitution-oriented treatment 
programs; provision and exchange of sterile syringes; training of medical, public health and social workers, 
and criminal justice personnel in harm reduction approaches; attendance at international conferences on 
related topics, evaluation of local drug problems and policies by experts; purchase, translation, publication 
and distribution of harm reduction materials; internet connection; and drug treatment programs that seek to 
reduce drug use and the attendant harms instead of focusing entirely on abstinence from drugs. Other 
measures include training and education programs and provision and exchange of information on drug use, 
abuse, and treatment. 
<p> 
<a href="ceempp.html"><b><i>The Model Project Program</i></b></a><br> 
Of the 30 grants allocated, thirteen projects (four methadone maintenance programs and nine needle 
exchange/outreach programs) have been selected as model projects for the region.  As model projects, 
these programs have been partnered with established service organizations from Western Europe and the 
U.S. (mirror organizations), which will provide targeted programmatic support and ongoing 
communication with the model projects.  In March, 1996, the program held a workshop in Budapest 
designed to bring together international professionals involved in drug treatment and participants of the 
Model Project Program to share information and experiences, with the specific goal of providing support to 
model projects.  Since March, staff workers from the model projects and mirror organizations have been 
visiting their partner organizations to provide programmatic and organizational training to the model 
projects.  Our hope is that in the future the model projects will be able to work independently with other 
programs in their region. 
<p> 
<h3>Current Developments and Further Plans for 1996-1997:</h3> 
<i>Harm Reduction Training</i><br> 
In response to several applications requesting harm reduction training, the Harm Reduction Initiatives 
program has organized a needle exchange and outreach training program to take place during July and 
August, 1996, in four different regions in Central and East Europe in cooperation with the National Soros 
Foundations and colleagues from the region.  Outside consultants have developed a four-day training 
module on outreach work designed to train up to 50 individuals per location in a harm reduction approach 
to working with drug users. The program plans additional training programs for the end of 1996 and in 
1997. 
<p> 
<i>Conferences</i><br>
The program is collaborating with colleagues and National Soros Foundations in Russia, Poland, 
Macedonia, Latvia and Lithuania to support regional conferences that address harm reduction approaches 
to drug use and drug services.  The conferences will address a wide range of issues of interest to medical 
providers, policy makers, law enforcement personnel, social workers, service providers, and drug users. 
<p> 
Pending the review of the grants given in 1995, consideration will be given to the possibility of renewing 
funding, and offering this regional program to countries not presently participating. 
<p> 
<h3>Implementation/Management:</h3> 
The program is a collaborative effort of the Regional Medical Program and The Lindesmith Center of the 
Open Society Institute, and participating Soros National Foundations.  The NY office of OSI launched the 
program and designed the application forms. The National Foundations advertise the program and collect 
the application forms, which are sent to the offices of The Lindesmith Center with their recommendations. 
The Lindesmith Center reviews the applications and designates the successful applicants in consultation 
with the Regional Medical Program.

<Center><h2>Guidelines for Grants as of November, 1996</h2></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>     
<h3>I. THE ORGANIZATION</h3>

The Drug Policy Foundation (DPF) is a non-profit, independent forum 
founded in 1986 to research and publicize alternatives to the war on 
drugs.  DPF believes that the nation should start viewing drug abuse more 
as a public health problem than a criminal justice problem, and should 
focus not on the unrealistic goal of eliminating drug use entirely but 
instead concentrate on reducing the harms associated with drug abuse.  DPF 
aims to change policies and attitudes that demonize addicts while doing 
nothing to reintegrate them into society.  Historically, DPF has focused 
primarily on public education, publishing books, reports, and newsletters, 
producing television programs and sponsoring conferences.  Recently, DPF 
has added a government affairs program to work for change at the federal, 
state and local levels.
<p>
In its nine years of operation, DPF has become the leading force for drug 
policy reform in the nation.  DPF's board includes doctors, policemen, 
mayors and federal judges; its conferences attract reformers from around 
the world, forging links among policymakers, academics, and service 
providers.  DPF membership now exceeds 20,000 paid supporters.
 <p>
<h3>II. GRANT PROGRAM OBJECTIVES</h3>     

The goal of the grant program is to advance drug policy reform, particularly in the United States.  Grants will be made to organizations and individuals to support:
<ul>
<li>Harm Reduction Programs, including but not limited to needle exchange.

<li>Advocacy Efforts that support drug policy reform.

<li>Public Education on drug policy reform issues.
</ul>
<p>

<h3>III. PRIORITIES FOR FUNDING</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Harm Reduction Programs:</b>
<p>
Funds will be awarded to organizations seeking to work with drug abusers to improve their welfare; alleviate their physical, social or mental health problems; encourage non-coercive alternatives to incarceration; or reduce the harms of substance abuse using other creative strategies.
<p>
Grants should be significant enough to enable an organization to launch
a new program (including support of the planning phase), expand a successful program or help evaluate an existing program.  Ideally, the organization would also receive grants from other public or private sources.  In order to determine the effectiveness of initiatives funded under this category, organizations applying should, if possible, include an evaluation component with their proposal.  Organizations submitting applications for needle exchange program funding must include information on the legality of such activities in their state and locality, including information about court decisions, pending legal cases, the position of local law enforcement officials on needle exchange programs and state law.
<p>
DPF's purpose in funding direct services is strategic: to support programs that can create a "ripple effect" -- programs that by their example will advance the cause of harm reduction and facilitate the expansion of such programs.  Applicants should stress how their programs will win harm reduction new supporters and create a more hospitable climate for similar efforts in the future.
<p>
<li><b>Advocacy Efforts:</b><p>

To advance drug policy reform DPF will assist new or existing organizations looking to broaden the policy debate and amplify the voices of those advocating reform.  Applicants seeking funds to do advocacy work must be capable of accounting for these activities consistent with 501(c)(3) requirements.
<p>
Priority for advocacy-related grants will be given to proposals tied to specific reform activities and applicants who show how they will reach communities currently underrepresented in the reform movement.  Among the priority issue areas are state legislative reforms in methadone treatment, medical marijuana, syringe deregulation, needle exchange and criminal law.
<p>
<li><b>Drug Policy Education:</b><p>

Funds will be awarded to assist organizations in educating the public, professions, community groups and other important individuals and organizations in important drug policy reform issues.  Priority will be given to education efforts targeted to strategically important groups who have not previously been involved in the drug policy debate. Proposals should specify the groups or organizations to be targeted, the kind of education to be done, the issues on which the education will focus and the goal of such educational activities.
</ol>
<p>

<i>Proposals not readily falling into any of the three categories above should not be submitted without first discussing the project with DPF Grant Program staff (see below).  In particular, journalistic and academic projects will be supported only under exceptional circumstances.  While there are no formal limits on award levels, past grants have rarely exceeded $25,000.  Indirect costs, to a maximum of 10% of total salaries, may be included when the sponsoring institution is providing tangible support to the project.</i>
<p>
<h3>IV. APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS</h3>

Proposals are currently reviewed two times a year.  To be reviewed in the Summer Round, proposals must be postmarked by May 1.  To be reviewed in the Winter Round, proposals must be postmarked by October 1.  This schedule is subject to change; please call to confirm deadlines before submitting.
<p>
Exceptions to these dates will only be made if:<p>
<ul><ul>
<li>the proposal is of an emergency nature;
<li>the need for the project was not apparent prior to the relevant due
date; and
<li>waiting until the subsequent grant period would render the proposal
moot.
</ul></ul>
<p>
All proposals and correspondence should be addressed to DPF's New York office.  When submitting proposals, please send two copies.  At least one of these copies should be submitted in a format that is easily re-produced.
<p>
<b>Proposals should include:</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>A one-page proposal summary.  This summary must specify the
organization's 501(c)(3) status.  No application can be considered without this
summary, which should  be placed at the beginning of the application.  Summaries
exceeding one page cannot be accepted.
<li>Information on the history and purpose of the organization. (1 page)
<li>A description of the project, why it is needed, and what it hopes to
accomplish.
(3 pages)
<li>Plans for project evaluation and, if appropriate, dissemination. (1
page)
<li>A project budget, including a schedule of expenditures and a
narrative
description of each.
<li>An organizational budget, including a list of other pending grant
applications.
<li>An IRS determination letter (if the applicant is a 501(c)(3)
organization).
</ol>
<p>
The above materials, excluding the IRS determination letter and budget
materials, should not exceed six pages.  Additional materials, such as press clippings and videotapes, are encouraged and should be submitted, if possible, with the initial proposal.

<b>OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES OF<br> 
TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS</b> 
 
<p>In the absence of a sufficient number of randomised controlled trials to draw strong inferences 
about treatment effectiveness, the assessment of the effectiveness of methadone maintenance 
depends upon the results of observational studies of patient outcome. In such studies the 
outcomes of treatment are observed among patients who have assigned themselves to different 
forms of treatment rather than being randomly assigned by a treatment researcher. Observational 
studies of treatment effectiveness comprise two major types. First, there are comparative studies 
in which the outcomes are compared in persons who selected themselves into different treatments 
(for example, methadone maintenance, therapeutic communities, and drug-free counseling). 
Secondly, there are pre-post evaluations of treatment in which a group of people entering a single 
type of treatment are assessed at intake and at some time after treatment, with the effect of 
treatment being assessed by changes in outcomes such as drug use between pre-treatment and 
post-treatment. 
 
<p><b>CONTROLLED COMPARATIVE STUDIES</b> 
 
<p>T he major problem with all observational studies is whether the people receiving different forms of 
treatment were comparable prior to treatment. As a consequence, it is difficult to rule out the 
possibility that apparent differences in treatment outcome arise because of differences in patient 
prognosis prior to treatment. The strategy of quasi-experimentation (Cook & Campbell, 1979) 
provides a way of making cautious inferences about treatment effectiveness from observational 
studies. This involves three processes. First, plausible rival hypotheses are generated which may 
explain any differences between treatments in outcome. Of these the most plausible is that the 
treatments differed in the number of patients who had a good or a poor prognosis regardless of 
treatment. Secondly, patients are measured on variables that may predict a better or worse 
outcome, such as prior history of drug use, degree of criminal involvement, and severity of drug 
dependence. Thirdly, statistical methods of control (e.g. stratification and covariate adjustment) 
are used to decide whether these rival hypotheses explain the differences in outcomes between 
treatments. That is, do the differences in treatment outcome persist when account is taken of pre-existing 
patient differences? If the differences in outcome persist after statistical adjustment, one 
can be more confident that there is a treatment effect. 
<p>The inclusion of evidence from the quasi-experimental studies in a review of the effectiveness of 
any form of treatment is unavoidable, even when there is abundant evidence of effectiveness from 
randomised controlled trials. In order to conclude from the evidence of the randomised controlled 
trials that the treatment under investigation is effective, a quasi-experimental comparison is 
required to justify the inference that the people who have been included in the randomised 
controlled trials are comparable in all relevant respects to the patients who receive such 
treatments in clinical practice. Moreover, a refusal to accept anything other than the evidence 
from randomised controlled trials (e.g. McMaster Department of Clinical Epidemiology, 1981) 
would have the unintended effect of endorsing minimally evaluated treatments for opioid 
dependence. Given the serious individual and societal consequences of opioid drug dependence, 
the community will insist upon offering some form of treatment, and in the absence of evaluation 
by randomised controlled trials, the proponents of all therapeutic approaches have an equal claim 
for public support. 
 
 
<p><b>COMPARATIVE STUDIES OF METHADONE<br> 
MAINTENANCE TREATMENT</b> 
 
<p><b><i>Bale, Van Stone, Kuldau, Engelsing, Elashoff and<br> 
Zarcone (1980)</i></b> 
 
<p>Bale and his colleagues (1980) planned to conduct a randomised controlled trial in which the 
outcomes of methadone maintenance and therapeutic communities would be compared with 
detoxification; however, ethical and practical problems prevented random assignment of subjects 
to treatment. The result was a study that compared the outcomes of patients who selected 
methadone maintenance treatment , therapeutic communities and detoxification at 12 months 
post-treatment. 
<p>There were several distinctive features of this study. First, subjects who entered methadone and 
therapeutic communities were very nearly comparable, as indicated by a comprehensive 
pretreatment assessment. The main reasons for this were that subjects were recruited from a 
common pool of potential patients (opioid-addicted veterans in the Veterans' Administration 
treatment system), and that staff from each of the treatment programs competed for the patients 
on conditions of near equality. All program staff had access to the potential subjects while they 
were in hospital, and subjects were encouraged to spend three weeks in the program to which 
they were assigned before they changed to the program of their choice. 
<p>Secondly, a number of different programs were represented within each treatment modality. 
There were three therapeutic communities with a variety of orientations, and two low-dose 
methadone maintenance programs that were compared with detoxification only, which was 
provided in the main treatment centre from which all subjects for the study were recruited. 
Thirdly, 93% of patients were followed up at six and 12 months. The results of treatment were 
therefore available for almost all who entered treatment, regardless of how long they stayed, and 
not just for the treatment successes. Fourthly, the 12-month outcome was assessed by an 
independent interviewer who was unaware of which treatment the subject had received, and 
efforts were made to validate self-reports of drug use and criminal activity. 
<p>The major results of relevance to this review are those that compared the outcomes of methadone 
maintenance with those of simple detoxification. The comparison between methadone 
maintenance treatment and therapeutic communities -- which failed to find any difference between the 
two in average effectiveness -- will not be discussed. The 
results indicated that the two methadone maintenance programs produced better outcomes than 
did detoxification when measured by reductions in opioid drug use during the past month, and the 
number of convictions recorded during the past year. Moreover, the differences in outcome 
between methadone maintenance and detoxification persisted after adjustment for 10 patient 
characteristics that had been shown to predict outcome. 
<p>A number of issues need to be considered in interpreting this study. First, the methadone 
maintenance programs provided in this study differed from that recommended by Dole and 
Nyswander. Both programs prescribed low doses of methadone and encouraged their patients to 
become abstinent from all opioids, including methadone. Secondly, the combination of a small 
sample size for methadone and the use of crude dichotomous measures of outcome reduced 
statistical power, and hence the sensitivity of the study to detect differences in outcome between 
treatment modalities. Thirdly, those who received detoxification only were entirely self-selected in 
that they consisted of people who had declined any other form of treatment. 
<p>Even allowing for these qualifications, the Bale et al. study provided evidence for the effectiveness 
of methadone maintenance which supported the results obtained in the three randomised 
controlled trials. The methadone maintenance programs produced better outcomes in terms of 
drug use and criminality than detoxification, and this difference in treatment outcome was not 
explained by the covariates that Bale et al. measured. In terms of the quasi-experimental strategy 
outlined above, this study provides qualified support for the conclusion that the differences in 
outcome between methadone maintenance and detoxification were caused by the difference in 
treatment. 
 
<p><b><i>Anglin and Associates</i></b> 
 
<p>Anglin and his colleagues conducted a series of studies in California to evaluate the impact of 
treatment on the behaviour of patients in a number of methadone clinics (Anglin & McGlothlin, 
1984). In each study, retrospective data were collected using a time line technique in which the 
interviewer went over a detailed chart marked with the subject's criminal and treatment history. 
After establishing the date of first opioid use and the date of first dependence, the interviewer and 
subject filled in details of opioid use, criminal activity, and other relevant outcome measures up 
until the time of interview. The authors claim that this technique yielded reasonably accurate, 
retrospective information. 
 
<p><b><i>Methadone Versus No Methadone Treatment</i></b> 
 
<p>The authors originally set out to study a group of opioid-dependent people who were committed 
for seven years to compulsory inpatient treatment as an alternative to imprisonment during 1962- 
64 as part of the California Civil Addict Program (CAP) (Anglin & McGlothin, 1984). Of the 439 
subjects in this early study, 118 later entered methadone maintenance treatment when it was 
commenced in California in the early 1970s. By this time nearly all of the subjects in the CAP had 
finished their first commitment period (Anglin, 1988). Among the subjects who did not enter 
methadone maintenance treatment, two groups were defined on the basis of their opioid use post- 
CAP: a group of inactive recovered heroin users who gave up their addiction during CAP 
treatment; and a group of active users who relapsed to daily heroin use. For the purposes of 
evaluating the effectiveness of methadone maintenance treatment, the comparison group for the 
methadone patients was the active heroin-using group. 
 
<p>Figure 1 is a graph of retrospective time series data that shows the 
percentage of non-incarcerated time that subjects in each of the three groups (recovered, active heroin 
users and methadone patients) were involved in daily 
heroin use. The two dotted vertical lines at 4 years and 8 years mark out the time spent in the 
CAP. The year 0 on the abscissa represents the time of admission to methadone maintenance 
treatment for the methadone group. For the recovered and active groups, the median admission 
date for the methadone group was used to establish the comparative reference point (Anglin, 1988). 
<p>The effect of entry to methadone maintenance treatment for the methadone group is apparent 
when compared with the active group. An increase in heroin use is shown for both groups just 
prior to admission, which was probably due to a dramatic increase in the supply of heroin in the 
USA at that time. Entry into methadone maintenance brought about a marked reduction in heroin 
use which endured throughout the three-year follow-up period. Although not represented here, a 
similar pattern of results was found for criminal activity (Anglin & McGlothlin, 1984). 
 
<p><b><i>Involuntary Termination Of Methadone Treatment<br> 
Versus Methadone Maintenance</i></b> 
 
<p>In 1976 the only methadone program operating in Bakersfield, California was closed. The nearest 
clinic was 70 miles away in Tulare. The closing of the Bakersfield program provided McGlothlin 
and Anglin (1981b) with the conditions for a natural experiment in which the Bakersfield patients 
could be compared to a group from nearby Tulare who were not involuntarily discharged from 
treatment. Follow-up interviews were conducted two years after the closure of the Bakersfield 
clinic. Overall, the Tulare group spent 73% of non-incarcerated time during the follow-up period 
in methadone maintenance compared with 8% for the Bakersfield 
group. 
<p>There were substantial improvements in heroin use and criminal activity reported by both groups 
when the pre-treatment and treatment periods were compared. In terms of the effect of the 
closure of the Bakersfield program, 60% of the men and 56% of the women became dependent 
again, excluding the eight patients who managed to transfer to another clinic. At the time of 
interview, an unexpected urine sample was taken, and the rate of morphine-positive urines was 
higher for the Bakersfield group. Of the 14 subjects who tested positive in the Tulare group only 
two were still on methadone. The Bakersfield group also had about twice the percentage of 
individuals arrested during the follow-up period when compared with the Tulare group. The 
overall outcome for the Bakersfield group was poor: 54% became dependent on opioids 
again, 73% were arrested, 61% were imprisoned for more than 30 days, and two died from drug 
overdoses. 
<p>Anglin, Speckart, Booth and Ryan (1989) conducted a similar study after the closure of the San 
Diego public methadone program, using a similar comparison group. However, the study found 
few differences between people in the involuntarily terminated and continuing methadone 
maintenance programs, largely because a substantial proportion of the San Diego group 
transferred to private methadone programs. Even so, it should be noted that the patients who did 
not transfer had poorer outcomes than those who did. 
<p>Overall, the studies reviewed here by Anglin and his colleagues include two reasonably powerful 
tests of methadone maintenance treatment: a comparison of the effects of the introduction of 
methadone maintenance treatment to a group of opioid-dependent patients with a no-treatment 
comparison group; and a unique study of the effects of involuntary cessation of methadone 
maintenance treatment with a comparison group of patients who remained in methadone 
maintenance treatment. Although the results of both studies showed the expected effects of the 
introduction and removal of treatment, our confidence that these results were due solely to the 
effect of treatment is somewhat reduced by the reliance on long-term retrospective self-reported 
drug use. 
 
<p><b><i>The Drug Abuse Reporting Program</i></b> 
 
<p>The Drug Abuse Reporting Program (DARP) was a large-scale treatment outcome study that 
collected data on approximately 44 000 clients who applied for treatment at 52 drug treatment 
agencies in the USA and Puerto Rico during 1969 to 1973 (Simpson & Sells, 1982). The 
treatment modalities represented by the participating agencies were methadone maintenance, 
residential therapeutic communities, outpatient drug-free treatment, and short-term detoxification 
programs. Another category was created to include those people who applied for, but never 
began treatment. Bi-monthly status reports were received over a year for those clients 
who entered treatment. 
<p>Follow-up interviews took place five to seven years after initial assessment for treatment. A total 
of 4627 subjects were interviewed from each of three annual cohorts for the years 1969-71, 1971- 
72, and 1972-73. Treatment outcome was assessed retrospectively by interviews in which 
subjects were asked about their behaviour during each month between the end of treatment and 
the time of the interview. The outcomes assessed in these interviews were: drug use, crime, 
employment status, alcohol consumption, living situation, and further treatment episodes. 
<p> The findings from the DARP have been reported in a series papers (e.g. Bracy & Simpson, 1982-83; 
Simpson, 1981; Simpson et al., 1982; Simpson & Sells, 1982). In terms of comparisons between 
treatments, patients in methadone maintenance, therapeutic communities and outpatient drug-free 
programs had better outcomes than those who went through detoxification programs or had no treatment 
at all (Simpson & Sells, 1982). This finding was apparent in the year 
immediately following treatment, and was still 
evident, although the differences had diminished, at the five-year follow-up (Bracy & Simpson, 1982-83). 
One DARP study, however, found that these differences in treatment outcome did not persist 
for such long periods (Simpson et al., 1982). 
<p>The finding of the DARP research that is most often quoted is the positive relationship between time 
spent in treatment and the post-treatment performance (see Chapter 9 for an extensive discussion of this 
issue). The length of time spent in treatment was predictive of improved treatment outcome for treatment 
periods of at least one year for methadone maintenance. In general, there was a linear relationship 
between improvement and treatment duration between three months and two years, the longest treatment 
period given the duration of the project (Simpson, 1981). The only other variable that predicted 
post-treatment performance was the pre-treatment criminal history of the person, in which case 
higher levels of criminal activity predicted poorer outcome in terms of opioid use, employment 
and crime (Simpson & Sells, 1982). 
<p>There are a number of problems with the DARP studies as evaluations of the effectiveness of 
methadone. The major problem was that the follow-up data on post-treatment outcome was collected 
retrospectively for the four years preceding follow-up. The credibility of month by month recollections of 
drug use over such a period is doubtful. Behaviour during periods closer to the follow-up period would be 
more reliable, but could be confounded by a number of unknown variables that may have nothing to do 
with treatment, as the authors acknowledge. 
 
<p><b><i>The Treatment Outcome Prospective Study</i></b> 
 
<p>The Treatment Outcome Prospective Study (TOPS) (Hubbard et al., 1984; Hubbard et al., 
1989) was a prospective study of over 11 000 illicit drug users who applied for treatment in 41 programs 
in the USA. The major drug treatment modalities represented by the participating programs were 
methadone maintenance treatment, residential therapeutic communities, and outpatient drug-free 
treatment. All the applicants for treatment in the participating treatment programs for the years 1979, 
1980, and 1981 were interviewed about their drug use, criminality and other behaviour before treatment, 
and were then 
followed up during treatment. 
<p>The purposes of the study were to assess the effect of treatment on clients' behaviour, and to 
identify client and treatment factors that predicted different treatment outcomes. The key 
outcomes measured were illicit drug use, criminal activity, employment, depression and suicide. 
All outcomes were assessed by subjects' self-reports which were validated by a variety of 
procedures. An important feature of the TOPS study was the use of statistical techniques to 
control for the influence on outcomes of potential confounding variables such as sex, marital 
status, education level, age, race/ethnicity and number of prior admissions. 
<p>The study can be divided into two phases. In the first in-treatment phase all applicants for 
treatment were interviewed and followed up every three months while they remained in treatment. 
In the second phase, selected cohort subgroups for each admission year were followed up at three 
months, one year, two years and at three to five years after treatment (the length of the latter 
follow-up depending on their year of admission). 
<p>The results of the TOPS study confirmed those of previous studies in that all three treatment 
modalities were associated with a reduction in illicit drug use. TOPS also confirmed the 
observation that length of time in treatment was an important predictor of post-treatment 
behaviour for some of the outcomes measured (see Chapter 9). 
<p>Methadone treatment had the best retention rates of the three treatment modalities in TOPS. 
Patients in methadone maintenance treatment were less likely to drop out of treatment than those 
in drug-free outpatient and therapeutic communities: after three months, 65% of methadone 
patients remained in treatment, whereas less than 40% of the outpatient drug-free clients and 44% 
of the residents in therapeutic communities remained in treatment more than three months. At the 
end of six months 50% of patients were still in methadone maintenance treatment. 
<p>Patients in methadone maintenance substantially reduced their heroin use while in treatment, with 
less than 10% regularly using heroin (weekly or daily) after three months. Table 3 summarises the 
results of a logistic regression analysis which examined the likelihood of regular heroin and 
predatory criminal activity in the year after leaving treatment (or the past year in the case of 
patients who remained in long-term methadone maintenance) on the part of patients grouped by 
time in treatment. The comparison group consists of those patients who remained in methadone 
maintenance for less than one week. The numbers in the table are odds ratios which can be interpreted as 
follows. In contrast to the comparison group, odds ratios of less than 
one for each of the groups who spent more than one week in methadone maintenance represent a 
reduction in the likelihood of the outcome (for example, heroin use) and odds ratios greater than 
one indicate that the outcome is more likely. When the decreases or increases in the likelihood 
of the behaviour become statistically significant this has been indicated. The logistic regression 
analyses controlled for a variety of potential confounding variables and its results can be 
understood, in simple terms, as representing the patients' outcomes when all other important 
variables have been controlled for. 
<p>As can be seen from Table 3, a significant reduction in regular heroin use was observed among 
patients who spent more than a year in methadone maintenance but who had subsequently left at 
some time before follow-up interviews took place. Patients who left treatment within one week 
of entry were twice as likely to be regular heroin users as were those who stayed for a year or 
more. Similarly, compared with those patients who remained in methadone maintenance 
throughout the period to follow up, the group that stayed less than a week were four times more 
likely to be regularly using heroin. 
<p>Criminal activity was assessed by self-reported predatory crimes such as breaking and entering 
and robbery. Among patients in methadone maintenance, one-third reported committing a 
predatory crime in the year before treatment. This dropped to 10% during the first month of 
treatment. As Table 3 suggests, significant reductions in self-reported predatory crime were only 
observed while patients remained in methadone maintenance. Post-treatment criminal activity was 
predicted by level of pre-treatment involvement in crime but was unrelated to aspects of 
treatment. Methadone treatment, therefore, was associated with a reduction in criminal activity 
during treatment but did not permanently change the behaviour of the more criminally involved 
patients in the post-treatment period. 
<p>TOPS is the largest controlled prospective study of drug treatment to be conducted in recent 
times. It provides information on the behaviour of a large number of subjects before, during and 
after treatment in methadone maintenance, therapeutic communities, and outpatient drug-free 
programs. The use of statistical procedures to control for the influence of variables like client 
characteristics on treatment outcome lends more weight to the findings. The results of the study 
suggest that participating in methadone maintenance treatment is associated with marked and 
enduring reductions in heroin use and criminal activity. 
 
<p><b>PRE-POST-STUDIES OF<br> 
TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS</b> 
 
<p>The interpretation of pre-post-observational treatment studies is even more problematic than the 
interpretation of comparative observational studies because of the absence of a comparison 
treatment condition. Inferences about treatment effectiveness from pre-post-studies are often 
made either by comparing the outcomes of people who dropped out of treatment with the 
outcomes of people who remained in treatment, or by examining the relationship between length 
of time in treatment and outcome. Such inferences are of uncertain value because of the existence 
of a plausible rival explanation of a positive relationship between length of time in treatment and 
patient outcome -- namely, that those with the best outcome (e.g. who were the least dependent on 
opioids, and the most motivated to discontinue drug use) were more likely to be retained in 
treatment. This is a form of 'selection' bias. 
<p>The quasi-experimental strategy can provide a limited evaluation of such alternative explanations. 
First, the hypothesis that patients with a good outcome were more likely to be retained in 
treatment can be tested by measuring the relevant characteristics (e.g. degree of dependence, 
previous treatment history, and motivation to change) of those who do and do not remain in 
treatment. Secondly, if selection bias is operating, statistical methods (e.g. covariate adjustment) 
can be used to discover whether the relationship between treatment duration and patient outcome 
persists when differences in patient characteristics are taken into account. 
 
<p><b><i>Gearing and Schweitzer (1974)</i></b> 
 
<p>Gearing and Schweitzer (1974) provided an independent evaluation of 17 500 patients admitted 
to Dole and Nyswander's long-term methadone maintenance program between January 1964 and 
December 1971. They identified four cohorts by date of admission, which defined changes in 
admission criteria over time, and a shift from inpatient to outpatient induction to the methadone 
program. Outcome was evaluated by changes in social productivity, arrests for predatory crime, 
and mortality rates. 
<p>The demographic characteristics of patients entering the program changed over the period of 
study. The average age declined from 33 to 29 years; the proportion of women increased from 
15% to 23%; and the percentage of whites decreased from 40% to 32%, while the percentage of 
Hispanic persons increased from 19% to 26%. Despite these changes in patient characteristics, 
retention in treatment was high and relatively constant across the first three cohorts who had been 
enrolled for sufficiently long for it to be assessed, namely, 90% after one year, 80% after two 
years, and 75% after three years. 
<p>Retention in treatment was associated with improved social productivity, reduced crime and a 
reduced mortality rate. The percentage who were employed, attending school or homemakers 
increased with treatment for all three cohorts, although less so for later cohorts. The three 
cohorts showed similar decreases in rates of arrest with increasing time in treatment, namely, 
6.5% in the first year, 4.6% in the second year, 3.1% in the third year, and 2.9% in the fourth year. 
<p>The only comparative component of the study was a comparison of mortality rates among 3 000 
patients while in treatment, 850 patients who left methadone, 100 patients entering detoxification 
in 1965, and the general New York population in 1969 to 1970 in the age range 20 to 54 years. 
The rates among patients while in treatment (7.6 per 1000 population) were not substantially higher than 
those in the general population (5.6 per 1000 population) which is impressive given that the mortality rate 
among opioid users is generally higher than that in the general population. The mortality rate 
among those entering detoxification was almost 11 times higher than that of those in treatment 
(82.5 per 1000 population), while those who had left treatment had a rate that was almost four 
times higher than that of those who remained in treatment (28.2 per 1000 population). The 
percentage of deaths that were judged to be probably or possibly drug-related was 50% among 
those in treatment, 80% among those who died after leaving treatment, and 100% among those 
who entered detoxification. 
<p>Gearing and Schweitzer's study is uncontrolled and, with the exception of mortality, there is no 
comparison group with which to compare outcome in the absence of treatment. Nonetheless, 
their results are noteworthy in replicating the positive results for drug use and crime reported by 
Dole and Nyswander in their early reports, and showing that these positive outcomes were 
sustained over four cohorts of 17 500 patients who were admitted to their program over a period 
of eight years. The outcomes assessed were relatively objective, and the advantage in favour of 
methadone maintenance was substantial in the case of mortality where some comparative data 
were available. 
 
<p><b><i>Ball and Colleagues</i></b> 
 
<p>Ball and his colleagues (Ball et al., 1988; Ball & Ross, 1991) have recently reported the results of 
a large-scale outcome study of methadone maintenance treatment involving six methadone 
maintenance programs, two in each of Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York, over a three-year 
period between 1985 and 1987. During the winter of 1985-86, 633 male patients were 
interviewed, and 506 were re-interviewed a year later about their drug use history, their last 
period of injecting drug use, and their past and current criminal activity. The initial sample 
consisted of 113 new admissions and 520 patients who had been in treatment for at least six 
months. At follow-up 388 remained in treatment and 107 had left treatment at some time during 
the intervening year. The characteristics of the methadone maintenance programs were also 
extensively assessed to determine if there was any relationship between program characteristics 
and outcome. 
<p>The findings suggested that methadone maintenance had a dramatic impact on injecting drug use 
and crime among the 388 patients who remained in treatment during the follow-up year: 36% had 
not injected since the first month on methadone maintenance, 22% had not injected for a year or more, 
and 13% had not injected in the past one to 11 months. In all, 71% had not injected in the 
month prior to interview, and the rate of injection among the 29% who had injected in the past month was 
substantially less than before treatment. 
<p>The results also suggested that some programs were more effective at eliminating drug use than 
others: four of the programs reduced 
drug use by between 75% and 90%, whereas around 56% of 
patients in the other two programs were still injecting. Among the 107 patients who had left 
treatment by the time of follow up, 68% had relapsed to injecting drug use. The relapse rate 
increased linearly over time reaching a maximum of 82% among patients who had been out of 
treatment for more than 10 months. Those patients who had been in the less successful programs 
had higher relapse rates than those who had been in the more successful programs. Overall, these 
results suggested that methadone maintenance was effective at substantially reducing injecting 
drug use among the majority of patients, and that some methadone maintenance programs were more 
effective than others in achieving this goal. 
<p>The reduction of crime associated with retention in methadone maintenance also appeared 
impressive. The study sample had an extensive criminal history prior to entering methadone: a 
total of 4723 arrests, with a mean of nine arrests for the 86% of the sample who had been 
arrested. Sixty-six per cent of the group had spent some time in gaol, 36% having been 
incarcerated for two years or more. Although these figures indicate extensive criminal 
involvement, they seriously underestimate criminal activity which is better estimated by self-reported 
crime. 
<p>The sample admitted to 293 308 offences per year during their last period of addiction. Among 
those who admitted committing criminal acts, each person committed an average of 601 crimes 
per year (range 1 to 3588), and had committed criminal offences on an average of 304 days per 
year during their last addiction period. After entry to methadone, the number of self-reported 
offences declined to 50 103 crimes per year and the mean number of 'crime days' per year 
decreased from 238 in the year prior to entry to 69 crime days during the early months of 
methadone maintenance. The number of crime days continued to decline with the number of 
years spent in treatment. In terms of the number of crimes committed, the reduction during 
methadone maintenance was 192 000 offences per year. As Ball and Ross (1991) remark, such a 
substantial reduction in criminal activity among heroin users is usually only achieved by 
incarceration. As might be expected, given the relationship between drug use and crime, some 
programs were more successful than others in reducing crime. 
<p>According to Ball and Ross (1991) and Ball et al. (1988) the more effective programs in their 
study were characterised by the following features: they prescribed higher doses of methadone 
and had maintenance rather than abstinence as their treatment goal (see Chapter 6); they offered 
better quality and more intensive counselling services (see Chapter 8); they provided more 
medical services; they retained their patients in treatment and managed to achieve compliance in 
terms of regular clinic attendance; they also had close, long-term relationships with their patients; 
and they had low staff turnover rates. 
<p>Two important points emerge from this study. The first is that methadone maintenance treatment 
programs differ in effectiveness. The second is that, on average, methadone maintenance 
treatment is effective for the majority of patients while they are maintained on methadone; they 
relapse quickly once they leave treatment. The fact that the sample in this study was restricted to 
inner-city males with long histories of dependence (mean = 11.2 years), and long-standing criminal 
involvement, provided a stringent test of methadone maintenance treatment. It is reasonable to 
assume that if methadone maintenance treatment is effective in this difficult population, then it 
would also be effective with a less troubled group. As was the case with the DARP study, 
however, there is some concern about the reliance upon retrospective self-reports about drug use 
and crime. In the case of crime, the study may have overestimated the impact of methadone 
maintenance in that it compared crime during the last period of addiction with that during 
treatment. This may have exaggerated the difference between the amount of crime reported 
before and during methadone maintenance. 
 
<p><b><i>General Accounting Office Study</i></b> 
 
<p>In 1989 the Chairman of the Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control asked the General 
Accounting Office of the United States Congress to evaluate the effectiveness of methadone 
maintenance treatment programs in reducing heroin and other drug use. The General Accounting 
Office staff selected 24 methadone maintenance programs in California, Florida, Massachussets, 
New Jersey, New York, Texas, and Washington State which had at least 200 patients enrolled, 
and had operated for at least five years. They obtained data on heroin and cocaine use by urine 
analysis from 5600 patients who had been enrolled for at least six months in methadone 
maintenance treatment. This included all patients from 21 programs and a random sample of 
patients from the other three programs. The effectiveness of the programs was evaluated in terms of 
whether 
less than 20% of patients who had been enrolled for at least six months were still injecting heroin. 
By this standard 10 of the 24 programs were judged to be ineffective. 
<p>The General Accounting Office study confirms Ball and Ross's (1991) findings that there was 
substantial variability between the programs' policies. The programs varied widely in the 
frequency with which urinalyses were conducted, in the consequences of continued drug use, and 
in the average dose of methadone. The majority of the programs (21 out of 24) provided sub- 
optimal doses of methadone, as defined by the minimum dose recommended by the National 
Institute for Drug Abuse, namely, 60 mg per day (Schuster, 1989). The mean dose in all 24 
programs was 48 mg of methadone per day. 
<p>Given these differences in policies it is not surprising that there were also substantial differences in 
patient outcomes between programs. The proportion of patients in each program who had been 
retained in treatment at six months varied between 83% and 4%, with an average of 54%. The 
proportion that continued to inject heroin ranged between 13% and 67%, and the proportion who 
injected cocaine varied between 0% and 40%. Secondary analyses of the grouped data by 
Newman and Des Jarlais (1991) suggested that the mean dose of methadone in each program 
predicted both retention and continued illicit heroin use. 
<p>Overall, the results of the General Accounting Office study provide evidence that many 
methadone maintenance treatment programs in the United States are relatively ineffective in terms 
of reducing injecting drug use among those they retain in treatment. Nevertheless, the results also 
provided suggestive support for the Dole and Nyswander model of treatment in that the treatment 
programs that used adequate doses of methadone had the best outcomes in terms of patient 
retention and the frequency of injecting heroin use in treatment (Newman & Des Jarlais, 1991). 
 
<p><b>A COMPARISON OF RESULTS:<br> 
RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS AND<br> 
OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES</b> 
 
<p>The observational studies of the effectiveness of methadone maintenance treatment generally 
support the results of the small number of randomised controlled trials in showing that methadone 
maintenance decreased heroin use and criminal activity. These studies also revealed two other 
features of contemporary methadone maintenance treatment. The first was that there was substantial 
variation between different 
programs in outcomes as measured by treatment retention and continued heroin and other illicit 
drug use, which most clearly emerged in the studies by Ball and Ross and the General Accounting 
Office. The second was that the average results of methadone maintenance treatment in recent 
observational studies are not as impressive as those reported from the randomised controlled 
trials. For example, the retention rates from the randomised controlled trials are usually of the 
order of 70% or more after one year whereas the retention rate in the DARP and General 
Accounting Office studies is approximately 50% after six months. Similarly, the early randomised 
controlled trials reported very little continuing heroin use among those who remained in treatment 
whereas the proportion who continued to use heroin in the General Accounting Office study, for 
example, was as high as 67% in some programs. 
<p>There are a number of candidate explanations for the differences in the apparent effectiveness of 
methadone maintenance between the randomised and observational studies. First, it is likely that 
randomised controlled trials have provided a somewhat optimistic estimate of treatment 
effectiveness. In order to produce clear results, such studies usually exclude some of the more 
difficult patients from entry, and they often have greater degree of control over the quality of the 
treatment that is provided than usually occurs under the ordinary exigencies of clinical practice. 
In addition, in many of the initial randomised controlled trials, patients who were denied access to 
methadone maintenance treatment were unlikely to receive it or any other form of treatment 
elsewhere. The comparison of methadone maintenance treatment with control treatment in such 
studies was not attenuated by the effects of treatment obtained elsewhere, as has more often been 
the case in recent observational studies, such as that of Bale and his colleagues. 
<p>Secondly, there is clear evidence that many current methadone maintenance treatment programs in 
the USA (and, as we shall see, in Australia) have departed from the original model of Dole and 
Nyswander in directions that are likely to reduce average effectiveness. As the data presented by 
D'Aunno and Vaughn (1992) and in the General Accounting Office report show, many programs 
have reduced average methadone dose and put pressure on patients to become abstinent from all 
opioids, including methadone. There has also been a wide variation in the practices that different 
programs follow, and an absence of any interest in evaluating their impact on treatment outcome. 
<p>Thirdly, there have been important historical changes in patterns of illicit drug use between the 
time when methadone was introduced and when the more recent observational studies were 
conducted. The most obvious of these has been the spread of poly-drug use among people 
presenting for treatment. In the USA, cocaine use in particular has become widespread among 
methadone patients. Methadone has no specific effects on cocaine use, neither blocking the 
effects of cocaine nor avoiding withdrawal symptoms, so it has had minimal impact on the use of 
non-opioid illicit drugs. 
<p>Fourthly, the context within which methadone maintenance treatment has been provided has 
changed dramatically in the past 20 years. The Federal financial support for methadone 
maintenance treatment in the mid-1970s has given way in the USA to fiscal restraint on program 
budgets with consequent reductions in the quality of treatment services, and to a steady decline in 
the number of treatment places on methadone maintenance, with no new clinics having opened 
during the past 10 years. This decline in the quantity and quality of treatment in the USA has 
been accompanied by an increase in Federal government regulations that have encouraged the 
reduction in average methadone dose and the introduction of time limits (usually two years) on 
treatment. 
 
<p><b>SUMMARY</b> 
 
<p>The findings of the comparative observational studies of methadone maintenance are consistent 
with the results of the small number of randomised controlled trials in showing that methadone 
maintenance retained patients in treatment and substantially reduced illicit opioid drug use and 
involvement in criminal activity in comparison with those patients who did not enter treatment. 
The pre-post-studies generally agree with the results of the comparative studies in showing that 
the longer patients remain in treatment, the less likely they are to inject heroin or to engage in 
criminal activity. In those studies that have used a quasi-experimental strategy to evaluate rival 
explanations, these results have proved robust. 
<p>The observational studies also indicate that there is substantial variation between different programs 
in their effectiveness in retaining patients in treatment, and reducing their drug use and criminality while 
they are in treatment. Analyses of the characteristics that predict the variations between programs in 
retention, drug use and criminality have generally supported the original model of Dole and Nyswander in 
showing that programs with higher doses, a 
maintenance goal and ancillary services have better outcomes than programs that use lower doses 
and aim to achieve abstinence. 
<p>The <i>average</i> effects of methadone maintenance treatment in the observational studies have 
been lower than those observed in the randomised controlled trials. Among the more important 
reasons that can be identified for the decline in the average effectiveness of methadone 
maintenance have been: a systematic departure from the model of methadone maintenance 
proposed by Dole and Nyswander in the direction of lower dose and time-limited treatment; a 
decline in the quality of methadone maintenance programs in the face of fiscal restraint and federal 
regulations in the USA; and changes in the patient population of methadone maintenance 
treatment programs with the rise in poly-drug use.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b> 
<p> 
An important aspect of the effectiveness of methadone maintenance (MM) is the 
extent to 
which it prevents the spread of infectious diseases among injecting drug users. The 
massive 
expansion of methadone maintenance programs in Australia and other countries in the 
latter half 
of the 1980s has taken place as an attempt to prevent the rapid increases that have been 
seen in 
some major urban centres throughout the world (e.g. New York, Edinburgh, Milan, 
Bangkok) in 
rates of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among injecting drug 
users. The 
two variants of the human immunodeficiency virus are known as HIV-1 and HIV-2. 
The most 
common variant infecting drug users throughout the world is HIV-1, although HIV-2 
infection, 
which is more common in African countries, has also been reported (for a full 
discussion see 
Grmek, 1990). In this book, we use the generic term HIV which, at the time of 
writing, means 
HIV-1. 
<P> 
Although they have received less attention, other infectious diseases such as hepatitis B 
and C are 
also important in any consideration of protecting the health of drug injectors. For an 
interesting account 
of why the hepatitis B epidemic received much less attention than HIV see 
Muraskin (1988). Our discussion will focus on HIV because there is a large and rapidly 
growing 
literature on this topic. While the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) 
poses a public 
health problem without precedent in recent times, we emphasize that it is only one of 
a number of 
serious health consequences associated with illicit drug use (Selwyn, 1991; Selwyn et 
al., 1989b). 
A more detailed description of the health consequences of injecting drug use is given in 
Chapter 5 
where we consider ways in which harm associated with opioid dependence 
might be assessed. 
<P> 
In this chapter we outline the basic facts about HIV and AIDS, and the epidemiology 
of HIV 
infection among injecting drug users. We then review the research to date on what is 
known 
about the sharing of injecting equipment and unprotected sex which are the specific 
risk 
behaviours associated with HIV transmission in this group. Finally, we consider the 
evidence for 
the effectiveness of methadone maintenance treatment in preventing HIV infection 
among 
injecting drug users and its further spread to other sectors of the community. As will 
be seen 
from this evidence, there is good reason to believe that methadone maintenance is the 
best 
available treatment option for preventing HIV infection among opioiddependent drug 
users. The 
implications of the advent of HIV and AIDS for methadone maintenance treatment 
are discussed 
in Chapter 11. 
<P> 
 
<b>THE ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME</b> 
<p> 
Aids results from a person being infected with HIV. After being infected with HIV, 
the first 
clinical manifestation, known as seroconversion illness or acute HIV syndrome, 
usually occurs 
after a period of 3-6 weeks and consists of a relatively mild illness of brief duration, the 
symptoms 
of which include fever, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, night sweats and headaches. 
This acute 
HIV syndrome is usually followed by a period during which few or no symptoms are 
observed. 
After this latency period, which varies between one and ten or more years, a 
progressive 
deterioration of immune functioning is observed which manifests itself in a variety of 
infections 
which are usually resisted by a healthy individual. As Sobel (1991) points out, it is too 
early in the 
course of the epidemic for the maximum length of the latency period to have been 
determined. 
<P> 
Although the clinical course is different in each case, some people may develop a series 
of 
relatively minor infections like oral thrush or candidiasis, and a range of other 
symptoms, typically 
fatigue and weight loss, as their immune system progressively loses its capacity to resist 
infection. 
A person is said to have AIDS when they manifest one of a number of serious illnesses 
such as 
pneumocystis pneumonia or Kaposi's sarcoma. Death usually results from a 
combination of such 
infections (for more detail about the clinical manifestations of AIDS among injecting 
drug users 
see Glasner & Kaslow 1990; McCutchan, 1990; Sobel, 1991). 
<P> 
AIDS first came to the attention of physicians in Los Angeles and New York in 1980, 
although it 
has now been established through retrospective searching of medical records and 
testing of stored 
sera that there were cases before 1980. Epidemiological research to date suggests that 
HIV has 
been present in human populations for some time, but that a number of societal and 
technological 
changes have created the conditions for its global epidemic spread. According to 
Grmek (1990), 
these changes include: the invention of the hypodermic syringe; the discovery of blood 
types early 
this century and the ensuing ability to transfuse blood; the increase in international 
travel afforded 
by developments in transport; and the liberalization of sexual life and drug use during 
the 1960s. 
At the time of writing, infection with HIV has been reported among injecting drug 
users in 30 
countries throughout the world (Des Jarlais, 1992a). 
<P> 
<b><i>The Epidemiology of HIV Among Injecting Drug Users</i></b> 
<p> 
 
There are three main modes of transmission of HIV: through the introduction of HIV- 
infected 
blood or blood products into the body by practices such as transfusing blood products 
and 
injecting with HIV-contaminated needles and syringes; through the exchange of HIV- 
infected 
body fluids during unprotected sex; and by being passed from mother to child during 
pregnancy or 
birth, and perhaps via breast milk during feeding (Glasner & Kaslow, 1990). Certain 
practices 
such as sharing injection equipment and unprotected sexual intercourse have been 
shown to be 
important risk factors in the spread of HIV (Turner et al., 1989). 
<P> 
After homosexual men, injecting drug users constitute the second largest infected 
group in most 
Western countries, and in some countries (e.g. Italy and Spain) are the largest group 
(Friedman & 
Des Jarlais, 1991). As a group, they are potentially at risk for both sexual and 
parenteral HIV 
transmission. Their sexual partners are at risk if they practice unsafe sex, and children 
born of 
these relationships are also at risk for perinatal transmission. As will be seen below, 
there is ample 
evidence to suggest that injecting drug users are a potential source 
for HIV infection for the noninjecting drug-using population via sexual transmission 
of the virus. 
<P> 
Des Jarlais et al. (1989) have divided the introduction of HIV into a defined risk group 
into three 
phases: an introductory phase in which HIV is introduced and begins to spread; a rapid 
spreading 
phase during which the virus spreads rapidly among the group members (if facilitating 
conditions 
exist); and a stabilization phase during which the incidence of HIV infection levels out. 
In New 
York, for example, HIV was probably introduced among injecting drug users as early 
as 1975. 
After that, the incidence of HIV increased slowly until 1978 (introductory phase), 
when it spread 
rapidly among the group until 1981 (rapid spreading phase), after which the rates of 
HIV infection 
leveled out. During the rapid spreading phase, the percentage of infected drug users 
went from 
approximately 20% to 50% (Des Jarlais et al., 1989). The seroprevalence rate has since 
remained 
at around 50-60%. Similar rates of spread among injecting drug users have been 
observed in 
many other areas throughout the world (see Des Jarlais, 1992a). Des Jarlais et al. 
(1989) have 
argued that it is important that attempts to prevent the spread of HIV be put in place 
before the 
onset of this rapid spreading phase, because it appears that once infection reaches a 
critical level 
in a given population of drug injectors, and given the right conditions, it only takes a 
short period 
of time for it to reach epidemic proportions. 
<P> 
According to Des Jarlais (1992a), two conditions that allow for the rapid spread of 
HIV are: a) 
low levels of appreciation of the risks associated with AIDS and injecting behaviour; 
and b) 
frequent sharing of injecting equipment with multiple sharing partners, such as occurs 
in 'shooting 
galleries' and the houses of drug dealers who provide injecting equipment at the time 
of purchase. 
Friedman and Des Jarlais (1991) have noted that those areas where HIV has spread 
most rapidly 
are those where heroin is the major drug of injection, though they also note that this 
may simply 
be due to a lack of information about the epidemiology of HIV among injecting drug 
users in 
countries where cocaine is the major drug of injection. 
<P> 
Rapid spread of HIV is by no means inevitable. In some cities, infection rates appear 
to have 
stabilized at much lower levels (e.g. San Francisco where it remains at around 12%). 
Friedman 
and Des Jarlais (1991) suggest a number of reasons why these differences have 
occurred: the 
differential effectiveness of HIV prevention efforts; the extent to which injecting drug 
users have 
changed their risk behaviours; the time at which HIV was introduced to a given 
population of drug users 
and, more critically, its relationship to the discovery of the transmission 
characteristics of the virus and the ensuing risk reduction campaigns; and local 
variations in the 
rituals and lifestyle associated with drug injecting. 
<P> 
Socio-economic factors and ethnicity are important in any characterization of the HIV 
epidemic 
among injecting drug users. In the USA, for example, black and Hispanic users have 
far higher 
rates of HIV infection than do white drug users (Friedland, 1989). The association 
between 
membership in these two groups and socioeconomic deprivation is important. As 
Friedman and 
Des Jarlais (1991) observe, socioeconomic disadvantage is not only a discernible risk 
factor for 
HIV infection but for injecting drug use as well. Ultimately, reducing injecting drug 
use, and 
therefore risk of HIV infection, among disadvantaged populations requires larger scale 
interventions than drug treatment programs can offer. 
<P> 
In Australia, HIV infection among injecting drug users has been surveyed in a number 
of ways. 
Wodak et al. (1987) in a study to determine the presence of HIV antibodies in needles 
and 
syringes exchanged in Sydney in late 1986 and early 1987 found that 1% contained 
infected 
blood. In a similar study conducted in the same city during July and August 1987, 3% 
of the 
syringes returned were found to be contaminated (Wolk et al., 1988). More recent 
estimates 
suggest that around 3% to 6% of injecting drug users in urban centres in Australia are 
HIV 
seropositive (Darke et al., 1992; Morlet et al., 1990; Ross et al., 1991). Finally, 4% of 
reported 
AIDS cases in Australia have injecting drug use identified as a risk factor (National 
Centre on 
HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research, 1991). 
<P> 
There is as yet no cure for AIDS. The only means available to deal with HIV, 
therefore, is by 
eliminating or modifying the risk behaviours involved in its transmission (Becker & 
Joseph, 1988; 
Kelly & Murphy, 1991). In the case of injecting drug use, these changes amount either 
to 
abstinence or, if that goal is not feasible, to either changing the route of ingestion of 
the drug (say 
to smoking or swallowing) or to safer injecting, which means not sharing injecting 
equipment or 
properly cleaning this equipment if the user continues to share. As Becker and Joseph 
(1988) 
have pointed out, abstinence for life might seem an attractive option, but encouraging 
modification of injecting practices is more likely to be effective for many drug users. 
They argue 
that the consequences of not adopting measures that take into account likely 
behaviour change 
could be disastrous. It is possible that a limited number of quite active, infected 
individuals could 
maintain and perhaps increase the incidence of infection among injecting drug users. 
<P> 
Methadone maintenance is an intervention that takes into account what is achievable 
with this population. 
It provides an orally ingested alternative to 
injected opioids such as heroin, which makes it an attractive option for opioid users 
who are not 
prepared, or who are unable, to become abstinent. This means that a reduction is 
achieved in the 
risks associated with the use of opioids without requiring abstinence on the part of the 
drug user. 
Other advantages are that methadone maintenance programs can also function as 
dissemination 
points for education about HIV and AIDS and provide contact with the health care 
system for 
those injecting drug users who are already infected. 
<P> 
<b>HIV RISK BEHAVIOURS:<br> 
INJECTING AND NEEDLE SHARING</b> 
 <p> 
HIV is transmitted via injecting drug use through the sharing of injection equipment 
that has been 
contaminated with HIV-infected blood. As we have already stated, needle sharing has 
been and 
remains a common practice among injecting drug users, albeit at a lower prevalence 
than was the 
case before HIV. With the advent of HIV and the ensuing public health campaigns to 
reduce HIV 
risk-taking behaviours, reductions in needle sharing have been reported in both the 
USA and in 
Europe (e.g. Des Jarlais et al., 1989; Durante, 1991; Harris et al., 1990; Kall & Olin, 
1990; Klee 
et al., 1990a; Power et al., 1988; Ronald et al., 1992; Selwyn et al., 1987). Contrary to 
popular 
images of being irresponsible, out-of-control individuals, injecting drug users have 
responded 
positively to AIDS awareness and risk reduction campaigns (Friedland, 1989). 
However, as the 
evidence below shows, some drug users continue to share needles and therefore 
continue to 
expose themselves and others to the risk of being infected. In this section, we consider 
under 
what circumstances injecting risk behaviours occur and what, if anything, can be said 
about those 
users who continue to engage in these risk behaviours. 
<P> 
In Australia, studies that have surveyed the needle sharing practices of injecting drug 
users have 
found it to be a common practice. Morlet et al. (1990), in a survey of users attending 
the Albion 
Street (AIDS) Centre in Sydney, found that 87% of the sample had shared injecting 
equipment at 
some time in their lives. Wolk et al. (1990a) found similar rates, with 80% having 
shared in their 
current drug use period and 74% of these having shared with more than one person. 
Darke et al. 
(1990) report a rate of 40% having shared in the month prior to interview and 24% of 
these having shared 
with more than one other person. These figures are consistent with prevalence 
studies of hepatitis B and C among this population, where high rates (89% and 86% 
respectively) 
suggest that most injecting drug users have shared needles at some time in the past (Bell 
et al., 
1990c). 
<P> 
If drug users do share needles, then the cleansing procedures they use are an important 
determinant of the probability of transmitting HIV. Rinsing the injecting equipment 
with bleach 
has been the most commonly recommended decontamination procedure if it is 
necessary to share 
at all (e.g. see Newmeyer, 1988). It is disturbing then to note that Wolk et al. (1990a) 
found that 
even though 86% of the needle sharers cleaned used needles before injecting with 
them, 80% of 
this group rinsed at some time with water, 8% with alcohol, and only 30% boiled the 
equipment. 
The authors note that the interviews were conducted before the campaign to educate 
users about 
the need to rinse shared needles with bleach. However, the Darke et al. (1990) study, 
which was 
conducted after this campaign, found that even though 89% of sharers rinsed before 
injecting, 
only 15% of this group had used bleach. Darke (in press), in a review of the literature 
on HIV 
and injecting drug use, has found that the low levels of cleaning with bleach found in 
Australia are 
similar to findings in the USA (with the exception of San Francisco) and Europe. 
<P> 
<b><i>Risk Factors Associated With HIV Infection</i></b> 
 <p> 
A number of factors have been associated with an increased risk for contracting HIV 
through 
needle sharing. The frequency with which the user injects has been found to be 
associated with 
HIV seropositivity (e.g. Chu, et al., 1989; Schoenbaum et al., 1989). Duration of 
injecting drug 
use has also been associated with being HIV positive (Chu et al., 1989; Schoenbaum et 
al., 1989), 
although this presumably reflects the relationship between the time of beginning 
injecting and the 
advent of risk reduction campaigns among injecting drug users. Related to frequency 
of injecting 
is the issue of poly-drug use. Dolan et al. (1987), in an American study, found that 
drug users 
who used multiple drugs were more likely to ,share, as did Klee et al. (1990b) in an 
English study. 
Darke et al. (1990) also found that poly-drug use was associated with greater needle 
sharing in 
their study of Sydney injecting drug users. One drug that has been associated with 
more frequent 
injecting and needle sharing is cocaine (Chaisson et al., 1989; Darke et al., 1992; 
Schoenbaum et 
al.' 1989; Torrens et al., 1991). Cocaine has a much shorter elimination half-life than 
heroin, 
meaning that it has to be injected more frequently to maintain its effects. A history of 
cocaine 
abuse has been found to be associated with being HIV positive in the United States 
(Chaisson et al. 
1989; Schoenbaum et al., 1989). 
<P> 
<b><i>The Dynamics of Needle Sharing</i></b> 
 <p> 
Injecting drug users share injection equipment for a variety of reasons. Not being in 
possession of 
a new needle and syringe at a time when illicit drugs are available leads users to either 
share their 
equipment with each other, or to use old equipment that they already have in their 
possession 
(Klee et al., 1990a; McKeganey et al., 1989; Selwyn et al., 1987). Users who report 
greater 
difficulty in tolerating withdrawal symptoms are also more likely to share (Magura et 
al., 1989a). 
This group of users appears to be willing to inject with used equipment rather than 
tolerate the 
period of withdrawal necessary until clean equipment can be obtained. As might be 
expected, the 
easy availability of clean injecting equipment has been found to be associated with 
reductions in 
needle sharing (e.g. Calsyn et al., 1991a). 
<P> 
A number of social factors have also been found to increase the incidence of needle 
sharing. 
Having a partner or friends who inject has been a factor associated with needle sharing 
(Klee et 
al., 1990a; Magura et al., 1989a). A number of important features of this variable have 
also been 
isolated. Sharing needles with family members, sexual partners and friends has been 
shown to 
function as a sign of bonding (Magura et al., 1989a; McKeganey et al., 1989). With 
sexual 
partners, who often do not regard their sharing as 'true' sharing, injecting each other 
may be an 
expression of intimacy (Turner et al., 1989). Peer pressure is an important component 
of the 
renewal of family and friendship bonds and has been reported to contribute to 
continued needle 
sharing (Magura et al., 1989a). Peer pressure is also reported to be felt by some users in 
the form 
of a duty to help other users who need their equipment to inject (McKeganey et al., 
1989). In a 
study of the impact of needle exchanges on sharing in north west England, Klee et al. 
(1991a) 
found that injectors who did not use the exchanges put pressure on those who did to 
share their used 
equipment. 
<P> 
New users and irregular injectors are two groups who are also at risk because clean 
injecting 
equipment is usually unavailable at the time of use even in areas where such equipment 
is available 
through needle and syringe exchanges. New users are usually initiated into injecting 
by 
experienced users who teach the injection skills necessary to successfully inject oneself 
(Turner et 
al., 1989). Usually, the skilled injector will inject the new initiate. Lacking their own 
equipment, 
new injectors are dependent upon the equipment of experienced users. Irregular 
injectors are 
unlikely to have equipment in their possession because their drug use is often 
unplanned and dependent 
on circumstance. In a study of drug users who use needle exchanges and those who do 
not, Hartgers 
et al., (1989) found that irregular drug use was associated with not using needle 
exchanges and 
with more needle sharing. This is consistent with the evidence above concerning the 
unavailability 
of injection equipment as a reason for sharing. In the Wolk et al. (1990a) study, 19% 
of those 
who shared said they did so because of an unplanned decision to use drugs. As well as 
these two 
kinds of users, Klee et al. (1990a) found that homeless drug injectors tended to share 
more than 
other drug users, a finding that has been reported elsewhere (Siegal et al., 1991). 
<P> 
<b><i>Characteristics of Needle Sharers</i></b> 
<p> 
 
There is growing evidence that a sub-group of drug users continue to share injecting 
equipment 
even though they know the risks associated with it (Selwyn et al., 1987; Wolk et al., 
1990a). 
Some research has tried to determine if there are any definable characteristics of this 
group. 
Dolan et al. (1987) interviewed 224 males to identify variables that discriminated 
between sharers 
and non-sharers. They found that those subjects who had more severe drug problems 
and who 
used more drugs were more likely to share needles, even though they knew the risks 
involved. 
They rejected the notion that sharers had a particular personality profile or any 
specifiable 
psychopathology because of an absence of an association between sharing and subjects' 
scores on 
the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, an instrument that is used for 
measuring 
personality variables. 
<P> 
Studies using more specific diagnostic criteria have, however, suggested otherwise. 
Nolimal and 
Crowley (1989) and Brooner et al. (1990) found that users with a diagnosis of antisocial 
personality disorder, a disorder frequently associated with illicit drug use, were more 
likely to 
share than other users. This finding suggests that users who fit into this diagnostic 
category may 
be less responsive to AIDS education aimed at changing behaviour when it is 
considered along 
with other evidence that has found that clients with antisocial personality disorder do 
not respond 
well to treatment (Brooner et al., 1990). Metzger et al. (1991) have also found 
psychiatric 
diagnosis to be associated with needle sharing, with methadone maintenance patients 
who were 
more depressed or who had more severe psychiatric problems overall being more 
likely to share. 
Antisocial personality disorder and other co-morbid psychiatric states are discussed in 
more detail 
in Chapters 8 and 13. 
<P> 
One other factor that has been found to be related to needle sharing is the concomitant 
use of 
benzodiazepines. In a study of HIV risk behaviour recently 
conducted in the north west of England, it was found that the tranquilizer temazepam 
was 
associated with needle sharing (Klee et al., 1990b). Temazepam users used more types 
of drugs, 
shared more often and had shared more recently than other drug users, including those 
who used 
tranquilizers other than temazepam. Temazepam users also had less friends and were 
involved in 
criminal activity to a greater extent. This association between the use of 
benzodiazepines has 
been found in other studies (Darke et al., forthcoming; Metzger et al., 1991). 
<P> 
<b>HIV RISK BEHAVIOURS: SEX</b> 
 <p> 
The sexual transmission of HIV takes place through the exchange of body fluids that 
occurs during 
unprotected penetrative sex - that is, penile penetration of the vagina or anus (and 
perhaps the 
mouth if ejaculation takes place) without a condom. In the general population, the 
type and 
number of unsafe sexual contacts is known to be important in the spread of HIV 
(Turner et al., 
1989). Injecting drug users who engage in needle-sharing behaviours are an important 
risk factor 
for their sexual partners. This risk of heterosexual transmission was identified early on 
in the 
epidemic (Sobel, 1991) and confirmed in findings like those of Schoenbaum et al. 
(1989) who 
found in a New York study that heterosexual contact with an injecting drug user was a 
risk factor 
for being infected with HIV. 
<P> 
Almost nothing is known about the sexual behaviour of injecting drug users as a 
group. This 
reflects a similar state of affairs concerning the general population (Turner et al., 1989). 
The 
frequency of specific types of sexual behaviours and the number and frequency of 
sexual contacts 
for most definable social groups is unknown. This lack of knowledge makes the 
prediction of the 
spread of HIV difficult. What is known to date concerning the sexual behaviour of 
drug users and 
the risk for HIV is reviewed below, outlining first the risk factors associated with 
sexual 
behaviour and then factors that have been found to be associated with increased or 
continued risk 
taking. 
<P> 
<b><i>The Sexual Behaviour of Injecting Drug Users</i></b> 
 <p> 
Injecting drug users have been found consistently to be a sexually active group in the 
USA, Europe and 
Australia (Darke et al., 1990; Donoghoe et al., 1989; 
Feucht et al., 1990; Klee et al. 1990c; van den Hoek et al., 1990; Wolk et al., 1990a). 
Sexually 
active injecting drug users report high levels of unsafe sex, considerable casual sex, and 
high rates 
of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Focusing on the Australian evidence, 69% of 
the 
sexually active subjects surveyed by Wolk et al. (1990a) reported very low or no use of 
condoms. 
Many of the subjects had had more than one sexual partner in the recent past. This 
finding is 
consistent with overseas findings concerning low condom usage and multiple sexual 
partners 
among many injecting drug users (e.g. Donoghoe et al., 1989; Durante, 1991; Lewis et 
al., 1990; 
Magura et al., 1990a). 
<P> 
<b><i>Prostitution</i></b> 
 <p> 
Prostitution is a common way for female, and to a lesser extent male, drug users to 
support their 
drug use. Wolk et al. (1990a) found that 13% of males and 41% of females had worked 
as 
prostitutes since 1981, and 13% of the subjects interviewed were currently engaged in 
prostitution. Ten per cent of the Darke et al. (1990) sample and 15.5% in the Morlet et 
al. (1990) 
study reported current prostitution. Because prostitutes tend to have high numbers of 
sexual 
contacts, the use of condoms by this group is of interest. Overall the evidence suggests 
that sex 
industry workers have responded to the advent of HIV, and groups organised by sex 
workers 
themselves have been important in the widespread adoption of safe sex practices at 
work (see 
Donoghoe, 1992). It has been found, however, that drug injecting prostitutes use 
condoms at 
work but not with their regular sexual partners (Darke et al., 1990; Klee, et al., 1990a; 
Turner et 
al., 1989; van den Hoek et al., 1989; Wolk et al., 1990a). Van den Hoek et al. (1989) 
pointed 
out, however, that in their study most of these private sexual partners tended to be 
injecting drug 
users themselves, which may constitute a high risk if either party has been sharing 
injecting 
equipment. 
<P> 
Two findings suggest that prostitution may still be of concern. Bellis (1990) found low 
condom 
use by drug injecting prostitutes who worked the streets in five southern Californian 
cities. None 
of the subjects in this study was in any form of drug treatment. It may be that it is 
those 
prostitutes who are not in any form of drug treatment, and who work at the lower end 
of the 
market (e.g. on street corners), who may be under more pressure to engage in unsafe 
sex. The 
other finding of concern is that of Van den Hoek et al. (1989) who, in their study of 
drug injecting 
prostitutes in Amsterdam, found that although the group as a whole reported 
reasonable use of 
condoms at work, 81% had reported contracting STD in the six months prior to 
interview. This anomaly 
suggests that self-reported rates of 
unsafe sex may not always be accurate. The main risk factor for HIV infection among 
the 
prostitutes in their study remained injecting drug use. 
<P> 
<b><i>Other Sexually Transmitted Diseases<br> 
Among Injecting Drug Users</i></b> 
<p> 
 
A high incidence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) within a group is a strong 
indicator that 
the group is engaging in high levels of unsafe sex (van den Hoek et al., 1990). Injecting 
drug 
users in Sydney have high rates of reported infection with STDs (Morlet et al., 1990; 
Ross et al., 
1991). Half of the Morlet et al. (1990) sample and just over one-third of the males and 
one-half 
of the females in the Ross et al. (1991) study reported having an STD at some time in 
their life. 
Besides indicating high levels of unsafe sex, these findings are of concern because 
ulcerative 
genital lesions are thought to heighten the risk of HIV transmission during sexual 
intercourse and 
have been found to be associated with HIV seropositivity among injecting drug users 
(Morlet et 
al., 1990; Trapido et al., 1990; van den Hoek et al., 1989). 
<P> 
<b><i>Homosexual and Bisexual Males</i></b> 
 <p> 
Homosexual and bisexual male injecting drug users who engage in unsafe sex are at 
greater risk 
for infection with HIV. They have higher rates of HIV infection and STDs than male 
heterosexual and female drug users who have approximately equal rates (Morlet et al., 
1990; Ross 
et al., 1991). The differential rates of infection for HIV for each of these groups are 
similar to 
those found in the general population. Homosexual men tend to have higher rates of 
infection 
with HIV than bisexual men, who in turn have higher rates than heterosexual men 
(Ross et al., 
1991). 
<P> 
<b><i>actors Associated With Unsafe Sex</i></b> 
 <p> 
Some factors have been found to be associated with an increase in unsafe sex. Darke et 
al. (1990) 
found that younger injecting drug users tend to engage in more unsafe sex than older 
users. Both 
Klee et al. (1990a) in the United Kingdom and Loxley et al., (1991) in Western 
Australia have 
found that younger users also tend to have more casual sex. As with needle sharing, 
the use of 
temazepam (Klee et al., 1990b), antisocial personality disorder (Brooner et al., 1990; 
Nolimal & 
Crowley, 1989) and being homeless (Klee et al., 1990a) are associated with having more 
sexual 
partners and not using condoms. Partner pressure has been found to be another 
important factor 
in condom use. The extent to which a patient perceives their partner to be receptive 
to suggestions about 
safe sex has been found to be related to level of condom use (Magura et al., 1990). 
<P> 
Although injecting drug users are, at this point in time, primarily at risk because of 
their injection 
practices, they do provide the most important transmission bridge to the heterosexual 
population 
at large. In the USA, just over 60% of AIDS cases reported in women for the two 
years April 
1987 to March 1988 and April 1988 to 1989 had heterosexual contact with an injecting 
drug user 
as the suspected route of HIV transmission (Feucht et al., 1990). In New York, which 
has the 
highest concentration of injecting drug users in the USA, sexual contact with an 
injector was the 
source of 90% of cases of heterosexually transmitted AIDS and of 80% of the cases of 
maternal 
transmission (New York City Department of Health, 1988 cited in Des Jarlais et al., 
1990). Many 
injecting drug users have non-injecting sexual partners and, given the above evidence 
about high 
rates of unsafe sex, could become the maijor source for heterosexual transmission in 
other parts 
of the world (Abdul-Quader et al., 1987; Donoghoe et al., 1989; Klee et al, 1990c). 
Reports 
concerning the differences in risk for males and females with regard to heterosexual 
transmission 
of HIV are misleading when it comes to prevention. The risk to males when 
compared with 
females would have to be inconceivably low before such differences would matter 
(Kaslow & 
Francis, 1989). 
<P> 
It is a common finding that drug treatment and education campaigns are more effective 
at 
reducing needle sharing than they are at reducing unsafe sex (Donoghoe, 1992). The 
continued 
practice of unsafe sex by injecting drug users in spite of education campaigns and 
contact with 
drug treatment programs presents a challenge for methadone maintenance programs to 
develop 
more effective ways of modifying risky sexual behaviour. This challenge is important 
not only for 
the patients in methadone treatment but also for their sexual partners and their 
children. 
<P> 
<b>HADONE MAINTENANCE AND<br> 
CONTAINMENT OF HIV</b> 
 <p> 
As is evident from the previous two chapters of this book, methadone maintenance 
treatment is 
effective in reducing illicit opioid use and therefore is also likely to be effective in 
reducing those 
behaviours associated with injecting opioid use that are involved in HIV transmission. 
This 
substantial body of evidence has to be considered as part of the case for the role of 
methadone 
maintenance treatment in HIV prevention. For the purposes of this chapter, the focus 
is on the impact of 
methadone 
maintenance on the frequency of injecting and sharing. As already stated above, 
methadone 
maintenance treatment has not as yet had any substantial effect on the levels of unsafe 
sex among 
its patients. Ways in which methadone treatment might contribute more in this regard 
are 
considered in Chapter 11. 
<P> 
<b><i>Methadone Maintenance and HIV Infection</i></b> 
<p> 
 
One indicator of the success of methadone treatment in protecting its patients from 
infection with 
HIV is whether it has protected them from infection in places where HIV has already 
spread 
rapidly among injecting drug users. As already noted, Des Jarlais et at. (1989) have 
observed that 
prevention attempts are most likely to be effective during the rapid spreading phase of 
HIV 
infection. Retrospective studies have found an association between length of time in 
methadone 
treatment and low rates of seropositivity. Patients who entered methadone treatment 
in New 
York before 1982 were found to be less likely to be HIV positive than those who had 
entered 
treatment after that year (Abdul-Quader et al., 1987). Schoenbaum et al. (1989), again 
for 
injecting drug users in New York, found that there was an inverse relation between 
total months 
of methadone treatment since January 1978 and the presence of HIV antibodies. 
<P> 
In a group of long-term, stable patients who entered treatment before the spread of 
HIV in New 
York, Novick et al. (1990) reported that none was seropositive, even though 91% had 
been 
exposed to hepatitis B, indicating that nearly all of them had shared needles at some 
time. Two 
other studies have found that patients in methadone treatment were less likely to be 
HIV positive 
than those in detoxification programs (Marmor et al., 1987) and those not yet receiving 
methadone (Chaisson et al., 1989). Similar findings suggestive of the effectiveness of 
methadone 
maintenance in preventing HIV infection among its patients have been reported for 
Italy and Sweden (see Des Jarlais, 1992a). 
<P> 
Although the studies discussed in the previous paragraph are consistent with the 
evidence for the 
overall effectiveness of methadone treatment, there are other plausible explanations for 
many of 
these findings (Ward et al., 1992). It could be the case, for example, that those patients 
who 
remain in methadone maintenance are less likely to engage in risk behaviours than 
either patients 
who leave methadone treatment early or injecting drug users who do not enter 
treatment. The 
finding of lower rates of HIV seropositivity among methadone patients would then be 
due to naturally 
occurring selection between those who enter treatment and those who do not. 
<P> 
The Swedish study (Blix & Gr6nbladh, 1988; described also by Des Jarlais, 1992b) is of 
special 
interest in this regard, because the way in which patients were accepted into 
methadone treatment 
approximated a random selection procedure. The important point to be made about 
this study is 
that nearly all the patients who entered treatment after 1983 had previously applied 
and been 
refused. Applicants for methadone maintenance were accepted or refused treatment in 
an almost 
random fashion which depended on whether there was a place available at the time of 
application 
or not. Three per cent of patients who entered methadone maintenance before 1983 
were found to 
be HIV positive, compared with 16% of those who entered treatment during the years 
1984 to 
1986 and 57% of patients who entered treatment after 1987. There had been no 
seroconversions 
of any patients who had tested negative for HIV antibodies on entry since 1984. This 
study 
provides stronger evidence in that it demonstrates that methadone maintenance 
protects its 
recipients from HIV infection and that this appears to be independent of selection bias. 
The 
following section reviews evidence that methadone maintenance treatment specifically 
affects risk 
behaviours associated with injecting. There is still, however, a need for better 
controlled 
prospective studies to confirm the findings that methadone maintenance protects its 
recipients 
from HIV infection. 
<P> 
<b><i>The Effectiveness of Methadone Treatment in<br> 
Reducing Injecting and Needle Sharing</i></b> 
 <p> 
The largest study to date of whether methadone treatment reduces injecting and needle 
sharing 
has been the Three Cities Study conducted by Ball and his colleagues, which is 
reviewed in detail 
in Chapter 3 (Ball & Ross, 1991; Ball et al., 1988). The outcomes relevant to HIV were 
the 
number of subjects that reported injecting and the number of days per month that 
they had 
injected. For sharing, the same measures were employed - the number of subjects 
sharing and the 
number of sharing days as an indicator of frequency of sharing. 
<P> 
For injecting, methadone treatment had a marked effect on both injecting and on the 
frequency of 
injecting for those who did inject. Of the 388 subjects who had remained in 
methadone 
maintenance until the end of the study period, 36% had not injected again after one 
month of 
treatment. A further 22% had not injected in the past year, and a further 13% had not 
injected for 
a period of between one and 11 months. The remaining 29% had injected in the last 
month. Overall 
71% had not injected in the month prior to being interviewed. These data are 
consistent with the 
notion that methadone treatment leads to a slow reduction in injecting and its eventual 
cessation 
for most patients while they remain in treatment. 
<P> 
Similar results were found for needle sharing - both the number of sharers and the 
frequency with 
which they shared were reduced. Those who shared during their last period of 
injecting shared 
less than those whose last period of drug use occurred before or during the admission 
phase of 
treatment. Twenty-nine of the group who had injected in the previous month (9% of 
the overall 
sample in treatment) had shared needles. 
<P> 
These results are supported by a number of other findings. Selwyn et al. (1987) found 
that being 
in methadone treatment was associated with a decrease in both needle sharing and 
injecting drug 
use. The subjects in the Abdul-Quader et al. study (1987) who had been in methadone 
treatment 
longest had the lowest levels of these risk-taking behaviours. In their Sydney study, 
Darke et al. 
(1990) found that of the 20% of their subjects in treatment (the majority of whom 
were in 
methadone treatment) reported needle sharing in the month prior to interview 
compared with 
68% of the subjects who were not in treatment. In this case it was unlikely that drug 
users in 
treatment were less likely to report such behaviour, as it was demonstrated through 
collateral 
interviews with subjects' sexual partners that patients in treatment were reasonably 
truthful about 
their risk-taking behaviour when interviewed by independent researchers (Darke et al., 
1991). 
Klee et al. (1991a) report similar findings in an English study, finding that long-term 
methadone 
maintenance was associated with a reduction in needle sharing, but only for older 
patients who 
had been long-term injecting drug users. Younger patients had the same levels of risk 
taking as 
patients out of treatment. Finally, in terms of injecting safely, Hartgers et al. (1989), in 
a Dutch 
study, found that needle exchange users tended to have had more contact with 
methadone 
maintenance programs over the previous five years than did injectors who did not 
exchange, 
suggesting that methadone maintenance programs may be effective as dissemination 
points for 
information about safe injecting practices. 
<P> 
Although all of the studies reviewed here have been observational studies without 
control groups, 
the evidence is reasonably consistent that methadone treatment is effective in reducing 
the HIV 
risk behaviours associated with injecting. This consistent finding - supported by the 
evidence 
reviewed in the previous two chapters - that methadone treatment is effective at 
reducing injecting drug 
use is difficult to ignore. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is reasonable to 
conclude that 
methadone maintenance is an important HIV prevention measure among opioid- 
dependent 
injecting drug users. 
<P> 
<b><i>Are Some Methadone Programs More Successful Than Others?</i></b> 
 <p> 
As we have observed in the previous chapters, much of the research concerned with 
the 
effectiveness of methadone treatment has focused on the issue of whether the 
treatment works at 
all. Methadone maintenance programs, however, differ from each other in 
substantially important 
ways, and very little research has looked at what types of programs are the most 
successful (Ball 
& Ross, 1991). Knowledge of this sort is important to the issue of HIV containment 
so that 
methadone maintenance programs can respond in the most effective way possible. 
Two aspects 
of treatment that are important in delivering effective treatment are dosage and the 
duration of 
methadone maintenance, both of which are dealt with in detail in Chapters 6 and 9 
respectively. 
It is worth noting briefly that two studies have looked specifically at dosage in relation 
to HIV. 
Brown et al. (1989a), in a study of 454 methadone patients in New York, found that 
low 
methadone doses were associated with being HIV positive. This held true even after 
total time 
spent in drug treatment was controlled for a variable that was also predictive of HIV 
status. In 
the Ball et al. study (Ball & Ross, 1991; Ball et al., 1988), patients on lower methadone 
doses 
were more likely to be currently injecting. These findings suggest that lower doses of 
methadone 
(<60 mg) may be less effective than higher doses in preventing HIV infection, a 
conclusion that is 
consistent with the evidence reviewed in Chapter 6. Although by themselves these two 
studies do 
not provide strong evidence for a causal relationship between methadone dose and 
HIV infection, 
taken together with the evidence in Chapter 6 they are strongly suggestive of one.

<b><i>Cocaine</i></b>

As mentioned above, methadone treatment is primarily a treatment for opioid 
dependence. The 
treatment situation for methadone maintenance programs has been complicated 
recently in the 
USA by the advent of the widespread use of cocaine, and to a lesser extent in Australia 
by the use 
of amphetamines. Methadone does not provide cross-tolerance for cocaine and would 
not be a 
recommended treatment for someone with primary cocaine dependence. Two 
studies have tried to separate the effects of methadone on injecting injecting heroin and 
injecting other drugs. Magura et al. (1989a) found that of 110 methadone patients who 
continue to inject, 
very few were injecting heroin leading them to conclude that methadone maintainance 
was effective in 
eliminating heroin use. Chaisson et al. (1989) also found an association between being 
in methadone 
treatment and a substantial reduction or cessation of heroin use. They also found 
methadone treatment 
was associated with a reduction in cocaine injection for more than half the methadone 
patients. Cocaine 
injection, however, remained a major problem for these programs. In Australia, a 
recent increase in the 
availability of amphetamines is comparable to that seen with cocaine in the USA. The 
extent to 
which amphetamine use in Australia is associated with HIV infection has yet to be 
established, 
although some research suggests that Australian amphetamine injectors were less likely 
to engage 
in risky behaviour than heroin injectors (Hall et at.,in press) . 
<P> 
<b><i>The Fate of Methadone Treatment Drop-outs</i></b> 
<p> 
 
While injecting decreases over time for most patients in methadone maintenance 
programs, leaving 
a program is associated with an increase in injecting drug use. In the Ball et al. study 
(Ball & 
Ross, 1991), the subjects who had dropped out of treatment during the year to follow- 
up 
interview were much worse off than their counterparts who remained in treatment. 
By the time of 
the interview 68% of drop-outs had relapsed to injecting drug use,.with 27% of the 
relapsers 
having shared needles. Although it could be argued that these figures are inflated 
because 
treatment drop-outs differ from other patients, this does not appear to be the case in 
the Ball et al. 
study. The patients who dropped out of treatment only differed on three of the 
characteristics 
assessed: they had received less methadone maintenance treatment overall; more were 
unemployed; and they were slightly younger than those that stayed in treatment. 
However, 
although the drop-outs did not differ in terms of the aspects of their drug dependence 
on which 
they were assessed (age of onset , length of dependence etc.), data were not provided 
that 
compared rates of injecting among the drop-out group while they were in treatment 
with those of 
the patients who remained in treatment. Murphy and Rosenbaum (1988) also claim 
that clients 
who were mandatorily withdrawn from methadone after two years because of a 
change in 
treatment policy were at greater risk for HIV infection due to relapse, but they present 
no data to 
support these conclusions. Findings like these are difficult to ignore and have 
important 
implications for treatment duration and dismissal of patients from programs. 
Uchtenhagen (1990a), for 
example, suggests that expectations about patients and the regulations of methadone 
maintenance 
programs should be relaxed in an attempt to keep patients in treatment. 
<P> 
<b><i>Low Threshold, Low Intervention and Interim Methadone Programs</i></b> 
<p> 
 
Increasing the effectiveness and the attractiveness of methadone treatment may 
necessitate 
offering different kinds of services and trying to reach a wider range of opioid users, 
and 
accordingly a number of innovative programs have been proposed and implemented 
(Uchtenhagen, 1990a). Low intervention methadone maintenance programs are those 
in which 
methadone is dispensed with minimal ancillary services. Such programs may or may 
not be 'low 
threshold', implying that there are few restrictions in terms of entry criteria. 
Dispensing low doses 
of methadone by bus in The Netherlands is another innovation (Buning et al., 1990). 
The interim 
maintenance program for people on waiting lists for methadone treatment discussed in 
Chapter 2, 
which existed for a brief time in New York, is another variant of these new post-HIV 
forms of 
methadone maintenance (Yancovitz et al., 1991). 
<P> 
These new forms of methadone treatment have a number of rationales. One is that 
making 
treatment easier to access will mean that more injecting drug users at risk will be 
treated. Another 
is that treatment might be more attractive to drug users if less therapeutic demands are 
made and 
might therefore encourage subsequent entry to more change-oriented forms of 
treatment. Such 
programs also have an economic attraction for governments. Low intervention 
methadone 
maintenance programs are a much cheaper option than the more intensive variants of 
methadone 
treatment, and a broad move to low threshold treatment would mean that more 
patients could be 
maintained on methadone for the same cost. 
<P> 
Schuster (cited in Nathan & Karan, 1989), however, has warned that a danger 
associated with 
low intervention programs is that they may be seen as a cheap alternative to traditional 
methadone 
treatment if this means compromising the quality of care being delivered. This point is 
important, 
because these new variants of methadone treatment have yet to be properly evaluated 
and, 
although there is reason to believe that they may reduce injecting drug use, there is 
little direct 
evidence at present that they are effective. 
<P> 
<b>SUMMARY</b> 
 <p> 
The advent of HIV has meant a new life threatening addition to the existing risks 
associated with 
injecting drug use. Evidence from New York and other cities throughout the world 
suggests that 
once HIV is introduced to the injecting drug using population it can spread rapidly. 
The main 
mode of transmission that initiates and maintains this spread among drug injectors is 
the sharing of 
contaminated injecting equipment. HIV is also spread sexually and perinatally, thus 
putting at risk 
the sexual partners and children of injecting drug users. There is as yet no cure for 
HIV infection, 
so the only way in which the pandemic will be stemmed will be through the 
permanent 
modification of behaviours known to be routes of transmission. 
<P> 
Some of the dynamics of needle sharing have been identified. The frequency with 
which a person 
injects, the type of drugs they use, and having a long history of injecting drug use have 
all been 
found to be significantly associated with being HIV positive. The sharing of injecting 
equipment 
is influenced by peer pressure, having family and friends who are users, the absence of 
easily 
available injecting equipment, being unable to tolerate withdrawal symptoms, injecting 
irregularly, 
being homeless, having a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, and the use of 
benzodiazepines. 
<P> 
HIV is transmitted sexually via the exchange of body fluids that occurs during 
unprotected 
penetrative sexual intercourse. This mode of transmission in combination with the 
sharing of 
injecting equipment means that the sexual partners of injecting drug users are also 
placed in a high 
risk category. Little is known about the sexual behaviour of the general population or 
the 
population of injecting drug users which makes predicting the spread of HIV difficult. 
The little 
research available suggests that drug injectors are a sexually active group and that the 
incidence of 
unsafe sex among this group is quite high. This evidence is confirmed by studies 
which have 
shown that having a sexual partner who injects is a discernible risk factor for HIV 
infection. 
 
The high incidence of STDs among injecting drug users suggests that unsafe sex is 
common 
among this group. Research to date suggests that drug users who work as prostitutes 
engage in 
safe sexual practices at work but do not do so when not working. Homosexual and 
bisexual male 
injecting drug users are at greater risk if they engage in unsafe sex due to the higher 
rates of 
infection among these groups in general. Unsafe sex among injecting drug users has 
been found to be 
associated with being younger, with using benzodiazepines, with being homeless, with 
having 
antisocial personality disorder, and with being unable to resist partner pressure about 
the use of 
condoms. As yet, methadone treatment has had little influence on the unsafe sexual 
practices of 
its patients. 
<P> 
Being in methadone treatment has been associated with lower rates of HIV infection 
for opiate 
injectors than not being in treatment in cities where the incidence of infection is quite 
high. 
Evidence also suggests that methadone treatment is effective at reducing injecting drug 
use and 
needle sharing. Successful methadone programs retain their patients in treatment, have 
higher 
maintenance dosages, have low staff turnover, and develop close, long-term 
relationships with 
their patients. Patients who drop out of methadone treatment have been found to 
have higher 
levels of HIV risk-taking behaviour than those who remain in treatment. Attracting 
HIV positive 
injecting drug users into methadone treatment is also important. Low threshold 
methadone 
programs may be a way of widening the appeal of methadone treatment, thereby 
reaching 
members of the injecting drug using population who would not otherwise consider 
treatment as an 
option.

<p> 
<b> During the 1980s criminal penalties for marijuana offenses were made much 
 tougher, at both the state and federal levels. More resources were devoted 
 to their enforcement. And punishments more severe than those administered 
 during the "reefer madness" of the 1930s became routine. As a result there 
 may be more people in prison today for violating marijuana laws than at any 
 other time in the nation's history. </b> 
 
<p> 
Mark Young is one of those prisoners. In May of 1991 young was arrested at 
 his Indianapolis home for brokering the sale of 700 pounds of marijuana 
 grown on a farm in nearby Morgan County. He had never before been charged 
 with drug trafficking. He had no history of violent crime. His two prior 
 felony convictions -- one for attempting to fill a false prescription, the 
 other for possession of a few Quaaludes and amphetamines -- were more than a 
 decade old. For each of these convictions he had received a suspended 
 sentence and a one-dollar fine. Young's role in the marijuana transaction 
 had been that of a middleman. He never handled either the marijuana or the 
 money. He had simply introduced two partners in a marijuana farm, Claude 
 Atkinson and Ernest Montgomery, to a couple of men from Florida who were 
 acting on behalf of a New York buyer. Under federal law Young was charged 
 with "conspiracy to manufacture" marijuana and was held liable for the 
 cultivation of all 12,500 marijuana plants grown on the Morgan County farm. 
 The U. S. attorney now had the option of filing for an "enhancement," owing 
 to Young's prior drug felonies; this would trigger a mandatory-minimum 
 sentence upon conviction. After being denied bail, Mark Young learned that 
 his marijuana offense could lead to a mandatory sentence of life 
 imprisonment without the chance of parole. His case helps shed light not 
 only on a quiet revolution in the realm of marijuana laws but also on the 
 often perverse consequences of mandatory-minimum sentences.

 The New Rules 
</center> </h3> 
 
 
<br> 
<p> 
THERE have been mandatory-minimum sentences in the United States since the 
 days of the first Congress, most of them adopted to punish narrowly defined 
 crimes. A number of the old mandatory minimums are still on the books, for 
 offenses such as "robbery by pirates" (1790) and "practice of pharmacy and 
 sale of poisons in China" (1915). The overwhelming majority of criminal laws 
 passed by Congress specify only a maximum sentence. It has historically 
 been the role of a federal judge to determine whether a convicted offender 
deserves that maximum, a lesser sentence, or no prison sentence at all. Until 
seven years ago a federal judge had great leeway in choosing sentences: 
Congress set only the upper limits, thereby protecting citizens from excessive 
 punishment. Parole boards served as another brake on unduly harsh 
 sentences, deciding when prisoners merited early release. 
 
<p> 
The first broadly defined mandatory minimums were contained in the 
Boggs 
 Act, which was passed at the height of the McCarthy era, amid the tensions 
 of the Korean War and domestic fears of Communist subversion. There seemed 
 to be an increase in narcotics use among the young, and lenient judges were 
 thought to be partly to blame. Members of Congress vied to appear tough on 
 drug offenders. Senator Everett Dirksen favored legislation that allowed 
 the death penalty for selling narcotics to minors. Congressman Edwin Arthur 
 Hall advocated giving drug dealers mandatory-minimum sentences of a hundred 
 years. Congressman L. Gary Clemente introduced a bill recommending the 
 death penalty for any violation of the Narcotic Drugs Import and Export 
 Act. The commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, Harry J. 
 Anslinger, seemed almost moderate in calling for a mandatory minimum of 
 five years for second offenders, which he assured Congress "would just 
 about dry up the drug traffic." Congress followed his advice and then 
 lengthened the anti-drug mandatory sentences, in 1956. One vocal critic of 
 the new sentencing regime was James V. Bennett, the director of the U.S. 
 Bureau of Prisons, who attributed the passage of such laws to "hysteria." 
 Thereafter Bennett was followed by FBI agents, who submitted reports on 
 his movements and speeches. 
 
<p> 
 By the late 1960s a widespread consensus had emerged in both 
political 
 parties that the anti-drug mandatory-minimum sentences were a failure. 
 Members of Congress, federal judges, and even prosecutors found them too 
 severe, unjust, and, worst of all, ineffective at preventing narcotics use. 
 The spread of the 1960s drug culture had hardly been impeded by the 
 existence of mandatory-minimum sentences. In 1970 Congress repealed almost 
 all the mandatory penalties for drug offenders, an act celebrated by, among 
 others, Congressman George Bush, who predicted that these "penal reforms" 
 would "result in better justice and more appropriate sentences." A 
 movement arose seeking a new means of determining federal sentences. 
 Allowing too little judicial discretion had proved to be unfair, but too 
 much could also lead to inequities: a bank robber in Florida might be given 
 twenty years by a federal judge, whereas a bank robber in California 
 received probation for exactly the same crime. Marvin Frankel, a federal 
 distinct judge in New York, imagined a system in which a commission of 
 legal experts would set guidelines on how to determine sentences for 
 various crimes, taking into account details of the offender's criminal 
 history and the nature of the offense. 
 
<p> 
After long and careful deliberation, the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 was 
 passed by Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support, creating the 
 United States Sentencing Commission. It seemed a triumph of rational 
 jurisprudence over demagoguery, an experiment in social planning that 
 evoked shades of the Progressive Era, when panels of appointed experts were 
 hailed as the ideal form of government. Judge William W. Wilkins Jr., a 
 former protege of Senator Strom Thurmond and Ronald Reagan's first 
 appointee to the federal bench, was made chairman of the new commission. In 
 only eighteen months Wilkins and his fellow commissioners devised sentences 
 of varying severity for about 2,000 different federal crimes. These 
 sentencing guidelines took effect in 1987. Under the new rules each federal 
 offense was assigned a numerical value; the judge added or subtracted 
 points in a given case, according to various criteria; and punishment was 
 determined by matching an offender's total points with a range of 
 applicable sentences listed on a chart. A judge could depart from the 
 guidelines at sentencing, but had to offer an explanation for doing so. The 
 sentence could later be appealed by the defendant -- or the prosecutor. 
 
<p> 
The same Congress that passed the Sentencing Reform Act also included in 
 that very bill mandatory-minimum sentences for drug offenses committed near 
 schools. Two years later the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 moved away from 
 the deliberate calibrations of the sentencing guidelines by endorsing the 
 blunt instrument of mandatory-minimum sentences for a wide variety of drug 
 offenders. The University of Maryland basketball star Len Bias had just 
 been killed by crack cocaine and anti-drug sentiment had reached new 
 heights; lawmakers decided once again to send a tough message. 
Mandatory-minimum sentences, based on the amount of drugs involved in an 
offense, were set at five years, ten years, and twenty years. Additional 
mandatory minimums were added later, including 
 what is now known as a "three strikes, you're out" provision that 
 specified life sentences for repeat drug offenders. During the 
 congressional debates on these mandatory sentences there was little mention 
 of the precedent of failure set by the Boggs Act, or of how the new laws 
 would undermine the sentencing guidelines, or of what the wider effects might 
be on various aspects of the criminal justice 
 system, from the initial filing of charges to the ultimate rates of 
 imprisonment. According to one survey, the most commonly cited 
 justification for the harsh new punishments was a desire for retribution, a 
 legal theory nicknamed "just desserts." 
 
<p> 
For most of the nation's first 200 years a convicted man or woman could ask 
 a federal judge for mercy. On the basis of extenuating circumstances, a 
 judge could reduce a prison sentence or waive it altogether. The new 
 mandatory-minimum laws took that power away from the judge and handed it to 
 the prosecutor. A U.S. attorney now has the sole authority to decide 
 whether a mandatory minimum applies in a particular case -- that is, 
whether to frame a charge under such a statute or not. The only way a 
defendant can be sure of avoiding a mandatory-minimum sentence is to plead 
guilty and give "substantial assistance" in the prosecution of someone else. 
The U.S. attorney, not the judge, decides whether the defendant's 
cooperation is sufficient to warrant a reduction in sentence. A defendant 
might cooperate and still not receive a shorter sentence, if the information 
supplied falls short of expectations. Long mandatory prison terms provide a 
strong incentive to talk. From the government's point of view, guilty pleas, 
accompanied by cooperation, avoid expensive trials and supply 
valuabl evidence. From the defendant's point of view, the pressure to name 
others is enormous. 
 
<p> 
Some federal judges believe that the quality of much testimony in court has 
 diminished; desperate people will say anything to save themselves. An 
 appeal for compassion is now pointless; all that matters is the demand for 
 cooperation. Under such a system the dilemmas often have an elemental 
 quality. This past January in Kansas City, Tora S. Brown -- a nineteen year 
 old first offender with an eight month old daughter -- cooperated with the 
 government's in a drug case involving PCP but refused to implicate her own 
 mother. Brown was given a ten-year prison sentence without the chance of 
 parole.

 "A Sad Day for Everybody" 
</center> </h3> 
 
 
<br> 
<p> 
ASSISTANT U.S. Attorney Donna Eide, in the Southern District of Indiana, 
 offered Mark Young a reduced sentence in return for a guilty plea and his 
 cooperation: forty years without the chance of parole. Kevin McShane, 
 Young's attorney, thought the offer ridiculous: he wouldn't accept forty 
 years as a plea bargain in a first-degree-murder case. That remained the 
 government's only offer from May to September of 1991. Meanwhile, one by 
 one, the other defendants in the conspiracy case "flipped," agreeing to 
 cooperate. 
 
<p> 
Claude Atkinson had been facing a mandatory life sentence, the others 
 sentences of ten years to life. By offering cooperation each had received a 
 "cap" on his sentence, an upper limit, of anywhere from eight to 
 thirty-five years. But each could also conceivably walk free, without any 
 prison time. Their sentences would depend on their performances in court, 
 among other things. Young and Ernest Montgomery and his wife, Cindy, were 
 the only remaining defendants who would not plead guilty. 
 
<p> 
Under the U.S. sentencing guidelines. Mark Young's marijuana offense 
 warranted a prison term of roughly twenty-two to twenty-seven years. The 
 guidelines would apply in his case unless the U.S. attorney decided to file 
 an enhancement, reflecting Young's criminal history and requiring the 
 mandatory life sentence. Donna Eide made one last offer: eighteen years, 
 pending cooperation. Young refused it. The government filed its enhancement 
 on the Friday before the trial was to begin. The wheels had been set in 
 motion, and Mark Young had a long weekend in which to make his choice: 
 agree to cooperate or risk spending the rest of his life in prison. 
 
<p> 
Kevin McShane does not believe that the government really wanted to give his 
 client a life sentence: that sort of threat is now common in the 
 give-and-take of the plea-bargaining process. He does not believe that the 
 government really wanted any information from Mark Young. Claude Atkinson, 
 who knew more than anyone else about the marijuana farm, was talking up a 
 storm. The identities of the New York and Florida buyers would have been of 
 interest to federal authorities in other districts, but it was not clear 
 that Young even knew their real names. On the eve of the trial it seemed 
 that the government simply wanted to avoid a trial. McShane strongly 
 advised Young to accept the offer of eighteen years; with so many 
 potentially hostile witnesses, his chances in court were uncertain -- a roll 
 of the dice. Young's family, which to this point had remained silent on the 
 issue, also urged him to cooperate. His mother visited him in jail and 
 begged. "At the end, when we saw how bad it was, I just really got on 
 him," she recalls. "'Please, Mark, do it, do like the rest of them are, 
 don't do this, don't end up, you know, with a life sentence, don't do it. 
 Tell whatever you have to tell. Like the rest of them are doing, to save 
 yourself.' But no way would he do it. No way." 
 
<p> 
The day before Mark Young's trial began, Cindy Montgomery agreed to a plea 
 bargain. The trial was notable for the details it revealed about the 
 marijuana-growing operation, but the outcome never seemed in doubt. McShane 
 thinks that Young's case was hurt by being tried alongside that of Ernest 
 Montgomery, who had organized the operation. Jerry Montgomery testified 
 against his brother and proved unable, owing to illiteracy, to read his own 
 plea agreement for the jury. Cindy Montgomery testified against her husband. 
 And Claude Atkinson spoke at length about everybody's criminal activities. 
 The atmosphere at the trial was enlivened by jailhouse rumors that Mark 
 Young not only had threatened the lives of Cindy Montgomery and Claude 
 Atkinson and their families but also had slept with one of the jurors, who 
 was going to thwart any guilty verdict. Young called no witnesses in his 
 own defense. There was no physical evidence linking him to the crime, only 
 testimony by Atkinson and Cindy Montgomery. The jury took just two and a 
 quarter hours to render guilty verdicts on all counts. It had not been 
 informed that a life sentence might apply. 
 
<p> 
Claude Atkinson was angry to receive a twenty-five-year sentence despite his 
 cooperation. One of the prosecutors later described Atkinson as a 
 "dreamer"; he may have expected to serve only a few years. For a 
 sixty-two-year-old man, a twenty-five-year sentence was tantamount to life 
 in prison. Ernest Montgomery, whose only previous conviction was for 
 disorderly conduct, got thirty-four years without the chance of 
 parole -- also, in effect, a life sentence. His brother received eight years, 
 his wife six, and the other defendants sentences ranging from three to ten 
 years in prison. On February 8, 1992, Judge Sarah Evens Barker gave Mark 
 Young a life sentence, as mandated. She also fined him $100, but did not 
 order any of his assets forfeited; he had none, having paid his lawyer with 
 a used car. "Mr. Young, it's a sad day for everybody in the courtroom," she 
 said. "That concludes the matter." 
 
<p> 
A few years ago a federal judge in Utah, Thomas Green, refused to give two 
 young drug offenders mandatory-minimum sentences of ten years each, ruling 
 that their due process nights had been violated by the decision to 
 prosecute them under federal law. The same charges under state law probably 
 would have brought prison terms of about two years. Congress, Judge Green 
 observed, had severely curtailed the discretion of federal judges at 
 sentencing, but had placed no similar restrictions on the behavior of 
 law-enforcement officers and U.S. attorneys. As a result, the nation now 
 faced "<i>de facto </i> sentencing by police and prosecutors." During the Bush 
 Administration, Attorney General Richard Thornburgh did try to limit the 
 freedom of federal prosecutors. He told them to seek the maximum penalty in 
 every drug case, regardless of mitigating circumstances. The so-called 
 Thornburgh Memorandum, still included in the handbooks issued to all U.S. 
 attorneys, instructs them always to pursue conviction on the most serious 
 "readily provable" charge. U.S. attorneys, however, are not obliged to 
 follow that advice. In some parts of the country they have faithfully 
 adhered to the Thornburgh Memorandum. In other parts individual exceptions 
 have been allowed when a sentence seemed particularly cruel. In a few 
 districts U.S. attorneys who oppose mandatory minimums have been 
 collaborating with sympathetic judges, finding ways to help low-level drug 
 offenders avoid long prison terms. 
 
<p> 
The Supreme Court has upheld federal mandatory minimums whenever they have 
 been challenged on constitutional grounds, consolidating the increase in 
 prosecutorial power. A U.S. attorney wields enormous influence in drug 
 cases by deciding how to frame a charge, what quantity of the drug to 
 include in the charge -- and even whether to press federal charges at all. A 
 different prosecutor might have charged Mark Young only with drug 
 trafficking, likely bringing him a sentence of about seven years. Young's 
 conviction for "conspiracy to manufacture" all 12,500 plants shows how 
 broadly that crime is now being interpreted. The owners of garden-supply 
 stores have been held legally responsible for marijuana grown by their 
 customers -- an application of conspiracy theory similar to that which once 
 imprisoned people for selling sugar to moonshiners. Often the most 
 important factor in determining a sentence is the amount of marijuana 
 involved. Mandatory minimums ignore the defendant's role in the crime: a 
 "mule" driving a truckload of marijuana can be subject to the same penalty 
 as the person financing the shipment. In fact, defendants with the smallest 
 role in conspiracies often serve the longest sentences, because they have 
 so little information to trade. According to Judge Wilkins, of the U.S. 
 Sentencing Commission, prosecutors do not pursue mandatory minimums in 
 about two thirds of the applicable cases. Their reasoning is not made 
 public. Unlike sentences administered by judges, those derived through plea 
 bargains are settled behind closed doors. 
 
<p> 
Drug offenses differ from most crimes in being subject to three 
 jurisdictions: local, state, and federal. A U.S. attorney, simply by 
 deciding to enter a particular case, may greatly skew the range of 
 potential punishments. A person may even be tried twice for the same drug 
 crime: found innocent by a state jury, marijuana growers can be -- and have 
 been -- subsequently convicted in federal court. There are no established 
 criteria for when a U.S. attorney will enter a marijuana case. The federal 
 government could prosecute any and every marijuana offender in America if 
 it so desired, but in a typical year it charges less than two percent of 
 those arrested. In some districts there is a policy that the U. S. attorney 
 will enter cases involving more than a hundred plants or a hundred pounds. 
 In others a federal prosecutor may simply take a special interest in a 
 case. Two years ago Edward Czuprynski, a liberal activist who had long 
 irritated public officials in Bay City, Michigan, was convicted in federal 
 court of possession of 1.6 grams of marijuana: the amount found in a large 
 joint. Under Michigan law he most likely would have received a $100 fine. 
 But in federal court Czuprynski was sentenced to fourteen months in prison. 
 His license to practice law was suspended. His successful law firm closed 
 down. "They busted me completely," he says, "and that's what they wanted to 
 do." After spending almost eight months in prison, Czuprynski was released 
 by order of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, a decision that the U.S. 
 attorney is now seeking to overturn. Considering his legal fees of $40,000, 
 his lost income to ten times that amount, and the untold thousands of 
 dollars the federal government has already spent on his case, Czuprynski 
 says, "That may be the most expensive joint in the nation's history." 
 
<p> 
Four 
 years ago Julie Stewart founded Families Against Mandatory Minimums, a 
 grass-roots organization with the motto, "Let the punishment fit the 
 crime." She had not given much thought to America's s drug laws until her 
 older brother was convicted for having grown 375 marijuana seedlings. His 
 sentence was five years. FAMM now has more than 90,000 members, most of 
 them politically active for the first time in their lives. After Mark 
 Young was arrested. his older sister, Andrea Strong, lost three 
 housecleaning jobs in suburban Indianapolis -- a sign of the great stigma that marijuana still 
 carries in many parts of the country. Strong is now FAMM's Midwest 
 coordinator, a self-taught expert on federal criminal law and a tireless 
 campaigner for the repeal of mandatory minimums. FAMM lobbies Congress for 
 sentencing reform and compiles case histories of inmates imprisoned under 
 mandatory-minimum laws. Among them are Michael T. Irish, a first offender 
 sentenced to twelve years in federal prison for helping to unload hashish 
 from a boat; Charles Dunlap, a first offender sentenced to eight years in 
 federal prison for renting a truck used by a friend to import marijuana; 
 and Zodenta McCarter, a sixty-six year-old woman, a first offender, poor 
 and illiterate, suffering from diabetes, described as "naive, trusting, and 
 childlike in comprehension," sentenced to eight years in federal prison for 
 conspiring to sell ditchweed (a strain of wild marijuana that is rarely 
 psychoactive). Since being incarcerated McCarter has had a heart attack, 
 been infected with tuberculosis, and endured three operations.

<p> 
LEAVENWORTH Penitentiary is the oldest prison in the federal system. It may 
 also be the most dangerous. One hundred years ago there were no federal 
 prisons. The roughly 500 convicts with federal sentences longer than a year 
 served their time in state facilities scattered across the country. In 1896 
 Congress appropriated funds for construction of the first federal 
 penitentiary, to be located on more than 1,500 acres in rural Kansas, a few 
miles from the Army base at 
 Fort Leavenworth. The new prison was built by the convicts who would soon 
 occupy it. In the eighty-eight years since it opened, only one prisoner has 
 ever escaped from Leavenworth and eluded recapture. The red-brick walls, 
 with a gun tower at each comer, are thirty-five feet high and extend an 
 equal distance beneath the ground. The main building is massive, ominous, 
 and redolent of power. It was designed to resemble the U.S. Capitol, 
converting a symbol of freedom into one of 
 punishment and obedience. On a bleak winter morning, when the grayness of' 
 the sky and that of the neighboring fields seem to merge, Leavenworth looks 
 exactly as an inmate described it more than six decades ago: like a "giant 
 mausoleum adrift in a great sea of nothingness." 
 
<p> 
To reach the visiting room, you must state your name and purpose to a 
 corrections officer in a small gun tower and then climb stairs to the front 
 entrance. After passing through two electric doors reinforced with steel 
 bars you are photographed; stamped with invisible ink; asked to sign a 
 pledge that you are not bearing firearms, explosives, or narcotics; led 
 through a metal detector; and then escorted through another large door with 
 steel bars. The visiting room looks like a Knights of Columbus meeting 
 hall, with blond-wood paneling, a row of vending machines, and comfortable 
 chairs separated by small tables. There is no glass between inmates and 
 their guests. Visits are supervised by corrections officers who sit on a 
 platform at one end of the room; surveillance cameras are hidden in the 
 ceiling. As I waited to meet Mark Young, a small boy ran up and down the 
 length of the room playing with his father, a bearded inmate in khaki work 
 clothes. 
 
<p> 
Jonathan Turley, a professor at George Washington University Law School, 
 regards Leavenworth as a perfect microcosm of the federal prison system 
 today: antiquated, often overcrowded, and extremely dangerous both for 
 inmates and for corrections officers. Leavenworth's rated capacity is about 
 1,100 prisoners, but at times in the past year it has housed more than 
 1,600. Overcrowding vastly increases the risk of violence; prison riots 
 become virtually inevitable. The federal system as a whole is operating at 
 about 40 percent above capacity. Some facilities now house two to three 
 times the number of people they were designed to hold, even as the federal 
 prison population increases at a rate of about 10,000 inmates a year. 
 
<p> 
Tough 
 federal drug laws, strictly enforced, have fueled this unprecedented growth 
 in the federal prison system. The Boggs Act of the 1950s did not have the 
 same effect, because drug offenses were less common and less vigorously 
 prosecuted. As late as 1967 the Federal Bureau of' Narcotics had only 300 
 agents. Its successor, the Drug Enforcement Administration, now has 3,400. 
 During the 1980s annual federal spending to incarcerate drug offenders rose 
 more than 1,300 percent, from $88 million to $1.3 billion. Anti-drug 
 mandatory-minimum sentences and the guideline sentences formulated to mesh 
 neatly with them have transformed the inmate population. In 1970, 16.3 
 percent of all federal prisoners were drug offenders; today the proportion 
 of federal prisoners who are drug offenders has reached 62 percent. Within 
 three years it should reach 72 percent. Many are first offenders, without 
 so much as a previous arrest, who have been imprisoned for low-level drug 
 violations. Of the 4,244 people convicted last year of violating federal 
 marijuana laws, 56 percent had no criminal record deemed relevant at 
 sentencing. State correctional facilities are also being overwhelmed by 
 drug offenders. The prison systems in forty states are now operating under 
 court order to reduce overcrowding. Violent criminals are sometimes being 
 released early to provide cell space for nonviolent drug offenders whose 
 mandatory sentences do not permit parole. The number of drug offenders 
 imprisoned in America today -- about 200,000 -- is the same as the number of 
 people imprisoned for all crimes in 1970. Since the latest war on drugs 
 began, in 1982, the nation's prison population has more than doubled. The 
 United States now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world. No 
 society in history has ever imprisoned so many of its own citizens for 
 purposes of crime control. 
 
 
<p> 
Mark Young is big -- about six foot five, with the build one would expect of 
an 
 old biker. He has long hair tied in a ponytail. He seems like a hippie 
 version of the country-and-western star Hank Williams Jr., with a gravely 
 drawl and a deadpan sense of humor. Before being sent to Leavenworth, Young 
 married his longtime girlfriend, Patricia Rowland, in a Native American 
 ceremony at the local jail. Patricia visits him as often as she can, but it 
 is a nine- or ten-hour drive from Indianapolis to Leavenworth, Kansas. She 
 brings him photographs of changes in their neighborhood: new houses, new 
 stores opening at the mall. They discuss how furniture should be rearranged 
 at their rented home; she later moves things around accordingly, and sends 
 him pictures. She does not want him to forget that a familiar world still 
 exists outside the brutal one he now inhabits. 
 
 
 
 
<p> 
Young had never been in prison before being sentenced to Leavenworth. A 
 marijuana offense usually leads to incarceration at a minimum-security 
 prison or prison camp. But Young's life sentence labels him as a high risk 
 for attempted escape, requiring that he serve his sentence at a 
 maximum-security penitentiary. Young now finds himself living among some of 
 the most violent repeat offenders in the federal system: murderers, 
 rapists, armed robbers, international terrorists. His two-man cell is eight 
 feet by ten feet, with a solid metal sliding door and no view of the 
 outdoors, just a window facing the catwalk. A few months after his arrival 
 Young sat in a prison auditorium, packed with inmates, watching <i>Silence of 
 the Lambs</i>. A riot suddenly erupted in the darkness. Prisoners divided by 
 race and tore furniture apart to make weapons. Corrections officers were 
 taken hostage. Amid the chaos Young grabbed a piece of a chair and huddled 
 against the theater wall, terrified. When officers finally quelled the riot, 
 hours later, Young was teargassed, handcuffed, and dragged alone the floor 
 through a pool of blood. Because of Young's size, other inmates have so far 
 left him alone. "But anything can happen here to anyone, at any time." he 
 told me, snapping his fingers. "Just like that." Inmates with life 
 sentences and no chance of parole have nothing to lose. Last year a good 
 friend of Young's, Clyde Harrison, was stabbed to death in the dining room, 
 before hundreds of other people, over a $50 debt. The killer politely 
 handed the knife to a corrections officer, handle first. Young had never 
 witnessed anything like it. His friend died instantly, and then "people 
 were stepping over him to get to the salad bar." 
 
 
<p> 
Young's trial was such a strange experience that he finds it difficult to 
 describe. One would have to be very stoned, he thinks, to appreciate how 
 absurd it felt. He hardly knew Ernest Montgomery and had met Claude 
 Atkinson only twice, spending a total of less than an hour with him. He had 
 never visited the farm where the marijuana was grown, and to this day does 
 not know its location. Most of the people who testified in court were 
 people whom Young had never laid eyes on before. It makes no sense to him 
 that the law should give him a life sentence for conspiring to cultivate 
 marijuana. Young is quite candid about a lot of socially unacceptable 
 things he has done, and he admits to finding a buyer for the Indiana group, 
 but he ridicules Atkinson's efforts during the trial to depict him as a 
 major broker, a Paine Webber of pot. The truth, according to Young, is much 
 less dramatic. He was in Florida, fishing with a buddy and sharing a joint. 
 His friend praised the marijuana, which Montgomery had given to Young as a 
 free sample. A few days later the friend called Young and asked if there 
 was any more of "that good stuff." Young thought there was. His friend then 
 called a friend, who called another friend: a buyer in New-York. Young 
 claims that he actually received only a fraction of the $70,000 fee alleged 
 in court. He did not really know either the buyer or the seller. Once the 
 two got together, they did the natural thing -- eliminated the middleman. "They 
 cheated me!" Young said, laughing hard. 
 
<p> 
Although he has always loved to 
 smoke marijuana, Young never thought much about it until coming to prison. 
 Now he is an authority on the subject, a fan of the authors Jack Herer and 
 Chris Conrad, who believe that growing hemp can help protect the 
 environment. The use of its fibers for paper, Young thinks, could save 
 millions of trees, and its distillation into alcohol-based fuels could end 
 the world's energy shortage. Young is busy in prison designing a Harley 
 Davidson that will run entirely on marijuana -- "the Hempster." Much to his 
 family's distress, Young was recently sent to "the Hole," Leavenworth's 
 disciplinary building, for smoking marijuana in prison. The marijuana at 
 Leavenworth is quite good, though expensive, he says. Most illegal drugs 
 are easily obtained in Leavenworth, including hashish, a rarity elsewhere 
 in the Midwest. 
 
 
<p> 
I asked Young the question that had been on my mind for weeks: Why didn't he 
 cooperate with the prosecutors, when refusing to talk seemed to guarantee a 
 life sentence? "It crossed through my mind a lot. trying to decide," he 
 said. "But there's two ways I look at it. I feel kind of proud to have 
 principles. And I'm glad I never lost that. But on the other hand, I can't 
 really brag too much, because I didn't have anybody to give them. Who was I 
 going to give them?" I suggested that they just wanted a name, some token 
 of cooperation. The only name Young could provide was that of his fishing 
 buddy; and in the end, he could not do it. "This guy has nothing," he said. 
 "This guy couldn't buy half an ounce of marijuana, okay" Young understands 
 why the other defendants behaved as they did: "When you're talking the 
 kind of time that they were passing out, you expect anybody to do what they 
 can to fend for themselves." As for him, "No, I wouldn't do it any other 
 way." 
 
<p> 
The worst thing about Leavenworth, for Young, is the noise, "the constant 
 roar of hundreds of people talking." His cell offers no escape from it, 
 from voices echoing off the steel and concrete, day and night. Should Young 
 ever be released, the first thing he plans to do is go fishing -- "I'm sure 
 now that I'm locked up, the bass have come out." He feels great bitterness 
 toward his prosecutors. "Someone who'd do what they're doing is capable of 
 doing anything.... They've only proved I'm capable of smoking a joint, or 
 of introducing a guy to another guy who needs some pounds. That's the most 
 they've proved me capable of. What they're doing, they're destroying these 
 families and passing out life sentences, taking people's lives, putting 
 children on the street -- I mean horrendous acts." He laughed. "I don't know 
 of anyone that would do anything that malicious for a salary." He has no 
 complaints about the corrections officers -- men with families, working 
toward 
 a pension, who daily walk unarmed amid scores of violent inmates. "I 
 wouldn't take their job for nothing in the world," he said. "Sometimes I 
 wonder if they realize how bad a situation they're in -- you know, really." 
 Despite it all, Young expressed a touching faith in the Constitution: 
 "We're just going through a bad period . . . but I believe the Constitution 
 can whip that." When our time was up, a prison official gave Young a 
 friendly tap on the shoulder and said, "Come on, buddy." Moments later a 
 heavy door closed, and Mark Young was gone.

</center> </h3> 
 
 
<br> 
<p> 
Tom Dawson has a folksy, small-town manner and a cluttered, unpretentious 
 office, both of which disguise the fact that he is a very successful 
 criminal attorney who has been admitted to the bar in every federal circuit. 
 Dawson grew up in the town of Leavenworth, and is arguing Young's appeal. 
 The issue before the court concerns how much marijuana Young could 
 reasonably have foreseen would be produced by the conspiracy. Dawson and 
 Assistant U.S. Attorney Donna Eide have been sparring over plants and 
 pounds and the proper equation for turning one into the other: at times 
 even the judges on the court of appeals get confused. The dispute might 
 seem worthy of an Abbott and Costello routine if its outcome were not going 
 to determine a man's fate. The gray-haired Dawson is a lifelong Republican 
 who earns a living representing drug offenders, among others. But he has 
 become profoundly disillusioned with the war on drugs. "It is corrupting 
 everything it touches," he told me. At sentencing the degree of a 
 defendant's guilt often seems less important than his willingness to hand 
 over assets and name others. "I've had watched kingpins walk free," Dawson 
 admitted. In a case handled by another lawyer, a major cocaine dealer with 
 a fleet of Leer jets testified against "everybody he ever met," Dawson 
 said, and served less than four years in prison, despite being caught with 
 20,000 kilos of cocaine. "It's just the guy who doesn't cooperate who then 
 gets everybody else's time. It's just the way it works. And they finally 
 will run into some poor guy who says, just like Mark, 'I'm not going to do 
 it. I've got principles.' Well, then, fine You take all their time. And 
 that's really about the way it works." Guilty pleas are what keep a legal 
 system that is overwhelmed with drug cases functioning. In certain 
 situations, Dawson believes, an innocent person is better off pleading 
 guilty: "If you don't plead and you bet wrong, the sentences are just too 
 high to serve." 
 
<p> 
Anti-drug mandatory-minimum sentences have created dissension in the federal 
legal system, prompting many judges to seek early retirement. Judge William 
Schwarzer, the head of the Federal Judicial Center, believes that the nation 
risks losing some of its best judges. In his view, a lack of respect for the 
profession, a sentencing process that often reduces judges to the status of 
adding machines, a staggering backlog of drug cases, and a widespread sentiment 
that judges are not to be trusted in choosing sentences may all combine to 
persuade highly qualified people to avoid the bench. Judges were meant to be 
impartial arbiters; too often now they are merely bystanders, as U.S. attorneys 
administer punishments chosen by Congress. Perhaps a hundred senior federal 
judges are currently refusing to hear low-level drug cases prosecuted under 
mandatory-minimum laws. One of them, Jack B. Weinstein, of New York's Eastern Distinct, announced his 
 decision with regret, aware that he might be passing the "dirty work" to 
 his colleagues. "I need a rest from the oppressive sense of futility that 
 these drug cases leave," He wrote in his announcement. "I simply cannot sentence 
 another impoverished person whose destruction has no discernible effect on 
 the drug trade." Weinstein believes that imprisonment can serve as a 
 deterrent; in court I watched him rebuke corrupt taxi inspectors and insist 
 that their plea bargains include prison terms. It is a question of 
 proportion. In refusing to apply a ten-year mandatory minimum to a poor 
 woman caught smuggling heroin, Weinstein quoted the utilitarian philosopher 
 Jeremy Bentham. "Every particle of real punishment that is produced, more 
 than what is necessary," Bentham wrote, "is just so much misery run to 
 waste." 
 
<p> 
Deborah Daniels was the U.S. attorney in the Southern Distinct of 
Indiana 
 from 1988 to 1993. She not only supervised Mark Young's prosecution but 
 also helped set the Justice Department's sentencing policy during the Bush 
 Administration. "My position as a prosecutor," she says, "was not to make 
 the laws." Congress had passed legislation to remove judicial discretion 
 through mandatory minimums and guidelines. The Justice Department decided 
 that it would be wrong for prosecutors "to take over that role as judges." 
 The laws were to be fully enforced as written. Daniels acknowledges that in 
 some districts assistant U.S. attorney's would "work a case backward," 
 deciding what punishment a defendant ought to receive and then finding a 
 way to charge for it. "I don't agree with that. That's cheating. And we 
 didn't cheat in the Southern District of Indiana. We played it straight. 
 And that's how Mark Young got his sentence." She denies that the threat of 
 long sentences was used mainly to induce plea bargains: "We didn't do 
 things like that." The policy of her office was to seek conviction on the 
 most serious readily provable charge -- in every case, without exception. 
"The 
 minute you start saying, Well, gee, that's kind of severe for this guy and 
 what he did," she argues, "then you're deciding what the case is worth." 
 Daniels believes that Young's sentence is what Congress mandated for that 
 offense. Many people think it is wrong to give a life sentence when "only 
 marijuana" is involved. Daniels disagrees. The United States cannot 
 discourage other countries from exporting cocaine if it is unwilling to 
 fight an illegal drug produced domestically. "Yes, prisons are expensive," 
 she admits, "but if we are going to crack down on a serious problem...we 
 are going to have to bear the brunt of that." She does not think the 
 pressure to cooperate has diminished the quality of testimony in court. And 
 what most people don't realize about U.S. attorneys, she says, is that 
 they spend a good deal of their time getting innocent people out of 
 trouble, by declining to file charges. In Mark Young's case, all things 
 considered, the system worked exactly as intended. 
 
<p> 
 Last year Attorney General Janet Reno amended the Thornburgh 
Memorandum, 
 allowing U.S. attorneys to take into account the circumstances in a 
 particular case -- a tacit acknowledgment of prosecutorial power. Seeking the 
 maximum sentence is still the policy of the Justice Department, but 
 exceptions can be made. Judith Stewart, the new U.S. attorney in Indiana's 
 Southern Distinct, has vowed to seek "consistency without mathematical 
 regimentation." The Clinton Administration, however, does not plan any 
 changes in how the war on drugs is being waged against marijuana. Lee P. 
 Brown, the head of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, 
 recently summarized the Administration's view this way: "Marijuana, as you 
 know, is a controlled substance. Our position is that it should remain a 
 controlled substance. We feel that way because it is a potentially 
 dangerous psychoactive drug, with strong links to medical problems and 
 negative, or at least high-risk, behavior among its users." Enforcement 
 policies adopted by the two previous Administrations will continue. The 
 crime bills recently passed by both houses of Congress include weak 
 "safety-valve" provisions that will allow judges to waive mandatory-minimum 
 sentences for some low-level first-time drug offenders, who in return must 
 offer full cooperation. The crime bills also specify the death penalty for 
 any marijuana offender caught with 60,000 plants or more. 
 
<p> 
 One of the great ironies of American drug policy is that anti-drug 
laws over 
 the past century have tended to become most punitive long after the use of 
 a drug has peaked. David Musto, a professor at Yale Medical School and the 
 pre-eminent historian of American narcotics policy, explains that when drug 
 use is at its height, so is tolerance; but as drugs recede from 
 middle-class homes, their users are marginalized, scapegoated, and more 
 readily punished. The price that society pays for harsh sanctions becomes 
 invisible to most people. Musto thinks that our nation's drug laws reflect 
 cultural changes after the fact; though extreme punishments may help to 
 limit a drug epidemic, the principal causes of its rise and fall lie 
 elsewhere. This theory is supported by recent history. Marijuana use among 
 the young peaked in 1979; strict federal laws were passed seven years 
 later, when use had already fallen by 43 percent; and the explanation most 
 young people gave for quitting marijuana was a concern about the perceived 
 health risks, not fear of imprisonment. A drug culture is once again 
 emerging on college campuses, despite the existence of draconian mandatory 
 minimums. Twelve years after the current war on drugs was declared, some 
 rough numbers may hint at its cost: $30 billion spent so far at the state, 
 federal, and local levels to fight marijuana; two billion dollars' worth of 
 assets seized in marijuana cases; four million Americans arrested for 
 marijuana offenses; a quarter of a million people convicted of marijuana 
 felonies and sent to prison for at least a year. Statistics can only 
 suggest a portion of the truth. As I learned from the families of inmates, 
 the human costs are not so easily measured.

 (This concludes "Marijuana and the Law".)

<a href="#treat">Treaties and Protocols</a>
<p>
On Friday morning, 15 September 1953, Mrs Alice Brownbody walked to her local pharmacy in Queanbeyan, a small NSW country town.  She purchased on prescription a bottle of cough elixir containing heroin linctus.  In purchasing and consuming heroin, Mrs Brownbody committed no offence.  She could not have been charged with possessing "trafficable" amounts of heroin.  In selling heroin to Mrs Brownbody, the pharmacist, Mr Jim Snow, also committed no offence.
<p>
In 1953, and for the previous ten years, there were no recorded deaths in Australia due to heroin overdose.  There were no centres providing detoxification for heroin users.  Property crime associated with heroin use was unknown.  No-one in Australia was in prison for trading in heroin.  According to the then Commonwealth DirectorGeneral of Health, heroin addiction and non-medical use of heroin was unheard of.  Transmission of infections through re-use of dirty needles and syringes was also unknown.
<p>
On Thursday, 2 June 1995, a young man died in Canberra of a heroin overdose less than 20 kilometres from where Mrs Brownbody had bought her legal heroin some 40 years earlier.  He was the ninth person to die from a heroin overdose in the ACT in four months.  In purchasing and consuming heroin, this young man committed a number of offences - for which some in society would brand him a criminal.  His possession of "trafficable" amounts of heroin was a criminal offence.  The unknown person who sold him the heroin had also committed a number of (more serious) offences.
<p>
In the last decade of the twentieth century, over 450 Australians die each year from heroin overdose.  There are not enough detoxification centres and methadone maintenance programs to meet demand.  Property crime associated with heroin use, or the securing of its supply, costs Australia an estimated $400 million a year.  Over half the prisoners in Australia are serving time for drug-related crimes.  Actual or threatened transmission of blood-borne viruses (such as HIV and hepatitis B and C) from shared needles and syringes is considered a critical public health issue.
<p>
In the four decades since heroin was banned in Australia in 1953, the pharmacological properties of the drug have not changed.  Its "addictive" potential has not altered.  Social controls over this and all other illicit drugs and the way they are supplied have, of course, changed dramatically and at great cost to our community.  When Mrs Brownbody lawfully bought her heroin syrup from a pharmacy in Queanbeyan, Robert Gordon Menzies was Prime Minister, and Jim Snow, the pharmacist, often dispensed legal heroin to patients considered to be addicted to it.  After heroin was prohibited, he saw his patients change from ordinary folk to people who lied, stole, deceived and prostituted to get what they had previously obtained legally and without difficulty.
<p>
In this chapter we examine how Australia and other countries changed their controls over illicit drugs.  Why we changed our social controls is a much more complicated question.  Substances which act on the brain to change our mood, such as opium and marijuana, have been used since the beginning of recorded history. The opium poppy is mentioned in ancient writings from central Asia before 6000 BC.  Assyrian medical remedies relied heavily on opium as far back as 900-700 BC.  Hippocrates documented the properties of the juice of the opium poppy.  Opium cultivation spread to India (400-500 AD) and China (600 AD) and arrived in Britain during the tenth and eleventh centuries.  For over 800 years, there was no formal control of opium or opium-based products in Britain.
<p>
The earliest recorded use of cannabis was in Taiwan 10,000 years ago.  Indian sources refer to marijuana in 2700 BC; the Assyrians refer to it in 650 BC and it was found in German relics from 500 BC.  Marijuana remained freely available in most western countries until the 1930s, when various countries banned distribution and consumption.  Australia banned cannabis in 1926 following an international meeting in 1925.  New South Wales banned cannabis in 1927, although records show that authorities could not see any particular reason to ban the drug - nobody was using it.  But as the Commonwealth had already banned the drug, New South Wales decided to follow Canberra"s example.  In the United States in the 1930s, cannabis was legally available as a medicine, but alcohol production or sale was prohibited.  A decade later, alcohol was legal but cannabis was illegal.  History teaches us that the decision to ban a particular drug is often arbitrary.  Once written into law, even capricious decisions take on a new meaning. Criticism of drug policy is often interpreted as an attack on the foundation of the state.
<p>
Public drunkenness was considered a social or criminal offence for over 380 years.  Most Australian States only decriminalised public drunkenness in the 1970s.  Prohibition drug laws of the modern era date back to the first opium control legislation about a century ago.  Prohibition of marijuana Australia is less than 70 years old.  In 4000 years of documented historical drug usage, public drunkenness laws have existed for less than ten per cent of that time while criminal penalties for other drugs have been around for less than three per cent.
<p>
The history of drug prohibition in Australia and elsewhere is shrouded in ignorance, bigotry, racial prejudice and false assumptions.  These conditions helped to create prohibition in the early twentieth century.  But we were also willingly subservient to more aggressive players on the international stage, committed to establishing global control of narcotics.
<p>
Australia"s drug policy and legalisation did not follow from a comprehensive "root and branch" review.  They developed by slow accretion.  Commonwealth and State legislatures displayed a willingness to establish drug control policies in response to overwhelming pressure.  For example, the Commonwealth was under considerable international pressure in the 1950s because Australia consumed relatively large quantities of heroin per head of population.  This resulted in the total prohibition of heroin in 1953.  The rather hurried copying of legislation in the States occurred without questioning whether or not it was good for Australia.  There was little investigation of the ramifications of these new policies.  Consistently, Australian drug policies have been reactive responses rather than products of political vision, leadership or sound scientific scholarship.
<p>
Opium smoking had been relatively common among Chinese immigrants in Australia for several decades when the colonies began to regulate opium consumption in the 1890s.  Drug legislation at that time was mainly a response to pressure from the public for protection against the misuse of poisons.  Racial bias against the Chinese, coupled with the moral concerns of the influential temperance movement (associated with a middle-class women"s lobby), led to Australia"s early "Chinese opium laws".  Evidence which did not support prohibition was never considered.  Such evidence would not have mattered because the case against opium was based on moral arguments, often with a strong religious basis, rather than scientific facts.
<p>
During the 1890s and the first decade of the twentieth century, recreational use of opium became legally stigmatised.  Controls came through prohibition rather than regulation.  The argument then advanced, and one that still has some emotive force today, was that once something evil was banned, the problem was solved. No alternative ways of controlling opium smoking were ever considered.  Between 1895 and 1908, all Australian States and the Commonwealth passed opium control laws.  These laws did not deal with opium contained in the secret remedies of patent medicines, nor with its common and frequently habitual consumption in the form of laudanum (which was swallowed).  Only opium in form suitable for smoking, used almost exclusively by the Chinese was outlawed.  This limited and quite specific aim was achieved by legislation that was both a radical contrast to the poison law which came before it, and a clear precedent for the more general drug laws which followed.
<p>
Opium smoking in Australia was hated as a symbol of the Chinese.  It was seen as an agent of vice, lethargy and filth and the tool by which "innocent white girls" were seduced by "lustful and unscrupulous Chinamen."  The link between opium smokers and depravity coloured the imagination of Austratia"s European settlers almost from the beginning.  By the late 1880s, opium and the "Chinese vice"was considered to have become a scourge.  A petition presented to the NSW Parliament in 1887 claimed that European women, after being induced to use opium dens, became habitues of the same resorts and scenes of the grossest immorality ensued.
<p>
The first Australian laws controlling opium, which prohibited opium smoking, were passed in South Australia in 1895, when the only people smoking opium were Chinese.  In 1905, the Commonwealth stopped the legal importation of opium which had previously attracted a duty.  Within three years, the official charged with reporting on customs to the new Australian Parliament concluded that the government had lost (60,000 per year income, even though opium was entering the country just as before.  Racial hatred lay behind the origin of our drug laws, as was also the case in other countries such as the United States.  Opiates as a linctus, the form preferred by Europeans, continued to be available in Australia until the mid-1950s.
<p>
Later laws restricting the use of heroin, morphine and cocaine were built upon the precedent of the opium control laws.  These national laws, and the ever-increasing international regulations and controls, developed through the 1920s and 1930s, step by step, always tightened and never relaxed.  Not developed through any conscious determination to create a comprehensive system of control over an ever-expanding range of drugs; not as the result of careful scientific study; not because of erudite scholarship.  But as a response to international and bureaucratic pressure.  There has never been an open and full scientific assessment of any of the identified "problems" associated with illicit drug use to justify or vindicate any Commonwealth or State prohibitionist laws.  The epidemic of Royal Commissions, parliamentary and other official inquiries which began in the 1970s have in recent years increasingly questioned the philosophical basis and effectiveness of our reliance on law enforcement to control illicit drug problems.  But fear of political retribution has always prevented our politicians from fashioning our laws from the conclusions of our expensive opium smoking in Australia was hated as a symbol of the Chinese.  It was seen as an agent of vice, lethargy and filth and the tool by which 'innocent white girls' were seduced by 'lustful and unscrupulous Chinamen'.  The link between opium smokers and depravity coloured the imagination of Austratia's European settlers almost from the beginning.  By the late 1880s, opium and the 'Chinese vice' was considered to have become a scourge.  A petition presented to the NSW Parliament in 1887 claimed that European women, after being induced to use opium dens, became habitu6s of the same resorts and scenes of the grossest immorality ensued.and increasingly frequent Royal Commissions.
<p>
When a total ban on the use of heroin for any purpose, including medical reasons, was mooted in Australia in 1950, no State government supported the proposal.  Opposition was considerable.  In 1952, the NSW Government opposed the Commonwealth proposal, arguing that heroin was quite effectively controlled in their State and that there was no justification for total prohibition.  The Federal Council of the British Medical Association (BMA) in Australia, the forerunner of the AMA, also argued strongly that there should be no curtailment of the availability of heroin.  The attitude of the BMA did not seem surprising as heroin was already controlled exclusively by the medical profession.  The BMA feared that the proposed prohibition of heroin would deprive them of a useful drug frequently prescribed for the pain of childbirth and the often intractable pain of terminal cancer.  The Commonwealth"s senior health bureaucrat, the Director-General of Health, argued at the time that although heroin was frequently used in Australia as a prescribed drug and in many cough mixtures, both addiction to it and the non-medical use of it were almost unheard of.
<p>
Nonetheless, in international forums the Commonwealth was made acutely aware of the political embarrassment caused by Australia"s relatively high level of heroin consumption.  Following minimal consultation with the States and the medical profession, the Commonwealth acted by prohibiting all importation and manufacture of heroin in June 1953.
<p>
The Commonwealth sought to justify the ban to the public on the ground of its being a health measure necessary to control and counter the perils of heroin addiction.  Yet no-one had ever suggested, and the Commonwealth Government consistently denied, that Australia"s level of heroin consumption was a function of its legal use, or was an unquestionable result of consumption by addicts.
<p>
No study was commissioned to assess the prevalence of heroin addiction in Australia prior to the ban being imposed.  Nor was any study commissioned to assess the addictive potential of heroin.  In other words, this decision was not made rationally.  The decision had no scientific basis and was contrary to advice given by experts including the medical and pharmaceutical professions.  It was, apparently, a political decision taken to appease international detractors and to accede to the "draconian" prohibitionist policies championed by the United States.  Like the development of drug policy in general it reflected, first, an obedience to international opinion, and second, a growing acceptance of stereotypes about evil or helpless addicts.
<p>
eviThus, the domestic origins of our drug policy lie with a nineteenth century moralistic and racial social ethic, bolstered by international opinion fostered by the United States.
<p>
The large number of our international treaties commits Australia to a prohibitionist "crime and punishment" approach.  Two main effects flow from this international pressure.  First, drug laws enacted throughout Australia have conformed to the international prohibition model, which has required relentless extension and intensification.  For example, the 1905 Commonwealth proclamation, which dealt only with opium, was expanded in 1914 to deal with a range of other drugs covered by the Opium Convention of 1912 (sponsored by the United States).  Following Commonwealth insistence, State legislation likewise expanded beyond opium smoking to deal with the other drugs in accordance with Australia"s international treaty obligations.
<p>
Second, the international treaties entrenched the assumption that the way illicit drug use was being controlled in this country was effective and inevitable.  Strict prohibitions and severe penalties, including the punishment for possession, came to be seen as beyond questioning.
<p>
<a href="#how">Top</a>
<p>
<a name="treat"></a>
<b>Treaties Treaties and protocols</b>
<p>
The first International Convention on narcotics, sponsored by the United States and signed in the Hague in 1912, covered opium, morphine and cocaine.  Australia signed the Convention in 1913, becoming committed to the gradual suppression of the non-medical use of specified drugs.  Signatory countries were required to pass laws to limit the manufacture, sale and use of drugs to medical and research purposes.  Illegal possession was to be considered a penal offence.  Consequently, by 1914, the Commonwealth Government had prohibited the importation of medicinal opium, morphine, cocaine and heroin, unless covered by a licence.  By the mid 1920s, all the States had enacted legislation supporting the Commonwealth laws and Australia"s international obligations.
<p>
The 1925 International Opium Convention (the 1925 Geneva Convention) set out to coordinate international action taken against illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs.  The signatories to the Convention agreed to use this new Convention to control the distribution of various narcotic drugs, including cannabis (at the request of Egypt, Turkey and South Africa).  Egypt argued that as more Egyptian men than women suffered mental illness and more men than women also used cannabis, therefore cannabis must cause mental illness.  Such were the shaky foundations upon which the edifice of prohibition was built.  Once built, we could not admit the possibility that it was all a dreadful and costly mistake.
<p>
The primary aim of the 1931 International Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs was to restrict worldwide manufacture of drugs entirely to medical and scientific needs.  The Convention also established a system of estimating medical and scientific requirements for the drugs which has been continued in later treaties and which was to be binding on all signatories.
<p>
One of the key provisions of the 1936 Convention for the Suppression of the Illicit Traffic in Dangerous Drugs required the parties to severely punish, particularly by imprisonment, the offences of illicit narcotic trafficking if such offences were committed internationally.  This Convention also set the pattern for subsequent Conventions by establishing an atmosphere in which illicit drugs were to be stereotyped as "bad", "evil" and "immoral".  The consequence of this was that treaties, and the complementary domestic legislation they required, were increasingly directed at all the activities associated with drug taking.  This was also the first Convention which aimed, though in an indirect manner, to subordinate the domestic laws of signatories to international controls.
<p>
After the Second World War, the Commonwealth Government, in effect, surrendered its constitutional responsibility to make its own laws covering illicit drug control.  The 1948 Paris Protocol required signatories (including Australia) to place on any new drug the same controls which applied to heroin, morphine and cocaine simply upon notification by the World Health Organisation that the appropriate regime laid down in the 1931 Convention should be applied.  Thus any decision, policy or legislation, whether or not to treat new or uncontrolled drugs as dangerous drugs, was no longer up to Australian governments at all.  They were and still are obliged to accept without questioning the decisions of the World Health Organisation.
<p>
The New York Opium Protocol of 1953 limited the use and international trade of opium to medical and scientific needs.  Only seven countries were authorised to produce opium for export.  Also, the Permanent Central Opium Board (PCOB) was given authority to impose a mandatory embargo on import or export of opium from or to a country which failed to carry out obligations under the Protocol.  The national sovereignty of Australia in this area was made subordinate to PCOB bureaucrats.  The next logical step in the process of international prohibition was in the late 1950s.  Previous treaties, conventions and agreements relevant to drugs were consolidated, forming the basis of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.
<p>
This Convention codified most of the previous relevant treaties and extended international control to the cultivation of certain plants including cannabis.  It was also important for another reason.  For the first time, a Convention shifted from proclaiming to signatory States that certain activities should be prohibited, to declaring that only certain activities were allowed.  In the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, international controls were extended to synthetic hallucinogens, stimulants and sedatives.
<p>
The 1961 Single Convention was amended by a 1972 Protocol which strengthened its provisions relating to the prevention of illicit production, traffic and use of narcotics.  But it also provided for the first time, for the treatment, education, rehabilitation and social reintegration of "abusers" as alternatives, or in addition, to incarceration.
<p>
The most recent development was the UN Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988.  This Convention restates the particular prohibitions of earlier Conventions, adds several new offences with emphasis on heavy sanctions, and outlines the process of sentencing to be followed by the courts under domestic laws.
<p>
Our drug laws are a complex web of international treaties and domestic laws.  Reform cannot occur without consideration of this web.  In Australia, reform must also confront overlapping Commonwealth and State responsibilities and legislation.  These complexities may complicate and delay change.  But they wilt not be able to prevent a reform that increasingly seems inevitable.

<p>
Pharmacy ledgers from 1897 to 1914 in Deeside, Scotland, recently came to light, 
recording the regular supply of medicinal cocaine, heroin and other narcotics to members 
of the Royal Family attending Balmoral to shoot grouse.  The Princess Royal received 
cocaine solution and ointment; Winston Churchill MP was sold cocaine hydrochloric.  As 
<i>The Guardian Weekly</i> (September 1993) observed, "before the supply of drugs 
was restricted by a series of laws beginning in 1908, it was a common practice to sell 
drugs on a scale that would now invite lengthy prison sentences."
<p>
So far, we have considered why Australia and the international community decided to ban 
certain drugs.  In this chapter we review, step by step, the evidence which shows that 
prohibition has failed.  To be regarded as successful, prohibition should reduce the 
cultivation, production, transport, distribution, sale and consumption of illicit drugs, stem 
the flow of drug profits and decrease the harms resulting from their consumption.
<p>
<a href="#has">Top</a>
<p>
<a name="cult"></a>
<b>Has prohibition reduced cultivation<br>
of opium, coca and cannabis.?</b>
<p>
Between 1985 and 1993, global opium production increased almost threefold and 
production of coca leaf nearly doubled.  See the figure below.
<p>
These figures suggest that prohibition has failed dismally to limit the production of 
heroin and cocaine.
<p>
The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Washington DC, convened a 
meeting of experts in 1993. The participants noted that opium cultivation has now spread 
to Guatemala and Colombia, with Guatemala alone already processing enough to satisfy 
the yearly needs of 1.5 million heroin users.  Opium poppy is now also cultivated in 
Poland, Ukraine, Moldova, the Caucasus and central Asia.  An estimated 5000 acres of 
opium poppy are now under cultivation in five central Asian republics.  In January 1992, 
the Prime Minister of Kazakhstan announced the reinstatement of legal opium poppy 
cultivation.  Nearby Kyrgyzstan considered publicly legalising opium poppy cultivation 
but subsequently decided against.  Opium poppies have now been located by law 
enforcement authorities in at least 13 of China's 23 provinces and five autonomous 
regions.
<p>
Global opium production is estimated now at about 3600 tonnes annually.  
Approximately ten tonnes of opium is required to produce one tonne of heroin.  Global 
heroin production is therefore now about 360 tonnes.
<p>
Illicit coca cultivation, once confined to one region in Peru, is now spreading to other 
provinces, while new coca cultivation is reported in Brazil, Ecuador and Venezuela.
<p>
Farmers planting opium and coca each season are believed to factor in a loss of about five 
per cent due to eradication, and accordingly cultivate a little more than they would expect 
to sell.  In 1992, the estimated total land area utilised for worldwide cultivation of opium, 
coca and marijuana was 463,613 hectares or 4636 square kilometres.  This is almost twice 
the area of the ACT, which occupies 243,200 hectares or 2432 square kilometres.  Global 
cultivation of illicit drugs is clearly not hampered by lack of suitable farming land.
<p>
The International Narcotics Control Strategy Reports produced by the US State 
Department maintain a cautiously optimstic tone, urging the international community to 
grit its teeth for the long haul.  Inevitably, victory is around the next corner.  The 1992 
Report comfortingly notes that "if there appears to be a loss for every gain in the drug 
war, it is largely because an annual review looks at progress in a relatively narrow slice of 
time and tends to obscure long-term progress", while conceding that there is "some 
inevitable bad news".  Yet "despite some setbacks, the international anti-drug effort 
gained further strength, forcing a highly adaptable international drug trade to shift tactics 
and operations" (BINM, INCSR 1992).  Some setbacks, some further strengths!
<p>
The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) in Vienna also issues annual reports 
summarising global progress to counteract narcotics.  The Board noted in 1993 that "the 
world has witnessed the 'globalisation' of the drug abuse problem and the situation has 
worsened drastically".  The Board admitted that "some decades ago the abuse problem 
was the concern of only a limited number of countries, but today countries that are not 
suffering from harmful consequence of drug abuse are the exception rather than the rule. 
Furthermore, "the economic power and political influence of drug cartels are rising" 
(INCB 1993).  But there were some crumbs of comfort.  More governments were, the 
Board claimed, beginning to realise that international cooperation in drug control was a 
matter of urgent self-defence.  It considered that a 1988 United Nations Convention 
against illicit drug trafficking created a global mechanism against international drug-
related criminal activities by extending the scope of the international drug control treaties 
to concrete provisions against the activities of criminal organisations. A common feature 
of these reports is expressions of anguish about the deteriorating global illicit drug 
situation, while providing enough evidence of progress to ensure continuing support from 
generous donor countries.
<p>
But the substance of the Reports conveys a growing recognition of the failure of 
international drug control efforts.  The 1993 INCB Report noted that distinctions 
previously made between supplier and consumer countries "no longer have any meaning: 
consumer countries have become supplier countries and visa versa".  Likewise "transit 
countries" have quickly become consumer countries and may also become supplier 
countries.  It notes that "the simplistic view that suppressing illicit drug production in 
some 'supplier countries' and/or reducing illicit drug demand in 'consumer countries' will 
automatically lead to the solution of the drug problem is no longer valid, if indeed it ever 
was".  If prohibition has reduced cultivation of illicit drugs, the International Narcotics 
Control Strategy Report and the International Narcotics Control Board neglect to provide 
evidence of that success.
<p>
In the first five years of the 1990s, opium production has spread alarmingly to countries 
where it has never been previously noted. Opium cultivation was reported for the first 
time in South America - Colombia in 1990 and later in Peru.  Opium cultivation has also 
returned to China in the last decade.
<p>
The Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence 1994 Annual Report provides little to be 
cheerful about, as Commissioner Johnson acknowledged.  Cannabis provides the best 
evidence that Australia's efforts to restrict illicit plant cultivation have been successful.  
However, demand continues at high levels and alternative supply routes have opened up 
from South East Asia, the Middle East and Papua New Guinea.
<p>
Our most successful attempt at prohibiting the cultivation of an illegal plant may have 
had an undesirable result.  The domestic cannabis industry has been replaced by another 
domestic industry which produces amphetamines - a more toxic drug which is also 
injectable.  Authorities are now trying to control domestic amphetamine production by 
restricting supplies of pre-cursor chemicals. On past performance there are two likely 
outcomes: the new controls will be subverted or more amphetamines will be imported.
<p>
Prohibition functions in a similar manner to tariffs.  When the United States successfully 
managed to restrict importation of cannabis from Mexico, a vigorous domestic industry 
rapidly developed in California.  Suppression of Australian domestic cannabis production 
has been good news for overseas cannabis traffickers. In the long run, this "success" may 
be bad news for Australia's primary producers.  Cannabis imported from New Guinea, 
Thailand or Lebanon does not pass through quarantine control and could, therefore, 
contain organisms which could easily damage the Australian food plant and livestock 
industries.
<p>
The effect of prohibition on drug cultivation and production has been likened to 
squeezing a balloon.  Authorities are sometimes able to demonstrate success in one area.  
Soon another growing area or cartel takes over.  There is always someone sufficiently 
desperate or ruthless.

<b>Has prohibition reduced production of illicit drugs?</b>
<p>
Accurate data are unavailable and never will be available for an entirely illegal activity.  
But in less than a decade, a domestic amphetamine production industry has become 
established in Australia.  Amphetamines are now readily available, inexpensive and 
widely consumed.  It has been suggested that the restriction of cannabis has stimulated 
spectacular growth of an amphetamine industry.
<p>
This illustrates a common problem with prohibition: more toxic drugs drive out safer 
drugs.  The principle is fairly simple. Restricting established illicit drugs often results in 
new, more concentrated drugs becoming available.  These are less readily detected but, 
being more concentrated, there is a smaller margin of error for overdose and a greater 
likelihood of toxicity.  Amphetamines are clearly more toxic than cannabis.  Also, 
cannabis cannot be injected, unlike amphetamines.  Any drug which can be injected can 
become a vehicle for spreading viral infections including HIV, and hepatitis B and C. 
Injectable drugs are more likely to be complicated by overdose.
<p>
The participants in the CSIS meeting (1993) noted the explosion of worldwide production 
of illicit drugs and concluded from US Government estimates that cocaine production in 
Latin America increased seven per cent between 1990 and 1991, worldwide opium 
production increased 33 per cent between 1988 and 1991, while hashish production for 
the four major producing countries grew 65 per cent between 1990 and 1991.  Cocaine 
refining, once restricted to Colombia, has now spread to Peru, Bolivia, Venezuela, 
Argentina, Ecuador and Brazil.  Since 1991, cocaine processing laboratories have also 
been found in Portugal, Spain and Italy.

<a name="trans"></a>
<b>Has prohibition reduced transport of illicit drugs?</b>
<p>
Authorities estimate that generally only five to ten per cent of illicit drugs are 
successfully interdicted en route.  There are no data to suggest that we are more 
successful than other countries. When authorities seized 14 tons of cocaine in the Los 
Angeles area in the early 1990s, orice and purity were back to normal within four months, 
suggesting that ample stocks were around but needed a bit of reorganising.
<p>
Former Cabinet Minister Susan Ryan took part in a review of the Australian Customs 
service which included consideration of their anti-drug operations.  She later spoke 
frankly on television about the ineffectiveness of customs detection of illici drugs 
entering Australia (Lateline ABCTV 7-4-1994). As with production of illicit drugs, 
traffickers expect that a small percentage of transported drugs will be intercepted.  They 
are believed to factor this into their planning by transporting a little more than they expect 
to sell.  Drugs intercepted at this stage are still at wholesale prices and are relatively easy 
to replace. Successful interception of drugs transported between producer and consumer 
countries has minimal effect on street prices.
<p>
The balloon effect also operates with transport. When the going gets tough, traffickers 
smuggle drugs in containers of frozen and perishable foods.  If customs want their dogs to 
smell the contents of a container, then the entire contents must be thawed (and spoilt).  
This increases the cost and inconvenience of customs operations considerably.  When 
most of the drugs transported through Amsterdam were intercepted, traffickers sent them 
through Nigeria.  When that pattern was recognised, new transit ports and mechanisms 
were developed.
<p>
Operation Just Cause, involving 24,000 US troops in an invasion of Panama in December 
1989, successfully seized, tried and convicted General Manuel Noriega on drug-related 
charges.  Much of the evidence against the former head of state came from major drug 
traffickers provided with a reduced sentence if they agreed to testify.  The invasion cost 
the lives of over 600 Panamanians, 200 invading soldiers and also cost Panama hundreds 
of millions of dollars.  Yet there is no evidence that even this invasion made the slightest 
difference to the transport of cocaine or the movement of drug profits.

<a name="sale"></a>
<b>Has prohibition reduced sales of illicit drugs?</b>
<p>
A simple piece of arithmetic demonstrates how difficult it will ever be to reduce sales of 
illicit drugs.  The price of a kilogram of heroin on entry to Australia is around $20,000.  
This may finally retail at $300,000 per kilogram (at a street price of $300 per gram).  If 
ten percent of a "wholesale" kilogram is intercepted before finally reaching the consumer, 
the industry only needs to raise retail prices by one to two percent to cover these 
additional "costs of distribution".
<p>
There is little evidence that prohibition has much long-term effect on wholesale and retail 
sales of illicit drugs.  Arrested dealers are replaced the same day.  Arrested users are also 
easy to replace.  Some authorities believe that increasing the inconvenience for "would 
be" consumers of illicit drugs may have a significant effect on sales.  But there is little 
evidence that prohibition has a significant long-term effect on sales.  Prohibition is 
effective in shifting drug selling from wealthier, more influential neighbourhoods to 
poorer neighbourhoods.

<a name="sump"></a>
<b>Has prohibition reduced consumption of illicit drugs?</b>
<p>
As prohibition has been steadily intensified worldwide over the last quarter century, 
consumption of illicit drugs has spread to more and more countries.  There are now 
estimated to be more than five million drug injectors worldwide in about 120 countries.  
This can hardly be deemed a success.
<p>
The 1994 Annual Report of the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence (ABCI) 
reported that:

<blockquote>
Heroin is widely available in all jurisdictions at high purity levels, and stable prices 
indicate that sufficient quantities are being supplied to the market.  Suppliers are 
apparently successfully adjusting the volume of heroin being supplied to compensate for 
seizures by Australian authorities...
<p>
All LEA (Law Enforcement Authorities) intelligence sources report that both the harder 
illicit drugs and cannabis were generally readily available throughout 1994.  Occasional 
price fluctuations and temporary shortages may indicate either a disruption in the supply, 
or an increase in demand, for specific drugs...
<p>
Large cannabis crop seizures across Australia in recent years may have had a temporary 
impact on the availability (and hence price) in some areas; however, long-term changes in 
the market are not evident, indicating that alternative sources become available.
</blockquote>
<p>
Referring to heroin, the Report notes that "purity levels are consistently higher across 
most jurisdictions".  It adds that "supply is regular and consistent, although some 
variations in price and purity do occur".
<p>
The Report reaches the reasonable conclusion that:<br>
<blockquote>
The proportion who have tried illicit drugs other than cannabis, and their frequency of use 
of such drugs, has remained stable over the past ten years (albeit with minor fluctuations).  
These patterns of use are predicted to remain similar in the near future.  Continuing 
availability and growing acceptance of cannabis use by the wider community is 
anticipated with an expectation that the "decriminalisation debate" associated with its use 
will become more pronounced ...
<p>
Initiatives by both health and education authorities, although individually successful, 
have not substantially reduced illicit drug demand in Australia, but may have contributed 
to its stability via a dampening effect.  The demand for cannabis, and its widespread use, 
may increase with the maturation of young adults who are now its heaviest users and with 
whom it has gained the most acceptance.
</blockquote>
<p>
This remarkably honest assessment by the ABCI provides little encouragement to those 
who consider that prohibition has reduced the availability of illicit drugs in Australia.  In 
the United States, the number of people who consume cocaine has decreased but the 
quantity consumed by those who use cocaine has increased, so that the total quantity 
consumed is about the same. Is this a victory for prohibition?

<b>Has prohibition reduced drug-related crime?</b>
<p>
Former US Surgeon General, Dr Joycelyn Elders, remarked at a press conference that the 
US should study legalisation.  This simple comment provoked considerable controversy 
across the United States.  Some months later, her son was sentenced to ten years in gaol 
on a charge of selling a small quantity of cocaine.  When a journalist asked Dr Elders as 
she emerged from the courthouse whether she thought her son would commit the same 
crime again after he was released from prison, Dr Elders replied movingly that she did 
not think her son had committed a crime in the first place.  Many of the people caught up 
in so-called drug crimes are just ordinary citizens who use drugs from time to time.
<p>
The 1994 ABCI Annual Report notes that the recorded drug offence rate in Australia has 
increased from 150 per 100,000 population in 1980, to 500 in 1992.  The rate increased 
exponentially in the first half of the 1980s, fluctuated over the next five years and then 
started to increase again in the early 1990s.  This cannot be considered a success.  Some 
authorities even suggest that the major effect of law enforcement on drug trafficking is to 
select survivors who are more ruthless, more violent and more cunning.
<p>
Drug offences in Australia increased more than threefold in a little over a decade.  During 
this time, prohibition has been progressively strengthened.  Property crime has also 
increased during this period but this could be due to multiple other factors.  Strengthening 
prohibition by increasing penalties or police resources can actually increase property 
crime, as the ABCI (1994) noted:<br>
<blockquote>
Successful initiatives aimed at reducing the availability of drugs may in fact increase 
property crimes.  In assessing the relationship between heroin and violence, the National 
Committee on Violence, in 1990, concluded "almost all the violence associated with 
heroin may be attributed to policies relating to its control, rather than to any inherent 
pharmacological properties".  Some criminologists consider that law enforcement success 
in limiting drug availability on the streets can have the undesirable effect of actually 
increasing levels of drug-related crime: "Those who would normally earn sufficient 
income from trafficking in the drug to support their own drug habit find an alternative 
source of income, such as breaking and entering or bag snatching, in order to be able to 
buy drugs from others. Other research has shown that by targeting heroin users, rather 
than distributors, more beneficial results were obtained from a community point of view, 
although possibly only on a local level and probably only in the short term." This section 
of the Report concluded that: ... while there is still some debate over the level of 
connection between drugs and crime, it is, nevertheless, clear that both Federal and State 
policies on drugs have the potential to significantly affect the level of drug-related crime.
</blockquote>
<p>
By 1993, at least 50 of the 680 senior Federal judges in the United States decided to 
withdraw from drug cases. Judge Whitman Knapp, former head of a famous commission 
of inquiry into police corruption in New York City (which was the basis of the film 
Serpico), said "people think they can stop the drug traffic by putting people in gaol and 
by having terribly long sentences. But, of course, it does not do any good" (The New 
York Times 26-3-1993). Judge Jack Weinstein, another senior US Federal judge who had 
taken the same action, added "the penalties have been increased enormously without 
having any impact. It is just a futile endeavour, a waste of taxpayers' money" (The New 
York Times 26-3-1993).
<p>
Mr Raymond Kendall, Secretary-General of Interpol, was interviewed in early 1994 by 
the French magazine <i>Le Nouvel Observateur</i>. He said that "western governments 
... would lose the war against dealers unless efforts were switched to prevention and 
therapy," adding that "all penalties for drug users should be dropped ... Making drug 
abuse a crime is useless and even dangerous ... Every year we seize more and more drugs 
and arrest more and more dealers but at the same time the quantity available in our 
countries still increases." Mr Kendall said "police were losing the drug battle worldwide" 
(as reported in <i>The Age</i> 1 January 1994).
<p>
In 1994 Mr Edward Ellison, former Operational Detective Chief Inspector, London 
Central Drug Squad, commented on a proposal to increase penalties for possessing 
marijuana that the Home Secretary should "stop fiddling with the engine, you need a new 
car," because "the criminal law, as a policy for controlling individual drug misuse, is so 
palpably failing that protectors of the status quo are thin on the ground". He argued that it 
is now widely acknowledged by senior officers in both police and customs and by a 
growing number of the judiciary that the criminal law is incapable of "hitting the 
individual drug users and it is progressively unable to knock out sufficient of the drug 
suppliers" (<i>The Guardian Weekly</i> 27-2-1994).
<p>
The British newspaper, <i>The Independent</i>, carried an editorial on 3 March 1994 
which declared that "if the government wanted to maximise crime levels, encourage 
burglary, muggings and a proliferation of violent games, it could not have achieved its 
goal more effectively than with its long-standing policies on drugs."  The editorial listed a 
number of consequences of prohibition: innocent people becoming victims of crimes; the 
inadvertent fostering of organised crime; already over-crowded gaols now being 
crammed with illegal drug users and pushers; and entrenched dependence of drug users 
on drug pushers.  <i>The Independent</i> noted that the first step in reform must be to 
destroy the drug economy which brings misery to users and causes millions of other 
people to be victimised by drug-related crime.
<p>
Supporters (and opponents) of prohibition may hope that attempts to restrict drugs reduce 
drug-related crime.  But if anything, prohibition seems to exacerbate crime.  Can this be 
called success?

<b>Has prohibition reduced health problems?</b>
<p>
Deaths from opiates in Australia increased 75 per cent between 1986 and 1992 according 
to Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health figures.  These trends 
should be interpreted cautiously because the numbers of deaths are relatively small.  
Nevertheless, deaths from illicit drug use have been increasing throughout the 1970s and 
1980s.  Heroin overdose deaths have doubled in the last decade.  Although these deaths 
represent only three per cent of all drug-related deaths, the average age of people dying 
from illicit drugs is early twenties.
<p>
Drug-related deaths are not only increasing in Australia.  They have increased by a factor 
of six in Germany and Spain, five in Austria and Italy, four in the Russian Federation, 
three in Belgium, France and Switzerland, and more than one half in the United 
Kingdom.  They are stable in the Netherlands but have also increased in Hong Kong, 
Japan and Saudi Arabia.  Deaths of drug users in the United States are declining on some 
figures while increasing on others.
<p>
There is now little doubt that restricting the supply of sterile needles and syringes, a 
policy which Australia used to enforce consistent with prohibition, increased the sharing 
of injection equipment and spread blood-borne viral infections such as HIV, hepatitis B 
and hepatitis C. Prohibition made it more difficult to control these infections among 
injecting drug users.  Control was only achieved by ignoring or contradicting prohibition.
<p>
Although only a small proportion of the world's HIV/AIDS population are drug injectors, 
uncontrolled epidemics among drug injectors have had catastrophic consequences for the 
general population in many countries.  The table below shows a selection of rates of HIV 
among drug injectors worldwide.
<p>
Within a few years of the introduction of anti-opium laws in Hong Kong (1945), Thailand 
(1959) and Laos (1972), elderly men smoking opium became a rarity.  Soon many young 
men were injecting heroin.  Opium is bulky and smelly and the large implements required 
also make it easy to detect.  Heroin is concentrated, smells less and the implements are 
easy to hide.  Frequent opium smoking is certainly a health hazard but far less damaging 
than heroin injecting.  Now millions in Asia are at risk of HIV infection because of the 
recent diffusion of drug injecting which followed the introduction of anti-opium laws.
<p>
National and global experience suggests that prohibition does not decrease disease and 
deaths.  On the contrary, the evidence points to prohibition increasing health damage 
from drugs.

<b>Is prohibition cost-effective?</b>
<p>
The RAND Drug Policy Research Center in California recently assessed the effectiveness 
of different ways of controlling cocaine in the United States.  For each US dollar spent on 
cocaine control, source-country activities saved 15 cents, interdiction 32 cents, domestic 
enforcement (customs and police) 52 cents, while treatment programs for cocaine users 
generated societal cost savings of $US7.48 for every dollar spent!  How does the US 
allocate funding for cocaine control?  In 1992, 73 per cent went to domestic enforcement, 
13 per cent to interdiction, with source-country control and treatment each allocated 
seven per cent.
<p>
A study commissioned by the Commonwealth Department of Health estimated that in 
1988, Australia spent at least $258 million on illicit drugs law enforcement.  Less 
conservative estimates are about two or three times that figure.  For a country struggling 
with massive foreign debt, high unemployment and low exports, a policy burden which 
costs a quarter of a billion dollars a year to achieve next to nothing is a sacred cow we can 
ill-afford.  In the United States, Federal spending alone on illicit drug law enforcement is 
now up to $US13 billion a year.  When State and local illicit drug law enforcement 
spending is included, the bill probably rises to over $US60 billion.  Curiously, politicians 
and communities are willing to approve vast sums for illicit drug law enforcemerit 
without the evidence of benefit they would demand in any other area of government 
expenditure.

<b>Why geo-political changes make it impossible<br>
for prohibition to work</b>
<p>
Since the collapse of communism in 1989, global instability has markedly increased.  The 
post-cold war era has been remarkable for widening gaps between the underdeveloped 
and developing world.  Free markets have spread.  International economic systems have 
opened in new areas.  Ethnic, religious and nationalist conflicts in the developing world 
and former communist countries have flared up. Social controls in the emerging private 
sector have been reduced, accompanied by widespread graft and corruption in the public 
sector of former communist countries.  Incentives for global drug production are growing 
with diminishing economic prospects for most developing countries.  Opportunities for 
global drug trafficking are expanding with the development of more open and less 
regulated economies.
<p>
Another fundamental factor fuelling the spread of illicit drug production and trafficking is 
the growing importance of terrorist organisations.  These days, most major terrorist 
organisations generate a substantial part of their income from the illicit drugs trade and 
most major illicit drug traffickers are linked to terrorist organisations.  The terrorist 
organisations have the technology and skills needed by drug producers.  Drug producers 
control a trade which provides the lucrative profits so needed by terrorists.
<p>
The CSIS Report noted that "all the coca plants under cultivation throughout the world 
would fill a space not much larger than the eastern shores of Maryland", concluding that 
"the global capacity for the cultivation of coca, opium and cannabis is virtually untapped 
and unlimited".  Geography is clearly not a meaningful constraint on the cultivation of 
illicit drugs.
<p>
Illicit drug production is now concentrated in those parts of the world where there are few 
alternative ways of improving living standards.  Peasants who can earn from growing 
coca, poppies or cannabis up to ten times what they would receive growing traditional 
agricultural products are hardly likely to be concerned about the condition of teenagers in 
Cabramatta or St Kilda.  Drug cultivation now occurs in some of the most remote and 
impoverished places in the world.  For some peasants, growing illicit drug crops means 
the difference between providing for the most basic needs of a family or life-threatening 
poverty.
<p>
Illicit drug cultivation usually occurs in remote border areas controlled by guerilla forces 
and populated by impoverished ethnic minorities beyond the control of central 
governments.  The world's two largest producers of opium poppies are Burma and 
Afghanistan, the main coca producers are Peru and Bolivia, and the world's leading 
producer of hashish is Lebanon.  If prohibition is to be effective, we will need to find 
ways of controlling drug production in nations which are racked by civil war and barely 
members of the international family of nations.

<b>Why technological changes make it even harder<br>for prohibition to work</b>
<p>
During the last decade, communications technology has improved dramatically.  
Although this helps law abiding citizens running legal businesses, technological 
improvement is just as much assistance to those who run different kinds of enterprises.  
Facsimile machines, cellular telephones, paging systems, and computerised banking have 
all made the work of illicit drug traffickers easier.  In 1991, the Clearing House Interbank 
Payment System (CHIPS) handled 37 billion transactions valued at $US222 trillion.  Any 
thought that this might be effectively monitored to detect improper transfers of funds is 
laughable.
<p>
International trade is rapidly expanding.  In 1991, 374 million people, 4.5 million 
containers and 122 million cars and trucks crossed US land borders.  Over 1.8 million 
containers arrived in the port of Newark in 1991 where customs are only able to inspect 
up to 18 containers per day.
<p>
To improve legal trade, vast super-national organisations have emerged.  Other 
organisations are planned.  The North American Free Trade Agreement now links the 340 
million people living in Mexico, the United States and Canada.  Soon goods landed in 
Accupulco will not be inspected again before being transported to Northern Canada.  The 
360 million people living in the European Union must now seem an attractive market for 
drug traffickers.  Illicit drugs landed in Piraeus (Greece) on the way to Gothenburg 
(Sweden) will not be inspected again over a dozen or so border crossings of the European 
superstate.  In our own region, the APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) forum 
will in time also reduce obstacles for drug traffickers anxious to move their goods 
between Asia and Australia.
<p>
The CSIS report (1993) concluded that:
<p>
<blockquote>The ability of a state to prevent drug trafficking either across or within its 
borders is becoming prohibitively costly or hopelessly impractical.  The volume and 
diversity of international trade make it extremely difficult to distinguish between licit and 
illicit goods.  The explosive rise in international travel precludes the ability to thoroughly 
inspect all individuals who cross national borders ...
<p>
To even try to inspect more than the smallest percentage of air passengers at places like 
Heathrow in London or Kennedy International in New York would create travel gridlock 
...
<p>
National efforts to improve interdiction and to contain money laundering generally run 
head-on into domestic economic deregulation designed to improve efficiency and 
international competitiveness.  Finally, the accelerating revolution in transportation and 
communications technologies is simply out-stripping the ability of governments to 
independently develop regulatory regimes and enforcement mechanisms to monitor and 
control their use. Drug traffickers, therefore, have a rising level of drug supplies and also 
a historic opportunity both to service existing markets and to develop new ones. The 
question that remains is to what extent there is an untapped market for widespread drug 
consumption.</blockquote>

<b>Why economic forces make it impossible<br>

<p>
The senior US Federal judge, Whitman Knapp, once had to listen to lengthy surveillance 
tapes of a major New York drug trafficker as part of his judicial duties. One of the 
conversations took place in the late afternoon as an associate of the trafficker entered the 
room and began to exchange pleasantries about how the day had been.  The drug 
trafficker responded that it had been a great day.  "Prices are up!  The cops just made 
another bust". (Speech to Merchants' Club, New York 26.3.1993.)
<p>
Conservative estimates of the annual turnover of the global illicit drug industry range 
from $US400 to $US500 billion.  This is equivalent to approximately ten per cent of total 
international trade.  The global illicit drug industry is larger than all international trade in 
each of the following sectors: oil and gas; food, beverages and alcohol; chemicals and 
pharmaceuticals; and the textiles and clothing industry.  The turnover of the world's illicit 
drug industry is about twice that of the global pharmaceutical industry, and several times 
bigger than either the global motor vehicle or iron and steel industries.  Turnover in illicit 
drugs is seven to eight times worldwide foreign aid.  Over 90 per cent of the profits made 
from cocaine and heroin are generated during the distribution of these drugs, with only 
ten per cent during cultivation and production.  A gram of cocaine from Colombia sells in 
the United States for between $US60 and $US300, of which 95 per cent represents profit.  
Heroin costing about $US3000 a kilogram in Pakistan sells for $US90,000 on the streets 
of Europe, with 95 per cent of the retail price being profit.  As nearly half of the final 
price of drugs is added in the national distribution networks of developed countries, 
however successful efforts are to restrict cultivation, production and transport to 
consumer nations, prohibition cannot win.
<p>
Almost 108 tonnes of cocaine were seized in the United States in 1993.  This represented 
a street value of between $US10 and $US20 billion, larger than the individual Gross 
National Product (GNP) of more than half the countries in the world.  The largest single 
national consumer of illicit drugs in the world, the United States, has more than 11.4 
million consumers.
<p>
In Australia, annual turnover of the illicit drug industry was estimated by a parliamentary 
committee in 1989 to be $2.6 billion.  Cannabis is the second biggest agricultural crop in 
Queensland, after sugar and ahead of wheat.  The illicit drug industry in 1989 represented 
15 per cent of Bolivia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and up to 11 per cent of Peru's 
GDP (the world's largest coca cultivator), and up to 13 per cent of Colombia's GDP in 
1991.  The illicit opioid industry added four per cent to the GDP of Pakistan.  This may 
not be as beneficial for these countries as may seem at first.  The contribution of the illicit 
drug industry to the economy of these countries increases their exchance rate, 
discouraging diversification of the economy and endangering export-oriented and import-
substituting industries.  Employment generated by opium production represented one per 
cent of the labour force in Pakistan, while the coca industry involved up to 4.5 per cent of 
the economically active popolation in Peru and up to 17 per cent of the economically 
active population in Bolivia.  The value of coca and cocaine exports to Bolivia in 1990 is 
equivalent to about half the total legal exports.  Illicit drug exports from Pakistan are 
estimated at $US1.5 billion in 1992 compared with legal exports of $US7.3 billion.
<p>
The costs of illicit drugs have been estimated conservatively to be equivalent to 0.5 per 
cent of GDP in both Australia and the United Kingdom and $US76 billion or 1.3 per cent 
of GDP in the United States in 1991.  Almost half of the costs of drug use are due to an 
inability of most drug users to earn a decent income, while drucg users' health costs are 
almost 80 per cent higher than those of other citizens of similar age.
<p>
Sales of cocaine, heroin and cannabis amounted to an estimated $US122 billion per year 
in the United States and Europe during the 1980s, leaving 70 per cent ($US85 billion) 
available for laundering and investment.  Others estimated that up to $US300 billion per 
year might have been available for laundering in the late 1980s.  The current figure is 
believed to be about $US350 billion per year in the 1990s but some estimates go as high 
as $US500 billion.  Even the lowest estimate of $US85 billion would make the drug 
money available for laundering larger than the individual GNPs of 34 of the 207 
economies of the world, white the hichest estimate of $US500 billion would be 
equivalent to about a tenth of the GNP of the United States.
<p>
There is a growing sense that prohibition can never succeed.  Former US Secretary of 
State, Mr George Schultz, said that the war against drugs is doomed to fail because "the 
conceptual base of the current program is flawed ... we need at least, to consider and 
examine forms of controlled legalisation of drugs." (The Wall Street Journal 27.10.1990). 
Is it any wonder that he supports a new approach to drugs policy "cutting out the middle 
man" and "supplying the drugs in some other way"?
<p>
A Report to the President of the United States by the US Attorneys and The Attomey-
General in 1989 concluded that "peasants have turned to cultivating the coca plant 
because it is the most lucrative cash crop, offering in one season an income equivalent to 
many a year's effort growing traditional crops".  The same report noted that "the 
Colombian Government was able to avoid rescheduling its foreign debt payments due to 
the positive economic effects of the drug boom".  Even Princess Anne has suggested that 
"asking South American peasants to stop growing coca was like asking the Scots to stop 
growing barley because people on the other side of the world could not hold their drink" 
(The Independent 11.4.1990).
<p>
The flaw referred to by George Schultz is the steep economic gradient down which illicit 
drugs slide from supplier to consumer.  The more successfully law enforcement maintains 
higher prices, the more it creates extraordinary profits.  These profits attract the very 
entrepreneurs the authorities seeks to discourage by enforcing the laws which created the 
profitable markets and attracted the entrepreneurs in the first place.  No wonder an 
editorial in The Times of London (10.4.1990) concluded that "only when supply is taxed 
and regulated can criminals be removed from the supplier chain, and demand tackled 
through education and taxation.  An unwelcome industry which cannot be contained, let 
alone banned, must be regulated some other way".
<p>
Mark Kleiman, former Director of the Office of Policy and Management Analysis of the 
Criminal Division, US Department of Justice, estimated in his book <i>Marijuana: Cost 
of Abuse, Cost of Control</i>, that halving the 1986 US Federal marijuana enforcement 
budget would save $320 million in expenditure, free prison cells for other offenders, 
reduce the earnings of marijuana dealers and the drug budgets of marijuana users by two 
per cent, but would increase marijuana consumption by only 1.5 per cent.
<p>
Forty per cent - $US423 million - of the US Federal Government drug enforcement 
budget of $US1.1 billion in 1982 was spent on marijuana-related investigations, 
prosecutions and incarcerations.  Between 1982 and 1986, the US Federal Government 
increased the marijuana enforcement budget by $US636 million.  Estimated total 
marijuana consumption fell per cent (by volume) between 1982 and 1985 but because of 
per cent increase in average potency, consumption of the main ingredient (THC) actually 
increased 22 per cent.  In constant dollars, law enforcement costs had risen by one-third 
since 1982, imposing an additional 20 per cent cost on the marijuana market.  However, 
the imported and domestic marijuana market grew 50 per cent, from $US9.4 billion to 
$US 14 billion.  Kleiman estimated that if the enforcement budget was halved, prices 
would decrease 3.5 per cent and consumption increase 1.5 per cent.  As Kleiman points 
out, there is a limit to how much damage the state might want to inflict on consumers of 
illicit substances to prevent them from damaging themselves.  Kleiman noted that druc, 
policy reform risks additional consumption in order to reduce harm to consumers, while 
prohibition increases potential damage in order to reduce consumption.
<p>
In June 1995, Henry Loa'za Ceballos, also known as "The Scorpion", gave himself up in 
Colombia after a $US500,000 ransom had been placed on his head.  He was wanted for a 
number of atrocities related to drug trafficking, including the massacre in 1991 of 107 
peasants who were dismembered with chainsaws.  President Ernesto Samper of Colombia 
still carries four bullets in his body from a shooting incident at Bogota airport in 1989, 
which resulted in the death of the politician he was conversing with.  Yet Samper has also 
been accused of receiving funds for his political campaigns from the Cali cartel.  In July 
1995, the Treasurer for Samper's re-election campaian was arrested because Cali drug 
funds were traced directly to the re-election account.
<p>
Colombian authorities recently arrested Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, known as "The 
Chess Player", but better known as the head of the Cali cartel which is believed to control 
80 per cent of the world's cocaine supply.  This cartel is believed to generate $US44 
million per day and to have smuggled more than 210,000 tons of cocaine out of Colombia 
since 1983.  Orejuela had been protected by his own security forces headed by senior ex-
policemen.  Following his arrest, 29 people in the centre of Medellin were killed when a 
statue of a dove of peace was blown up, apparently the work of a drug cartel intending to 
send a warning to the government against any attempt to dismantle the narco-trafficking 
industry.  Three days later, the national head of counter-inteltigence was assassinated.
<p>
"The Chess Player"disdained the violent ways of Pablo Escobar.  "We don"t kill judges 
or ministers.  We buy them" (The Guardian Weekly 18.6.1995). Yet authorities took no 
chances.  Orejuela was interrogated by four judges hidden behind one way mirrors with 
voices altered to protect their anonymity.  By the end of the first day's interrogation, the 
cartel had already worked out the identity of at least one of the judges.  In August 1995, 
police captured Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, the sixth of the seven known cartel leaders to 
be arrested so far.  A month earlier, Miguel Rodriguez had left evidence of far-reaching 
corruption for police to find.  This led to the resignation of the Defence Minister, 
Fernando Botero, as well as calls for the impeachment of the President and the 
subsequent declaration of a state of emergency.  It is abundantly clear that one of the 
poorest countries in South America is being destabilised politically and economically by 
an illicit trade - feeding a demand in other countries - which it is powerless to control.
<p>
A decade ago in Colombia, 1500 people were arrested and 12 tons of cocaine destroyed 
in one operation.  But it made no difference to the cartels.  When Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, 
then Minister of Justice, was accused of taking drug money, he responded by intensifying 
the search for drug traffickers and seizing many of their planes.  Within a year, he had 
been shot dead on the streets of Bogota.  In the first five years of the 1990s in Colombia - 
a country with a population of 36 million - more than 1500 politicians and union leaders, 
more than 1000 police officers, 70 journalists, four of six presidential candidates in 1990, 
an attorney-general and a governor have been killed.
<p>
Former Colombian Prosecutor-General, Gustavo de Greiff, argued that "a kilo of cocaine 
costs $US50 in the trafficking countries and is sold in the consuming, countries for 
$US5000 to $10,000, and so there will always be someone ready to run the risk of the 
illegitimate business".  De Greiff, who was responsible for the apprehension of cocaine 
cartel boss Pablo Escobar, pointed out that Escobar had already been replaced by the time 
of his arrest and argued that:
<p>
<blockquote>Traffickers do not deserve the profits we are helping them to gain.  Our 
efforts to curtail production and impede the sale of drugs keep in place a complex set of 
institutions ... that consume billions of dollars and imperil the lives of thousands in both 
the United States and Colombia and whose chief effect, judging from the results we have, 
is to reward the traffickers and their associates by keeping the price of their deadly 
merchandise artificially high. (The Washington Post 11.3.1994.)</blockquote>
<p>
"Nothing will really change" said Maria Jimna Duzan, whose own sister was killed 
making a documentary about drug trafficking in Colombia, "until the world understands 
that the problem involves not just drug-trafficking but drug consumption and that it 
reaches to the heart of the industrial world, not just the relatively poor producer Nations" 
(The Guardian Weekly 18.6.1995). The celebrated Colombian novelist Gabriel Garcia 
Marquez has forecast that a failure by the world to realise this will mean that Colombia 
"will rot alive in a war that cannot be won - and the rest of the world will rot with us" 
(The New York Times 20.2.1994). As long as there are consumers willing to pay for their 
pleasures and peasants in producer countries earn ten to 20 times more cultivating drugs 
than they would from traditional crops, the drug trade will continue.  It may be forced to 
shift from one neighbourhood to another, from one province to another, from one country 
to another, or even one continent to another, but the drug trade can only grow while such 
vast profits are there to be made.
<p>
A more fundamental question is the extent to which economic forces influence the 
dynamics of the drug market.  Prohibition assumes that raising the health, social, 
financial and legal costs of drugs deters potential consumers and perhaps accelerates the 
early retirement of current users from drug use.  Defenders of prohibition maintain that 
any relaxation of enforcement efforts would only lower prices with an inevitable increase 
in recruitment of new users.  Drug reformers argue that it is the lucrative profits which 
maintain the growth of the illicit drugs industry and lead to recruitment of new 
consumers.  While conceding some logic in the notion that lower prices may recruit new 
consumers, reformers argue that this trend is likely to be more than offset by "taking the 
oxygen out of the drug trafficking trade".  If drug trafficking becomes less lucrative, 
fewer individuals will be attracted to the trade and there will be less pressure to recruit 
new consumers.

<b>How prohibition damages the environment</b>
<p>
Severe environmental damage is reported from the cultivation and refining operations of 
the illicit drug industry in the Andes.  Coca farmers cut down forests on steep hillsides 
leading to erosion.  An estimated 700,000 hectares in the Amazon region of Peru was 
deforested as a result of coca cultivation.  Two to six hectares of forest are cleared by 
farmers in Bolivia for each hectare of coca production, suggesting, that between 260,000 
and 780,000 hectares have been cleared each year for coca production compared to 
250,000 hectares lost annually from timber extraction and cattle ranching.  In South East 
Asia, hill tribes use traditional slash and burn agriculture to clear enormous areas of 
rainforest for poppy cultivation, damaging the environment through denudation, topsoil 
loss and river silting.  In Bolivia, 30,000 tonnes of toxic chemicals including lime, 
sulphuric acid, kerosene, acetone and hydrochloric acid used to process illicit drugs are 
flushed down the river systems each year without any proper waste-water treatment, and 
around 200,000 tonnes of discarded, contaminated coca leaf are left to rot into the soil 
each year.  In Peru, chemicals used to process drugs have killed off whole species of fish 
and aquatic plants in the river systems.  Cocaine processes in the Andes have dumped ten 
million litres of sulphuric acid, eight million litres of acetone and between 40 and 770 
litres of kerosene into the rivers.

<b>Has prohibition ever worked?</b>
<p>
The Report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority 
<i>Drugs, Ciime And Society</i> (1989), which was an all party committee of the 
Federal Parliament, concluded that:
<p>
<blockquote>Over the past two decades in Australia we have devoted increased resources 
to drug law enforcement, we have increased the penalties for drug trafficking and we 
have accepted increasing inroads on our civil liberties as part of the battle to curb the drug 
trade.  All the evidence shows, however, not only that our law enforcement agencies have 
not succeeded in preventing the supply of illicit drugs to Australian markets but that it is 
unrealistic to expect them to do so.  If the present policy of prohibition is not working 
then it is time to give serious consideration to the alternatives, however radical they may 
seem.</blockquote>
<p>
Opponents of prohibition sometimes say that it never works, but this is not entirely true.  
Prohibition does work for certain drugs in certain countries at certain times in history.  
First, the prohibited drug must be desired by few people.  Second, the drug has to be 
difficult to manufacture or smuggle.  Third, substitute drugs must not be even more 
dangerous than the banned drug.  Fourth, it helps if the country is isolated and its 
government authoritarian.
<p>
In the 1960s, Australia had the highest incidence in the world of a particular kind of 
kidney disease due to compound analgesics (made up of aspirin, phenacetin and caffeine).  
Compound analgesics were readily available from dispensaries in many offices and 
factories where staff took a few pills whenever they experienced a minor discomfort. 
After Australia banned compound analgesics, this kind of kidney disease disappeared. No 
negative consequences of this policy were detected. Prohibition worked because demand 
was weak.
<p>
Prohibition may also have been a successful policy for the first five or six decades of the 
century. After all, drug consumption globally was very low and drug problems were rare 
(apart from in the United States). Again, prohibition worked because demand was weak. 
It has only really been in the last quarter century, as demand and supply increased, that 
concern has grown about the effectiveness of prohibition.
<p>
Nevertheless, prohibition may still work for certain countries.  Prohibition seemed to 
work for China from the 1949 revolution until the 1980s. Drug consumption was 
apparently low and drug-related problems rare. However, China paid a high price for this 
apparent success - few countries today would wish to consider paying this price even if it 
were possible - China was isolated from the rest of the world and experienced poor 
economic growth despite grinding poverty. The opening up of China's borders and 
liberalisation of economic policies has improved living conditions.  But this too has come 
at a hich price. As a Chinese leader once said, "when you open the windows, the gnats 
and mosquitoes fly in". Liberalisation has brought prostitution, venereal disease, HIV 
infection, opium cultivation, heroin injection and HIV infection among drug injectors 
along the heroin trade routes from the south west to the east of the country.
<p>
There may also be other "special case" countries such as Singapore. It is difficult, 
however, to generalise from this island police state to other countries. Authorities in 
Singapore are able to implement measures unthinkable in most other countries. Norway 
might be another country where prohibition has helped to keep drug problems at low 
levels. Norway is geographically somewhat isolated and civil liberties in Scandinavia has 
a very different meaning than in most other liberal western democracies.
<p>
Perhaps prohibition works under certain circumstances but not under others. Prohibition 
does not appear to work well when potential source and potential demand countries are 
well connected by obstacle-free extensive legal trading and while highly mobile 
populations are cheaply and easily transported.  It does not help when there is a 
proliferation of terrorist groups desiring large incomes and possessing the necessary skills 
and technology to conduct business with drug traffickers.  Nor does it seem to work well 
in an era when crushing poverty, increasing inequality and rampant social injustice 
coexist side by side with privilege and affluence.
<p>
Like everything else, prohibition can be made to work if communities are willing to pay a 
sufficiently high price.  That price may include suspension of most civil liberties, 
isolation and restricted contact (including international trade) with other countries.  In 
supplier countries, there have been major sacrifices in the name of prohibition, including 
the overthrow of a government and major violence involving the assassination of 
ministers, judges, presidential candidates and the downing of an airliner with all 200 
people on board killed.  Corruption seems to be an almost inevitable companion to 
prohibition.  In Australia, there have been a dozen Royal Commissions and other official 
enquiries into drug trafficking and police corruption.
<p>
<a href="#has">Top</a>

<a name="clu"></a>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
The 1993 World Bank Report, <i>Investing in Health</i>, noted that "the success 
achieved in controlling the use of alcohol and tobacco through restrictions on promotion 
and access, high taxation, rehabilitation of addicts, and public education - may also be 
relevant for efforts with other drugs".  Although officially, Governments and authorities 
still deny that prohibition has failed, many official reports and enquiries have reached this 
conclusion.  The US President's 1986 Commission on Organised Crime, <i>America's 
Habit: Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking And Organised Crime</i>, concluded that "despite 
continuing expressions of determination, America's war on drugs seems nowhere close to 
success".  The 1990 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report concluded that 
"although precise information is difficult to obtain, it also seems that worldwide abuse of 
drugs is increasing.  A number of countries reported or were estimated to have, more 
intense drug abuse problems than in previous years".
<p>
The CSIS report (1993) concluded as follows:
<p>
<blockquote>The participants reached a sobering consensus around the following issues: 
(1) the production of heroin, cocaine, cannabis, and synthetic drugs is at a record high and 
will continue to rise in the foreseeable future; (2) drug trafficking organisations are taking 
advantage of the tumultuous changes throughout the international system to develop 
aggressively new markets for their products; (3) the seeds for widespread drug 
consumption exists practically everywhere as do the worrisome signs that the drug 
epidemic is spreading swiftly to the Third World and many of the former Communist 
states; (4) the current US National Drug Control Strategy is simply no match for the 
challenge.</blockquote>
<p>
We have seen that under prohibition more opium and coca are cultivated almost every 
year.  Refining these plants into drugs presents no problem to the drug traffickers.  Only a 
small proportion of illicit drugs are detected during transport.  Sales occur with minimal 
impediment.  Prohibition has been successful in raising the health, social and economic 
costs of drug use.  But it has not succeeded in reducing drug use.  Prohibition has been an 
expensive, ineffective and counterproductive failure.  Not only has prohibition failed, it 
has no chance of succeeding.  Each year, technolocical change, geopolitical developments 
and the new trade environment make the job of prohibition even harder.
<p>
Prohibition is like trying to empty Sydney Harbour with a bucket.  Law enforcement 
officials can point to the amount of water scooped up and show that more water was 
scooped up this year.  Politicians can make larger and more expensive buckets available.  
But the net result is unchanged.
<p>
Global political trends, technological change and the economic fundamentals 
underpinning the illicit drug market suggest that prohibition will never be successful.  
Not surprisingly, many now consider that prohibition of illicit drugs during the last 
quarter century has been as much a resounding failure as alcohol prohibition in the United 
States was a half century earlier.
<p>
On 17 December 1992, Mr Jim Snow MP, Federal Member for Eden-Monaro, moved in 
the House of Representatives:
<p>
That This House - 
<p>
<ol>
<li>declares that urgent action is needed to deal with organised crime, death and health 
and social problems associated with illegal drug use; and

<li>calls on the Executive to initiate action with the States to:<br>
(a) oversee the sale of drugs of addiction such as heroin and other opiates, cocaine and 
amphetamines by prescription; and<br>
(b) ensure that prescribers are approved physicians and that dispensers are approved 
pharmacists, all having completed appropriate additional training.
<p>
</ol>
After 20 minutes' discussion the debate was adjourned.
<p>
As mentioned at the beginning of chapter 2, Mr Snow had been a pharmacist in 
Queanbeyan, where he had dispensed heroin linctus to his patients - legally prescribed 
such medication by their doctors - before heroin was banned.  His memory of how well 
his patients managed before prohibition prompted him almost 40 years later to introduce 
this motion to the National Parliament.  Mr Snow knew that prohibition has failed and 
that alternatives exist.
<p>
Gabriel Garcia Marquez said in a recent essay that consuming and producing countries 
should "grab the bull by the horns and concentrate on the various possible ways of 
administering legalisation" (The New York Times 20.2.1994).
<p>
In the next chapter we examine those alternatives.

<b>What should a drug policy try to achieve?</b>
<p>
Drug policies should aim to reduce harms caused by drugs; they must be realistic.  There 
is no point having a policy which looks great on paper or in the voting booth but does not 
work in practice.  Drug policies should be designed to reflect the variety of problems that 
drugs can cause and the variety of drug types.  Policies designed to discourage drug 
consumption should only be supported if they prevent more harm than they cause.  In 
other words the costs of policies must be weighed up against their benefits, and benefits 
should exceed costs.  Effective drug policies should not be confused with moral crusades.
<p>
Effective drug policy can minimise harm by reducing the number of people who use a 
drug and the amount they use, or by minimising the harms directly caused by drugs 
without interfering with consumption.  Some policies do a bit of both.  Too often, 
attempts to reduce consumption continue even where they clearly maximise harm.  
Where drugs have clear benefits, such as pain relief from opium derivatives, drug policy 
should ensure benefits are maximised.
<p>

<b>Are there alternatives to prohibition?</b>
<p>
The General Accounting Office (GAO), a research arm of the United States Congress, 
released a report in 1993 entitled <i>Confronting the Drug Problem: Debate Persists on 
Enforcement and Alternative Approaches</i>. Illicit drug problems in the US are far 
more severe than in Australia. As in Australia, a fierce debate about prohibition rages. 
This study identified eight alternative approaches and examined arguments for and 
against each of them.
<p>
<i>Expanding drug prevention efforts</i>
<p>
US Federal drug prevention spending increased from $US186 million in 1986, when 
prevention constituted seven per cent of the drug control budget, to $US1.7 billion in 
1992, representing 14 per cent of the Federal drug control budget. Supporters of 
prevention programs regard reduced levels of consumption of alcohol, tobacco and illegal 
drugs as indicators of effectiveness. Opponents argue that decreasing consumption of 
these drugs may have more to do with changing social and cultural norms and 
enforcement efforts than drug prevention programs. The GAO report concluded that 
effectiveness of prevention programs has generally been mixed. Drug education, 
workplace drug testing or community-based, comprehensive approaches were regarded as 
promising but there was limited solid evaluation of effectiveness. Opinions were divided 
about whether amelioration of adverse social conditions might reduce demand for drugs, 
with some critics maintaining that drug use is not caused by these conditions.
<p>
<i>Expanding drug treatment efforts</i>
<p>
US Federal drug treatment spending increased from $US628 million in 1986, 
representing 22 per cent of the then Federal drug control budget, to $US2.1 billion in 
1992, representing 17 per cent. An official US Government agency estimated in 1992 that 
the nation's treatment capacity could serve only about 1.7 million of the 2.8 million drug 
users who might benefit from treatment. A Californian Study estimated that $US11 
savings in social costs resulted from every dollar invested in treatment. Costs of 
providing treatment were estimated to reach $US50,000 per person per year for 
incarceration, or $US100,000 per person per year for injecting drug users who developed 
AIDS.  The prestigious Institute of Medicine concluded in a 1990 report that "methadone 
maintenance has been the most rigorously studied treatment type and that it has yielded 
positive results in terms of reducing illicit drug use and criminal activity of opioid-
dependent individuals" (Gerstein & Harwood 1990).  An Office of Technology 
Assessment Report in 1990 concluded that the safety and effectiveness of methadone 
maintenance treatment had been established in numerous studies and that in a substantial 
majority, drug use and criminality decreased and health improved.  Residential treatment 
programs were estimated to cost four to seven times as much as methadone treatment.  
The Institute of Medicine study estimated that between a third and a half of clients remain 
in residential treatment long enough to benefit.  Outpatient programs were considered less 
effective but also less expensive.
<p>
<i>Increasing use of coercive treatment</i>
<p>
This approach involves increasing links between treatment and the criminal justice 
system by encouraging offenders to participate in drug education or treatment programs 
as an alternative to punishment.
<p>
<i>Increasing use of alternative penalties</i>
<p>
This approach includes the military-like environment of boot camps, operated in 26 states 
of the US, and is generally reserved for young, non-violent, first time offenders.  Early 
evaluations show only marginal improvement over traditional forms of incarceration.  
However, boot camps might be cheaper than prisons.  Intensive supervision of probation 
targets certain offenders for increased surveillance.  This may involve electronic 
monitoring but often includes up to five meetings a week with a probation or parole 
officer, which is more costly than traditional programs but less expensive than prison.  
Nine US states have introduced a range of criminal or civil fines which do not mention 
incarceration for the first-time possession of a small amount of marijuana.  No 
conclusions were reached about the effectiveness of these measures because of 
insufficient survey data.  Expunction of criminal justice or civil records of those 
convicted of less serious drug offences has been introduced in some states but without 
clear evidence of net cost or benefit.
<p>
<i>Increasing use of conditional discharges</i>
<p>
This approach allows courts to dismiss charges against less serious drug offenders if they 
complete a period meeting certain conditions such as finishing drug education, treatment 
programs or demonstrating abstinence through regular drug tests.  Some evidence 
suggests that this approach is associated with longer durations of treatrnent which in turn 
are associated with better outcomes.
<p>
<i>Eliminating penalties for drug use</i>
<p>
Eliminating criminal and civil penalties for possessing personal use amounts of an illegal 
drug is an approach adopted for alcohol in some US counties, where it is illegal to sell but 
not to use alcohol.  Penalties for possession of personal use amounts have been 
eliminated in Spain and de facto in the Netherlands, where the law remains unchanged on 
the books but prosecution is only invoked if it is in the national interest.  The law has 
been extended in some western European countries to cocaine, heroin and marijuana.  
Heroin-related deaths have increased in Spain, Italy and western Europe generally but 
have not increased in the Netherlands, possibly due to the increasing use of heroin by 
snorting.
<p>
<i>Expanding physician prescription authority<br>as a drug treatment alternative</i>
<p>
A UK study found that those prescribed injectable heroin had higher retention rates and 
lower arrest rates than those on oral methadone who had less opiate use.
<p>
<i>Authorising a regulated drug market</i>
<p>
This approach involves converting an illegal market for drugs such as cocaine, heroin or 
marijuana to a regulated market.  A variety of models have been proposed, including 
alternative methods of production, distribution, packaging, labelling and varieties of 
permissible advertising.  Enforcement would be retained for selling or using any drug that 
remains illegal or illicitly providing legal drugs to minors.  Because drug prices would be 
lower in a regulated market, it is expected that users would be less inclined to commit 
offences to obtain money to support their habits.  Prices are likely to be eight to 70 times 
higher at present than if sold legally in a regulated market.  A study of over 200 drug-
related murders in New York City in 1988 concluded that 74 per cent were related to the 
illegal drug market, four per cent to attempts to finance drug habits, 14 per cent to 
behavioural influences of drugs, with eight per cent resulting from a combination of the 
above factors.  Other arguments advanced in favour of a regulated market include the 
possibility of diverting funds previously allocated to law enforcement to drug prevention 
and treatment.  Some argue that drugs could hardly be made more available in a regulated 
market than they are now in some drug-dealing neighbourhoods in the US.  Monitoring 
quality and ensuring proper potency were other arguments noted in favour of a regulated 
drug market.
<p>
Opponents argue that criminal activity would simply shift to other areas.  They claim 
crimes committed under the behavioural influence of these drugs would increase.  Drug 
use could expand because of implied societal approval of drug use, increased availability 
in terms of ease of purchase and lower price, elimination of the deterrent effect of law 
enforcement, lower perceived health risks and removal of the danger of becoming a crime 
victim if it became possible to purchase the substance from a legitimate business in a 
low-crime area.  A regulated market for marijuana was regarded as an additional option 
which could be considered even while prohibition was continued for other currently 
illegal drugs.

<b>Australian options</b>
<p>
In 1994, a Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health monograph, 
entitled <i>Legislative options for cannabis in Australia</i>, set out the advantages and 
disadvantages of five legislative options.  These options were largely based on a 1979 
South Australian Royal Commission, which in turn was influenced by an earlier 
Canadian Royal Commission.  The same options apply for illicit drugs other than 
cannabis.
<p>
<i>Total prohibition</i>
<p>
As the monograph explained, "under the system of total prohibition the use, possession, 
cultivation, importation, sale and distribution of any amount of cannabis are treated as 
criminal offences".  However, the report goes on to explain that the effect of total 
prohibition can vary substantially because of different ways of enforcing policy.  In the 
Netherlands, relevant legislation has statements appended indicating that prosecution will 
only be invoked if it is in the national interest.  In contrast, US policy has been 
increasingly toughened to the point where the notion of "zero tolerance" was accepted.  
This means showing no distinction between different degrees of offence.  Perhaps the 
most telling criticism of this kind of approach is the evidence suggesting that harms 
caused by drug control regimes have outweighed the harms prevented by them.
<p>
Although the more liberal Dutch approach does not appear to have resulted in increased 
drug use and may have assisted by reducing drug-related problems, it is sometimes 
criticised on the grounds of inconsistency between laws and practice.  Nevertheless, the 
Netherlands has been in a difficult situation for many years, surrounded by countries 
hostile to its drug policy, and the current solution may be the least detrimental option for 
them.
<p>
<i>Prohibition with civil penalties</i>
<p>
The monograph defines this approach as follows: "under the prohibition/civil penalty 
option, penalties for possession and cultivation of small amounts of cannabis for personal 
use are dealt with by civil sanctions, such as monetary penalties, rather than criminal 
sanctions such as fines and imprisonment.  Criminal sanctions still apply to the 
possession, cultivation and distribution of large quantities of cannabis".  The cannabis 
expiation notice (CEN) system introduced in South Australia in 1987 and later followed 
in the ACT is an example of such an approach.  Careful analysis of cannabis consumption 
rates before and after the introduction of this policy has led to the conclusion that 
liberalisation has not increased use in South Australia.  However, critics point out that the 
CEN may have unintentionally "widened the net" - catching more people.  This 
emphasises the point that within each major option there are multiple choices involving 
finer details of policy which have a profound influence on the actual outcome.
<p>
<i>Partial prohibition</i>
<p>
This is defined as "an option which seeks to maintain the controls on production and 
distribution of cannabis, while at the same time avoiding the costs of criminalising use of 
the drug.  Under partial prohibition, it would remain an offence to grow or deal in 
cannabis in commercial quantities.  It would not be an offence to use cannabis, or to 
possess or grow it in quantities judged appropriate for personal use".  Some regard partial 
prohibition as inherently unstable, arguing that maintaining the supply side as illegal 
while removing criminal sanctions from the demand side will inevitably lead to a 
breakdown of the system sooner or later.
<p>
<i>Regulation</i>
<p>
This is defined as a framework where "the production, distribution and sale of cannabis 
would be controlled to a greater or lesser extent by the government.  Trafficking outside 
the regulated system would continue to be a criminal offence and attract penalties.  
However, activities associated with personal use would not be penalised".  In the 
Netherlands, there is increasing support for "cleaning up the back door" now that the 
"front door" has been cleaned up.  By this, the Dutch mean that it is time to regularise an 
inconsistent system.  Methadone maintenance can be considered a form of regulation in 
the sense that governments are willing to tolerate the supply of certain drugs to certain 
persons under highly controlled conditions.  The trial currently underway of controlled 
availability of heroin and other substances in Switzerland and a similar proposed trial for 
controlled availability of heroin in the ACT are further examples of regulated approaches 
to drug control.  Under this system, unauthorised persons who cultivate, produce, 
transport, sell or possess large quantities of mood-altering substances would continue to 
attract penalties as they do today for large quantities of alcohol and tobacco.  In our view, 
a regulated system has the likely greatest benefits and least costs while still being 
consistent with Australia's international treaty obligations.  These allow for medical 
treatment and research involving substances prohibited in the Conventions.  In fact, some 
of the treaties commit signatories to provide high quality treatment and rehabilitation.
<p>
Adopting a regulated approach to cannabis is unlikely to happen in one step.  We will 
probably proceed incrementally.  The proposed trial of controlled availability of heroin in 
the ACT provides a very helpful model for the development and evaluation of controlled 
availability systems for other drugs.
<p>
Perhaps the biggest weakness of this system is that while regulation of supply and 
distribution of cannabis seems to be politically possible, and while the controlled 
availability of heroin and similar drugs for drug-dependent persons through government 
clinics might be politically achievable, it is hard to imagine that this system could ever be 
extended to embrace recreational users.  By definition, they could not be catered for in 
this system while remaining consistent with our treaty obligations.  On the other hand, it 
is quite conceivable that consumption of illicit drugs (apart from cannabis) will fall 
substantially when the enormous profits are taken out of the distribution system.  
Therefore, there are likely to be fewer recreational users under a regulated system than 
under the present system of total prohibition.
<p>
<i>Free availability</i>
<p>
This approach is the exact opposite of total prohibition and involves the absence of any 
legislative or regulatory restrictions on cultivation, importation, sale, supply, possession 
or use. It is hard to imagine this option ever being seriously considered. Also, 
governments are unlikely to forgo the revenue which would become available in a 
regulated system.
<p>
<a href="#aims">Top</a>
<p>
<a name="mod"></a>
<b>Other models</b>
<p>
One of the many myths of prohibition is that we have no experience of models other than 
total prohibition. For a start, most communities including our own had what amounts to a 
free availability of all drugs in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Perhaps the 
largest international example of regulated supply or controlled availability was the 44 
intravenous morphine maintenance clinics operated in the United States between 1919 
and 1923. Some clinics were better run than others, but their closure had nothing to do 
with effectiveness. The clinics were closed because they were considered inconsistent 
with the recently introduced prohibition of alcohol. Agents charged with responsibility 
for alcohol prohibition were also made responsible for narcotics. The prestigious New 
York Academy of Medicine tried to revise this approach in 1955 although it was never 
implemented.
<p>
Less well known is the recent experience with prescribing intravenous morphine in Italy. 
Unpublished material shows this treatment was extensively available, especially in the 
South of the country. Results were similar to the oral methadone program. In Britain, the 
option of prescribing currently illicit drugs has been available since 1926. Medical 
practitioners have been permitted to prescribe such drugs to selected patients when all 
other treatment options have been tried unsuccessfully "in order for them to lead a more 
normal and useful life". The "so-called" British policy has been idiosyncratically 
implemented, poorly documented and poorly evaluated. However, a study of almost 90 
heroin addicts reported in 1980 showed that those receiving injectable heroin were more 
likely to remain in treatment and less likely to be arrested while those assigned to oral 
methadone were more likely to cease opiate use or use smaller amounts. Overall, there 
was little to choose between the two options.
<p>
The global experience with controlling legal drug supplies is also relevant. In the 1950s 
in Sweden, individuals were only permitted a certain quantity of alcohol per week in what 
was virtually a regulated system. In the Canadian Province of Ontario, the government 
still runs a liquor control board which has a monopoly on alcohol supplies.  In Finland, 
the government controls the supply and production of alcoholic beverages.
<p>
An excellent paper outlining a detailed proposal for reform was released recently by the 
Redfern Legal Centre, Sydney (Burrows, 1995).  This paper discusses banning cannabis 
smoking where tobacco smoking is banned, taxation and advertising controls on other 
currently illicit drugs, and shows how currently illicit drugs could be regulated.  As in 
many areas of policy, most options have been tried before.  To suggest there is no 
international experience of alternatives to prohibition is arrant nonsense.  It is the fear of 
change, not absence of alternatives, which prevents us from thinking about options 
despite the evident failure of prohibition.
<p>
The next chapter examines how we can move from the current position to the policies we 
wish to consider.

<b>Is drug policy reform possible?</b>
<p>
Many people over the years have dismissed drug policy reform as a pipe dream.  They 
claimed it will never attract sufficient political or community support.  Politicians 
advocating reform, they argued, would be swiftly punished by the voting public.
<p>
No-one should underestimate the difficulty of achieving major change in such a sensitive 
area.  Yet during the last decade in Australia, there has been a readiness to support change 
unthinkable a generation ago.
<p>
When the Queen visited the New South Wales Parliament in February 1992, two 
members were severely criticised for declining to attend formal functions because of their 
pro-republican sentiments.  Yet within a few years, Australians began to think seriously 
about republicanism.  This experience demonstrates to us how quickly the unthinkable 
can become the thinkable.  As the late Harold Wilson once remarked, "a week is a long 
time in politics".
<p>
Who would have thought a decade ago that the Soviet Union and its satellites had only 
months to last?  Who would have thought a generation ago that Chinese communists 
would introduce a stock exchange and capitalism?  Who would have thought a decade 
ago that apartheid would be dismantled peacefully and that progress towards peace would 
be achieved around a negotiating table in the Middle East and in Ireland?
<p>
Those who say that prohibition will never be reformed deny the events of the last decade.  
Now more than ever we can remind ourselves that "nothing lasts forever".  But if 
prohibition is to be reformed how will that come about?
<p>
<a href="#get">Top</a>
<p>
<a name="beg"></a>
<b>In the beginning...</b>
<p>
In order to achieve change, two things are necessary.  First, we need to know where we 
want to end up, and second, we need some idea of how we are to get there.  We can see in 
the GAO document enumerating alternative approaches and the monograph on legislative 
options for cannabis in Australia the first tentative steps towards spelling out contingency 
plans.  A few years ago, it would have been unthinkable that public officials could even 
consider such a thing as a contingency plan for alternatives to prohibition.
<p>
The process of developing alternative options for cannabis policy is already underway in 
Australia.  In September 1994, the Minister for Justice announced a study to estimate the 
costs and benefits of current policy and legislative options for cannabis in Australia.  This 
approach marks a watershed in our responses to illicit drugs.  National and international 
approaches have for decades been dominated by moralistic crusades about good versus 
evil.  How different is a framework of benefits versus costs!
<p>
A similar process could and almost certainly will ultimately apply for other currently 
illicit drugs.  Sooner or later, an individual or a committee will be asked to report on the 
costs and benefits of prohibition and alternative options for illicit drugs other than 
cannabis.  Options for drugs like heroin are more constrained because of our international 
treaty obligations.  We now have a model for dealing with the intricacies of transitions in 
the feasibility study conducted for the trial of controlled availability of heroin in the ACT. 
Options can be carefully examined, consultation undertaken and appropriate research 
designed and implemented.  This approach can be applied to other drugs when the 
community and its political leaders consider it necessary.
<p>
<a href="#get">Top</a>
<p>
<a name="win"></a>
<b>Winners and losers</b>
<p>
Policies that make the transition from proposals to legislation and regulation must be 
perceived as having more benefits than costs. There must be more perceived winners than 
losers.
<p>
In the United States, it is now clear that drug policy reform run across rather than 
between party lines.  Some ultra-conservatives support drug policy reform because they 
regard prohibition as contrary to the inexorable laws of sound economics.  Others support 
drug policy reform because they regard prohibition as an unwarranted attack on civil 
liberties.  On the left of US politics, drug policy reform is supported by those who argue 
that it is the disadvantaged and dispossessed who pay the heaviest price for prohibition. 
Their major argument for reform is social justice.  Support for prohibition is still very 
strong among ultra-conservatives who argue that a drug-free state is as American as apple 
pie.  Any attempt to tamper with prohibition, they say, is a direct attack on the flag, 
family and Constitution.  In the well-hallowed tradition of American extremism, they 
argue that in defence of prohibition, moderation is no virtue and extremism no vice.  
There are also strong supporters of prohibition on the American left who argue it is the 
disadvantaged and dispossessed minority groups who pay the heaviest price for the war 
on drugs because the US has never realty been serious about implementing prohibition.
<p>
In Australia, these divisions are not so readily apparent.  The Australian Parliamentary 
Drug Law Reform Group now has over 90 signatories, with members from the Australian 
Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the Australian Democrats and Independents. Membership 
includes a former Liberal prime minister, a former Liberal premier, two former Labor 
premiers and a number of senior former politicians.  Professor Peter Baume, a former 
senior Liberal Senator for New South Wales for 17 years, was an early signatory. Mr 
Kevin Rizzoli, a Liberal former Speaker of the New South Wales Lower House, is a 
signatory.  Drug policy reform at the moment draws more support from Labor politicians 
than other parties.  In Australia, it is unlikely that policy in such a sensitive area will ever 
gain the acceptance of the community unless strong political leadership is demonstrated 
and cross-party support is assured.
<p>
The Australian community is divided on prohibition.  As with community opinion polls 
on any subject, the results depend or who asks the questions.  Support for reform still 
falls short of majority but is clearly growing.  More than half the population supports 
major cannabis reform when the questions are asked in neutral way.  There is strong 
support for drug policy reform among the leaders of the medical profession, who prefer to 
see illicit drugs redefined as a health and welfare issue rather than remaining essentially a 
law enforcement concern.  The medical profession would also support change based on 
careful studies weighing up benefits and costs.
<p>
No senior Australian law enforcement official had so publicly expressed doubts about 
prohibition until Commissioner Johnson in 1995.  But many have been expressing similar 
sentiments in private for some time.  In the United Kingdom, senior law enforcement 
officials have been at the forefront of the prohibition debate.  Some police chiefs from 
major US cities have been outspoken since the early 1990s.  The Secretary-General of 
Interpol has also publicly questioned the viability of prohibition.  Prohibition is still 
strongly supported by junior police officers zealous about ridding the streets of the 
scourge of drug abuse.  It is only after they have attempted to do this for several years 
that they realise that every drug addict arrested in the streets is replaced almost 
immediately.  If they successfully cleanup street drugs in a neighborhood, prices rise and 
property crime increases.  As prices rise, corruption increases.  Many senior police now 
realise that while they cannot win enforcing prohibition, they cannot lose enforcing 
alcohol and tobacco legislation.  Achieving more responsible consumption of alcohol 
wins the police the commendation and respect they deserve from their difficult job.
<p>
Drug policy reform will never occur in Australia until there is more evidence of public 
support.  In the United States, it was the protests of ordinary men and women calling for 
an end to alcohol prohibition that sounded its death knell.  President Roosevelt convened 
the Wickersham Commission to investigate the costs and benefits of alcohol prohibition.  
The vast quantities of information they accumulated documenting the high price 
Americans were paying for prohibition helped to speed up repeal.  The Commission 
perversely ended up giving qualified support to prohibition.  But it was too late.  The 
American people had mobilised against prohibition and repeal became inevitable.
<p>
In 1995, a group called Families and Friends of Drug Addicts was formed in the ACT, 
drawn from relatives of heroin users who had died from a drug overdose.  Perhaps this is 
the beginnings of a grassroots campaign in Australia for reform of laws governing the 
major illicit drugs.  A grass roots campaicn for cannabis reform has been in existence for 
decades.
<p>
Within just a few years, bans on the growing of industrial hemp have been reversed in 
several States.  Supporters of industrial hemp point out that here is a crop which requires 
minimum water, no pesticides and which is friendly to the environment.  The industrial, 
commercial and economic advantages now seem all too obvious.  Prohibition of 
recreational cannabis has denied us the benefits of industrial hemp.  Similarly, we are 
unable to use cannabis to alleviate preventable health problems because it contravenes the 
prohibition of recreational cannabis.  Sooner or later, people will begin to ask why we can 
allow ourselves to benefit from industrial hemp and not benefit from medicinal cannabis.
<p>
<a href="#get">Top</a>
<p>
<a name="here"></a>
<b>Where to from here?</b>
<p>
The retort is often made that to each complex question there is always a simple answer 
and it is always wrong.  Yet this humorous obfuscation also denies the obvious.  At the 
heart of the argument lies a simple question: do you prefer your sons and daughters and 
fellow young Australians to obtain adulterated drugs of unknown concentration from the 
criminal underworld and disgraced ex-policemen, or clean drugs of known purity from a 
government clinic? Once that question is answered, other issues fall into place.
<p>
Almost two of every three young Australians have tried cannabis.  Do we prefer them to 
buy their supplies from criminals who may also try to sell them more dangerous drugs or 
do we dare to think, like the Dutch, of less harmful alternatives?  Sooner or later, we are 
led to the inescapable conclusion that the least harmful option is some form of regulated 
supply and production.
<p>
Our options for illicit drucs other than cannabis are more constrained because of our 
international treaty obligations.  But we can dispense drugs like heroin, amphetamines 
and cocaine to selected drug users through government-regulated clinics in just the same 
way that we prescribe methadone.  The United Kingdom is a signatory to the same 
international treaties as Australia and heroin and other drugs have been prescribed 
lawfully there since 1926.  Illicit drug users will need to apply to clinics and be assessed.  
They will need to demonstrate some evidence of using these drugs for a minimum period 
and complications.  This system will no doubt be messy, controversial and involve 
difficult clinical and ethical judgements.  However, the issue is not whether this is an 
ideal solution but whether we prefer decisions to be made by clinicians, as best they can, 
or by criminals.  We now have the very valuable experience of methadone programs to 
demonstrate that over time, contradictions can be dealt with and imperfections reduced to 
tolerable levels.  Some have queried the cost of expanded treatment.  Few question the 
cost of the present system.  In the United States, it was estimated that the cost of no 
treatment for a drug User for 12 months was $US43,000, while incarceration cost 
$US40,000, adult residential care $US16,500, methadone maintenance $US3500 and 
outpatient treatment $US3150.  The development of a large treatment system to dispense 
currently illicit drugs to drug-dependent users will not be cheap but it will be much less 
expensive than current policy.
<p>
Getting policies like this through the Australian political system will undoubtedly be a 
challenge.  Our experience with the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s provides a very useful 
model.  Cross party Parliamentary Liaison Groups in Commonwealth and State 
Parliaments helped to achieve change.  Political differences were sorted out in private so 
that policies emerged which saved many lives, many preventable cases of AIDS and 
ultimately, many hundreds of millions of dollars.  We could only benefit from following 
similar models for drug policy reform.  But we will also need a road map provided by 
people with sufficient technical expertise.
<p>
We have no choice but to live in a world of reality.  We have lived like other nations, 
emulating King Canute and pleading with the tides to not move up the sand.  Drug policy 
reform will help us become a more tolerant and compassionate country.  It wilt enhance 
our respect for civil liberties.  Reform will make illicit drug use less harmful, lessen 
crime, reduce the prison population, decrease police corruption and save scarce public 
resources.  Along the road, we will require some "courageous acts" from our political 
masters.  However, national and international experience shows us that support for drug 
policy reform need not be suicidal.  Senator Peter Baume remained the Senior Liberal 
Senator for 17 years despite his open and avowed support for free availability of illicit 
drugs. Michael Moore, a member of the ACT Legislative Assembly, has been re-elected 
twice on a platform which included drug policy reform.  We now have some 80 
Australian politicians openly advocating reform.  In the United States, Kurt Schmoke, the 
popular Mayor of Baltimore, has been an outspoken advocate of major drug policy 
reform for six years.  Yet he was offered a senior position in the Clinton Administration 
(which he declined).
<p>
Drug policy reform will really get going when politicians realise they have more to gain 
than lose by supporting change.  It is only a matter of time before an Australian political 
party concludes that its chances of capturing the youth vote will be increased by 
supporting cannabis reform.  The party which captures the youth vote is likely to retain 
some of these voters as they age.
<p>
Some might argue that prohibition has failed only because it has never been given a 
chance to work.  They say "send more troops, make one more push, victory is around the 
corner".  But:
<p>
<blockquote>If all the king's horses and all the king's men,<br>
Couldn't put Humpty together again ...</blockquote>
<p>
why would adding more horses and more men make any difference?  The history of US 
alcohol prohibition and off-course betting in Australia tells us there is no choice but to 
live in the world as it really is.
<p>
Drug policy is often spoken of as if it was a switch with three positions: status quo, 
decriminalisation and legalisation.  The truth is much more complicated.  Drug policy is 
in fact much more like a dimmer switch.  The previous chapter set out five major choices.  
Modifying the details of implementation of the policy within each major option will have 
a substantial impact on outcomes.  At the heart of the debate lies an assumption about 
trade-offs between the deterrent effect of enforcement and the numbers of people who are 
tempted to use currently illicit drugs.  Prohibition is based on a premise that increasing 
the harm for individuals strengthens the deterrent effect and reduces the number of 
consumers, thereby minimising problems for the community.  Reformers argue that to 
liberalise policies self-evidently reduces individual harm, and that taking the profit out of 
trafficking will cut the number of potential users, thereby benefiting individuals and the 
community.
<p>
There is overwhelming support in Australia and other countries for effective methods of 
reducing the number of people who wish to take illicit drugs.  So far, we have been 
unable to develop effective ways of decreasing the demand for currently illicit drugs.  
There is no reason why this search should not continue after drug policy has been 
liberalised.

Drug Prohibition:
A Call for Change</h3></center>
<p>
<a name="con"></a>
<center><b>CONCLUSION</b></center>
<p>
The conclusion of this book is relatively simple.  For almost 70 years in Australia we 
have banned cannabis.  For over 40 years we have banned heroin. When it seemed that 
this policy was not working well we devoted more resources to law enforcement and 
stiffened penalties.  When that did not work, we devoted even more resources to law 
enforcement and further increased penalties.  Now it is becoming clearer to more and 
more people that prohibition has not worked and never will.
<p>
Prohibition has failed to restrict the cultivation of drugs.  It has failed to restrict the 
production or refining of drugs. Only a small percentage of drugs transported from 
supplier to consumer country or within consumer countries are intercepted.  Prohibition is 
implemented in all countries in the world.  Yet availability of most drugs in most 
countries, including Australia, has increased alarmingly.  Drug-related deaths are 
increasing in many countries.  In Australia, deaths due to heroin have doubled in the last 
ten years and drug-related crime is increasing
<p>
Prohibition does not come cheap.  In 1989 the annual turnover of the cannabis industry in 
Australia was estimated to exceed $2.5 billion, while turnover for other illicit drugs was 
not far behind.  Little if any taxation is paid on that turnover.  Money spent enforcing 
prohibition is unavailable for schools, hospitals, the long-term unemployed, Aboriginal 
health, or enhancing Australia's export industries.
<p>
As if that were not enough, prohibition also creates a great deal of "collateral damage". 
Our civil liberties are eroded.  Prohibition breeds corruption; it helps to keep wealthy a 
criminal underworld and an international network of terrorists.
<p>
Prohibition was introduced for reasons which under closer examination now seem 
arbitrary.  Prohibition ignores the inexorable laws of economics.  One thing most people 
agree on is the fact that we will never get on top of an illicit drug industry that globally 
has a turnover of $US500 billion a year, including, about $US350 billion of profit.  We 
know that if the authorities stop drugs being grown in one part of the world, growers 
switch to another site.  If it becomes too difficult to grow drugs in one part of Australia, 
they will find somewhere else to hide in the seven and a half million square kilometres 
available.  If it is no longer safe to grow drugs in the open, cultivators shift them under 
the trees.  When that is no longer safe, they are shifted indoors.  When it is too dangerous 
to use large amounts of water and electricity to grow plants indoors, cultivators find ways 
around that too.  We know that traffickers will always be able to find a part of the world 
where there is enough poverty, political instability and good growing conditions.  The 
more the world improves conditions for legal trade, the more we also help the drug 
traffickers.  Every technological improvement which helps communication and makes 
industry and banking more efficient also makes it harder to track down drugs and the 
profits flowing from their illegal trade.
<p>
It is time we gave up making war on drugs and drug users, and instead made peace with 
people who use drugs.  We should try where we can to limit the damage that drugs do to 
people, and endeavour to keep drug users alive and well.  Sooner or later, most will give 
up drugs when they are ready.
<p>
Drug policy will develop by evolution, not revolution.  We must abandon the search for 
perfect solutions.  There are none.  In the first instance, we should try to eliminate 
criminal penalties on personal use of cannabis.  This will probably lead us to another 
stage where we regulate the sale of cannabis.  Ultimately, we can and must also regulate 
the production of cannabis; large scale unauthorised growing or sale of cannabis should 
be penalised, just as we penalise unauthorised large scale production or sale of other 
mood-altering substances such as alcohol.
<p>
The Canberra heroin trial at the Australian National University demonstrates how we 
should investigate managing other currently illicit drugs.  After the heroin trial, it may be 
worth investigating other drugs such as amphetamines.  Each drug should be handled on 
its merits.  We should research them one at a time.
<p>
At the end of the day, we face a choice.  One option is for people who are determined to 
use drugs whatever we may say or do, to obtain contaminated supplies of unknown 
concentration from criminals.  That is society's present preference.  A second option is for 
such people to have some kind of an assessment from health professionals.  If they fit 
certain criteria and all other measures have already failed to stop them harming 
themselves and others, we should consider permitting provision of sterile supplies of 
known concentration of currently illicit drugs in association with assistance and support.  
Some call this controlled availability.  This is the choice we prefer.
<p>
We believe that there is growing support among community members recognising the 
futility of current policies, to find more effective, less expensive and less 
counterproductive ways of dealing with this issue.  What we now need is to find a way of 
dealing with these long-term problems in a political system which rewards short-term 
benefits and tolerates long-term costs.  Obstacles to reform are crumbling, but the 
political perception that there are no votes in junkies remains.  There will be votes in 
junkies soon when a few more people start to realise how the current system maximises 
costs and minimises benefits.

<center><b>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</b></center>
<p>
<i>1.  Cigarettes and alcohol cause enough problems already; why do you want to allow 
dangerous drugs like heroin and cocaine to become freely available?</i>
<p>
First, we would rather government controlled the availability of drugs like heroin and 
cocaine than surrender control to criminals as at present.  Second, if governments 
controlled heroin and cocaine availability, associated deaths and crime would probably 
fall.  At present, health damage and crime from drugs like heroin are increasing, but 
deaths and diseases due to legal drugs like alcohol and tobacco are decreasing.  The 
system we advocate would make heroin and cocaine harder to get than they are now.
<p>
<i>2.  Legalising drugs like heroin means more drug use; more drug use means more 
problems.  That can be seen with alcohol and tobacco.  Surely that will also happen if you 
make drugs like heroin legal?</i>
<p>
First, if we take the profits out of the illegal drug market, the market will inevitably 
shrink.  Therefore, controlled availability will mean less not more drug use.  Second, 
legal drugs like alcohol and tobacco are quite toxic in themselves.  Therefore, the more 
they are consumed, the higher the death rate.  Deaths and diseases from drugs like heroin 
today are mainly caused by their illegality rather than their pharmacology.  Controlling 
their availability so that users can obtain clean supplies of known concentration means 
fewer overdose deaths, fewer infections and fewer deaths.  Third, Australia is committed 
to harm reduction.  Therefore, reducing drug-related deaths, diseases, crimes and other 
complications matters more than the quantity of drugs consumed.
<p>
<i>3.  How do you expect us to tell our kids drugs are bad if you make them legal - isn't 
that sending the wrong message?</i>
<p>
We are more successful influencing consumption of legal than illegal drugs because 
governments can influence the market.  Where we cannot limit consumption of currently 
illegal drugs, we must rely on limiting damage from their use.  Drug-related harm is the 
real enemy, not drug use per se.
<p>
<i>4.  Aren't all drug users and pushers merely criminals and prostitutes? </i>
<p>
No. Most people who use currently illicit drugs look conventional and are employed, 
stable and functional.  Some users alternate between functional and dysfunctional periods 
(during which they may be heavily involved in criminal activities and prostitution).  
Some people out of control on drugs in their twenties are firmly in control in their thirties.  
Finding ways for these people to minimise damage to themselves and others is what this 
debate is all about.
<p>
<i>5.  If you legalise heroin, won't more people use the drug?</i>
<p>
First, we are against legaliusation of drugs like heroin in the sense that they would 
become available uncontrolled over the counter.  Second, Australia is committed to 
reducing harm from drugs, not simply suppressing use.  How much harm occurs is more 
important in Australia than how many people are using a drug.  Third, prohibition 
increases the health, social and economic costs of drug use to deter users and potential 
users in the hope that this leads to less harm overall.  The controlled availability approach 
we support reduces the health, social and economic costs of drug use and the black 
market inevitably shrinks when its enormous profits are removed.  This will mean less 
harm from drug use and fewer users as well.  Fourth, there has been no detectable 
increase in cannabis use in the dozen jurisdictions around the world which liberalised 
policies on cannabis.  Many reported substantial savings on cannabis law enforcement.
<p>
<i>6.  If you start by decriminalising marijuana, won't that just be the thin edge of the 
wedge - a gateway to harder drugs?</i>
<p>
First, we support the maintenance of strict controls on the marijuana market after reform.  
We should not repeat the mistakes of the tobacco era and allow cannabis to be produced 
and marketed with hardly any regulations.  Second, there is no valid evidence to show 
that use of marijuana leads to so-called harder drugs like heroin or cocaine.
<p>
<i>7.  Cannabis causes lung cancer - like cigarettes - and mental illness, and is a much 
more dangerous drug than people admit.  Isn't it logical, then, to ban it?</i>
<p>
However dangerous cannabis really is, and most authorities now believe that it causes 
relatively few health problems, the real question is which policy minimises the costs.  
Current policy is expensive, probably results in some potential cannabis consumers 
switching to far more dangerous injectable drugs like amphetamines, gives many users a 
criminal record and makes it difficult to encourage cannabis smokers to use filters, to a 
void cannabis if they have a history of mental illness and to avoid driving for several 
hours after smoking.
<p>
<i>8.  Heroin is a really dangerous drug.  Why make it available for anyone to use it?</i>
<p>
Heroin is not a particularly dangerous drug if the concentration is known and it is used 
under medical supervision.  Deaths from heroin these days are mainly caused by 
depressed breathing leading to an overdose.  This happens often at present because drug 
users do not know the strength of street heroin.  The most common side effect of heroin 
used under medical supervision is constipation.
<p>
<i>9.  What's next - are you also going to give out cocaine, amphetamines and any other 
drug that comes along?</i>
<p>
Under prohibition, the drug market is inherently unstable as new traffickers try to gain a 
niche by selling new drugs.  Also, under prohibition more dangerous drugs (like 
amphetamines) drive out less dangerous drugs (like cannabis) because the less dangerous 
drugs are bulkier and easier to detect.  The more concentrated the drug, the likelier there 
will be side-effects.  Prohibition in Asia drove out opium smoking which was replaced by 
heroin injecting.  Under controlled availability, safer drugs would drive out more 
dangerous drugs.  It would be logical to provide stimulant drugs (to those with a long 
history of using them already) in a form which was less dangerous than that already in the 
marketplace.  But this would need to be tried out in research projects similar to the 
proposed Canberra heroin trial.
<p>
<i>10.  If prohibition doesn't seem to work, isn't that because we have not been tough 
enough for long enough?</i>
<p>
Heroin has been totally prohibited in Australia since 1953 and cannabis since 1926.  If 
prohibition worked, we should know by now.  If spending a quarter of a billion dollars a 
year on illicit drug law enforcement is not enouch, how much do we need to spend?  Half 
a billion?  Three quarters?  One billion?  If 8000 prisoners serving drug-related offences 
in Australia at any time is not enough to make prohibition work, do we need 12,000, 
16,000 or 20,000 to make prohibition work?  Or do we look to the United States for 
answers?  The United States spends about 60 billion dollars a year on illicit drug law 
enforcement and has more prisoners per head of population than any other western 
country.  Despite lavish funding and severe penalties, they still have much higher levels 
of drug use and drug problems than any other western country.
<p>
<i>11.  How would your system cope with people who have only started to use 
drugs?</i>
<p>
Our system is aimed at the heavy user because we want to minimise harm and most harm 
is associated with heavy users.  In the system we propose, recreational drug users would 
still buy drugs from a black market.  This is not ideal but overall the system would still be 
better than what we have at present.
<p>
<I>12.  No country has legalised drugs.  Why should we start?</i>
<p>
Four countries have provided currently illicit drugs to drug users under controlled 
conditions.  First, in the United States clinics in 44 cities dispensed injectable morphine 
to selected patients from 1919 to 1923.  The project was stopped because it was 
considered inconsistent with the newly introduced prohibition of alcohol.  Second, the 
United Kingdom has allowed doctors to prescribe drugs (including injectable heroin) to 
selected heroin users where other methods have failed to help them "lead a normal and 
useful life".  This system has only been implemented on a small scale with minimal 
evaluation.  Injectable heroin was compared with oral methadone in one study and found 
to be as effective overall.  Many patients in the United Kingdom also receive injectable 
methadone.  This has never been evaluated.  Third, Italy had a large injectable morphine 
program in the 1980s which was as effective as the oral methadone program.  Fourth, a 
small research project in the Netherlands in the 1980s found that provision of injectable 
drugs to a few heroin users with very serious mental problems was ineffective.  
Switzerland started a heroin trial in 1993 with almost 1000 patients.  Early results showed 
that dispensing heroin is feasible and produces quick improvements in many, but the 
Study also shows that the heroin-dependent drug users are so severely damaged in so 
many aspects of their living, that considerable help will be needed for some time to come.  
The Netherlands has decided to start a heroin trial.  A heroin trial has been under 
consideration in Canberra since 1991.  A small number of patients have been maintained 
on injectable methadone in Queensland for about 15 years.
<p>
<I>13.  The community will never support legalising drugs - any politician or party 
advocating legalisation will be committing suicide.</i>
<p>
In 1989, 38 per cent of Australians in a Saulwick poll supported the decriminalisation of 
personal quantities of heroin to stem the spread of HIV among injecting drug users.  In 
1994, 50 per cent supported legalisation and 75 per cent supported decriminalisation of 
cannabis.  The Australian Democrats were the first Australian political party to support 
drug policy reform.  Young Liberals and Young Labor both support reform.  Professor 
Peter Baume, a senior Liberal Senator for NSW for 17 years, made no secret of his 
support for radical drug policy reform and still became a Federal Minister.  The former 
Liberal Speaker of the NSW Lower House, Mr Kevin Rizzoli, has not been damaged 
politically by supporting reform.  Over 90 members of Australian parliaments have now 
signed the Australian Parliamentary Drucg Law Reform Charter.  All we are waiting for 
now is leadership.
<p>
<I>14.  You'll never be able to run any kind of system where drugs are given to drug 
addicts.  How will you stop them trying to increase their dose or stop heroin from getting 
to under-age kids?</i>
<p>
First, we have faced exactly these sorts of problems for over 25 years in methadone 
maintenance programs in Australia and are able to manage quite easily.  Second, heroin 
users on the streets or patients on our methadone proaram do not keep on requiring more 
and more heroin so why should heroin users on a controlled availability program?  Third, 
what stops under-age children getting street heroin today?
<p>
<I>15.  They tried giving drugs to addicts in England which didn't work and they 
legalised drugs in Holland where it was a disaster.  Why try it here?</i>
<p>
Prescribing heroin, amphetamines and cocaine in England over more than 60 years has 
only been undertaken by a few doctors with a small number of patients.  As very little 
research was done, it is hard to evaluate the effectiveness of their approach.  The 
Netherlands has never legalised drugs.  Cannabis is available from carefully supervised 
coffee shops.  The Netherlands still has the same drug laws as most western countries.  
Drug users found with personal quantities of illicit drugs are rarely prosecuted.  
Traffickers are prosecuted as in other countries.  Despite claims to the contrary, drug 
problems and drug use are less in the Netherlands than most other European countries.
<p>
<I>16.  If you legalise druag, the pushers will simply turn to other kinds of crime and we 
will be no better off.</i>
<p>
When the United States repealed prohibition in 1933, about a quarter of the criminals 
continued involvement in bootleg liquor, a quarter turned to other crimes, a quarter turned 
to the now legal alcohol trade while the remaining quarter moved to new legal activities 
altogether.  This might be a guide to how things will turn out when we reform drug policy 
in Australia.
<p>
<i>17. Prison is the only thing that will make most drug users give up drugs.  Doesn't 
prison stop them harming themselves and their communities?</i>
<p>
About half the drug-using prisoners stop using drugs when they go to prison.  All but a 
few start as soon as they are released.  Prisons are very damaging psychologically.  Many 
learn in prison for the first time how to crack safes and commtt crimes undetected. 
Prisons are expensive.  Medium security costs $123 per prisoner per day in NSW.
<p>
<i>18. Do you seriously believe that we can do away with law enforcement for drugs 
altogether?</i>
<p>
We will never do away with law enforcement for currently illegal drugs.  The police (and 
customs) play an important role in regulating legal drugs.  Someone trying to smuggle a 
suitcase full of whisky through customs risks penalties today.  It will be the same with 
currently illegal drugs after drug policy reform.
<p>
<i>19. Don't we need to keep prohibition to deal with people who drive when they are 
stoned on cannabis or other drugs?</i>
<p>
This is a problem now under prohibition and will continue to be a problem after drug 
policy reform.  We need an objective measure of cannabis intoxication for drivers under 
prohibition or reform.  Cannabis-intoxicated drivers should be detected and punished 
whether we have prohibition or reform.
<p>
<i>20. Switzerland tried to legalise drugs with their infamous "needle-park" experiment 
which failed and had to be stopped. Why should we try?</i>
<p>
Switzerland did not try to legalise drugs in Needle Park.  They allowed an open drug 
scene to develop while trying to provide an environment where drug users could get 
health and social services.  There is now general recognition that open drug scenes do not 
work under prohibition.  The Swiss government-controlled "fixing rooms" have been a 
success and are now being tried in other countries.

<b>A Study of Active Drug Users</b>
<p>
This dissertation brings together results of my NWO*-funded ethnography --into the drug 
taking rituals of regular users of heroin, cocaine and other psychoactive substances--, 
resulting studies and some twenty years of puzzlement and subsequent pondering. The NWO 
study was initiated in the former Erasmus University Institute for Preventive and Social 
Psychiatry (IPSP) by professor Charles D. Kaplan and the late institute director professor 
Kees Trimbos. The work was completed within the walls of the new-born Instituut voor 
Verslavingsonderzoek (IVO), Addiction Research Institute, and the safety of my home. 
<p>
The assumed failure of users of illicit drugs to conform with common standards of socially 
appropriate conduct is directly associated with the use of a substance which supposedly 
renders them powerless. This image is not only part of popular wisdom, but, in different 
forms also recognized in several scientific theories.1 Many theories emphasize the powerful 
pharmacological properties of psychoactive drugs. others relate (problematic) substance use 
to f.e. deficient personality structures, ego problems, impaired psychological development, 
acute distress or psychiatric problems. Again other theories associate drug use with 
environmental deficits, such as poverty. All of these factors may, indeed, explain part of the 
phenomenon, but the frequent emphasis on only one aspect, be it a pharmacological, 
psychological or social factor, is in my opinion erroneous. Until now, none of these schools 
has produced specific correlations between cause and effect (2, 3, 4).  A number of recent 
studies have questioned these (rather) mono-causal explanations and emphasized the multi-
dimensionality of drug taking behaviors (5).
<p>
My personal position in this matter results from a strong interest in the phenomenon of drug 
use per se. While most theories regarding substance use are based on captive, in particular 
clinical samples of problematic users, I think that, if we are to get to the bottom of it, we must 
study the phenomenon primarily in its natural arena. Thus, carefully observe individuals 
when they do what they do, where, with whom and why they do it, without the blinders of 
preconceived notions. To do so, the researcher must enter the community under study, largely 
similar to the classical cultural anthropologist who studies a traditional society (6). The 
resulting analysis must be grounded in the study subjects' experience and perception of their 
environment (7).
<p>
The basic material of this thesis is presented by an ethnographic study of regular users of 
heroin and cocaine in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Relying largely on participant observation, 
this study describes patterns of use, their functions, meanings and determinants. A crucial 
aspect of this study has been the employment of a community fieldworker, a respected 
community member who played a decisive role in establishing a research alliance between 
the traditionally separated worlds of research and drug use. The other studies address specific 
aspects of the observed behaviors, for example the impact of policy, their health 
consequences and --how could it not-- their relationship with that cryptic little time bomb, the 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus; perpetrator of the post-modern plague, Acquired Immune 
Deficiency Syndrome. 
<p>
An explicit assumption of this study has been that the observed behaviors serve both 
instrumental and symbolic goals, and that these are not fundamentally different from those of 
other human beings. To operationalize these complementary perspectives, the concept of 
ritualization has been utilized. Ritualization is thus the common denominator of the studies 
presented in this dissertation. Ritual is a basic interaction unit of culture. Studying 
ritualization processes reveals essential information on the determinants and consequences of 
the behaviors and believes intrinsic to a culture. The main goal of this research has been to 
discover the functions and meanings of (ritualized) drug related behaviors. The most 
important finding is that these (social) behaviors provide the infrastructure for self-regulation 
processes controlling drug use. Based on the presented material and recently accumulated 
literature, I propose a model of self-regulation in intoxicant use which challenges many of the 
currently fashionable theories on substance (ab)use.

This dissertation is presented in three parts. part I (chapters 1-9) introduces the NWO study 
and presents the ethnographic analysis of the observed drug taking rituals. Chapter two will 
introduce the notion of ritualization, discuss its utilizations in studies of drug use behaviors 
and investigate conditions of ritualization. Chapter three presents the research questions and 
discusses the terms and definitions used in this thesis. Ensuing it introduces the participant 
observation study, and describes some characteristics of the study participants. Chapter four 
to six will present extensive descriptive analyses of the ritual behaviors observed in this 
research (research questions 1.1, 1.2 and 1.6). In chapters seven to nine this analysis is 
deepened, centering around both the instrumental and symbolic functions of the drug related 
ritualized behaviors (research questions 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7)
<p>
Part II (chapters 10-16) presents studies focussing on the health consequences of the drug 
administration rituals, featuring HIV and their relationships with drug- and health policy. 
Chapter ten will compare the health consequences of injecting and chasing (research question 
2.1). Chapter eleven is an in depth analysis of drug sharing among IDUs and its risk potential 
for the spread of HIV (research question 2.2). Chapter twelve analyzes the cases of unsafe 
injecting behavior observed in this study (research question 2.3) and chapter thirteen will 
discuss the question of whether or not needle sharing can be considered a ritualized 
interaction (research question 2.4). Chapter fourteen presents an example of a cooperation 
model of outreach work and active drug injectors in distributing needles to hidden 
populations of IDUs, that is in line with the findings of this study (research question 3.2). 
Chapter fifteen and sixteen consider the influence of drug policy factors (research question 
3.1). Chapter fifteen examines the cocaine smoking rituals found at two different research 
sites and chapter sixteen compares the drug use contexts of Rotterdam and the Bronx, New 
York, and the HIV implications of the different drug policies found in both locales. 
<p>
Drawing on the preceding studies, part III of this dissertation consists of two chapters on the 
determinants of drug use management and self-regulation, on an individual, as well as on a 
cultural level. Chapter seventeen will present and discuss the model of drug use self-
regulation (research questions 1.7, 1.8 and 1.9), while chapter eighteen puts this model in a 
cultural context and addresses the relationships between drug cultures and drug policy. This 
final chapter will further present recommendations for future development of research, policy 
and practice in the areas of drug use and HIV (research questions 1.8, 1.9, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3). 
<p>
Some of the presented studies have been published as separate articles. Where this is the case 
this is reported at the opening of the chapter. As a result, some overlap between the chapters 
has been inevitable. 
<p>
Before introducing the concept of ritualization, the remainder of this chapter will present a 
brief overview of the history of illicit drug use in the Netherlands after 1960.

<b>Illicit Drug Use in The Netherlands: A Birds-Eye View</b>
<p>
<i>Initial Experiments</i>
<p>
The first signs of illicit drug use in The Netherlands could be observed in the beginning of the 
1960s. Cannabis was the drug, and its incidence was rising fast. At the end of the 1960s "stuf" 
(hashish) and "wiet" (marihuana) were followed by LSD and the like. Then, through literature 
and pharmaceutical handbooks, young white males, mostly, discovered opium, opium 
derivatives, cocaine and the amphetamines. Cocaine was not readily available, and expensive. 
Opium became available to these experimenters when they discovered the Netherlands' 
Chinese community. These Chinese opium sellers knew from ongoing experience and 
tradition, what the Dutch (and the British) remembered only vaguely from repressed 
memories of their recent history (8) --opiates are merchandise-- and they were willing to sell. 
Amphetamines could be obtained via at least two channels --illegally processed or from 
medical sources, on prescription for weight worries, depression and fatigue (9). Many sincere 
experimenters used the Pharmaceutical Desk Reference's descriptions of symptoms as a 
textbook and they were serious scholars.
<p>
<i>Heroin</i>
<p>
Around 1971/1972 heroin became widely available in the Netherlands. The remaining 
experimenters and more dedicated multiple drug users, in particular those injecting opiates or 
amphetamines, were the first groups to experience heroin. The intensity of the first 
experiments with heroin initially suppressed and masked additional drug use among these 
users.* As a result, with the introduction of heroin, the phenomenon of drug use was redefined 
from "drug problem" to "heroin problem," and moved into a new and highly turbulent phase. 
From that moment on, heroin and its initial users went their own way. Soon (1972 - 1975) 
they were joined by a completely new user group with an entirely different socio-
demographic and cultural background and little drug experience --the Surinamese. Shortly 
after, a significant number of South Moluccan users followed, and around 1975, after heroin 
entered mainstream discotheques, another group --blue collar white Dutch adolescents-- 
appeared on the scene. This group, which previously had limited their drug use to tobacco 
and alcoholic beverages, progressed very fast from cannabis to heroin. At the end of the 
1970s a second generation of young adolescents with similar socio-economic characteristics 
followed. Somewhat simultaneously, second generation immigrants, in particular Moroccans, 
became involved in heroin use (10, 11).  Awareness of heroin use in this group came about in 
the early 1980s (12, 13).  Around 1985, the group became a political priority and by 1986 the 
first research on this group was published (14, 15). Indeed, the Moroccans were getting more 
and more involved in heroin. Turkish users, at the time however, were unusual (15).
<p>
Since the middle of the 1980s, the number of heroin users  seems to be stabilizing: between 
20.000 and 30.000 (16, 17). There is little reliable data on the ethnic distribution of the total 
group. Methadone intake data from Rotterdam (RODIS) shows that 2058 individuals were 
registered in 1989 (73% __ and 27% __) with a mean age of 30.1: an increase of 0.8 year in 
comparison to 1988. 64% were native Dutch, 17% Surinamese and Dutch Antilleans, 5% 
Moroccans, 1% Turks and 13% came from other countries or were unknown (18). Although 
there is some definite growth among North Africans, the methadone using population in 
Rotterdam at large seems to be stable. Comparable 1990 data from the Centralized 
Methadone Registration in Amsterdam shows that methadone was dispensed to 4805 
individuals (74% __ and 26% __) with a mean age of 32.5. 40.2% were native Dutch, 16.8% 
Surinamese and Dutch Antilleans, 3.6% Moroccans, 0.8% Turks, 11.3% Germans, 5.8% 
Italians and 21.6% came from other countries or were unknown (19). As in Rotterdam, the 
methadone using population is rather stable and aging, but is more than two years older than 
the Rotterdam population. The ethnic distributions in the two cities are rather similar. 
<p>
<i>Cocaine</i>
<p>
The early 1980s was also the period in which cocaine made its way up; into post modern 
entertainment and the ranks of the young urban unemployed and their working counterparts. 
In these groups, use of cocaine, seemingly, has not lead to massive problems (20). But, 
almost simultaneously cocaine has also taken the stairs down. Already in 1981, heroin and 
cocaine were sold together on the Zeedijk in Amsterdam. In the following chapters it will be 
shown that smoking is the dominant administration ritual for both heroin and cocaine in this 
group of heavy users. Cocaine is smoked in a self prepared base form, similar to crack. 
However, in recent publications, Engelsman writes "crack use is a rarity" and "Crack has still 
not reached The Netherlands"(16, 21). Such discrepancies underline the importance of 
ethnographic research for drug policy making. 
<p>
<i>Psychedelica Revisited</i>
<p>
Finally, in 1987 MDMA (XTC or Ecstasy) use emerged, predominantly in the House music 
scene, and reached both new users with minimal or no experience with other illegal drugs, 
and users with a varied experience of other illegal drugs. Related substances such as 
amphetamine, LSD and psilocybin may also have gained some popularity (22, 23, 24). In the 
concluding chapter this phenomenon will be further investigated.

<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
<blockquote>"Ritual events required a period of preparation, lengthy fasting and sexual 
abstinence, scalding steam baths, and blood penance. Ritual books were consulted, the 
propitious calendrical co-ordinates plotted, positions of the moon, planets, especially the baleful 
Venus were noted. Extended chanting, recitations of past experiences by initiates, careful 
attention to the refinements of dress, adjustments of masks, rehearsing of dance movements and 
recitations practiced. Finally the numbing rhythms of percussion orchestras, drums rattles, 
scraped turtle carapaces, pierced by whistles and conch trumpets. Preliminary animal sacrifices 
and the burning of clouds of copal incense; lengthy preparations needed to condition the shaman 
and ready his psychological and physical state for the ordeal to come" (1).</blockquote>
<p>
This example of an elaborated religious ritual will probably meet with many people's 
depiction of ritual. It has all the exotic elements of popular representations in magazines, 
movies and television, of ritual in, so-called, primitive culture. And indeed, it contains some 
of the key features of ritual. It presents an extraordinary event, that requires thorough 
preparation, rehearsal, distinctive materials and symbols. It also gives a sense of show or play 
--Lights, Camera: Action! Theatrical as this event may seem, it is more than just a well 
directed performance of a group of actors. Rather, the performance has intrinsic value to its 
players. "Rituals are highly meaningful, rationalized by a system of beliefs" (2). The ritual is 
meant to bring about a state of consciousness, different from the ordinary, that enables its 
performers to accomplish a task that is outside the realm of everyday routine, and for that 
reason requires an altered physical and/or psychological state of being. 
<p>
However, rituals are not always so elaborated, extravagant or recognizable, so obviously set 
aside from day-to-day practice. In much simpler forms rituals can be observed in everyday 
life (3). Lighting a cigarette when entering an unfamiliar social setting or simple greeting 
behaviors are common forms of ritual. Greeting rituals, for example, can differ significantly 
between and within cultures. Shaking hands, bending the head, a kiss on the cheek, or kissing 
the hand can all be appropriate in one culture, but out of touch or even insulting in another. 
Such differences can be very subtle; just touching cheeks or an actual kiss on the cheeks; one 
kiss or three. Within the same culture, by the same person some others are greeted by a nod or 
a hand, some by a superficial kiss and some by an ardent embrace. Given the same individual 
and the same other the appropriate ritual can even vary according to the situation, mood, or 
the outcome of a former encounter. Such greeting behaviors seem to have three functions: 
they facilitate "the opening of a channel for communication and interaction; the[y] defin[e] 
role and status; and they are acting as a means of manipulating relationships to secure a 
specific result" (4). The behavioral sequence of smoking the first cigarette after waking up, 
the first cup of coffee and the subsequent visit to the bath room can be a ritual. A former 
colleague once explained, that in the morning he needed to drink, at least, four cups of coffee 
before getting started, otherwise he could not function throughout the day (5). Was this 
because of a chemical dependency on caffeine or did the process surrounding the actual 
administration of that drug, e.g. the thoughts anticipating the day to come while sipping the 
coffee, also play a role? Ritual is a prosaic phenomenon in human life.
<p>
Ritual is commonly referred to in social scientific discourse and in lay conversation. What is 
actually meant by ritual is however often taken for granted; it is not made explicit. In casual 
chat this can lead to minor confusion. In the realm of science such omission can result in 
more serious consequences. In many elaborated theories on drug use, terms and concepts 
often stay ill defined (6). At times resulting in poorly or ungrounded statements about drug 
abusers, addicts and junkies, their behaviors, and, in the context of the AIDS era, their 
abilities for behavior change. 
<p>
This thesis deals with drug taking rituals. Therefore, this chapter explores the concept of 
ritual --what constitutes a ritual and what are the functions, meanings and values for 
participants?-- and its application to studies of drug use. 
<p>
<a href="#rit">Top</a>

<b>The Concept of Ritual in the Social Sciences</b>
<p>
<i>The Behavioral Sequence of Ritual</i>
<p>
The term ritual refers to behavior. However, not all behavior --"the total response, motor and 
glandular, which an organism makes to any situation with which it is faced" (7) -- is ritual 
behavior. Ritual addresses a unique class of observable behavior. The notion is reserved for a 
specific behavioral sequence of acts and signals which, "allows no uncertainty, no choice" 
(2). Consequently, ritual is fixed. Turning to the anthropological and sociological literature 
for a useful definition of ritual one finds formulations that have certain components in 
common, and at the same time, diverge significantly. "A definition of ritual such as might be 
applicable to the term in all its acceptations is difficult, ... not because the term is widely 
used, but because it is not possible to determine the true nature of what constitutes the 
irreducible basis of the myriad human practices it represents" (8).
<p>
Durkheim calls ritual "determined modes of action" (9). According to Wallace, "ritual may be 
defined as stereotyped communication, solitary and interpersonal" (2). To Goody ritual refers 
to "a category of standardized behavior (custom) in which the relationship between the means 
and the end is not intrinsic; i.e. is either irrational or non rational" (10). Carter states that a 
ritual "must involve repetitive action, be kept in limited contexts, reflect basically uncritical 
acceptance of some value, quality, attitude, or belief, and in some way convey to the 
individuals hope that he will be helped in coping with his situation and in facing life with 
renewed vigour and confidence" (11). For Partridge "the defining feature of ritual is that of a 
repetitive, reassertive form. Ritual as an ordered statement of pattern against randomness, 
order against idiosyncrasy" (12). Nadel defines rituals as "actions exhibiting striking or 
incongruous rigidity, that is, some conspicuous regularity not accounted for by the professed 
aims of actions" (13). Turner specifies the features that are involved in such stereotyped 
behavior chains: "gestures, words, objects" and limits the place of performance; this should 
be a special "sequestered" place (14). All these definitions have in common the requirement 
of a fixed and predictable behavioral sequence distinguished from activities without fixed 
order and with unsure outcome, such as driving a bicycle or car. Thus, ritual behavior is 
stereotypical behavior; the course and outcome of the behavioral sequence are rather fixed 
and predictable. 
<p>
<i>Special Meaning</i>
<p>
The standardized sequence is a necessary but not a sufficient criterium as can be seen in some 
of the above definitions. If so, actions such as sorting mail in a post office, work on an 
assembly line and other forms of equally stereotyped technical acts would also qualify. In 
such acts the meaning is uni-dimensional. In ritual, the act has meaning beyond its 
performance. Ritual is thus symbolic action, "a representation of reality at a certain level of 
reference by a corresponding reality at another" (8).
<p>
Sacred versus Secular
<p>
The concept of ritual has often been examined in the framework of studies of religious 
behavior. For this reason, the discussion has often centered around the sacred properties of 
rituals --Ritual as a medium between men and their Supreme Being(s). This orthodox 
approach reserves the term ritual for magical and religious behavior and stems from Emile 
Durkheim's distinction between the sacred and the profane. "Religious phenomena are 
naturally arranged in two fundamental categories: Beliefs and rites. Beliefs are states of 
opinion and consist in representations. Rites are determined modes of action. Between the 
two classes of facts there is all the difference which separates thought from action." "The rites 
can be defined and distinguished from other human practices, moral practices, for example, 
only by the special nature of their object" (9). Rituals address a different class of objects --the 
sacred. As Malinowski puts it: "Every culture can be divided into two distinguishable 
domains: the domain of magic and religion and the domain of science; the sacred and the 
profane. Ritual belongs to the sacred domain and is ipso facto an action grounded in faith 
rather that in reason" (15).
<p>
However, such rigid opinions have been criticized, because "the values that prompt and 
sanction the performance of ritual are also, generally speaking, the same values that motivate 
people in their daily lives" (2). Ritual actions can then be seen as displays of the cultural 
values, as part of a non-verbal system of communication (16). Moreover, the erosion of the 
power of traditional religious institutions has (at least in parts of the western world) led to a 
substantial decrease in importance of the sacred (11). Then "the popular distinction between 
the sacred and the profane does not seem to be a sound basis for distinguishing rituals from 
ordinary day-to-day practices. It is in fact the ritual touch which makes certain practices 
sacred, not that an act becomes ritual because it happens to possess a sacred character" (8). 
When sacred becomes more-or-less disconnected from its religious context and is merged 
with a more general notion of special meaning, then "any type of behavior may be said to turn 
into a ritual when it is stylized or formalized and made repetitive in that form" (13). Many 
authors who started with the idea that social actions either belong to the sacred or the profane, 
concluded that this distinction is, in fact, not realistic. In the words of Edmund Leach: "[I]t is 
a scholastic illusion to suppose that human actions are everywhere ordered to accord with 
such discriminations" (17). Thus, "ritual refers to all symbolic behavior and is not to be 
confined to actions associated with religious institutions"(16). As a result, Goody's 
requirement that "the relationship between means and end is not intrinsic" seems a more 
modern interpretation which may be derived from this loss of importance of the sacred. 
<p>
Instrumental versus Symbolic
<p>
According to Radcliffe-Brown, ritual acts stand in direct contrast to technical acts. "In 
technical activity an adequate statement of the purpose of any particular act or series of acts 
constitutes by itself a sufficient explanation. But ritual acts differ from technical acts in 
having in all instances some expressive or symbolic element in them" (18). Consequently, 
ritual activity is always in pursuit of ritual value with the exclusion of direct purposiveness. 
In this perspective, ritual action cannot be put in a means-end scheme. It is not a means to an 
end, but an end in itself (9, 15).  But in many ritual practices it is not always easy to 
distinguish between instrumental and symbolic action (especially in drug use rituals) "There 
is a continuum of action stretching from the purely technical to the purely symbolic. While 
the poles are clearly defined there are points between them that are difficult to place in either 
category" (19). Moreover, "in spite of its essentially non purposive character, [ritual] can 
always be transformed into purposive action. Use of ritual procedure for the fulfillment of 
practical needs of life is a common feature of all organized religions" (8). It is thus hard to 
differentiate between technical purposiveness and ritual symbolism in stereotyped behavior. 
For La Fontaine it is a question of proportion. "A preponderance of symbolic over technical 
action (however technical the actors may consider the purpose of the rite) is what marks of 
ritual from the customary performance of technical acts" (19).
<p>
Here one also gets confronted with a possible discrepancy between explanations given by the 
participants of rituals and those of the observer/analyst. Both Malinowski and Radcliffe-
Brown attach little importance to the actors' notions of meaning and functions of the rituals 
they perform. In their opinion actors (natives) are unable to give correct explanations as they 
have no comprehension of its real caliber, it is thus the responsibility of the analyst to do so 
(15, 18). However, in the context of contemporary studies of urban drug use in modern 
society, such a view point insults the ability of the actors who often have elaborate 
explanations for their activities (20). Moreover, the distinctions between the already hard to 
classify phenomena technical and symbolic may even be relative or arbitrary (19).
<p>
At this point, it can be asserted that ritual seems to refer to stylized behavioral sequences with 
fixed pattern and outcome, in which the symbolic meaning (not necessarily religious) has a 
preponderance over its technical purposiveness.
<p>
<i>Formal Rituals versus Natural Rituals</i>
<p>
Up to this point the discussion has been mainly concerned with so-called formal rituals. This 
section will review some different types of formal rituals, and so-called natural rituals and 
demonstrate that the distinctions between the two are more gradual than absolute. 
<p>
Formal Rituals
<p>
A common distinction of formal rituals is that between calendrical rituals --those that occur 
on a regular schedule in some natural cycle (seasons, position of moon, planets, and stars, 
eclipses, etc.)-- and non-calendrical or critical rituals, which do not follow such cycles but are 
performed on occasions of crisis. Some rituals, such as rites of passage follow a life-cycle (2). 
Another distinction is based on the intended purpose of the rituals:
<p>
<blockquote>Rites of passage, such as initiation rites and ceremonies surrounding marriage, 
childbirth and death. "Rites de passage are rites which accompany every change of place, 
state, social position and age" (21). A rite of passage has three stages --separation, transition, 
and incorporation. In the first stage the individual is taken out of his or her familiar context. 
In the second, the individual is exposed to ritual actions meant to effect the intended 
transformation. In this phase the individual is sacred. Finally, the new status is formally 
established. In marriage, the bachelor party, wedding shower and separate preparations 
(dressing) on the marriage day are all examples of separation. The actual religious or civil 
ceremony and the wedding night signify the transition. The reception, party, the 
consequences of marriage like moving to a new house, the adoption of the man's name and, in 
some traditional communities, hanging the sheet of the marital night from the window, 
proving the breaking of the maidenhead, are incorporating activities, naturally following 
stage two. However, note that the demarcation between stages two and three is somewhat 
blurry as the reception and party normally precedes the wedding night.
<p>
Rites of intensification, including hunting and agricultural rites that aim at intensification of 
the fertility of crops and availability of game. These are, in contrast with rites of passage, 
group-centered (22).</blockquote>
<p>
However, not all rituals fit this scheme so neatly. Wallace proposes a "less abstract 
classification of the transformations intended by religious rituals, closer to the consciously 
stated purposes of the actors". He distinguishes five categories: (2)
<p>
<blockquote>Ritual as technology, intended to control various aspects of nature, other than 
man himself, for the purpose of human exploitation. This category includes divination, aimed 
at extracting useful information from nature when the actor(s) feel(s) a lack of information to 
base a decision on, such as dowsing or flipping a coin; The already mentioned hunting and 
agricultural rites of intensification, aimed at the mobilization, focussing and intensification of 
natural periodical processes; Protective rituals, that intend to prevent or avoid a diversity of 
ills and disasters, such as broken tools, fires, floods, plagues, etc., exemplified in blessing a 
ship or tool. They have in common that they are all pragmatic and are aimed at manipulating 
the environment into more favorable states.
<p>
Ritual as therapy and anti-therapy, aimed at controlling human health, especially in cases 
where the cause of disease or disorder are difficult to discover, such as infectious diseases, 
allergies, psychological complaints, etc. In these cases supernatural interference is often 
suspected. Witchcraft (anti-therapy) may be involved. Therapeutic rituals may be performed 
by laymen in case of minor problems. In more serious conditions a professional shaman will 
be necessary.
<p>
Ritual as social control or ideological rituals. These are intended to control, in a conservative 
way, the behavior, the mood, the sentiments and values of groups for the sake of the 
community as a whole. They intend to instruct, to direct, and to program individuals into 
accepted statuses, as they enter upon new tasks or situations. Examples are rites of passage, 
social rites of intensification (the sabbath, the mass, political party meetings) and (religious) 
taboos (e.g. on sexual intercourse between kinfolk or during menstruation) and courtesies 
(saluting, men holding the door for women).
<p>
Ritual as salvation from a state in which the identity is seriously impaired by social abuse or 
by an internal disillusionment. In such religious identity renewal the identification is with, or 
the differentiation is from, a supernatural being. Most cultures recognize at least some such 
identity problems in individuals, and provide culturally standardized ways for the unfortunate 
victim of identity conflict to achieve relief by way of possession; becoming a shaman; 
mystical withdrawal; or good works.
<p>
Ritual as revitalization when such identity crisis occur in large parts of, or in an entire, 
community. Customary individualized procedures for achieving personal salvation then loose 
their effectivity and a new religious movement is likely to develop, led by a prophet who has 
undergone an ecstatic revelation, and aimed at the dual goal of providing new and more 
effective rituals of salvation and of creating a new and more satisfying culture.</blockquote>

Interaction or Natural Rituals
<p>
It was Goffman who pointed at the similarities between formal religious rituals and the type 
of events that occur pervasively in everyday secular life, which he named interaction rituals 
(23). According to Goffman, "in gatherings or social situations --physical arenas anywhere 
within which persons present are in perceptual range of one another, subject to mutual 
monitoring-- the individual is given an opportunity to face directly a representation, a 
somewhat iconic expression, a mock up of what he is supposed to hold dear, a presentation of 
the supposed ordering of his existence. [Such] a single, fixed element ... can be called a ritual; 
the interpersonal kind can be defined as perfunctory, conventionalized acts through which one 
individual portrays his regard for another to that other" (24). Goffman refers to a wide range 
of both verbal and non-verbal practices used by communicating individuals, aimed at 
presenting and maintaining a positive and consistent image of self in a dialogue in which both 
parties express deference to the other's demeanor. Such face work often becomes habitual and 
standardized practice, and its goal is the maintenance or re-establishment of the ritual 
equilibrium, a state in which both interactants satisfactory maintain their face (image of self). 
When such ritual reciprocity is denied, the disrespected person experiences this as an assault 
on his identity or, as Goffman calls it, a threat to face, which may lead to extreme dismay. In 
this perspective interaction is a delicate ritual balance of, on the one hand, claiming a 
preferable position and, on the other, consideration for the position of the other(s). "Each 
person, subculture and society seems to have its own characteristic repertoire of face-saving 
practices" (23). Goffman did not mean that there are no differences between the formal 
religious rituals and the formalities of the casual rendezvous' of modern actors. His point is 
that in both phenomena similar general processes are at work. Recently, Collins suggested the 
term natural rituals "to refer to those kinds of conditions which crop up, typically without 
anyone's conscious intention, which have the same shape, and similar consequences, as 
formal rituals" (25). Collins proposes that a ritual, whether natural or formal, requires the 
following ingredients:
<p>
<ol>
<li>a group of at least two people are physically assembled;
<li>they focus attention on the same object or action, and are aware that each other is 
maintaining this focus;
<li>they share a common mood or emotion.
</ol>
<p>
This third requirement seems, as Collins himself states, to miss the core of usual definitions 
of ritual --stereotyped action-- but, he explains, that are only the cosmetic aspects of formal 
ritual that bring about a state of mutual focus of attention. When these three ingredients are in 
existence, they affect the situation, "the mutual focus of attention and the common mood 
become progressively stronger" and the actors are united into "a shared reality" that separates 
their reality from what is outside, "they feel like members of a little group" (25).
<p>
Thus, the difference between formal and natural rituals mainly depends on the meaning that is 
added to them by its actors. The general mechanism seems to be the same. For example, rites 
of passage can be witnessed in both formal or religious and in natural or secular contexts. In 
that respect elaborated puberty rites in tribal societies do not principally differ from the 
initiation into a new friendship group or school class, or into (illicit) drug use. "Thus, when 
persons perform standardized acts in first using cannabis, they change from non-drug users to 
users, from persons who are immune from arrest under the drug law to potential convicts, 
from observers to participants" (26). From this perspective, formal rituals and natural rituals 
are merely the extremes of a common continuum.
<p>
Recapitulating, rituals are stereotypical behavioral sequences with a symbolic meaning, 
which, nevertheless, is not always expressively or consciously present. Moreover, 
considerable individual differences may exist between individual actors in validating the 
symbolic meaning. 
<p>
<i>Rituals of Animals and Early Man </i>
<p>
Animals, too, display certain forms of behavior that can be classified under the heading of 
ritual. Such behaviors have been exhaustively documented by ethologists. Both birds and 
mammals behave in ways that are both characterized by stereotyped repetition and a lack of a 
direct instrumental relation between means and end. The most evident examples of social 
ritual among animals can be seen in mating, nest building, and conflict or fight over pecking 
order and territory. Such displays normally occur at the beginning and end of these events 
and, serving as a kind of primitive communication device. They are meant to create a 
situation in which the acting animal is incited to perform necessary conduct. In the case of a 
social situation, it encourages complementary attitudes, directed at the performance of certain 
deportments (e.g. courting before reproductive acts) or their inhibition (e.g. mock battle 
instead of actual fighting) (2). Solitary animal rituals can also be observed. These behaviors 
are often found in response to intense but ambiguous stimulation, which surpasses the 
animal's information processing capacity, (27) and other stress provoking situations. 
Examples are rocking or circular pacing of cash-crop animals in bio-industry plants, animals 
in zoos, or bandogs. "Solitary rituals seem useful principally in reducing anxiety in situations 
of ambiguity with respect to learning or discrimination" (2). In other words, when they are 
put under stress, either by unnatural restraints or by an information overflow, animals turn to 
their automatic pilot in order to channel and ameliorate the experienced stress, and to prevent 
harmful responses. 
<p>
The origin of those behaviors may be explained by the "argument that under the pressure of 
natural selection certain emotionally motivated behaviors become formalized --in the sense of 
becoming simplified, exaggerated, and stereotyped-- and loosened from any specific context 
of releasers, and all this so that, in effect, there will be more efficient signalling, both inter- 
and intra-specifically. Instead of having to play out an act [e.g. a destructive fight], the 
animal, in effect provides a readily readable expression of his situation, specifically his intent, 
this taking the form of a ritualization of some portion of the act itself, and this indication 
(whether promise or threat) presumably allows for the negotiation of an efficient response 
from, and to, witnesses of the display" (24).
<p>
Although there is only very limited information available, it can be assumed that ritual played 
some role of importance in the experience of modern man's predecessors. Both among 
Neanderthal and Cro magnon peoples evidence of religious ritual is found. Graves of both 
peoples have been excavated, containing the carefully arranged remains of humans and, for 
them significant, animals. More commonly among the Cro Magnons, the corpses were 
smeared with red paint. Cro Magnons, further buried their deceased with grave goods and 
personal ornaments and evidence of offerings and funeral feasts have also been found. 
Moreover, they manufactured objects from parts of the human skeleton, that were probably 
meant for ceremonial or ritual usage. But, perhaps the most dramatic evidence lies in their 
artistic performances; their sculpture and painting (2).
<p>
It can now be determined that ritual, being a routine form of animal behavior, serving a vital 
purpose, even in lower animal life, in promoting opportune conduct, has been a continuity 
throughout history. It served the same functions in early man. Corresponding rituals are 
familiar to modern man. The distinction seems to lie in the self-consciousness of modern 
man's ritual action (2). The cultural and cognitive development that enabled humans to think 
in abstract modes led to rationalizations and explanations in religious terms and concept of 
historically intrinsic behaviors. The question to be answered now is what purposes serves 
ritual for modern man --what is its function? 
<p>
<i>The Function of Ritual</i>
<p>
A discussion of function of ritual must start with a discussion of the term function itself. One 
generally agrees that "the function of a cultural element is the effect of its performance or 
non-performance in a given cultural setting" (2). Beyond this consensus, interpretation often 
parts, depending on the (professional) orientation of the analyst. For sociologist and social 
anthropologists, the function of ritual will incorporate statements on the effect on the group or 
society. Psychologists and psychiatrists will refer to effects on mood, thought and learning 
processes. Likewise, biologists or psychopharmacologists will, for example, point at changes 
in neurotransmitter levels that certain rituals may bring about. Clearly, such interpretations 
refer to only a part of the picture, they are complementary and not mutually exclusive (2). 
<p>
The function of ritual not only depends on the type of analyst, but, of course, also on the level 
of analysis and the specific situation. "Rituals have various functions, depending on the 
conditions in which they take place" (12). Moreover, the function may differ for different 
actors in the same ritual. Ritual may have multiple meaning and, even further, these do not 
necessarily have to be in alignment with the intentions of the actors. Finally it must be clear 
that function cannot be looked upon in the light of cause. Cause, with its roots in the past, 
does not have to be meaningful for current intentions and effects. Rituals have thus multiple 
functions, of which some are more and others less obvious. Even "the most barbarous or 
bizarre rites and the strangest myths all express some human need, some aspect of life, be it 
individual or social" (9). As explained above, it is often depending on the analyst and the 
level of analysis which functions are emphasized. 
<p>
Often rituals are related to the fulfillment of day-to-day activities and needs. "... In spite of its 
essentially non-purposive character, [ritual] can always be transformed into purposive action. 
Use of ritual for the fulfillment of the practical needs of life is a common feature ..." (8). The 
desired results are then achieved through the effect the ritual has on its performer(s), both in 
solitary and social ritual --focussing the participants on certain practical tasks that have to be 
performed. Ritual activity quickly prepares an individual or individuals to execute an action 
with maximum efficiency. In case of one individual, this is accomplished by "resolving 
motivational conflict, reducing fear and anxiety, increasing confidence, focusing attention at 
the task at hand, and mobilizing appropriate psychophysiological systems for the execution of 
the act" (2). In social rituals, in addition, "the participants are brought more rapidly to the 
state of readiness for the cooperative execution of the act than is likely if mobilization and 
coordination were to depend upon less stereotyped communication" (2). In social ritual there 
is little ambiguity about mutual role taking and the participants are almost naturally aware of 
this (25).
<p>
Ritual activity as such can also induce actual pleasure as it gives rise to "what one might call 
an overproduction of thought, emotion and activity. The elaboration of these processes is 
accompanied by pleasurable emotion, it becomes an end in itself" (28). Indeed, it is not 
surprising that this is an important aspect in this study of human drug taking rituals.
<p>
Most of ritual's practical utility is, however, often believed to be secondary (8, 9, 28). The 
main emphasis in the analysis of ritual is on its social function. For example, the rites of 
passage have an important function in educating the young (8). Such rituals pass on the 
cultural heritage to novices and siblings and they teach the group rules by formal, and social 
learning procedures. In formal rites of passage novices are initiated into their newly acquired 
social status. However, in such ceremonies not only the initiates are touched as the values and 
beliefs that are at stake are those of the group at a very deep level (29). "The rite thus brings 
the people together and restores them to the true center of their consciousness" (8). In this 
sense, a ritual can be considered as a "condensed storehouse of a cultural tradition" (30).
<p>
Because most formal rituals were studied in a religious context "the apparent function is to 
strengthen the bonds attaching the believer to his god. [However,] they at the same time 
really strengthen the bonds attaching the individual to the society of which he is a member, 
since the god is only a figurative expression of the society" (9). The actual purpose of ritual is 
in the ritual itself --in the effect that its performance has on the social consciousness (28). 
"When the groups periodically assemble to celebrate the rites, interpersonal relations are 
renewed and a new consciousness is produced among the individuals ... Their common bonds 
are reaffirmed, their group solidarity is reinforced and society is recreated" (8). Ritual is a 
symbolic expression of the group's doctrine (31) and helps to preserve its values (8). It 
controls and regulates social situations, (32) multiplies the relations between individual group 
members and makes them more intimate with one another (9).
<p>
Ritual furthermore displays the group definitions of role and status (4) and reinforces the 
hierarchical relations between people (17). The performance of ritual also hushes struggles 
and arguments between group members (8, 33). It counterbalances disturbing actions, 
conflict, danger, crisis, etc. by carrying the opposite message of unity, harmony and order in 
form as well as in content (34). In this sense ritual is a sort of corrective mechanism or in 
cases where some form of change or adaptation is inevitable, a transformative process (12).
<p>
The essential function of ritual seems thus its effect on the collective consciousness, the 
apprehension that perpetuates group norms directed at the survival of the group or tribe. "Man 
is a tribal animal" (35). Just as many other animals, humans find great pleasure and 
satisfaction in group membership, in interaction with their congeners, their tribe (25). The 
tribe is perhaps man's most important source of identification and self-definition. "[One] must 
fully appreciate this fact [to] understand one of the most important facets of human nature. ... 
The tribal qualities of the human species colour almost every aspect of our lives" (35). Ritual 
works as a binding mechanism (31) and engenders social solidarity among its performers --
the members of the tribe (36). Such social solidarity is believed to be a basic and overriding 
human drive (37).
<p>
With this concern for social solidarity a moral solidarity has entered and with it moral 
pressures or rules of conduct (9). In order to live in a tribe and to act out feelings of solidarity, 
rules have been formed through rituals that regulate interaction. And here again, this refers to 
both formal and natural rituals. However, especially in modern society, such feelings of 
solidarity are not unlimited. In contrast with relatively small and isolated native societies, 
modern industrialized society is far from unified. Although often referred to in their media 
campaigns, a lasting global solidarity is a myth, well nurtured by organizations such as Foster 
Parents Plan. Furthermore, traditional formal tribal structures are subject to serious erosion 
and have lost much of their attractiveness and power. Secularization is a case in point. 
However, "In technological cultures such as those of the West, people have responded to the 
disappearance of formal tribes by consciously or inconsciously creating new ones" (38). As a 
result, society has become abundantly stratified and many different, and, often conflicting, 
tribes can make appeals on the individual (25).

<b>The Concept of Ritual in Studies of Drug Use</b>
<p>
<i>Introduction</i>
<p>
Psychoactive agents are primarily taken to alter the state of consciousness of the user. Altered 
states of consciousness (ASC) are universal human phenomena (39) and the use of a great 
variety of substances to achieve them is known throughout history. Indeed, the use of drugs is 
at least as old as mankind. Drug use "probably began when our ancestors browsed their way 
through the forests and found that, among the foods they sampled, some produced interesting 
changes in how they perceived, and how they could accommodate themselves to the world" 
(40). In his recent book, Intoxication, life in pursuit of artificial paradise. the American 
psychopharmacologist Siegel argues that the motivation to achieve an altered state of 
consciousness is a fourth drive; as important and part of the human condition as sex, thirst 
and hunger. Moreover, this drive to get high is not a monopoly of mankind at all. Siegel 
documents a large range of examples of drug consuming animals ranging, from insects to 
water buffalo's (41).
<p>
Besides utilizing other, non drug, methods of intoxicating oneself, such as religious ecstasy, 
ritual dancing, running, etc., psychoactive drugs have thus always played a mayor role in 
establishing ASC. Although societies may apparently differ in the value they place upon the 
drug high and the role it plays in the structuring and organization of social life, it seems 
evident that, in fact, in all historical and contemporary societies drugs do play important 
roles. ASC, being found in all human cultures, "are subject to a great deal of cultural 
patterning, stylization, ritualization, and rationalizing mythology" (39). Some notable 
contemporary examples are the chewing of Qat leaves in Jemen, the chewing of coca leaves 
in certain Andean cultures, the ingestion of a liquified extract of roasted coffee beans and the 
smoking of dried leaves of the tobacco plant in many cultures across the globe. 
<p>
Indeed, all four examples can be interpreted in terms of ritual, though the intensity of 
stylization and symbolic meaning may differ. Both coffee and Qat are social lubricants of 
which Qat use seems to be the most ritualized. In Jemen, from two in the afternoon until the 
evening almost the whole male population is busy with the chewing of Qat, mostly in social 
settings. The very importance of the Qat ritual can be even more demonstrated by the fact that 
the Jemenite government takes all important decisions on a consensus basis during Qat 
sessions. "Qat chewing is serious business in Jemen" (42). In many cultures, it is standard 
practice to offer coffee or tea to visitors in both formal and informal settings to break the ice, 
i.e. creating a favorable atmosphere for communication through the mutual participation in 
the coffee or tea drinking ritual. Among indian cultures in the Andean region the traditional 
chewing of coca leaf has in addition to relieving fatigue and hunger, also a strong symbolic 
function, as it signifies their ancient and sophisticated cultural tradition (43). In other indian 
cultures, e.g. the Aymara in Peru and Bolivia, alcohol, which in western culture has a very 
profane status, is treated as a highly sacred ritual drug (11).
<p>
<i>Drug Use Rituals</i>
<p>
It is evident that drugs played an important role in human life throughout history. Often such 
drug use was integrated in the religious canon of the performers. While many early observers 
did report the presence of various psycho active substances, they mostly played a secondary 
role in their analyses of the behaviors of the group, community or society under study. It is 
relatively recently that social scientists started to focus on drug use as an unique object of 
study. An important stimulation has been the growing concern about the increase of 
recreational use of drugs in secular contexts. Studies of drug use in its naturalistic or 
community settings are still rather sparse, but growing. Early studies dealt mainly with 
alcohol or opiate use. During the 1970s the use of psychedelics became an object of study. In 
the last decade, especially under the influence of the HIV epidemic, the behaviors of injecting 
drug users (IDUs) have gained much attention. 
<p>
Searching for recent studies that focus on the forms and meaning of drug use, that take the 
ritual experience as a starting point for analysis is a disappointing venture. Some authors refer 
to the notion of ritual in discussions on the (im)possibilities of behavioral change of IDUs 
under the menace of HIV infection. These analyses, however, lack contents and are far from 
satisfactory. These studies will be examined in chapter seventeen. First, the few studies of 
ritualistic drug use in a modern, and secular context will be discussed. These studies were 
mainly conducted before 1980. 
<p>
The one extensive description of the intravenous drug administration ritual of urban 
American heroin addicts in the 1960s comes from Agar (44). He gives a detailed description 
of the objects (works), the ritual sequence and the resulting altered states of consciousness 
(rush, high, nod, and straight), and the significance for the performer. As a result from his 
inductive analytic approach Agar arrives at the following definition of ritual: 
<p>
<blockquote>For an event to be a ritual event it must prescribe a sequence of psychomotor acts 
and this prescribed psychomotor sequence must be invested with a special meaning for the 
person performing that sequence.</blockquote>
<p>
Mainly because of its rigidly prescribed behavioral sequence, Agar interprets getting off (the 
intravenous self administration of e.g. heroin) as a ritual. And indeed, the drug administration 
sequence is a crucial point in this discussion. Its meanings and functions may vary for 
individuals. 
<p>
Another work of great importance, is that of the recently deceased Zinberg and his 
colleagues. In their detailed study of, what they called, controlled and compulsive drug use 
they found that all drug users, to a certain extent, ritualize their intake of drugs, and that 
"controlled use is chiefly supported by emerging subcultural drug using rituals and social 
sanctions" (45). Although both rituals and social sanctions (rules) seem to be directed at 
controlling the process of drug use, they claim that, in effect, the rituals of controlled and 
compulsive drug users are very similar, but that particularly the different social sanctions that 
are adhered to, distinguish both user groups. It is thus important to differentiate the two terms 
clearly as "the distinction between drug-using rituals and social sanctions is one of behavior 
versus beliefs, or practice versus dogma" (46). Zinberg proposes the following definition of a 
drug ritual:
<p>
<blockquote>Ritual refers to the stylized, prescribed behavior surrounding the use of a drug. 
This behavior may include methods of procuring, and administrating the drug, selection of 
physical and social settings for use, activities after the drug has been administered, and methods 
of preventing untoward drug effects.</blockquote>
<p>
And social sanctions are defined as:
<p>
<blockquote>The norms regarding how or whether a particular drug should be used. Social 
sanction include both the informal and often unspoken values or rules of conduct shared by a 
group and the formal laws and policies regulating drug use.</blockquote>
<p>
Zinberg et al. favor the term social sanctions instead of rituals beliefs for two reasons. "First, 
the term emphasizes that beliefs are socially derived and reinforced. Second, social sanctions 
conveys more clearly than ritual beliefs the sense that behavior and belief are separable 
concepts" (46). They use both concepts in a very secular sense, stripped from every religious 
or sacred connotation. As discussed before, the distinction between sacred and secular and 
that between instrumental and symbolic have been important discussion points among 
students of ritual. Although its existence is often hard to ascertain, a preponderance of 
symbolic over technical action is required by most writers. Behavior that is solely technical or 
recreational is often not considered ritual (47). Zinberg and his associates take a much more 
liberal stand and, as they themselves explain, violate this tradition in two distinct ways. They 
apply these terms to drug use whether the goal of the user is recreation, improved mental or 
physical performance or religious experience. And, in their opinion, drug using rituals and 
social sanctions include both rational and non rational elements (46).
<p>
Agar contends that the distinction between sacred and secular is, in fact, a concept 
constructed by social scientists. He proposes "that whatever has special meaning for a group 
member counts as an instance of sacred ritual" (44). That way he seems to take an 
intermediate stand. His notion of special meaning leaves room for an in or out group 
perspective and intragroup variation regarding the perception of the ritual. For the one (an 
insider IDU) the ritual of getting off can be a sacred event and at the same time for an other 
IDU or an outsider a secular event. Cleckner regards repetitious behavior surrounding drug 
use only as ritual in a very general and secular sense (20). She seeks support by Burroughs, 
the ultimate romanticizer of addiction and drugs, who wrote that "there is nothing sacred 
about heroin or indeed about street use of drugs in general" (48).
<p>
However, the matter is not that simple. Burroughs himself is rather ambivalent regarding the 
subject. In <u>Naked Lunch<u> he first writes "Junk is profane and quantitative like money" 
and denies the existence of opium cults, which is an inaccuracy. But a few pages later he 
writes "Junk is surrounded by magic and taboos, curses and amulets" (49). Cleckner sees thus 
little room for symbolic elaboration in shared street customs. In her view, these are 
predominantly pragmatic and rational. "Significant are the concrete results or effects of any 
action, not their reality status" (20). It may well be true that "A dope fiend can almost always 
give a practical explanation for anything he does" (20). But this does, of course, not exclude 
symbolic meanings. It merely means that, as Du Toit writes in his discussion on cannabis 
rituals in South Africa, "the ritual ... is not aimed at any agent, entity, or force. The 
satisfaction of the act is in its completion; it is an act which serves to give unity, identity, and 
transition to the participants, its value is in its performance" (26). Thus, drug use rituals are 
not focussed at sacred goals but at social goals and in that way they are not different from 
both the formal and natural rituals discussed before. 
<p>
<i>Conditions of Ritualization: Availability and Drug Use Rituals</i>
<p>
Both historically and geographically, societies differ in respect to the drugs approved of, and 
those deemed unacceptable. There is no global agreement on which drugs are acceptable, and 
which are not. Nor has there been one, any given time. Furthermore, societies may change 
their opinions on certain drugs in time, and have, in fact, done so many times. At end of the 
20th century, probably facilitated by modern communication technology, the use of drugs has 
become a issue of global discussion and concern. There are largely two competing, internally 
coherent perspectives on the use of drugs. These are a deterrence perspective and a 
normalization perspective (50). It can be ascertained, that from a global perspective, 
deterrence currently seems to be most appealing to mainstream society (the social group with 
the political and economic power to formally enact rules in law and with the control over a 
specialized body to enforce those rules (51)) and is thus applied in most efforts to control the 
use of drugs. The reactions of mainstream society towards drug use have, of course, 
important consequences for the nature of drug use and drug problems. One of the most far-
reaching reactions of mainstream society, has been to rule the use of certain drugs out of 
order by criminalizing these drugs and actively enforcing their prohibition. In this section the 
effect of the application of the deterrence perspective on ritualization processes around drug 
use is examined.
<p>
The criminalization of use and possession of most drugs has profound effects on their 
availability in terms of price, quality and accessibility. Because of prohibition, drugs like 
heroin and cocaine are sold in closed illegal distribution networks, a black market without 
any quality controls (both on purity levels and the composition of the cuts) and with 
exorbitantly high prices. Price, quantity and quality clearly are strongly interrelated. It seems, 
however, that quality, and to a lesser degree quantity are more influenced by repression / 
criminalization then price. For example, although at very different levels, unit prices of heroin 
are rather stable in both Rotterdam (15.- to 20.- for the smallest sales unit of  a tenth gram 
and 80.- to 110.- for a gram) and New York City ($10.- for a bag, the street sales unit, 
containing  20 to 30 milligram and  $200.- for a gram). On the street level the sales unit is 
thus a price unit and not a quantity unit. In Rotterdam, South West Asian base heroin has 
been available since the early 1980s and the purity has been rather constant at  40% (52, 53). 
The New York heroin market is dominated by South East Asian heroin. Although recent 
information points at a rising purity level, the general opinion of both New York users and 
researchers is that purity of street level heroin is generally low and variable. 
<p>
For a long time, it was a popular belief, both among researchers as among the lay audience, 
that in a heroin career the process of developing a physical dependence steadily and 
inevitably would lead to an increased intake of the drug and subsequently to injecting drug 
use. Yet, recent research found that this progression into more efficient or harder 
administration rituals generally results from actual or perceived economic pressure (54, 55, 
56, 57, 58, 59). The onset and maintenance of injecting drug use is furthermore enhanced or 
prevented by specific socio-cultural factors such as, traditionally rooted drug administration 
rituals (60), cultural or religiously defined avoidances (e.g. needle taboos), (58) peer group 
pressure (54, 55), social learning and lifestyle related role model identification processes. 
Besides, many careers of heavy drug users are characterized by intense fluctuations in use 
level, influenced by availability of money and/or methadone; by detention; stress; guilt 
feelings over ones level of use; periods of voluntary or mandatory moderation; or abstinence, 
to name a few (61).
<p>
In general, initial and early stage heroin users opt for routes other than injecting. In The 
Netherlands this mostly concerns smoking, with some exceptions of sniffing (62, 63). In New 
York sniffing is the most popular route of administration among novice heroin users, (54, 55)  
although recent reports also signal a growing number of new heroin smokers (64). 
Nevertheless, while in the U.S.A. the majority of heroin users eventually turn to injecting, the 
trend in The Netherlands is very clearly away from injecting (62, 63, 65). The recent reports 
on a shift away from injecting in New York seem, at this point, too preliminary to draw 
conclusions about a trend. Nevertheless, if the drug quality in New York really has risen to 
the reported levels, such a trend becomes well possible. From an AIDS prevention 
perspective this would be an encouraging phenomenon. On the other hand, many (long term) 
recreational heroin users in the U.S.A. also opt for injecting primarily due to economic 
considerations (poor drug quality) (45).
<p>
It is thus clear that different levels of drug availability are associated with different 
administration rituals. For a drug and the activities surrounding its administration to get 
ritualized, limited availability is an important condition, but in itself it is not a sufficient 
explanation. Combined with the recognized value the drug has for users, it is. The classical 
assumption of ritual value is that it attaches to objects that are socially important for secular 
reasons (36, 66) and that while economic value of objects depends on utility, ritual value is 
dependent on scarcity (36, 67). Thus, an object can only be socially important for secular 
reasons when: 
<p>
<ul>
<li>The objective importance of the object (the secular reason) is recognized by the 
individual members of the group and, 
<li>This collective consciousness of objective importance is underlined by a limited 
availability of the object.
</ul>
<p>
The limited availability becomes a constant reminder of the object's recognized objective 
importance, inducing a psycho-social process by which it gains a substantial subjective 
importance. While objective importance or utility is a sufficient condition for, and subjective 
importance may increase economic value, the latter is essential for ritual value. Scarcity not 
only increases the economic value of objects, it can also lead to the addition of symbolic 
elaboration (social importance). This creates ritual value and, hence, the development of 
ritualization processes. Thus, when Durkheim writes that such "an object ... inspires respect 
when the representation expressing it in the mind is gifted with such a force that it 
automatically causes or inhibits actions, without regard for any consideration relative to their 
useful or injurious effects", (9) illegal drugs like heroin or cocaine make a convincing case. 
(italics in original) It can now also be concluded that the condition of special meaning in 
Agar's definition of ritual event has a double meaning, referring to instrumental and symbolic 
goals. The former refers thus to the (subjective) awareness of the objective importance of the 
act, which is the instrumental imperative (68) for its performance and the formation of the 
(sub)culture, centered around this act. The latter, induced by the integrative imperatives, 
inducing normatively regulated behavior aimed at the perpetuation of the culture, (68) is 
symbolic elaboration, thus added meaning (9).
<p>
As an illustration, consider a substance of which the use is known to all --water. Water is an 
important, not to say, elemental object to all living species. In most Western industrialized 
societies the distribution of water is efficiently arranged. Elaborate and high technology 
transportation and filtering systems secure a sufficient availability of high quality drinking 
water and it is used generously. In principle you can get water when you need or want it. The 
availability is high. Although objectively water is of great importance to man's existence, this 
is taken for granted. Most people are not (subjectively) aware of the essential importance of 
water. They hardly (if ever) have experienced shortages or scarcity, it is not a matter of much 
consideration or thought. Now imagine any Sahel country, where the soil, because of all the 
cracks, has the appearance of a giant jigsaw puzzle. In this (not so imaginary) country it does 
not often rain and reliable water distribution networks are absent. Here, social and economic 
activity is often organized around the procurement of water. The few wells available are at 
considerable distance from each other and their level is carefully monitored. Frequently life is 
geographically organized at close distance to the wells. When travelling, the supply of water 
and the distance between the wells on the way are carefully taken into account when planning 
the journey. In agricultural efforts water is a constant source of concern. 
<p>
Living under such conditions, one is daily reminded of the importance of water. As Turnbull 
wrote, "... in this country a gift of water could be a gift of life" (69). It is, however, not only 
an objectively important substance, but also subjectively. This consciousness determines and 
structures the daily activities to a great extend. In such regions water is a structurally, though 
often periodically, scarce object. Thus, the availability of water can be classified as low. It is 
therefore not surprising that in such regions one can find intricate calendrical or crisis rites of 
intensification (2) to secure a good rain season or to bring rain to end a drought, For example 
among the Mossi, a people living in Central and Eastern Burkina Faso, water has a special 
meaning. In the Western world water is not ritualized (maybe with some small exceptions 
among farmers to whom water may also be structurally scarce). When in western society 
water suddenly gets scarce, people do react, but not in a ritualized way (e.g. before the water 
tap is shut down, they fill a kettle or a bucket, or with media attention for tap water pollution 
people (temporarily) switch to bottled mineral water. In this context, sharing water is not an 
important or even meaningful action. In a sahel country sharing water is a very important and 
meaningful action. 
<p>
The ritual value of objects is thus determined by the sentiments that they generate due to their 
scarcity. And indeed drugs, which have proven to be of great importance to man throughout 
the history (41), combined with their illegal status form a strong impetus for ritualization, as 
is documented in several studies (20, 44, 45). The term ritualization implies that ritual is not a 
static condition, but rather a gradual and dynamic process, correlating with availability. 
Ritualization may further vary with cultural conditions and idiosyncratic factors. As Agar 
argued, "for any ritual in some group, there will be intragroup variation in the extent to which 
the event is perceived as a ritual" (45).
<p>
The third aspect of availability is accessibility. Unlike alcohol, caffeine, nicotine and, in 
many cities in The Netherlands, cannabis, heroin and cocaine cannot be purchased in an 
ordinary outlet, due to their illicit and highly stigmatized status. When an individual wants to 
buy these drugs, he must turn to alternative sources --closed illegal distribution networks. 
These networks form the bottom of the trafficking pyramid and the drugs are generally sold 
by users to users --the difference between the dealer and user is ambiguous and protean. Due 
to their illegal status and the resulting police enforcement such drug user networks are not 
easily accessible, as their members are normally (necessarily) highly distrustful of strangers 
or outsiders and conceal their activities. It has been put forward that ritual interaction plays an 
important role in these networks to distinguish users from non users and prevent police 
detection (70). These networks are furthermore unstable, both geographically and in time. In 
addition, the supply from higher echelons may stagnate. Hence, the individual needs up-to-
date information on where the action is and the prevailing codes. This requires active and 
enduring participation in drug use defined networks. The enforcement of mainstream society's 
formal drug rules has thus acted as a strong impetus for the formation of a deviant subculture 
with specific codes and rituals around the transactions in, and use of drugs.
<p>
<i>Conditions of Ritualization: Deviance, Subculture and Drug Use Rituals</i>
<p>
Not only the formal, legally enacted, rules contribute to the formation of a subculture. Becker 
explained that informal agreements, "enforced by informal sanctions of various kinds" also 
fortify deviance. The construction of and attempts to enforce both formal and informal rules 
that define situations and their appropriate behavior are, according to Becker, a main 
characteristic of all social groups. They specify some actions as right or good and others as 
wrong or bad. Those that infract the rules are labeled as deviants or outsiders. However, 
deviance is not so much a trait or characteristic of the rule-breaker as he may be breaking a 
rule of one group, by obeying those of another. Also, the process of labeling is fallible; those 
who have been labeled deviant do not constitute a homogeneous category just because they 
have committed the same deviant act. Others may have committed the same act, but without 
notice and again others may not have committed the act, but be, wrongly, labeled as deviants. 
Thus, concludes Becker, "deviance is created by society; social groups create deviance by 
making the rules whose infraction constitutes deviance, and by applying those rules to 
particular people and labeling them as outsiders." Ergo, whether behaviors are deviant not 
only depends on the rules or laws but also on how people react to it or the enforcement of 
those rules. "Deviance is not a quality that lies in the behavior itself, but in the interaction 
between the person who commits an act and those who respond to it" (51). Once being 
labeled deviant with reference to a certain rule, "people [often] automatically assume that [a 
person] possesses other undesirable traits allegedly associated with it" (51). Public knowledge 
of (even single time) heroin use may label a person as a junkie, with the association of 
numerous other attributes, such as criminal, untrustworthy, dishonest, violent, etc.. Likewise, 
such identification overrules and prevents the identification of other, possibly more favorable, 
identifications. "The deviant identification becomes the controlling one. Treating a person as 
though he were generally deviant rather than specifically deviant produces a self-fulfilling 
prophecy" (51).
<p>
Goffman pointed out that many of these processes are far more general and can be applied to 
all (groups of) people who possess an undesired differentness or depart negatively from the 
particular expectations of the, as he calls them, normals. Such a differentness, or stigma, 
"constitutes a special discrepancy between virtual and actual social identity" (71). Goffman 
distinguishes three different types of stigma --physical deformities, blemishes of individual 
character, and tribal stigma (race, religion). In the second category mental disorders, 
imprisonment, addiction, alcoholism, homosexuality, unemployment, suicide attempts, and 
radical political behavior can all be found. The possession of a stigma can place the bearer in 
two different situations when interacting with normals. The stigma is either known or evident 
--as is the case with some physical deformities of tribal stigmas (such as race)--, or not. In the 
first case, Goffman speaks of the discredited, who have to manage tension while interacting 
with others. The latter is a discreditable. He is in a somewhat more favorable position, but in 
order to prevent detection, has to manage information on his stigma with great care. Both 
managing tension and passing are stressful activities (71). Drug users will find themselves 
often in either situation. 
<p>
The results of these processes will lead the person to actively involve in the subculture which 
has been formed around the stigma or deviant activity. In the previous sections the human 
need/drive for solidarity was discussed. Humans want to belong to a group. A stigma or 
deviant label thwarts participation in other more conventional roles or groups and 
progressively changes the lay out of day-to-day life considerably (72). Such processes can 
clearly be witnessed in the case of heroin users: losing ones job or being thrown out of the 
house upon discovery of (even single time) use, imprisonment, the daily routine of the 
methadone program, etc. Being denied satisfactory participation in other groups limits ones 
choices and is, therefore, another reason for participation in the subculture. Once the step into 
active participation in the subculture has been made, a person soon finds out that this has 
distinctive advantages. Among his own "he can withdraw for moral support and for the 
comfort of feeling at home, at ease, accepted as a person who really is like any other person" 
(71); feelings that are otherwise denied. "It gives them a sense of common fate, of being in 
the same boat", (51) where he can talk freely with people who, because they are in the same 
position, will generally understand, if not agree, about all the subjects related to the particular 
stigma. In the subculture people meet who "Knowing from their own experience what it is 
like to have this particular stigma, ... can provide the individual with instruction in the tricks 
of the trade", (71) so that "he learns how to carry on his deviant activity with a minimum of 
trouble. Every deviant group has a great stock of lore on such subjects and the new recruit 
learns it quickly" (51).
<p>
The deviant group has furthermore a common set of norms and values that function as a self-
justifying rationale that counters conventional doubts and provides seemingly consistent 
reasons for the deviant practice (51). These norms are often said to differ from those in 
mainstream culture. Sometimes they are worked out into full-fledged ideologies and in some 
cases these claim that the deviant is not only equal to the non-deviants but superior (71). The 
most explicit examples of this can be found in the gay and lesbian subcultures in which 
ideologies range from apologetic to militant separatism. The use of psychedelics in the 1960s 
and 1970s was sometimes promoted as mind expansion and a means of becoming a better 
person. Nevertheless, regarding drug users, the question can be put forward how far their 
norms and values actually differ from those in mainstream culture as their secondary 
deviance, (73) including the deviant norms and values, may purely be a consequence of the 
attached label. Such differences are surely not absolute and subject to individual variation. 
<p>
It is evident that a deviant subculture unites individuals that share a common fate, having to 
deal with common problems. It offers a "set of perspectives and understandings about what 
the world is like and how to deal with it, and a set of routine activities based on those 
perspectives" (51). When these routine activities are addressed as rituals the connection with 
Durkheim's concept of religion becomes clear, as he defined the latter as "an unified system 
of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and forbidden -
-beliefs and practices which unite one single moral community called a church, all those who 
adhere to them" (9). The comparison between a religious community in the Durkheimian 
sense and the drug subculture can now be made. The contemporary conditions under which 
its devotees have to practice their creed, bears, especially in countries with a War on Drugs or 
Zero Tolerance policy, a remarkable analogy with those of the European reformatists under 
the inquisition in the Middle Ages. Under such circumstances "Life ... oscillates between 
states of extreme mental dejection and extreme mental joy. Crises, calamities and 
disappointments of numerous sorts which are ever occurring ... tend to disrupt the normal 
functioning of life and create a veritable condition of social dysphoria. Rituals on such 
occasions serve to counterbalance the disturbing actions of these adverse circumstances and 
restore social euphoria" (8).
<p>
While this comparison is somewhat metaphorical, it illustrates the general mechanism at 
work. The more a deviant group (deviant from the dominant behavior, norms and values) is 
set apart and put under pressure, the more it will profile itself as a deviant group. The more 
stereotypical deviant behavior, norms and values will then get emphasized and reinforced, 
resulting in a highly separated, intra-dependent, monofocussed subculture, which members 
are very distrustful towards mainstream culture. This implies again that ritualization is a 
process, subject to the reactions of the mainstream culture.

In this chapter the terms used in this thesis are defined and the research questions and 
hypotheses presented. Ensuing, the methodology of the ethnographic study is discussed and 
some characteristics of the study participants are described. Most of this thesis is based on 
this empirical study. Where additional material or data sources are used these are described.
<p>
<a name="term"></a>
<b>Definition of Terms</b>
<p>
Chapter 2. established that all definitions of ritual shared some condition of form. Ritual 
behavior should be either stylized, stereotyped, determined, standardized, repetitive, 
reassertive, or exhibit striking or incongruous rigidity --different terms for the same 
requirement. Uncertainty about the direct aim of the behavioral sequence of acts and signals 
is not allowed. It may not convey new information, it is fixed, prescribed and directed at 
creating a common emotion. Opinions diverge regarding the object of the ritual action. Some 
authors put an emphasis on the sacred character of the acts, others do not. Be it sacred or 
secular, the event should, however, have some symbolic meaning. This characteristic must 
have a preponderance over the technical purposiveness. This formulation leaves room for 
individual differences in the perception of the symbolic value of the actions. Thus, when 
Zinberg et al. found that rituals do not distinguish between, the individuals they classified 
compulsive or controlled drug users (1), this cann also be applied to the formal religious 
rituals of any church. Church rituals do not distinguish the deep religious devotees from the 
opportunistic non-believer who visits church to meet with social expectations or control.
<p>
Zinberg's definition is largely focussed on the process of drug administration. Using it strictly 
may lead to some omissions in the analysis of ritual behavior of drug users. For this reason 
Agar's definition seems the most suitable and, therefore, it is used in this study. 
<p>
<blockquote>Definition of a Ritual Event
<p>
For an event to be a ritual event it must prescribe a sequence of psychomotor acts and this 
prescribed psychomotor sequence must be invested with a special meaning for the person 
performing that sequence (2).</blockquote>
<p>
Besides rituals, drug users share a specific set of rules or norms regulating the use of drugs 
and group interactions. Zinberg distinguished two kinds of norms or social sanctions; formal 
ones --those enacted in laws and policies-- and informal ones --those developed in the drug 
using peer group. Both drug taking rituals and informal social sanctions regarding drug use 
provide the user with "instruction in, and reinforcement for maintaining patterns of illicit drug 
use which do not interfere with ordinary functioning and methods for use which minimize 
untoward drug effects" (3). Formal social norms regarding drug use, i.e. the drug laws, do no 
such thing. They merely prohibit drug use. Consequently, they are de facto broken by all 
users of illicit drugs. For recreational drug users, who may be more eager to adhere to the 
formal laws, this may be a source of stress. However, heavy or regular drug users break the 
formal norms regarding drug use on a regular basis and therefore these laws seem to have lost 
much of their deterrent power. The worries of heavy drug users do not so much concern the 
actual breaking of the formal norms, but rather staying a few steps ahead of the enforcers of 
the norms. 
<p>
Formal norms may have some influence on whether or not people start using illicit drugs, but 
do not have a regulating effect on the actual use of drugs, as they do not provide instructions 
or rules for safe or controlled use. Such a situation does not foster and reinforce the 
development of socially accepted models of controlled drug use. As a consequence, norms of 
controlled use have been developed by users themselves through interaction and diffusion 
processes in, and between social groups, intrinsic to the practice of social drug use. Formal 
rules regarding illicit drug use not only fail to reinforce safe use, their active enforcement 
even obstructs the development and communication of safe standards to a large extend. As a 
result, both rituals and informal norms surrounding the use of illicit drugs can be seen to 
possess idiosyncratic features (1).
<p>
Zinberg et al. found that in their study, in contrast with rituals, social sanctions differentiated 
controlled users from the compulsive ones (1). Control, however, is a relative notion. Many 
careers of heavy drug users are characterized by alternating periods of abstinence, controlled 
and uncontrolled use (4). Thus, it is here hypothesized that social sanctions aimed at control 
and reduction of harm are also expected among drug users, whose drug use, according to 
certain standards (e.g. those applied by Zinberg), may be called uncontrolled. Determination 
of such categories as controlled v.s. compulsive use, or e.g. recreational v.s. addicted use is, 
however, hampered by huge definitional problems. This problem will be discussed at the end 
of this section. Furthermore, norms "identify behavior that ought or ought not to occur, [and 
therefore] behavior may (and often does) depart from norms" (5). As his main study theme 
was the distinction between controlled and compulsive users of illicit drugs, Zinberg's 
definition of norm or social sanction (the norms regarding how or whether a particular drug 
should be used) centers strongly around the actual intake of the drugs. The norms found in the 
drug subculture are, of course, often centered around drugs, the object of common interest. 
However, his definition may lead to omission of other important social rules prevalent in the 
drug subculture. A more general definition of norm or rule is expedient; one that includes 
both the rules directly tied to the intake of drugs, and those that deal with other situations that 
occur in the drug subculture. Becker's definition covers these requirements:
<p>
<blockquote>Definition of Social Rules
<p>
Social rules define situations and the kinds of behavior appropriate to them, specifying some 
actions as right and forbidding others as wrong (6).</blockquote>
<p>
Chapter 2.3.3 extensively discussed the influence of the restricted availability of drugs on 
their potential to become an object of ritualization. At this point this property will be defined.
<p>
<blockquote>Definition of a Ritual Object
<p>
In order for an object to get ritualized, that is, obtain ritual value, it must be of substantial 
subjective importance (special meaning) to the persons involved, and be structurally scarce, that 
is, have a low availability.</blockquote>
<p>
The term drug availability is rather complicated to define, because it is dependent on several 
variables, functioning at different levels. A certain commodity can be highly attainable, but 
have a price so high that only few can afford it. Therefore, a definition of drug availability 
must take into account not only the actual presence of the product, but also its price level (as 
e.g. influenced by restrictive measures of the enforcers of the drug laws) related to the 
financial position of the user, which, for example, depends on the "possession of the 
conventional and/or criminal skills to provide money to purchase [drugs]" (7). The User's 
financial position in relation to the drug is, however, not only dependent on her/is income 
(and, of course, other expenses), but also on her/is tolerance and/or craving. This, in turn, 
brings up the pharmacological properties of the drug. Although equally available, heroin 
availability may be perceived completely different than cocaine availability, depending on 
preference or, more significantly, use level. Still, there is more at issue. Access to illicit drugs 
requires knowledge of, mostly surreptitious vending sites and the skills to distinguish a good 
deal from bogus drugs. This routinely leads to active participation in drug use / dealing networks or dependence on other drug users.  Finally, the user must have the skills to actually use the drug.  For example, a substantial number of female injecting drug users (IDUs) lack this skill and are consequently dependent on their male partner to  get off (8).  "In short, availability is a product of all those opportunities and obstacles that may influence a ... user's prospect for ultimately introducing a quantity of the drug into his or her [system] (7).  It is thus clear that availability is highly variable, depending on many factors that may differ with individuals and situations. In this study the perception and experience of the users is of main importance, as this ultimately has consequences for the level of ritualization. For that reason, 
the definition utilized must include the perception of the users. 
<p>
<blockquote>Definition of Perceived Drug Availability
<p>
Perceived drug availability refers to the efforts a user must go through in order to procure the 
desired drug, as assessed by the user. It includes general aspects, such as price and quality, and 
personal aspects, such as financial position and money making skills, knowledge of drug 
distribution networks, drug taking skills and drug of choice.</blockquote>
<p>
Throughout this thesis the research participants are addressed as drug users or users, 
sometimes as recreational or, in contrast, as heavy or regular users. Likewise, their use of 
intoxicating substances is referred to as (heavy) use. Terms such as addict, junkie, abuse, 
misuse, (physical and/or psychological) dependence and addiction are, as much as possible, 
avoided. This choice is grounded in both pragmatic and conceptual reasons. 
<p>
To start with the latter, although efforts to formulate appropriate terms, definitions and 
concepts are undertaken for decades, in particularly by successive WHO Expert Committees 
on Drug Dependence (9), consensus on nomenclature remains absent in the scientific 
community, in particular in the medical and social sciences. In 1984 the author conducted a 
literature review into the definitions of the addiction concept. The main conclusions of this 
study are here summarized. 
<p>
<blockquote>The development of the addiction concept (and related concepts) has been 
severely influenced by moral, political and legal forces. These concepts and the resulting 
definitions are furthermore developed based on experiences with non-random samples, 
generally in treatment settings. In practice, the developed terminology (abuse, misuse, 
addiction, dependence, etc.) is hardly workable. A scientifically sound distinction of these terms 
is absent. The majority of the reviewed literature did not define the terminology used. This is a 
major shortcoming, in particular because in many of the reviewed literature, some theory 
regarding addiction was presented. The definitions encountered in the review were in majority 
so dissimilar, that it is impossible to speak of, even a semblance of scientific agreement 
(10).</blockquote>
<p>
A major shortcoming of the efforts to produce a definition of, for example, addiction or drug 
abuse is not only that already in the word choice a (linguistic) value judgment is apparent, but 
even more, such concepts are often presented as isolated notions, without acknowledging the 
inevitable "central cultural conceptions of motivation and behavior" (11) akin to, and variable 
with, every culture. As Cohen formulated it recently: "[The medical and social] sciences seem 
to be unable to describe and explain the phenomenon of drug use without an unusually strong 
bias. This bias is produced by a cultural dependency on concepts of much larger significance 
than drug use itself" (12). The first efforts to formulate a nomenclature (and theories) on the 
phenomenon of drug use date from the late nineteenth century; a period in which the booming 
medical and psychiatric disciplines were poignantly influenced by the temperance and anti-
opium movements. As Berridge writes: "In many respects the apparent scientific progress 
represented by their elaboration marked only the reformation of moral reactions to opiate use 
in a changed setting. Moral views were given scientific respectability through their 
propagation by medical specialists. Doctors were reformulating and presenting old moral 
concepts in an area where, as examination of treatment methods very clearly shows, they had 
little to offer" (13). Current thinking about and concepts of drug use are thus largely rooted in 
reformulated moral concepts. This led Szasz to question and ultimately deny the legitimacy 
of the (psychiatric) notion of addiction. He argues that addiction and related dogma's have 
never been questioned and are based on acceptance of conventional (moral) definitions of 
certain behaviors and circular reasoning in constructing a pseudo-scientific explanation, 
justifying the moral choice. Without repudiating the possible negative aspects of drug use he 
writes: "[T]he difference between someone using a drug and his being addicted to it is not a 
matter of fact, but a matter of our moral attitude and political strategy toward him" (14). In 
this line of thinking one can easily substitute drug use for other behavioral expressions, not 
sanctioned by mainstream culture (those in power), such as non-chemically induced altered 
states of consciousness (madness), homosexuality, masturbation and other forms of divergent 
sexuality, abortion and even various forms of criminality. It is therefore not surprising that in 
late nineteenth century similar disease views emerged on e.g. madness, alcoholism and 
homosexuality (13). Such a comparison illustrates the relative status of these concepts, as it is 
clear that the values, and thus the definitions connected with them, are subject to change, both 
geographically and over time. It is thus clear that, although current definitions are often 
presented as such, it is not possible to formulate objective definitions of the social phenomena 
such as the above. This led Cohen to call the complex of activities and realities around the 
phenomenon of drug use social constructions (12). For further information on the theoretical 
aspects of this discussion (such as e.g. the power aspects) the reader is referred to the writings 
of, among others, Szasz (14, 15) and Peele (11).
<p>
Besides these conceptual considerations, there is a strong pragmatic argument for the above 
choice, largely determined by the design of the study (discussed in depth in section 3.3). The 
most important mode of data collection has been participant observation. Drug users were 
observed using drugs in their own territoria, mainly at so called house addresses where heroin 
and cocaine are sold and used. How can this group be characterized? Are they abusers, 
uncontrolled or compulsive users, problematic users of the drugs they consume? Are they 
addicted? The people frequenting these places are mostly involved in drug use on a daily 
basis, but this does not count for all visitors. Therefore, these labels cannot be attached. 
<p>
Since some years now, one can observe a -scientifically correct-- trend away from the term 
addicts, substituting it for drug users or merely users (16). Recent Dutch interview studies 
have utilized more objective and quantifiable inclusion criteria based on the frequency of 
opiate use (e.g. a regular opiate user defined as a person who uses opiates at least four days a 
week or a daily user defined as a person who uses opiates each day or almost each day (five 
to six days a week)) (16, 17). In the participant observation approach utilized in this study it 
was not possible to assess data on frequency of use. This would have severely affected the 
principal non-intrusive character of the methodology. But, more important, there was no need 
for such criteria, as the main interest of the project was to study the actual drug self-
administration rituals surrounding the use of heroin and cocaine. As the studies of Zinberg 
determined, the rituals do not distinguish between user groups --the actual behavioral 
sequence is in essence the same.

<b>Research Questions</b>
<p>
This dissertation presents the results of an explorative ethnographic field research into the 
drug taking behaviors of regular users of heroin and cocaine in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. 
For this purpose the study used the concept of ritual. This concept has been utilized in a large 
number of classic cultural anthropological studies and, in a somewhat lesser extent, in 
sociological studies. Its explicit application in studies of illicit drug use, however, is limited 
to a few, though very interesting, ones. As a consequence, this study started with rather 
general research questions, resulting in an open focus ethnographic approach. Its major aim 
was to generate knowledge and hypotheses about the ritualized behaviors surrounding the 
intake of heroin and cocaine; about the patterns, meanings, functions, and possible health 
implications of these rituals, grounded in the descriptions of the everyday behaviors of active 
users. The research questions of this dissertation can be grouped in the following clusters:
<p>

<li><I>Patterns, Function and Meaning of Drug Administration Rituals</I>
<p>
1.1  What ritualized behavior patterns can be distinguished surrounding the self-

<b>Methodology</b>
<p>
<I>Introduction</I>
<p>
Discussions on the value of quantitative and qualitative research designs and techniques have 
a lengthy tradition in the social scientific literature. Quantitatively oriented researchers often 
question the generalizability of qualitative data. Ethnographers themselves have also 
discussed the intellectual legitimacy of their methodologies (18). Qualitative researchers have 
expressed doubts about the validity of quantitative instruments and the interpretation of 
numeric data. Both methodologies have strong and weak points and they often describe 
different aspects of the same social world. Of importance and seemingly rather obvious, is 
that the specific research question should determine the methodological approach. Some 
research questions require a quantitative design, for example, when researching known 
populations and when dealing with phenomena about which already some scientific 
knowledge exists. For the research questions posed in this thesis, in an area where little 
scientific knowledge exists, an explorative, and primarily qualitative design is suitable. As 
Lambert and Wiebel stated: 
<p>
<blockquote>"[e]thnographic research methods are appropriate for topics about which little is 
known, primarily because ethnography is by its nature fundamental and exploratory, preparing 
the way for more rigorous studies that strive for precision and quantification. ... Ethnography 
serve[s] to fill knowledge gaps and set[s] the groundwork for further scientific inquiry. ... It is at 
this exploratory, descriptive stage of research that ethnographic and qualitative methods can 
make significant contributions to the knowledge and understanding of problems and to the 
formulation of subsequent questions for quantitative research, including clinical studies, 
laboratory experiments, and population-based surveys" (19).</blockquote>
<p>
Working with unknown or hidden populations makes it nearly impossible to use standard 
random sampling techniques. As Wiebel writes:
<p>
<blockquote>"Because the use of illicit intoxicants is largely a covert activity in our society, it 
is not possible to enumerate all individuals who engage in such behaviors. Representative 
sampling, irrespective of scientific merit, is quite simply not possible in relation to the 
numerous varieties of phenomena at issue (20)".</blockquote>
<p>
Moreover, data collected by self-report techniques may often be highly biased if they reflect 
socially undesirable and criminalized activities. Ethnographic field observations can provide 
an opportunity to overcome the potential disadvantages of questionnaires or interviews by 
directly recording behaviors. Biases of memory, self perception, fear and mistrust are 
traversed. Nevertheless, ethnography has its own limitations. As previously noted, the 
validity and generalizability of findings have been questioned (21). The researchers presence 
might alter the context and behaviors of the study group. However, the collective experience 
of the ethnography of socially undesirable behaviors has indicated that with due care and time 
the researcher can become part of the furniture (13). Group members live within well-
established traditions that constrain their actions. While the presence of the researcher may 
introduce a new constraint, the weight of traditional constraints routinely prevails (22). The 
validity of ethnographic data can be further improved through appropriate controls on site and 
subject selection, development of trust, observational strategies and protocols of data 
recording (23).
<p>
The data for this research were mainly collected between February 1988 and May 1989, while 
some additional observations were recorded between May 1989 and December 1991. The 
principal methodology can best be described as open focus street ethnography. Intensive 
participant observation was conducted of drug users' self-administration of heroin and 
cocaine at dealing places, their homes, and public places in two neighborhoods of Rotterdam 
characterized by high concentrations of drug activity. This open focus ethnography permitted 
the research team to see things they were not looking for. The discovery of frontloading 
provides an excellent example of the scientific value of such serendipity. In 1754, Horace 
Walpole first coined the term serendipity. The term was first printed in 1833 when a 
collection of Walpole's letters were published. Walpole introduced the term as follows: (24)
<p>
<blockquote>"This discovery, indeed, is almost of that kind which I call Serendipity, a very 
expressive word, which, as I have nothing better to tell you, I shall endeavour to explain to you: 
you will understand it better by the derivation than by the definition. I once read a silly fairy 
tale, called "The Three Princes of Serendip:" as their Highnesses travelled, they were always 
making discoveries, by accident and sagacity, of things they were not in quest of: for instance, 
one of them discovered that a mule blind of the right eye had travelled the same road lately, 
because the grass was eaten only on the left side, where it was worse than on the right --now do 
you understand Serendipity?" (25).</blockquote>
<p>
Fleming's discovery of the antibiotic activity of the penicillium fungus in 1928 is perhaps the 
most famous example of serendipity. 
<p>
The serendipitous discovery of frontloading strongly influenced the further development of 
the research project and the theoretical analysis of the data. Empirical facts help with starting 
a theory, as Merton in 1957 remarked: "The serendipity pattern concerns the rather common 
experience of observing an unanticipated, abnormal and strategic fact that becomes the reason 
for the development of a new theory or for the extension of an existing theory" (26). The 
discovery of frontloading and the realization of its potential significance served as the 
stimulation to further scrutinize the phenomenon and place it in a wider frame of knowledge. 
Evidently, this has resulted in some diversion from the ideas in the original research proposal, 
but "[t]he development of science cannot be straightjacketed. The most interesting 
discoveries [are found] outside of the vested structures" (24).
<p>
<I>Research Sites</I>
<p>
In order to study drug users, one first has to make contacts with them. Most studies of 
compulsive drug users have been carried out in treatment settings such as methadone 
programs, residential therapeutic communities, clinics or other institutional settings such as 
prisons. When one wants to study drug users and their behaviors in their natural setting these 
locations are not suitable. In some instances, they can be used as a starting point to make 
contacts with users that are willing to take the researcher to natural congregation sites, such as 
copping (buying) zones, house addresses or shooting galleries. That was not the case in this 
study. Rotterdam is a city with approximately 580.000 residents. The number of heroin users 
is estimated between 2500 and 3500 (27, 28). Although, drug users are not confined to a 
particular part of the city and in many neighborhoods drugs such as heroin and cocaine can be 
bought, there are a few areas with heightened drug activity. As a result of prior experience in 
the Rotterdam drug field, these areas were identified beforehand. Two strategic research sites 
(29) were selected because they represented significant variations in the areas of high 
concentration drug activity.
<p>
The first research site was the zone around the Rotterdam Central Railway Station and the 
adjacent neighborhood. The Central Station served as a meeting place for heavy drug users, 
alcoholics and other marginals since the middle of the 1970s. It is the only remaining open 
drug scene in Rotterdam and the center of the street dealing of methadone (especially on 
Fridays when methadone program clients get their take home doses for the weekend) and 
prescription drugs, such as the popular benzodiazepine Rohypnol. Some small scale street 
dealing of heroin and cocaine also occurs in this area. Because of factors relating to both the 
drug packaging (in contrast with drugs sold at house addresses, the drugs sold in this open 
scene are prepackaged) and the rushed atmosphere of a street drug sale, the consumer has 
much less control over the purchased product. According to well informed users, who have 
access to house addresses, heroin and cocaine bought at the Central Station are the worst buys 
in the city. Many users at the Central Station do not have access to or knowledge of house 
addresses, the most common setting for drug dealing in Rotterdam. Some users are 
temporarily denied entry to house addresses if they do not buy or are known to be in financial 
need. Other users are denied access more permanently. This is usually because their behavior 
and reputation does not conform to subcultural expectations. Among the permanently barred 
users, the most marginalized ones can be found. The other group using the Central Station 
market consists of drugs tourists. Korf et al. studied heroin tourists in Amsterdam, a city with 
an international reputation for drugs tourism. They found that most of their subjects (N= 382) 
came from Germany (35%), Italy (21%), the United Kingdom (10%) and Spain (7%). To 
their surprise, they only found a small percentage of French (3%) and Belgian (2%) heroin 
users, comparable with the percentage of North Americans (2%) (30, 31). In contrast, in 
Rotterdam, although no systematic research has been undertaken, it seems that the majority of 
drug tourists come from France and Belgium. They are mostly serviced by (both drug using 
and non using) French speaking Moroccans, who either sell them small quantities or guide 
them to house addresses, when larger quantities are desired (32). Few drug tourists have 
steady contacts outside the Central Station themselves.
<p>
At one side of the Central Station, throughout the day several low-threshold mobile 
methadone maintenance programs (modified city transport busses) dispense methadone to 
their clients. At the other side stands a small portable shelter where the, often homeless, 
visitors of the station can drink a cup of coffee or have a first contact with a social worker. In 
this shelter syringes are dispensed. 
<p>
The neighborhood adjacent to the Central Station has a long history of drug use and dealing. 
In the late 1970s the main street of this neighborhood provided a dense and large street 
copping area. In the early 1980s the police cracked down on this overt drug scene with the 
result that drug dealing spread over the older neighborhoods of town undergoing renovation. 
However there is still drug dealing in the neighborhood mainly indoors. Also in this 
neighborhood is a church, that runs a day shelter. This shelter is visited by people with drug, 
alcohol, housing and other problems. It offers such services as sanctuary, a cheap meal and 
initial help with social problems. Many steady visitors of the Central Station frequent the 
church shelter. 
<p>
The second research site is one of Rotterdam's oldest neighborhoods. Close to the center of 
town, the first building of this neighborhood stems from 1725. Hundred and fifty years later 
the neighborhood grew rapidly as a working class residential area due to an agricultural crisis 
and the rise of industrial and harbour activities in Rotterdam. Houses were cheap and the area 
became densely populated. Families lived from generation to generation in the neighborhood, 
often in the same street and houses. The neighborhood knew an intense social and corporate 
life for decades, e.g. many streets had their own social club. However, in the twentieth 
century, especially after the second world war, the quality of the housing rapidly deteriorated. 
In the 1960s and early 1970s many inhabitants who were in a position to leave, did so and 
they were succeeded by foreign laborers, students and squatters. Social life and relations 
drastically changed. In the Seventies the urban renewal began in the area. Although this 
improved the housing situation, it also meant an additional burden on the already weakened 
social structure (33).
<p>
In 1982 it became apparent that the use of hard drugs among neighborhood youth had risen 
rapidly and due to the above mentioned police activity in the original drug area of the Central 
Station, drug dealing entered the neighborhood and quickly multiplied. In some streets under 
renovation more than 10 dealing places could be identified and the police estimated that the 
total number of dealing and using places in the neighborhood was around 80. In 1982 the 
total number of heroin users living in the neighborhood was estimated at  250 (33). At the 
end of the 1980s the neighborhood began recovering from the urban renewal process, which 
was near completion. Although drug activities have decreased to a certain extent, there is a 
stable group of drug users living in the neighborhood. Many of them were raised in the 
neighborhood. Besides this group another, floating population of users, frequent the 
neighborhood to buy and use drugs and to socialize with friends at the house addresses. Some 
of them are dealing from time to time. Others live for shorter or longer periods in squatted 
houses or with friends that have legal housing in the neighborhood. 
<p>
<I>Gaining Access</I>
<p>
Once the research sites were chosen, the field research team, consisting of a community field 
worker (a respected post user) and the principal investigator, started hanging out at the 
Central Station and wandering through the streets of the second site. While doing so, old 
contacts with known users were reestablished and new contacts were made. The primary goal 
in this phase was to develop relations with high status users, (20) such as dealers and house 
address owners or with people that could introduce the team to these places. "For a successful 
research relationship to evolve, ethnographers must establish legitimacy both for their 
presence and for their intentions" (20). Therefore, trust, acceptance, and credibility are of vital 
importance. Both the community field worker and the principal investigator have worked in 
the drug field before and were known to be trustworthy. During informal conversations with 
drug users on their problems and life in the drug scene in general, the project's goals were 
discussed. Although many of the users were aware of the position of the researchers, this 
cannot be said of all the drug users that were observed in the course of the fieldwork. Often at 
busy house addresses where in the course of a few hours the composition of the premises 
would almost change completely the field researchers became almost invisible. A few times 
the principal investigator was suspected of being an undercover police officer. However, 
there were always one or more users around who could alleviate suspicions. These situations 
usually ended in laughter or an interesting conversation. 
<p>
Enduring relationships have developed with a considerable number of the study participants. 
This is an inevitable consequence of spending many hours with the participants and 
interacting with in a non-judgmental manner. Developing such trusting relationships can be 
seen as a sentinel for sound ethnography. It can, however, bring the researcher into difficult 
situations that cannot be anticipated. People often tell very intimate details about themselves 
and about their relationships with others. Gossip is frequent and the researcher must resist the 
temptation to offer opinions. Being a close observer, one witnesses the positive and negative 
elements of people.
<p>
In situations of need, the ethnographer is sometimes called upon to leave the role of 
participant observer and intervene. Such was the case when Harrie, one of the most important 
field contacts got into problems. Harrie had been using hard-drugs for about 23 years; 
methadone, heroin and primarily amphetamines (speed). During the time the research team 
was in contact with him, Harrie was almost always optimistic. Some months previously he 
began dealing heroin and cocaine and stopped using methadone and speed. Instead he began 
shooting cocktails of heroin and cocaine. The first months went alright. Later he started 
having problems; he was robbed twice, his girlfriend left him and his cocaine use escalated. 
Attempting to feel better Harrie continued using large amounts of cocaine but grew more and 
more depressed. Two days after we had given him our phone number, Harrie called asking us 
to come over. When we entered his room we found him in a deplorable state. We talked about 
his problems. His life seemed "one black hole" to him in which he was stuck. He seemed 
exhausted and had not eaten for days. When we offered him to buy some food he refused, 
saying a shot of cocaine would make him feel better. He almost begged several times for 
money to get some coke, but did  not consider cocaine to be a part of his problem. He agreed 
to go out and look for help. When we left, the fieldworker bought him some food; he ate it 
all. The following excerpt from that day's fieldnote documents this role change from observer 
to, in this case, case manager: 
<p>
<blockquote>First we go to his methadone program. The staff is surprised and somewhat 
embarrassed. Harrie is asked why he had not said he was feeling poorly. However, days before 
Harrie made an appointment for a talk with the program's psychiatrist. This appointment had 
been postponed. First it looks like the staff does not know how to handle the situation. One staff 
member asks me to phone the on-call psychiatrist. I ask "should I do that?" Then they call the 
crisis center for drug users where it is agreed that Harrie can stay until his psychiatric 
appointment. We escort him to the center where the intake clerk underscores that he can only 
stay until Monday, the appointment date.</blockquote>
<p>
Some of the research participants, enduring relations were developed with, became key 
informants. They provided important supplemental information and insights. All locations 
were initially selected through neighborhood exploration and information from key-
informants. At times, the research team accompanied participants on their daily rounds. In 
this way they also were introduced to new dealing places, using places, and private homes. 
During the fieldwork, some of the dealing places were closed down by the police. Although 
these busts caused some turmoil, they did not seem to have a significant impact on the 
availability of drugs. New places quickly opened, sometimes on the same day at the same 
address. Often the researchers were introduced to the owner of a (new) address by a key-
informant. By following the dynamics of the drug scene most of the neighborhood house 
addresses could be observed.
<p>
<I>Instruments and Data Collection</I>
<p>
The observations were structured using an observational protocol of endogenous and 
exogenous cues pertaining to the heroin rituals of injecting and smoking (chinesing or 
chasing the dragon). As the study was primarily concerned with the actual behaviors of the 
drug self-administration sequence (the preparation and ingestion of the drug, the use of 
paraphernalia, order/sequence, places, setting, time) and secondarily with demographics and 
other characteristics of the people performing the observed behaviors, the former are 
highlighted in the fieldnotes. Appendix A presents the protocol.
<p>
The observations were collected by carefully watching drug users perform their drug taking 
routines. Sometimes this was done while sitting a few meters from the observed person and 
sometimes while interacting with the observed person or another user. The contents of these 
interactions ranged from general conversation topics to specific discussions on the actual drug 
taking. Never were questions experienced as intrusive. Only on a few occasions written notes 
were taken while observing. In general, such note taking would be too intrusive. No 
structured interviews were conducted. When possible, additional information was collected 
from informal conversations. Other than providing an occasional sandwich or cup of coffee, 
no participation fees were paid. Detailed fieldnotes were recorded of 95 rituals. In 44 
observations, subjects were smoking; in two, subjects were snorting; and in 49, subjects were 
injecting. The observations were recorded in the afternoon (94 percent) and early evening (6 
percent). 93 percent of the observations were recorded at 14 different houses, where drug 
users live, deal drugs, or both. In 53 percent of the observations those houses were legally 
rented, in 9 percent they were subleased and in 38 percent squatted. The remaining observati-
ons were recorded in public places , a greenhouse, deserted sheds behind abandoned buildings 
awaiting renovation and on the streets.

<I>Data Processing, Coding, and Analysis</I>
<p>
Fieldnotes were produced independently by the researchers after each fieldwork session or 
the following morning, based on short notes generally taken immediately after the 
observations. The fieldnotes were processed on personal computers using WORDPERFECT 
word processing software (34), transformed into ASCII files and entered into the 
ETHNOGRAPH, a computer program for the analysis of qualitative data (35). Appendix B 
presents an overview of this procedure. In this program the qualitative data were numbered 
line by line and coded in concordance with the observational protocol. The codes evolved 
constantly during the data collection and concurrent coding process. The coding process was 
primarily the responsibility of the researcher. However, some data was also coded by the 
fieldworker and the supervising professor and sometimes jointly coding sessions of 
researcher and fieldworker were held. Analysis was performed by the researcher in a 
continuous consultation and discussion process with the fieldworker and the supervisor. 
Memos were exchanged on diverse aspects of the data, coding and analysis. These memos 
were the material of regular research staff discussions. In these meetings innovative ideas 
were brought up that enriched and steered the analysis to a great degree. During this recurrent 
process of data collection, coding and analysis the from the outset general research questions 
were increasingly specified, while new ones emerged. Although its formal procedures were 
not always exactly utilized, the project methodology shares many characteristics with Anselm 
Strauss' grounded theory analysis (36).
<p>
In order to complement the qualitative analysis, the data were quantified by counting 
significant events and by recording available demographic and background characteristics of 
the subjects. These data were stored in two separate SPSSX data files. The numbers presented 
in this thesis were generated through these quantifications and are intended to support the 
qualitative analysis. Drawn from a selected sample, they may not represent all drug users in 
Rotterdam, a common feature in studies of hidden populations.
<p>
In order to obtain information on the regular visitors of the Central Station, a survey was 
conducted. Every fifth visitor of the shelter adjacent to the Station was interviewed by 
indigenous interviewers who were trained by the community field worker. Sex and race of the 
interviewers resembled those of the C.S. population. In total 61 interviews were conducted on 
living conditions, social status and work situation, drug use, and time spent on the C.S. The 
data from the survey on the Central Station zone population have been used to supplement the 
data obtained from the observational protocols and cross-validate interpretations.
<p>
Where opportune Rotterdam methadone treatment data have been used. These data are 
collected in intake interviews and registered in the Rotterdam Drug Information System 
(RODIS). Most RODIS data stems from the yearly reports, except for those used in the 
secondary analysis in chapter seventeen. These were supplied by Drs. Jaap Toet of the 
epidemiology unit of the Rotterdam department of Health.

<I>Characteristics of the Research Participants</I>
<p>
The total number of research participants contacted was 192 --168 males and 24 females. 
Because no formal interviews were held not all the characteristics could be recorded. Hence, 
on the demographic variables, there are considerable missing data.  Of the ages that were 
recorded, some were known exactly but most were estimated by comparing independent 
fieldworker ratings. 30% were 25 years or younger, 50% between 25 and 36 and 20% over 35 
(N = 106). 
<p>
Figure 3.1
<p>
This distribution resembles that found in the Rotterdam registration system of heroin users in 
methadone treatment (RODIS) (27%, 60%, 13% N = 1797) (37). 45.7% of the participants 
are native Dutch, 26.9% are of Moroccan, and 23.7% of Surinam origin. 3.7% have their 
roots elsewhere (N = 186). For a minority of 23% injecting was the main mode of 
administration. 77% were smoking their drugs (N = 162). Although 72.6% of the chasers 
were 30 years or younger, and 60.5% of the IDUs were over 30 years (N = 95), the chasers 
outnumbered the IDUs in the group above 35 years by 57% to 43%. 96% of the research 
participants used both heroin and cocaine (N = 105). 
This pattern of combined heroin and cocaine use started in the beginning of the eighties when an increasing number of heroin users added cocaine to their menu.  That cocaine has become increasingly important to Dutch heroin users is cross-corroborated by the RODIS system where in the 1988 intake cohort a prevalence of 72 percent cocaine use is reported in the treatment population (37).  Over the following two years this percentage decreased somewhat and stabilized in 1990 at 68% (38).  Moreover, the fieldwork established that, 
at all house addresses and at the Central Station, both heroin and cocaine were available. 
Cocaine has become increasingly important to Dutch heroin users. A small group of older 
IDUs were also regular amphetamine injectors.
<p>
The survey held at the end of 1987 among the visitors of the shelter at the Central Station 
revealed figures, that in some respects are comparable and in others are somewhat different. 
There were less males in this sample (67%), the ages seemed somewhat lower (48% under 26 
years (although 15% being 25), 42% between 25 and 36 years and 10% over 35) and the vast 
majority were white Dutch. The distribution of injecting and chasing was, however, very 
similar; Only 23% injected heroin and 28% injected cocaine. The prevalence of cocaine use 
was 74%. This survey furthermore indicated that the large majority (75%) of this specific 
population is hanging around the Central Station more or less all day. Almost half (45%) 
visits the station to meet other people and one-fifth come because of the stationed methadone 
busses. Almost half (41%) uses and buys drugs at the station and dealing is not an infrequent 
activity (15%). Unemployment and unfinished education are main characteristics and one out 
of five is homeless. The main complaints that have been recorded are boredom, loneliness, 
absence of or poor housing and addiction.

<I>Representativeness</I>
<p>
This study reports in the first place on the drug users studied at the house addresses, private 
homes and public places in the two research sites. The results are, nevertheless, applicable to 
the larger population of users of heroin and cocaine. In particular to those who buy and use 
these intoxicants at house addresses or around the Central Station in Rotterdam. Although the 
drug scene in Rotterdam has some specific features, many aspects may well be comparable 
with those in other Dutch cities. 
<p>
A possible source of bias may be found in the selection of the research sites. In theory, it is 
possible that in other areas, different behavior can be observed. However, a number of 
observations were recorded in other areas of the city and the use of heroin and cocaine has 
also been observed outside of Rotterdam and even outside The Netherlands. These 
observations were not in contrast with the general picture that emerged from the data. 
<p>
The characteristics of the research participants may have biased the results in another fashion. 
When compared to recent studies of heroin users (both in and out treatment settings), it can 
be determined that the distribution of ages and administration rituals is rather similar (16, 27, 
28, 37, 39). Regarding sex, ethnic distribution and prevalence of cocaine use the sample 
diverges, in particular from treatment populations (28, 37, 39). These differences may well be 
explained by the unique design of the study --the observers were present where the action is, 
though not undercover, often unnoticed, ignored or even forgotten-- which did not require 
active or conscious cooperation of each participant. At the other hand, users that have others 
buy their drugs for them are excluded. 
<p>
As the majority of observations were conducted at places where these drugs are sold, the high 
proportion of minority users in this sample may be due to a larger presence at these places or 
a higher involvement in consumer level heroin and cocaine dealing (40). It can, however, not 
be excluded that the found distribution presents a more realistic image of the actual 
proportion of minority drug users, as they seem less willing to participate in (survey) research 
(17) and are probably underrepresented in drug treatment facilities (28). This latter suggestion 
is somewhat supported by the higher proportion of ethnic minorities that received methadone 
in custody at Amsterdam Police stations, (39) although this may also indicate that minority 
drug users are simply more often arrested (16).
<p>
The comparably low proportion of women in the sample needs a somewhat more elaborate 
explanation. It is sometimes assumed that female drug users are underrepresented in drug 
treatment programs (41, 42). Although the found distribution seems to contradict this 
assumption, this may not be the case. First of all, the low number of women is caused by the 
high proportion of ethnic minorities --the percentage of women is about three to six times 
lower in these groups (28). Further reasons for the low proportion of women in the sample 
may be similar to those put forward for their relative absence in treatment programs. In 
general, the drug scene, including the treatment programs is male oriented and driven. Female 
users may come less often to house addresses, because, if around, their husbands or 
boyfriends score the drugs, while they wait at home (and sometimes take care of children) for 
their partner to return with the drugs. Alternatively, independent women may use at other 
times and places than observed. For example, female users involved in sex work may 
frequent addresses, that only sell to sex workers. Nevertheless, the observations of the drug 
use rituals of women did not cause reason to assume that, within the two main rituals, women 
partake in conceptually distinct rituals (however, the functions and meanings for women may 
differ). 
<p>
The higher prevalence of cocaine use may also partly be explained by the high proportion of 
minority users, who use cocaine more often (16, 28). In addition, the subjects of the 
observations were all active users --they were caught in the act of using heroin and/or 
cocaine. As the level of heroin use is positively related with the use of cocaine, (17, 28) non-
users of cocaine may have been somewhat underrepresented at the house addresses --they 
come less often. At the other hand, participation in methadone programs decreases (the 
frequency of) both heroin and cocaine use (43). Methadone treatment data is thus not 
representative for active out-of-treatment users. 
<p>
Having taken these factors into consideration, it can be assumed that the study sample 
presents a rather fair representation of the population involved in regular use of heroin and 
cocaine in Rotterdam.

<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
In The Netherlands two predominant routes of heroin self-administration are prevalent with 
an uneven distribution; smoking and injecting. In this study 23% of the contacted drug users 
inject and 77% smoke their drugs. Several other Dutch studies mention similar prevalence 
distributions (1, 2, 3). From an ethnographic perspective these routes of administration when 
observed in their social context and meanings can be termed heroin rituals. Injection has been 
the predominate ritual among heroin users in Western societies while heroin smoking has 
been the most common ritual pattern in Eastern societies. However, there has been a process 
of continual crossover with Western heroin rituals appearing in the East and Eastern heroin 
rituals appearing in the West. 
<p>
The Netherlands provide a relatively unique social situation because both Western and 
Eastern heroin rituals appear and are relatively stable. Recently heroin smoking was also 
reported in the United Kingdom (4, 5, 6). The most common form of heroin smoking in the 
Netherlands is called chinezen (chinesing or chasing) by users, revealing its Eastern origins. 
In Hong Kong, this heroin smoking ritual is called chasing the dragon (7).
<p>
Injecting, which is the typical western heroin ritual, is in The Netherlands called spuiten or 
shotten. Shotten is derived from shooting, an American drug subcultural term for injecting. 
Spuiten is a relatively general term, that can just as easily be used in a medical as well as in a 
subcultural context. On the basis of sociolinguistics one might predict that chinezen would be 
considered a more deviant behavior, because it is associated with an exotic culture. However, 
the opposite is the case, where injecting mostly is preceded by chinezen in a drug use career. 
Heroin, and most other opiates, can be taken into the body in more, although less efficient, 
ways. Simple oral ingestion (mixed with food or drink or not), sniffing and smoking in a 
cigarette, all produce a high. Besides for economic reasons, these routes are not preferred by 
users because they produce a comparably low flash or rush (the initial physiological impact 
effect). In the following two sections a detailed description will be presented of chasing and 
injecting, the two most common administration rituals of Dutch heroin users. 
<p>
<a href="#her">Top</a>
<p>
<a name="chas"></a>
<b>Chasing Heroin</b>
<p>
The descriptive term chinezen (chinesing or chasing) refers to the behavior of trying to inhale 
the curling fumes of heroin vapor with a tube as the heated liquid heroin flows along a piece 
of foil. It is usually mentioned as a form of drug smoking. However, contrary to the logic of 
the word smoking, the drug is actually not smoked. Technically, when heated, the drug melts 
and subsequently vaporizes. The vapors are then inhaled. So the drug is not burned, causing 
smoke, like with tobacco. For practical reasons the term smoking will be used, as it is most 
common used. The following fieldnote presents a representative depiction of chasing:
<p>
<blockquote>With a small pocket knife she takes a knife tip of heroin from the paper package 
and puts it on the oblong strip of aluminum foil that lies in front of her on the table. She takes 
the foil in her left hand and with her right hand she puts a tube with a length of  7 cm and a 
diameter of  0.5 cm in her mouth. With the same hand she takes the disposable lighter from the 
table and lights it. Before holding the flame under the foil she checks the height of the flame. 
Then she bends a little over and brings the foil at approximately 10 cm from her mouth, a little 
tilted and parallel to her body. The end of the tube is now  1 cm away from the little pile of 
light brown powder on the foil, slightly behind it. Simultaneously, she carefully positions the 
lighter, so that the top of the flame is  1 cm under the foil where the heroin lies. The heroin 
powder melts, turns into a dark reddish brown drop and starts to run slowly along the length of 
the foil leaving a brown track behind. With the tube she carefully follows the drop and inhales 
the fumes that curl up from the heated liquid. When the drop approaches the end of the foil she 
stops heating it, while continuing to inhale for a second. The drop solidifies and spreads out a 
little. She puts the foil back on the table and takes the tube from her mouth. After about 10 
seconds she exhales.</blockquote>
<p>
This fieldnote shows several important features of chasing heroin. In order to chase heroin 
one needs, besides the drug, certain distinctive paraphernalia, such as a knife, aluminum foil, 
a lighter, and a tube-shaped pipe. Furthermore, one needs the knowledge and skills to use 
these tools in the required manner. Some of these need special preparation. Finally, there are 
some requirements for the place where chasing takes place. 
<p>
Both chasers and IDUs habitually carry knives. Although some users may think of their 
knives as a status symbol or weapon for self defense or robbery, they will find themselves 
using it mainly in handling drugs. A dealer uses a knife to scoop the drugs from his stash into 
the balance or to eyeball the smallest sales unit, a halve streep (a half stripe =  0.05 gram) at 
the point of the knife.  With a knife the user takes the heroin out of the package and puts it on 
the foil or, when injecting, in the spoon. The primary function of knives is instrumental in the 
process of drug use. Therefore, most of the observed drug users use a small, easy to handle 
pocket knife. Only once a large, dagger type, knife was observed in the process of preparing a 
considerable amount of cocaine for smoking. In contrast, the blade of the smallest knife 
observed measured only 3 cm. When a knife is unavailable, users may turn to less preferable 
alternatives, such as a screw driver, a dining knife or a stanley knife. But, pocket knives are 
favored as these are more appropriate in handling small quantities of the precious powder. 
<p>
The aluminum foil from which heroin is smoked is ordinary kitchen foil and can be obtained 
in any supermarket, where it is sold on roles of 25 meter x 30 cm. The common size of the 
smoking foil is  5-7 x 15 cm, which is half of the width of the roll. Chasers were observed 
just tearing off a piece of foil to have a quick chineesje. This happens often when they are in a 
hurry or in withdrawal. But frequently they put relatively considerable time in the 
preparations of the foil and also the pipe (see below). Then the foil is cut or torn neatly at the 
preferred size, and stretched and rubbed to take out the wrinkles. Before putting the drug on 
it, first the user heats the foil with a lighter until some vapors come off: 
<p>
<blockquote>He takes the role of aluminum foil that lies on the table, tears off a piece ( 15 by 
7 cm), heats it first, puts some heroin on it and starts chasing. </blockquote>
<p>
These vapors origin from a coating on the foil. Heating the foil prior to chasing is meant as a 
health precaution, preventing the inhalation of gasses suspected to be harmful. When regular 
aluminum foil is not available, users will look for alternatives, such as the foil from cigarette 
packs. However, not all brands are suitable; Pall Mall and Caballero are preferred. The foil of 
these brands is glued to a paper foil, but can be made easily into a smoking foil by burning of 
this layer of paper. Any other metal packing foil (e.g. from chocolate bars, sweets or other 
food products) will serve the purpose, as long as it is thick enough and can be used right away 
or made usable by simple action. 
<p>
The lighter is an important tool for a chaser. Although one young user was observed heating 
his foil with an expensive Dupont lighter, most smokers prefer a transparent disposable 
lighter with an adjustable flame. The flame that is needed to heat a spoon has to be rather big, 
but when chasing, the flame necessary to melt and vaporize the drug may not be too high, as 
the aluminum foil could be damaged or the drug could catch fire. It has to be disposable for 
more than one reason. Most lighters are not designed to stand heat for periods much longer 
than the time it takes to light a cigarette. When chasing for prolonged time the mechanism 
can be deranged or damaged by the heat. For that reason, chasers prefer disposable lighters 
that can be taken apart and then be readjusted beyond the standard range of the flame 
adjustment mechanism. Likewise, chasing takes a lot of gas and a chaser with an empty 
lighter has a serious problem. This also accounts for the preference for a transparent type; the 
gas level can be monitored and a new lighter can be purchased in time. 
<p>
The tube-shaped pipe is another important piece of equipment. In 1975, when chasing was 
just emerging as a heroin administration route, the author often observed (in particular 
novice) chasers using a rolled up 10.- bill to inhale the fumes. Since then, the genuine 
chasing pipe has developed into an ingenious piece of craftsmanship, although any tube-
shaped object, such as pens, straws or any rolled up piece of paper will do in emergencies. 
Normally paperboard or thick paper that keeps it's shape when rolled up is used. The 
preparation of a pipe (and a smoking foil) varies, depending on several factors. The time, 
concentration, and care put into the construction of a pipe seems to depend on variables such 
as craving, the availability of time and materials, the setting of use, as well as the skills and 
experience of the user. For example, a clear relationship between craving and the 
functionality and esthetics of the design can be observed. High craving mostly results in a fast 
made pipe. As one user said: "Don't care how it looks now, I'm sick, I need a smoke fast" and 
he tore off a piece of a magazine cover. In the following fieldnote two users rushed into a 
dealing place, bought a quarter gram of heroin and sat down at the table designated for using: 
<p>
<blockquote>The customer prepares for chasing. He does not have a knife and borrows one. 
With the knife he takes some heroin from the pack and puts it on his friend's aluminum foil. ... 
Then he makes a pipe of a piece of paperboard of  7 cm. His friend uses a rolled up packing of 
a cookie, which comes with a cup of coffee in a bar. He says they are in a hurry because they are 
sick, otherwise he would have taken more time to prepare a good pipe like the others at the table 
use. </blockquote>
<p>
The pipe this user refers to has a number of distinctive, prescribed specifications. It is made 
of aluminum foil, paperboard from a cigarette paper pack and a cigarette paper. In The 
Netherlands it is common to smoke hand rolled cigarettes and the slip of the cover of the 
cigarette paper ( 7 x 3 cm) has just the right format for a pipe. The cover slip is wrapped in a 
piece of overlapping aluminum foil. The overlaps are folded around the paper and then the 
whole thing is rolled up (e.g. around a pencil) so that the folds are on the outside. Finally the 
aluminum foil-covered pipe is rolled in a cigarette paper to keep it together. Users often make 
little pieces of art of their pipes. However the design is not just art for art's sake, but, as can 
be witnessed in the next excerpt, highly functional: 
<p>
<blockquote>Boris is chasing cocaine and heroin. When he has finished the dose on his foil, he 
opens up his pipe. It is made of aluminum foil, a piece of paperboard from a cigarette paper 
pack and a cigarette paper. The foil is carefully wrapped around the paperboard. Then it is rolled 
up with the foil towards the inside of the tube and kept together with a cigarette paper. It has the 
size of a filter cigarette. After taking off the cigarette paper, Boris folds back the foil. On the foil 
that was on the inside of the pipe is a light brown film of a heroin and cocaine mix residuum. 
First Boris constructs a new pipe like the old one. Then he chases what is left from the old 
tube.</blockquote>
<p>
The foil covered pipe has thus an important instrumental function. While inhaling the vapors 
through a pipe, some of the drug will deposit on the inside of the pipe, covered or not. 
However, when an aluminum foil-covered pipe is used, this deposit is 100 % re-usable 
without performing complicated procedures. It depends on the quality of the drug and on the 
smoking technique how big the deposit is. Observations indicate that this quantity may go as 
high as up to 40% of the drug vapors that have passed through the pipe. Users have a specific 
name for this deposit: 
<p>
<blockquote>The man looks into his pipe, he has put tin-foil inside. He says: "Let me see, how 
much interest there is inside".</blockquote>
<p>
Some users report they save the pipe to smoke the interest in the morning when they have 
neither drugs nor money. A few users are able to get their interest even out of a paperboard 
pipe. This, however, requires more skills: 
<p>
<blockquote>Some moments after the man finishes chasing the other takes his paperboard pipe 
from the table. He folds it open and puts it on a piece of aluminum foil. He carefully heats the 
paperboard so that it won't burn. This way the deposit of the heroin vapors runs from the 
paperboard on the foil. When he is finished he chases this bit. </blockquote>
<p>
It is clear that chasing is a complex practice that requires a distinguished level of knowledge 
and skills. This can also be observed in the smoking technique of users. Contrast the 
following fieldnote with that of the woman at the beginning of this chapter: 
<p>
<blockquote>On the first floor Jack is busy scraping out the last remains of heroin from a 
plastic sandwich bag. With his thumb he rubs the heroin from the plastic. Then with his knife he 
scrapes it of his thumb and throws it on a aluminum foil. He gives the foil to the blonde guy 
who starts chasing through a rolled up piece of paperboard. He does not heat the foil carefully 
and misses many of the fumes. </blockquote>
<p>
Experienced chasers dose the flame carefully and keep the end of the tube right behind the 
drop, as close as possible. Their lighter and tube move almost simultaneously. When the drop 
runs over the foil it leaves, depending on the cuts and impurities, a light to dark brown track 
behind. By adjusting the distance of the flame to the foil and the angle of the foil, the speed, 
path and number of tracks of the drop are influenced. 
<p>
<blockquote>He keeps the lighter very close to the foil, causing the heroin to burn quickly. The 
heroin drop makes only a short trail because of this. </blockquote>
<p>
The amount of vapors, the speed with which the drug runs across the foil and consequently 
how many chineesjes come out of each dose depend to a large extent on how much heat is 
added. 
<p>
Finally, the place where heroin is chased is of importance. Although people were observed 
chasing on the streets, the best results are obtained in a sheltered place, where wind cannot 
influence the vapors.

<b>Injecting Heroin</b>
<p>
Theoretically, there are three ways one can inject a drug: subcutaneous, intramuscularly and 
intravenously. Most injecting heroin users prefer intravenous injecting (mainlining) --the 
most direct way of ingesting any drug. The next fieldnote gives a good impression of the 
intravenous self-administration of heroin:
<p>
<blockquote>The man starts to prepare a shot. He puts his spoon on the table and throws in a 
knife tip of heroin. He adds some lemon juice and with his syringe he gets some water which he 
carefully squirts in the spoon, around the heroin powder just under the edge of the spoon. He 
heats the spoon and when the stuff has dissolved he stirs and draws the solution in the syringe 
through a piece of cotton. After checking the syringe for air bubbles, he puts his syringe on the 
table. Then he takes his belt and puts it around his left arm. Making a fist he pumps up his 
veins. He looks carefully at his arm and then sticks in the needle. When he pulls the piston back, 
blood immediately runs into the syringe. then he pushes the piston about halfway. Then he 
draws up some blood and pushes the mixture into his vein. He moves the syringe a little, draws 
 1.5 cc. blood and pushes it in again. All the time his hand is a fist. Then he unties the belt, 
pulls the needle out, puts it down and waits about two minutes, concentrating on the rush. 
</blockquote>
<p>
This observation shows that, as is the case with chasing, before heroin can be injected the 
user must perform a determined sequence of activities and in this sequence a number of 
prescribed paraphernalia and ingredients are essential. The paraphernalia that are necessary to 
prepare and administer a heroin injection are a knife, a lighter, a cooker, a filter, a syringe, 
and a tourniquet. Furthermore, specific ingredients are necessary, water and an acid. In the 
following, these will be discussed in the order in which they are generally used. 
<p>
Like chasers, IDUs use a knife to scoop the heroin from the pack and eyeball the dose, before 
putting it into the cooker. With only one exception, all the cookers observed were spoons, 
both diner spoons and tea spoons. The spoons are bent so that when put down they rest stable 
and level. Normally, first the heroin is put into the spoon followed by a little water and an 
acid. Water is an important ingredient for IDUs as it is necessary to dissolve the powder 
drugs. When available IDUs will generally take water from a tap. However, not all observed 
self-injections were administered at places with running water. When an injection is taken at 
a place without running water, like some squatted houses, the water is often stored in cups, 
bottles or a canister. IDUs that inject outside mostly carry a little bottle of water on them or 
fill a syringe with water, e.g. at the place were they bought their drugs but were not allowed 
to inject. Although some IDUs reported knowing other users that had used water from a water 
closet, a puddle or the gutter, this was not observed in this study. 
<p>
Dutch IDUs must use an acid to dissolve the base-heroin, which is designed for smoking. In 
the late 1970s, South West Asian base heroin was introduced in large quantities, substituting 
South East Asian heroin-HCl. First many IDUs had problems with cooking up this new sort 
of heroin as they did not know how to prepare it. However, soon the necessary knowledge 
spread. IDUs commonly use lemon juice in little, sometimes lemon-shaped, plastic bottles. 
Sometimes the juice from a fresh lemon is used. On a small basis the use of crystalline 
ascorbic acid was observed. In one of the networks observed, this was introduced by Harrie, 
one of the key-informants:
<p>
<blockquote>I learned to use it from a pharmacist in Limburg where I lived at that time. He told 
me it was safer to use ascorbic instead of fresh lemons or vinegar. He knew I was shooting 
because I always bought my syringes in his pharmacy. </blockquote>
<p>
Most users put in the heroin, acid and the whole amount of water at once. Others boil the 
heroin first with the (liquid) acid only or with only a part of the water:
<p>
<blockquote>After Mohammed has cleaned the cup with his jacket he puts in the heroin. Out of 
his jacket he takes a lemon and cuts it in two, keeps one half above the scale and by pressing it 
he puts a couple of drops of lemon-juice into the cup, enough to cover the Heroin that he put in 
just before. He then adds a few drops of water from the plastic bottle. "I first boil it with much 
lemon and little water, it dissolves better this way". He puts his lighter under the scale and boils 
the contents. </blockquote>
<p>
The reason for this preference is that the base heroin is believed to dissolve better in a strong 
acidic solution. When all ingredients are in the spoon, it is heated from the bottom, normally 
with a disposable lighter. IDUs seem less meticulous regarding their lighter than chasers as 
they only use them to cook the heroin. Sometimes other heat sources are used, such as stoves 
or, as can be witnessed in the next field observation, the alcohol swabs that are dispensed by 
the needle exchanges to clean the injection site prior to injecting: 
<p>
<blockquote>Back home Richard and Chris start preparations to shoot up. ... Richard puts the 
spoon in front of him and ... opens the heroin package, holds it above the spoon and empties it. 
He adds some lemon and water. Meanwhile Chris opens two injection swabs and puts them on 
the edge of the ashtray. When Richard is ready he nods, which Chris understands as a sign to set 
the swabs on fire with his lighter. This produces a flame from  4 cm high, above which 
Richard now holds the spoon to boil the contents. </blockquote>
<p>
In the argot of the Rotterdam heroin users injection swabs are sometimes called vlammetjes 
(little flames).
<p>
The time the mixture of heroin powder, acid and water is heated varies. In some observations 
the cooking took less than a minute, in others more than four minutes. This seems to depend 
on drug quality (particularly on the cuts), quantity of acid and also idiosyncratic differences. 
Some users boiled the drug mixture once, other users boiled it a few short times. Sometimes 
when not satisfied with the result, users add a little extra acid and, when necessary, water and 
boil it again. When the heroin is dissolved, the solution is given time to cool off a little, as 
injecting the hot liquid may cause intense irritation and pain. 
<p>
Subsequently, a filter is put in the spoon and through this filter the solution is drawn into the 
syringe. The most widely used type of syringe in The Netherlands is a 2 ml with a detachable 
needle (25Gx5/8" - 0.5x16mm). These are most popular and dispensed at most Dutch needle 
exchange programs. A minority of users prefers the 1 ml insulin type (27-28Gx1/2" - 0.36-
0.4x12mm). IDUs use several materials as filters; most commonly cotton wool. A little pluck 
is rolled into a ball. Another frequently used material is the filter from a cigarette:
<p>
<blockquote>He picks up a cigarette from the table and breaks off the filter. Then he tears some 
fibers from it and rolls them between his thumb and point-finger into a small ball, that he puts 
into the spoon. Ensuing, he takes the needle from his syringe and puts it in the needle cap. Then 
he puts the syringe on top of the filter, holding it with one hand and using his other hand to 
draw the plunger. </blockquote>
<p>
When these two materials are not available users resort to less preferable alternatives, such as 
a piece of tissue or clothing fibers:
<p>
<blockquote>Mohammed asks Abdul for a filter. Abdul says "I've forgot to buy cigarettes". 
"Well, then I have to do it like this" Mohammed responds, and he pulls some lint from his 
socks, rolls them into a small ball and puts it in the solution. </blockquote>
<p>
Tissue and clothing fibers are less favorable because the former can easily fall apart and then 
the fibers may be drawn into the syringe and the latter may be dirty; both causes for, at 
minimum unpleasant, infections. Now the injection is ready for use. However, some 
persnickety users are not satisfied yet: 
<p>
<blockquote>When the spoon looks empty, Doug adds some drops of water. He puts the 
syringe back on the cotton-ball, pushing lightly, and drives the ball through the spoon gathering 
the last remainings. He stops in the middle of the spoon and draws the plunger again, emptying 
the spoon finally. After finishing this he picks up the spoon and checks it for remnants. 
</blockquote>
<p>
Now the solution is in the syringe, it is checked for air bubbles, which are expelled by tapping 
the barrel. When finally everything is ready for the injection, most users use a tourniquet to 
bring the veins to the surface. IDUs were observed using belts, ropes, electrical wires and 
medical devices especially designed for this purpose. Before the injection site (mostly one of 
the arms) is tied off, often some exercise is undertaken; bending and stretching the arm 
rapidly, swinging it around or making a fist. Sometimes users rub and tap the injection site. 
These actions are all intended to make the veins swell to the surface:
<p>
<blockquote>Freek used the same electric wire as Harrie did. He tied it around his right arm and 
searched for a vein. With his forefinger he palpated his skin. He seemed tense. It took him some 
time to locate a suitable vein and more than once he took up the syringe but put it back on the 
table again because he was not sure. He changed the wire to his other arm and repeated the 
procedure. Then he found a good spot and pushed in the needle. He drew up some blood and 
pushed the piston down, then he drew up some blood again, pushed again and repeated this 
sequence several times.  When he finished he rubbed some Hirudoid ointment on the needle 
wound. </blockquote>
<p>
Not all IDUs use a tourniquet. They have veins that are thick enough or just under the surface 
of the skin, to hit easily, without tying them up. Richard presents a good example:
<p>
<blockquote>Richard sits down on the sofa to take his shot. Richard doesn't have to tie off his 
arm. Chris says he's jealous of Richard's veins; Kabels he calls them. Richard hits the vein he 
wanted to use in one try and presses the contents out of the syringe into the vein without 
interruption. ... After booting two times he takes the syringe out of his arm, opens an alcohol 
swab and puts it on the injection site. </blockquote>
<p>
The argot word kabels (cables) signifies the importance for IDUs of the condition of the 
veins. Some users have great problems hitting a vein, even when using a tourniquet. Such 
was the case with Chris, Richard's running partner:
<p>
<blockquote>Chris needs much more time and efforts to hit a vein. First he tries his left hand. 
With a belt he ties off his hand. The belt is placed around the under arm. With his other hand he 
taps upon the intended injection site to swell the veins. Then he inserts the needle, pulls back the 
plunger and looks into the syringe to see if blood is entering. It is not. Chris moves the needle 
under the skin probing for a vein. Three times he pulls up the plunger but without success. After 
the third attempt he pulls out the needle and puts it down. With toilet paper he cleans his hand 
because there is a lot of blood on it. Then he starts again at about the same spot, but again he 
fails. Now he tries his left underarm. He first puts the belt higher around his under arm. He 
inserts the needle and moves it around under his skin. Pulls up the piston but fails again. He 
takes it out and puts it back in again, some 2 cm from the last spot. Again a failure. He takes out 
the syringe again and cleans his arm from the blood. There is also some blood in the syringe. "I 
have to hurry now otherwise my needle gets clogged". He now tries his right arm, at the wrist 
on the inside, near where normally the pulse is taken. He puts the belt around his right 
underarm. Before he sticks the needle in, he first looks closely to see how the veins run under 
his skin. He thinks, considers and then tries again. Finally he has a hit and takes of the belt right 
after. Then he wants to boot, which isn't easy to do at this spot. Only with much trouble he can 
manage to do it. Now he takes out the syringe, takes a swab from the table and cleans the spot. 
The whole operation took him about 6 minutes. </blockquote>
<p>
Six minutes may seem like a long time for one injection. However, during the fieldwork users 
were observed that were sometimes busy for more than an hour, trying to inject. In the last 
three fieldnotes two additional aspects of the injecting ritual are observed. The first is, that all 
users were booting (drawing blood back into the syringe and reinjecting one or more times). 
Booting is a common practice among the injecting research participants. However, a pattern 
could not be distinguished in this behavior. Sometimes, users boot and at other times they do 
not. The second aspect that these three fieldnotes indicate is that many IDUs take an interest 
in maintaining their health status. One uses Hirudoid ointment, a topical preparation for the 
prevention and treatment of embolisms and other venous damage, and the others use alcohol 
pads, although not prior to injecting.

<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
Most heroin users, both chasers and IDUs, have developed quite fixed sequences of drug 
ingestion during their careers. In the foregoing, it is demonstrated that these sequences are 
subject to a great deal of patterning and stylization; important conditions for ritualization. A 
heroin user, when observing another user at any point in the drug administration sequence, 
will definitely know what has preceded and what comes next. He will probably have a good 
sense of what the observed person is thinking and feeling and the observation may even elicit 
similar thoughts and feelings. 
<p>
These stereotyped patterns are, partly, dependent upon the setting in which the drug taking 
takes place. There is inevitably a big difference between shooting up in a back alley and at 
home, or smoking heroin in a group at a house address. The Rotterdam heroin scene is 
characterized by a relatively calm climate and most drug use and dealing is located indoors. 
However, it is not only the setting of drug use that influence the patterns of ingestion. The 
drugs themselves can play a role also. This becomes apparent when investigating the use of 
cocaine among the heroin users in this study, which is the subject of the next chapter.

<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
The history of cocaine use in The Netherlands can be traced to the end of the nineteenth 
century. As in many other countries at that time, cocaine was an important ingredient of many 
of the, so called, patent medicines or specialits used for self medication in traditional folk 
medicine of the lower classes. However, cocaine was also used in higher social classes and by 
practitioners of medical and para-medical professions. By the year 1912 the number of 
cocainists was estimated to be higher than the number of morphine users (1). Besides being a 
consumer country, The Netherlands played a major role in the production and distribution of 
cocaine. The coca leaf grown in the Dutch Indies was of higher quality than those from South 
America. In 1911 The Netherlands were, with a world market share of 22%, the most 
important cocaine producer in the world (2). During the First World War the production of 
coca-leaf in the Dutch Indies decreased but soon after the war the production increased again 
very rapidly. In this period, a strong increase in the number of cocainists in Europe occurred 
(3). Although officially all the cocaine manufactured in The Netherlands was solely for 
medical purposes, in 1922 the Dutch production alone was sufficient for the world demand 
for medical purposes as was the combined export of Bolivia and Peru. However, cocaine for 
recreational use was in these days distributed through medical channels by which the medical 
demand seemed much larger than it in reality was (1).
<p>
Apart from the use of alcohol, the recreational use of (illegal) drugs in The Netherlands 
became popular in the late 1960s and early 1970s. At this time the availability of cocaine was 
still very limited. In the early 1980s cocaine became more readily available in The 
Netherlands and it became very popular in some discotheque- and nightclub-circuits of the 
big cities in the Randstad (the large urban complex of Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam 
and Utrecht). In the media, cocaine had the image of a safe drug and among some drug 
treatment professionals it was also viewed much less problematic than heroin (4). As it was 
very expensive ( 250.- a gram), it was seen as a jet set drug. In the course of the 1980s, 
cocaine use spread throughout larger segments of Dutch society. A 1988 E.C. pilot 
epidemiological study reveals some distinctive cocaine using groups with little overlap. 29% 
were actors and artists, 21% blue collar workers, 18% students, 18% unemployed, 7% white 
collar, 4% pimps and prostitutes and 4% were people with restaurant, bar and cafe 
occupations (5).
<p>
In the early 1980s cocaine use grew rapidly in the heroin scene. Already in 1981 in many 
places on the Kop van de Zeedijk in Amsterdam (at that time a main heroin copping area in 
Amsterdam) heroin and cocaine were sold together. However, a considerable number of users 
had prior experience with cocaine. 41% of client intakes of the Amsterdam methadone bus in 
1979 used cocaine. In 1987/1988 this had increased to 77%, while in 1989 this was 73.2% 
(6). Unfortunately, frequencies and (daily) doses are unknown. It is therefore unclear whether 
this early cocaine use was incidental or part of a regular pattern. As a consequence of their 
dominant position in the lower levels of heroin dealing, the Surinamese heroin users were the 
first group in the heroin scene that became heavily involved in the use and dealing of cocaine. 
Indicators of arrest statistics from the Amsterdam police and of intake data from a Rotterdam 
low threshold methadone program for ethnic minorities, suggest a steady rise of cocaine use 
and dealing in this group through the years 1983-1985 (e.g. in 1984, of 612 cocaine-related 
arrests, 41 % concerned Surinamese, 33 % were Dutch, 4 % Moroccans, 9 % Germans, 2 % 
Americans and 11 % others) (7).
<p>
A number of snowball sampling studies conducted in Dutch cities support the hypothesis of 
an increasing prevalence and preference of cocaine among heroin users in The Netherlands. 
Studies conducted in Amsterdam (8, 9) and in Rotterdam and Utrecht (10) on selected 
subpopulations of heroin users (foreign origin, prostitutes) showed about a 60 % prevalence 
of cocaine use. A further study of cocaine use in Rotterdam confirmed a coprevalence of 
cocaine and heroin in various milieus, suggesting a high prevalence of cocaine use among 
heroin users in general (5). In the present study 96% of the research participants were using 
both heroin and cocaine. Cocaine seems to have become a drug of choice for many heroin 
users in The Netherlands. This is in contrast with the situation before 1982, when it was more 
or less seen as a frill, or a matter of secondary importance.
<p>
Like many other drugs, cocaine can be taken into the body in a number of ways. Via the 
mucous membranes of the stomach (swallowing), the nose (sniffing), or genitals (rubbing), 
by smoking or inhaling the fumes when heated and by injecting. Oral use of cocaine has a 
very mild effect and is for that reason hardly practiced. For that matter, during the first half of 
the 1980s, Peruvian mate de coca, or coca tea was sold over the counter in the U.S.A.. Each 
tea bag contained about five milligrams of cocaine. After publications in the scientific press, 
the tea was outlawed (11). Sniffing, absorbing cocaine hydrochloride through the nasal 
mucous membranes, seems to be the most common mode of administration in so called non 
deviant users (12).
<p>
To understand cocaine use among heroin users, one has to start off with a basic understanding 
of the ritualized patterns of heroin use. In The Netherlands, these patterns were subject to a 
subcultural development of 20 years, starting around 1972. Cocaine use may be conceived as 
being nested in these heroin taking rituals. These heroin rituals were, however, developed for 
heroin use and, as will be demonstrated in the following pages, were less appropriate for 
cocaine consumption. In the succeeding sections the effects of the nesting of cocaine in 
heroin self-administration rituals will be presented.

As crack (commercially fabricated cocaine base) is almost not available on the illegal drug 
markets in The Netherlands, cocaine smoking heroin users normally prepare the product 
themselves. In order to smoke cocaine, the Dutch user must first process the cocaine-
hydrochloride he bought at a house address to its precursor base form. This seems preferable 
to the users as then they have more control over the product they will smoke. In order to 
prepare this home-made crack, one needs some additional tools and home chemicals, such as 
a spoon, some tissue or toilet paper and a base like aqueous ammonia or baking soda (sodium 
bicarbonate) and a little water. At many dealing places spoons, ammonia, tissue or toilet 
paper and water are supplied by the dealer as is aluminum foil to chase. The spoon is usually 
a teaspoon, often bent, so that when put down on a flat surface it stays steady and level. The 
ammonia or bicarbonate is used to separate the hydrochloride group from the cocaine base. 
The tissue or toilet paper is used to dry the cocaine base when processed. The knife is used to 
extract the base from the solution in the spoon. 
<p>
Given the necessary equipment, the user is ready to start preparations. First the pakkie 
(wrapper) will be opened and with the tip of the knife an amount of the cocaine will be put 
into the spoon. Then the processing can start:
<p>
<blockquote>She cleans a tea spoon that lies in front of her, puts in the cocaine and adds a little 
ammonia. She heats the spoon with a lighter, but doesn't boil the content. Then she puts the 
spoon back on the table and picks up her knife, cleans it on her skirt and sticks it carefully into 
the cocaine and ammonia solution several times, meanwhile turning the knife so the depositing 
cocaine forms a lump around the top of the blade. Then she dries the lump, still on the blade, in 
a tissue and breaks it from the blade. </blockquote>
<p>
Most users prefer to use ammonia as this is the easiest and fastest mode. The ammonia comes 
in commercial household bottles containing 0.5 liter. A small hole is made in the cap to 
secure a careful dosing when dripping it in the spoon, preventing overfloating and wasting the 
substance. Other users prefer to use bicarbonate, mainly because they regard it as a safer 
means than ammonia, as the preference for bicarbonate is generally explained in terms of the 
health consequences of inhaling ammonia vapors:
<p>
<blockquote>"Ammonia bites, salt cleanses."
<p>
"No never, it's too dangerous. You never know how much ammonia stays behind and how 
much you get in while smoking. That's why I always use maagzout (=bicarbonate)." 
</blockquote>
<p>
While bicarbonate is safer it requires a more skilled hand as it must be carefully dosed and 
takes slightly more time. Furthermore, not at all deal places (e.g. in some squatted houses) 
water is readily available. Some users have developed an idiosyncratic preparation ritual, like 
Henry, who likes to use both ammonia and bicarbonate: 
<p>
<blockquote>With a knife Henry took out  1 stripe (0.10 g) of Cocaine and put it in a 
teaspoon. He then poured a little ammonia in the spoon and then he added a little salt. "Adding 
a little salt to the ammonia gives the best results, I think." ... He then boiled the solution firmly 
and it looked as if there was no base left over but when he took his knife and tipped the surface 
of the liquid the base cluttered to the knife-tip and formed a 'good' lump. </blockquote>
<p>
When ammonia is used, it is carefully dripped into the spoon. If bicarbonate is used, first a 
small amount ( 1/3 of the cocaine powder) of the powder is put in and next the spoon is 
filled with some water, often by dripping it off a finger. 
<p>
Next the spoon is heated so the chemical reaction between the hydrochloride group and the 
base can take place. This is mostly done with a cigarette lighter. Sometimes a candle or a 
turpentine burner is used as the lighter can get very hot because it is on for a longer time than 
is necessary to light a cigarette. If these are used, it is by the dealer or the owner of the 
dealing place, as users do not carry these bulky paraphernalia around. Some users heat the 
solution until the base clusters into an oily drop, floating in the liquid, while others cook the 
solution firmly until the drop seemingly disappears. Then the user takes his knife and tips the 
drop or the surface of the solution carefully, often turning the blade of the knife each time. 
The cocaine base then deposits on the tip of the blade, forming a lump. A small pocket knife 
is preferred, but any metal tool will suffice. By looking at the solution against the light some 
users check if any base is left in the spoon. When the lump has congealed most users dry it 
with a piece of tissue or toilet paper. At this point some users perform an extra action meant 
as a health precaution: 
<p>
<blockquote>After the lump has formed on the knife ... he takes the knife with the lump and 
holds it close to the ground. Then he pours water from the lemonade bottle over the lump to 
rinse out the ammonia rests. </blockquote>
<p>
Other users rinse the base in a glass, while it is still on the knife tip or put the lump in a spoon 
with clean water and boil it again. Finally the lump is broken off the knife and ready to 
smoke.
<p>
<I>Cocaine Smoking: Varieties of Vapor Inhalation</I>
<p>
Cocaine can be smoked in various ways; in cigarettes or coke joints, from aluminum foil and 
based in specially designed or customized base pipes. As with heroin, the drug is not burned, 
but melted and vaporized. The vapors are inhaled. 
<p>
A coke joint can be made in several ways. Often an ordinary cigarette is used. Some of the 
tobacco is taken out and the powdered cocaine is put in and shaken through the tobacco. In a 
hand rolled cigarette the cocaine is spread over the tobacco and then the cigarette is rolled. In 
this case it is sometimes mixed with marihuana or hashish. Sometimes cocaine hydrochloride 
is used. This is however, a very inefficient and expensive way of taking the drug, mostly done 
occasionally by sniffers, who are often not aware of the technique of preparing cocaine base. 
The effect does not differ very much from sniffing besides a little defeaning of the tongue and 
the, by many users appreciated, sweet caramel-like taste of the fumes (which may result from 
diluents). In fact, most of the cocaine decomposes into inactive components. This method is 
considered a waste by experienced cocaine smokers, such as heroin users. Although much 
more effective than smoking cocaine hydrochloride, smoking the base form in cigarettes still 
is a relatively moderate, inefficient and expensive way of ingestion. Within the heroin scene, 
this relatively rare cocaine smoking mode is more prevalent among novice cocaine smokers 
and among dealers who have a steady access to large quantities of the drug; among the 
sample of heroin users this was not observed. During the fieldwork a cocaine smoking 
middle-level heroin and cocaine dealer was contacted who did not use heroin. He claimed that 
the coke joints he smoked contained up to 2 grams of cocaine. When smoking a coke joint, 
the cocaine base melts and tends to stick to the inside of the cigarette paper. Therefore, most 
users constantly moisten the cigarette paper to prevent the loss of fumes when not inhaling. 
This is also done when smoking heroin in cigarettes.
<p>
Chasing was the dominant route of ingestion for heroin in the research group and this was 
also the case for cocaine. Chasing heroin was practiced before cocaine entered the heroin 
scene and acted as a model for non injecting heroin users, who started using cocaine. Heroin 
users chase cocaine in a number of ways; pure, often alternated with heroin and mixed with 
heroin. There appears to be a functional relationship between cocaine and heroin for both 
smokers and IDUs that will be discussed in chapter seven. However, cocaine and heroin are 
also smoked together for directly observable instrumental reasons. It requires more skills to 
chase pure cocaine than heroin. In the following example from a fieldnote, both users smoke 
pure cocaine from aluminum foil: 
<p>
<blockquote>The Surinamese man puts (the cocaine) on the foil and after heating it first to filter 
out the ammonia vapors he starts chasing. He says he does not need een kleurtje (a little color) 
to follow the liquid but he misses a lot of the cocaine base fumes. Boris (the dealer) also smokes 
the cocaine without heroin but he is doing better. </blockquote>
<p>
Cocaine is harder to chase for a number of reasons. It is colorless when liquid and therefore 
harder to follow. For that reason users often add a little heroin to the cocaine. This little 
amount of heroin is called een kleurtje which means a little color. It is meant to color the 
colorless cocaine base liquid which then becomes transparent light brown and easier to chase: 
<p>
<blockquote>After he has smoked 2 chineesjes pure base ... he now adds heroin to it. He says 
he does it for het kleurtje but also to stay relaxed. </blockquote>
<p>
When chasing pure cocaine one also needs to dose the flame more carefully:
<p>
<blockquote>She heats the foil carefully so that the flame does not touch the foil. This way the 
cocaine drop slowly runs over the foil. </blockquote>
<p>
When heated less cautiously, the liquid cocaine base has a very low cohesion and behaves 
very capriciously on the foil: 
<p>
<blockquote>With his fingers he breaks the lump off the knife and puts some pieces on the foil. 
From his pocket he takes a tube and starts to chase the cocaine base. He follows the drug 
carefully on the foil. However, the cocaine follows a very whimsical trajectory on the foil. The 
drop splits up several times and when he stops heating the foil it spreads into a large spot. After 
exhaling he starts again but he first chases the offshoots of the spot to make it into one drop 
again. </blockquote>
<p>
Heroin is much more cohesive. Therefore it does not only tone the base, but it also produces a 
more cohesive mixture; it tames the white dragon and makes it easier to chase. The following 
example depicts that quality of heroin: 
<p>
<blockquote>He puts some heroin on a foil and starts chasing. The heroin powder melts into a 
drop and then runs along the foil. In contrast with coke, the heroin drop stays very cohesive and 
runs smoothly and steady on the foil leaving a light brown track behind. </blockquote>
<p>
The rationale of these behaviors is confirmed by laboratory simulations of chasing. Most 
illicit heroin is much less volatile than cocaine base. Mixing the two substances decreases the 
volatility of cocaine, while increasing that of heroin (13).
<p>
Besides chasing cocaine, many users were observed basing cocaine. Basing is the most direct 
and efficient smoking mode, producing a rush (impact effect), comparable with, and 
according to some authors even more rapid and intense than injecting (14, 15, 16). Chasing is 
also efficient, but a much more moderate way of ingestion. When a certain amount of cocaine 
base is chased, it may take five to ten runs of the drug along the foil, depending on the 
(heating) technique. Each run accompanied by inhalation of the vaporized product through 
the tube. When the same amount of cocaine is based, the vaporized substance is ingested in 
one or two inhalations.
<p>
Compared to chasing, basing does not only produce a more intense impact effect, it is also a 
very expensive mode of administration and for that reason, often reserved to dealers who 
have a much higher availability of the drug than the average user. Apparently, when cocaine 
initially became available in the heroin scene, among the first users that started basing were 
Surinamese heroin dealers who, through their contacts and financial means, got easy access to 
cocaine in a time when it was relatively still very expensive. Basing cocaine became a status 
symbol in their specific scene at the time. After this initial phase, many heroin users, both 
smokers and IDUs were introduced to basing at Surinamese house addresses. Although in that 
period the prevalence of cocaine use among heroin users was much lower then nowadays, 
there was a high prevalence of basing among users who started using cocaine (7, 17). During 
the 1980s cocaine became more and more available and cheaper in the heroin scene. An 
increasing number of heroin users added cocaine to their drug taking repertoire. Somewhat 
simultaneously the prevalence of basing seems to have decreased, not meaning that users 
stopped basing cocaine altogether, but that they combine it with their preferred administration 
ritual (18, 19). Thus, IDUs will normally inject cocaine and sometimes they may base the 
drug. Likewise, chasers will generally smoke cocaine from aluminum foil and now and then 
base the drug. 
<p>
However, during the fieldwork the prevalence of basing among chasers seemed to be rising --
a sudden increase in basing was witnessed at house addresses. In that period the prices of 
both heroin and cocaine were going down. Besides the price level and the stronger impact 
effect, group dynamics also seemed to play a role in this rapid rise. One user gave the 
following explanation for the observed wave of basing:
<p>
<blockquote>I'm smoking coke from the glass for about three weeks or so. It gives a much 
better bang than chasing the coke. Now many guys are smoking from the glass. It's a kind of 
fashion whim. About three weeks ago someone started to smoke from the glass and told others 
it gave a great kick. Others tried it too and that is how the ball started rolling. </blockquote>
<p>
Basing requires the same preparations as chasing. The difference is in the apparatus that is 
used in smoking; the cocaine base is put in a pipe: 
<p>
<blockquote>Fred took the cocaine lumps and started smoking the base in a glass water bong. 
This bong is designed to smoke cannabis. It had a picture of a cannabis shrub on it. ... Fred put a 
lump in the head of the pipe, put the mouth piece to his mouth and then heated the base, dosing 
the flame carefully. He first drew the pipe full of smoke and then he released the air hole and 
inhaled all the smoke. He repeated it until it was finished. He then sat back, closed his eyes and 
laid his head against the back of the sofa. </blockquote>
<p>
All kinds of self-constructed or commercial pipes like hashish pipes, water pipes designed to 
smoke hashish and freebase pipes (with or without water/liquor) are used to smoke pure 
cocaine base. Designer pipes, such as in the last example, are not common as they are 
expensive, bulky and fragile and therefore not easy to carry around. Specially prepared water 
glasses were most often observed:
<p>
<blockquote>Around a little table near the door are sitting two creole Surinamese males, one is 
smoking cocaine in a base pipe. One of the Dutch men, Fokkie, is smoking cocaine from a 
glass. The glass is covered with aluminum foil. In the foil are little holes and on the opposite 
side is a larger hole. First he puts some cigarette ash on the little holes, on the ash he puts some 
small cocaine base lumps. Jack says that the ash is put on the holes to prevent that the melting 
cocaine base falls through the holes in the foil. "Now the coke is absorbed by the ash." With his 
lips Fokkie covers the larger hole, lights the cocaine base and inhales the smoke. On the table 
stands another smoking glass and also one on the dealing table. </blockquote>
<p>
The glass does not necessarily have to be a water glass. Any jar of about the size of a water 
glass will do. The main requirement is that it must be possible to cover the opening with a 
piece of aluminum foil:
<p>
<blockquote>From the table he takes an empty jar. He fills it half with water from the lemonade 
bottle and puts aluminum foil over the top. He sets the foil with a rubber. With his knife he 
carefully makes tiny holes on one side of the foil and a bigger hole on the other side to put his 
mouth on, to smoke. From the ashtray he takes some ash and puts some of it over the little 
holes. On top of it he puts the cocaine base, heats it with his lighter and smokes. </blockquote>
<p>
Subsequent observations in 1989, 1990 and 1991 have shown that cocaine basing has become 
increasingly important. Many users have turned to basing cocaine (mostly in little, self-
constructed pipes), while maintaining heroin chasing.
<p>
As explained above, the smoking of cocaine in The Netherlands is generally limited to 
smoking home-made crack. Although no extra cuts or fillers will be added during self 
processing, this product still contains the impurities and cuts that were in the cocaine before 
processing it into the base (20). In addition it may hold some of the processing chemicals 
(bicarbonate or ammonia). This product is different from free-base, cocaine base of almost a 
100 % purity. This purity is reached by refining the cocaine base of all cuts and processing 
residues in ether. Due to the superior purity the effect is even more potent. Because of the 
rather complicated and dangerous process (ether is a highly inflammable liquid) actual free-
base is rarely smoked by heroin users in The Netherlands.

<b>Cocaine Injecting</b>
<p>
Cocaine hydrochloride dissolves in water without the necessity of additional chemicals or 
heating. To inject pure cocaine, one does not have to go through much preparation and the 
preparation requires the least technique and tools as can be seen in the following fieldnote:
<p>
<blockquote>While discussing Alex had peeled out some cotton threats out of the lining of his 
jacket. Between his fingers he rolled a little ball from it. From his pocket he took a spoon and a 
little package which contained cocaine. He put the coke in the spoon with a little water and 
stirred it. Next he put in the little ball which he used as a filter. He drew up the cocaine and took 
the shot. </blockquote>
<p>
Although it dissolves without heating, cocaine is usually prepared in the same cooker as 
heroin. The cocaine is mostly stirred into solution with the safety cap of the needle, 
sometimes with the knife that is used to put the drug in the spoon. Often cocaine is combined 
with heroin in what is called a cocktail:
<p>
<blockquote>Doug starts to prepare a cocktail of heroin and cocaine. He puts some heroin in 
the spoon and adds some lemon juice and water. Then he boils the contents with his disposable 
lighter. When the heroin has dissolved he puts the spoon back on the table and waits a few 
moments. Then he carefully puts his fingertip in the solution in the spoon; "it's okay now", he 
says, referring to the temperature of the solution. He holds the package with cocaine above the 
spoon and with a knife from the table he pushes the cocaine out of the package into the spoon. 
When most of it is in the spoon, Doug scratches the package with the knife, so the last cocaine 
falls in the spoon too. He then stirs the cocaine through the heroin solution with the plastic 
needle-protector from his syringe. </blockquote>
<p>
At first glance, the nesting of cocaine in the self-administration rituals typical for heroin users 
may not seem to make much difference. However, as will be demonstrated in the next 
sections, the addition of cocaine did, in fact, have a significant and often negative impact on 
many aspects of the lives of the research participants.

<b>Varying Patterns of Cocaine/Heroin Use</b>
<p>
<I>A Comparison of the Effects of Heroin and Cocaine</I>
<p>
Agar distinguishes four effects of an intravenous injection of heroin: (21)<br>
1) The rush or flash is the initial physiological effect after the drug is injected into the body. It 
is sometimes compared to a driving force or an orgasm. 
<p>
<blockquote>"It's a very warm feeling that starts in one place and spreads. Probably that's 
where the similarity with an orgasm begins and ends".</blockquote>
<p>
The intensity of the rush varies with the administered dose and tolerance.<br>
2) The high is a feeling of general well-being and is longer lasting than the rush, the length of 
time varying with tolerance and dosage.<br>
3) The nod is usually described as a state of unawareness varying from light (dropping 
eyelids and jaw) to heavy (unconsciousness). A higher dose of heroin relative to the tolerance 
is necessary to produce the latter state.<br>
4) Feeling straight describes the state of not being sick, that is withdrawal symptoms are 
absent, without feeling the, as pleasantly described, high. 
<p>
<blockquote>"I'm not high, I just took the sick off." </blockquote>
<p>
Ameliorating the withdrawal symptoms is one of the main goals of the low dose methadone 
maintenance prescription in The Netherlands. As opiates are dependence forming, a fifth 
effect, withdrawal --feeling sick, can be distinguished when the drug has worn off. In terms of 
behavioral pharmacology the first four effects are positive reinforcers, while the fifth is a 
negative reinforcer (22).
<p>
When chasing the rush is much less apparent. The drug effect is, compared to injecting, 
slowly and moderately built up to the desired level. An IDU administers a certain dose in one 
injection while a chaser spreads the ingestion of the same dose over a much larger time span. 
The high and the nod are not different from those experienced when the drug is injected. 
Although nodding is not unfamiliar to chasers, it occurs much less often than when the drug 
is injected. When chasers do smoke themselves into a nod, this results from a much more 
gradual and time consuming process. Because of this gradual build up, fatal overdosing is, 
apart from inclement circumstances, unlikely when chasing (see chapter ten).
<p>
Cocaine and heroin are quite different substances and have rather opposite effects. Heroin is a 
downer, a suppressant, while cocaine is an upper, a stimulant. So cocaine does not produce a 
nod. Nevertheless, "[a]lthough many of the subjective effects are different, euphoria is a 
property that opiates share with cocaine and amphetamine" (23). Just as heroin, cocaine 
delivers a rush and a high. The rush, the most intense of these, so called, positive 
reinforcement effects of cocaine is induced by injecting and basing Chasing produces a 
milder effect. Compared to these modes, sniffing hardly produces a rush. The cocaine rush is 
often valued higher than that of heroin and qualitatively different. Some users stated that the 
heroin rush is more physical and the cocaine rush more cognitive. Such explanations may, 
however, for a large part be idiosyncratic. The cocaine high is also qualitatively different than 
the heroin high. Heroin produces a feeling of satisfaction, a warm blanket. Cocaine is said to 
give a feeling of extreme alertness and a perception of increased power and coping skills (24, 
25). Again caution must be emphasized, before generalizing such depictions, as the individual 
experience may vary considerably. While injecting and smoking cocaine produces an intense 
euphoric rush and a subsequent high, these effects are extremely short in duration ( 5 to 20 
minutes.) and, in particular in cases of chronic intoxication, often followed by a rebound or 
crash, an opposite state of intense dysphoria (26). Even heavy cocaine use does not seem to 
lead to intense physical dependence, as is established by chronic use of depressants, such as 
opiates, barbiturates, benzodiazepines and alcohol (23). It has, however, been questioned if 
the adverse state following discontinuation of (chronic/intense) cocaine use is solely 
attributable to psychological dependence. This crash may have a negative reinforcement 
effect (26).
<p>
Among the research participants, cocaine's extreme rush potential and the high are the main 
incentives for its use, but the drug's association with increased and persistent activity is 
likewise highly valued:
<p>
<blockquote> 15 minutes after he took a shot, Richard pours in the tea, while Chris is busy 
with dustpan and brush in the hall. "We always clean up right after the coke, then you have the 
energy and the lust to do it.", says Richard. </blockquote>
<p>
Some users rely heavily on this effect; to them cocaine may become the most important 
source of vitality: 
<p>
<blockquote>"A Surinam user told me he was sick, really sick as from heroin. If he hadn't been 
using coke he said to be feeling languid and weary. Taking white would pep him up he said, 
making him ready for the day." </blockquote>
<p>
<I>Various Cocaine/Heroin Combinations within the Ritual of Preference</I>
<p>
For both chasers and IDUs a variety of use patterns, involving taking cocaine pure or in 
different combinations with heroin, have developed. Whereas these patterns --turn taking 
(alternating doses of cocaine and heroin) or cocktailing (combining the two drugs in one 
dose)-- cannot be tight to specific individuals or groups, most users have developed a pattern 
of preference within one of the main administration rituals. Like Karel, who likes to shoot his 
cocaine pure, followed by an injection of heroin: 
<p>
<blockquote>Karel is shooting up cocaine. He puts the coke in the spoon, stirs, pulls it up 
through a piece of cotton and shoots the coke without using a belt. The rush makes him sweat 
very much. "It's an extreme flash it's very good coke.", he says, "I always first take the coke, 
cause I want to enjoy the coke-flash first." A little later I take the bruin. </blockquote>
<p>
Or this chaser, who likes to combine cocaine with heroin: 
<p>
<blockquote>The customer first puts some heroin on the foil and on top of it he puts some 
cocaine. "I like to smoke it this way, it's pleasing me the most if I smoke them together". 
</blockquote>
<p>
However, most users do not have a fixed consumption pattern. One moment they turn take 
cocaine and heroin and another they use the drugs in a cocktail. It simply is not always 
possible to stick to preferred pattern. Obviously, the available money is a very important 
factor: 
<p>
<blockquote>"When we have enough money we will buy 0.5 g cocaine and 'een kwart bruin' 
(=0.25 g heroin). That we put into one cocktail, so each has about a 'kwart wit en een streep 
bruin' (0.25 cocaine & 0.10 g heroin) per shot." </blockquote>
<p>
While other, primarily situational variables --such as the type and amount of the drugs 
already ingested (methadone), gifts, the time of day, available tools and physiological (habit 
size, withdrawal), psychological (mood or craving) and social factors (the present company 
and their objectives, motives, drives and expectancies)-- can also be seen to influence the 
patterns of use, the data suggests that availability (in terms of money and/or drugs) is a main 
factor. 
<p>
<I>Two Different Cocaine/Heroin Patterns</I>
<p>
Closer examination of the data on the cocaine use patterns identified two cocaine/heroin 
patterns with an uneven distribution. In the most common, cocaine is used for pleasure and 
heroin --to curb cocaine's side effects (see chapter seven)-- in similar quantities. In the 
second, less common, pattern the use of heroin is maintained at a minimum level, while 
cocaine use is much higher. Both patterns are also evident in the study of Grapendaal and 
colleagues Although they reported that most of their respondents prefer to use similar 
quantities of both drugs, they found a monthly mean use of cocaine (14.6 grams) which 
doubled that of heroin (7.7 grams) and attributed this to a few extreme users with monthly 
cocaine use maxima up to 140 grams (27). 
<p>
The observations and conversations with cocaine users strongly suggest that the latter pattern 
is more prevalent among the minority of users who do better than average in their specific 
hustle --the successful shoplifter or burglar, the most popular or top-poes (top pussy) sex 
worker on the stroll, and, most typically, the steady house address dealer. Pat, a 35 - 40 years 
old dealer using drugs for about 20 years explained the relationship between his occupation 
and his drug use:
<p>
<blockquote>"I use about a gram of 'bruin' now and a gram of 'wit', but when I'm dealing I use 
much more cocaine." </blockquote>
<p>
Doorman Jack explained the relevant reasons for heroin's lagging behind:
<p>
<blockquote>"When you're a doorman on an address, you're using more 'wit' (cocaine), I do. I 
don't have to be sick then (a doorman rarely is, as he's being paid by the dealer to screen 
visitors). Using more heroin then isn't making sense, more heroin gives more tolerance. It also 
makes it harder to stay not sick all day when I don't have a job as doorman. And, you don't feel 
it anyway (more heroin), a doorman has to stay alert. </blockquote>
<p>
The higher prevalence of the second cocaine/heroin pattern (much cocaine, little heroin) 
among dealing users is thus for a large part explained by the different pharmacological 
properties of the drugs and the relation of this difference to drug dealing. When employed in 
a dealing team, both heroin and cocaine are readily available --though not unlimited as 
dealers dislike overindulgent employees--, but Jack restrains from ingesting large amounts of 
heroin. Well aware of the uncertain nature of his employment, he anticipates periods of 
unemployment in which drug availability is much lower. Thereby he prevents unpleasant 
withdrawal experiences or having to resort to money raising activities below his (ethical) 
standards (27, 28). Cocaine's superior status as a pleasure drug may also add to this choice. 
But, maybe even more important, the specifics of the dealing setting promote the increase of 
cocaine use. To prevent loss of control of the dealing process (mistakes in weighing and 
financial transactions, rip offs, police busts or any other interference of the economic process) 
those involved in dealing must stay alert, perform their task accurately and constantly 
monitor the situation at the dealing place. This requires rather careful drug titration. In 
particular, too much heroin is contra-productive, as it decreases attention and results in 
reduced control over performance and the setting. In contrast, cocaine elevates alertness and 
is therefore tailored to the requirement of the job. As a result, cocaine use increases, generally 
both in quantity and frequency. 
<p>
Although both patterns may ultimately lead to some degree of cocaine related psycho-social 
problems, as described in the following section, the second pattern would especially seem to 
do so, as cocaine use is less compensated with heroin. Oddly enough, while the second 
pattern is more common among dealers and their total consumption is generally well above 
the average, they seemed to experience less problems. Cocaine related symptoms were not 
observed in stable dealers. In itself this seems a paradoxical finding, as it apparently 
contradicts the commonly held idea that psychological problems due to cocaine use are dose 
related (12, 29). It is a question, though, if this contradiction is real. Whereas dealing users 
may use considerably more cocaine, it does not mean that this is without limits or that they 
are not susceptible to cocaine related problems. This finding may thus merely mean that 
under the specific conditions of the dealing setting these users can consume more cocaine 
than their non dealing peers before experiencing these typical problems, and when such 
problems appear, they are apparently more successful in applying controlling procedures. 
<p>

<a name="use"></a>
<b>Consequences of Cocaine Use</b>
<p>
Problems due to heavy cocaine use are well known among heroin users. Physicians in 
treatment and methadone maintenance programs are more frequently confronted with 
cocaine-related symptoms and some of them are prescribing antidepressants and tranquilizers 
(7). Problems range from loss of control and craving escalation, individual psycho-social 
complaints to the collective disturbance it has on the structure of social interactions. While 
the state of intense heroin intoxication (the nod) has positive value for a considerable number 
of users, this is not always the case with cocaine. Irritability, extreme sensitivity to external 
stimuli, paranoid and delusional thinking, formication (coke bugs), and other unpleasant 
effects have all been related with heavy cocaine use (12, 26). At the other hand, 
discontinuation of use may lead to craving, tremor, muscle pain, eating disturbance, extreme 
nervousness, sleeplessness and social withdrawal, and rebound depression (26). As 96% of 
the research participants used both heroin and cocaine, almost all have experience with the 
negative sides of cocaine and it was a frequently mentioned subject. Many users furthermore 
report that quality of life has decreased since cocaine has entered the scene --mutual tolerance 
and support seem to decrease when cocaine is involved.
<p>
As explained above, when smoked or injected the desired effects of cocaine are highly intense 
but very short followed by an unpleasant rebound. To check or prevent this state and maintain 
the high, the drug is administered repeatedly over short time intervals. As a consequence of 
this practice, craving for cocaine can easily escalate: 
<p>
<blockquote>"There I go again with that coke, I just took a shot. Often the needle is still in my 
arm and I'm in the flash. But already I'm thinking about the next shot. You're so busy with the 
next one that you ruin the flash you're in." </blockquote>
<p>
This can lead to the consumption of enormous quantities of the drug. To maintain the high 
and prevent the crash, users end up binging (a binge is a prolonged period of heavy use) on 
the drug in administration schedules of twenty minutes or less, until the cocaine is finished:
<p>
<blockquote>"In the period that I was sitting in my kitchen all day shooting cocaine, I found the 
cocaine high delicious. But, the crash I found horrible and I would experience this crash within 
20 minutes. I was not using heroin in that period. Normally after a shot of cocaine, I would 
inject some heroin to avoid that jittery body feeling. But without the heroin, I just had to keep 
adding cocaine every, say, 17 minutes. Not so much to keep the high going but to stay one step 
ahead of the crash." </blockquote>
<p>
A binge is often heralded by a sudden rise in financial means, for example the result of some 
(mostly unplanned) criminal success. Such an event not only interferes with preceding 
comparably balanced use patterns, it may be the end of it (28) --a turning point in the career, 
ushering in a period of insatiable craving and resulting (extremely) high use levels of cocaine 
and heroin. Maintaining such high use levels requires large amounts of money, in the study 
group normally generated through involvement in the lower echelons of drug dealing or high 
levels of criminal activities. Billy, one of the research participants, explained that in one of 
his periods of high cocaine use, he was making money daily by following the mailman, 
observing where he mailed check books. Subsequently he lifted the check books (each 
containing 20 checks with a maximum of 200.-) out of the mailbox with an ingenious gripper 
and sold them to his fence for 1500.- each. Often he would start the day with 4500.-, buy 
cocaine and inject until it was finished. Although he sometimes is arrested, Billy succeeded in 
making the large amounts of money he required for his cocaine use on a regular basis. 
Normally he worked with a partner and than they formed a dyad (see chapter nine). 
<p>
<blockquote>A little later Billy's partner comes in. He lives at Billy's place and they make 
money and use together. He is 35 - 40 years old. He tells Billy has just been busted when 
stealing in into the Shell building. He clearly has respect for Billy's criminal skills. "Billy is a 
real crack, lots of guts, he just walks into every place. We make a lot of money, regularly we 
earn 5000 to 6000 guilders a week." </blockquote>
<p>
The opportunity to make such large amounts of money on a continual basis is, however, not 
evenly distributed. When engaged in heavy cocaine use without access to ample financial 
resources or when a profitable source suddenly dries up, many heroin users, who before 
exercised some degree of control over their use, lose all grip on their situation and get into 
problems in many different ways. 
<p>
During a binge often decisions are made that probably otherwise would not have been taken. 
In the words of Arie: "Cocaine steals the brains out of your skull, you keep on going" 
Everything becomes subordinate to the goal of maintaining the cocaine high. A considerable 
number of users will even neglect their heroin habit. That this is not an unusual occurrence is 
implicated in the following comment of a dealer:
<p>
<blockquote>"Many times I've seen users being sick from withdrawal and having only three 
'tientjes' (30.-) left. But they still buy 'voor twintig wit en een tientje bruin' (20.- cocaine, 10.- 
heroin). That's what they do when they are on coke." </blockquote>
<p>
Although they like the drug very much, not all users go that far:
<p>
<blockquote>"When ... I'm sick, I would always buy brown first. I just know, I need it not to get 
sick again later on the day. I'm not in a methadone program, so white is nice but it stays a matter 
of secondary importance. White is really a delicacy. But getting better in the morning (from 
withdrawal) is just like having a flash. Really, when I'm sick and take a shot, the flash from the 
heroin is nicer than a coke flash. One thing is sure to me; morning brown is the nicest shot you 
can experience on a day." </blockquote>
<p>
Not only are (weekly) benefits spent on cocaine before the day of remittance has ended, even 
the grey market value of methadone, has been affected. This widely dispensed heroin 
substitute is frequently sold below the price. Paco and Numa provided information on the 
price dynamics at the drug market at the Central Railway Station and the inflationary effects 
of cocaine: 
<p>
<blockquote>Paco tells: "Normally you have to pay 2.50 (for one tablet of Rohypnol; a strong, 
short acting and therefore popular benzodiazepine), but when there is no one else around with 
ropies the price can go up to 3.50 or even 5.-. With methadone it's the same, normally it is 1.- 
per cc" Numa adds: "There are a lot of dumb people around here. When you come here on a 
Friday everybody is selling methadone (the weekend doses). There is so much around then that 
some of them can't get rid of it, they can't find buyers. So they're lowering the price, some will 
sell it for 50 cents or even less. They should wait until Sunday, then they can make much more 
out of it. Sunday is always a special day: dealers are not at home or won't open the door, and a 
lot of users don't have enough money left to buy dope. And it's hard to get methadone on a 
Sunday, especially here on the C.S." Paco replies: "you know how they are, they can't wait. 
Especially when they are on coke, they need money, fast and now." </blockquote>
<p>
During the field work users were often followed on their daily rounds. The day the following 
fieldnote was recorded Richard and Chris, two older IDUs were accompanied. They were 
contacted at the Central Station, where they were trying to sell their methadone. Their 
behavior was a strong confirmation of the account of Paco and Numa: 
<p>
<blockquote>Richard tells: "The methadone program allows us 10 days off in one year. Today 
we both took 2 days off, Thursday and Friday. And so we could also take the weekend doses 
with us. I have a daily dose of 20 cc and Chris gets 35 cc. Today we both got for 4 days, which 
makes a total of 220 cc, we are trying to sell now. We are trying for a half an hour now, but we 
still haven't found a soul that's interested in it." Chris says: "I Can't find no one either. Only 
some girl, but she wanted 100 cc for 50,=. I first want to look further." Half an hour later 
Richard finds a customer. He first wants to buy 25 cc for 25.-, but Richard offers him 55 cc for 
35.-. Richard says: "But wait a second, I have to ask my friend, we're together in this you 
know." He walks towards Chris who is still searching for buyers. Chris agrees. Richard 
continues: "We make 35.-. Than we can buy '2 streep wit en 1 streep bruin'(0.2 gram cocaine 
and 0.1 gram heroin). The rest we can pay in methadone at the dealer." Chris replies: "Okay 
with me, but lets go now, this takes so long and I really need a hit now." </blockquote>
<p>
When they sold their methadone, they rushed to a house address, bought the drugs, went 
home and shot a cocktail. The consequence of being without methadone the coming three 
days did not seem to bother them much. 
<p>
Impaired judgment may lead to overestimation of criminal skills and indifference over the 
consequences of ones actions, as long as it generates more cocaine: 
<p>
<blockquote>"I was sentenced for a burglary, they caught me on the spot. It was because of the 
coke. The day before I made a lot of money. First, I bought some clothes for 700.- and gave my 
mother 300.- to have the television repaired. The rest I gave to her to keep it save for me. But 
that day I went on going to her, each time asking for 100.-. I don't know exactly how many 
times I went, but the last time was about two a clock in the morning She got very angry at me 
and told me to take all the money. That night I spent 1100.- on dope, mostly cocaine. When I 
ran out of money I still wanted more and decided to go out to get money. I wasn't sick or so, I 
just wanted more coke. The people at the place I was tried to stop me from going, but I would 
not listen. I just wanted more." </blockquote>
<p>
In this case, the arrest meant the end of the cocaine binge. Although during the fieldwork only 
few cases of violent behavior could be established, several violence stories associated with 
out-of-control cocaine use were recorded. 
<p>
<blockquote>Jerry tells about a guy who went crazy through his excessive cocaine use. "He 
started to demolish the room downstairs and also broke a window. He just wanted more 
cocaine." </blockquote>
<p>
Normally these outburst were directed at other community members:
<p>
<blockquote>Last week Footy tried to rip me off my money. He first tried to borrow 25.- of 
me. I told him I did not have money. Then he started to threat me, he took the sword I keep as 
an ornament and put it on my breast. He wanted me to empty my pockets. I did not do it, we 
went into a struggle and I took the sword from him. I threw this table to him and then he backed 
off." </blockquote>
<p>
Intensive cocaine use can render the user overly sensitive to external stimuli, especially 
sound: 
<p>
<blockquote>The Surinamese user ... stands up and says: "My head. My ears are singing" This 
happens after he's been smoking (cocaine from the glass) for 15 minutes. He says he has to 
leave and goes out on the street. </blockquote>
<p>
This sensitivity can lead to social withdrawal. Some users, particularly IDUs, can not stand 
others around when taking cocaine and therefore isolate themselves. One IDU told that when 
shooting cocaine, he retreats himself into the shed behind his parents house, puts wadding in 
his ears and a towel over his eyes. If not, his rush would be ruined. For an outsider such 
events may not look pleasurable and even for insiders such behavior can be startling, but as 
the comment in the next fieldnote indicates, there is clearly some entertainment value in the 
act:
<p>
<blockquote>"Lately we had somebody here who was only shooting coke, about 1 gram a day. 
When he had taken a shot, he used to lay down and wanted everybody to be quiet. His eyes 
would turn in his head and his arms and legs would swing wildly in the air, shaking his body. 
He looked 'para', but he seemed to enjoy his shot. As soon as the shot was worked out he would 
take another one, over and over." </blockquote>
<p>
In a minority of cases, when users involved in intensive cocaine use are disturbed in their 
rush they may turn aggressive. 
<p>
Paranoid thinking is often associated with heavy cocaine use. The relation between cocaine 
and paranoia has been clinically known ever since cocaine became widely used (3). Paranoia 
and related phenomena like restlessness and anxiety are indeed well known as consequences 
of heavy cocaine use in the Rotterdam heroin scene. Users talk a lot about paranoia and relate 
it to the use of cocaine:
<p>
<blockquote>Mover [has smoked cocaine and heroin. He]... is very speedy, talks fast and loud, 
sweat on his face. Nadir bends over to his neighbor saying: "you see how para he is, it's the 
cocaine". </blockquote>
<p>
Prior to the following fieldnote, Ria had just taken an injection of cocaine:
<p>
<blockquote>Ria comes down to the first floor and starts searching in a plastic bag which is 
filled with garbage. Gus (her boyfriend) tells her to stop with what she's doing but she continues 
searching. She goes on for about 10 minutes and finally comes up with some old stamp bags 
(which had contained drugs). she shouts at Gus; it seems to have something to do with the bags. 
"Stop it Ria", Gus shouts back, "you're talking nonsense, it's just paranoia!" A few minutes later 
upstairs, Ria is having a nervous breakdown, she is crying heavily. "I can't stand it any longer", 
she's crying, "Can't you see I need rest. Tell them all to go, Gus, I want them out." 
</blockquote>
<p>
As they frequently give dealers the opportunity to sell drugs, it is often very crowded in the 
house of Ria and Gus and they hardly have any privacy. Moreover, because of the dealing, 
there is always a risk of police busts, which results in a continuous tension. 
<p>
Another psychological cocaine-related problem, frequently mentioned in the literature, is 
depression (14). Both field and clinical observations have shown that after periods of heavy 
use of cocaine, users may often get depressed (12, 26). Harrie, a 40 year old native Dutch 
drug user who has been shooting up for about 20 years is a case in point. Over the last years 
Harrie has used methadone, heroin and primarily amphetamines. During the fieldwork period, 
Harrie started dealing heroin and cocaine. He left the methadone maintenance program and 
stopped taking speed. Instead he began shooting cocktails of heroin and cocaine. The first 
months this went fine; he earned more than enough to support his habit, even to pay a dealing 
team, and began to live with a woman. But later Harrie started having problems. He was 
robbed twice, which was stressful, and felt forced to hire bodyguards which were expensive. 
The begging and wheedling of customers brought additional stress. About a month prior he 
ran short of money and had to stop dealing. Shortly after that, his girlfriend left. Attempting 
to feel better he continued binging on large amounts of cocaine but grew more and more 
depressed. He talked about suicide and feeling down. The following fieldnote documents the 
cocaine related depression Harrie fell into at the end of his binge:
<p>
<blockquote>Harrie is sitting in the corner in a car seat. His face looks very sad and his eyes are 
wet although he is not crying. He says he called because he doesn't see any perspective 
anymore. He is not able to make any distinction between his problems and can't say what 
exactly bothers him. He says everybody has let him down and he would like to commit suicide, 
but does not dare. When asked what he wants to do about his situation he says he does not 
know, "what difference does it make. It all seems one black hole." He has not eaten for days but 
refuses offers of food, saying a shot of cocaine would make him feel better. He asks and almost 
begs several times for money to get some coke, but does not think that cocaine is a part of his 
problem. He feels left alone and thinks he's so down because his relation broke up. 
</blockquote>
<p>
Clearly Harrie is unable to make sense of his condition or distinguish the ingredients of the 
process that left him in his present state. Deprivation of food (and obviously sleep) have taken 
their toll. But, most of all, his complete fixation on cocaine --in his perception the drug was 
not part of the problem, but the one and only solution-- prevented him from making any 
rational assessment.
<p>
It has also been demonstrated that cocaine has a disturbing effect on sleeping patterns (26). In 
this context, the use of benzodiazepines and other pills has been reevaluated in the heroin 
scene. Before the increase in cocaine use, benzodiazepines and other pills were mainly used 
by a low status minority, nicknamed pill freaks. Nowadays, many users take benzodiazepines 
to control negative side-effects of cocaine, such as disturbed sleeping patterns: 
<p>
<blockquote>"I'm having sleeping problems, that's why I use Rohypnol and Valium, so I can 
sleep." </blockquote>
<p>
Besides sleeplessness, these prescription drugs are used to decrease restlessness produced by 
cocaine. Prior to the next excerpt the user has just injected a cocktail of cocaine and heroin:
<p>
<blockquote>"I've got to walk, I'm 'speedy' and by the way I can get some pills somewhere." 
</blockquote>
<p>
In the Central Station survey 59 % of the sample used benzodiazepines. Apart from cocaine 
related self medication applications, benzodiazepines, e.g. ropies (rohypnols) and other pills 
are taken to substitute, supplement or potentiate the effect of other drugs. The stereotypical 
staggering junkie is often the product of the use of large doses of pills. A considerable 
number of users take pills to ameliorate withdrawal when they cannot get heroin:
<p>
<blockquote>Achmed tells he's sick and asks Nadir if he got something for him. He explains: 
"Friday (today it is saturday) I sold all my weekend methadone to buy heroin. But now I've got 
nothing I took a Rohypnol, it keeps you easy for a couple of hours. But it doesn't take away the 
withdrawal symptoms".</blockquote>
<p>
The combination of benzodiazepines with other drugs, alcohol in particular, gives a high 
some users appreciate, but can also produce unexpected effects and subsequent amnesia. 
Therefore many users feel ambivalent about their use:
<p>
<blockquote>Achmed tells that the effect of the rohypnol is waning off. "It helps a little, but I 
don't like to use it at all, it's bull shit. I always call it 'de vergeetpil' (the forget-pill). I'll tell you 
what it did to my brother. Once he came home and was totally upset, like a mad man. He had 
used rohypnol and alcohol. A fight came up. He fought with my father and me. He made a 
mess. The next morning when he woke up he asked me what had happened. He didn't know 
anything about it, couldn't remember a thing. He was very ashamed. That's why I call it a 
vergeetpil." </blockquote>
<p>
The combination with opiates may lead, depending on the doses, to an unexpected nod or 
even overdose, especially when benzodiazepines are not regularly used:
<p>
<blockquote>Harrie was very upset about the 'rip-off' and took two 'ropies'. Normally he never 
does. From the ropies he got relaxed. But some time later he took a shot and through the 
combination with the pills he went out (into a deep nod). </blockquote>
<p>
Transitions between administration rituals --in a considerable number of cases related to 
cocaine use-- will be addressed in chapter six.

<b>Conclusions</b>
<p>
In contrast with some years ago, when cocaine was incidentally used by a minority of heroin 
users, cocaine now seems to have become the underlying motor of the former heroin scene. 
The results presented in this chapter indicate that rituals, developed for the use of heroin, 
which effects last about four to six hours, are not instantly adaptive for cocaine use, as this 
substance forces users in administration schedules of twenty minutes or less. Because of the 
short lasting effects and the subsequent high frequency administration schedules, the 
perceived availability of the drug is for most users much lower than that of heroin (although 
the drug may be just as easy to purchase), provoking increased drug craving and thus higher 
drug use levels. 
<p>
The cocaine use patterns of the heroin users in this study result in a deep paradox of pleasure 
and pain. While most users are fully aware of cocaine's paradoxical qualities, only few are 
able to withstand the seduction of the intense high cocaine delivers. In that respect, binging 
on cocaine has some points in common with a crusade. Blind for the negative consequences, 
the binger resembles a food and sleep deprived hallucinating crusader, who is mesmerized by 
a vision of (artificial) paradise, that, when rushing on coke, is so intense it almost becomes 
tangible. Intensive use, however, not infrequently entails tremendous sacrifices. It is therefore 
not surprising that users often describe cocaine in lyrical or religious as well as derogatory 
terms (27).
<p>
However, Grapendaal et al. recently wrote that "users can consciously choose to (temporarily) 
quit the use of cocaine" (27).  Although their respondents displayed a fearful respect for 
cocaine and refer to the substance in terms as "insatiable appetite", "bottomless pit", "never 
enough", "forbidden fruit" and "... absolutely no brakes on this stuff", these authors conclude 
that "any compulsion due to the composition of the substance is ... out of the question. One 
uses cocaine as long as certain rewards are connected to its use and use is functional in a 
certain lifestyle. Use ceases as soon as the (figurative) costs outweigh the benefits" (27). 
While some users indeed seem able to stop the use of cocaine at will, such a bold conclusion 
does not seem justified by the data they present. As this chapter makes clear, a considerable 
number of users go to any lengths using cocaine and persist far beyond  the point a rational 
cost benefit analysis allows. Some users renounce cocaine only after having paid a 
considerable price in terms of economical, social, psychological and legal costs. Not 
surprisingly, periods of intense cocaine use often end with arrest and incarceration. 
<p>
For some, such experiences or those of friends are an incentive to (further) abstain from 
cocaine:
<p>
<blockquote>Petra says: "Not for me, I never use coke, I never did and I will never start to do 
so. I have seen enough of that shit".</blockquote>
<p>
However, many users do not succeed to abstain from cocaine use and regularly experience 
some degree of the in this chapter described problems. In order to prevent or minimize these 
problems most users have developed cocaine/heroin patterns that, besides satisfying the 
craving for the high cocaine provides, also aim to control its adverse effects. This is an 
indication of some degree of adaptation. Chapter seven will discuss these patterns and explore 
the determinants that moderate their effectiveness. 
<p>
At this point it can, however, be concluded that in this population control over cocaine is still 
far from perfect. Rituals and rules developed for heroin use can apparently only slowly be 
adapted to cocaine. The, compared to heroin, low perceived availability of cocaine 
complicates this process to a large degree. With the nesting of cocaine in heroin rituals, the 
homeostasis and normalization of the heroin user has been severely disturbed.

Most research participants either chased or injected their drugs. In general, these drug 
administration rituals were rather stable. As explained in the previous chapter, cocaine basing 
may well be increasing among chasers. But in the great majority of observations it was 
accompanied by chasing heroin, while cocaine chasing remained a common mode as well. 
Transitions from chasing to injecting and vice versa were also observed. In the following, 
these cases will be presented. 
<p>
<a name="smok"></a>
<b>Transitions from Smoking to Injecting</b>
<p>
During the fieldwork some research participants seemed in a transition phase from chasing to 
injecting. In this period they seemingly spent more time with IDUs and some tried to hide the 
fact that they injected for (non-injecting) peers. Freek, the subject in the following fieldnote, 
had been chasing for five years. He told that recently he started dealing to finance his habit. 
He was observed in a house where many IDUs live. It is one of the few house addresses 
where injecting is allowed and the house was visited by large numbers of both chasers and 
IDUs. At the time of observation he was not dealing, which may explain his transition to 
injecting in terms of drug availability:
<p>
<blockquote>A little later Freek wanted to shoot up. He asked everybody to soften their 
conversation. "I need a little rest around, otherwise I can't fix up and I don't want all the clients 
to see me shooting up." He said. "I didn't know you are shooting." Ronald asked "I thought you 
only chased your dope?" "I do both." Freek replied. </blockquote>
<p>
Freek asked for some silence so that he could concentrate on injecting. Apparently this was 
not a routine procedure. Lacking skills and experience, injecting was a stressful activity, as 
the rest of the observation shows:
<p>
<blockquote>Freek tied an electric wire around his right arm and searched for a vein. With his 
forefinger he tensely palpated his skin. It took him some time to locate a suitable vein. More 
than once he took up the syringe but hesitated and put it back on the table again. He changed the 
wire to his other arm and repeated the procedure. Then he found a good spot and inserted the 
needle. </blockquote>
<p>
In the next observation neophyte arousal is also evident: 
<p>
<blockquote>Abdul asks Mohammed if he wants to help him setting the shot. Mohammed only 
wants to help him binding off his arm and finding a suitable vein. Abdul tells that this is maybe 
the tenth time he takes a shot, "I'm not so good at it yet". After pricking 5 times he manages to 
get into a vein. They are both pretty excited. Mohammed from the cocktail (he had already 
injected) and Abdul from the attempt to shoot, and they start to quarrel. Mohammed says he 
shoots much longer (about 6 months) and so he knows what he's talking about and knows how 
to do it best. </blockquote>
<p>
The transition from chasing to injecting is made for a variety of obvious and less obvious 
reasons --often in combination. Some chasers only smoke heroin combined with cocaine 
because they dislike the taste of heroin alone:
<p>
<blockquote>"I'm out of cocaine and I don't like to chase the heroin pure. I can't stand the taste, 
it's so dirty." </blockquote>
<p>
This man, a long time user who stopped injecting because he ran out of accessible veins, 
sniffs his heroin when he does not have cocaine available. A strong dislike of the heroin taste 
may be a reason to initiate injecting: 
<p>
<blockquote>"I did chase when I started to use. But now I'm shooting. When chasing I had to 
throw up all the time. Almost every time I did it I got sick. It was quite an experience, shooting 
the first time, getting stoned without throwing up." </blockquote>
<p>
Other users need to hide their drug use, for example for their family. Chasing takes them too 
much time, which makes it harder to cover their use: 
<p>
<blockquote>"Because I don't want my family to know about my heroin use, I can't use in the 
living-room. I always used the attic to chase the dragon. But it took me half an hour or more 
until I had smoked enough and could go down again. That made my family wondering what I 
was doing up there; what took me so long. Therefore I started shooting and now I can do it in 5 
minutes." </blockquote>
<p>
<I>Cocaine</I>
<p>
Several statements of users and a considerable number of observations point at cocaine as a 
significant factor in the transition to injecting. The main reasons for initiating injecting, 
mentioned in this study were the faster and more intense effect. These reasons would apply to 
cocaine as well as heroin, but when explanations were given these generally referred to 
cocaine --Novice IDUs prefer shooting cocaine, above chasing or basing, because of the 
extreme 'flash' (rush). "Waugh, this is much better then smoking. Now you feel the flash right 
away", explained a user moments after he injected a cocktail. And another user explained: 
"Much better than the base-flash, it's the highest high you can get." 
<p>
Frequently chasers start shooting cocaine, while continuing heroin smoking:
<p>
<blockquote>Billy asks Dirk what he wants. "Let's do coke first and then a cocktail", Dirk 
replies. ... Both shoot up without using a belt. Billy in the inner left arm. His arm is covered 
with needle-tracks. Dirk is shooting in his right arm. He has very little marks on his arm. When 
he is finished he takes the role of tinfoil that lies on the table, tears off a piece ( 15 by 7 cm.), 
heats it first, puts some heroin on it and starts chasing. "I'm only shooting now and then", he 
says, "strictly speaking I am a chaser." </blockquote>
<p>
Besides the intensified effects of (cocaine) injecting, the use of other drugs, in particular 
benzodiazepines may also play a role, as these can undermine internalized inhibitions. In the 
following excerpt Doug explains why he initiated injecting:
<p>
<blockquote>"You know me, have you ever see me shooting up, no never. Maybe some years 
ago I've tried it several times, but normally I always smoke dope. Now since 2 weeks or so I 
started shooting cocaine. This cocaine is so good, so after the first time I was sold off to it. It 
happened like this: I took a few, maybe three, Rohypnols. A friend of mine was here too, he 
said: "Hey man, try this (shooting), it's good cocaine". Doug continues: "Normally I wouldn't do 
it and keep refusing. But now, through the Ropies, I crossed the line." </blockquote>
<p>
In Doug's case the cocaine rush reinforces continuation of needle use despite negative 
information and knowledge. Other reasons for switching to injection include the high costs of 
chasing and basing cocaine. Paco, a  30 years old Moroccan user states:
<p>
<blockquote>"I am shooting mostly, sometimes I chase. I learned it from another Moroccan. I 
shoot every day, sometimes one a day, sometimes 10 a day when I have enough money or dope, 
especially cocaine. Cocaine I always shoot. Basing is too expensive and it takes too long. When 
you shoot you feel the flash right away." </blockquote>
<p>
<I>Cultural Barriers to Injecting</I>
<p>
Table 6.1 presents the administration rituals for the different ethnic groups in the study. The 
table indicates that the prevalence of injecting among minority drug users is very low. Other 
Dutch studies found similar distributions (1). During the fieldwork only one Surinamese male 
was observed injecting in a group of white Dutch IDUs. Injecting in Surinamese groups was 
not observed. Injecting drug use is highly disapproved of in the Surinamese community. 
Therefore, Surinamese users will normally conceal their injecting drug use, which may result 
in an underestimation of actual injecting prevalence. 
<p>
Table 6.1
<p>
Although such disapproval may be less strong among Moroccan users, injecting Moroccans 
will normally also hide their  injection drug use for non injecting peers. Prior to the 
observation of the two novice Moroccan IDUs (Abdul and Mohammed) presented above, 
these young men picked up 2 new syringes in the shelter next to the Central Station, but first 
one of them went in to look if there were no acquaintances or other Moroccans in the shelter. 
He explained: "I don't want them to know I'm shooting, but we were lucky as there was no 
one in." 
<p>
The reasons for not injecting among minority users may often seem rather idiosyncratic. Such 
as Shaffy's --a 22 years old Moroccan:
<p>
<blockquote>"Although I was always with friends who were shooting, I never started. I tell you 
why. Three years ago I had to do some blood tests at the CAD (methadone program). I went 
into the doctors room, but had to wait because the woman was still busy taking blood from 
another. So I could watch her doing it. And man, she really made a mess from it. As if she did it 
for the first time. She was really stirring the needle in his arm to find a vein. The man was hurt 
by her for minutes. I first wanted to leave, but it was my turn already. She messed me up as well 
and it really hurt me. This cured me from the lust to shoot for ever. And then, shooting up is bad 
for the veins." </blockquote>
<p>
Such accounts may, however, well be expressions of specific socio-cultural inhibitions. 
Nadir, one of the Moroccan key respondents explained the low prevalence of injecting drug 
use among his compatriots in terms of religious blood taboos:* 
<p>
<blockquote>The majority of the Moroccans are not acquainted with the shooting ritual and its 
paraphernalia. If they have ever seen a syringe, it was at a doctor's practice. Many of the 
Moroccan users come from Berber or other rural areas, where experience with doctors is rare. 
The doctor and his symbolic instrument --the syringe-- are fearfully respected. </blockquote>
<p>
This may well be a folk religion interpretation of the islamic (and Jewish) taboo on the 
consumption of blood --exemplified in the practice of ritual slaughter in which animals are 
bled dry before further processing (2). In the described Berber version of 'popular Islam' the 
scope of this basic rule of conduct seems thus extended to medical syringe use, perhaps 
encouraged by rivaling traditional healers. Imported by Berber immigrants and adapted to the 
situational requirements of the drug scene this taboo may well function as a cultural threshold 
for injecting, as was explicitly suggested by Nadir:
<p>
<blockquote>"According to this 'blood myth', evil spirits are attracted to blood and the devil has 
power over the blood. In Morocco this belief is so deeply rooted, that some people fear and 
might even try to escape from a doctor or hospital injection. In The Netherlands these 
Moroccans hear that injecting drugs produces all kind of diseases. To them, this is proof that the 
devil has been involved through the blood." </blockquote>
<p>
Van Gelder and Sijtsma also pointed at the religious meaning of blood as a reason for the 
Moroccan aversion of injecting (3). Mindful of Nadir's account, the following conversation 
between two Moroccan users was witnessed later during the fieldwork: 
<p>
<blockquote>"Why don't you start shooting?". The boy replies, his face looking ugly: "Shoot-
ing? That's filthy, very filthy. I will have nothing to do with it. You know on some addresses 
you find for instance an ashtray full with blood. Bah, it makes me feel sick, even when I talk 
about it now. I don't want to have anything to do with blood, I stay away from it as much as I 
can. You get diseases from it, you heard what's happening with AIDS. I will never start 
shooting, it's dangerous." </blockquote>
<p>
Surinamese users are also believed to maintain a taboo on injecting which, supposedly, is 
rooted in 'Winti' --a popular Creole folk religion (4). This study established some support for 
this assumption. At one of the frequently visited places where a group of older white Dutch 
IDUs lived, one day Sheep, a 35 - 40 years old Creole Surinamese man had moved in. 
Although all other residents and many of the visitors were IDUs, and while almost at any 
moment there was somebody injecting, Sheep restricted himself to smoking. A few times he 
was observed making disapproving remarks to people injecting. "I'm proud of my body.", he 
explained his aversion for injecting. Although the other Surinamese ethnic groups 
(Hindustani, Chinese, Javanese) may not share the Winti religion, the taboo on injecting is 
often shared. 
<p>
In spite of such assumed protective cultural factors an increasing number of Moroccans and 
Surinamese do start injecting, which, according to users themselves, seems mainly associated 
with cocaine use. A trend already signalled by van Gelder and Sijtsma (4). During a visit to a 
dealing address the following discussion was observed after Lottie, a Surinamese female 
dealer had just served two white Dutch IDUs:
<p>
<blockquote>When the IDUs are gone Lottie says: "Shooters, always in a hurry." ... The other 
Surinam woman says: "it's a matter of how you take care of your body, I simply want no spike 
in my body, I hate it. You know, people start to shoot when they feel they don't get enough out 
of chasing anymore. But "we Surinam people" don't like spikes in our bodies." Lottie says: 
"That isn't the case anymore. More and more Surinam users start to shoot, they go for the coke 
flash. This happens more and more. I don't want to have anything to do with shooters or 'pill 
freaks'." </blockquote>
<p>
For a considerable number of Moroccan users, some additional factors may further reinforce 
the initiation of injecting. These users have problems complying with Islam standards or 
family and community obligations and are for that reason thrown out of the house and 
ostracized by the community. Often homeless they gather around the central station and in 
shelters for homeless men. There they have more contact with native Dutch users and 
especially with older IDUs. Diffusion of the injection ritual may have started with these 
contacts. In addition to contacts with Dutch IDUs, diffusion of injection has occurred through 
contacts with groups of Moroccan users who travel from countries where heroin injection is 
the dominant administration ritual, such as France and Belgium.

<b>Transitions from Injecting to Smoking</b>
<p>
Transitions can also be observed in the other direction. For example, some users stopped 
injecting because they tried to regain control over their drug use and their life in general. 
Another user ceased injecting in prison. After he was released he started using heroin again, 
but this time he smoked. Social pressure seems an important factor. One IDU, started 
working as doorman with a group of smoking users, who did not want him to inject: 
<p>
<blockquote>"I stopped shooting up two days ago", he tells, "cause it is better for me. It's not 
easy but they're helping me very good. I quit kinda radically ..." </blockquote>
<p>
Three weeks later he was out of work again:
<p>
<blockquote>"I'm shooting up again", he says, "I'm also chasing, but now that I don't work 
anymore, I use less dope and that's why I shoot it."</blockquote>
<p>
It seems that both economic considerations and group rules (peer group pressure) influence 
the mode of administration.
<p>
Harrie, the older IDU mentioned before, also tried to stop injecting. He had multiple reasons. 
Observing him, it became clear that he had a hard time finding a vein. Often he was bleeding 
from all limbs when he finally got off. After more than 20 years of injecting there were few 
accessible veins left. Furthermore, his new girlfriend was opposed to his injecting. Last but 
not least, injecting cocaine became hard to control. This seemed a major reason for Harrie:
<p>
<blockquote>"For a couple of days I started to smoke cocaine (from aluminum foil). I find it 
more cozier, more relaxed. And I feel I'm more in control too, when I'm shooting I keep on 
going on. One after the other." </blockquote>
<p>
Although he really tried, Harrie was not able to stop injecting permanently. For about a 
month he actually injected much less and during this period his veins got some rest and 
became more accessible again when he tried to inject. 
<p>
Difficulties with injecting is a common problem among longtime IDUs. Due to a history of 
poor and unhygienic injection technique, most veins have collapsed, are covered with scar 
tissue and have become inaccessible:
<p>
<blockquote>He ties off his right arm above the elbow. He tries four spots before he hits a vein. 
The first spot is on his inside of the underarm, somewhere in the middle between hand and 
elbow. He moves the spike around under the skin, digging for a vein. Blood drips on the carpet. 
A second attempt is made somewhat closer to the elbow and a third on elbow height. Both fail. 
The fourth attempt --just above the elbow-- is successful. "Well finally, I am having more and 
more troubles with my veins." He pushes only half of the contents in the vein and boots three 
times, while the solution in the barrel gets bloodier. Then he empties the barrel. When he boots 
again, he looses the vein. He digs around, manages to get the needle back in and boots again. 
Again he looses the vein and tries to get it back in, but in vain. Finally he stops and takes the 
needle out of his arm. He has been busy for four minutes. </blockquote>
<p>
Some IDUs were observed digging in their arms and legs for periods up to two hours. Often 
they try one site after the other without loosening the tourniquet, so that they bleed from 
many wounds. Despite the pain, stress and 'blown shots', most of these older IDUs postpone 
stopping until all their veins are gone. Prior to this moment they often initiate chasing as a 
secondary route --when injecting fails, or to temper arousal and improve concentration in 
advance of an attempt to inject. But sooner or later they are confronted with the inevitable 
choice, as becomes clear from Patrick's account. After injecting for 20 years, Patrick reached 
his limit and finally stopped injecting:
<p>
<blockquote>"I stopped shooting up simply cause I could not get a 'hit' anymore. I have been 
shooting up for 20 years now. In the end I wasted three shots on one 'hit'; the solution 
coagulated or the needle clogged and I got sick of the mess, ... all the blood and the pain. I shot 
in my fingers, I tried all places. At last it hurt so much I got tears in my eyes. I added coke to the 
heroin, not for the kick but to relieve the pain." </blockquote>
<p>
Just as for Harrie, terminating injecting was not easy for Patrick:
<p>
<blockquote>"When I stopped shooting up and started chasing I had to use more to meet the 
gap in effect. In the beginning it was hard, I missed that certain feeling, you know." 
</blockquote>
<p>
What Patrick missed is made clear by Harrie, when he explained why he relapsed into 
injecting again:
<p>
<blockquote>"I can't control it, I just keep on going. (...) When I was chasing I was waiting for 
the flash to come, or something. I kept on smoking and thought: where is it, when does it strike 
me. I missed the flash. I've always been a heavy user. When I took drugs, I took a lot so I would 
really feel it. That's what I'm missing when chasing." </blockquote>

<a name="con"></a>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
In general, the observed rituals are fairly stable --most users tend to stick to their ritual of 
preference. Other Dutch studies found similar results (1, 5). Although economic incentives 
(drug availability) play a major role, the choice for a ritual is also determined by several other 
social and personal factors, which are subject to change. Such choices are for example 
influenced by personal health and group norms. For long time injectors the condition of their 
veins becomes increasingly the main determinant of the choice whether to inject or not. At 
some moment they have literally used up their veins and injecting stops being an option. The 
decision to terminate injecting is postponed as long as possible, only making the problem 
worse. Prior to this moment the injecting frequency decreases and is supplemented by 
chasing. When moving from a network with a dominant smoking norm into an injection 
oriented network, injecting becomes a serious option. Not only because of social pressure, but 
also because it may yield certain economic benefits, e.g. when sharing drugs. Sharing drugs is 
a common activity both among smokers and IDUs (see chapter nine), but they engage in 
different sharing rituals (dividing powder v.s. solution). Conversely, when an injector 
associates with a group of smokers, for example when accepting a job in a dealing collective, 
injecting may be terminated to avoid social disapproval or simply because it is proscribed. 
Nonetheless, again these social pressures cannot be detached from the economics. Besides the 
drug sharing aspect, the increased access to drugs will assuage terminating injecting.

<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
Chapter four described the two ritual patterns of heroin use that are most prevalent in The 
Netherlands. The overwhelming majority in the study did not limit their drug use to heroin 
only, and also consumed cocaine and, to a lesser extent, other psychoactive substances. They 
are polydrug users. The nesting of cocaine in heroin rituals has had a profound influence on 
the total drug use pattern of the research subjects. Chapter five discussed the effects of this 
high prevalence of cocaine use on the use patterns and the consequences for the individual 
users and their social environment. Chapter six presented the findings on transitions between 
the two common administration rituals. In these chapters the discussion was largely limited to 
"the observable sequences of psychomotor acts" --the first of the two requirements of the 
definition of ritual utilized in this study. It was demonstrated that both the use patterns of 
IDUs and chasers, whether they use heroin only or in whatever combination with cocaine, 
fulfill the definitional requirement of a prescribed sequence. The extensive descriptions 
established that for both rituals a well defined set of paraphernalia is dictated --all with their 
specific function. 
<p>
Whereas before the discussion was largely confined to the descriptive level, the coming 
chapters will take a more analytical approach and concentrate on the instrumental functions, 
and symbolic meaning of drug use rituals (the special meaning part of the definition). Chapter 
seven discusses the instrumental function, while chapter eight will focus on the symbolic 
meaning at an individual level. Chapter nine addresses the significance of these rituals for the 
relationships between drug using individuals in their social networks. 
<p>

<a name="ment"></a>
<b>Instrumental Functions of Drug Use Rituals</b>
<p>
Rituals fulfill various functions depending on the circumstances. Some of those functions are 
more and others less obvious. The fulfillment of practical needs related to the day-to-day 
management of drug use is an important aspect of both solitary and social rituals. In 
particular, in solitary drug use rituals this function is stressed. These rituals can be observed 
to function as regulatory device which aims at:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Maximizing the desired drug effect.
<li>Controlling drug use levels and balancing the positive and negative effects of the used 
drugs.
<li>Preventing secondary problems.
</ol>
In practice, these functions are highly intertwined and for the superficial observer they may 
be hard to separate. For the purpose of analysis, however, they will be dealt with as separate 
as possible.
<p>
<I>Maximizing the Desired Drug Effect.</I>
<p>
Maximizing the desired drug effect can be seen in the preparation, the actual administration 
phase of the ritual and shortly after the drug has been administered. The first two excerpts 
from fieldnotes are examples of such preparatory ritual actions:
<p>
<blockquote>He puts a couple of drops of lemon juice into the cup, enough to cover the heroin 
that is already in there. He then adds a few drops of water from the plastic bottle. "I first boil it 
with 'much' lemon and little water, it dissolves better this way". He puts his lighter under the 
scale ... and boils the content. He doesn't cook it through, but boils it shortly several times. Then 
he adds more water to it and boils it all. He shows what is happening inside the cup. "You see, it 
dissolves beautifully, almost no dirt stays behind".
<p>
With a knife Henry took out  1 stripe of cocaine and put it in a teaspoon. He then poured a 
little ammonia in the spoon and then he added a little salt (baking soda). "Adding a little salt to 
the ammonia gives the best results, I think." </blockquote>
<p>
In both cases the users try to maximize the output of consumable product by ritual procedure. 
In the first case boiling the base heroin with a strong acidic solution is an effective measure, 
but cooking it for a few short times instead of one longer but equivalent interval is not. What 
matters is the (low) pH value related to the total cooking time. Correspondingly, adding 
bicarbonate to the ammonia to improve the conversion from cocaine hydrochloride to cocaine 
base is not a valid procedure as the pH of the ammonia is considerably higher than that of the 
bicarbonate. Thus, in both cases the behavior does not fit a means to an end scheme --it is 
unnecessary by empirical standards (1). In the first example the behavior is mingled with an 
act that does have a causal relationship with the end result. In the following three examples 
the relationship between means and end is more ambiguous:
<p>
<blockquote>Fred took the lumps and started smoking the base in a glass 'water bong'. This 
bong is designed to smoke cannabis. It had a picture of a cannabis plant on it. Fred did not put 
any water in it. "We used to put water in it." Henry said, "But we found out that without water it 
goes much better." </blockquote>
<p>
Whether water is used in base pipes or not is dependent on factors such as group norms and 
personal preferences. It may, however, be of some influence as the contents of the chamber of 
the pipe can hold more smoke than when it is filled with water. 
<p>
<blockquote>After smoking Fred sat back, closed his eyes and laid his head against the back of 
the sofa. He pressed his fingers to his ears and stayed that way for about two minutes. He 
concentrated on the rush. ... 
<p>
Eric took his shot and is concentrated on the flash, sitting on his chair with his head bowed. 
Meanwhile Leo enters the attic. [and starts talking to Eric.] ... Eric asks Leo not to talk to loud 
because he just took a cocktail. </blockquote>
<p>
Both Fred's posture and the position Eric is sitting in, are supposed to have a facilitating 
effect on their rush. Many users have developed their own specific sequence surrounding the 
administration of the drug, intended to boost the rush. Fred puts his fingers in his ears and 
Eric asks Leo to stop talking because they want to exclude outside stimuli which may distract 
their attention from their rush. 
<p>
Chapter four presented some observations of booting (drawing blood back into the syringe 
and reinjecting one or more times). There exists some ambiguity in the scientific literature on 
the function of booting. According to Agar, IDUs boot for two reasons --to test the drug 
quality and to intensify the rush (2). Conversely, Zinberg argues that there is no causal 
relationship between booting and the rush (3). While assisting Doug with injecting, Jack, one 
of our key respondents, gave a more pragmatic explanation: 
<p>
<blockquote>He takes the syringe, inserts the needle in the skin and hits a vein rather quickly. 
He pulls up some blood, presses the plunger, pulls up, presses, and pulls up again  2 cc. of 
blood. Then he takes out the needle because he lost the vein. He hits again and presses the 
blood-drug mixture in Doug's vein. "It's a waste to throw it away. There is still some dope in it." 
Jack says. </blockquote>
<p>
Jack, as most Rotterdam users, used a two-piece 2 ml syringe. When the plunger of such an 
syringe is pushed down completely, there still is some (0.05 - 0.1ml) solution left in the hub 
(4). This may go up to (an estimated) 5% of the injected dose and therefore have some effect 
on the intensity of the rush. A similar effect may work when using an eye dropper with an 
attached needle, the most prevalent injecting device in the time of Agar's research in the 
U.S.A. (1960s). In the 1970s, when Zinberg did his research, the 1 ml insulin syringes were 
more commonly used and these are constructed in a way that there is hardly a residue left in 
the barrel when the plunger is pushed down completely. This may explain Zinberg's 
conclusion. Even when this explanation is valid, it does not account for booting five or more 
times, which was repeatedly observed. 
<p>
These activities are directed at the perfection of the performance (5) with the goal of 
increasing the desired effect of the drug. Perfection is reached through repetition. The 
pleasure inducing or rewarding effects of drugs are a main incentive for their use as can be 
witnessed in the following quotes: "I want to enjoy the coke flash"; "It's pleasing me the most 
when I smoke them together"; "White really is a delicacy"; "Ah, How nice it is!"; "I found the 
cocaine high delicious". Getting as much effect as possible from a given dose is the incentive 
for these actions. 
<p>
<I>Controlling Use Levels and Balancing Positive and Negative Effects of Drugs.</I>
<p>
Most experienced users are well aware of the shadow sides complementing the desired effects 
of drug use --prolonged high intake of heroin leads to unmanageable dependence levels and 
frequent use of large amounts of cocaine results in negative side effects that outweigh the 
desired effects. An important function of drug taking rituals is to control use levels and 
manage or balance the negative and positive effects of the ingested substances. It is important 
to remark that control does not necessarily have to entail lower levels of intake. Within the 
study population, stability of use levels and successful prevention and management of, drug 
use (cocaine) related (psychological) problems may be more appropriate indicators of control. 
Control may best be perceived as a multidimensional process. Jack who is often employed as 
doorman at house addresses explained how he, in order to stay in control, organizes his use:
<p>
<blockquote>"I make 'kleine shotjes' (small fixes) with 1/4 to 1/2 'streep' (=0.025 to 0.050 
gram) heroin in it, always. I will keep doing that. I mean, I can take more but than you get more 
sick too, and you can't effort it any more. Sometimes, when I do have more dope, I don't take 
bigger quantities in one shot, but I'll take more little fixes." </blockquote>
<p>
Jack has a rather stable use pattern. This is related to his rather continuous involvement in 
dealing, securing a steady availability of both cocaine and heroin. He further explained, that 
when working as a doorman his cocaine use goes up. Other users have more fluctuating use 
patterns --a period of heavy, uncontrolled use, followed by a period of regaining control in 
which they lower their intake or (temporarily) abstain from further use of, usually, cocaine: 
<p>
<blockquote>Cor looks good. He wears a nice and clean shirt and a clean jeans. He tells he is 
working as a house painter again after a jobless period. At the moment he is with sick leave. He 
says he is doing alright now. However about two months ago he was not. He was in a period of 
intensive cocaine use. But he realized that he had to cut back his cocaine use to an acceptable 
amount and although he says this has cost much energy, he stopped taking cocaine to recover 
again. He tells that he is using cocaine moderately now. </blockquote>
<p>
The use of ritual procedure to regulate the level of drug use and to balance the positive and 
negative drug effects is common practice among the research participants. This is most 
evident in their day-to-day patterns of heroin and cocaine use. The overwhelming majority 
(96%) used cocaine and knowledge of, and experience with the negative side effects of this 
drug was widespread. Some users say they only use cocaine when there is enough to satisfy 
their craving:
<p>
<blockquote>He tells he's only smoking cocaine when he has enough money to buy a gram or 
more: "Otherwise it's to less and I flip. When I've used a gram or more I've had enough and 
won't buy no more." </blockquote>
<p>
Others periodically decrease their intake of heroin or stop using the drug altogether. This may 
be out of neglect, for example when binging on cocaine (see chapter 5.4.3) or intention --to 
decrease opiate tolerance or in an effort to stop using drugs. In the latter case, cocaine is 
sometimes used to ameliorate or cover heroin withdrawal:
<p>
<blockquote>"A few months ago I kicked heroin with cocaine. In that time I smoked  0.5 g 
cocaine per day and it didn't work me up at all. I felt high. When I smoke coke I want to be 
alone. When it's easy and quiet I don't get worked up from it." </blockquote>
<p>
However, cocaine used in administration rituals, doses and time schedules typical for this 
population (frequent smoking or injecting of relatively high doses) inevitably leads to a 
decrease of the desired effects and an increase of undesired ones. In order to control these 
undesired effects users frequently resort to the use of prescription drugs and heroin. 
According to many users, in particular heroin plays a crucial role in the process of leveling 
off the negative side effects of cocaine:
<p>
<blockquote>Some time later several inhabitants meet in the attic in Arie's room to drink tea. 
They talk about dope, making money, being stoned, pills, etc. ... [and] experiences are being 
exchanged about cocaine-use. Most of them tell they control cocaine through heroin. 
</blockquote>
<p>
Such statements are confirmed by many observations and informal interviews. Adding a knife 
tip of heroin (het kleurtje) to the colorless cocaine when smoked on aluminum foil is only 
partially done to make it easier to smoke or for hedonistic reasons. IDUs' cocktailing or 
injecting heroin shortly after a shot of cocaine is likewise not merely a matter of individual 
preference for a specific high. Countering undesired effects (dysphoria) is a prominent feature 
of these practices. Many users have an intense paradoxical relationship with cocaine, 
resulting in use patterns that spawn and boost the desired pleasurable effects while 
simultaneously self-medicating the negative side effects of the cocaine. They turn-take or 
combine cocaine and heroin, depending on personal preference, mood and drug availability. 
In the next excerpt Nadir explained his preference for turn-taking the two drugs:
<p>
<blockquote>Nadir isn't sure yet what he wants to buy. He says he only wants to buy some 
heroin "because cocaine makes me feel so para (paranoid)". But then suddenly he decides: 
"Well okay, I buy a little bit of cocaine too, just one streep", and he buys 1 stripe heroin  and 1 
stripe cocaine. ... I always first smoke the cocaine, pure without heroin. When I have finished 
the cocaine I start to smoke heroin. I must do it like that, otherwise the cocaine turns me crazy". 
</blockquote>
<p>
It becomes clear that such chemical mood control requires careful titration of the two 
substances. In the following, Jack explains the two main ways to manage the opposite effects 
of cocaine:
<p>
<blockquote>"Feeling the coke flash or not has to do with your spiritual attitude. When you 
don't want to feel it, you won't feel it. Users that don't feel relaxed won't get stoned nice." 
"When I take a shot of heroin after I took cocaine the speediness is taken away. You can talk 
relaxed again, you have the time to listen to other people. Then I feel myself becoming relaxed. 
In use there's a lot of suggestion."  "A cocktail is a shot with 2 drugs, with different effects. I'll 
take a cocktail when I don't want to have such a strong coke flash. I always save some heroin to 
take after the cocktail. The flash from a cocktail is not as intense as from coke only. But, 
everybody has different experiences." </blockquote>
<p>
Jack's explanation underlines the importance of the interaction of pharmacological, 
psychological and social variables in controlling the drug effects. Drug use rituals aim to 
regulate these variables by standardizing the procedures utilized in the drug taking 
experience.
<p>
Cocaine use has been nested in rituals developed for heroin use and has taken over its 
function of primary source of pleasure. This development has altered the function of heroin 
use to a great extend. When both drugs are used, heroin use has become almost completely 
intertwined with and subservient to cocaine use. It is mainly used to modulate the effects of 
cocaine, in particular to ameliorate cocaine's disturbing side effects. Thus, a functional 
relationship between heroin and cocaine has been established, which is displayed in the 
integration of both drugs in shared administration rituals, the aim of which is to maintain a 
delicate balance of desired and undesired drug effects.
<p>
Support for the hypothesis that heroin is used to control the side effects of cocaine is offered 
by the Rotterdam (methadone maintenance) treatment intake data, which is recorded in 
RODIS. Only 32% of the heroin users, applying for methadone did not use cocaine at intake, 
while 62% did and for an additional 6% use of cocaine had become problematic (N=1095). 
Their level of heroin use is presented in the following table. 
<p>
Table 7.1.
<p>
Conform the ethnographic results, the level of heroin use of cocaine users (especially the 
problematic users) was significantly higher than that of non-users (6). A recently published 
study by Grapendaal et al. reported similar results. "The most common combination is heroin 
and cocaine. ... [There exists] a very strong correlation between heroin and cocaine use. When 
both substances are used there exists a preference for similar quantities". Their results 
confirm the changed functions of both heroin and cocaine. Just as in this study, their 
respondents explicitly refer to the paradoxical effects of cocaine and the self-medication 
aspects of heroin in regards to the experienced cocaine related problems: "The coke is the 
nicest of all, but I don't want to become paranoia and therefore I always take some bruin with 
it" (7). 
<p>
In chapter 5.5 it was suggested that prescription drugs have an additional value in controlling 
cocaine's side effects, in particular disturbed sleeping patterns and restlessness. Both the 
Grapendaal et al. study and RODIS corroborate the relevance of this suggestion. Cocaine and 
prescription drugs are combined in many polydrug use patterns (7). Users and problematic 
users of cocaine use significantly more substances than non users (6).
<p>
It can be argued that these ritual cocaine/heroin patterns are odd and rather inefficient 
regulatory devices. However, given the opportunities open to this group of regular users of 
cocaine and heroin, the prevention and management, or self-medication of cocaine related 
problems by use of heroin, does not seem an irrational option. 
<p>
<I>Additional Control Strategies</I>
<p>
Many users do not have (permanent) access to financial resources required for maintaining 
the described cocaine/heroin pattern. They must resort to self regulation strategies that 
revolve around averting drug use situations and (periodical) abstinence. Then, regaining 
control is often the result of changes in the daily patterns and tightening up personal rituals 
and rules regarding drug use. About two months prior to the following fieldnote, Paco was in 
a period of heavy use. His landlord threw him out of his room, because he allowed many 
other users to get high at his place. The landlord had told him that they "did not live like 
normal people do." Being homeless, he spent the nights with friends he knew from the 
Central Station, who offered him a place to sleep --now here, then there. As he did not have 
his own place, he carried his works (injection paraphernalia) around and injected in public 
places, when drugs were available. When he told this, he was very stoned from heroin and 
prescription drugs. Two months later at the station he looked much better and talked about 
going to Morocco to withdraw and recover. He felt he had to as "I'm not living right this way, 
I've got to change." In fact, Paco had just made important changes that brought him back in 
control of his drug use:
<p>
<blockquote>Paco tells he has found a new room to rent last week. "I don't let other people use 
in my house anymore. They just make a lot of mess and troubles for me with the house keeper. 
Now, when I want to use, I get some dope and go home. There I make and take my shot. I'm not 
gonna walk around with lemon, spoon, spike, etc. I don't like to do that." </blockquote>
<p>
Compared to two months earlier he made considerable changes. He found a new room, but 
did not let other users get high there, which must have limited his drug intake substantially as 
in such situations drugs are often shared. He no longer used just because the occasion 
occurred, but tried to plan his use. Moreover, he stopped carrying his works around, averting 
him from using at other places than at home. (This may, however, bring him in a position in 
which he feels forced to share needles when he does need to use outside the house, e.g. when 
being in withdrawal.) Thus, by making significant changes in his ritual and adopting stricter 
rules --only injecting at home; not allowing other people to use at his place; plan his use; not 
carrying works-- which had a stabilizing effect on his life structure, (8) Paco regained control. 
<p>
For other users, taking physical distance from the drugs (scene) seemed an important aspect 
of self regulation:
<p>
<blockquote>"We live in Zeeland. Originally we come from Rotterdam but we moved there 
because of the dope. It's very hard to get any there. But about once a week we make a trip to 
Rotterdam and buy some dope. We don't use every day. I get my methadone from the regional 
CAD. I can pick it up twice a week. They are rather flexible. I'm addicted for more than 15 
years now, I tried to kick the habit many times and I've been clean for some periods. In one of 
these periods he came." He is pointing at the boy. It is a nice looking kid. He is well taken care 
off and looks good. He sits at his fathers feet hanging onto his legs. Softly he asks his parents 
when they will be leaving. "It is a good thing for us", his father says, "living in Zeeland. We 
don't use much, it's hard to get, that is good for us. I have a steady job there too." His wife tells 
she is using for 2.5 to 3 years now but she is not getting any methadone. "As he told we go 
about once a week to Rotterdam and that day we e.g. also go to the zoo, it's a day's outing that 
way." </blockquote>
<p>
By taking physical distance from the ritual place --the drug scene-- thus limiting the number 
of contacts that may lead to the start of the ritual sequence of drug ingestion, this couple 
regulates their access to the drugs. But they still like to use drugs and once a week they do. 
But by making this into a new ritual that combines drug use with other non-drug social 
activities, such as the visit to the zoo, they limit the time spent on using drugs, preventing an 
uncontrolled intake. From the fieldnote we can also see that the availability of methadone can 
be of help in keeping drug use under control. However, not all users fancy methadone. 
Especially Surinamese users often dislike this substitution drug. They emphasize its social 
control function, while it would furthermore lead to a double dependency. Sheep, a 35-40 
years old Creole Surinamese man, who reported using heroin since 1972 explains his dislike 
of the substance:
<p>
<blockquote>"I use heroin and cocaine, I chase." Sheep feels that he is in reasonable control of 
his use. "Sometimes they (fellow users) ask me: You are never sick, how do you do that?" 
"Well, I am not in a methadone program. I don't want methadone, that is worse than heroin. 
You get much sicker from it." </blockquote>
<p>
Participating in a methadone program can also hamper plans of taking distance and regaining 
control: 
<p>
<blockquote>"I was out of control, too much coke, you know. I first stopped the coke use. I was 
still in the methadone program. I had gone down with my dose. I took only three cc methadone 
per day, but I still had to come to the program every day. I didn't like that anymore. I was also 
reducing my heroin use, and coming to Rotterdam each day would make it only harder for me. 
Well, you know how it is, seeing everybody at the program each day. So, I'm not in a program 
anymore. I'm doing okay now, I'm back in control." </blockquote>
<p>
The daily methadone drinking routine can be considered a ritual --the sequence is highly 
determined and to the user it surely has special meaning (for one thing preventing 
withdrawal). The daily visit to the methadone program is often the moment of meeting user-
friends, usually followed by procuring and using drugs. In this way the methadone ritual 
smoothly shifts into the ritual that leads to drug use. The quote "Well, you know how it is, 
seeing everybody at the program each day." has a strong symbolic contents as it refers to drug 
user knowledge "which cannot be shared or transmitted in the course of ordinary social 
interaction" (9). It not only refers to going to the program, but also to the fact that the people 
coming to the program, are participants in the same rituals of taking methadone and drugs. 
Visiting the methadone program is the daily start of a number of ritual sequences --meeting 
user friends, talking about ritual subjects such as wit and bruin, making plans to raise money 
and going out together to do so, going to a dealing address to procure and use drugs and to 
socialize. In this respect, it can also be ascertained that rituals can disturb self regulation. 
While the daily visit to the methadone program offers some degree of life structure, (8) it 
remains a question if this is always a positive contribution, as this activity promotes contacts 
with other daily users. Just as the house address, the methadone program carries several 
characteristics of a ritual place. 
<p>
<I>Preventing secondary problems</I>
<p>
Several distinguishable parts of the drug administration ritual are directed at preventing or 
limiting the impact of so called secondary problems. Chapter four already presented a few 
examples of such practices. Chasers often save their aluminum covered pipe for the following 
morning. When they then wake up and do not have money nor drugs smoking the residue in 
the pipe will take the first withdrawal symptoms away. Some IDUs use ascorbic powder for 
dissolving base heroin instead of lemon juice. It is believed to be safer than using lemon 
juice. The use of a filter when drawing the injectable solution into the syringe is meant to stop 
insoluble impurities and other particles from entering the body, preventing infections. The 
practice of heating the strip of aluminum foil before the drug is put on it and smoked is 
another clear example. It is meant to prevent the inhalation of a coating, which supposedly 
causes respiratory or other health problems. Chapter five described two practices of cocaine 
smokers that are also directed at preventing or limiting damage to the respiratory system --
rinsing the cocaine base lump with water after preparing it with ammonia and using sodium 
bicarbonate instead of ammonia. Besides the supposed preventative effect on the respiratory 
system, some users also believe that this act averts "a terrible headache". What in fact is the 
effect of these precautions is not always clear. It has however become clear that many users 
practice spontaneous protective measures. 
<p>
<a href="#func">Top</a>
<p>
<a name="norm"></a>
<b>Rituals Communicate Cultural Norms</b>
<p>
Many of the above described rituals have over the course of time developed into cultural 
norms --users may point at them and correct one another when they are not followed. For 
example, the practice of saving filters is generally disapproved of, as many users know, some 
by personal experience (in particular older users), that cooking up the filters and injecting this 
solution may cause a severe bodily reaction accompanied by sudden high fevers, chills, body 
shakes, etc., known as the shakes (in the Netherlands) or cotton fever (in the U.S.A.). One 
time a user was observed scolding a fellow user with cotton fever. 
<p>
It was likewise observed that the knowledge of many of these practices is passed on to other 
users, normally in the course of the ritual performance itself. Rituals play an important role in 
educating novices about the rules of drug use (5). They serve to buttress, reinforce and 
symbolize these rules. Generally such information flow takes place at an unconscious level, 
as part of a peer group based social learning process (10). However, it is not uncommon to 
see more experienced users explicitly explain to novices why and how certain things ought to 
be done, as can be witnessed in the following two excerpts from fieldnotes:
<p>
<blockquote>The blonde (smoking) cocaine user is very interested in the shooting and watches 
it carefully. He asks some questions about how it is done and why. Doug answers his questions 
patiently ...
<p>
One of the [men] was explained a part of the cocaine chasing ritual. One of his friends put a 
lump of base on the foil and then with a lighter ... he melted the lump from above and let just a 
little smoke come from it. "This is what you do to take the ammonia rests out of it." "It's better 
for your lungs and you taste the difference." One of his other friends said. </blockquote>
<p>
Myths are an important ingredient of the observed rituals. For example, some users think that 
ascorbic powder is bad for the health, as it would "deposit on the heart valves". In particular 
cocaine seems surrounded by myth. Some users believe that cocaine melts at body 
temperature. Therefore holding a pack of cocaine in the hand or close to the body for some 
time is thought to affect the quality of the drug. But the melting point of cocaine is 
significantly higher than body temperature. For the same reason many IDUs, when preparing 
a cocktail, let the heroin solution cool down before adding the cocaine. Likewise, an injection 
of cocaine is never boiled. Cocaine may dissolve in water at room temperature, but heating 
the solution would probably prevent a lot of abscesses, associated with cocaine injecting, due 
to unsterile conditions. A probable explanation for these cocaine myths could be that cocaine 
is a relatively new drug in the Dutch heroin scene. Consequently, the knowledge about 
cocaine use may be still underdeveloped. 
<p>
Many of the described rituals and rules are developed in the drug scene during a long process 
of casual information exchanges in informal networks --generally not based on objective 
information, but on personal experiences of users. Frequently the source of such information 
is not traceable and for many users its validity is hard to check (11). Therefore, many rules 
and ritual procedures contain rational and non-rational elements. In both cases they are 
supposed to have an impact on the outcome of the ritual. In actuality, they may or may not 
have such effects. 
<p>
In his 1970s study on the determinants of controlled and uncontrolled drug use, Zinberg 
already argued that even "the most severe alcoholics and addicts ... do not use as much of the 
intoxicating substance as they could." He stated that "[s]ome aspects of control always 
operate" (12). The results of the present study reveal that, in fact, the observed activities 
surrounding the intake of drugs are, to a large extend, directed at safety and self regulation.

As explained in chapter four, observing (parts) of the drug ingestion sequence may elicit 
recognition and specific thoughts and feelings in a user, that are unknown to non users. Such 
references may be very strong and can induce drug craving, which, in turn, may lead to drug 
use. Even the sight of disposed drug paraphernalia, such as scraps of aluminum foil or an empty 
lemon juice bottle can have such effects. To users these objects have meaning beyond their 
appearance or actual function. They are symbols for a state of consciousness favored above that 
without drug use. Ex-users are often also very susceptible for such signs of drug use. This 
chapter investigates the special meaning of the drug use rituals at the level of the individual 
user. 
<p>

<a name="obj"></a>
<b>The Ritual Objects</b>
<p>
Most users (and also ex-users) of (illegal) drugs will normally speak positively about the actual 
effects of drug taking when such matters are discussed in a non-judgmental atmosphere (1). The 
frequent expression of these positive attitudes in the celebratory use of paraphernalia related to 
the administration sequence is a strong indicator of special meaning. Not only have certain 
paraphernalia developed into "shorthand emblems" (1) for specific drug user identities (the little 
coke spoon around the sniffers neck; a tattoo of a syringe, a T-shirt with cannabis leafs) but the 
actual use of these tools themselves --going through the ritual procedures and sequences-- may 
in fact add a large part to the effect. As Goldenweiser remarked, such actions generate "an 
overproduction of thought, emotion and activity. The elaboration of these processes is 
accompanied by pleasurable emotion, it becomes an end in itself" (2). This may add to the 
explanation of the frequent practice of booting. Another good example is the construction of the 
pipe by chasers. Although the specifications of this essential tool are dictated by pragmatic 
considerations, many users put a lot of care and precision in making such a pipe; the process is 
subject to a great degree of stylization and a good end result often gives overt satisfaction. Users 
are usually not very eager to share their pipe as these are rather fragile and might get fucked up 
by uncareful use. 
<p>
Certain users' preoccupation with the preferred type of syringe can also be explained in ritual 
terms. The most commonly used syringe in Rotterdam is a 2 ml disposable with a detachable 
needle of 0.5 x 16 mm (5/8 x 25 "). Most IDUs prefer this 2 ml and for that reason it is 
dispensed by the municipal needle exchange schemes. A minority of IDUs favor the slimmer 1 
ml insulin syringe with a thinner (0.36-0.40 mm.) fixed needle. Such preferences can be very 
strong as the following fieldnote depicts:
<p>
<blockquote>A male IDU of  35 years enters the Needle Exchange and asks for a syringe. He 
is handed a 2 ml two-piece pack. He asks if there are 1 ml insulin syringes available, as he does 
not use the 2 ml type. When he is told that only the 2 ml type is dispensed, he returns the 2 ml 
syringe and leaves. </blockquote>
<p>
This excerpt indicates that, from a harm reduction perspective, availability of several types of 
syringes at needle exchanges is important. In the next excerpt two IDUs explain their syringe 
preference:
<p>
<blockquote>Sjef tells he prefers the 1 ml type: "I prefer them because I've always used them. I 
feel more secure handling it, I'm experienced in using it." Jack: "I prefer the 2 ml spikes. I can't 
handle the other ones, they're so fragile. I find it harder to pull back the plunger and so." 
</blockquote>
<p>
Jack's explanation is in terms of the physical properties of the instrument. However, a careful 
look at Sjef's explanation shows that his reasons also focus on the symbolic meaning. 
Explanations such as "I've always used them" are much alike those often used by devotees to 
explain religion and other customary behavior --That is just the way things are; It is the custom; 
We follow the liturgy of the church. "Ritual is commonly validated by its supposed antiquity" 
(3). The phrase "I feel more secure handling it, I'm experienced in using it" not only refers to a 
standardized pattern of syringe use, but also illustrates the anxiety reduction properties of the 
familiar syringe (4). Thus, for Sjef the preferred type of syringe has ritual value, as it enhances 
and thus symbolizes a positive outcome of the ritual sequence. Again, a blend of instrumental 
and symbolic motivations is found.

<b>The Ritual Sequence</b>
<p>
Another indicator of special meaning is that parts of the ritual sequence for many users seem 
just as important as the complete process. Durkheim already observed this phenomenon in his 
early studies of religion. He wrote "When a sacred thing is subdivided, each of its parts remains 
equal to the thing itself. ... [I]t has the same powers, the same efficacy" (5). In the highly secular 
drug subculture under study here, it was not expected to find examples that fit this description 
completely. However, a rich gamut of examples that illustrate the point was found. For some 
users the quality of certain parts of the drug taking sequence is indicative for the results of the 
whole procedure. For example in the following example the quality of heroin is judged on how 
it runs along the aluminum foil while heated:
<p>
<blockquote>In the mean time Achmed shows him how good the dope runs on the tin-foil "You 
see, I told you, it's always good with him (the dealer)". </blockquote>
<p>
There may be a relationship between the purity of the heroin and it's behavior on the aluminum 
foil, but again this lore is not based on objective information, although it is a widely spread 
belief among chasers. That there is a real relationship between means (running on foil) and ends 
(good quality heroin) is questionable as during the fieldwork the community fieldworker came 
across an adulterant with exactly this valued specification. After winning the confidence of a 
middle level dealer, he was shown a powder, having the specifications of ideal heroin. It 
exhibited the consistency and light brown color, associated with so called Stuif Paak, a 
Pakistani heroin and it melted and ran along the foil as only heroin of exceptional quality is 
rumored to do, without leaving a trace. But it had no psychoactive effect whatsoever. The dealer 
was aware of the beliefs and practices of chasers and told the fieldworker that this powder is 
used for adulteration in order to take advantage of the demand for good running heroin. 
Likewise, some smokers relate cocaine's effect to the taste and numb feeling that it produces:
<p>
<blockquote>"When I smoke and I don't get that certain taste in my mouth I won't get high 
from that coke it's hard to describe, I have to feel it in my lips and in my throat, and if I don't 
feel it, I won't get stoned from it".</blockquote>
<p>
Cocaine may, however, be cut with related substances (e.g. procaine) that do cause a numbing 
effect but do not have the same psychoactive effects. Again, the behavior does not fit a means-
end schedule. 
<p>
In the next example John visited a friend one night. He brought along a little heroin:
<p>
<blockquote>John showed a little heroin and proposed to smoke it. First his friend agreed, but a 
few minutes later he said "Maybe better not, I have to work tomorrow morning." John, who 
already had started to prepare for smoking got a little out of balance and, looking disturbed, he 
said "What are you doing now? You can't do that. Don't break the ritual." </blockquote>
<p>
This Garfinkelian breach of the ritual (6) revealed that, for John, the start of the drug use 
sequence resulted in an increased craving for the drug. Often short before the administration of 
drugs, users get highly aroused (7). When involved in conversation, some users cease talking 
and may even get annoyed when others continue. They want to concentrate on the task at hand 
and the anticipated state of consciousness --a major function of ritual (4). As one IDU 
explained: 
<p>
<blockquote>"As soon as I put it on the spoon my stomach turns around and I know it's gonna 
happen, I'm gonna feel that intense rush." </blockquote>
<p>
Such strong reactions are not unusual. An ex-user explained how, in the time shortly after her 
detox, she would start to crave when she received her salary. She did not dare to go on the 
streets with money in her pocket --for her money equaled dope. Similar accounts have been 
described before (8). She also reported that one time, three years after her detox, when she was 
walking on the street in a neighborhood with high drug activity, she had to throw up after 
smelling a wasted shot. During the fieldwork such physical reactions were also observed:
<p>
<blockquote>When Achmed took his first 'zucht' (sigh=smoke), Nadir was shivering. Nadir 
touched Achmed saying: "did you see that, just from the smell I get cold shivers and chicken-
skin", and he shows it to him, "I have that especially when I'm sick, what a reaction isn't it". 
Achmed says he is familiar with it too. </blockquote>

<b>Ritual Drug Combinations</b>
<p>
Many drugs are often combined in shared administration rituals. The combination of heroin and 
cocaine is most evident in the study sample, but other drugs are combined also. The use of 
methadone, prescription drugs and alcohol in various combinations is a notorious example, 
especially favored by impoverished users, who cannot afford heroin and cocaine. Chasers 
frequently combine their heroin and/or cocaine use with intensive tobacco smoking. Monroe, 
for example, always lit a filter cigarette before she started chasing. While chasing, she took 
some puffs, but often the cigarette just burned up in the ashtray. For numerous users, smoking 
cigarettes is strongly associated with heroin or cocaine use and after quitting these drugs, they 
frequently noticed drug craving when smoking tobacco. One former heavy cocaine user, who 
smoked the drug in Marlboro cigarettes, reported that months after he stopped smoking cocaine, 
he would often still taste cocaine when smoking a Marlboro. Likewise, two smokers of tobacco 
and cannabis (not involved in this research) classified themselves as nicotine addicts, but said 
they smoked cannabis only recreationally. Because of the harm associated with regular tobacco 
smoking and their awareness of these effects on their body and performance, they 
(independently) decided to stop smoking tobacco, but continued the use of cannabis. However, 
in the Netherlands cannabis is generally smoked in hand-rolled joints with tobacco. They tried 
smoking pure cannabis from a pipe, but did not like this as they often had to cough, because of 
inexperience with the distinct smoking ritual and they missed the feeling of the joint (and of 
course also the cigarette) between their fingers which they associated with sociability. 
Therefore, their continued recreational cannabis use hampered their efforts to stop smoking.

<b>The Power of Ritual</b>
<p>
Many users are well aware of the symbolic power imposed on parts of the ritual sequence or 
objects essential for the performance of the sequence. The following IDU started working as 
doorman at a house address where only smoking was allowed. He tells:
<p>
<blockquote>"I stopped shooting up two days ago", he tells, "... I quit kinda radically; I brought 
back the container and the box of syringes to the exchange program." </blockquote>
<p>
By removing the essential paraphernalia he prevents the onset of the ritual sequence. It would 
probably have been a greater effort and cost much more stress to abstain from injecting, if a 
syringe would have been available. A similar process seemed to be at work in the case of 
Monroe. Monroe had relapsed into heroin use after she detoxed and was clean for some months. 
Just as before quitting, she chased her heroin. Prior to her detox Monroe was very 
uncompromising about her aluminum covered pipe and smoking foil. These tools had to satisfy 
her strict specifications. After her relapse she however only used a rolled up piece of thick 
paper, something she would not have done before detoxing. When she was asked about this 
discrepancy she explained:
<p>
<blockquote>"Then it becomes such a ritual again and I do not want that to happen. For me that 
would be a sign of being completely into it again. You know, saving the interest for the next 
morning, etc." </blockquote>
<p>
For Monroe the aluminum covered pipe acted as a strong symbol for the demanding lifestyle 
she was trying to give up. 
<p>
In chapter four it was shown that drug craving can have an effect on the performance of parts of 
the ritual. The preceding examples demonstrated that ritual and it's distinguished parts, drug 
paraphernalia, ritual places and situations in which drugs were used and other related cues can 
also influence craving. Many, for the superficial observer, insignificant cues can elicit drug 
craving and subsequent use. For that reason, users who try to regain control over their drug 
intake limit their exposure to certain stimuli associated with their drug use rituals. They may 
avoid certain places or even move to another town. Often people try to avoid meeting their 
(former) using buddies: 
<p>
<blockquote>"I really tried to stay out of his way, but every time I met Hank I felt the urge 
coming up. I knew we were gonna do cocktails and that's what happened, each time we ran into 
each other".</blockquote>
<p>
All these phenomena are related to the specific mindset produced by the performance of the 
ritual sequence. The ritual and its parts focus attention by suppressing or excluding distractive 
thoughts and stimuli. Thereby it appeases motivational conflict, curtails anxiety and fear and 
increases confidence in a good result of the task at hand (4, 9) --the high longed for. This 
phenomenon is again not limited to illegal drug use. For example, many users of tobacco who 
try to stop smoking find this especially difficult in certain situations (e.g. at parties or when 
offered a cigarette by an ignorant), at moments that are normally associated with smoking 
(getting up in the morning, after completing a certain task, or after dinner), or when using drugs 
that are often combined with tobacco (e.g. coffee or alcohol). The drugs may be different, the 
ritualized complex of physiological, psychological and social processes resulting in craving, 
drug seeking behavior and drug use, is alike.
<p>
"Special meaning is [also] indicated by either obsessive performance of the ritual, or continued 
performance ... after the rationale is no longer present" (1). Such examples of what may be 
called hyper ritualization were also observed during the fieldwork. Chasers can sometimes get 
really upset when the heroin does not run well on the foil or chars quicker than expected, which 
is taken as an indicator of poor smoking quality. But most examples concerned IDUs. In 
particular older ones, who have few accessible veins left. In chapter six it was presented that 
they continue injecting until all veins are used up. With injecting careers sometimes exceeding 
twenty years, for some the needle has become an integral part of their life and the most 
dependable source of comfort and security. They will carry on injecting just for the feeling of 
the needle:
<p>
<blockquote>Bennie was trying to shoot up but it wasn't working out very well. His right arm 
was tied off with a belt. There were three large injection sites on the outside of his underarm. In 
one he was searching for a vein. The syringe contained a mixture of a heroin solution and a little 
blood. He continued searching for at least 20 min. In the meantime he was participating in the 
conversation. Then he examined his other arm for a willing vein. He looked concentrated at his 
left hand, turning it in the light. He tried a spot on the back of the hand, but after a while he gave 
up, took a piece of tin foil from the table, put some brown powder (heroin) on it and started 
chasing through a crummy tinfoil pipe. When prompted, he explained "It is not working out, 
because I am not all that concentrated, when I go to the bathroom I'll fix up in no time." His 
inability to shoot up didn't seem to arouse him at all. On the contrary, he stayed calm and 
relaxed. He may well have enjoyed just playing with the needle. </blockquote>
<p>
Bennie seemed in the middle of giving up injecting. Judging the discrepancy with his obvious 
inability to hit a vein, his explanation seems merely self-deception, which may well be part of 
the process. The crummy pipe indicates that chasing is still only viewed a necessity, while 
pleasure remains pursued by injecting. Bennie did not seem to suffer pain or anxiety --he did not 
display visible signs of pain or disturbance. For that matter, he (or this event) may be an 
exception:
<p>
<blockquote>On his arm Gus had some smaller and larger abscesses and trying to take a fix he 
needed to be alone without talking around. When it wasn't working out he got very aroused and 
angry. His partner, Ria Vis with whom I sat in the living room (Gus was in the bedroom) said 
that this happens all the time. "He's stubborn, if he just asked me I'll help him and then its 
done". "It looks like you enjoy it", she shouted to the bedroom. "In the end he asks me anyway, 
wait and see." ... And so it happened. </blockquote>
<p>
Some users were observed to inject solutions that contained quantities of the drug, too 
minuscule to sort an effect:
<p>
<blockquote>He cuts the plastic bag open to get the remaining coke out. There is only a little 
left on the plastic. With a knife he carefully scrapes the coke from the plastic. It is almost 
nothing. He takes the filter from the spoon and wipes off the plastic and the knife. Then he puts 
the filter back in the spoon. There is even a little flint of plastic in the spoon. "There's coke on it, 
it will come off in the water." Now he checks the table for coke crumbs. He finds two, picks 
them up and adds them to liquid in the spoon. "I wonder if I will feel a thing from this." ... He 
tries four spots before he hits a vein. Then, while booting looses the vein several times. Finally 
he stops and takes the needle out of his arm. ... "It's to less, I don't feel a thing. Tomorrow I've 
got money again. Then I can buy heroin and cocaine again. When I shoot cocktails I shoot less." 
</blockquote>
<p>
Not only does this user shoot a quantity of which he must know that it will not sort an effect, he 
is also booting, although, due to the condition of his veins, this is very difficult and he runs the 
risk of wasting the whole shot. Moreover, he is checking the table for cocaine crumbs he might 
have missed. Some users can get really obsessed with this activity. During the fieldwork at the 
house addresses only one other example of such frantic and obsessional behavior was observed. 
At the Central Station, where the more marginalized and often homeless drug users hang out, 
this "digging for diamonds" (10) is more common. There it has even drawn the attention of the 
surveying police officers, who have named people acting like this chicken (11). Such behavior 
is traditionally associated with intensive use of stimulants (12). In the current study mainly with 
heavy use of cocaine. Most users are aware of the obsessional quality of cocaine. In particular 
when binging on the drug obsessive thinking may interfere with the desired high, as this user 
explained:
<p>
<blockquote>"There I go again with that coke, I just took a shot. Often the needle is still in my 
arm and I'm in the flash. But already I'm thinking about the next shot. You're so busy with the 
next one that you ruin the flash you're in." </blockquote>
<p>
In the Rotterdam scene this is referred to as the famous last shot. The cocaine rush is ruined by 
anxious and distractive thoughts about where and how to get more.

<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
This chapter presented evidence of symbolic elaboration in solitary drug use ritual. It should, 
however, be understood that not all research participants experience these phenomena in the 
same degree. For example, to some users the order of the administration sequence is of main 
importance, whereas others just want to get the drug into their body. Therefore, as with any 
form of ritual behavior "Intragroup variation in the extent to which the event is perceived as a 
ritual" can also be expected in drug use rituals (1).
<p>
Learning processes play an important role in ritual. For the last forty odd years, behavioral 
scientists have emphasized conditioning factors in drug use and especially in relation to relapse 
after detoxification (8, 13, 14, 15). Based on these studies several extinction procedures have 
been designed and evaluated with varying results (16, 17, 18). However, such approaches have 
often omitted the social dimensions of the rituals of drug users. The functions rituals fulfill in 
the given social space and their effects on the collective consciousness of the community of 
users are frequently not considered. In the next chapter the analysis will focus on the social 
functions and meanings of drug taking rituals.

<b>Social Drug Use and Social Structure</b>
<p>
With other humans, users of heroin and cocaine share an overriding need for warmth, contact, 
interaction, (group) identity and social solidarity (1, 2). In that respect they do not differ much 
from users of other drugs, such as tobacco, alcoholic beverages and cannabis products. Group 
use of drugs (legal or not) is a universal practice (3) to initiate and potentiate situations that 
satisfy the above needs by engendering feelings of togetherness, identity and solidarity. 
Social drug use serves as a social lubricant and thus as a ritual binding mechanism (4, 5). An 
important difference can be found in the status of the drugs and the legally sanctioned 
opportunities offered for their use. Some drug use is integrated in culturally defined and 
legally sanctioned social structures, built on a history of experience with use and misuse. 
Tobacco can be used in almost every social group or gathering (although there is a recent 
trend to limit smoking in public places, e.g. by forbidding smoking in administrative office 
buildings and creating smoke free zones in restaurants and trains). Group use of alcohol is an 
important feature of many human interaction, in particular at festivities, receptions, and in 
leisure time. Moreover, there are many designated places for alcohol use, e.g. cafes, bars and 
dancings. A well defined set of social controls has been developed surrounding the use of 
these two substances (6). In The Netherlands such provisions are even created for the use of 
the relatively new drug cannabis in the form of so called coffee shops that offer the 
opportunity to buy and use this drug. In an increasing number of cafes and dance clubs the 
use of cannabis is nowadays normalized. 
<p>
For the use of illegal drugs, such as cocaine and heroin such venues do not exist. Society at 
large does not know how to deal with the use of these drugs and, as a consequence, does not 
provide its users with guidelines and models for socially accepted and controlled use of these 
drugs (7). Likewise, legally sanctioned or tolerated social structures for the use of these drugs 
are absent. This does, however, not mean that such controls do not exist. Nor does it mean 
that a social structure for the use of heroin and cocaine is absent.

<b>The Social Structure of Illegal Drug Use</b>
<p>
In addition to the processes described in chapter two (2.3.3, 2.3.4) the notion of social 
structure is also of importance for this study. A social structure can be defined as an ordered 
series of social relationships (being defined as existing between two or more individuals if 
there is some harmony in their individual interests) or a system of values (8). Undoubtedly, 
there is some harmony in the individual interests of users of illegal drugs and therefore each 
individual drug user has a value for the others. This will result in a community with similar 
interests or "an agreement upon certain recognized values" (8). In the drug using community 
these values include a positive attitude towards drugs and the associated patterns of use. But 
because of the illegal status, survival and secrecy will be equally important and these can 
sometimes conflict with the former two. The drug subculture can further be described as an 
adaptive mechanism which enables drug users to live an ordered social life in the 
environment given by the conditions of drug prohibition (9). Malinowski described this 
adaptive mechanism as two-fold: 
<p>
<blockquote>"Firstly, there is the primary or external adaptation which consists in man's 
adjustment to his geographical environment and is motivated by his basic biological and 
physiological needs --the instrumental imperative. Secondly, there is the secondary or internal 
adaptation which is motivated by the integrative imperatives --that is, the necessity for 
harmonizing the conflicting needs and aspirations of man." "The former type of adaptation is 
evidenced in all the various economic, political, educational and legal activities of human 
beings. The latter type of adaptation is in fact the integration into normatively regulated social 
behavior of all such activities of man which his instrumental imperatives urge him to perform." 
"It must be emphasized that this adaptive mechanism (culture) is always end-oriented, the end 
being the satisfaction of man's primary and secondary needs; and furthermore, that each and 
every constituent of it has a definite form and function as determined and defined by the cultural 
context which in its turn is to be understood with reference to the social configuration to which 
it (the culture) belongs."</blockquote>
<p>
When this functionalistic perspective is applied to illegal drug use the instrumental 
imperative becomes clear --drugs. This basic need of drug users is thus the driving force of 
the subculture. As an adaptive response to a hostile environment --represented by mainstream 
society's drug laws and their enforcement-- drug users have developed their own specific 
channels to secure the relatively undisturbed use and acquisition of drugs. Moreover, the 
stigma (10) or deviant label (11) attached to the use of these drugs, thwarts participation of its 
users in conventional social structures, leading to increasing active involvement in the social 
structure formed around this stigmatized and deviant activity --the subculture. The universal 
need for interaction, solidarity and harmony --the integrative imperatives-- will then lead to 
the integration of drug use in a subcultural set of rules and rituals ultimately aimed at the 
maintenance of this social structure that is essential for the satisfaction of drug users' needs. 
<p>
<a name="rule"></a>
<b>Social Rituals and Rules Surrounding Group Drug Use</b>
<p>
And in fact, the preceding theoretical deduction is supported by the data as explicit rituals and 
rules have evolved around the most apparent need of drug users, in particular around use and 
acquisition of the preferred substances. Most of these rituals and rules are normally not 
explicitly defined. Seldom are they discussed by the research participants. When discussed, it 
is mostly when they are broken, in initiations, or in other special situations. They are part of 
the stock of knowledge that the experienced user utilizes in his everyday dealing with the 
social space he is living in. "The values [or rules] that prompt or sanction the performance of 
ritual are also ... the same values that motivate people in their everyday life" (12). Rituals and 
rules are often closely intertwined (13) expressing the same cultural elements, each one 
amplifying the other (14). For these reasons radical separations between the two can, in most 
cases, not be made (13).
<p>
<i>Ritual Places --The House Address</i>
<p>
Social drug use rituals are performed at places where drugs are sold, where people hang out, 
use drugs and socialize. Such places are important locales of the subculture. In Rotterdam 
most drug sales occur at house addresses, and at these addresses it is generally allowed to use 
the purchased drugs. Besides at house addresses people use at home, their friends homes, 
abandoned buildings and other public places. These places are also frequented to meet friends 
and socialize. Figure 9.1 shows where the observed drug administrations were recorded. 
<p>
Figure 9.1
<p>
Although IDUs use their drugs much less frequent at house addresses (frequently they are not 
allowed) than smokers and more at home, a friends home, or in public places, it can be 
ascertained that house addresses in particular serve an important function in the social 
structure, as they combine two important elements --purchasing drugs and socializing with 
other drug users. The average house address is located in a rented house, or a squat waiting 
for renovation. The resident allows a dealer to sell at his place and in exchange he gets free 
drugs and sometimes some money. House addresses often move around. One user, who was 
involved in dealing, alternately as the dealer and as the one providing the place, called this a 
spreading of the risk to prevent police detections and busts. 
<p>
<i>The Rotterdam Police Policy Towards House Addresses</i>
<p>
In Rotterdam many of the house addresses are actually known by the police. The places are 
sometimes visited by police officers, who come to look for a certain person, or to see what is 
going on: 
<p>
<blockquote>Doug and Harrie report about a visit yesterday of two police detectives from the 
narcotic squad. Doug tells "They didn't do nothing, they made a nice chat. They saw Harrie 
busy with making a package for a customer. He was taking out cocaine from the bag with a 
knife and put it on a paper. They saw it and didn't do anything. They told Harrie to keep things 
quiet around here. And they were happy for me that I could make my dope by doing this. They 
said they had noticed, they hadn't seen me on the streets for some time, making my money. "It's 
better you stay here"; they told me". He continues: "What do you think what a difference it 
makes to me, socially and financially. I'm staying out of the hands of the police. Keep more 
money in my pocket, don't have to hustle all day, be out on the street constantly, etc". Harrie 
confirms that he feels the same way. He hasn't been dealing always, just a couple of months 
now. He says: "Now I can stay out of the criminal circuit through this dealing". </blockquote>
<p>
Apparently not only drug users make a distinction between consumption level dealing and the 
criminal circuit. It is evident that the house addresses can only exist by the grace of this 
pragmatic policy of the Rotterdam Police. This policy is based upon the Dutch national drug 
policy, that is not aimed at eradication of the drug problem, but at it's containment and 
management of drug-related problems (15, 16). At the local level this resulted in a policy that 
tolerates the use and sales of heroin and cocaine within certain, rather vague, limits. House 
addresses where these drugs are sold and used are often condoned as long as there is no 
trafficking in stolen goods, no sales of large quantities or too many customers and, related to 
that, above all, no unacceptable nuisance for the surrounding residents. This policy is also 
communicated to the users. In the following fieldnote the researcher witnessed a visit of a 
uniformed police officer to a house address, that was busted for dealing the week before. That 
morning, the residents of the place were released out of custody. While one of the residents 
prepares an injection of heroin, the policeman explains why the place was busted:
<p>
<blockquote>"It was because the neighbors had complained and it is the police policy to shut 
down dealing places when they cause to much nuisance." He warns Karel not to let another 
dealer start dealing again. "It is a question of our credibility to the neighborhood", he says. 
"Send addicts who want to buy drugs to Curly's place (which is a few blocks across the street). 
Let their neighbors have the trouble for a while. If it starts here again, we will crack it down 
immediately."</blockquote>
<p>
The explanation of this police officer reveals a core of the Rotterdam drug policy --reduction 
of drug related nuisance. It furthermore shows the awareness of the police of other dealing 
places --in this case at Curly's house.
<p>
<i>The Organization of the House Address</i>
<p>
A house address is normally ran by a dealer and his staff. The staff exists at least of a 
doorman and a guard to prevent robberies. Sometimes there are two guards, another person 
behind the weigher or a go for --someone who does shopping and delivers messages. In 
general, they are paid in drugs. Often the resident fills one of the positions. There are a few 
different types of house addresses. At the most common type drugs are sold and smoking the 
purchased drugs is allowed. At these places, smoking paraphernalia, such as aluminum foil, 
ammonia or baking soda and spoons (to prepare cocaine for smoking), toilet paper or tissues 
and water are supplied as a service to the customers. At a minority of house addresses 
injecting is allowed, generally, when either the dealer and/or the resident are IDUs. Often a 
separate room is designated for that purpose. At some places where injecting is permitted, 
injection paraphernalia and chemicals were available for common use, such as spoons, water, 
acid (lemon juice or ascorbic powder) and sometimes clean syringes and needles, which were 
supplied by a nearby outreach and needle exchange program (see chapter fourteen). 
Sometimes one can only use drugs bought elsewhere, because drugs are not sold at the place. 
There are no clear cut borders between these types and the situation can change from the one 
into the other, often depending on the people who run the place. There are no explicit charges, 
such as entrance fees or for the use of paraphernalia, which are normal in comparable 
American shooting galleries (17, 18, 19).
<p>
Most house addresses have a clear layout with the intended purpose to separate the dealing 
from the using so that the dealer can easily survey the situation (Figure 9.2).
<p>
Figure 9.2
<p>
When the dealing and using happens in the same room, the table of the dealer typically stands 
in a corner, separated from the table or couch designated for using:
<p>
<blockquote>The dealing is taking place in the back room. At this moment Lottie, a Surinamese 
woman is selling. She sits on a couch that's standing against the window side. In front of here a 
low, square, white table. On the other side of the room stands another couch, in front of it a little 
wooden table with two more chairs around it. This 'corner' is used by the customers to smoke 
their dope. </blockquote>
<p>
Sometimes different rooms or even different floors are used. 
<p>
<i>Rules and Ritual Interaction at House Addresses</i>
<p>
As a rule, only one or two customers are allowed to enter the dealing room or take place at 
the dealer's table at the time. When the transaction is completed the customer must leave this 
room or table. He can then either leave (IDUs often do) or take a seat at the for smoking 
designated area:
<p>
<blockquote>Someone is coming up the stairs. The guard asks the boy on the couch to leave. " 4 
people up here is too much, we allow 2 customers at the same time in the attic room. The others 
have to wait downstairs. Normally you also can't use here, you have to do that downstairs." 
</blockquote>
<p>
From the guard's explanation not only the rule becomes clear, but also that it is not always 
equally applied. Friends, (very) steady customers and other high status users are often invited 
for a chat and a smoke at the dealers table: 
<p>
<blockquote>Jack has just brought in a new client, who orders a quarter gram heroin. ... Lottie 
empties the scale by putting the heroin into a paper. ... She tells the new client that if he wants to 
smoke he has to go to the use corner on the other end of the room. ... In contrast, Jack is allowed 
to smoke at her table. </blockquote>
<p>
A further rule allows only for a certain number of people using their drugs at the place. This 
limit can vary by place and time. Most dealers are stern innkeepers. Unless he has a 
distinctive relationship with the dealer or the resident, the person that came in first is 
summoned to leave by the doorman or dealer (after a reasonable period of time) when the 
maximum number of people is reached. During the observations it was not observed that 
people disputed the basic premise of these two rules:
<p>
<blockquote>After a while Boris asks a customer to leave. The man says that he will after his 
chineesje is finished and so he does. </blockquote>
<p>
By limiting the number of people present, the dealer and his staff can not only survey and 
control the place to a greater extend, it also preserves a good atmosphere by preventing 
tension originating from hectic bustle. This is especially important when large amounts of 
cocaine are consumed. While drug use at house addresses is frequently characterized by a 
sociable pub-like atmosphere, when heavy cocaine use dominates the place communication 
often ceases and there is an imposed silence, as a consequence of the in chapter five described 
increased sensitivity for sound. Sometimes even the light is dimmed. As one experienced user 
explained a novice: "When shooting up cocaine, there has to be some rest and quietness for 
some time." Whether the drug is shot or smoked does not seem to make much difference. The 
next fieldnote was recorded at a dealing place where cocaine was smoked: 
<p>
<blockquote>It's extremely quiet in the room. The doorman is the only one standing and 
walking around. The two windows at the street side have lace curtains. The low table stands on 
the left side of the room. Around it 10 users are sitting, one of them is the dealer who sits in the 
middle of the long end with his back against the wall. Everybody seems to be turned into 
themselves. No one talks with one another. All are smoking or have been smoking cocaine. 
They are all looking straight ahead into nowhere. </blockquote>
<p>
It is not unusual for the doorkeeper to point entering customers at a cocaine dominated 
atmosphere and ask for silence:
<p>
<blockquote>The door is opened by a girl, she's the porter and helps cleaning the place. She lets 
Nadir in, asking him to be relaxed because the people inside are smoking cocaine. In the room 
there is hardly a word spoken, everybody stays very calm and speaks with a low voice. If there 
is any conversation it's about the works on the table: "Can you give me the knife, can I have 
your lighter for a moment, is there some clean water", etc. </blockquote>
<p>
Such warnings are certainly not pointless. When disturbed in their rush cocaine users can get 
irritated:
<p>
<blockquote>Doug sits relaxed in an armchair and enjoys the cocaine rush. A few moments 
later two other users enter the room. They are noisy and uptight because the dealer has already 
closed business and left. The expression on Doug's face (who is still in his rush) hardens: 
"They're screwing up my 'flash'," he says, "Why must they be so noisy?" </blockquote>
<p>
Such a situation can be compared with rambunctiously entering a football canteen crammed 
with supporters who are all highly concentrated watching a cup finale on television. Then 
suddenly turning off the tv, while the star player of their national team is taking the decisive 
penalty. Such a loaded atmosphere can escalate into a sudden outburst of violence: 
<p>
<blockquote>There is suddenly rumor coming out of the living room. For some time two Dutch 
users and a Moroccan are using there. One of the people that are waiting knows that they have 
been smoking cocaine the whole afternoon. That's why they're in that room, it's too crowded in 
here. Suddenly the sound of breaking glass. The waiting room floats empty, most of them go on 
to the street. The Moroccan boy jumped through the window. He was chased by one of the 
Dutch guys armed with a stick. The other Dutch tells: "He is 'para' from the cocaine, he wanted 
him (the Moroccan) to be quiet but he kept on waffling." </blockquote>
<p>
House rules are thus primarily directed at the smooth functioning of the house address --both 
internally and as part of the non-using community. The main objective is to secure the safe 
and undisturbed intake and purchase/selling of drugs. It can be determined that safety in this 
context has a double meaning --safe use, directly related to the intake of drugs and safety in 
relation to the outside. Examples of the former, such as smoking only (smoking is a safer 
mode with a very low chance of overdose), limited number of people present and silence 
when cocaine is smoked can equally be applied to the latter. For example, limiting the 
number of people present not only has a positive influence on the mutual interactions, it also 
makes the situation more controllable for the dealer and it limits the nuisance in the 
neighborhood, which limits the chance of detection and busts. 
<p>
Ritual interaction around the actual purchase of drugs at house addresses is limited. There 
may be some ritual deliberations over the volume of drugs one receives for the money paid, 
the position of the balance on the scale or the respect one has to pay the dealer. In contrast, 
American research indicated elaborate ritual interaction in drug sales, aimed at the detection 
of undercover narcotics officers --often a customer has to shoot up in the dealer's presence to 
assuage (necessary) suspicion (20).
<p>
<a name="shar"></a>
<b>The Ritual Sharing of Drugs</b>
<p>
The most explicit social ritual revolves around the sharing of drugs. Both smoking and 
injecting are commonly done with other people present. The mean number of people present 
at the observed smoking rituals was 5.4, for injecting this was 3.3. In 50% of the observed 
drug administration rituals drugs were shared. The drug sharing ritual can be witnessed in 
many forms. Some approach the formal Durkheimian format (13), others resemble more the 
daily encounters or interaction rituals (21) Goffman referred to and Collins called natural 
rituals. (2) In the following examples the different forms can be observed.
<p>
The first example was recorded at the madhouse, a squat named so by its regular visitors. 
Until short for it's demolition, the place was inhabited by a transient group of older IDUs 
without regular housing. Harrie was one of the few people who lived on a permanent basis in 
the place and served as a manager:
<p>
<blockquote>When Ronald and Frits entered the room they had just bought drugs at another 
address. They wanted to shoot up fast. Frits took his spoon and lemon and put the spoon on the 
table. He then dribbled some lemon on the spoon. Ronald took two little paper packets out of 
his wallet. One contained two stripes of heroin the other contained one stripe of cocaine, as 
Ronald said later. Meanwhile Frits got a fresh syringe. In the house there mostly is a box of 
syringes and a sharpsafe container available. Frits went to a jerrican with water and with the 
syringe (without the needle) he pulled up some water. Then he poured a bit on the spoon. 
Ronald had already opened up the packets and put  half of the heroin in the spoon. Frits heated 
the spoon with a disposable cigarette lighter. After the heroin had dissolved he stirred the 
solution with the safety cap of the needle. Then Ronald threw all of the cocaine into the heroin 
solution and stirred again. After removing the needle, Frits drew up the mixture with his syringe 
through a piece of kleenex. He put the needle back on and gave it to Ronald. Ronald fetched 
another syringe, took off the needle, redrew the piston and put the needle of the loaded syringe 
through the hub of the empty one. He then squirted about 1/4 of the solution into the reservoir. 
After putting the needle back on he gave the syringe to Harrie who offers them and other people 
facilities for shooting up and dealing. Ronald then repeated his action, using again a new 
syringe, but now he divided the remaining 3/4 into two even portions. One for Frits and the 
other for himself. Then they all took the fix. </blockquote>
<p>
As usual, Ronald and Frits share their jointly bought drugs. They inject a mixture of heroin 
and cocaine. Preparing a heroin/cocaine cocktail is a multi-stage and highly determined 
sequence, which requires a sufficient level of concentration and skills. One clumsy move and 
a shot can be spilled. Many users do not want to be disturbed while preparing a shot. Ronald 
and Frits conversely, prepare the shot together. Frits does the actual cooking, but Ronald 
determines how much heroin and cocaine is put in the shot and divides the solution. Frits 
carries the cooker and the lemon and Ronald carries the drugs. Moreover, Not only in the way 
they prepare and use them, but also in the way they buy drugs Ronald and Frits have a 
stereotypical pattern. Four weeks after the above observation one of the researchers was on a 
dealing address, observing the drug sales and use. There he ran into Ronald and Frits again:
<p>
<blockquote>Frits and Ronald came in. They came to score but Ronald started to talk to the 
researcher. After a few minutes, Frits, impatiently, took Ronald's wallet out of his hands. Then 
Ronald (a little agitated) said to Frits "As long as you know that it is my wallet." On asking, 
Frits replied that Ronald always buys the dope and he himself prepares the shots. </blockquote>
<p>
Ronald and Frits must be very confident about each other's actions. They perform the 
preceding preparation sequence with an explicit labor division as can be seen in the schematic 
breakdown of the sequence. 
<p>
Figure 9.3
<p>
During this sequence there was hardly any conversation, no waiting or commands. They were 
both completely focussed on the task at hand. There was absolutely no ambiguity about the 
roles and tasks and both were well aware and certain about their own and their partner's role 
and focus. During the sequence they share one predominant goal --getting high. They can be 
said to share a common mood or emotion. Such a strong mutual focus of attention, without 
ambiguity or uncertainty about each other's role, combined with a common emotion are 
thought to be key ingredients of ritual, having a strong binding effect. (2) 
<p>
And, in fact, Ronald and Frits have a strong and enduring relationship. They are a typical 
dyad or running mates --"a partnership of two best buddies or lovers, in which both 
participants implicitly understand the common benefits of the partnership". (22 23) Ronald 
described his relationship with Frits as follows:
<p>
<blockquote>"Frits and I are almost always using together, we do everything together. We are 
like brothers to each other, he is my half brother you know." "He is 41 now and I am 37; my 
father had a bit on the side then." "We don't share needles but I don't mind using the same spoon 
cause I'm sure that he won't share with someone else." "We're always together except when one 
of us is in jail." </blockquote>
<p>
Their common activities and the synchronicity of intense emotional experiences, such as drug 
induced euphoria and withdrawal secures their strong positive relationship. (19) 
<p>
In the next fieldnote drug sharing takes a much more casual shape. The observation is 
recorded on a dealing address where a group of chasers was sitting around a table in a relaxed 
and sociable atmosphere:
<p>
<blockquote>Around the table are sitting three Moroccan males and the dealer. They are 
chasing some heroin. On the table are a role of aluminum foil, several lighters and a teaspoon 
with a white residuum on the edge. It is used to prepare cocaine for smoking, but currently only 
heroin is smoked. Then two other Moroccans enter the room. They greet the other present 
Moroccans and start a conversation in Arabic. One of them buys heroin ... and starts preparing 
for chasing. He does not have a knife and borrows one. With the knife he takes some heroin 
from the pack and puts it on his friend's aluminum foil. He also gives a little to the other men at 
the table. </blockquote>
<p>
At first hand this may seem an everyday and casual situation, but it has some definite ritual 
aspects. The ritual interaction in this fieldnote centers around two behavioral sequences 
directed at regulating the group interaction--the greeting and the sharing of drugs. The 
greeting ritual is a formal communicative procedure (24) and opens "a channel for 
communication and interaction" and it "defin[es] role and status", (25) in this case at an equal 
level. A conversation is started --a controlled and regular social situation (24) -- and one of the 
newcomers buys some heroin. He not only shares his heroin with his friend that came in with 
him but also with the others at the table. By sharing with the men at the table, the generous 
donor consolidates the good atmosphere, and shows that he respects them and in turn is 
worthy of respect. (21) The situation equals that of the familiar situation of giving a round in a 
cafe. As in any group, among drug users rituals are also directed at the regulation of normal 
day-to-day interaction under the given circumstances. (21) 
<p>

<b>Instrumental Functions of Drug Sharing</b>
<p>
As in solitary drug taking rituals, much of the drug sharing ritual is also aimed at controlling 
the drug experience. The maximizing the drug effect function is expressed in pooling money 
and buying drugs in groups of two or more people. This is a regular practice among dyads 
and other friendship groups but sometimes this is also done by strangers who hook up 
temporarily for this purpose. In the following fieldnote a man ringed at a house where he 
thought to find a dealer. Jack, who squatted the place to sleep in tells him that the dealer has 
moved. Jack continues:
<p>
<blockquote>"But I know an other address. What do you want to buy ?", he asks the man. "I 
want to buy some heroin for 25.-" the man replies. Jack says "I've got some foreign bank notes, 
pounds, dollars. When I bring you to the address can you buy a 'kwart' (quarter gram) for 35.-? 
Then I'll give you the bank notes. The man agrees to buy a quarter and they leave together. ... At 
the address the man buys a quarter gram of heroin and divides the package in about 1/3 for Jack 
and 2/3 for himself. </blockquote>
<p>
In the Netherlands the illegal market in heroin and cocaine is not only dominated by the 
market mechanism at the higher levels of trafficking, but also at the street level. Therefore, 
pooling money results in more drugs for the same amount of money.
<p>
The drug sharing ritual is frequently aimed at preventing withdrawal. This is a common 
practice and users refer to it as helping one another. 
<p>
<blockquote>Achmed tells he's sick and asks Nadir if he got something for him. Nadir says he's 
sick too and wants to use: "I'm not really sick yet, but it's pulling me. If you know a good 
address we can go there together and I will help you". </blockquote>
<p>
One helps a fellow user who is in need of a dose with a betermakertje (a little straight maker -
-a small dose to ameliorate withdrawal). The term betermakertje is mostly used when asking 
a favor from a dealer. Helping does not only refer to preventing or ameliorating withdrawal, it 
can be extended to maintaining the desired level of intoxication. During the entire period of 
fieldwork the research team met few users in a clear state of withdrawal and it was observed 
that helping also referred to sharing cocaine. 
<p>
<blockquote>The young man prepares the cocaine and shares it with his mate. One of the other 
men at the table who just finished his cocaine, asks him "Kun je een puntje voor me missen?" 
(Could you spare me a knife tip) The young one excuses himself for being not able to help him. 
But one minute later he grabs a knife from the table and takes a little bit of cocaine base of his 
foil to put it on the foil of the guy who had asked for it, saying: "Sorry, I can't miss more, we 
already have to smoke from it both".</blockquote>
<p>
<a href="#drug">Top</a>
<p>
<a name="ring"></a>
<b>Rules of Sharing</b>
<p>
Analysis of the observed drug sharing rituals shows that drugs were shared for several 
reasons, inherent to life in the drug subculture. Drug sharing is not only a ritual but also the 
rule among the research participants. The rule regulating the sharing of drugs can be broken 
down to the following subset of sharing rules:
<p>
1.  Share drugs with your partner(s), friends and acquaintances. 
<p>
The drug users that shared drugs were in most cases in some way related to each other, but 
the ties relating them often varied in strength and content. In 68% of the observed drug 
sharing events, they were mainly related through participation in the regular drug taking 
activities, as for example buying and using at the same dealing addresses (N = 93). At dealing 
places users meet friends and make new contacts. Moreover, the relations were often much 
more intense and multiplex, that is, drug users did not only frequent the same places to use 
and buy drugs, but were in more aspects related to each other. For example as sexual partners 
(9%), family (9%), or they lived in the same, sometimes squatted, house (5%). 23% of the 
sharing IDUs were involved in a dyadic relationship. 
<p>
2.  Share drugs with sick users; help them with a betermakertje
<p>
Although mostly practiced among friends and acquaintances, this rule takes drug sharing 
beyond the group of known users. It shows that knowing each other is not a condition per s 
for drug sharing as the next gloss indicates: 
<p>
<blockquote>"I met Karel last week at the Salvation Army. I didn't know him. But I was sick 
(in withdrawal) and he helped me out with some 'bruin'. That never happened to me before, a 
perfect stranger that's willing to help me." </blockquote>
<p>
Helping is a very strong rule. Even when one is not very eager to help a certain person, as the 
following excerpt depicts:
<p>
<blockquote>Jack starts to prepare a shot. When he is almost ready, Cor asks him for a little bit 
of the dope. first J. does not respond, but Cor persists: "Ah, Come on J. just give me a few 
drops" Jack does not seem pleased with the situation, but when he draws his shot through the 
cotton he does not take all the solution from the spoon and pushes the spoon to Cor. 
</blockquote>
<p>
The strength of this rule is demonstrated by the observation that some users actually procure 
the main part of their drugs by asking favors of fellow users, appealing again and again to the 
internalized rule that one helps a sick addict. However, only few of them are able to maintain 
the delicate balance. Sooner or later it will become obvious to their donors that they break 
rule three.
<p>
3.  I help you now, later you will help me
<p>
Users help each other, expecting to get the same treatment when they need help themselves. 
A user who regularly shares some drugs with others has a larger chance of being helped than 
a user who is stingy with drugs. The reach of rule two is limited by the expectancy of 
reciprocity. Former reciprocity is often used as an argument when asking for a favor. 
<p>
4.  Share drugs in exchange for services
<p>
In the first situation presented above, besides splitting the drugs they bought together, Ronald 
and Frits share with Harrie, who offers them the facility to inject and gave them new syringes. 
They do not pay an admission fee for using his facility, nor do they pay for the syringes. 
However, they give Harrie a taste of their jointly bought drugs and doing so they follow rule 
four. Frequently users provide each other with small services in exchange for drugs or other 
services. Permitting other users to use in ones house is a frequently observed example. In 
general, these exchanges go without negotiations or explicit agreements. Providing services 
to others is for some users an important source of drugs, necessary to support their habit. 
Likewise, many users find ways to make some drugs working in various positions for a dealer 
--as doorman, security or go-for. 
<p>
5.  pleasing the dealer
<p>
When purchased drugs are consumed at the place of purchase, smoking users often share a 
little with the dealer. They put a knife tip of heroin or some cocaine base on the dealer's 
smoking foil. The aim of this gesture is to maintain a good relationship with the dealer in the 
hope that he will be considerate in times of short finances by giving a betermakertje. Some 
users, however, object strongly to this practice, such as Arie, an older IDU:
<p>
<blockquote>Arie says he would never beg a dealer for a little more dope. "[T]hat's against my 
feeling of self-respect, ... you got to take care for yourself. Some people will do almost 
everything to get the sympathy from the dealer, hoping they will get some privileges out of it, 
like buying on credit, getting good bags, some extra dope for free, etc. Some dealers exploit 
their position, they act like if they were God himself." </blockquote>
<p>
6.  If you share, do it well
<p>
When drugs are shared, the donor must share in a way so that the recipient gets the 
impression that he is taken serious, as can be witnessed in the next fieldnote:
<p>
<blockquote>Before he goes on, he takes a little cocaine base out of the package he made, and 
puts it in another paper to give it to Lottie. When Lottie sees the little bit in the paper her eyes 
seems to shoot fire. Lottie: "You want to give me that. You insult me with that. If you can't miss 
anything today then say it to me, but don't give me this." The man says he is sorry and he will 
make it up with here next time. </blockquote>
<p>
Sometimes, appeals to share drugs are made when the user, who is being asked, feels he can 
not possibly help, as he does not have enough drugs or money. Then elaborate explanations 
are given why one is unable to help:
<p>
<blockquote>Numa asks Paco for his opinion, "What do you think Paco, last time I met him 
(he's pointing at a Moluccan user of 35 years who is walking towards them.) I had Coke and 
enough money. He asked me to help him, which I did. Now he's asking again. I've got some 
Coke left but I'm out of money. So do you think it's strange I can't help him now." Paco first 
answers he does not want to interfere, but then he says "it's your business if you want to help 
someone or not, you know what you've got and what you can do with it." Numa turns to the 
Moluccan user and says "you see, he understands why I can't help you today. You know 
yourself, when I can, I will help you, you saw that last time. So don't be angry with me, you 
make me feel guilty." The Moluccan user answers "yeah, yeah, I understand ..." </blockquote>
<p>
That unanswerable appeals to share elicit feelings of guilt is a strong indication of the power 
of the sharing rule. However, the sharing rule is, at times, broken, as are other rules and 
behavioral codes. Many drug users at times engage in behavior in which they not only violate 
the rules and laws of the dominant culture, but also of their own subculture. But it is 
insufficient to simply remark that drug users engage in such rule breaking behavior as they 
are not the only group in the population in which this phenomenon occurs. "Situational 
exceptions to idealized cultural standards can frequently be observed throughout various 
sectors of the population ... and [t]hese moral dynamics are not, of course, limited to the 
experience of drug users." (26) Such moral division of labor is also observed in the legal and 
medical professions where, because of the relative differences in status, some lawyers and 
physicians do the dirty work while others of higher status do not and may even condemn such 
activities. (27) "The credibility of the system of ethics embraced by street drug users cannot be 
measured by absolute behavioral conformity any more than the credibility of business ethics 
can be assessed in terms of the absolute absence of fraud." (26) "The concept of norm ... does not 
require a correspondence between what persons say and what they do; discrepancies are to be 
expected. ... [B]ecause norms identify behavior that ought or ought not to occur, behavior 
may (and often does) depart from norms. ... The more relevant consideration includes the 
conditions under which this potential for deviance is realized and the conditions under which 
norms guide specific conduct." (28) Therefore, the circumstances under which the embraced 
rules are violated and the judgments drug users themselves hold regarding these violations are 
of equal importance.
<p>
As the last example showed, a refusal to share is acceptable if one is unable to share (i.c. one 
has a low availability of drugs and money). When one is perceived as being able to share, 
however, a refusal is condemned and may put pressure on a relationship:
<p>
<blockquote>About a week or 3 ago I was here with Harrie. He had one stripe of heroin left, his 
last one. He wanted to share it with me. Then, last week, I was a little bit sick and I asked him a 
'betermakertje'. Meanwhile Harrie had started dealing. Then he says to me, "Sorry Arie, I can't 
do it now, I only have seven grams left." </blockquote>
<p>
Harrie's position and with that his relation with Arie has, however, changed when he started 
dealing. Dealing is not an easy occupation. Not only must a dealing user stay out of the hands 
of the police and hire a doorman and (body)guard to prevent rip-offs, he also has to manage 
the very frequent demands of customers for credit, betermakertjes and other favors. Dealers 
are often wangled by customers who are short of money. But they must control their financial 
balance and anticipate the financial credibility of their customers. Otherwise they are quickly 
out of business. At the other hand, they want to stay on good terms with their peers. This 
makes dealing a stressful activity and only few users manage to stay in business for extended 
periods of time. 
<p>
The ability to conform to the rule of sharing is to a great degree dependent on drug 
availability. (26) Drug availability is, however, a relative notion, dependent on ones position in 
relation to the drugs and the perception of this position by the persons involved.

<b>Symbolic Functions of Drug Sharing: Effects on the Social Consciousness</b>
<p>
These drug sharing rules are all expressions of the almost universal subcultural code of share 
what you have. (29) And indeed, the data provide a broad pattern of sharing behaviors. The 
stereotype of drug users is that of ripping each other off as predatory individuals. While this 
behavior does indeed occur, a more prevalent pattern seems to be sharing. The drug users in 
this research shared many valued items such as housing, food, clothing and money. Often 
they helped one another with daily problems associated with drug user life. For instance, 
homelessness is not uncommon and in some of the places visited for this research several 
homeless drug users were given shelter for a shorter or longer period. One other such problem 
is that many IDUs suffer from collapsed veins and abscesses due to insufficient hygiene. 
Some insist on injecting themselves, others are happy to get help from another, often 
experienced injector, such as the following fieldnote shows: 
<p>
<blockquote>A woman and her partner have just bought drugs and are shooting up. Both don't 
have an easy job. The man is trying several spots to shoot up. She also tries more than one spot 
and finally she asks Ria to do it. Ria takes the syringe, looks carefully at the females arm and 
sticks in the needle. Then she redraws the piston a little and blood runs in the syringe. She has 
hit a vein. After seeing the blood she presses the piston, takes out the syringe and hands it to the 
woman. Shooting up the woman took her very little time and she looked like a professional 
nurse doing her daily work. </blockquote>
<p>
In contrast with similar American examples involving house doctors or professional hitters in 
shooting galleries, there is no commercial trade off in this service. (18 19 30 31) Sometimes, users 
ingest more drugs than their usual dose and slip into a deep nod which can end in overdose. 
They then depend on the safeguarding of a fellow user, like in the next situation:
<p>
<blockquote>In Gus' house are Ria Vis and Jerry, Gus just left to do some shopping. Ria is 
asleep in an armchair. "She has swallowed pills", Jerry says, "she is 'out' now." A Little later Ria 
Wakes up a little. "It's alright Ria just go nicely asleep." Jerry says to her. Jerry is staying with 
her to take care if anything should happen. </blockquote>
<p>
It is clear that the sharing of drugs is an important element of a broader pattern of social 
interaction in the drug subculture. Besides the instrumental functions, described above, drug 
sharing is a way to socialize and to (re)establish relations in the drug scene. In the next 
example, Harrie was just ejected from the crisis center, after a stay of three and a half weeks. 
He drew some money out of the bank, bought drugs and went to Karel's place, where he lived 
before he went into the crisis center:
<p>
<blockquote>"I left for Karel's place to take a shot and to surprise Karel with a little cocktail as 
well. He was still a sleep when I came in and was happily surprised to be wakened up for a 
cocktail." </blockquote>
<p>
By sharing drugs with Karel, Harrie expresses not only that he is back, but also that he is a 
generous and trustful member of the community, who is aware of his obligations to his 
friends and fellow users; their common bond is renewed and their group sentiments are 
reinforced. (32)
<p>
Drug sharing plays a crucial role in the social organization of the drug subculture. This 
observation is not unique as it was also found in other research. (33 34) For example, Sandoval 
found sharing of resources, such as cars, food and drugs to be a common practice among a 
group of "heavy polydrug users": "Customarily when one user had a large supply, he would 
share with his friends as an investment for the times when he had none available. Even the 
dealers who made their livelihood selling drugs were not rigid. They often gave their friends 
free drugs." (34) 
<p>
The important part drugs play in ritual is not limited to users of illegal drugs in modern 
western society, as in some studies of non-western, not primarily drug-driven, cultures, the 
sharing of drugs is also a main feature of social ritual. (35 36) What these traditional cultures and 
the drug subculture have in common is that they all live under harsh and demanding 
circumstances in which valued items are often scarce. (5 33 35 36) The lives of the members 
characteristically "oscillate between states of extreme mental dejection and extreme mental 
joy. Crises, calamities and disappointments of numerous sorts which are ever occurring ..., 
tend to disrupt the normal functioning of life and create a veritable condition of social 
dysphoria. Rituals on such occasions serve to counterbalance the disturbing actions of these 
adverse circumstances and restore social euphoria." (32) 
<p>
The regular performance of the drug sharing ritual ensures continuity and smothers social 
conflicts that are often based on controversies of material origin (money, drugs or other 
valuables). (32 37) The elemental interaction pattern which is reflected in the drug sharing ritual 
is the reciprocal exchange of valued items among members of the same group. (36) This leads to 
the transformation of a multitude of individuals into an effective, relatively stable and 
cohesive social structure. 
<p>
According to Collins "sharing a common mood or emotion" is a basic ingredient of ritual. (2) 
This means that sharing the drug high by sharing drugs is a fundamental condition for "drug 
use as a ritual event" as sharing is a requirement for the development of just that characteristic 
behavioral sequence which all definitions have in common --mechanical, stereotyped, 
repetitive, stylized actions. Sharing drugs results in sharing the common mood of the drug 
high, "an experience or knowledge which cannot be shared or transmitted during the course 
of ordinary social interaction. Sharing drugs has created a special bond similar to the bond 
created in the ritual context". (5) "Drugs also give the users a feeling of identity and a common 
bond ... and [this bond] acts as a strong supportive system for its members." (34) Because drugs 
are shared and ritualized, they have become a potent binding force. (35) Drug sharing not only 
helps to maintain the psychopharmacological balance, but serves an essential purpose in 
defining the social space drug users live their daily lives in --it separates the in-group from 
the out-group. (38) Labeled as structural outsiders and ostracized by mainstream society drug 
users have become mutually dependant for fulfilling basic human needs. As one of the 
research participants expressively phrased it:
<p>
<blockquote>"We help everybody here, black, white, red, yellow, we don't have apartheid here. 
What would become of us if we don't help each other, no one else does". </blockquote>
<p>
Of course, not all users at all times behave conform these community positive rules and 
rituals. Often they are broken. Users cheat each other, rip off their dealing peers or steal  
money and drugs. These community negative behaviors are often the subject of savage 
gossip. As Faupel explained, lack of conformity to subcultural norms is most evident in users 
with limited structuring of daily life and a reduced drug availability. (26) Such situational ethics 
are, however, not unique and have been documented in several other areas and social 
groups. (39 40 41 42) But the failure of drug users to "consistently maintain ethical integrity is 
commonly understood to be evidence for a lack of any normative sensitivity whatsoever". (26) 
As a result, some clinical psychiatrists termed drug users "extremely egoistic cannibals" 
whose "negative, undesirable, destructive, learned behavior" is caused by a junkie-syndrome 
that overrules all other behavior. (43 44 45) However, similar to Fiddle's observations of law 
enforcement personnel, (46) clinicians generally see drug users at their worst. Their observations 
are confined to drug users in clinical settings, users who applied for treatment because they 
could no longer manage their drug use. Furthermore, and this also applies to the negative 
opinions of drug users regarding their peer's behavior, norm conforming behavior is usually 
taken for granted, while it is the deviations from or breaches of the norms that leave the 
strongest impressions. The findings of this study underline the limitations of such 
observations. Junkie behavior is certainly an integral part of the daily experiences and 
behaviors of drug users and many experience a feeling of mistrust, but a subculture cannot 
revolve around merely negative relationships. Positive relationships and interpersonal trust 
are essential for its maintenance. (19) These are generally ritually confirmed and reinforced by 
shared use of drugs --the instrumental imperative of the subculture. (9) 
<p>
This balance between positive and negative behavior is dependent on the perceived drug 
availability. With a sufficient availability positive relationships can be maintained with a 
considerable number of other drug users. When availability decreases this number will shrink 
to a small core around the individual and users will less often share the drugs they crave. 
<p>
Craving for altered states of consciousness has been termed a universal human condition 
comparable to the other primary drives. (47) Just as with food, drink and sex, the acquisition and 
use of drugs is thus of essential importance in the fulfillment of this primary drive. Likewise, 
food, drink, sex and drugs have all served a major role in social ritual throughout history. 
Sharing these items brings people together and strengthens mutual ties. It can therefore be 
argued that drugs have intrinsic or primary ritual value for biological and social reasons. 
When drugs are shared, this generally fulfills the requirements for ritual (prescribed 
psychomotor sequence, special meaning). The from drug sharing resulting common mood --
the drug high-- satisfies desires for intimacy, social solidarity and harmony. As a result, drug 
sharing is a reinforcement of group identity and group cohesion, resulting in the maintenance 
of the drug using network, and ultimately, the drug subculture. As the survival of the tribe is 
an intrinsic goal of all forms of human organization, use and sharing of drugs is a 
fundamental (and normal) human behavioral expression.

<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
Drug use affects the human organism in several ways. A division can be made between 
psychoactive effects such as changes in perception, cognition, affect, and levels of anxiety or 
inhibition, and physical effects like increased or diminished heart function, lung function and 
muscle tension. It is primarily the former effects which make drugs desirable, and are a major 
reason for their use. Some of the physical effects --enhanced and/or enduring bodily 
performance from stimulants; muscle relaxation and/or sleep from tranquilizers-- are sought 
as well. 
<p>
These psychoactive and physical effects are influenced by the dose, administration mode, 
psychological and/or physical condition of the consumer, and the social environment in 
which drugs are taken. (1) Many of the physical effects are termed --because they are secondary 
to the intended effect-- "side effects". Prolonged, and in some cases single, exposure to drug 
effects may result in harm or impairment. Some harm relates less, if at all, to the ingested 
drug itself, than to drug impurities; the mode of administration; or the circumstances in which 
drug use takes place. Because of the illegal nature of most drug use, and the resulting 
insecurities regarding the composition of the ingested substance, the actual cause of harm is 
often unclear.
<p>
This chapter will focus on the physical consequences of illicit drug use. More precisely, 
specific health consequences of the prevalent drug administration rituals will be compared. 
This comparison will not be extensive, and for the most part limited to injecting and smoking, 
particularly chasing. The risk of (fatal) overdose and other physical harm will be considered. 
Communicable diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV, will be only briefly addressed as there is 
little data available to compare the two administration modes. The chapter will conclude with 
a reflection on the relative safety of the different modes.

<a name="over"></a>
<b>Overdose</b>
<p>
<i>Opiate Overdose</i>
<p>
Among drug users, death by overdose is generally linked to the opiates, particularly heroin 
and methadone. The classic depiction of an overdose involves opiate ingestion in an amount 
exceeding (individual) tolerance with resulting respiratory and central nervous system 
depression; miosis (pinned pupils); and consciousness levels anywhere from sedation to 
coma. Whether or not this "pharmacological overdose" is responsible for all deaths which 
occur following heroin administration has been questioned. Alternative hypotheses regarding 
allergic reactions, (2 3) toxic effects of heroin (4) or its diluents (5 6 7) and drug interactions, with 
particular reference to alcohol, (2 4 8) have been formulated. In an overdose study from 
Denmark, alcohol was a contributing factor in 40% of the cases (39% of which were due to 
morphine/heroin, injected 67% of the time). (9) A study of US soldiers stationed in Europe 
found that most "overdoses" were among experienced drug users who took (87% by 
injection) a familiar amount of heroin after a night of drinking, went to bed drunk, vomited in 
their sleep and aspirated some of the vomitus causing fatal (or near-fatal) asphyxiation. (10) In a 
Swiss retrospective study of emergency room admissions for overdose, the vast majority were 
attributed to heroin, but mixed poisonings, in which heroin was most commonly combined 
with flunitrazepam and alcohol, contributed to the clinical picture. (11) 
<p>
A recent Amsterdam study applied the descriptive term, "sudden death after drug use." (12) This 
retrospective study of 175 lethal overdoses divided victims into two groups: persons who died 
shortly after their arrival in Amsterdam (almost all non-Dutch tourists), and those who had 
resided in Amsterdam a long period before death. Following Ruttenber and Luke, (6) the 
overdoses in the former group were classified as epidemic pharmacological overdoses --
tourists not accustomed to the higher potency of Amsterdam's heroin. The deaths among the 
resident group were classified as endemic; caused not so much by potency but by coincidence 
with other factors, such as additional drug use. (12) Poor physical health, a possible co-factor, 
was barely addressed. A recent German study related the increased number of local drug 
deaths (of whom 75% suffered inflammatory diseases and 15% were HIV seropositive) to a 
rise in purity and availability of heroin. The authors stated, "[t]he 'supply' of heroin has 
apparently become so copious that nearly all deaths are caused by overdosage with this 
substance," (13) thus suggesting pharmacological overdose. But, as the Amsterdam study shows, 
purity in and of itself, and high availability, are not sufficient explanations. The large number 
of foreign overdose fatalities in Amsterdam (64%) suggests a lethal combination of low 
tolerance and ignorance of (rising) drug purity levels. It can therefore be ascertained that 
(pharmacological) overdoses are more likely to occur at the start of a period of increasing 
purity (or) when purity is highly unstable. 
<p>
<i>Administration Ritual and Overdose Prevalence</i>
<p>
A look at the administration ritual involved in overdose is interesting. While deaths due to 
oral administrations of methadone, and a combination of codeine and glutethimide (a 
hypnotic) have been reported, (14 15 16) the majority of illicit drug overdose studies refer to 
injected drugs. In the Amsterdam study, the mode of drug administration utilized prior to 
death could only be determined in a minority of cases. Only 54.3% of the autopsy reports 
mentioned signs of recent injecting. In 29.1% of the cases this could not be established, and 
in 16.6% this information was missing (N = 175). Testimonies were available in 42 of the 
heroin use prior to death cases. Among 34 (81%) the lethal dose was injected, in four the 
heroin was sniffed and in only one case it was chased. In the three additional cases the mode 
of administration could not be ascertained. (12) Although these numbers are hardly 
generalizable, they suggest that, at least when considering overdose, chasing is a low-risk 
administration ritual. This suggestion is supported by the relative absence of Surinamese and 
Moroccan users among the deceased (less than 6%, N=175). The prevalence of injecting in 
these user groups is very low, about 4%, in contrast with 37% of Dutch users and 67% of the 
foreign drug users in Amsterdam. (17) The likelihood of this suggestion is further confirmed by 
data from Rotterdam. Table 6.1 (chapter six) shows a similar injecting prevalence in 
Rotterdam --4% of the Surinamese and 6% of the Moroccan users in the ethnographic sample 
injected, in contrast with 43% of the Dutch. Nonfatal overdose of Rotterdam methadone 
clients is registered in the ROtterdam Drugs Information System (RODIS). In 1988, 27% of 
all methadone clients had a lifetime prevalence of overdose, on more than one occasion in 
30% of these cases. (18) In 1989, this percentage had fallen to 23% and the results were broken 
down by ethnic group: overdose prevalence was 29% among Dutch users, 6% for Surinamese 
and Antillians and 10% for Moroccans. (19) The author wondered if the Moroccan clients (and 
those from Suriname and the Antilles) used their drugs in a safer way, but as he found no 
indications of lower levels of heroin use, he doubted that moderation could be an explanation 
for their lower overdose prevalence. Unfortunately, data on the mode of drug administration 
is not registered in RODIS and as a result, differences of administration ritual were not 
considered. Had this been done, the relationship between the low prevalence of injecting in 
these groups and their lower overdose prevalence might have become clearer. 
<p>
The speed with which a drug's effects become noticeable differs per administration ritual: oral 
ingestion is characterized by a slow onset, with a slight increase from sniffing, a more rapid 
effect from chasing, and injecting generally producing the most rapid effects. (20) An exception 
is cocaine, which reportedly reaches the brain even faster when smoked than by injection, 
although technique undoubtedly plays a role. (21 22) It should be noted that there is some variety 
within the specific modes as well: an empty stomach absorbs drugs quicker than a full one, 
intravenous injection offers more rapid delivery than an intramuscular or subcutaneous one. 
<p>
Overdose potential however, does not so much depend on onset speed, as on the total amount 
of drugs ingested over a given time period. A lethal dose can thus be built up in more than 
one ingestion. (4) Although injecting heroin carries the greatest risk for fatal overdose, oral 
ingestion and sniffing probably compete for second place. This can be explained by the fact 
that these two methods work with a buffer; a certain quantity is swallowed or sniffed in one 
go, and then crosses the mucous membranes of the stomach or nose slowly but definitely. 
When chasing, while effects are felt more rapidly then when swallowing or sniffing, the drug 
itself is administered quite gradually. Chasers reach their desired high by sequentially 
administering small quantities of the drug. In theory this could add up to a lethal dose, but in 
practice the chance seems small due to the steady and controlled titration inherent to this 
mode. Chasers may smoke themselves into a light state of unawareness --a nod-- but, as 
illustrated by the following statement, this gradual build-up normally prevents fatalities: 
<p>
<blockquote>"When you nod, you nod. And you can't add on to that level anymore." 
</blockquote>
<p>
Moreover, when chasing, the actual absorption, or bio-availability, of heroin is much lower 
than when injecting, although this is dependent on the chemical form (hydrochloride or base) 
of the heroin, its processing impurities, diluents and the chaser's technique and skills. (23 24) 
<p>
The theoretical possibility of smoking heroin from a "bong" --a pipe typically used to smoke 
cannabis or cocaine, with a chamber where smoke is collected and stored before it is all 
ingested in one inhalation-- as well as the anal route (suppositories, enemas), will be omitted 
from discussion because these methods are not prevalent in Holland.
<p>
<i>Cocaine Overdose</i>
<p>
Despite the assertion made in a recent publication of the Netherlands Ministry of Justice (25) 
there is an overdose risk attached to cocaine, and fatalities do occur. At the physical level, 
cocaine elevates (while heroin decreases) heart rate, respiration and blood pressure. Overdose 
of either drug has a profound effect on the central nervous system: cocaine's is stimulation (22) 
and heroin's, depression. (8) Crudely put, in a heroin overdose breathing stops and the victim 
turns blue; breathing might also stop in a cocaine overdose, but probably not until after the 
flushed victim experiences a "heart attack" or seizure. (26 27 22 28) The physical process 
responsible for the intense "rush" associated with injecting and smoking of cocaine, may 
cause overdose so rapidly that treatment is not possible. (22) A recent American study describes 
cerebral hemorrhage, acute cardiac events, and ruptured dissections of the ascending aorta 
directly related to cocaine. (29) This study, as many others, did not analyze the mode of 
administration involved, making comparison of smoking and injecting in fatal cocaine 
overdose impossible. But fatalities following recreational sniffs, smokes, and shots of cocaine 
have been reported, and well as several in "body-packers". (27 30 31)
<p>
<i>Nonfatal overdose</i>
<p>
The Amsterdam study discussed above found only a small proportion of the reported 
overdoses ( 10%) to be fatal. (12) Almost one in four clients of the Rotterdam methadone 
programs has experienced a nonfatal overdose, 38% more than once. (19) Overdose, thus, is not 
a rare phenomenon. Many (case) reports describe the clinical sequelae of nonfatal overdoses, 
which may induce considerable physical harm. Pulmonary edema is frequently related to non-
fatal overdose of both heroin and cocaine. (32 26 33 34 35 36) Other disorders commonly associated 
with cocaine include (hemo)pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium; 
atelectasis (34 35 37) and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. (38) Arrhythmias and myocardial infarction 
(in persons without coronary disease) have also been related to use of cocaine. (39 40) Non-fatal 
heroin overdose has been associated with acute renal failure caused by rhabdomyolysis, (8 41 42 
36) acute transverse myelitis (43) and lesions of the central and peripheral nervous system. (36 44) 
Aspiration pneumonia, due to emetic properties of the drug itself plus impaired gag response 
common to heroin intoxication, is not uncommon. (8 36) Respiratory insufficiency caused by 
laryngeal edema has been reported, but is apparently atypical. (45) Allergic reactions, in one 
case to a first injection of heroin, (46) are suspected in a large number of these cases. (8 47 48) Less 
severe allergic responses with histamine production can be a nuisance or problem for 
injectors, sniffers, and smokers as will be illustrated in the following section. (49)

<b>Physical Harm Related to Regular Use of Illicit Drugs</b>
<p>
Intensive and prolonged use of heroin and cocaine in non-toxic doses has also been related to 
several clinical syndromes. In the following, some of the consequences of smoking will be 
discussed, ensuing those related to injecting, and finally a brief overview of sniffing-related 
disorders. 
<p>
<i>Smoking</i>
<p>
Most smoking related pathology concerns, not surprisingly, the respiratory system. Thai 
Opium smokers, even at 60 or 70 years of age, were found to be in surprisingly good health in 
a recent American Refugee Committee study. Their only noticeable major complication, 
chronic obstructive lung disease, was thought to have been aggravated by tobacco smoking 
for which long pipes are utilized, requiring powerful sucking and presumably deep 
inhalation. (50) Heroin is the subject of only a few reports. Heroin inhalation has been related to 
cases of bronchospasm (51 8 52) --possibly due to foreign body reactions and/or allergies to 
heroin or added cuts-- and airway obstruction. (53) The deleterious effects of heroin inhalation 
on the condition of asthma patients is described by one report, (54) but another suggests a 
temporal relationship between onset of asthma and heroin use, irrespective of administration 
route. (3) In 1981, a small 'heroin'-leukoencephalopathy epidemic in Amsterdam and some other 
Dutch cities caused the death or irreversible impairment of several chasers. (55 56) What 
precipitated the illness has never been resolved, but one hypothesis related the syndrome to 
the formation of a toxic compound from a combination of unknown cuts during pyrolysis 
(heating). This compound may have been toxic in itself or in combination with other 
compounds occurring in the heroin used. (24) 
<p>
Since the outbreak of crack smoking in America in 1984, the medical literature has produced 
many (case) reports on the adverse effects of cocaine smoking. While the massive area of 
absorbent alveoli in the lungs make smoking an efficient way of administering any drug, 
cocaine can potentially reach the brain faster by smoking than by injection. (22) The difference 
in onset speed may be only a matter of seconds, but is an important consideration for some 
users. (In emergencies and sporting events a few seconds difference is of vital concern, and 
the pursuit of intoxication is viewed by some users as having elements of either. Or both.)
<p>
Disorders commonly related to crack cocaine smoking are cough (sometimes with production 
of blood and/or carbonaceous sputum), shortness of breath, and chest pain. (35 57) Radiographic 
abnormalities associated with these symptoms are apparently uncommon (34) but include those 
pulmonary disorders listed in the non-fatal overdose. (35 33 26) Certain euphoria intensifying 
procedures, such as the Valsalva maneuver, reportedly contribute to development of 
pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum. (58) One case report related freebase cocaine smoking 
to reactive airway disease, (59) but the specific inciting agent (cocaine, its diluents, freebase 
impurities or concomitant use of tobacco) was unclear. A study into the respiratory effects of 
cocaine freebasing among habitual users of marihuana with or without tobacco, suggested 
that moderate cocaine smoking damaged both large and small airways, independent of 
concomitant marihuana use, but synergistic with the effects of tobacco. (57) 
<p>
From these reports, it is not clear if disorders are solely the result of inhaling heroin or 
freebase cocaine vapors. Fumes containing unknown pyrolysis products from heroin cuts, 
from impurities of the freebasing process, or admixtures to the freebased cocaine provided 
prior to smoking, may also play a part. (24 59 3) In The Netherlands, most cocaine-smoking 
heroin users prepare base cocaine for smoking themselves, by heating cocaine hydrochloride 
with ammonia. The inhalation of ammonia residue may well affect the described states. 
Furthermore, chasing from aluminum foil, and smoking from a stem (a glass tube) with a 
steel wool or "brillo" filter, may lead to inhalation of metal (oxide) particles. The possibility 
also exists for upper respiratory problems secondary to the inhalation of excessive heat or 
butane from disposable cigarette lighters. (57)
<p>
<i>Injecting</i>
<p>
Medical reports of injecting related problems are myriad, and varied enough to present 
themselves to almost every discipline of medical practice. Clear relationships between cause 
and effect are sometimes presented. However, due to the illegal status and resulting covert 
nature of injecting drug use, such evident causal relationships are often not traceable. (60) The 
drug-specific, technique-specific and lifestyle-specific variables which impact on users' health 
can be teased apart only with difficulty, if indeed at all, and are frequently confused or 
combined.
<p>
In the injecting drug use culture, intravenous injection --although somewhat more difficult to 
execute-- is the norm. This extra effort pays off in faster delivery of the drug effect, and less 
of the local tissue damage which can occur when injecting relatively impure black market 
drugs intramuscularly or subcutaneously. (61 62 27) Much of the harm related to injecting drug 
use often results from a synergistic combination of limited needle availability, poor hygiene 
surrounding self-injection and inadequate injection technique.
<p>
Injecting with dull needles produces larger punctures than necessary, causing skin, tissue and 
venous scarring in regular or frequent injectors. (63) Repeated use of damaged sites and 
improper injection technique may result in abscesses, ulceration, venous scarring, and 
circulatory damage when veins "clog" (thrombosis) or collapse. (64) Cocaine users are 
particularly suspectable to "missed" (outside the vein) injections due to the drug's local 
anesthetic properties. The same microscopic neurotransmitter effect responsible for cocaine's 
"freeze," cause peripheral veins and arteries to constrict. This decreases both flow of 
oxygenated blood to, and rate of absorption from, the injection site, increasing the chance of 
local tissue necrosis. (65 22) Edema --leakage of lymph fluid in the tissues-- commonly 
presenting as "elephant hand," is a consequence of too rapid introduction of (too much) 
liquid, misses, circulatory damage and over-used sites. This pool of fluid provides a favorable 
medium for bacterial growth, and is particularly susceptible to cellulitis. (66) Inept needle 
placement and manipulation may cause bone cells to grow on muscle fiber, resulting in hard 
tumorlike swellings (myositis ossificans); a phenomena referred to in one reference book as 
"drug abusers' elbow." (67) Because arterial blood leaves the heart under pressure and is housed 
in vessels with thicker muscle walls, arterial injections (usually accidental) are painful, 
require force, can cause severe bruising and, not infrequently, result in both "missed" 
injections and serious infections. (61 62) A tourniquet --employed to bring veins to the skin 
surface and facilitate injection-- used too tightly or too long leads, on short term to bruising, 
and on the long term to tissue damage which may be severe enough to cause gangrene. (68)
<p>
Unsterile skin, syringes, needles and other paraphernalia can introduce a wealth of infectious 
agents. (20 48) Blood-borne diseases such as viral hepatitis and HIV have received sufficient 
media attention to be linked to drug injecting by even a lay audience. Injecting traces of 
another person's blood is however, not the only risk. Organisms common to the skin surface 
can contribute to the development of bacterial infections. Endocarditis, because venous blood 
travels toward the heart taking any injected matter with it, is a particular risk. (69 48 70) Water 
used (among other things) to prepare drugs for injection may provide another source of 
bacteria, virus and other infectious agents. (71) Base "brown" heroin --ideal for smoking-- will 
not dissolve without the addition of an acid (commonly lemon juice, vinegar, or vitamin C 
powder), acids which can produce a certain amount of local irritation, even given a perfectly 
delivered injection. Lemon juice preparations are preferred by some to juice from real 
lemons; users' lore being that lemon fibers can cause blindness if they "get stuck" in the tiny 
capillaries of the retina. This is supported, at least in part, by the research as several outbreaks 
of systemic candida infection, and candidal endophthalmitis causing vision damage or loss, 
have been linked to old, contaminated lemon juice. (72) Idiosyncrasies of technique, such as 
licking the needle prior to injecting, may in themselves be responsible for infection. Wound 
botulism, septic arthritis, tetanus, and numerous other diseases both exotic and mundane, 
have been associated with unsterile injection. (43 13 73 74 20)
<p>
Even skilled injectors with sterile equipment and skin cannot prevent injecting the insoluble 
(and/or harmful) diluents and impurities most black market drugs contain. Talc and 
cornstarch emboli of the retinal vessels, pulmonary talcosis, and some of the granulomas and 
abscesses injectors develop are directly attributable to drug cuts. (13 8 48) Quinine, a heroin cut 
some users favor for the mucous membrane tingle it produces upon injection, has been 
implicated in damage to cardiac, skeletal and smooth muscle, the gastrointestinal tract and 
kidneys, (75 76) local tissue destruction, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, (8) and may 
contribute to toxic amblyopia. (77) Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that cuts are also at 
least partly responsible for some of the neurological lesions, neuropsychological deficits and 
immunological abnormalities associated with drug (usually injected heroin) use. (60 78 79 70) 
Small wads of cotton or cigarette filter, employed to eliminate or reduce the amount of 
insoluble cut and other undesirable substances drawn into the syringe, can host bacterial 
growth --particularly in locales where cuts include lactose or other sugars. (79) These filters, if 
prepared with unwashed hands, or stored and re-used in "hard times", provide an additional 
infection source. (71) And tiny filter fibers may be injected along with the filtered drug 
contributing to the cut-related conditions. (66) The role of "needle sharing" in disease 
transmission is understood, but not all aspects of injecting have been equally well researched. 
Hence, the absence of consistent health education protocols for some injection preparation 
sequences. For example, research on the role assorted filter materials and heroin-dissolving 
acids may have on injectors' health is lacking, and existing recommendations are 
inconsistent. (80) 
<p>
Should venous collapse and scarring limit easily accessible injection sites, some IDUs 
terminate injecting. Others adapt by injecting under the tongue, in the temples, fingers, 
forehead, groin neck or other less conventional locations. Injecting in these sites requires a 
higher level of skill, and thinner or --in the case of groin shots, where the vein is often deep 
and not easily visible-- longer needles. Some professional hitters or house doctors specialize 
in these spots. (81) A report linking attempted jugular injection with spinal cord injury --the 
Brown-Sequard syndrome-- implicates heroin, quinine diluent, or both as causal agent(s), not 
needle manipulation per se. (82) Head and neck surgeons, reporting on the uncommon 
phenomenon of vocal chord paralysis following clumsy injections in the jugular vein, stated 
that common complications of this practice are cellulitis, abscess, venous thrombophlebitis 
and potentially, pulmonary embolism and pseudoaneurysm of carotid and subclavian 
arteries. (83) Additional complications --Horner's syndrome (nerve paralysis), and neck fibrosis-
- have been described by other reports. (84 85)
<p>
Malnutrition, sleep deprivation, poor personal hygiene, high stress levels, inadequate shelter, 
and poverty --characteristics many heavy drug users share-- have a negative impact on the 
immune system and frequently exacerbate all the previously described conditions. (86 87) In 
addition, the pain killing and cough suppressing properties of opiates work to mask 
symptoms of existing illness or injury. Minor respiratory infections, dental decay, and other 
common maladies may progress without notice or attention, until action is demanded by their 
severity. (88) Dissatisfaction with, or fear of, medical institutions has an additional negative 
effect on users' health. Fear of dentists and doctors is by no means experienced exclusively by 
drug users, but analgesics make it possible for them to postpone treatment longer than most 
non-users are generally able. This practice contributes to the loss of teeth and physical 
attractiveness, the development of serious complications necessitating more aggressive 
treatment, and the negative attitude of health care personnel. (89) "Addictophobia" is something 
all drugs users may be subjected to but, having more health risks and being more easily 
identified as illegal drug users, something to which (unskilled) injectors are particularly 
susceptible. It does not take much intuition to understand the role which being identified as a 
member of an, if not hated, at least not cherished minority, plays in presenting for treatment, 
or health status in itself.
<p>
<i>Sniffing</i>
<p>
Sniffing is the dominant mode of cocaine administration in western countries. (90) In NYC and 
other areas where heroin smoking is a relatively rare activity, sniffing is also a common mode 
of heroin administration, often preceeding injecting in a user's career. When a recent increase 
of NYC heroin sniffers was noticed, injection prevention/AIDS prevention interventions were 
designed and studied. (91) Anecdotal reports trace this rise in heroin sniffing to cocaine smokers 
trying to curb the negative side effects of their heavy cocaine use. (92) Given the results 
presented in chapters five and seven, this may well be a factor.
<p>
Even excluding the risk of viral infection, the potential physical harm of unskilled sniffing is 
much lower than that of unskilled injecting, but not entirely eliminated. As might be 
expected, physical problems attributed to sniffing typically involve the nose and sinuses. 
While no significant relationship has been demonstrated between cocaine sniffing and either 
lung disfunction or respiratory symptoms, (57) it has been associated with several other 
disorders, the most common of which is chronic sinusitis. Others include chronic rhinitis, 
perforation of the septum (93 27) and altered appearance of the nose (saddlenose). (94) However 
innocuous it sounds, cocaine sniffers' sinusitis has reportedly lead to botulism, optic 
neuropathy (95 96 97) and one reported case of Pott's Puffy Tumor; a potentially life-threatening 
bone marrow infection. (28)
<p>
Cocaine has both anesthetic and vasoconstricting properties. Besides a characteristic "high," 
when sniffed it numbs the nose and throat, and decreases blood flow through the nose and 
sinuses. Both these properties are implicated in the case of Pott's Puffy Tumor. Nasal tissue 
damage, caused by multiple insertions of a straw through which cocaine was sniffed went 
unnoticed, and decreased blood flow created conditions supportive to bacterial growth; 
bacteria which then spread via the veins draining the sinus. The risk of sinusitis and septal 
perforation is apparently increased by concomitant use of vasoconstricting nasal-inhalers, 
which may also decrease oxygen tension in the tissues and facilitate growth of anaerobic 
pathogens. (98) Like the high, the "freeze" which is part and parcel of the effects of intranasal 
cocaine, is subject to reversal once the dose has worn off. The high has a well-documented 
rebound depression (99) and the freeze, a rebound congestion making nasal decongestants 
understandably appealing. These decongestants are however, also subject to rebound 
reversals (98) --a nasty irony as they apparently aggravate the very condition which they are 
used to relive.
<p>
Literature describing the physical sequelae of heroin sniffing was hard to come by, but 
chronic granulomatous rhinitis is mentioned by one report. (13) Rhinitis, characterized by 
vasodilation of the nasal mucosa, nasal discharge and obstruction, is a symptom familiar to 
every sufferer of hayfever and colds. Allergic reactions to heroin have been well documented 
in overdose literature, and histamine reactions (itching, welts) are not unfamiliar to heroin 
injectors. It seems logical therefore, that similar reactions may occur when the drug is sniffed.
<p>
Rinsing the nostrils with water after use, and cautious, gentle insertion if a straw or tube is 
used, might prevent some of the harm caused when sniffing any drug. However the risk of 
introducing non-sterile irritating matter (and in the case of cocaine, one which diminishes 
blood flow) into the nose, throat and sinus remains.

<b>Communicable diseases</b>
<p>
There is no data available in the Netherlands comparing injecting and non-injecting drug use 
with respect to communicable diseases. Therefore it is hardly possible to relate drug 
administration rituals to the prevalence of communicable diseases. In RODIS a few indirect 
measures are available, wherein the same procedure as in section 10.2 is followed. Groups in 
which the prevalence of injecting drug use is low (the Surinamese/Antillian and the 
Moroccan group) are compared with the groups in which drug injection is far more prevalent 
(Dutch and foreign users). The lifetime prevalence of hepatitis in these groups, as reported by 
RODIS, is as follows: Dutch 25%, Foreigners 25%, Surinamese/Antillians 10% and 
Moroccans 11%. (19) This supports the rather obvious assumption that chasers are at less risk 
for contracting blood-borne diseases. Some caution however: when lifetime prevalence of 
gonorrhea (Dutch 24%, Foreigners 19%, Surinamese/Antillians 31% and Moroccans 16%) 
and syphilis (Dutch 6%, Foreigners 11%, Surinamese/Antillians 10% and Moroccans 2%) are 
considered, the Surinamese/Antillian scores are considerably higher, with gonorrhea in 
particular. This may be indicative of a higher frequency of (unsafe) sexual activity. Use of 
cocaine in this group is higher than average, (19) and several American studies have found links 
between cocaine use and HIV risk behavior. (100 101 102 103 104) This relationship, in a recent 
study in Amsterdam however, was not found. (105)
<p>
<a href="#hea">Top</a>
<p>
<a name="dis"></a>
<b>Discussion</b>
<p>
There is no clear evidence that, even after prolonged use, pure opiates in and of themselves 
cause physical damage. (106) But effects of drug combinations, diluents and administration 
techniques; "pre-morbid" status; and the sleep/wake cycles, source and frequency of nutrient-
intake, hygiene and housing quality, and other variables which have collectively become 
known as "lifestyle," create some distressing statistics. For example, "young opiate addicts" 
in one study had mortality rates an estimated sixteen times higher than age group norms. (107) 
Loss of fingers and toes to frostbite or infection is a common sight in some chillier or more 
ostracized IDU communities, and trackmarks are so solidly linked with needle use as to be 
used as proof of injecting --a requirement for getting supplied by many syringe exchange 
programs. (108 109 110) 
<p>
While certain syndromes are related to administration mode and technique, the drug effect 
itself is responsible for others. Constipation and resultant hemorrhoids or fecal impaction 
associated with heroin use occurs irrespective of administration route. (66 70) Opiates decrease 
circulation, respiration, cough reflex and body temperature. (88 48) Given the conditions of 
inadequate housing and harsh winters, these factors increase the risk of pneumonia, frostbite 
and hypothermia. Use of tobacco, and the circulatory damage resulting from this and other 
activities, most notably injecting, add an additional physical strain. (88) Heroin-induced 
histamine reactions are not infrequently local --rhinitis after sniffing, itchy welts around 
injection site, and bronchial distress after smoking. As evidenced by field work in Rotterdam 
and New York City, histamine reactions are unpredictable. The same sample of heroin, used 
by the same individual in the same manner, may produce a histamine response on one 
occasion, and not on another. Because allergic responses to heroin are presumed to be 
responsible for a significant number of "overdose" cases, this unpredictability is a troubling 
finding. The appetite suppressing action of stimulants, and to some degree opiates, contribute 
(in combination with financial status and lifestyle factors) toward malnutrition and 
emaciation. Many psychoactive drugs cause "cotton mouth," and food particles tend to collect 
between the teeth and (less engorged) dehydrated gums. This makes scrupulous oral hygiene -
-unfortunately far from commonplace-- a necessity if gum disease and tooth loss are to be 
avoided. Intoxicated female drug users may be troubled by inadequate vaginal lubrication, 
even during arousal. (111 90) Unless corrected with saliva or commercially available lubricant, 
this makes them more vulnerable to abrasion, infection and disease during penetrative sex. 
Stimulants are known to trigger yeast infections and herpes outbreaks in susceptible 
individuals, conditions which damage the integrity of skin and mucosa, and further increase 
vulnerability to (HIV and other sexually transmitted) infection during sexual activity. 
Furthermore, stimulants may cause sudden elevations of blood pressure (88) with symptoms 
ranging from spontaneous nosebleeds to coronary collapse.
<p>
As has been well documented elsewhere in the text, drug use is a social activity. Both the 
drugs consumed, and their consumption style, are influenced to a great extent by (sub)cultural 
norms. In this chapter, an attempt has been made to illustrate the physical risks inherent in the 
more popular modes of illegal drug administration, namely smoking and injecting. Sniffing, 
included because of its prevalence elsewhere, is fairly uncommon among most user groups in 
Rotterdam. Of the physical risks inherent in illegal drug use, the greatest is overdose. The 
possibility of overdose is significantly higher when injecting than smoking, for the simple 
reason that when smoking from foil or the typically utilized pipes the drug is administered 
gradually. The physical harm potential inherent to the different administration modes is a 
thornier issue. All drug use puts some strain on the organs filtering toxins from the body, the 
liver in particular. (48 70 88) Drug smoking affects the lungs and bronchial tubes. Many forms of 
skin, tissue and organ damage are the result of unsterile injections. The use of unsterile 
injecting equipment is also at the base of the spread of several serious communicable 
diseases, including HIV, whereas such a direct link is absent when drugs are smoked. But, 
when dose and purity are standardized, equipment sterile and sharp, and technique adequate, 
injecting may well be the less unhealthy alternative of the two. However, given the current 
conditions of drug prohibition, smoking seems less threatening to the health of drug users 
than injecting. 
<p>
"Almost all of the deleterious effects ordinarily attributed to the opiates, indeed, appear to be 
the effects of the narcotics laws instead." (88)
<p>
Without dismissing the importance of preventing and reducing the abuse of psychoactive 
substances in general, considering (illegal) drug use within the larger framework of social and 
public health is of main importance. In such an approach it becomes feasible to determine and 
weigh "primary" consequences of drug use (those related to the distinctive effects of the drug 
itself) and "secondary" consequences (those related to the conditions under which drugs are 
consumed). This distinction has been a major determinant of Dutch drug policy since the 
1970s. The importance of developing a drug policy in the context of a general health policy is 
becoming increasingly accepted, often spearheaded by the impact of the HIV epidemic 
among IDUs, (112 113 114 115) and has resulted in a rapidly growing international "harm reduction 
movement" among those involved in drug research, policy and practice. A major area of 
attention in this movement, is the development and evaluation of drug policy and practice 
which reduce both the primary and secondary harm of drug use. In this harm reduction 
framework, the aforementioned findings make an argument for stimulating policies which 
support the maintenance of non-injecting drug use patterns, such as chasing or sniffing and 
discourage injecting.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
Drug users are at risk for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other viral and 
microbiological infections. Although recently non injecting drug use related HIV has been 
reported (1 2 3 4), particularly injecting drug users (IDUs) are at risk, because of the use of 
contaminated injection equipment, generally termed needle sharing. (5 6) (Throughout the text, 
unless otherwise specified, the term needle sharing refers to the sharing of both needles and 
syringes.) On the basis of extensive research, needle sharing seems to be the most significant 
AIDS-related risk behavior practiced by IDUs. (5 6 7 8) Moreover, in the chain of transmission, 
the IDU seems also to be the main vector for secondary HIV spread to the heterosexual 
population in the U.S. (9 10)
<p>
In contrast with the United States and many neighboring countries, only a minority of drug 
users inject in the Netherlands. Most Dutch heroin users smoke their heroin and cocaine from 
tinfoil (chinesing or chasing the dragon). The availability, purity, and price of these drugs on 
the Dutch illegal market have stabilized over the years at relatively high levels and moderate 
prices, compared with neighboring countries and the United States. These economic factors 
were prerequisites for the diffusion (11) of the Asian practice of heroin smoking into the Dutch 
heroin using population. Mainly because of these economic factors, many Dutch users do not 
feel the necessity to inject, as do most of their foreign counterparts. (12 13 14) However, the IDU 
minority have not been overlooked. Since the mid 1970s harm reduction strategies for all 
drug users were adopted by Dutch governmental (15) and helping organizations. (16) Around 1985 
AIDS became a major item of concern in the Netherlands. In 1984 Amsterdam started its 
needle exchange system. The number of needles that were distributed grew rapidly from 
25.000 in 1984 to 820.000 in 1989. (17) Rotterdam started its municipal needle exchange system 
in the first half of 1987. The total number of needles distributed is considerably lower than in 
Amsterdam, respectively 196700 in 1988, 251700 in 1989, 223200 in 1990 and 231300 in 
1991. (18)
<p>
Few HIV seroprevalence studies have been conducted in the Netherlands. In a selected group 
that may not represent all drug users in Amsterdam, van den Hoek et al. found a 
seroprevalence of 33 percent at entry into the study. (19) A study outside the large urban centers 
indicates a seropositivity of 4.8 percent in a non-representative sample. (20) In a Rotterdam 
study of a sample of extreme problematic drug users in methadone maintenance seropositivity 
was found to be 9.7 percent in 1986 and 6.5 percent in 1987. (16) Unpublished results from a 
1988 study of an intake cohort of a drug treatment introduction program in the Hague show a 
seroprevalence of 0%. (21) As a comparison, self-reported lifetime prevalence of hepatitis 
among methadone clients in Rotterdam is 21 percent, for gonorrhea 24 percent and for 
syphilis 7 percent. (22)
<p>
HIV is undoubtedly transmitted through needle practices. Nonetheless, especially in 
situations where clean syringes are readily available it is not merely the act of sharing needles 
that constitutes the risks of spreading the virus. The behaviors associated with needle sharing 
can be decomposed into different components that each have their own distinctive probability 
of risk. The hypothesis of this chapter is that a deeper look into drug use contexts reveals 
other forms of sharing behavior that may be important factors in the transmission of HIV. A 
look beyond needle sharing involves a look into a world of multiple sharing and care taking 
practices that constitute the bonds of relationships of IDUs' social networks. These 
relationships are multidimensional and may lead to relationships with non-IDUs. For analytic 
purposes three patterns of sharing behavior directly related to HIV-transmission risks can be 
distinguished: 1) sharing, (including lending and passing on) syringes or needles; 2) sharing 
of other drug injection paraphernalia; 3) drug sharing. Specifically, certain forms of drug 
sharing may provide additional routes by which contaminated needles can present risks of 
infection to IDUs. In this chapter, a look beyond needle sharing is presented and one such 
drug sharing practice - frontloading - is described.

<b>Sharing Drugs</b>
<p>
Chapter nine demonstrated that the use of heroin and cocaine among the research participants 
is embedded in a social structure that facilitates the use of these drugs. In addition, this social 
structure also functions as a social support system for the users. It was shown that valuable 
items, such as housing, food and clothing are shared on a regular basis in friendship and 
acquaintance networks. Users were observed to frequently help each other with daily 
problems associated with a lifestyle in which the use of drugs is the most important (and thus 
overwhelmingly demanding) value. Furthermore, in this social structure they socialize and 
find moral support. 
<p>
In this context of social support in drug user networks the sharing of drugs is an important 
and frequent phenomenon. Quantitative analysis of the observations of drug self-
administration rituals clearly shows that drug use rarely is an individual act. The most 
common places where drugs were ingested are the dealing place (56%), home (18%), and a 
friends home (14%) (see figure 9.1 in chapter nine). Likewise, 43 of 62 observed drug sales at 
house addresses were followed by direct ingestion of (at least a part of) the purchased drugs. 
The mean number of people present at these places during the observed drug taking event was 
4.3. As the vast majority of drugs is consumed at other places then home and with other 
people around, it was not surprising that drugs were shared in 50% (N = 93) of observed 
events (see figure 11.1). Chapter nine discussed the instrumental and social (i.e. social) 
functions of drug sharing, that are largely equal for smoking and injecting drug users. The 
proceeding sections will focus on the techniques commonly used when IDUs share drugs.
<p>

<b>Frontloading and Backloading</b>
<p>
In 81% of observed sharing events among IDUs (N = 26), the drugs were shared by 
frontloading or streepjes delen (sharing stripes; referring to the scale gradients on the barrel of 
the syringe). This practice involves a special technique using two syringes (see figure 11.2). 
When sharing by frontloading, the drug is prepared on one spoon and then drawn in one 
syringe (A). From the second syringe (B) the needle is removed and the plunger is drawn 
back and by spouting a part of the solution from syringe A through the hub of syringe B, the 
drugs are divided. In this way the drugs can be divided into two or more equal parts (see 
photo sequence). 
<p>
The following fieldnote documents a representative situation in which drugs are shared by 
frontloading. Richard and Chris have bought drugs at a dealing place and have gone home to 
inject:
<p>
<blockquote>Back home Richard and Chris start preparations to shoot up a 'cocktail' (a mixture 
of cocaine and heroin, also called a speedball). Chris and Richard both get tools and put them on 
the table. They sit down at the same time. Richard puts the spoon in front of him and takes out 
the packages. He opens the heroin package, holds it above the spoon and empties it. He adds 
some lemon and water. Meanwhile Chris opens two injection swabs and puts them on the broad 
rim (edge) of the ash-tray. When Richard is ready putting things into the spoon he nods, which 
Chris understands as a sign to put the swabs on fire with his lighter. This produces a flame +4 
cm high, above which Richard now holds the spoon to boil the contents. Chris looks 
interestingly into the spoon and says: "I hope it's enough that we feel it." It takes something 
more then 2 minutes to dissolve the heroin. After this Richard puts in the cocaine almost 
immediately, without waiting for the solution to cool off. Cotton is used to make a filter, and 
Richard draws the cocktail in the syringe without the needle. Richard also divides the cocktail. 
He puts the needle back on his syringe. Chris gives him his syringe after removing the needle. 
Richard inserts his needle in Chris' syringe and pushes the piston. Before doing so he looks how 
much cocktail is in his syringe, so he knows how much to put over. He then holds the 2 syringes 
side by side to compare the contents. In one of them is a little more. That one he gives to Chris. 
</blockquote>
<p>
Except when the spoon is well cleaned and both the syringes are new or effectively cleaned 
(e.g. by bleaching) there is an increased risk of passing microbiological or viral infections, 
when utilizing this technique. The most obvious direction of transmission is from A to B as in 
syringe A present blood rests are diluted in the drug solution. However when inserting A into 
B, the needle of A can get into contact with virus particles (e.g. in old blood) in the hub of 
syringe B. This practice is only one of the many possible ways to utilize syringes in sharing 
drugs. Spouting from the donor syringe into the recipient syringe was most often observed, 
but it is, of course, also possible to draw the liquid from the donor syringe. This can be 
termed reversed frontloading. In order to frontload, the needle of at least one of the syringes 
involved in the drug sharing event must be removable (so that a needle can be inserted). 
<p>
Where syringes with fixed needles (mostly 1 ml insulin) are the standard a similar technique 
has evolved, called backloading. This procedure was demonstrated by a female IDU from 
London: 
<p>
<blockquote>The drug solution is one of the insulin syringes. She pulls the plunger out of the 
other syringe and holds the barrel almost horizontal. Slowly she spouts half of the solution in 
the back opening. "You need to do it very precisely. It must not go in all the way. There needs 
to stay some air between the liquid and the needle, otherwise you fuck up." Just as she explains, 
the liquid accumulates  1 cm from the back of the needle. She puts down the donor syringe, 
picks up the plunger and carefully holds it against the opening. In one smooth movement she 
pushes the plunger a little into the barrel, while simultaneously turning the needle upwards. 
"This is the crucial move", she explains, "I've seen several people blow shots doing it --squirting 
the shot into the air. Mostly when they were sick --shaking hands, you know."</blockquote>
<p>
From this demonstration it can be assessed that backloading requires a considerably more 
skilled hand than frontloading. Sometimes a certain quantity of drug solution is prepared in 
advance and stored in a syringe. This solution is then consumed in several shots over a given 
period of time --either alone or shared with other users.

<b>Social Implications of Drug Sharing</b>
<p>
Drugs are shared for an intertwined complex of social and economic reasons. In the observed 
sharing events 68% involved social incentives and in 83% economic. Many events fit into 
both economic and social categories. As illustrated in the last fieldnote, heroin users 
frequently share the drugs they buy together. At house addresses one pays less if purchasing 
in quantity. Therefore, it is rational to pool money and jointly buy drugs. Thus sharing results 
in more drugs for the individual for the same amount of money. Likewise, dealer/users may 
give a betermakertje or mazzeltje to someone without money for the sake of customers 
relations. But this kind of credit is not evenly distributed to all customers. Nor is it over time. 
Dealers must take several factors into account. They must control their financial balance and 
anticipate their clients' financial position, but they must also remain on good terms with their 
friends. They do not want to acquire the image of being in it just for the money and become 
alienated from their personal network. Helping with a betermakertje is a customary 
motivation for drug sharing, not limited to dealers. The term helping is common vocabulary 
and refers to the revered communal rule of helping a fellow user who is in withdrawal (see 
chapter nine). 
<p>
A frequent sharing situation highly resembles that of being among friends in a pub. The users 
sit around a table, talk in a sociable atmosphere and share the available drugs. Mostly this 
concerns smokers, as IDUs spend less time at house addresses. Participation in shared drug 
taking activities (e.g. buying and using at the same house addresses) results over time in more 
structural relationships among individuals. By sharing drugs users make new contacts and 
existing ones are reinforced. Indeed, drug use is not the only factor that brings and keeps drug 
users together. They engage in many common activities and they spend considerable time on 
social and other conventional activities. (23 24) Moreover, the relations of the observed drug 
users were often much more intense and multiplex. Drugs were often shared among sexual 
partners, family, or people sharing living arrangements. A significant percentage (23%) of the 
IDUs observed to share drugs were typical running mates or dyads. The acquisition and use 
of drugs is an essential binding element in these dyadic relationships. (25 26) The following 
fieldnote provides an illustration. 
<p>
<blockquote>Meanwhile they are telling how they came together, live together, etc. They're 
together for +5 weeks now. Chris: "We share everything; social benefit, food, dope, etc." 
Richard: "For instant tomorrow Chris gets his benefit and I get dope for it. Friday I'll get my 
money and we use that to buy dope." He goes on: "We go together into town every day, first to 
get methadone and then to make money."</blockquote>
<p>
The bond between running partners is believed to be "the strongest positive relationship 
within the IV-drug use subculture" and a "substitute for family". (27) 
<p>
Drug sharing as described in this chapter is based on a study of a Dutch population; that is, in 
a situation of relatively low criminalization of drug use and relatively high availability of 
both drugs and syringes. However, drug sharing is embedded in a much broader pattern of 
social behaviors of heroin users, which includes the sharing of many necessaries of life. 
Although the frequency of these sharing behaviors could be influenced by the Dutch 
normalization policy, (28 29) enabling drug users to reflect the social responsibility, characteristic 
for Dutch society, (30) in essence they are almost universal in drug subcultures and have been 
documented in many studies in different times and places. (25 31 32) Sharing fits the broader 
context of drug user's lives and finds its function in coping with craving, human contact and 
needs, and life on the margins of society. As Mata and Jorquez put it: 
<p>
<blockquote>Efforts to curb injecting drug use and needle sharing must begin with the 
understanding that these practices are embedded and maintained by a set of ongoing personal 
relations and exchanges in injecting drug users' personal social networks. Needle sharing must 
be seen as part of the larger picture of drug sharing practices. Drug sharing is at once a means to 
socialize, to belong, and to provide some measure of protection from the exigencies of la vida 
loca. More immediately, it is a means to cope with one's craving for drugs (31). </blockquote>
<p>
Both the helping and sharing (as well as the ripping and violence) characteristic of the 
subcultures of heavy drug users, are normal behaviors under abnormal or extreme 
circumstances. They can be compared with similar behaviors in high stress situations, such as 
in war and concentration camps. (33 34) Without a little help from your friends it is impossible to 
survive in the tough parallel world of users, dealers and police. In this context, sharing 
balances the constraints, the ripping and running (35), the competition, violence and mistrust of 
daily life. Then, drug sharing is an integrating ritual sanctioning a common lifestyle and 
strengthening mutual ties. (36)

<b>Virological and Epidemiological Implications of Drug Sharing</b>
<p>
The presented data suggest that the drug sharing technique of frontloading can be an 
alternative route of viral transmission. An important issue, regarding HIV transmission is the 
survival of HIV in blood rests in a syringe. It has been demonstrated that the virus can be 
detected up to 30 days (37) and even in syringes without visible remnants of blood. (38) The 
presumed infectivity of Western Blot-positive blood (39) supports the notion that positive tested 
syringes are potentially infectious when used by other IDUs. Moreover, the interval of 30 
days must be regarded as an extremely long period between use and re-use of syringes of 
IDUs. It is much more plausible that a syringe is used several times a day, especially when 
cocaine is involved, or when employed at shooting galleries. In this research it was found that 
when IDUs shared drugs by frontloading, the interval between two shared doses was 
sometimes even less than half an hour. Furthermore, the upsurge of injecting cocaine use may 
have additional consequences. Recent findings indicate that cocaine can exacerbate HIV-1 
transmission and infection in drug users. (40) 
<p>
First publication of the findings on frontloading, prompted two American studies into the 
frequency of frontloading and its association with HIV infection. Among a sample of IDUs in 
Baltimore, Samuels et al. found no significant association. (41) However, the most recent 
findings come from New York and support the hypothesized infectivity of frontloading. 
Frontloading was widespread in this study. During the two years before the interview almost 
40% (80/207) of subjects frontloaded, as did 30% (63/210) during the past 30 days. A strong 
association with HIV infection was reported. HIV seroprevalence was 71% among IDUs who 
frontloaded during the last two years and 36% among those who did not. (42)
<p>
The technique of frontloading and similar techniques are known far beyond the research sites 
of this study. This hypothesis is supported by the data and other research. Sharing drugs is a 
common phenomenon. An evaluation of a needle exchange program in a small Dutch town 
showed that 67% of the exchangers were preparing collective doses. (43) The observations of 
frontloading in this research were recorded in different friendship groups and networks. In 
addition, a considerable number of the IDUs in this study have at times kept residence in 
other Dutch or foreign cities. Some have their roots in other cities, others come from 
neighboring countries. Another obvious ground for sharing drugs by frontloading is that it is 
the most efficient and honest way to split a certain amount of drugs in two or more portions. 
When dividing the powdered drugs it is very difficult to cut them into equal amounts without 
a scale of some sort. By frontloading the solution can rather simply be proportionated because 
most syringes have scale gradients on them. This is a powerful incentive when dealing with 
goods that on a street level outweigh the price of gold 4 to 20 times. Furthermore, 
experienced IDUs are highly familiar with the instrument that is indispensable for their 
preferred route of getting high. In that respect, they are certainly the experts. When 
questioned on frontloading, a London female IDU colorfully explained while demonstrating 
backloading with two 1 ml insulin syringes: 
<p>
<blockquote>"Yeah, I know what you mean. But because most users use these 'fits' (she points 
at the insulin syringes, which have fixed needles), we do it like this. [demonstrates backloading] 
... Hey, we live with this thing --go to bed with it and get up with it. We know it inside out. 
Played with it, did everything what you can think of. Makes splitting gear (heroin) easy and fast, 
get it? Everybody knows that."</blockquote>
<p>
Indeed, around the world IDUs know what is and is not possible with syringes and needles 
and what serves their needs best. For the purpose of a fair share, frontloading and backloading 
apparently qualify everywhere. In Warsaw, Poland --where syringes are extremely scarce-- 
frontloading was observed at a dealer's house. This dealer had two sets. One he used himself. 
The other syringe had a double function. The dealer sold self-produced compote. In 
transactions the second syringe was used to measure and transfer the requested quantity in the 
client's syringe. It was, however, also lent to clients, who did not possess their own set. (44) 
Frontloading has been observed in drug sharing events in the Bronx (New York City) and Los 
Angeles (45), and reported in Baltimore. (41) In South Florida it is used in a procedure to prepare 
speedball, (46) It seems also common practice in Barcelona, Spain (47) and in several Swiss cities, 
such as Basel, Bern and Zrich. (48) Backloading has been documented in New York, (42) San 
Francisco (49) and Denver (50) in the USA, in London, Great Britain (51) and in Barcelona, Spain. (47)

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
The AIDS epidemic among IDUs highlights the importance of basic knowledge of lifestyles, 
behaviors and interactions of drug users in their social networks. The thesis of this chapter 
has been that a deeper look into this natural territory may reveal unknown and, for HIV 
prevention important matters. One such matter, the practice of frontloading has been 
presented. Research results on its infectivity are starting to become available. The negative 
results from Baltimore may well be related to methodological problems, as the New York 
study shows a very strong association. In addition to needle sharing, frontloading can be an 
important factor in the spread of HIV among IDUs. Until recently, this has been overlooked 
by most researchers as well as by IDUs who may otherwise avoid needle sharing and/or other 
risk practices. In the Netherlands, where there actually is a high availability of sterile syringes 
and where the actual sharing of needles and syringes has decreased significantly, (52 53) 
frontloading could even become a main route of HIV-spread. Thus, needle sharing is a 
definitionally incomplete notion. The term is a rough simplification of a very complex reality. 
Interactions of patterns, situations and socio-cultural factors involved in illegal drug use 
contribute considerably to the spread of HIV. Further research efforts into drug sharing 
practices and related issues should enhance scientific appreciation of these socio-cultural 
factors. On the other hand, prevention efforts aimed at filling such gaps in drug users' 
knowledge of HIV-risks need to be given urgent attention. In the Netherlands, the described 
findings have been implemented in printed prevention materials for IDUs, that are distributed 
by drug treatment agencies. (54) As only a minority of drug users at any given time are in daily 
contact with treatment and helping agencies, the methods used to disseminate this knowledge 
should involve a permanent street education process of active IDUs and equipping them with 
the necessary tools to change their behavior in the desired direction.

<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
Most of the current behavioral acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) research consists 
of studies relating HIV prevalence to the prevalence of HIV-risk factors, such as needle 
sharing. Few published studies describe what actually happens in such needle sharing events. 
Given this gap in the literature, there is an obvious need for ethnographic studies that provide 
thick description of the patterns and circumstances of drug use and locate hitherto unmeasured 
variables associated with risk behaviors such as needle sharing. In the previous chapter it 
became clear that the notion of needle sharing only partly describes and therefore obscures the 
intricate interactions of which this specific, but dangerous, act is an element. Sharing behaviors 
have been found to be frequent and significant events for the drug users observed in this study. 
The sharing of valued items such as housing, food and clothing is an everyday occurrence tied 
to the needs of survival in extreme circumstances. The sharing of drugs, observed among both 
injecting drug users (IDUs) and non-IDUs, fits into this wider pattern of daily interaction and 
exchange. In this chapter a further analysis of unsafe injecting drug use situations is presented. 
The chapter will discuss the factors involved in the cases of needle sharing observed in this 
research. It will also address the sharing of other drug injection paraphernalia --a frequently 
observed activity.

<a name="fact"></a>
<b>Factors Underlying Needle Sharing</b>
<p>
In 68 percent of the observed self-injection events, a new syringe was used. In 23 percent 
IDUs reused their own syringe. In less than 10 percent of the self-injections, a potentially 
unsafe syringe was reused (table 12.1). The used syringes found, or received from others, 
were not adequately cleaned (e.g. water only). (1 2) The unsafe self-injections were recorded at 
addresses where injecting was permitted and in a public place. Because of the normal address 
rules against injecting, IDUs used their drugs in private settings more often than smokers. 
These house rules may prevent needle sharing. However, some IDUs let their friends and 
acquaintances inject at their place, sometimes in return for a taste of the drug. At some of 
these using places and at some of the house addresses that allow people to inject, clean 
syringes supplied by an outreach and needle exchange program were dispensed (see chapter 
14). 70% of the new syringes used were of such origin. Thus, instead of sharing used syringes, 
IDUs shared new syringes, thereby giving the responsibility for safe injecting a collective 
quality, building on structural, normatively regulated interaction patterns --a very important 
implication for HIV prevention. 
<p>
Table 12.1
<p>
Although both collective and individual norms of responsibility have been found to operate to 
minimize and manage the risks of needle sharing, there were a few situations in which unsafe 
needle behaviors were observed. The following fieldnote, for example, was recorded on the 
first floor of a squatted house. The house had three floors of which the first and third were in 
use. It did not have running water; water was carried to the house in containers from a garage 
next door. The house was inhabited by a group of older IDUs. At times the group offered 
shelter to other drug users. They also enabled other drug users to deal heroin, cocaine, or 
amphetamine in exchange for money and/or drugs. Occasionally they themselves dealt drugs 
as was the case at the time of observation. This house also was supplied with sterile syringes 
by the outreach program, mentioned above. However, at the time of observation it was 
unclear whether there were any new syringes left. Jack (the doorman) just opened the door for 
Billy and Dirk. They all knew one another. During the observation some other users went in 
and out. 
<p>
<blockquote>Billy asks Dirk what he wants. "Let's do coke first and then a cocktail", Dirk 
replies. Billy has a syringe wrapped in aluminum foil. He does not want to wait for a new 
syringe. Dirk does not have one with him and starts searching. He asks Jack if there are any 
new ones left. "I don't know", Jack replies, "Maybe upstairs. Ask Karel, he's there." They call 
Karel several times but he does not answer. Then Dirk finds a syringe on a cupboard. It is 
unclear who it belongs to. He rinses it with water. He pulls up water twice from a cup he has 
filled from the water container and squeezes it through the needle. Billy mumbles something 
about AIDS. Dirk says "Ik heb schijt aan AIDS." (I don't give a shit about AIDS). 
</blockquote>
<p>
Dirk used this syringe two times. First he shared a dose of cocaine with Billy and within 30 
minutes he shared a cocktail with Billy and Jack. both times these drugs were shared by 
frontloading. 
<p>
In the second fieldnote, two IDUs (Eric and Anja) were in the shooting room of a house 
address where injecting is allowed. Leo entered the room. Leo did not come to the address to 
buy drugs, but to look for Eric. Eric owed him money and he had heard that Eric was at the 
address. 
<p>
<blockquote>"I wanted to ask you if you can pay back or otherwise if you could help me with 
a shot." Leo said. Eric was not able to pay Leo back but offered a cocktail. Leo gladly 
accepted. "Great man, you don't know how wonderful that is, I'm so glad I didn't miss you 
here." However Leo was not in possession of a syringe. Leo asks Eric for a syringe: "I 
couldn't get a new one. The needle exchange at the Central Station had closed already". Eric 
tells Leo he only has his own, which he is not willing to share. Then Leo asks Anja if he can 
take one of her used syringes that are laying in front of her. Anja: "That's useless, they're all 
blunt, but if you want to try that's okay with me." She picks up several syringes from the floor 
and looks closely at the needle, comparing one with the other. Finally she makes her decision 
which one to give to Leo and gives it saying: "You have to clean it well." Leo goes with the 
syringe towards the sink and cleans it seven or eight times with cold water. To clean the 
plastic part of the needle, he moves it in such a way that there is some space between syringe 
and needle. He presses the plunger strongly so the plastic is cleaned under pressure. The water 
now does not come through the needle but shoots away through the little space between 
syringe and the plastic needle holder. Leo states: "It must be clean now". Anja tells him: 
"Don't worry I'm checked for AIDS recently, I told Eric too". </blockquote>
<p>
In the following fieldnote, Mohammed and Abdul had obtained new syringes from the 
exchange program near the Central Railroad Station before they went to a house address to 
buy cocaine and heroin. Not allowed to inject at the address, they went to a small greenhouse 
in a park. Mohammed prepared the jointly bought drugs. He then divided them by 
frontloading. Abdul wanted to check if the solution was equally divided between both 
syringes. 
<p>
<blockquote>Mohammed gives both syringes to Abdul and asks him: "Don't you trust me?" 
Abdul doesn't answer. He holds the syringes next to each other and stares at them. While 
doing this he accidentally drops a syringe. The needle falls straight onto the ground. Abdul 
curses and so does Mohammed. Mohammed says: "Now you see what happens, why don't you 
believe me?". Abdul picks up the syringe and looks closely at the needle. He asks Mohammed 
if he still can use it. Mohammed takes the syringe and runs the needle tip over his thumbnail. 
"No", he says, "there is a burr on it. It's not sharp any more and it's dirty. You've got to get a 
new one". Abdul: "No, I don't go back, give me yours". Mohammed: "Then you have to wait 
until I'm ready". After Mohammed has taken his shot he starts cleaning his syringe with the 
water from the bottle. He puts some lemon juice in the cooker again, pulls it into his syringe 
and shakes it so that it mixes with the water. He puts the needle back on it, holds it with two 
fingers, and presses the water/lemon solution through it as hard as possible. Mohammed 
explains: "the lemon bites and cleans the needle better". When he's ready, he puts the needle 
on Abdul's syringe. </blockquote>
<p>
The examination of these three fieldnotes indicates that needle sharing often is the result of 
complex and multiple factors. It is important to ascertain that in all of the fieldnotes, needle 
sharing took place as an element of a drug sharing sequence. In none of the fieldnotes, the use 
of another's syringe was, however, planned. Rather an unexpected situation occurred. In the 
first fieldnote, Billy and Dirk select the particular address because injection is allowed and new 
syringes are available. However, at the time of entering new syringes were not available. In the 
second fieldnote, Leo did not have the money to buy drugs but, by coincidence, learned that 
Eric, who owed him money, was at the address. He did not have a syringe as he had been too 
late at the needle exchange. In the last fieldnote, although sufficient prevention measures were 
taken in advance, an unfortunate accident puts one of the users at risk.
<p>
In all three situations an unanticipated change puts the IDUs in the uncomfortable position of 
choosing between postponing/abstaining from a shot and an unsafe injection. They all chose 
for the unsafe injection although they were well aware of the potential risks of their behavior 
as evidenced by their rather intensive efforts to clean the used syringes. In the first two 
fieldnotes, AIDS is associatively mentioned while cleaning the syringes while in the last 
fieldnote the use of lemon is presented as a cleaning method superior to using water only. 
However, the existence of AIDS-related knowledge as an effective protecting factor can be 
seen as dependent on certain specific situational factors. 
<p>
The significance of one of these situational factors, the intensity of drug craving, deserves 
special attention. Shortly before an injection, IDUs can often be observed to become highly 
aroused. This arousal leads to preoccupation with the sequence that relieves withdrawal or 
craving. (3) For some IDUs, this sequence begins when the drugs are obtained. For others, the 
preparation of the injection is the starting point. As one IDU put it: "As soon as I put it on the 
spoon my stomach turns around and I know it's gonna happen, I'm gonna feel that intense 
rush". In all of the presented cases, postponing the injection would have caused noticeable 
stress. In the first fieldnote, Billy and Dirk were in high anticipation of an injection. They had 
already visited the address 30 minutes earlier, expecting to find a dealer working. However, 
the dealer had just left, so they went to another to buy. When they returned Billy complained 
that it had taken them considerable trouble to find a dealer. Dirk did not bother to see if there 
were any new syringes upstairs. By this time, the drug craving had become too intense for 
further deferral. Leo (second fieldnote) explicitly expressed relief when he was offered an 
injection. In the last fieldnote, the accident happened only seconds before actual injecting. 
Obviously, the craving of Abdul has become so intense that he ignores Mohammed's advice to 
obtain another syringe. Furthermore, in all cases cocaine or a mixture of cocaine and heroin 
was injected. The addition of cocaine to the daily drug-using rituals has been observed in the 
field to be associated with an intensification of craving and a disruption of stabilized heroin-
methadone patterns. 
<p>
While situational factors play the most important role in needle sharing, certain personal 
factors can also be seen. One such factor is that of socially learned experience with the 
injecting ritual, internalized during the IDU career. This experience includes, among other 
things, protective skills that support safe needle use. The interaction between Billy and Dirk 
provides an illustration of this factor. To inject, Billy, an experienced IDU, went to a place 
where normally clean syringes are available. Nevertheless, he carried his own used syringe 
anticipating the absence of new ones. In contrast, Dirk, a novice IDU with no visible needle 
marks, did not bring a syringe. Immediately after injecting cocaine, he began smoking heroin. 
He identified himself, not as injector, but as a smoker, stating: "I'm only shooting now and 
then, strictly speaking I am a chineser" (chaser). Irrespective of his AIDS knowledge, Dirk's 
particular self-deception works against taking the appropriate precautions. His self-perception 
as a chaser provides a false sense of security that, in turn, leads to blase attitudes such as "I 
don't give a shit about AIDS". In the last fieldnote, another case of inadequate socialization is 
found. Both users were still at an early point in their injecting careers. Mohammed, who 
reported he had been injecting for about half a year, is instructing the even less experienced 
Abdul who was about to take his 10th lifetime injection.

<b>The Sharing of other Drug Injecting Paraphernalia</b>
<p>
Even in injecting drug use situations where needle sharing does not occur, there may be hidden 
risks that are the result of related practices. Drug users often share other paraphernalia, such 
as knives, lighters, spoons, water cups, ties and filters and chemicals, such as stomach salt 
(baking soda or bicarbonate) or ammonia (both used in preparing crack-cocaine) and 
acidifiers, such as lemon juice or ascorbic (to dissolve the heroin). These tools and materials 
are all used in the process of preparing the drug for consumption and some of these are 
supplied at house addresses. 
<p>
In general, there is no exchange of body fluids involved in the sharing of chasing 
paraphernalia, but sharing chasing tubes may transmit minimal quantities of saliva resulting in 
the spread of, for example, bacteria and viruses that cause mouth sores, colds, influenza and 
maybe even hepatitis. Thus these practices normally include no risks of HIV transmission. 
IDUs' sharing of knives, lighters and tourniquets is also without risks. The sharing of citric and 
other acids probably presents no risks, because of the aggressive properties of these agents. 
Infection may result from sharing water containers, spoons and filters. 
<p>
Water is an important ingredient for IDUs --it is necessary to dissolve the powder drugs. 
When available IDUs will generally take water from a tap. However, when the injection is 
taken at a place without running water (e.g. a squat) often the water is stored in cups, bottles 
or a jerrican: 
<p>
<blockquote>Frits went to a jerrican with water and with the syringe (without the needle) he 
pulled out some water. He then poured a bit on the spoon. </blockquote>
<p>
Cleaning a syringe with water from a container for common use may contaminate this 
container. Virological studies have demonstrated that HIV can survive in tap water for an 
extended interval. (1) In tap water at room temperature, the virus can survive for over one 
week. (4) Consequently, using water from a jointly used container to prepare an injection may be 
a means of viral transfer. It can contaminate every item that is part of the user's injecting set, 
even when these are new or cleaned beforehand. (5) 
<p>
Two factors are of importance in regards to the transmission of HIV via water. First, there is 
the drug injected. Injecting cocaine or amphetamine alone may carry more risk than an 
injection of heroin or a cocktail of heroin and cocaine or amphetamine, as these drugs are 
generally dissolved without heating (cold shake). When heroin is involved the solution must be 
heated which may kill the virus. This is, however, dependent on both the temperature and the 
time of heating. (6) Moreover, due to the chemical form (a base) of the heroin, marketed in the 
Netherlands, users use an acidifier to dissolve the heroin in water. This acid may also impact 
on the potency of the virus. A recent Scottish study found that the usual vinegar solutions 
used by Glaswegian IDUs to prepare heroin for injection inactivated both cell-free and cell-
associated HIV. (7) 
<p>
The second important point is the quantity of HIV positive blood in the water container. The 
probability of infection presumably depends on the quantity of virus exchanged. Recent 
simulations of needle sharing have found the volume of transferred blood from index user to 
first sharer to range from 0.51 ml to 28.36 ml, depending on syringe size, booting and rinsing. (8) 
In another study the mean volume recovered in needle sharing simulations was 34 ml. (9) These 
volumes are, however, more dependent on the type of syringe than on the barrel size, whereby 
1 ml insulin syringes with fixed needles hold considerably less residue than syringes with 
detachable needles. (10) Information specifying the concentration of HIV in blood and the 
likelihood of infection in vivo is unavailable, (8) but a relationship between the amount of virus 
and the chance of infection has been suggested. (11) As the concentration of blood and 
consequently the volume of HIV in water containers is in general significantly lower than in 
used syringes, the chance from infection by sharing water is probably lower than when sharing 
or frontloading with unclean syringes, although the minimum quantity of HIV capable of 
infection is unknown. Therefore, the availability of water, the size of the container, the 
frequency of use and the number of users may be all of influence. In abandoned buildings 
without running water, Koester et al. observed containers with water that had turned pink 
from blood. (5) In this research, such extreme situations were not observed. 
<p>
Spoons are often readily available on dealing / use addresses and used by both smokers (to 
prepare base-cocaine) and IDUs. Spoon sharing is probably the most common form of 
paraphernalia sharing. But in none of the observations of the sharing of spoons (or other drug 
paraphernalia) could a ritual interaction pattern be detected. Spoons are shared in the same 
manner as coffee users may lend or borrow a spoon. To illustrate a more or less typical 
situation of spoon sharing the following excerpt from a fieldnote is presented:
<p>
<blockquote>John starts to prepare a shot of heroin. He takes a spoon from a cup which 
contains several and throws the content of the paper in the spoon. [...] In the meantime Cor 
has entered the place. He has a quarter of cocaine and uses the same spoon as John did to 
prepare an injection. </blockquote>
<p>
Most IDUs use filters when drawing the solution into the syringe prior to injecting. The main 
purpose of this step is to screen out undissolved particles that may clog the needle. (5) This is a 
universal practice, as even when the powder is totally dissolved, one uses a filter. Wadding 
and cigarette filters are most commonly used. A piece of tissue can also be used. When these 
are not available the user will often take some lint from her/is clothing. It is not unusual to 
leave the filter in the spoon for the next injection:
<p>
<blockquote>Jack puts the coke in a tea spoon which he takes out of the open low cupboard 
he is preparing his shot on. In the spoon already is wadding filter. He gets a cup of water from 
the tap, pulls up some water with his syringe and squirts some in the spoon. </blockquote>
<p>
One reason for saving the filter in the spoon is that a residue of the drug remains on the spoon 
and in the filter:
<p>
<blockquote>Bert has just used Patrick's spoon to prepare a shot. Patrick then wanted his 
spoon back. "Here it is", Bert said, "look there is still some dope on it", as if it was a gift. 
</blockquote>
<p>
Some IDUs save the filters and inject the extract in bad times when they run out of drugs and 
money. Injecting the extract may lead to a, by many users feared, syndrome, characterized by 
symptoms, such as sudden chills and trembling over the entire body, muscle aches, headache, 
nausea and fever, believed to result from an acute reaction to a bacterial infection. (12) Because 
of the manifest trembling, this syndrome is known under the local argot term the shakes. When 
a fellow user in need of a dose is granted such savings, this syndrome seems probably the 
smallest risk. The practice of reusing and sharing filters is yet another opportunity for HIV 
transmission, as blood rests may easily remain in the fabric of the filter. Even when the liquid 
vaporizes and the presumed blood and virus in the filter (or in the spoon or other injecting 
paraphernalia) dry, these remain infective. (2)
<p>
A possible facilitating factor of paraphernalia sharing and contamination with HIV or other 
blood-borne infections is related to the physical condition of the veins of IDUs. A considerable 
number of IDUs suffer from collapsed veins resulting in great difficulties with injecting, as is 
witnessed in the next fieldnote:
<p>
<blockquote>When shooting up Harrie uses a hemp rope to tie his arm. He is having problems 
finding a vein. He tries several spots on his left arm but he does not succeed. Then he tries his 
other arm, also without success. He is already bleeding from several spots. He sits on the floor 
rolls up his pants and tries his left leg and the other. Finally he succeeds. He washes the blood 
from his arms and legs with a rag and some water. With the same rag he sweeps the blood he 
dripped on the floor away. </blockquote>
<p>
In such situations hygiene is clearly subordinate to the difficult task of injecting, resulting 
from, paradoxically, the same lack of hygiene and high injection frequencies in combination 
with poor self-injection skills. Sometimes it can take so much time to get a hit that the solution 
clogs in the needle or the syringe is completely filled with the blood-drug mixture. As a result, 
the plunger cannot be pulled back anymore and the solution is squirted back on the spoon with 
the possibility of contamination. Female users, in particular when frequently using cocaine, 
may be more susceptible to these problems, as women, in general, have smaller and harder to 
hit veins. (13) Such was the case in the following fieldnote. In this fieldnote, Anja, a 24 year old 
white Dutch female, is sitting in the attic of a dealing place for about two hours, trying to get a 
hit. (This observation was recorded in the same room prior to the observation of the needle 
sharing interaction between Anja and Leo in section 12.2.) She is surrounded by pieces of 
toilet paper, some with blood spots, old syringes containing blood rests, her spoon and a 
plastic lemon. Her left underarm and hand are streaked with dried blood. She is bleeding out 
of several injection sites. Then Eric came in:
<p>
<blockquote>"Look how I'm looking"; she says; I can't hit a vein, I'm trying for more than an 
hour." She removes the long, thin piece of textile she is using to bind off, from her arm and 
turns it around her wrist. She wants to try her hand again. She sticks in the needle several 
times, turning it around under her skin in search of a vein. The syringe is filled with blood. She 
groans when she moves the needle around under her skin. Eric tells her to watch out for the 
blood to congeal. "Otherwise it will choke up your needle", he says. Anja replies, "I know, I 
have put it back on the spoon two times already, heated it and pull it back in again through the 
filter." She is pointing towards the spoon with the bloody filter still in it, while the syringe 
stays in her other hand. Eric asks her now if he can use her spoon to prepare his shot. Anja 
says, "Okay, but you have to clean it proper". Eric takes the spoon from the ground, walks 
with it to a garbage can aside of the table and with a piece of paper he took from the table he 
wipes the bloody filter out of the spoon. Then he walks towards the sink and cleans the spoon 
thoroughly with cold water and a piece of toilet paper. When he's finished he carefully 
examines the spoon to see if he has cleaned it well. </blockquote>
<p>
Ensuing Eric uses Anja's spoon to prepare his shot. Then Anja uses the spoon to reboil her 
dose of gravy (the mixture of the drug solution and blood) for the third time. A little later Leo 
comes in. He gets some drugs from Eric --who owes him money-- and also uses Anja's spoon, 
after cleaning it with water and toilet paper. 
<p>
Difficulties with injecting due to collapsed veins can increase the risk of HIV-infection in 
several ways. Someone will be more eager to borrow a needle when, as a result of persistent 
failure to enter a vein, the needle has become dull or clogged (Anja asked Eric, but he 
refused), but the syringe may also get filled with blood to the point the plunger cannot be 
pulled back further and the gravy has to be put back in the spoon, thereby fouling the spoon. 
As the preceding observation of Harrie shows, the multiple skin and vein punctures can result 
in blood contact with materials, that may be reused by others.

<b>Potential Routes of HIV-Transmission in Group Drug Injection Interactions</b>
<p>
The preceding two sections discussed the contexts of drug injection interactions that may put 
the actors at risk for HIV-infection. The following figures summarize these interactions and 
present the potential routes of viral transmission. 
<p>
Figure 12.1.A plots the routes in the first interaction between Billy and Dirk. Dirk can become 
infected from the syringe he picked up (route A) and from receptive frontloading, that is, 
having Billy squirt the drug solution into his syringe (route B). Billy can become infected from 
insertive frontloading --inserting his needle in the syringe Dirk found (route C). These risks 
may have been exacerbated, as they inject cocaine. Preparing a shot of cocaine was done by 
cold shaking, without adding heat --which may affect the virus. Figure 12.1.B plots the routes 
in the succeeding interaction between Billy, Dirk and Jack. As in the preceding drug sharing 
interaction, Dirk can become infected from the syringe he found and from Billy's syringe 
(routes A and B). Billy can become infected from the syringe Dirk picked up, but now that 
Dirk used it, also from Dirk (routes C and D). He furthermore loads Jack's used syringe 
(insertive frontloading), which means a third infection possibility (route E). Through receptive 
frontloading Jack can become infected from Billy's needle (route F), but as Billy's needle may 
have picked up virus particles when loading the Syringe Dirk picked up, it can also transfer 
these to Jack's syringe (routes G and H). 
<p>
Figure 12.1.A and 12.1.B clearly demonstrate the intricacy of risk behavior associated with 
drug injecting in groups. In these interactions infection could have taken place via at least 11 
transmission routes.
<p>
In the situation presented in figure 12.2 two distinct high risk interactions can be observed. 
Eric used Anja's spoon to prepare his shot (route A) and leo borrowed Anja's spoon (route B) 
and one of her used syringes (route C). Both the spoon and the syringe contain blood rests. All 
actors were aware of the potential risks of these exchanges. AIDS is not only discussed, but 
extensive efforts were undertaken to clean Anja's works before use. However, water is 
generally considered an insufficient disinfectant. (1 2) As a result, HIV may have been conveyed 
via three distinct routes. 
<p>
Figure 12.2
<p>
Figure 12.3 represents a situation in which the actors both possessed new syringes. They 
bought drugs from the money they made together. The drugs were divided by frontloading, 
but only because they both used new syringes this is without risk. But, nothing is so certain as 
the unexpected --by accident Abdul dropped his syringe and damaged the needle which 
resulted in an infection risk for Abdul.
<p>
Figure 12.3
<p>
As all men in the situation presented in figure 12.4 used new syringes, again, this interaction 
appeared harmless. But in this case appearance is deceptive, as the use of the collective water 
container may have resulted in three routes of transmission. 
<p>
Figure 12.4
<p>
Figure 12.5
<p>
Figure 12.5 indicates three routes of transmission: To prepare a shot of heroin John took a 
spoon from a cup, which contained several for common use (route A). Shortly after him, Cor 
used the same spoon to prepare a shot of cocaine (route B and C). The route leading from 
John to Cor may bear the highest risk (route C). Cor hardly cleaned the spoon before use and 
he cold-shaked his cocaine injection. The probability of viral transmission may have increased 
considerably, due to these two factors. 
<p>
Transmission risks may further increase when filters are left   in a used spoon and reused with 
that spoon. The routine sharing of spoons is often an unconscious practice. As pointed out, 
spoons belong to the standard inventory of most house addresses and are used by both IDUs 
and non-IDUs --who use spoons to prepare cocaine for smoking, normally using ammonia. 
Ammonia as well as lemon, ascorbic or vinegar --used to acidify the solution when preparing a 
heroin injection-- may affect the virus. (7) In particular ammonia seems to qualify. Spoons at 
addresses where both smoking and injecting is practiced may thus be safer, than those 
exclusively used by IDUs. Not only in the interactions in figures 12.1.A, 12.1.B and 12.5 
spoons played a role, in the other cases they may also have been additional transmission 
vectors. 
<p>
Except in the case presented in figure 12.5, the shared use of water containers and spoons, 
needle sharing and frontloading took place in the context of sharing drugs. This, again, 
demonstrates the drawbacks of the concept of needle sharing. It is too narrow to describe the 
intricate interactions that may put IDUs at risk for HIV-infection.

<b>Discussion</b>
<p>
Increased availability of drugs is thought to affect consumption by increasing the prevalence of 
use. (14) Less attention has been given to the harmful effect of decreased availability of drugs. 
Availability-related variables, such as rising prices, decreasing purity, and unstable supplies can 
be seen as factors determining the onset of injecting. (15 16 17) The results presented in this 
dissertation show that if availability variables are held relatively stable over time, minimizing 
economic pressure to initiate and maintain injecting, a predominant smoking pattern can 
develop. Thus, injecting can be seen as adaptation to the conditions of decreased drug 
availability. 
<p>
The availability of needles plays a major role in needle sharing. (16 18 19 20) A convincing 
illustration of this factor is the high prevalence of needle sharing in prison. (21) Traditionally, in 
the Netherlands, syringes have been easily obtainable. Since the AIDS epidemic the availability 
of syringes has increased due to the needle exchange programs. Furthermore, in contrast to 
other countries, the possession of injecting equipment has never been a cause of arrest in the 
Netherlands. (13 16 18 22 23) Risk of arrest discourages IDUs from carrying their personal injection 
equipment which limits so called on the spot availability, thereby increasing the frequency of 
sharing drug paraphernalia. The most dramatic indication of the importance of availability is 
the comparison of the low syringe sharing rates in the United Kingdom (24 25) and the 
Netherlands, (26) and the high rates in many cities of the U.S.A. (27)
<p>
The results of this field study support the hypothesis that under the conditions of stable 
availability of drugs and syringes and a decriminalization of possession, needle sharing 
decreases markedly. Nevertheless, research in Europe and the United States is documenting 
that IDUs are changing their behavior toward less risky injecting practices, despite the absence 
of Dutch conditions. (24 28 29 30 31 32) There seems to be a growing awareness of health and a 
willingness to use drugs in safer, more responsible ways. The field research found only a small 
incidence of irresponsible behavior in inexperienced IDUs or those experiencing craving 
intensified by cocaine. Several recent studies have shown a relationship between cocaine use, 
risk behaviors and HIV-serostatus. (33 34 35 36)
<p>
In numerous studies, the social organization of the drug subculture has also been associated 
with needle sharing. Drug users are often organized in small friendship groups. (37 38) These 
friendship groups are often linked in networks whose paramount activity is to obtain and 
distribute money and drugs (37 38) Both items are often shared and used together with other 
necessities of life. Sharing and its associated pattern of reciprocal aid provides a practical and 
emotional balance of the daily hardship of addict life. In the pre-AIDS era needle sharing fitted 
snugly into this pattern. Helping a fellow addict with a syringe was an expression of the almost 
universal subcultural code of share what you have. (39) These sharing behaviors function not only 
to satisfy individual craving, but also to support the maintenance of the network through the 
expression of community solidarity and the instrument of economic exchange. (37) In the AIDS 
era, needle sharing has lost its functionality, being transformed into a threat to the individual 
drug user, the friendship groups, networks, and the drug subculture as a whole. As with most 
cultural shifts, the process is gradual and never complete. Residues of the traditional code still 
remain and can be observed in emotional appeals and convenient lapses in newly acquired 
knowledge.
<p>
Paralleling other studies, the presented results show that, even under the most optimal 
conditions, IDUs can and do get into situations in which sterile injection equipment is not 
available. In contrast with novice IDUs, experienced injectors are likely to be more competent 
in managing such situations. (24 40) Continued risk behavior among IDUs has been associated 
with perceived availability (41 42) and group differences in obtainability, whereas minority IDUs 
experience more problems in acquiring new syringes. (43) Poly drug use, benzodiazepine use, 
psychiatric problems and fatalism are also associated with needle sharing, (44 45 46) as was 
injecting at shooting galleries.(44 47) These factors may, however, largely correlate with social 
factors, which negatively impact on a person's life structure, such as unstable living conditions, 
homelessness, poverty and absence of perspective on improvement. (13 25 46 48) 
<p>
In conclusion, these findings suggest that needle sharing often is the outcome of structurally or 
situationally determined social interaction. Knowledge alone is not enough to counter the 
pressure of social interaction and drug craving. If clean syringes are not easily available in 
these stressful situations, the magnitude of addiction will ultimately lead IDUs to unsafe 
injection practices. While easy access and sufficient supply of clean syringes is effective, as van 
de Hoek, et al. conclude, (26) it is not enough. They recommend intensive counseling in future 
prevention education efforts. The findings also support their suggestion by identifying a 
number of factors that determine needle sharing. These factors should be addressed in 
counseling that focuses on the practical skills of safe drug use. Furthermore, the results 
indicate that changes in the social environment may be more important than changes in 
individual risk behaviors. Prevention efforts may be made more effective through the 
mobilization of collective social resources directed at preventing risk situations. IDUs and 
their networks should have a prominent role in such approaches, an idea that is getting more 
attention. (49 50) In Rotterdam the findings have shown that outreach programs that work 
together with IDUs to reinforce positive protective factors such as rules of safe use while, at 
the same time, distribute syringes to unknown IDUs via known ones can be effective in 
changing the environment (see chapter 14). Utilizing the knowledge of drug users and their 
information and exchange networks in promoting risk reduction through peer education and 
peer support might offer more perspective on a lasting behavior change than any other 
prevention effort.

<B>Introduction</B>  
<P>  
The exchange of infected blood from user to user during the injection process is currently  
believed to be the primary means of transmission of the Human Immunodeficiency  
Virus (HIV) among injecting drug users (IDUs).(1, 2, 3, 4) Such blood-blood contact can  
be established through various routes, of which needle sharing has received the bulk of  
attention in both the mass media and the scientific literature. As is established in the  
previous two chapters, this has blurred the view on other, distinct, potentially hazardous  
parts of the process of preparing and self-administering an injection of drugs. Sharing  
water, used for cooking and rinsing, sharing of other drug injection paraphernalia, and,  
most notably, sharing of collectively prepared drug solutions can all include risks of viral  
transmission. But, needle sharing is a limited concept for more reasons. While lending,  
borrowing, passing on and renting a syringe may be covered by the term, from a semantic  
point of view, picking up a needle that another user left behind (as Dirk did in chapter  
12.2) can hardly be called an act of sharing. After all, sharing requires at least two  
participants.  
 <P>  
This subtle, but important semantic distinction is also of main interest to  
the question dealt with in this chapter: Is needle sharing a ritual? In the context of this  
dissertation this question cannot be omitted. But besides theoretical, there are also  
pragmatic public health considerations. For one thing, if needle sharing is a ritualized  
behavior, this should have consequences for education and prevention campaigns aimed  
at IDUs. And in fact, the argument that needle sharing is a ritual is often put forward in  
objections to harm reduction oriented approaches towards the HIV epidemic among  
IDUs, such as needle exchange. This chapter will explore the question whether or not the  
sharing of needles is a self-perpetuating ritualized part of injecting drug use. First, it will  
review the existing literature on ritualized needle sharing. In this review special attention  
will be directed at the terminology and definitions used. It will critically examine  
statements and conclusions made and extensively screen data presented and the  
references these are supported with. Secondly, needle sharing will be discussed in light of  
the definitions and theories of ritual and the findings reported in this thesis. From the  
preceding linguistic discussion it can already be derived that not all events that are  
generally included in the term needle sharing are expressions of ritual. Picking up and  
using a left behind fit can impossibly be considered a ritual. The coincidental nature of  
such an event excludes the development of a stereotypical sequence--a basic requirement  
of ritual. Furthermore, a symbolic goal cannot be distinguished in this incident, as sharing  
requires more than one person. It takes two to tango. The primary focus of this discussion  
will be if, and under what conditions needle sharing can be regarded a ritual behavior.  
Finally, the chapter will investigate who herald the notion of ritual needle sharing--on  
what do they base their statements; what are their motives.

<B>Ritual Aspects of Needle Sharing: A Review of the Literature</B>  
<P>  
In preparing this review it was surprising to learn that little is written about actual needle sharing events in  
their socio-cultural context. Even less studies discuss or mention ritual in relation to needle sharing.  
An extensive review produced 13 papers which discussed ritual or symbolic aspects of  
needle sharing. Eight of these were published by (US) American, one by Canadian and  
four by European authors.  
<P>  
The first two highly derivative articles, by Tempesta and Di Giannantonio, discuss the relations between  
needle sharing and the high prevalence of HIV among Italian IDUs. Despite the alleged absence of  
restrictions for over the counter sale of syringes and needles, the HIV-seroprevalence in Italy is among the  
highest in Europe, which is, as Moss writes, indeed alarming.(5) This so-called Italy argument has  
also been put forward against needle exchange and other efforts to liberalize the availability of injection  
equipment, e.g. in the USA. Tempesta and Di Giannantonio explain the high Italian HIV seroprevalence  
rates in terms of "insufficient knowledge" and "ritual and special patterns of behavior." (6) The authors  
claim that in their study, HIV-seropositive IDUs tended to share needles for ritual and habitual reasons,  
while the HIV-seronegative IDUs shared because of temporary difficulties in finding a syringe. In  
both groups promiscuity was common, but, according to the authors, in the former group this behavior had  
ritualistic characteristics, while in the latter group promiscuity seemed due to circumstantial reasons. It is  
unclear what the authors mean with this statement. A study into the sexual practices of 1214 Italian  
heterosexual IDUs did not mention such peculiarities.(7) They describe the former group as "heavily  
conditioned to the ritualistic and social use of drugs in which needle sharing has a high symbolic  
meaning." (8) "[T]heir peculiar psychopathology prevents them from being sensitive to prevention-promoting  
campaigns. Moreover, for this group, every injection is a symbolic challenge to death. Thus, these subjects  
feel a drive for drugs which is stronger than any other consideration."(6)  
<P>  
In neither article do the authors define the terms they use and their bold statements are not supported by the  
presented data or by references. The impression of IDUs they present bears more resemblance to a tabloid  
caricature than a scientific representation of research results.  
<P>  
The paradoxical Italian situation--absence of official restrictions on needle availability and a high infection  
rate--may well be explained by a combination of alternative, more down-to-earth, factors. For example,  
Rezza et al. found that almost half of their IDU subjects affirmed to have shared needles because of  
unavailability.(9) Furthermore, apparently citing the Rezza et al. study (without reference), Tempesta and  
Di Giannantonio add that nine percent shared "because syringe purchase presented problems." (8) This  
suggests a discrepancy between the official availability in pharmacies and drug stores, and the actual  
availability, as experienced and perceived by IDUs. Tempesta's and Di Giannantonio's allusion that  
pharmacists might refuse to sell syringes to IDUs may be an important factor underlying the discrepancy  
between official syringe policies and IDUs' perceived availability of injection equipment. Several Italian  
heroin users at the Rotterdam Central Railway Station denied that syringes can be purchased without  
prescription in pharmacies and drug stores.(10) This situation is not specific for Italy, as in both the  
Netherlands and in most parts of the United Kingdom syringes and needles have never been scheduled, but  
significant numbers of pharmacists are, both before and after the consequences of needle sharing for the  
AIDS epidemic became apparent, reluctant to sell syringes to IDUs.(11, 12, 13) The Italian situation is  
presumably exacerbated by a disastrous combination of a lack of knowledge about HIV and AIDS and an  
insufficient or too late educational intervention. Feldman and Biernacki compared the Italian situation with  
the San Francisco gay scene in the first stage of the epidemic:  
<BLOCKQUOTE>  
[C]ondoms were available to gay men in San Francisco during the period when the virus was spreading  
through the homosexual population. The fact that they were not used seems more the result of gay  
men not knowing that unprotected sex, particularly anal intercourse, allowed the virus to enter their bodies.  
The missing ingredient, we are suggesting is the concerted education campaign ...(14)  
</BLOCKQUOTE>  
 <P>  
In the Rezza et al. study nearly 20% of the people, who reported that they never shared needles, were  
seropositive.(9) Therefore, other risk behaviors conceivably have played a role in the rapid spread of HIV  
among Italian IDUs. These may be sexual practices, such as high levels of unprotected sex, or drug use  
related, such as frontloading or similar drug sharing practices.  
<P>  
In Britain, the ethnographer Power noted that "there is no ritualism associated with the sharing of needles  
and syringes. ...Sharing in Britain results from the shortage of freely available needles and syringes."(13)  
The needle exchange evaluation studies by Stimson et al. confirmed this view. They showed that in Britain  
needle sharing is largely determined by availability problems, situational and social factors (e.g.,  
homelessness).(15, 16, 17) However, Ghodse et. al. doubt the positive effect of an increased availability of  
syringes on needle sharing, "[b]ecause sharing of syringes is associated with a feeling of community  
among drug users and not only with a shortage of needles."(18) This statement is, however, not based  
on their findings, but references a letter to the editor of the New England Journal of Medicine by the  
American researchers Black et al.  
<P>  
In their report on a study at the Dallas Veterans Administration Hospital Black et al. also question the  
effectivity of increased syringe availability without educational interventions, "since needle sharing has  
been found to be associated with socialization, communal feelings, and protection in the drug subculture,  
not merely with shortages of needles." (19) Again, this is not an empirical finding of the research reported,  
but a reference to a 1970 study by Howard and Borges(20) (in the letter the two references are mixed up).  
<P>  
Likewise, Newmeyer et al. refer to "the ritual of needle sharing"(21) and Newmeyer writes "[E]ven if rigs  
are abundant, there remain social and psychological reasons for sharing (for example, the expression of  
interpersonal trust or bonding)."(22) The authors, however, fail to explain what they mean by ritual and do  
not support their statements with empirical evidence or references.  
<P>  
Smith claims that "needle sharing is an integral part of the drug taking ritual" and that "sterile needles will  
not eliminate that ritual, but it will reduce some of theassociated medical risk."(23) However, just as the  
preceding publications, this article does not present empirical data to support this statement. Smith also  
doubts the effectivity of needle distribution:  
<BLOCKQUOTE>  
The assumption that distribution of free needles will change the ritual and that each individual will use  
their own outfit except when they are really high or junk sick is questionable at best, because addiction is  
characterized by a compulsion to use, the loss of control and continued use in spite of adverse  
consequences.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>  
This articleis confusing and inaccurate in several aspects. The supposed awareness of street addicts  
"of the risk of AIDS associated with needle sharing" is supported with a reference to the Howard and  
Borges article (20), published in 1970, well before the onset of the AIDS epidemic in the USA. A clear  
mistake. The above mentioned Black et al. study is extensively cited. Smith uses the same quote on  
symbolic meanings of needle sharing as Ghodse (which as already demonstrated, is based on the Howard  
and Borges article). Some percentages of the Black et al. study are presented, but two of the cited  
percentages on needle sharing do not match the original report in the New England Journal of Medicine.  
Furthermore the impression is created as if two distinctive studies are cited, because not only the original  
study is mentioned, but also a review of this study, without connecting the two.(24) For a large part these  
mistakes and inaccuracies may be the result of the author's casual reading.  
<P>  
But after reviewing both sources carefully one cannot but conclude that Smith's writing displays  
carelessness of plagiaristic proportions. Many sentences have the (almost) exact wording of the review  
without quotation marks, one time referencing the original paper, the other the review. This also explains  
the mistakes to a great degree. The sentences that give the (wrong) percentages on needle sharing are exact  
copies of the review, but reference the original report. One of these percentages is a copy of a mistake of  
the reviewer, in the other the integers are transposed. The inaccurate AIDS awareness reference to the  
Howard and Borges article is also a copy of a mistake of the reviewer. Likewise, the quote on the symbolic  
meanings of needle sharing also leans heavily on the wording of the review. Surely in these last two  
instances the author should have known better, as in 1972 he himself edited a book in which the Howard  
and Borges article was reprinted.(25)  
<P>  
Three of the discussed articles refer to the Howard and Borges article.(20) This article is one of the very  
few empirical studies into the ritual aspects of needle sharing. It discusses the results of fifty interviews  
held in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco in 1968. The article is frequently cited in  
contemporary publications on the relationship between needle sharing and HIV transmission. Therefore it  
was reviewed with extra attention. According to the methods section, the study subjects were non-  
randomly selected based on appearance and interviewed by a student interviewer.  
<P>  
People that denied injecting drug use and, with a few exceptions, IDUs who denied needle sharing were  
excluded from the sample. Females were deliberately oversampled. Of a subsample of 36 (18m, 18f), 11  
subjects (8 f, 3m) had injected drugs less than ten times altogether. The median ages were 20.5 for males  
and one and a half years younger for females. The overwhelming majority of subjects had life time  
experience with narcotics, sedative hypnotics, amphetamines, LSD and other synthetic or botanical  
hallucinogens, cannabis and other psychoactive preparations, either orally (swallowing or smoking) or  
parenterally.  
<P>  
The study showed that almost all subjects were aware of the negative consequences of needle sharing and  
they tried to counter these by a variety of measures and techniques. Pragmatic considerations were found to  
be the dominant incentives for sharing needles: The shortage of needles and syringes was most often  
mentioned as reason for needle sharing, followed by fear of arrest and economic incentives --"it saves the  
cost of outfits and because sharing can be tantamount to sharing drugs" (one has the dope, the other the  
works).(20) Sharing was found to be part a more general pattern, as food, lodging and drugs were  
frequently shared. Subjects said they generally shared needles at home or at a friends residence, with  
friends or intimates, rarely with strangers.  
<P>  
Females shared needles more often than males. 65% of the women had never shot alone compared to 25%  
of the men. 56% of women compared to 17% of the men always shared needles. 68% of the males  
compared to 29% of the females had at one time or another injected themselves. These differences  
are explained in terms of socialization into injecting drug use and traditional sex role differentiation.  
Traditional sex roles can thus be seen to restrict women's availability of both drugs and works, as one of  
the female subjects expressed, "My husband would not get me a new point. The only way I can get the  
dope is by sharing with him."  
<P>  
Only after being prompted, 20% of the sample mentioned "a feeling of closeness" in sharing. However,  
when discussing group shooting in general 20% spontaneously mentioned the importance of relating to  
others and feeling a sense of community, while 32% emphasized communicational aspects and the sharing  
of experiences. When discussing "means of protection" the distinction between needle sharing and group  
shooting was blurred by the respondents, but 18% of the sample mentioned feelings of security and  
protection provided by the group. The authors argue that "sharing needles leads to a greater protection than  
shooting in a group with one's own fit, because sharing conveys a greater sense of identification, bondage,  
and responsibility." This argument is, however, not really supported by their data or by preferences.  
Moreover, the argument that needle sharing leads to shooting the same amount of the drug, which is  
perceived safer by the authors, is inaccurate for two reasons. First, shooting the same amount is not very  
likely as the injected dose highly depends on individual tolerance levels. In particular in mixed groups of  
experienced and unexperienced users or in initiations such a practice may even be dangerous. And second,  
titration of individual doses does not require needle sharing.  
<P>  
The article also discusses status achievement and the findings indicate that status is allocated with drug  
tolerance, needle tracks and injecting skills, and the willingness to share drugs. Ensuing, the sexual  
connotation of sharing needles is addressed and the authors suggest sexual overtones to needle usage.  
Finally, the authors discuss self-destructive and masochistic aspects of injecting drug use. They speculate  
that such tendencies may help explain endured needle sharing in spite of knowledge of the negative  
consequences. However, the results presented on the last three items (status achievement, sexual  
connotations and self-destructive/masochistic refer to needle usage and not to needle sharing and can  
therefore hardly be used in explaining the latter.  
<P>  
This article provides a unique view of the social setting of injecting drug use in a group of San Franciscan  
hippies. But its results are not definitive, as it has some important limitations. In particular the findings on  
the often cited "community feelings," "security/protection" and "socialization" must be considered with  
considerable caution. It is rather ambiguous if the presented data on these items exclusively refers to needle  
sharing or to group injecting in general. Not only the subjects seemed to mix them up, but data on group  
drug use are used to support statements on needle sharing. Therefore, the presented results do not  
convincingly show that needle sharing is a self-perpetuating ritual in the study sample. As the article  
indicates, needle sharing often appeared in the context of drug sharing, which, as chapter nine  
demonstrated, is an important part of group drug taking and often does have symbolic functions. The quote  
of one female subject, "In some circles there's a social stigma if you don't share," may well address the  
wider practice of drug sharing.  
<P>  
A second, and more important, shortcoming is the generalizability of the results. As the authors suggest, it  
is indeed important to know how (a)typical their sample is for other IDU populations. In the present  
decade, the second in the AIDS-era, this question is more opportune than ever. The second half of the  
1960s was an atypical and turbulent time. The hippie subculture, the Vietnam war and the anti-war  
movement, the sexual revolution and upcoming drug use among white (middle class) youth all fused in a  
juncture of which the main, and lasting, characteristics were the emancipation of youth and the diffusion  
of drug use into large segments of most Western nations. Since then, things have changed rather  
drastically. For the AIDS generation the day-to-day worries of the love generation have lost most of their  
validity. Make love not war has been replaced by a more sabre-rattling slogan: War on Drugs. In the  
western hemisphere drug use has become a stable phenomenon, while in many drug producing countries  
and the former socialist countries drug use is booming as new consumer markets develop. (26, 27, 28)  
More than half of the sample in the Howard and Borges study never self-injected drugs.(i) Combined with  
their drug use characteristics, this strongly suggests that many of this study's subjects were in a beginning,  
experimental phase of their drug use careers. Moreover, their sociodemographic characteristics only  
minimally match those found among current IDU populations.(7, 15, 29, 30, 31) Finally, the specific  
ideology and spirit of the times of the <P>late 1960s may have influenced the self-images and assessment  
of drug use variables by the research subjects. As the authors write in their conclusion, "the relative  
importance of the various possibilities involved in sharing is yet to be determined."  
<P>  
Des Jarlais and his colleagues reported on needle sharing in the social setting of the pre-AIDS drug  
subculture in New York City. Their well documented descriptions of the social context of needle sharing  
emphasize the subcultural context of injecting drug use. They describe a highly repressed social structure  
around the procurement and use of drugs in which "interpersonal trust is in precarious balance with a  
generalized mistrust."(32) This deviant subculture shares values, rules and language, and functions as a  
communication network spreading oral information about drug availability, police actions and other  
valuable information.(33) In general, their findings match the results presented in chapter nine, although  
the level of repression, due to the ongoing drugs war, seems to result in more extreme situations and  
behaviors. They found that in the pre-AIDS period, needle sharing was usually associated with initiation  
into use--the person to be inducted normally did not carry a syringe--, the use of shooting galleries, and  
practical utility and social bonding between running partners.(32) In particular "the sharing of needles  
within such running partner relations symbolizes a social bonding that makes it very difficult for one or  
more group members to use only his or her own set of works ..."(34) Regarding pre-AIDS needle sharing  
Des Jarlais et al. write:  
<BLOCKQUOTE>  
Prior to concern about AIDS, the sharing of drug injection equipment was normal behavior among IV drug  
users. There were multiple reasons for sharing, from the social norms within the small friendship groups to  
greater availability of used equipment when a person had drugs to inject. While there was some concern  
about hepatitis, there were no overriding reasons not to share drug injection equipment.(33)  
</BLOCKQUOTE>  
Finally one recent report from Canada claimed that needle exchange and similar strategies "would be  
generally ineffective, because [among other reasons] sharing needles communally [w]as part of  
the sexual ritual of fixing."(35) Data to substantiate this bold statement was, however, not presented.  
<P>  
Based on this literature review it is clear that scientific support for the thesis that ritual is a self-  
perpetuating ritual is scanty. None of the discussed studies utilized explicit definitions of ritual. All but two  
studies fail to support statements regarding the alleged symbolic properties of needle sharing with  
empirical data. Some authors just present the argument without reference. In other papers references are  
mixed up or inappropriate. A questionable practice of chain-referencing has been found, leading back to  
the in 1970 published study of Howard and Borges. Reading the original study makes it clear that many of  
those referencing it failed to do so. The findings of this study must, however, be interpreted with reticence.  
Moreover, both this study and those of Des Jarlais and colleagues on the ritual and symbolic aspects of  
needle sharing reflect drug use situations (long) before the onset of AIDS. It can thus be concluded that the  
studied literature does not give a decisive answer to the question whether contemporary needle sharing is a  
ritualized part of drug using behavior and if so, under what conditions such rituals develop.

<B>Needle Sharing and Conditions for Ritualization</B>  
<P>  
The reviewed literature offers thus little empirical evidence to support the idea of a needle sharing ritual,  
independent of other social, psychological, cultural and economic influences. But, as the extensive  
literature review on the concept of ritual (chapter two) suggested, in essence all behavior may be subject to  
ritualization processes. From that perspective needle sharing is not an exception. In order to determine the  
ritual dimensions of needle sharing, it must be examined in light of the relevant definitions of ritual and  
ritual objects. In particular, the conditions regarding injecting equipment and those regarding illegal drug  
use in general must be considered. In short, these definitions state the following requirements: For an event  
to be a ritual event it must follow a prescribed sequence of psychomotor acts which has special meaning  
for the performer.(36) The condition of special meaning has a double meaning, referring to instrumental  
and symbolic goals. The ritual value of an object--its capacity for ritualization--is determined by the  
subjective importance it has gained due to its scarcity.(37, 38, 39) Through a low availability, objectively  
important objects are transformed into subjectively important objects. This may lead to the appendage of  
symbolic elaboration (social importance) to the object, increasing the ritual value. (For a detailed  
discussion see chapter two).  
<P>  
<i>Needle sharing Compared with Drug Sharing--Different Objects, Different Statuses</i>
<P>
As has been demonstrated in chapters nine and eleven, drugs were often shared among the research  
subjects and, in general, these sharing events fulfilled the definitional requirements of ritual interaction.  
Not only standardized interaction sequences were observed in these drug sharing events, but these  
interactions served both instrumental and symbolic purposes. In contrast, needle sharing as a planned or  
stereotypical sequence in which two or more people share a syringe was not ever observed. A typical  
pattern of needle sharing was non-existent. The recorded cases of needle sharing could not be interpreted in  
terms of ritual interaction and were mainly determined by situational variables (see chapter twelve). This  
difference is explained by the disparate statuses of the two objects in regards to the definitional  
requirements of ritual and ritual objects. Drugs, such as heroin and cocaine, not only have a recognized  
objective importance among their users, but due to prohibition and the resulting exorbitant black market  
prices they have become scarce objects. Therefore, they gained substantial subjective importance and have  
become the instrumental imperative for the formation of a drug-centered community.(40) Not surprisingly,  
drugs are the most important incentive for, and subject of, interaction in this community. Sharing drugs has  
both short term and long term instrumental advantages. It prevents instances of intensive withdrawal  
experiences, as there is normally a fellow user willing to help with a betermakertje. This has created a  
network of mutual obligations which surpass debts between individual users. Drug sharing is also  
inundated with symbolic meaning. Sharing drugs facilitates contact and communication, smothers conflict  
and reinforces enduring relationships among individuals of equal (deviant) status. Strict norms have  
developed around the sharing of drugs. Drug sharing sanctions the integration into normatively regulated  
social behavior of the activities which the users' desire for drugs urge them to perform.(41) Ultimately,  
drug sharing is aimed at maintaining the subculture. In contrast, needles have never been restricted in the  
Netherlands and due to the exchange programs, sterile injection equipment can normally be easily  
obtained. Although needles hold a recognized objective value in the IDU subculture, the easy availability  
of new needles precludes the regular sharing of used ones. Because needle sharing is not a regular event,  
there is no room for the development of stylized, stereotypical behavioral sequences. The absence of  
scarcity likewise prevents the development of subjective importance and the addition of community values.  
<P>  
<i>The Netherlands v.s. the USA--Different Drug Policy Contexts, Different Outcomes</i>
<P>  
In the United States drug sharing has also been documented, representing similar community values.(14, 33  
36, 42, 43) The legal status of heroin and cocaine is not essentially different in the USA and the  
Netherlands--in both countries these drugs are illicit. However, the enforcement policies can be seen to  
diverge substantially. While the Dutch approach has resulted in rather stable and less violent drug  
subcultures, the work of Des Jarlais et al. and other research groups indicate that in America the  
subcultures surrounding these drugs are volatile and violent.(32) Generalized feelings of mistrust, though  
not completely absent among Dutch users, seem more normative among American users. The, compared to  
the Dutch situation, lower and less stable drug availability has not only induced a more elaborated  
monetarization of mutual services (for example commercially exploited shooting galleries, needle rental  
and paid house doctors) (32, 44, 45), but sharing behaviors, symbolized by the sharing of drugs, seem less  
consistent and limited to smaller groups or networks around the individuals, exemplified by the dyadic  
relationship of running partners.(14, 46) When sharing is limited to only the most significant other(s), the  
event increasingly becomes distinguishing and revered, thereby increasing the binding force of the  
ritual.  
<P>  
In contrast with that of drugs, the legal status of injection equipment in the USA and the Netherlands is  
significantly different. In the Netherlands injection equipment has never been scheduled, while in most  
states of the USA they are. After the development of the Model Drug Paraphernalia Act by the Drug  
Enforcement Administration in 1979, thirty-eight states and the District of Columbia have passed laws  
based on the model act, while an additional nine states have passed similar laws. With a broad range of  
other drug paraphernalia, these laws prohibit the distribution and possession of drug injection equipment.  
The Federal Mail Order Drug Paraphernalia Control Act, enacted in 1986, criminalized the interstate  
transport of these objects.(47) These laws did not criminalize up to then unscheduled objects, but merely  
streamlined the existing legislation. It is therefore not surprising that the little empirical evidence for  
ritualization or symbolic elaboration around needle sharing comes from the USA comes, to be concise,  
from New York City and San Francisco. Both cities are located in states with legal restrictions on the  
availability and possession of hypodermic syringes and needles.  
<P>  
These legal restrictions have limited the overall availability of injection equipment significantly, while fear  
of arrest on possession charges often discourages IDUs to carry their personal set which further reduces  
their on-the-spot availability. The low availability has turned needles into scarce commodities in the  
American drug subculture. This structural scarcity increased their (subcultural) economic value and  
inspired several expressions of monetarization around the provision of needles. Hopkins documented a  
structural black market in needles.(48)(ii) In addition to new needles, needle sellers not infrequently sold  
resealed used needles as new. Such profiteering may put IDUs unknowingly at risk for HIV infection. Used  
needles are often anonymously used at commercial shooting galleries, which are documented sources of  
HIV spread.(3, 49) In a shooting gallery individuals pay an entrance fee and rent a (mostly used) needle.  
Both needle selling and running a shooting gallery are motivated by economic incentives. For a  
considerable number of users these activities are an important source of income.(iii)  
<P>  
Nevertheless, the low needle availability has created a situation in which ritualization processes around  
needle sharing could develop. But renting a needle at a commercial shooting gallery cannot be interpreted  
in terms of ritual. Galleries mostly serve transient populations and proprietor and visitor have a foremostly  
(short lasting) monetary relationship. Use of shooting galleries is primarily determined by pragmatic  
factors and the use of these venues has been associated with homelessness, lack of financial resources and  
the absence of (friends that could supply) a place to get off.(16, 45) In general, interactions in such places  
do not meet the definitional requirements for ritual interaction.  
<P>  
As Turner pointed out, the closer the bond outside the potential, ritualized situation, the more meaning the  
ritual act will have.(50) Thus, ritualized needle sharing is more expected among IDUs with multiplex  
relationships--(sexual) partners, friends and other close relationships. Although, the preceding literature  
review produced little empirical evidence to substantiate this expectation, the finding that the majority of  
IDUs generally only shares with people they know well (19), is perhaps an indication of social ritualization  
processes. On the other hand, this selectivity is probably better explained as a rational attempt to asses HIV  
infection risks, given the available information. Sharing in tight friendship groups is generally perceived as  
a lower risk than sharing with strangers, by both users(51) and researchers (19), and there is some evidence  
to support this idea.(9) But this protection is of course limited. It only gives protection as long as the virus  
has not been introduced in the group among which injection paraphernalia are shared. When introduced, it  
may, by the same token, spread very rapidly. That may well have been the case in the group of early  
seroconverters in Scotland, reported on by Robertson et al., who, "due to a failure of the supply of clean  
equipment, formed an intimate equipment sharing community".(52)  
 <P>  
Murphy suggested that in couples, needle sharing may substitute feelings of sexual intimacy and represent  
an intimate part of their relationship. Just as in the Howard and Borges study, some of her female subjects  
were dependent on their male partners to inject the drug for them.(53) In such cases needle sharing is part  
of the couples shared use of drugs, whereby the male exercises authority over the female by controlling her  
access to drugs, works, and her veins. Needle sharing has frequently been related to initiation into injecting  
drug use.(20, 32) First injection of an illicit drug is seldom a planned event and the novice does not carry a  
syringe around. If this event is subject to ritualization, it is not so much the sharing of injection equipment  
(on such occasions drugs are mostly also shared) which is the object of the ritual process, but the event  
itself. The event signifies the transition of non-user or, more specific, non-IDU, to the newly acquired  
status of IDU. In such cases needle sharing is merely part of this rite of passage.(54) The most pronounced  
indications of ritualization processes around needle sharing were found among dyads.(32) But, here again  
it is not an isolated phenomenon, but part of a larger sharing pattern, which is the cement of a highly  
entrained relationship.(55)  
<P>  
<i>Primary vs. Secondary Ritual Value</i>  
<P>  
A factor that may limit ritualization of needle sharing is the indirect relationship between the goal (the  
drug high) and the means (the needle). Drug use facilitates interaction and when drugs are shared they  
induce feelings of solidarity and produce a common mood. These are intrinsic features of ritual and a main  
reason for drug use.(55) Use of drugs (irrespective of their legal status and resulting availability) is thus  
directly associated with positively valued altered states of consciousness. Chapters two and nine contended  
that the intensity of ritualization is subject to factors that influence availability. For example, draughts and  
the absence of reliable water distribution systems limit the availability of water and thereby have an impact  
on the ritualization of this necessity of life among certain tribal peoples. Likewise, prohibition and the  
uncertainties of the resulting underground or subcultural drug distribution system limit the availability of  
drugs, contributing to the level of ritualization of drug use. However, with or without these deterrents,  
drugs are, and throughout history have been, used for ritual purposes. Their use is inherent to human (and  
animal) nature.(56) Therefore, it was argued in chapter nine that drugs have intrinsic or primary ritual  
value. In contrast, the ritual value of syringes and other drug paraphernalia is merely derived from their  
association with the drugs. Hence, needles and syringes can only obtain secondary ritual value. To make a  
bold comparison, in the Sahara people ritualize water, not the bucket (but they might if these should  
become scarce).  
<P>  
<i>Ritualization is a Dynamic Process </i>  
<P>  
It must be understood that ritual is not a static condition, but a dynamic process. The significance or  
coercive power of ritual--the power performers ascribe to, and feel forced upon themselves by the  
performance of ritual--can be seen to vary with the intensity of ritualization. This intensity may vary with  
several factors. Social factors define the situation in which the ritual interaction is performed. As Goffman  
explained, different faces, statuses and relationships delimit what is appropriate behavior in a situation.(57)  
Ritual is furthermore embedded in, and an expression of a wider set of cultural values, which also  
determine the pertinence of behavior. Personal factors (perceived availability, religion, etc.) may account  
for variations in perception, interpretation and evaluation of what is and is not (part of the) ritual or what  
the meaning (ranging from purely instrumental to highly symbolic) is of certain acts.(36) The symbolism  
of blood brothers, reported by some subjects in the Howard and Borges study, can therefore best be  
interpreted as personal expressions of symbolism of experimental drug users. As Cleckner writes, "The  
symbolic content of shared customs is not regarded as terribly significant. What is significant is the  
concrete results of effects of any action, not its reality status. The actual texture of street activity is dealing  
with reality as it is. Street customs are predominantly pragmatic and rational with little room for symbolic  
elaboration. A dope fiend can almost always give a practical explanation for anything he does."(58) Most  
committed IDUs are thus too busy taking care of business for such conscious symbolic elaboration of their  
daily activities.(46) On a conscious level, their activities are generally driven by pragmatic, especially  
economic considerations--related to the object that largely determines their daily life.  
<P>  
<i>Adaptation to the Changing Functionality of Needle Sharing</i>  
<P>  
Pragmatism is an essential feature of the lives of IDUs. Maintaining regular injecting drug use requires  
considerable coping skills and the flexibility to adapt to obstacles that (potentially) interfere with drug use  
management. From this functionalistic perspective needle sharing is simply a rational adaptation to the  
legal restrictions on injection equipment. Under these conditions, needle sharing has become the rule.  
Although sharing has always been associated with diseases as hepatitis, abscesses and endocarditis, these  
were only part of the many hazards IDUs had to cope with, and, not unjustly, many others were  
experienced as far more threatening. From the perspective of the IDU, the cost benefit analysis of needle  
sharing has thus always been in favor of this behavior. Until the advent of the HIV epidemic. HIV has  
tipped the balance towards the negative. IDUs are increasingly aware of the threats HIV poses on them and  
they are looking for ways to protect themselves, partners, family and friends. Being denied access to  
services which may support such changes in many countries, in particular in the USA, this is not an easy  
task. However, a large number of recent studies established that under the influence of the AIDS threat all  
over the world IDUs are adopting less risky injecting practices(59, 60), even in the American epicenters of  
AIDS.(61, 62) New needles are in great demand(48) and when shared, used ones are often cleaned with  
bleach.(21) This underlines the instrumental imperative of needle sharing. In the AIDS era, the  
functionality of needle sharing is challenged by the information on the threats it poses on the user and  
her/is relationships--it has gradually become dysfunctional. But due to HIV's long incubation period, the  
consequences of needle sharing have been underplayed, obscured and denied for a long time. For many  
IDUs HIV was only an intangible remote threat, which could simply not compete with more immediate  
needs and threats. As Stern made painfully clear, "AIDS is just not the biggest problem on the block."(63)  
Reduction of personal risk behaviors can only be maintained if these are supported by cultural change, and  
this is a slow process, hampered by prohibition of drugs and injection paraphernalia. As it is much harder  
to break the rule of sharing with close relationships than with strangers and loose acquaintances(32, 64,  
65), one may expect that the process of change started with the latter and will end with intimates,  
presumably before the sharing of other body fluids is terminated.

<B>Who propagates the needle sharing ritual?</B>
<P>
Conducting the literature review it became apparent that several authors put ritual or symbolic aspects of  
needle sharing forward to support their doubts about the effectivity of needle exchange. In particular Smith  
went far beyond what is scientifically acceptable. Elsewhere he made an even more unrealistic claim. In his  
opinion, needle exchange programs would not have an effect on the spread of HIV through needle sharing,  
because such practices are simply part of the drug culture. He furthermore alleged that if ten addicts in a  
room had their own needles, they would all use the same one and simply pass it around.(66) Apparently,  
this quixotic depiction appeals to the public's imagination as some years later it was recorded in an  
interview with a top rank law enforcement officer in New York City:  
<BLOCKQUOTE>  
You are dealing with an addict who is at best very, very unreliable. He does not bathe, he does not wash, he  
wakes up every morning with the purpose of kicking the drug habit and at the same time he is going to get  
some drugs. ... By nature drug addicts, street people, they share things. They share their beds, their bottles,  
they share their women: they share their needles. ... Drug users lie, steal, cheat. That is the make-up of a  
drug addict. ... They have always shared needles, that is their nature, that is their make-up, they share  
things. What is the reason for it? I don't know, but that is their nature. ... We have seen cases where addicts  
were in a room and had needles, that were stolen from a hospital or a pharmacy, in its package, sterile, all  
on the floor and they were sitting around sharing one, probably contaminated, needle among each  
other.(67)  
</BLOCKQUOTE>  
These portrayals are false for at least two reasons. As was explained above, needles are solely instrumental  
in the act of getting high and sharp new ones fulfill this function of getting the drugs into ones system best.  
For what reason would an IDU--who is eager to get off--wait for nine others to finish using the same dull  
needle (which can take a while), while sharp new ones are available? With all respect, such simplistic  
analyses may be expected from an ill-informed and frightened lay audience, but not from professionals. As  
Fiddle pointed out, those working in the area of drug law enforcement ordinarily see drug users at their  
worst.(68) Likewise, Smith is a clinician and his view may be biased by overexposure to poorly coping  
clinical populations, but as he also is involved in research, some reservations in his statements would be  
appropriate.  
<P>  
However, such narrow and ungrounded analyses are not limited to clinicians and law enforcement officials.  
On the contrary, the mythical needle sharing ritual is frequently used to block harm reduction approaches  
against the spread of HIV in this population. In particular, the American administration has consistently  
been using this bogus argument in opposing needle exchange programs and defending restrictive needle  
legislation. For example, Herbert Kleber, former deputy director for demand reduction of the Office of  
National Drug Control Policy (the pentagon of the war on drugs), recently published an editorial in  
which he reflected on the issue of needle exchange. Among several other ungrounded statements, and  
without any references, he claimed that "many addicts would continue to share even if clean needles were  
available; it has become part of the ritual of taking drugs that accompanies an illicit and socially  
condemned activity."(69) Likewise, Charles Schuster, former director of NIDA, affirmed that "[a]lmost all  
intravenous drug users sometimes share their works, for reasons that include convenience, friendship and  
ritual." He wrote this in the foreword of the recent NIDA Research Monograph on needle sharing, which  
determined that the reality of needle sharing situations is far more intricate than suggested.(70)

<B>Conclusions</B>
<P>
The literature review raised no conclusive empirical evidence to support the notion that needle sharing  
among IDUs is a stable ritual, independent of other factors. The two empirical studies that suggest  
symbolic functions of this behavior were conducted before awareness of the HIV-epidemic came about and  
therefore generalization from pre-AIDS to current populations of IDUs may be invalid. The other articles  
add little relevant information, and some of these even spread misinformation about the discussed  
phenomenon. Perhaps the only definite evidence of ritual the review brought up, reflects on the scientific  
culture itself, as a questionable example of ritual referencing was established.  
<P>  
By comparing the conditions of drug and needle use with the relevant definitions of ritual event and ritual  
objects it was demonstrated that the attachment of symbolic elaboration to the use of such objects is  
principally subject to their perceived availability. This explained the ritualization of drug use found in this  
Dutch research and in American studies. In both countries, decreased drug availability has created a  
situation in which the attachment of symbolic meaning to primarily instrumental acts became possible. The  
different levels of ritualization and monetarization around drug use activities between the two countries can  
be attributed to gradual differences in drug availability due to different enforcement policies. The same  
factors explained the absence of a pattern of ritualized needle sharing in the Netherlands and the assumed  
presence of needle sharing rituals in the USA, prior to AIDS awareness. While the easy availability in the  
Netherlands prevented this process, the restrictions on sale and possession in the USA made the addition of  
symbolism to the primarily instrumental act of sharing needles possible. As Carballo and Rezza write in  
their discussion of factors that may restrain the perceived availability of needles and syringes:  
<BLOCKQUOTE>  
Placed in th[e] broader social framework in which drug injecting has been stigmatized, actively prosecuted  
and associated with a range of other social problems, the sharing of needles and syringes may have gone on  
to represent, for some individuals, a symbol of group cohesiveness and solidarity and may have enhanced  
the process as well as the experience of drug injecting.(71)  
</BLOCKQUOTE>  
However, even in the USA there is no substantial evidence in support of ritual needle sharing practices,  
despite these favorable conditions. The assumption that IDUs will not change or reduce their needle  
sharing practices in response to an increased availability, because it is a ritualized behavior pattern cannot  
be supported by scientific data.  
<P>  
This myth is further falsified by a growing number of scientific publications that show significant  
behavior modification towards safer injecting practices, in particular in places where needles and syringes  
are sufficiently available. These studies show furthermore that needle sharing is essentially adaptive  
behavior, induced by unavailability and unfavorable socio-economic conditions. The same conclusions are  
reached on the basis of the current analysis of determinants of ritualization. That is, through input of AIDS  
information and experience, the instrumental imperative of needle sharing is becoming increasingly  
overruled by the potential negative consequences for the individual, his network and the subculture as a  
whole. Knowledge of the current risks of needle sharing is, nevertheless, not a guarantee for (the  
maintenance of) safe injection behavior. Sufficient availability of syringes and needles does prevent the  
development of stereotypical needle sharing patterns. Moreover, it limits the number of situations in which  
needle sharing may, besides abstaining from or postponing a drug injection, become the only choice. But,  
just as the availability of condoms will not entirely stop unprotected sex, it cannot reasonably be expected  
that easy access to needles will eliminate all unsafe injecting. After all, injecting drug use remains a highly  
criminalized, but (for the performers) imperative activity.  
<P>  
The idea of ritualized needle sharing and other stereotypical portrayals of drug users are actively  
propagated by the highest rank executives in the hierarchy of the War on Drugs. Presented as scientific  
facts, they essentially are deceptive political soundbites--the argot of the war on drugs rhetoric. These  
political opportunistic myths fuel addictophobia and obstruct a rational assessment of the drug problem,  
blocking alternative (and more efficient) approaches to stop the spread of AIDS among injecting drug users  
and their relationships. Ultimately, they obstruct peace in the civil war on drug users.
