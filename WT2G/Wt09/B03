MR. KELLY: John Kelly for the estate of Nicole Brown Simpson.

EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI: 

 

Q. Good morning, Mr. Allen. You understand that you are under oath? 

 

A. Yes, I do. 

 

Q. And you understand that you have to tell the truth just as though you 

were testifying in a court of law before a judge and a jury? 

 

A. Yes, I do. 

 

Q.You may have to speak up a little bit the folks at the end of the table 

can hear you. Have you done anything to get ready for this morning's 

deposition? 

 

A. No, I haven't. 

 

Q. Have you read anything? 

 

A. No, I haven't. 

 

Q. Have you spoken to anyone other than your counsel? 

 

A. No, I haven't. 

 

Q. Have you read any of the deposition transcripts or other materials in 

this civil lawsuit against O.J. Simpson? 

 

A. No. 

 

Q. Have you had any contact with any of Mr. Simpson's lawyers since 

Mr. Simpson's acquittal? 

 

A. No. 

 

Q. Mr. Leonard is here for Mr. Simpson. Have you ever spoken to him 

before? 

 

A. Just met him. 

 

Q. Just met him today? And what about some of Mr. Simpson's other 

civil lawyers? Robert Baker? 

 

A.(Witness shakes head). 

 

Q. No. None of them? 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: You have to give audible responses, please. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Yeah. You have to answer audibly. 

 

A. I haven't talked to anyone 

 

Q. Now, do you know whether your lawyers have spoken to Mr. 

Simpson's lawyers? 

 

A. No, I don't. 

 

Q. Have your lawyers told you about things Mr. Simpson's lawyers 

have said? 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: I will object to that as clearly infringing upon 

attorney-client privilege. For the record, Mr. Petrocelli, I haven't 

spoken with any of Mr. Simpson's lawyers. You are the only one in this 

room to whom I have had any conversations with. 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you, Counsel. 

 

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Have you had any contact, Mr. Allen, 

with O.J. Simpson since his release from jail? 

 

A: No, I haven't. 

 

Q: You have not spoken to him on the telephone? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: Or seen him in person? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q. Correct? 

 

A: Correct. 

 

Q: What contact, if any, did you have with Mr. Simpson during the 

time that he was incarcerated from around June 17, 1994, through 

October, 1995? 

 

A. Just the one visit and a couple of phone calls. 

 

Q. And you visited him in the jail cell one time? 

 

A. Yes, I did. 

 

Q. Do you remember when that was? 

 

A. Frankly, no. 

 

Q. Was it shortly after his arrest? 

 

A. I think so. 

 

Q. And you spoke to him there? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. For how long? 

 

A. I don't know how long we were there. Twenty minutes or so. Maybe 

longer. I am not sure. 

 

Q. Was anyone there with you? 

 

A. I think he had a representative. I am not sure. A young lady. And 

my wife was with me. 

 

Q. And your wife is whom? 

 

A. Kathryn Allen. 

 

Q. Kathryn Allen. Do you have any children? 

 

A. No, I don't. 

 

Q. You reside where? 

 

A. Here in Kansas City, Missouri. 

 

Q. And do you also have a residence in Los Angeles? 

 

A. Yes, I do. 

 

Q. And does anyone live there now? 

 

A: You know, occasionally we go back. 

 

Q: So, you haven't rented it out, correct? 

 

A: No, I haven't. 

 

Q: Is that in the Palisades? 

 

A: Yes, it is. 

 

Q: And how long have you maintained that residence in the Palisades? 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Mr. Petrocelli, you are using the term "residence". 

Just so it's understood that there's a house there. I don't want to suggest 

there's any legal connotation of where he resides. I think his testimony 

is he is a resident of Kansas City, Missouri. But that's just for 

clarification. I am sorry. 

 

A: I am not sure. '92, I guess. '90 -- 

 

Q: (By Mr. Petrocelli) You bought the home in the Palisades? 

 

A: I built it. See, that's why I am not sure, you know, when it was 

completed and when it was--when I moved in there. 

 

Q: When was the last time that you regularly lived in that home? 

 

A: I think it was in '93 or '92. Whenever I signed with the Kansas City 

Chiefs, then I became a resident there. 

 

Q. Following the Super Bowl in 1994, January, did you reside in the 

home in the Palisades in Los Angeles between, let's say, January 1994, 

and June 12 of 1994?  

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q: And you, went on a vacation to the Cayman Islands on the evening 

of June 12th, correct? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: And you returned when? 

 

A: I am not sure. 

 

Q: A couple of weeks later? 

 

A: I don't know. Eight or nine days afterwards. I am not sure. 

 

Q: And when you returned from the trip to the Caymans, did you go 

back to the Palisades? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: And how long did you stay there before you left for Kansas City? 

 

A: I am not sure. Obviously I had to go back because of training camp. 

So, I am not quite sure when that was either. I don't have specific dates, 

but I always go back early, you know, and I start training, and we had 

training camp. So -- 

 

Q: When you visited Mr. Simpson in the jail cell, was it during the time 

that you were still living at the Palisades home before you left for 

training camp? 

 

A: Yes 

 

Q: And after you left for training camp in the summer of 1994, did you 

ever return to the Palisades home? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: So, you haven't lived there at all since some time in the early 

summer of 1994; is that correct? 

 

A: That's correct. 

 

Q: Can you relate your discussion with O.J. Simpson in the jail cell? 

 

A: It was just a general discussion about, you know, hanging there, just 

giving him support, just to see how he was doing. That was basically it. 

 

Q: Is there ant topic that you can recall that you and he discussed? 

 

A: No. At the close we just said a prayer, and that was it. 

 

Q: Did you talk about Mr. Simpson's relationship with Nicole? 

 

A: No, I didn't. 

 

Q: Did you talk about Nicole at all? 

 

A: No, we didn't. 

 

Q: Did you talk about any of the evidence? 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: It's not a twister, Dan 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: For the record, that's good old Kansas City 

thunder. 

 

A: No, we didn't. 

 

MR PETROCELLI: I am sorry. Could you read my question back? 

(Whereupon, the question was read back by the Reporter.) 

 

A: No, we didn't. 

 

Q: Did you discuss Mr. Simpson's whereabouts on the evening of June 

12th? 

 

A: Did not. 

 

Q: Did you discuss any of the facts or circumstances relevant to the 

double murder charges against him? 

 

A: No, I didn't. 

 

Q: You said you had a couple of telephone calls with Mr. Simpson? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: I take it he called you? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Called you collect a couple of times? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: While you were in Kansas City? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Compound. 

 

A: I don't know. I mean, that's --- 

 

Q: (By Mr. Petrocelli) how many of them -- 

 

A: -- been a couple of years ago. 

 

Q: And how many of them were there? 

 

A: There were a couple. I can't recall. 

 

Q: When you say a couple, you mean two or three or 10 or 12? What is 

the range here? 

 

A: I am not really sure 

 

Q: Under 10? 

 

A: I think so. Well under 10. 

 

Q: In those conversations did you ever talk about his relationship with 

Nicole? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: Did you talk about Nicole at all? 

 

A: No, we did not. 

 

Q: Did you talk about the evidence against him? 

 

A: No, we did not. 

 

Q: Or the facts or circumstances relevant to the case against him? 

 

A: No, we did not. 

 

Q: All of your discussions with Mr. Simpson, I take it, were just 

general expressions of support for him? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Have you had conversations with anyone about whether or not you 

will testify at the trial in this case, in this civil trial? 

 

A: No, I haven't. No. 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Are you talking about anyone other than his 

attorneys? 

 

Q: (By Mr. Petrocelli) Yeah. Other than your lawyers. 

 

A: No, I haven't. 

 

Q: Do you intend to testify at the trial of this case if called as a witness 

by the defense? 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Under what circumstances?  

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) If the defense calls you up and says, Mr. Allen, 

we would like you to come to Los Angeles to testify live as a witness 

on behalf of O.J. Simpson, do you intend to do so? 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: I object upon the grounds that that would call for 

speculation about something that might happen in the future. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) You may answer. 

 

A. I may answer? 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Yes. 

 

A. Well, clearly I hope this will be enough. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) If the defense asks you to testify even though 

you have already given a deposition, do you plan to comply with their 

request and come to Los Angeles? 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Again calls for speculation. 

 

You can say if you know. 

 

A: I am not sure. I mean , clearly I hope this will put an end to -- you 

know, I feel like I am a really insignificant part of this whole thing and 

I really don't have anything to offer. So, its sort of difficult for me to 

say, you know, why I should come and do that. 

 

Q: (by Mr. Petrocelli) How long have you known O.J. Simpson? 

 

A: Since '70 -- well, I think I met him in '78. 

 

Q: At that time you were entering USC? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: You met him in New York at a Heisman Trophy or some-- 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: What kind of function was it? 

 

A: it was a Hertz No. 1 award. 

 

Q: Hertz. 

 

A: He was-- 

 

Q: And since that time, you became good friends, correct? 

 

A: Yes, we developed a friendship. 

 

Q: And you remained very close friends up until the present, right? 

 

A: Yes 

 

Q: And as of June 12, 1994. O.J. Simpson was one of your closest 

friends, right? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And you and he did many things together over the years, right? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And you and he shared many of the same friends, right? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. For example, you are friendly with A.C. Cowlings, correct? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. First of all, let me see if I understand this. Has your relationship 

with Mr. Simpson changed since June 12, 1994? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And how has it changed? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague. 

 

(By Mr. Petrocelli) You may answer. 

 

A. Well, I think -- I think obviously he was disappointed. 

 

(Off the record.) 

 

VIDEO TECHNICIAN: Okay. 

 

We are going be record at 10:56. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Okay. We are back on the record and before the 

interruption you corrected me and pointed out that A.C. Cowlings is 

actually redundant. His name is Allen Cowlings, right? 

 

A: Right. 

 

Q. And A.C. is a nickname? 

 

A. For Al Cowlings. 

 

Q -- for Al Cowlings. 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q: Okay. What I was asking you about were common friends that you 

and Mr. Simpson shared, and I think I would like to focus the time 

period for now as of June 12, 1994, which, as you know, was the day 

that Nicole was killed, okay? 

 

A: Yes 

 

Q: As of that point in time, you were close friends with Mr. Cowlings, 

true? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q. And with Wayne Hughes? 

  

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Allen Schwartz? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Mark Packar? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Bobby Bender? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Joe Stellini? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Robert Kardashian? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Ron Shipp? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Mark Slotkin? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Allen Austin? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Joe Kolkowitz? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Skip Taft? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Louis Marx? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Tom McCollum? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And these were -- this was the circle of friends that you and Mr. 

Simpson were a part of, right? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And had been for a number of years, right? 

 

A. Right. 

 

Q. And you and Mr. Simpson over the years did things as couples with 

-- him with Nicole and you with your wife, right? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q: And before you were -- when you meet and begin to date Kathryn? 

 

A: '88 

 

Q: And before 1988, you and Mr. Simpson went out with -- him with 

Nicole and you with someone else, right? 

 

A: Sometimes just the three of us. 

 

Q: And you socialized with Mr. Simpson's family as well? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: And you have gotten to know his daughter Arnelle? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

MR. KELLY: Excuse me. Can you speak up just a bit, Marcus? 

 

MR SCHEPERS: Mr. Kelly is having difficulty -- it's your fault, Kelly. 

You had him turn on the air-conditioner. 

 

(Discussion was held off the record) 

 

Video technician: We are back on record. it is 10:01. 

 

(By Mr. Petrocelli): I was asking you before the latest interruption, Mr. 

Allen, about your socializing with Mr. Simpson over the years prior to 

Nicole's death on June 12. You had indicated that you met your wife 

Kathryn in around 1988? 

 

A: Yes 

 

Q. Before then, was there another person in your life who you were 

seeing for a long period of time? 

 

A. No, there wasn't. 

 

Q. You had not been engaged or married before Kathryn? 

 

A. No. 

 

Q. You got to know Mr. Simpson's family, I was asking you? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. You know his daughter Arnelle, correct? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. His daughter Jason - 

 

A. His son Jason. 

 

Q. I mean son Jason? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Have you been in touch with either Arnelle or Jason since Mr. 

Simpson's arrest? 

 

A. No, I haven't. 

 

Q. And did you know Mr. Simpson's two children with Nicole, Sidney 

and Justin? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And have you had any contact with them since Mr. Simpson's 

arrest? 

 

A. No, I haven't. 

 

Q. Or with members of the Brown family? 

 

A. No, I haven't. 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Excuse me. 

(Discussion was held between the witness and his attorney off the 

record.) 

 

A. Oh, yeah. I am sorry. I apologize. Just the one call to Judy Brown to 

give my condolences. I was - but I am not sure whether that was -- may 

have been after the funeral. I don't know. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) You were an usher at Mr. Simpson's wedding? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: His marriage to Nicole? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: In 1985? 

 

A: Yes, whenever. 

 

Q; (By Mr. Petrocelli): You were an usher at Mr. Simpson's wedding? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: His marriage to Nicole? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: In 1985? 

 

A: Yes. Whenever. 

 

Q: Now, you have indicated to me that your relationship with Mr. 

Simpson is different now than it was for all these years, true? 

 

A: Yes, it is. 

 

Q: And it changed when? 

 

A: Well, the -- I think one phone call I think he wanted me to write a 

letter in opposition to an article that I think Time magazine had written, 

and I didn't do that. And I think secondly he also wanted me to testify 

to a conversation that we allegedly had -- well, excuse me, a 

conversation that we had in reference to my admitting to him or 

something of that -- you know, the fact about a relationship with his 

ex-wife, and the conversation, it wasn't true. The relationship didn't 

happen. And, so, I think he got upset with me, and obviously I felt -- 

really -- I felt really sort of -- I was in a tough position, and I think 

thereby the conversation never took place again. I am sure he was 

disappointed, and I was sort of disappointed too, that I couldn't help 

him as a friend, but I couldn't go there and say these things because 

they didn't take place. 

 

Q: Is that the last time you spoke to Mr. Simpson? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: And is that one of the telephone conversations that you had with Mr. 

Simpson while he was in jail? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: And you were here in Kansas City? 

 

A; Yes 

 

Q: Did your discussion about writing an article in response to the Time 

magazine piece take place in the same conversation about your 

testifying. 

 

A: No, it didn't. 

 

Q: And which one occurred first? 

 

A:I think the article. 

 

Q: Can you tell me about the article that Mr. Simpson wanted you to 

write in opposition to ? 

 

A: Frankly, I didn't read the article. I just -- from what I understand, 

they just really colored him he felt like, I guess, in a really negative 

way. 

 

Q: Let me stop you right there for a moment. Everything you know 

about the article is based on what Mr. Simpson told you the articles 

reported? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: In other words, you didn't -- you didn't go out and independently 

read the article, right? 

 

A: No, I didn't. 

 

Q; And you hadn't read the article as of the time of the conversation 

with Mr. Simpson, right? 

 

A: Right. 

 

Q: Okay, so tell me what Mr. Simpson told you about the article as best 

as you can recall? 

 

A: It just said some negative things about him, and he wanted me 

obviously to contradict those things and they didn't take place. So, I 

think he was sort of disappointed and angered about that. 

 

Q: What negative things did Mr. Simpson tell you the article said about 

him that he wanted you to contradict? 

 

A: I can't remember honestly. 

 

Q. Generally speaking, what negative things had Mr. Simpson 

discussed with you? 

 

A. I can't remember. I just remember the conversation, but I can't 

remember details or anything in general. 

 

Q. Did it concern his relationship with Nicole? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: It's also asked and answered, : think.  

 

(By Mr. Petrocelli) You may answer.  

 

A: I don't remember. 

 

Q. In other words, did he say that the article said negative things about 

-- about his treatment of Nicole? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Asked and answered. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) You may answer. 

 

A. I didn't read the article, and he didn't -- excuse me. I don't remember 

what he had said. Remember, that's a couple of years ago, and I don't 

remember everything that has taken -- you know, that was said and has 

taken place.  

 

Q. Just so we are on the same wavelength, I realize. that you may not 

recall certain things, and if you recall anything, I'd like you to tell me. I 

appreciate that you won't have a complete recollection about things. 

 

A. That's fair. 

 

Q. Okay. But whatever it is that is in your mind and that you can recall 

that is responsive to my questions, tell me, because that's the best you 

can do. 

 

A. Right. 

 

Q. And I understand that. I don't want you to think, however, because 

you can't give me, you know, verbatim what was said that you 

shouldn't - 

 

A. Right. 

 

Q. -- you shouldn't testify. Just so we understand that. 

 

A. I am trying to do the best I can, but I can't remember the details of 

that or even -- you know, I just remember about the article, and he 

wanted me to write a letter that, you know, would contradict some 

negative things, and I can't remember those things, though. 

 

Q. Previously I thought you said that one of the reasons why you 

couldn't write the article that he requested was also because some of the 

things he wanted you to say were not true? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Misstates his testimony. Leading. 

 

(By Mr. Petrocelli) Is that what occurred also? 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: I agree. That mischaracterizes his testimony. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Did he ask you to write anything that in your 

view you could not write because it was not true? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. No. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) In other words, did he want you to write 

something in response to the Time magazine article that you in good 

conscience could not write because you did not think it happened that 

way? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. Arguing with him. 

 

A. I didn't read the article. So, I didn't - 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Simply based on your conversation with him. 

 

MR. LEONARD: Same objection. It's leading, argumentative. 

 

A. Once again, I didn't read the article, and I don't remember what he 

had articulated on the phone. So, you must understand once I decided 

not to do it, I really sort of didn't give it much thought afterwards. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Do you remember any of the things that he 

wanted you to say in the piece he asked you to write? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Mischaracterizes his testimony. 

Argumentative. Leading. 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Objection. Asked and answered. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) You may answer. 

 

A. I thought I already answered, if he said it was asked and answered. 

 

Q. Let's clarify something about objections, too. There isn't any judge 

here. At some point later on when we get to trial, a judge will rule on 

these objections, but right now, even though there are legal objections 

made by the lawyers, you still have to answer the question as though 

the objection were never made unless your lawyer tells you not to 

answer. 

 

A. Okay. 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: You have asked this question several times, Dan. 

That's all. I just wanted to bring up that point and hope that you'll be 

moving on soon. 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, in my view, those are not meritorious 

objections. So, I am just going to have to continue the examination and 

a judge will have to deal with that issue. 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: I understand. And there will come a point perhaps 

when it become overly burdensome or harassing. I am not saying we 

are there yet, but that's what I will be on the lookout for. 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Can you read the last question, please? 

 

(Whereupon, the pending question was read back by the Reporter as 

follows:) 

 

QUESTION: "Do you remember any of the things that he wanted you 

to say in the piece he asked you to write?" 

 

MR. LEONARD: Same objections. 

 

A. No, I don't. 

 

(By Mr. Petrocelli) As you sit here today, you cannot recall a single 

thing that he mentioned to you about the Time magazine article; is that 

true? 

 

A. That's true. 

 

Q. And you cannot recall a single thing that he wanted you to write in 

response to the article? 

 

MR. LEONMD: Objection. Argumentative. Leading. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) True? 

 

A. That's true.  

 

Q: You testified that there was a second conversation with Mr. 

Simpson in which he asked you to -- whether you would be willing to 

come testify on his behalf at the criminal trial. 

 

A: Yes, I did. 

 

Q: And you told him that you would not do so, correct? 

 

A: Correct. 

 

Q: And the reason you told him you would not do so was because what 

he wanted you to say was not true, correct? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative. Leading. 

 

Q: (By Mr. Petrocelli) Correct? 

 

A: True. 

 

Q: And tell me what Mr. Simpson told you that he wanted you to say at 

the trial that you could not say because it was true, correct? 

 

A: Yes, I did. 

 

Q: And the reason you told him you would not do so was because what 

he wanted you to say was not true, correct? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative. Leading. 

 

Q. ( By Mr. Petrocelli): Correct? 

 

A: True. 

 

Q: And tell me what Mr. Simpson told you that he wanted you to say at 

the trial that you could not say because it was not true? 

 

A: That Nicole and I had had an affair, and that he knew about it, and 

that he didn't get upset. First of all, we didn't have an affair, so I could 

not -- 

 

Q: But before you get to that part of it, I want you to complete your 

answer unless you had already completed it. 

 

A: I had completed it. 

 

Q: You said that Mr. Simpson wanted you to say that Nicole and you 

had had an affair, right? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative. Misstates his testimony. 

Leading. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Correct? 

 

A: That's what I said. 

 

Q. And that he, Mr. Simpson, knew about it, correct? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q): And that he was not upset, correct? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Same objections 

 

A: Correct 

 

Q: (By Mr. Petrocelli) And that's when you stopped. Was there 

anything more he wanted you to testify about? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. Argumentative. 

 

A: No, there wasn't. 

 

MR SCHEPERS: You have to wait until he finishes his objection. 

 

A: I am sorry, I realize that now. 

 

Q: (By Mr. Petrocelli) Did Mr. Simpson say to you in this conversation 

anything about when this affair took place? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading  

 

A: Excuse me. I am sorry. No, he did not. 

 

Q: (By Mr. Petrocelli) When Mr. Simpson mentioned this alleged affair 

to you, did you have any idea what he was talking about? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading  

 

A: No, I was sort of surprised. 

 

Q: (By Mr. Petrocelli) Was this conversation about an affair between 

Nicole and you that you had with Mr. Simpson from the jail cell the 

very first time in your life that you had ever spoken to him about an 

affair between you and Nicole? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading  

 

A: No, it wasn't. 

 

Q: (Mr. Petrocelli) So, there had been a prior occasion when this 

subject came up, right? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: And that was prior to Nicole's death? 

 

A: Yes, it was. 

 

Q: Do you recall the date of that conversation?  

 

A: No, I don't recall. 

 

Q: Do you recall the timing of it, generally? 

 

A: I don't know. Maybe May of -- I think I was in my tour, my -- I was 

a free agent at the time, and I was traveling around trying to decide 

who I was going to play for, and I don't remember specifically, but I 

was in New York, and I got -- I was visiting Mark Packar, and I 

received -- well, he received a call. 

 

Q: Mr. Packer? 

 

A: Yes. And they had a conversation and then he gave me the phone, 

and I said hello, and he says, "Nicole told me everything." You know, 

"Just" -- you know "Just don't say anything." And I was sort of 

surprised and I gave Packar back the phone, and I think on my -- upon 

return I may have went to his house to find out what exactly, you 

know, he was talking about transpired, and I said, 'I am sorry. Nothing 

happened.' And that's the two times that we had those discussions and 

didn't have any after that. 

 

Q: This conversation that you just recounted -- actually, you just 

recounted two prior conversations. 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: One while you were at Mark Packar's house in New York, right? 

 

A: Yes 

 

Q: And the second conversation when you saw Mr. Simpson at 

Rockingham? 

 

A: Yes. I went to his home in Rockingham. 

 

Q: Right. Focusing first in the conversation when you were in Packar's 

home. 

 

A: Yes. It was a very short conversation, and as I said before, he just 

said, "Nicole told me everything. Just keep it between you and me." 

And I -- 

 

Q: Is that all he said? 

 

A: That was it. 

 

Q: Did he say anything more to you to indicate what he was talking 

about was an affair or a sexual relationship between you and Nicole? 

 

A: No, he did not. 

 

Q: did Mr. Simpson in that conversation say to you in words or in 

substance the following: "Marcus, do me a favor and ease up on 

Nicole? 

 

A: No, he did not. I don't remember that. 

 

Q; Did Mr. Simpson say to you in that telephone conversation, 

"Because whatever is happening with you guys is really screwing her 

up. She is going like bonkers." 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading 

 

Q: (By Mr. Petrocelli) Did Mr. Simpson say that to you in that 

conversation? 

 

A: No, he did not. 

 

Q: Now, did the conversation that followed in Rockingham occur about 

one week later, Mr. Allen? 

 

A: Probably, yeah. 

 

Q: Did Mr. Simpson tell you in that conversation to back off? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading 

 

Q: No, he did not. 

 

A: (By Mr. Petrocelli) Was Mr. Simpson taking a nap when you 

arrived at his home? 

 

Q: Yes, I think he was. 

 

Q: Did you walk into his bedroom while he was sleeping? Or napping? 

 

A. I think he was up. I don't think he was napping. 

 

Q. Did the conversation take place in Mr. Simpson's bedroom -- 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q: -- in Rockingham? 

 

A: Yes. 

 

Q: Was this during a time when Nicole was no longer living there, 

right? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Did you apologize to Mr. Simpson in this conversation? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague and leading.  

 

A: Yes. I said, "I am sorry. Nothing happened. 

 

Q: (By Mr. Petrocelli) Did you apologize to Mr. Simpson for having 

had an affair with Nicole? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. No, I did not. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Did you -- in either of these two conversations, 

the phone conversation at Packar's house and the bedroom conversation 

at Rockingham, did you acknowledge to Mr. Simpson that you had had 

an affair with Nicole? 

 

A. No. 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. No, I did not. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Did you explain to Mr. Simpson anything by 

which he might have misconstrued that you were having an affair with 

Nicole? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague and leading. 

 

A. No. I said, "No, nothing happened." 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Did you and he discuss in either of these two 

conversations that you had been visiting Nicole?  

 

A: I don't remember that.  

 

Q: Or spending any time with her. 

 

A: No. I don't think so.  

 

Q: Or going out with her? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. 

 

A. No. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Anything like that come up? 

 

A. No. 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague, leading. 

 

A. No. 

 

MR. KELLY: I just want him to wait until the objection is completed 

before the answer comes out. 

 

Q: (By Mr. Petrocelli) Please. 

 

A. I don't realize he is objecting all the time. I trying -- you know, he 

comes right in. 

 

MR. KELLY: Mr. Leonard, would you stop objecting? 

 

MR. LEONARD: I don't think so. 

 

A. I will pause. 

 

MR. LEONARD: That would be a good idea if you would just pause a 

little bit. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Did you ever discuss this conversation or these 

two conversations that you had with Mr. Simpson when he was in jail 

the one time you visited him? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading.  

 

A: Yes. That's the one that I - I said - 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: I think he is talking about an actual visit. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) I am sorry. When you personally visited him in 

jail as opposed to the phone calls. 

 

A. No. I am sorry. No. 

 

Q. It didn't come up in the jail visit, right? 

 

A. No, it did not. 

 

Q. And after you had these two conversations with Mr. Simpson, did 

you ever speak with him again on that subject at any time up until this 

telephone call? 

 

A. No, I did not. 

 

Q. Now, did you have a conversation with Mr. Cowlings at Wayne 

Hughes' home about a week or two after Nicole's death? 

 

A. Yes, I did. 

 

Q. And in that conversation, did Mr. Cowlings bring up the subject of 

your having had an affair with Nicole? 

 

A. Yes, he did. 

 

Q. And did he tell you that -- that the reason he was bringing it up was 

because he wanted you to be able to tell your wife before she heard 

about in the press? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

A: Yes . 

 

Q: (By Mr. Petrocelli) And what did you say to Mr. Cowlings when he 

said that to you? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. Leading 

 

A. I don't remember saying anything to A.C. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Did you acknowledge having had an affair with 

Nicole? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. 

 

A. No, I did not. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Did you deny having had an affair with Nicole? 

 

MR. KELLY: I am sorry, Dan. Once again, we are getting the answers 

and objections at the same time. I want to make sure the record is clear. 

so, somebody has got to rein it in. 

 

MR. LEONARD: If you could pause after the question, it would be 

very helpful.  

 

Q: (By Mr. Petrocelli) Did you deny having had an affair with Nicole? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. I don't remember saying anything to A.C. 

 

Q: (By Mr. Petrocelli) To the best of your recollection, what did A.C. 

say to you? 

 

A: It was sort of I guess exactly what you had said. 

 

Q. Did Mr. Cowlings say to you in this conversation at Wayne Hughes' 

home that he knew about your sexual relationship with Nicole? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

A: No, he did not. 

 

Q: (By Mr. Petrocelli) Did he tell you that there was a strong 

possibility that Nicole's friends knew about the relationship? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. No, he did not. 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: I'll talk to you about that later. I don't have any 

more questions about that now any way. Okay. 

 

Q. Have you had any other conversations with Mr. Cowlings after that 

one concerning the same subject? 

 

A: No. 

 

Q: Have you at any time spoken to anyone else about this subject? And 

by this subject, I mean this alleged affair between Nicole and you. 

 

A: Not that I recall. 

 

Q: You have spoken to Mr. Simpson about it, as you have already 

testified? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And you have spoken to Mr. Cowlings about it on that one 

occasion? 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: I believe that mischaracterizes his testimony. He 

didn't say anything. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Well, he spoke to you about it? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. What I mean is a conversation in which you were either speaking to 

someone in person or by phone in which the topic came up. That's what 

I am referring to. Okay? And the only times you are saying this topic 

ever came up in a conversation in which you are a participant was the 

ones that you described already with Mr. Simpson? 

 

A. I think so. To the best of my ability, I think that's the only two calls 

that I -- the only two times that I talked about that. 

 

Q. And the one time with Mr. Cowlings? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And nobody else? 

 

A. To the best of my ability, I think, no one else. 

 

Q. Did you ever discuss this topic with any of Mr. Simpson's and your 

mutual friends? 

 

A. I don't think so. 

 

Q. Such as Mr. Hughes7 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. I don't think so. I can't recall. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) I would like to see if I can pin down a little bit 

the timing of your conversations with Mr. Simpson before Nicole's 

death concerning this alleged affair between Nicole and you, the 

conversation at the Packar residence and then at Mr. Simpson's 

residence. Okay? You said this was at a time when you were looking 

for employment? 

 

A. Yes. I think it was in '93. 

 

Q. '93? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. May of '93 would be the best of your recollection? 

 

A. I think so. I think that's when I started taking my trips. I am not sure, 

but I think it was definitely May because I decided to play for the 

Chiefs, and that was my first year. So -- 

 

Q. Now, let's go back to your telephone call with Mr. Simpson when he 

asked you to testify for him. You told Mr. Simpson that is was untrue 

that you and Nicole had had an affair? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. I told him nothing happened. 

 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Now, we are back to the telephone call now 

when he was in jail and you were in Kansas City and he asked you to 

testify, just so you will understand the point of reference here. 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading.  

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Do you understand that?  

 

A. No. Would you repeat that again, please? 

 

Q. I am now going to return to the telephone call that you had with Mr. 

Simpson when he called you while he was in jail and you were in 

Kansas City and he asked you to testify about this affair with Nicole. 

 

A. Right. 

 

Q. And you told -- you previously testified that Mr. Simpson had asked 

you to say under oath in court -- 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. -- that he and -- that you and Nicole had had an affair, and that he 

knew about it, and that he was not upset? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. Argumentative. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Do you recall that? 

 

A. I do recall that, and I -- 

 

Q. What did he tell him in that conversation after he said that to you? 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Objection. Asked and answered. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) You may answer. 

 

A. That it didn't happen I think is what I said. 

 

Q. In the telephone conversation? 

 

A. I think so, yes. 

 

Q. What did he say? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. 

 

A. I think he got -- I think he wee a little bit upset, and I can't 

remember exactly what he said after that, but it was -- you could tell 

that he was a little bit angry, disappointed. And, you know, frankly I 

don't know what she told him, but that was not the case. 

 

MR. LEONARD: I am going to move to strike as non-responsive. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Can you tell me generally what he said to you in 

response to your statement that it never happened? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. Leading. 

 

A. No, I can't. I can't generally say what he exactly said. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Did he tell you why he believed that it 

happened? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. No, he did not. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Did he tell you how he knew it had happened? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading.  

 

A. No, sir, he didn't.  

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Did he accuse you of just trying to protect your 

own interests at his expense? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Or in substance did he accuse you of that? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. Argumentative. 

 

A. No, I don't. 

 

Q. ( By Mr. Petrocelli) Did he remind you of the telephone 

conversations you had had the year before -- excuse me. Did he remind 

you of the two conversations that you had had the year before? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading.  

 

A. I don't think he did. I am not sure.  

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Did he say, for example, don't you remember, 

we spoke about it last year at Packar's, and then you came back to my 

house and you apologized and you acknowledged it, did he say 

anything like that to you in this conversation? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. Compound. Lack of foundation. 

 

A. He may have. I frankly can't remember though. 

 

MR. LEONARD: Move to strike. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Have you made any notes of that conversation? 

 

A. No, I didn't. 

 

Q. And did you tell anyone about that conversation after it occurred? 

 

A. I don't think I did, no. I can't remember if I did. 

 

Q. Did you speak to any of Mr. Simpson's lawyers during the criminal 

trial? At any time after his arrest, were you contacted by any of Mr. 

Simpson's lawyers or representatives? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Compound. 

 

A. I think twice. One I think was early in his incarceration. I think he 

just got a group of his friends together, of his supporters, and they had 

a phone call, and much like the surrounding we have here, it was a 

speaker phone, and he called collect and we all just lended our support, 

and we had something -- you know, something positive to say to him, 

hang in there and so on, and the second one was, I think, with Mr. -- 

Mr. Cochran, and I think that conversation was basically that I couldn't, 

I think, write the letter or -- I think that was it. I am not sure. 

 

MR. LEONARD: I am going to move to strike as non-responsive and 

speculative. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Mr. Cochran called you or you called him? 

 

A. I am not sure. I am not sure how that happened. 

 

Q. Was it a telephone call? 

 

A. Yes, it was. 

 

Q. Were you in Kansas City at that time? 

 

A. Yes. So, maybe I called him. I am not sure. I don't know. 

 

Q. And did -- withdrawn. Mr. Cochran --  

 

A. Maybe it was a return call. I am not sure. I can't remember. 

 

Q. Mr. Cochran asked you if you would write an article in opposition 

of the Time magazine article? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Mischaracterizes his testimony. Leading. 

Argumentative. 

 

A. I think so. I am not sure, sir. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Did this call occur after the one with Mr. 

Simpson when he had first broached the subject with you? 

 

A. I think so. 

 

Q. And what did you tell Mr. Cochran? 

 

A. The same thing that I told Mr. Simpson.  

 

Q. And what was that?  

 

A. That I don't think I can do that.  

 

Q. And did you give a reason why? 

 

A. No, I didn't. 

 

Q. What was the reason why you couldn't do it? 

 

A. Frankly, I just -- you know, I sort of regret not being more of a 

staunch supporter, but it was such a circus that I just didn't want to get 

involved in it, to be honest with you. 

 

Q. And did it have anything to do with the fact that some of the things 

that they wanted you to say were not true? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. Argumentative. Lack of 

foundation. 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Are you talking about the conversation with --  

 

A. I told you about the article. I don't remember about that, yeah. That 

conversation.  

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) But we are now talking about the Cochran call, 

and I am asking whether in the context of this Cochran call one of your 

mental thoughts or processes was that you were not going to write this 

letter because some of the stuff that he -- they wanted you to say was 

not true? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Compound. Leading. Argumentative. 

Lack of foundation. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) You may answer. 

 

A. Once again, I don't remember generally what they -- what the article 

said or what they wanted me to write. 

 

Q. So, the only reason that you can recall right now why you did not 

agree to write anything was because you did not want to get involved; 

is that true? 

 

A. The way things were going, right. 

 

Q. Is that the only time you spoke to Mr. Cochran? 

 

A. I think so. 

 

Q. Now, the other incident in which you spoke with Mr. Simpson's 

lawyers was at a meeting? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. That was at Mr. Shapiro's office? 

 

A. I assume it was his office, yes. 

 

Q. It was in Century City? 

 

A. Century City. Yes. 

 

Q. And that was shortly after Mr. Simpson's arrest? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Before you had left for Kansas City, right? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And there were a lot of his friends and supporters around the table? 

 

A. Yes . 

 

Q. And he called in from the jail cell and he was on the speaker phone? 

 

A. Yes . 

 

Q. And the purpose of that meeting was to -- 

 

A. I don't know. 

 

Q. -- enlist people's support? 

 

A. Yes. I think so. 

 

Q. And Mr. Shapiro told everyone at the meeting not to talk to anyone? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. foundation. Leading. Lack of foundation. 

 

A. I can't remember. I remember he did say that we were just 

assembling the best guys that we can, and we are going to do -- you 

know, we really feel confident, we are going to do what we can to free 

him. That's -- and once again, everybody sort of said something, took 

their turn going around the table showing signs of support. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) You were there with your wife Kathryn? 

 

A. Yes . 

 

Q. Do you remember the other people who were there? 

 

A. Not everyone. 

 

Q. Tell me who you can remember. 

 

A. I remember Mr. Hughes being there. 

 

Q. Mr. Hughes? 

 

A. Mr. Hughes. Schwartz. I think Mr. Austin. I can't remember the 

other people. 

 

Q. Who invited you to the meeting? 

 

A. I am not sure. I don't know how -- who contacted us. 

 

Q. Are those the only times when you had any contact with Mr. 

Simpson's lawyers or representatives following his arrest? 

 

A. Yes. I think so. 

 

Q. And have any of the lawyers who represented him in the criminal 

trial contacted you since his release from jail?  

 

A. No, they haven't. 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Is this a good time to take a quick break? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah. This is a good time. 

 

VIDEO TECHNICIAN: please stand by. Going off the record. It is

VIDEO TECHNIC1AN: We are back on the record. It is 10:44. I 

would like to make a correction. I said when we went off record, and it 

was 10. Please continue. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Mr. Allen, prior to Nicole's death on June 12, 

you had come to become friends with some of her friends? 

 

A. I wouldn't say friends. 

 

Q. For example, Cora Fischman. 

  

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Focusing on the time period prior to June 12th for these series of 

questions, were you friends with Cora Fischman? 

 

A. I wouldn't say friends. 

 

Q. Acquaintances? 

 

A. I mean acquaintances, yes. 

 

Q. And with Faye Resnick? 

 

A. I would say acquaintances. 

 

Q. CiCi Shahian? 

 

A. Frankly, I really don't remember her. 

 

Q. Chris Jenner? 

  

A. I had known Chris for awhile, yes. 

 

Q. You would call her a friend? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Pam Schwartz? 

  

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And Robin Greer? 

  

A. Yes. I associated basically. 

 

Q. Now, Mr. Simpson and Nicole got divorced some time in January of 

'92. You are aware of that, right? 

  

A. I guess. I am not sure when. 

 

Q. You are not sure of the time frame? 

  

A. Yes. 

 

Q. But you know they got divorced, right? 

 

A. Yes. I am. 

 

Q. And after Mr. Simpson and Nicole's divorce, did you ever socialize 

with Nicole without Mr. Simpson being present? 

 

A. Not immediately, no. 

 

Q. Did there come a time when you did? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. When was that? 

 

A. I am not sure. I mean -- 

 

Q. Was it while Nicole was living at the Gretna Green condominium? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And how often did you socialize with her during the time she lived 

at Gretna Green? 

 

A. I went by on occasion. There were people present, though. 

Q. Were you ever with Nicole alone? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. I may have been, yes. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Did the two of you ever go out on a date? 

 

A. No, we hadn't. 

 

Q. When you were with her alone, you were -- what were the 

circumstances? 

 

MR. LEONARD: I object. 

 

A. I just stopped by and saw -- I am sorry.  

 

MR. LEONARD: Go ahead.  

 

A. -- and saying hello. That was about it.  

 

(By Mr. Petrocelli) You just -- is it fair to say you continued your 

friendship with her even though she was split up with O.J. Simpson, 

right? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And you would go visit her from time to time, right? 

 

A. Yes. On occasion, yes. 

 

Q. In 1992 and in 1993 where were you -- you were living in the 

Palisades home for part of that, and before the Palisades home, where 

were you residing? 

 

A. Montana residence. 

 

Q. Did Nicole ever visit you at your home in those years after she split 

up with Mr. Simpson? 

 

A. Yes. She stopped by, and I loaned her my car, and she dropped it 

off, and I took her back home.  

 

Q. That's the only time she ever stopped by? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Which place was that? 

 

A. The Palisades residence. Let me back up. Nicole also decorated my 

condominium on Montana, and that was in, I guess, early '82. So, I 

used to go over there to the design center and then did -- you know, did 

some work with her -- or she worked for me. 

 

Q. You owned that condominium on Montana? . 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Is that in Brentwood? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Do you still own it? 

 

A. Renting it out. 

 

Q. And Nicole helped you decorate it 1992, right? 

 

A. 1982. 

 

Q. 1982. 

 

A. Yes. I think that was it. 

 

Q. At any time thereafter did she help you from time to time remodel it 

or redecorate it? 

 

A. No, she didn't. 

 

Q. So, for example, during the 1990s, did she do anything with regard 

to the decoration of that condominium? 

 

A. No. She did not. No. 

 

Q. What kind of a car did you own in 1993? 

 

A. A black Mercedes. 

 

Q. And what was the license plate? 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Can we have one of these things deleted, this answer 

deleted, his license plate number? 

 

(By Mr. Petrocelli) Let me ask you this. Was it a personalized or 

stylized license plate? 

 

A. No. Regular. 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Then I don't care. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Do you remember it? 

 

A. No, I don't. 

 

Q. Okay. What model Mercedes was it?  

 

A. 560 SL. 

 

Q. What year was it? 

 

A. Excuse me. 560 S 

 

Q. El? 

 

A. No. SC -- No. I don't know what it is. The larger two-door.  

 

Q. The larger two-door model.  

 

A. Is it an SEC or something like that? Yeah. 

 

MR. KELLY: The two-seater?  

 

A. Yeah. The larger one. 

 

MR. KELLY: The 260? 

 

A. No. No. It's an '87. It's an older car. But what is it? SEC or 

something? 560 SEC? 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) I am not a Mercedes owner. 

 

A. I think that's it. 

 

Q. It's a two-seater? 

 

A. No. It's a four-seater but a two-door. 

 

Q. And that was a car that you had owned since 1987? 

 

A. I think so, yes. 

 

Q. And you still own it? 

 

A. Yes, I do. 

 

Q. And that's the car that you primarily used in 1993? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And when you visited Nicole at Gretna Green you would use that 

car? 

 

A. On occasion, yes. 

 

Q. What other cars did you drive during 1993? 

 

A. Testarosa Ferrari. 

 

Q. What color? 

 

A. Black. 

 

Q: Does that have a personalized or stylized license plate? 

 

A. No. 

 

Q. Were those the only two cars that you drove in 1993? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. In 1994, focusing on the time period from January through June 

12th when Nicole died, did you ever visit her at the Bundy 

condominium? 

 

A. Yes. When -- excuse me. When did they have the earthquake? 

 

Q. January 17, 1994. 

 

A. I think I saw her on the street, and she invited me over because I had 

never been to her place and stuff, her new place, and I think it was 

shortly after the earthquake -- I don't know exactly, but after that she 

mentioned she had some damage or something like that. 

 

Q. Now, when you say you saw her on the street, what do you mean by 

that? 

 

A. You know, she would jog, she would occasionally jog on San 

Vincente. I mean, everybody does. 

 

Q. And how did you happen to see her? You were driving on San 

Vincente? 

 

A. Yeah. That's one of the major arteries that everybody takes. 

 

Q. And you saw her, then, on this occasion? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. You then started talking to her and she would get in your car and 

you drove over to the Bundy condo? 

 

A. Repeat that again, please? 

 

Q. Did she get in your car at that point and the two of you drove over 

to Bundy? 

 

A. No. No. 

 

Q. What happened? 

 

A. I am not quite sure. I just -- you know, I don't know how it 

happened. We just -- she invited me over there. I don't remember the 

circumstances. But she just said, come over some time, check out my 

new place. That's about it. 

 

Q. Did you come over that day?  

 

A. No. I don't think so.  

 

Q. And when did you go over?  

 

A. I don't remember. 

 

Q. Did you go over there alone? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And was anyone there with Nicole besides -- was anyone with her 

besides her? 

 

A. I think the maid and the kids. She had some lady cleaning her house 

or something like that. 

 

Q. Just visited for awhile? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And then you left? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Is that the only time you were ever at her Bundy condominium? 

 

A. I had been over there on more than one occasion. 

 

Q. What were the other occasions? 

 

A. Just stopping by to say hello. That's basically it. 

 

Q. When was the last time you visited Nicole at her Bundy 

condominium? 

 

A. I don't know. I don't recall. 

 

Q. How long before her death? 

 

A. I am not sure. It wasn't anywhere close to it, though. 

 

Q. Was it a matter of days? 

 

A. No. I don't think so. 

 

Q. Was it in the month of June? 

 

A. No. I don't think so. I am not sure. 

 

Q. Was it in the month of May, 1994? 

 

A. Perhaps. 

 

Q. Did you know when Nicole's birthday was? 

 

Q. No. I mean, I think we had been together, you know, a group of us 

on her birthday. But do I remember her birthday specifically? No. 

 

Q. Did you visit her for her birthday in May of 1994? 

 

A. I don't recall. 

 

Q. Did you give her a birthday present? 

 

A. No. 

 

Q. Was there a time when you visited her in May of 1994 when she 

was ill? 

 

A. I don't recall. 

 

Q. When she had pneumonia? 

 

A. I don't recall that. 

 

Q. What is your best recollection of the months when you visited 

Nicole in 1994 at her Bundy condominium after this first visit that you 

just described when you saw her jogging? 

 

A. I don't have a great recollection of that. I mean, it's almost two years 

ago. I don't remember that. 

 

Q. When was the last time you saw Nicole before her death? 

 

A. I can't recall that either. 

 

Q. Was it a matter of days, weeks or months? 

 

A. Well, it certainly had to be, I think, weeks, I think. 

 

Q. When was the last time you spoke with Nicole before her death? 

Same answer? 

 

A. I think I called Nicole on the phone, and she -- I think it was a 

couple of days prior to the 12th, and she said she was busy or call back, 

and I don't think I ever called back. 

 

Q. What day do you believe you called her? She died on Sunday 

evening, June 12th, if that helps you, the day that you left for the 

Caymans. 

 

A. I think maybe Friday. I am not sure, though. I am not sure. 

 

Q. Did she tell you what she was busy doing? 

 

A. Something with the kids or something like that. 

 

Q. Did she tell you about any plans she had to move? 

 

A. No, she did not. 

 

Q. At any time before her death in the last few months, did she mention 

that she was moving? 

 

A. She said she was looking for a home or something like that. But -- 

 

Q. Can you tell me anything that you and she talked about in this 

telephone call other than what you have just said? 

 

A. No. I told you she said that she was busy. Call her back. 

 

Q. A very short conversation? 

 

A. Very short. 

 

Q. That's the last time you spoke to her? 

 

A. Yes, it was. 

 

Q. Now, you said the last time you saw her was a matter of weeks 

before her death. Where was that? 

 

A. I think it was a matter of weeks. 

 

Q. And where did that take place where you saw her? 

 

A. I am not sure where, but I do remember seeing her. 

 

Q. Was it at her Bundy condominium? 

 

A. I don't -- I don't think so. 

 

Q. Did you go out with her? 

 

A. No. I may have seen her out. 

 

Q. You may have seen her jogging, you mean? 

 

A. I don't think it was jogging. I don't know if it was around the 

Brentwood/Westwood hole area or not. 

 

Q. Between January -- January and June of 1994, up to June 12 when 

Nicole was killed, did you go out to anyplace with her, such as a 

restaurant or a nightclub? 

 

A. I went out one night with a group of people to shoot pool with a 

group of people with them. 

 

Q. Who was in that group? 

 

A. The only other person I remember is Kato. I can't remember who 

else. 

 

Q. Do you think that this occurred -- withdrawn. How long before 

Nicole's death do you believe this occurred? 

 

A. I can't remember. 

 

Q. Was Nicole living at Bundy at the time? 

 

A. No. I think she was living at Gretna Green. 

 

Q. You went out with Nicole and Kato to shoot pool? 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Was there anyone else with you, with the three of you, I should say? 

 

A. I think there was a fourth but I am not sure who that person was. 

 

Q. Was that other person a woman who was accompanying Mr. 

Kaelin? 

 

A. I think it may have been a friend of Nicole's, but I am not quite sure 

who it was. 

 

Q. Was she with Mr. Kaelin as a date? 

 

A. There was no dating. 

 

Q. Among the four of you? 

 

A. It was just four friends going out. 

 

Q. Where did you shoot pool? 

 

A. A place called Gothic. I think, in Santa Monica. 

 

Q. Is that the only time that you were ever out in a restaurant or a place 

with Nicole without Mr. Simpson?  

 

A. Yes. My best recollection, yes. 

 

Q. Only that one occasion? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Your lawyer just showed you a note. 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: No. I was just trying to communicate to Mr. Allen to 

keep his answers 

responsive to the questions. That's all this says. 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: I think he is doing a good job of that. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) When you visited Nicole at Gretna Green, where 

did you park your car? 

 

A. Sometimes in front, sometimes on the side, depending on the 

parking. 

 

Q. Did you ever make an effort to park your car in a place where it 

would not be visible to someone driving by who knew your car? 

 

A. No.  

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. 

 

A. No, I did not. I'd park it in front. It was based on availability. If it 

wasn't I would park it on the side. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Going back to the times that you saw Nicole in 

1994, do you have any better recollection of where you and she were 

the last time you saw her which you though was a matter of weeks 

before her death? 

 

A. No, I don't. 

 

Q. Do you recall being with Nicole at anyplace other than her 

condominium between January and June of 1994? You also mentioned 

you saw her jogging that one time. 

 

A. No, I don't. 

 

Q. Did you ever have a romantic relationship with Nicole?  

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague. Leading. 

 

A. No, I did not. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Did Nicole and you, for example, ever kiss one 

another romantically? 

 

A. No, I did not. 

 

Q. So, no kind of sexual or romantic involvement did you ever have 

with her? 

 

A. None whatsoever. 

 

Q. Did she ever express to you romantic feelings that she had for you? 

 

A. No, she did not.  

 

Q. And did you ever express such feelings to her? 

 

A. No, I did not. 

 

Q. Your relationship with Nicole was purely one of friendship and 

nothing more? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. Yes, it was. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Did you make that clear to Mr. Simpson? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. Vague. 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: You can answer. 

 

A. Yes. I think he understood that. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Did you make that clear to Mr. Simpson when 

you spoke to him from the Packar residence? 

 

A. I didn't say anything at that particular time. 

 

Q. Did you make that clear to Mr. Simpson when you spoke to him in 

his bedroom at Rockingham? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. Leading, argumentative. Lack of 

foundation. 

 

MR. SCHEPPERS: You can answer. 

 

A. I think he understood that. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Based on what you said? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And did you make that clear to Mr. Simpson once again in this last 

telephone call that you and he had? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague, leading, argumentative, lack of 

foundation. 

 

A. No, I did not. 

 

MR. LEONARD: Calls for speculation. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) In other words, did you express to Mr. Simpson 

in no uncertain terms that you have never had a romantic relationship 

with Nicole. 

 

A. Yes. 

 

MR. LEOMARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. Excuse me. I am sorry. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) You may answer. 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Answer again. 

 

A. Yes. 

 

MR. LEONARD: Same objections. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Now, you knew that -- withdrawn. Did you 

become aware that some time after Nicole and Mr. Simpson split up 

that they attempted a reconciliation?  

 

A. Yes.  

 

Q. And did you learn that from Mr. Simpson?  

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And also from Nicole? 

 

A. No. 

 

Q. Did you ever discuss with Nicole her getting back with Mr. 

Simpson? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. What did she say to you about that? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: As best you can recall. 

 

A. That they were trying to get back together, and I sort of, you know, 

encouraged it. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Did she tell you why they were trying to get 

back together? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. No, she did not. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) And when did this occur? 

 

A. I can't pinpoint a time, sir.  

 

Q. Did you talk to Mr. Simpson about Nicole and he getting back 

together? 

 

A. Just briefly. I can't remember when. 

 

Q. What did Mr. Simpson say? 

 

A. That they were just trying to get back together. 

 

Q. And did he tell you why? 

 

A. No, he did not. 

 

Q. Did he tell you whose idea it was? 

 

A. No, he did not. I don't recall that. 

 

Q. Did you speak to Mr. Simpson from time to time in the period of 

time in which he was attempting his reconciliation with Nicole? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Did he talk to you about her from time to time during that period? 

 

A. No, he did not. We played golf together and so on. 

 

Q. Did he tell you about any problems that they were having? 

 

A. No, he did not. 

 

Q. Did you know about this incident in October of 1993 when Nicole 

and he fought resulting in a 911 call? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Compound. Leading. 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: October, '93? 

 

A. No, I did not. I didn't know about that. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Is the first time that you heard about that when it 

came out in the news and the trial occurred? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. Yes. 

 

(By Mr. Petrocelli) So, Mr. Simpson never told you that that occurred; 

is that right? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) That is right? Mr. Simpson never told you -- 

 

A. He never told me. That's what I am saying. 

 

Q. Okay. And no one else ever told you, true? 

 

A. True. 

 

Q. Did there come a time when you learned that this attempted 

reconciliation between Mr. Simpson and Nicole was over? 

 

A. I had heard about it later, but, no, nobody informed me. 

 

Q. You played golf with Mr. Simpson on June 7 at Riviera, right?  

 

A. I guess. 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: '94? 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) 1994. 

 

A. I played golf with him quite a bit. I am not sure whether it was June 

7th or not. 

 

Q. The last time you played golf with Mr. Simpson was the week 

before Nicole's murder, correct? 

 

A. I guess. I am not sure. I mean, I -- 

 

Q. Do you recall playing golf with Mr. Simpson, Allen Austin and Joe 

Kolkowitz at Riviera on June 7, 1994? 

 

A. No, I don't, sir. I mean, I played golf with him several times. What I 

am saying is, I don't know that -- any specific date. 

 

Q. Do you recall the last time you played golf with Mr. Simpson before 

Nicole's death? 

 

A. It may have been at the Riviera. I am not sure. We played so often 

it's sort of hard for me to say when.  

 

Q. Do you recall Mr. Simpson telling you at golf shortly before 

Nicole's death that it was over between Nicole and him? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. I don't remember him saying that. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) After you played golf with Mr. Simpson, you 

would typically have lunch at the club? 

 

A. Occasionally. 

 

Q. Do you recall Mr. Simpson telling you that at lunch? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) In the week before Nicole's death. 

 

A. I don't remember him saying that. 

 

Q. Did you have any knowledge or information prior to Nicole's death 

that she had ended her reconciliation attempt with Mr. Simpson? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. 

 

A. No, I didn't. 

 

MR. LEONARD: Calls for speculation. Lack of foundation. 

 

A. Sorry about that. No. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) As of June 12, 1994, you believed that they were 

still trying to work things out? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Did you come to learn at any time before June 12 that Nicole was 

planning to move back in to Rockingham? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. Calls for speculation. 

 

A. No. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Nicole was a close friend of yours as of the time 

that she was killed, right? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. At any time during Mr. Simpson's relationship with Nicole, did you 

ever come to learn of any physical abuse of her at the hands of Mr. 

Simpson? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. No. Other than the -- the obvious one that -- you know, that came 

out later. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) And what are you referring to, Mr. Allen? 

 

A. The -- you know, the incident in, I don't know, '89 or something. I 

am not sure. 

 

Q: And when did you become aware of the incident in 1989? 

 

A. Later that evening. Or, excuse me. Early morning. 

 

Q. And describe to me the circumstances of how you became aware of 

this incident. 

 

A. The four of us went out to a New Year's Eve party. 

 

Q. At Peter Locks? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And the four of you being whom? 

 

A. O.J. and Nicole and Kathryn and myself. And we went out and had 

a wonderful time, and then we departed, and I think I received a call 

early in the morning. 

 

Q. About what time? 

 

A. I am not sure, sir. I am really not sure. 

 

Q. Where were you living? 

 

A. On Montana. 

 

Q. Was Kathryn living with you at that time? 

 

A. I think so. 

 

Q. Continue. 

 

A. Yes, she was. It was A.C. calling and trying to find the whereabouts 

of O.J., and then he had told me what happened. And that was it. 

 

Q. Before that call from Mr. Cowlings, had you received a call from 

Nicole or Mr. Simpson? 

 

A. No. 

 

Q. Had Kathryn received the call from Mr. Simpson or Nicole, to your 

knowledge? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Call. for speculation. Lack of foundation. 

 

A. I don't think so. I mean, we were together, and I don't think we 

received a call. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Until Mr. Cowling called? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And what did Mr. Cowlings tell you when he called? 

 

A. He just said -- you know, he was excited and he said, "Where the 

hell is O.J.? He just got into an argument with Nicole and the police are 

up here," that sort of thing. 

 

Q. When Mr. Cowlings called, you understood he was at Rockingham? 

 

A. No. I didn't know where he was. 

 

Q. He said the police are up here.  

 

A. Yeah. Oh, I guess -- yeah. I guess so. I didn't know where he was at 

the time but when he said up here, I mean I really wasn't cognizant that 

early in the morning of what had transpired, but I do remember him 

calling and saying, you know, "Where is O.J.? He got into an argument 

and the police are up here." At that particular time I wasn't cognizant of 

what he said, I mean, completely understood. But -- 

 

Q. Mr. Cowlings appeared upset to you? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And what did he say, if anything, about what had transpired? 

 

A. He didn't go into any details. 

 

Q. Did he tell you that Nicole had been hit? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) You may answer. 

 

A. He didn't go into any details. I mean, after he -- I said no I guess he,

wanted to play golf. I don't know which day it was, but he already had 

his foursome or something like that. So -- 

Q. Did you make contact with him?  

 

A. Yeah. I gave him a call. And can you tell me anything about that 

call other than what you have just said? Well he was on the other line. 

 

Q. Excuse me? 

 

A. He was on the other line. 

 

Q. Yeah. 

 

A. So, I asked him and he said he already got his foursome, so -- that 

he was on another line so he had -- you know he would have to get 

back to me. 

 

Q. Was this a call so you could play golf Sunday morning? 

 

A. I think. I am not sure.

A. We went out to look at some Hummers and we were at the -- I think 

the Sagebrush Cantina, or something like that, after that. 

 

Q. Did you pick Mr. Cowlings up?

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Or Callabasis? 

 

A. Yes. Somewhere in the valley. 

 

Q. How did you find out about Nicole's death? 

 

A. We were playing golf, and one of the people that worked at the 

hotel came out on the golf course and said I had an important phone 

call from -- from my sister-in-law Debbie. So, right away I thought 

there was something, you know, wrong with the house or something 

like that. So, I left the course and went to the office and grabbed the 

phone, and she told me -- 

 

Q. Who is she?  

 

A. Debbie Cornell. 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Can we have that name out of the -- 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: It's already in. 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Publicly -- well, okay. If it' already out there, that's 

all right.  

 

A. That Nicole had been killed -- or Nicole was dead or something like 

that. And I said, "Oh, my god." And immediately I thought maybe that 

she was in a car accident or something like that. And then she went on 

to say that, "And they think O.J. did it." And I mean, at that point, you 

know, I was in total shock. 

 

So, I went out and I was playing golf with I think Tim Brown and 

Michael Warrenstein, and I told those guys, and we immediately 

stopped golfing and we went -- I went in search of my wife. And then I 

informed her. And I think I went to the room and, you know, we cried 

to, you know, just call people to find out what the hell happened, 

what's going on. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Did you speak to Mr. Simpson that day? 

 

A. I think it was that evening. Or the next day -- 

 

Q. How did you get -- 

 

A. -- I think it was. Excuse me. I think it was the next day. 

 

Q. How did you get in touch with him? You called him? 

  

A. Called his house. 

 

Q. And what did you say to him and what did he say to you? 

 

A. You know, first of all, I said, You know, "How are you doing? Are 

you all right?" And he says that he -- I think he said he couldn't even 

grieve because they are accusing him. And I think that was -- frankly I 

don't know what I said after that. And I think my wife took the phone, 

and I think she said that she, you know, would help out with the kids, 

or something to that nature, and that was basically it because he 

sounded really despondent. So -- I mean, you don't -- you are in shock. 

You don't know what else to say, and the conversation was basically 

short. 

 

Q. Did you ask him why he was being accused? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. No. I mean, at that particular time, you know, you -- I don't know 

what -- you know, I don't know what was going on. I just wanted to 

know if he was okay, and I wasn't thinking about anything else. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Is that the conversation? 

 

A. Yes . 

 

Q. Now, at any time that week before his arrest, did you ever have any 

other conversations with him? 

 

A. No. That was it. 

 

Q. That's the last time you spoke to him? 

 

A. I think so. I think we tried to call him at the Kardashians', and 

somebody said that he couldn't speak, and that was it. 

 

Q. And did you speak to Mr. Cowlings that week from time to time? 

 

A. Yes . 

 

Q. Did you learn from Mr. Cowlings why Mr. Simpson was being 

charged or accused of these crimes? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. Calls for speculation, 

leading and it's compound. 

 

A. Well, frankly the people that I tried to contact were in shock as well 

and didn't know what was going on. CNN was the -- you know, what 

we sort of relied on. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Seeing what? 

 

A. CNN. 

 

Q. Oh, CNN. You mean the news coverage? 

 

A. Yes. That's what we sort of watched, because everybody was -- we 

called and -- I don't know. We called a ton of people and nobody knew 

what was going on, and nobody could believe it. And, you know, it was 

-- we just sort of got our information from CNN. 

 

Q. Did you discuss with Mr. Cowlings at any time where Mr. Simpson 

was at the time that Nicole was killed? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. No, sir. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Did you discuss with Mr. Cowlings what was 

the basis for the charges or accusations that Mr. Simpson was 

responsible for Nicole's death? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. Compound. No, sir. I didn't have 

to because it was all right there on television. I mean, that was it. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) Now, you did not come back for Nicole's 

funeral, right? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And what was your reason for that? 

 

A. Well, frankly, I was out of the country, and I have some regrets 

about not coming back, but unfortunately she was -- she was gone and 

there was really nothing that could be done, and all we did was sort of 

pray for the family, and that's when I eventually -- as time went by, I 

felt bad about it, and I called Judy Brown and gave her my 

condolences, because I was -- frankly I was in shock still. 

 

Q. Did you have a conversation with Mr. Simpson in which he told you 

that you should not come back? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. Lack of foundation. Calls for 

speculation. 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) And when did that occur? 

 

A. That was during the conversation that we called to find out was he 

okay. Now that you brought that to my attention, that's when I said, 

"Do you want me to come back," and he said no. 

 

Q. You gave a statement to the police at some point in time? 

 

A. Yes, I did. 

 

Q. You were interviewed by Detectives Luper and Stephens and 

Deputy District Attorney Chris Darden? 

 

A. Yes, I was. 

 

Q. And that was here in Kansas City, right? 

 

A. Yes, it was. 

 

Q. And is everything that you told the police and Mr. Darden during 

that interview true? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Compound.  

 

A. Yes, it is, sir. Sorry again. 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: I would like to get some copies made. I would 

like to attach to the record a copy of that interview. 

 

MR. BELLEMERE: Do you need to get copies before that or do you 

want to do something else first? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. We will mark that as an exhibit now. 

 

MR. BELLEMERE: Do You want to mark it before I copy it? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah. That's a good idea. Can you mark this as 

Allen Exhibit No. 1?

VIDEO TECHNICIAN Excuse me. Let's have the mike, please 

 

(By Mr. Brewer) Referencing the phone conversation at the Packar 

residence that you had with Mr. Simpson, you indicated that he told 

you that Nicole had told him about your alleged relationship. Is that 

true? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Did you ever ask Nicole about that, whether she had ever said 

anything to Mr. Simpson about a relationship you allegedly had with 

her?  

 

MR. LEONARD Objection. Leading. 

 

A. Yes. But she said she didn't want to talk about it 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) She didn't want to talk about it with you? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. When did you have a discussion with Nicole about that? 

 

A. I am not quite sure when I called her, but I called to find out what 

was going on, and she sort of avoided the issue. 

 

Q. Was it shortly after you had spoken with Mr. Simpson? 

 

A. It wasn't immediate, but it was -- yes. 

 

Q. Because you wanted to find out what was going on? 

 

A. Right. 

 

Q. And you more or less confronted Nicole about this? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

MR. LEONARD Objection. Leading. 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) Because you believed Mr. Simpson when he told 

you that Nicole had claimed this relationship existed, true? 

 

A. Repeat that again, please 

 

Q. You believed Mr. Simpson when he made this statement to you 

about Nicole telling about a relationship or an alleged relationship that 

you and she had; is that correct? That's why you called Nicole? 

 

A. Yeah I wanted to find out what was going on.  

 

Q. What did you say to her exactly when you spoke with her? 

 

A. What did I say to her? 

 

Q. Yes. 

 

A. I said, "Nic, what's happening? What's going on?" That's exactly 

what I said. 

 

Q. Do you know where she was when you spoke with her? 

 

A. She may have been home. 

 

Q. At what residence? Gretna Green? 

 

A. I am not sure, to be honest with you. 

 

Q. Did you talk about anything else in that telephone conversation? 

 

A. No. She was pretty short. 

 

Q. Okay. And, so, you just said, "Nic," you know, "'what's happening," 

referencing this conversation, and she didn't want to talk about it? 

 

MR LEONARD Objection. Leading. 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) Did you press her about this alleged statement that 

she made to Mr. Simpson about your relationship? 

 

MR. LEONARD Objection. Leading.  

 

A. She was short. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) Did you press her about why or whether she even 

told this to Mr. Simpson? 

 

MR. LEONARD Objection. Compound, argumentative, leading. 

 

A. She was short, so I took it as she didn't want to talk. So -- 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) Okay Did you ever contact her at any other time 

with a view towards finding out whether or not she had ever made a 

statement to Mr. Simpson about an alleged relationship that you and 

she had? 

 

A. I tried again and she didn't want to talk about it. 

 

Q. When was the next time that you tried? 

 

A. I can't recall, sir. 

 

Q. Was that also a phone call? 

 

A I think so, but I can't recall when. 

 

Q. Do you remember when that was in relationship to the first phone 

call that you made with a view towards talking to her about this issue? 

Was it shortly thereafter or months or years later? 

 

A. No. It was probably shortly thereafter. 

 

Q. Okay. And did you make a phone call to her? 

 

A Yes. 

 

Q. And did you make the phone call for the specific purpose of talking 

with Nicole about this statement that she made to Mr. Simpson about 

your alleged relationship? 

 

A. Yes 

 

Q. And what did you say to her in that conversation? 

 

A. Basically the same thing "What's going on?" 

 

Q. Okay And when you say, "What's going on," I mean, did you say -- 

 

A. What -- you know, what transpired, what happened. That was 

basically it. And she didn't want to talk about it. So, I dropped the 

issue. 

 

Q. When you say what transpired, what's happening, did you tell her 

that you were talking about this statement she made to Simpson about 

your alleged relationship? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. Well, it was sort of tacit. I think she knew what I was implying. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) When you say it's tacit, I mean, how do she know? 

What did you say to her that led you to believe she knew what you 

were talking about? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. Calls for speculation. 

 

A. I didn't say what was going on, like, "How are you doing?" I said, 

"What was going on, Nic? What is this all about." 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) "What is this all about," referencing the statement? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading.  

 

A. Yes. To paraphrase.  

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) And was she also at home during this 

conversation? 

 

A. Yes, I think so. 

 

Q. Do you know where she was? 

 

A. No, I don't. 

 

Q. Do you know what year this conversation occurred in? 

 

A. No, I don't. 

 

Q. Do you know what month it occurred in? 

 

A. No, I don't, sir. 

 

Q. Do you know where you were when you made the phone call? 

 

A. No , I don't. 

 

Q. And do you remember what she said to you when you made this 

statement? 

 

A. She didn't want to talk about it. 

 

Q. She refused to talk about it? 

 

A. Yes.  

 

Q. Did you talk about anything else in that conversation? 

 

A. No. 

 

Q. Did you ever speak with any of Nicole's friends about the statement 

that she made to Mr. Simpson about your alleged relationship? 

 

A. No, I did not. 

 

Q. Did you make any other efforts to talk to Nicole about this statement 

to Mr. Simpson about your alleged relationship other than the two 

phone calls you have just referenced? 

 

A. No, I did not. 

 

Q. During any of your personal visits with her where you would drop 

by, did that subject ever come up? 

 

A. No, it didn't. 

 

Q. Have you ever heard of Ron Goldman? 

 

A. Not until -- you know. 

 

Q. This all happened? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. The murder. You have seen photographs of him in the media? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Did you recognize him? 

 

A. That's the first time that I ever saw him. 

 

Q. And you have never seen him at Nicole's or at any function that you 

have been at where Nicole has been? 

 

A. No, I haven't. 

 

Q. Did Mr. Simpson ever reference a waiter that Nicole was seeing in 

any discussion you have ever had with him? 

 

MR. LEONAAD: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. No, he did not. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) You made a statement when you were asked about 

the January, 1989, incident that you didn't ask Mr. Simpson about that 

because there are some things that you don't want to know about. Do 

you remember that?  

 

A. Yes.  

 

Q. Have you ever asked Mr. Simpson whether he killed Nicole? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. Yes, I did. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) When did you first ask him that? 

 

A. That was in jail. 

 

Q. When you went to visit him? 

 

A. No. In a phone conversation. 

 

Q. And did you use those words, "Did you kill Nicole?" 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And what did he say? 

 

A. Excuse me. I said, "Did you do it?" 

 

Q. "Did you do it?" 

 

A. Yes. And he said no. 

 

Q. When did you ask him that in the context of this telephone 

conversation that you had? Was this at the beginning, the middle or the 

end? 

 

A. It may have been in the middle during the conversation about 

wanting me to come and testify. 

 

Q. And I take it you asked him the question because you wanted to 

know in your heart whether he, in fact, killed his ex-wife? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. I think everybody wanted to know. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) Did you ever ask him -- did he deny it, say he 

didn't do it? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Asked and answered. 

 

A. Yes, he did. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) Did you ask him for an explanation with respect to 

any of the evidence that you may have seen on T.V.? 

 

A. No, I did not. I felt -- I didn't want to pry. I mean, I felt he was in a -

- you know, he was -- he was in jail. 

 

Q. For example, you have indicated that you watched some of the 

coverage on CNN because you wanted to find out what was going on; 

is that correct? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And I assume that you have spoken with Mr. Cowlings just about 

the facts and circumstances of the murders, true? 

 

A. Don't ask any questions. 

 

Q. You don't ask Mr. Cowlings any questions? 

 

A. No, I don't. 

 

Q. Is that because you don't want to know any answers that may 

implicate Mr. Simpson? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. Argumentative. 

 

A. I just -- I am not interested. I don't want to know. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) For example, you learned when you were watching 

T.V. that a glove was found at Rockingham. Do you remember that 

information going out on T.V.? 

 

A. Yes.  

 

Q. And you have heard that Mr. Simpson's blood was found in Bundy? 

Do you remember hearing that over the T.V.? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And you heard that Nicole's blood was found on socks in his 

bedroom? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And you have heard that -- 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. Leading. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) You want to go ahead and answer yes. 

 

A. I heard those things, yes. 

 

Q. And you never questioned him with respect to his explanation as to 

any of those items ever in any conversation that you have had with 

him? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Compound. Argumentative. Leading. 

 

A. No, I did not. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) Did he ever offer an explanation without your 

asking him with respect to any piece of evidence that was ever found or 

ever disseminated in the news media that implicated him in these 

murders? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague. Lack of foundation. 

Argumentative. 

 

A. No, I did not. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) For example, where he would volunteer an 

explanation with respect to why a glove was found on his premises, did 

he ever tell you anything about that? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Same objections. 

 

A. No. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) Did he ever tell you anything about what he did on 

the 12th, either in the morning, the afternoon or that evening? 

 

A. No, he did not. 

 

Q. That topic has never come up in any of your discussions with Mr. 

Simpson? 

 

A. No, it did not. 

 

Q. Did you know Paula Barbieri? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. How did you know her? 

 

A. I met Paula, I am not quite sure, several years ago. 

 

Q. Several years ago? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Did you have an understanding with respect to whether she had a 

romantic relationship with Mr. Simpson at any time? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And what was your understanding in that regard? 

 

A. Well, I introduced them. 

 

Q. Okay. And how did you meet Paula Barbieri? 

 

A. I beg your pardon? 

 

Q. How did you come to meet her initially? 

 

A. I was just out one evening several years ago. 

 

Q. Okay. And, so, you introduced Paula to O.J. Simpson? 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And do you remember where you introduced them? 

 

A. I think at his home. 

 

Q. And did you understand at some point thereafter they began to see 

one another? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Date, have a romantic relationship? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Do you know whether at the time of Nicole's death Mr. Simpson 

was still seeing Paula Barbieri or dating her? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation. Lack of foundation. 

 

A. No, I don't know. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) Do you know whether he saw her in the last month 

of Nicole's death? 

 

A. No. 

 

Q. At any time after these murders, did you ever speak with Paula 

Barbieri? 

 

A. No, I have not. 

 

Q. Have you seen her since the murders? 

 

A. No, I haven't. 

 

Q. On Memorial Day in 1994, were you in the desert at LaQuinta with 

Mr. Simpson and a group of people playing golf? 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Memorial Day of '94? 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) Yes. '94. 

 

A. No. I don't remember. 

 

Q. Do you know whether Mr. Simpson was in Palm Springs or 

LaQuinta -- 

 

A. Wait. '94?  

 

Q. This is before, the Memorial Day before Nicole's murder. 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Just a few weeks before. 

 

A. No. I wasn't. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) Do you know whether Mr. Simpson was in 

LaQuinta with Paula Barbieri over the Memorial Day weekend playing 

golf?  

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation. Lack of foundation.  

 

A. No, I don't. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) In the last month or two before Nicole's death, did 

you ever go out with Mr. Simpson and Paula Barbieri with Kathryn, 

your wife, social?  

 

A. No. Not that I can recall.  

 

Q. Okay. So, as you sit here today, you have no information yourself 

with respect to whether Mr. Simpson was dating or romantically 

involved with Paula Barbieri the last month of Nicole's life; is that 

correct?  

 

A. That's correct. 

 

Q. Have you spoken to Bob Kardashian after June 12th?  

 

A. No, I haven't.  

 

Q. Have you attempted to speak with him by telephoning his 

residence?  

 

A. No, I haven't. 

 

Q. Is he somebody you would consider a close friend?  

 

A. I consider him a friend, yes.  

 

Q. Do you have any business relationships with Mr. Kardashian?  

 

A. No, I don't.  

 

Q. Have you ever?  

 

A. No. I don't think so.  

 

Q. And you have never either telephoned him or spoke with him 

personally since June 12, 1994? 

 

A. No, I have not. 

 

Q. Mr. Allen, in your police statement, which we marked as Exhibit 1 

to your deposition -- do you have that in front of you by any chance. 

 

MR. BREWER: Counsel, if you can show it to him. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) On page 2, if you can just go to page 2 and go to 

the third -- 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: No. Here it is. 

 

MR. BELLEMERE: That's a damn good copy machine, though. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) Could you please go to the third paragraph where 

it starts out saying, "Mr. Allen described his relationship with Nicole as 

that of acquaintances"? Do you see where it says that? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Would that be an accurate description of your relationship with 

Nicole Simpson at the time of her death? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. Misstates his prior testimony. 

 

A. We were friends. I think this is sort of a -- you know, a 

misunderstanding. A misinterpretation, I guess. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) You were close friends, correct? 

 

A. Yeah. We were friends, good friends. 

 

Q. So, an acquaintance in your view wouldn't be an accurate 

description of your relationship with Nicole at the time of her death, 

would it? 

 

A. No. That's not accurate. 

 

Q. And did you use that term, if you remember, in describing your 

relationship with Nicole to Darden or -- 

 

A. I don't think I did. If I did, I didn't mean to, no.  

 

Q. Other than the two conversations that you had with Nicole over the 

telephone regarding the statement she made to Mr. Simpson about your 

alleged relationship, have you ever spoken with anyone else with a 

view towards trying to verify whether, in fact, Nicole ever told Mr. 

Simpson about an alleged relationship that you and she had? 

 

A. I did not. 

 

Q. Was Kathryn a friend of Nicole's, your wife? 

 

A. I wouldn't say good friends, but they were friendly. 

 

Q. Would you characterize their relationship as acquaintances or as 

friends? 

 

A. Well, she didn't obviously, you know-- you know, border between 

in there, I guess you would say.  

 

Q. Somewhere in between the two?  

 

A. Yeah.  

 

Q. All right. You spoke with Mr. Cowlings the day after -- I am sorry, 

two days after the murders on the 14th. Do you recall that discussion, a 

phone conversation with him? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading.  

 

A. Repeat that again, please.  

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) Do you recall contacting A.C. on June 14th and 

talking with him by telephone? 

 

A. No. Not really. 

 

Q. Do you recall on the 16th talking with Mr. Cowlings for about 47 

minutes by telephone?  

 

A. No, I don't. 

 

Q. In the first couple of days, two or three days after Nicole's death, do 

you recall any telephone conversations that you had with Mr. Cowlings 

that were of a half hour or hour in length? 

 

A. May have been. I am not sure, though. 

 

Q. And do you remember the subject matter of any telephone 

conversations that would have been that length? 

 

A. Just shock and disbelief and no one could believe it. 

 

Q. Did they also involve some substantive discussions with respect to 

some of he evidence that was coming out against Mr. Simpson? 

 

A. May have been but I don't remember.  

 

MR. LEONARD: Move to strike. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) You have no recollection with respect to whether 

that was any part of any conversation you had with Mr. Cowlings? 

  

A. No, I don't. No. 

 

Q. Do you remember Mr. Cowlings saying anything to you with 

respect to whether he thought Mr. Simpson killed Nicole? 

  

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

  

A. He didn't say anything to me. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) Did you know or have you ever heard that as a 

result of the '89 incident Nicole was taken to the hospital? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Compound. Calls for speculation. Lack of 

foundation. 

 

A. I had heard that later. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) And had you also heard that she had contusions 

and a concussion?  

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. Calls for speculation. 

Leading. 

 

A. Well, because of television I think -- I didn't have any prior 

knowledge of that, but because of television I think everybody knows 

now. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) That's how you got that information, from 

television? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. You are very good friends with A.C.; is that correct? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Did A.C. Cowlings -- A.C. ever tell you that he was the person that 

took Nicole to the hospital that evening? 

 

A. I found that out later. 

 

Q. When did you find that out? 

 

A. I can't recall -- I can't recall when but I just found it out later. It may 

have been through television. I don't know. 

 

Q. In connection with this case or some other -- 

 

A. In connection with -- I don't know. I don't know. I can't recall, but I 

had found out that he was the person -- I don't know who said it or 

whatever, but I found he was the person who supposedly took her to 

the hospital. 

 

Q. Did A.C. ever tell you that? 

 

A. No. 

 

Q. Have you ever learned that A.C. was actually at the residence that 

morning? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation. Lack of foundation. 

 

A. I found out later because of the call. When I came to my senses, I 

figured it all out. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) Did you ever talk to A.C. about any of his 

observations that day? 

 

A. What day, sir? 

 

Q. The January incident I am talking about. 

 

A. No. 

 

Q. Have you ever spoken with A.C. about that incident at all? 

 

MR. SCHEPPERS: Other than the one phone conversation? 

 

A. I may have. I can't recall, though.  

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) So, as you sit here today, you don't have a specific 

recollection of talking --  

 

A. No. 

 

Q. Just let me finish my question. 

 

A. I am sorry. He is out of tape. 

 

VIDEO TECHNICIAN: Please stand by. We are going off at 12:07. 

 

(Recess.) 

 

VIDEO TECHNICIAN: We are back on the record, the start of tape 2, 

and it is 12:10. Please continue. 

 

(By Mr. Brewer) I just want to go back and clear up this A.C. thing. 

You had never had any discussions with A.C. about any of his 

observations regarding the New Year's Day incident in '89; is that 

correct? 

 

A. Not that I can recall. 

 

Q. Would it be fair to say when you were in the Caymans, your 

primary source of information here in the States was A.C.? Would that 

be the person that you would contact to find out about this case or Mr. 

Simpson?  

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague. 

 

A. We called a lot of people, sir, but -- because A.C. wasn't always 

available, we called a lot of people. So, that's -- I don't think that's a fair 

assessment. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) Do you believe you spoke with Mr. Cowlings on 

the week of the 13th as many as five or six separate times? 

 

A. No. I wasn't aware of that. 

 

Q. Do you recall speaking with any other individual five or six times 

other than possibly Mr. Cowlings at that same time? 

 

A. Perhaps. I am not sure, sir. 

 

Q. For example, Mr. Hughes, did you contact him? 

 

A. We may have. We called a lot of people, to be honest with you, and 

I am not sure who we all called. 

 

Q. You don't -- you don't recall as you sit here today? 

 

A. No. I don't -- I can't recall everybody that we called.  

 

Q. The issue with respect to the Time article that you talked about 

earlier, just so I am clear on something, did Mr. Simpson ask you to 

actually write an article?  

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. Misstates his prior testimony.  

 

MR. SCHEPERS: I will join in that objection. "Article" is the word Mr. 

Petrocelli used. Mr. Allen has been using the word "letter." 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) Okay. That's what I want to clear up. I just want to 

make sure. That's why I am asking the question because I am not 

certain. Was the -- in the context of the discussion you had with Mr. 

Simpson, were you going to write a -- was it your understanding you 

were going to write a letter or an article? 

 

A. A letter. 

 

Q. And your reasoning for not wanting to do that was because of the 

circus atmosphere that had developed surrounding this case? 

 

A. Absolutely. 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Not this case. 

 

MR. BREWER: "This case" meaning the criminal case. 

 

MR. LEONARD: Yeah. There is no circus around this case. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) Yeah. I take it that you went through kind of a 

balancing test looking at the relationship you had with Mr. Simpson 

and his request to help him versus getting involved in the circus 

atmosphere that you have associated with the criminal case and you 

decided against writing that letter based upon that balancing test? Did 

you go through a similar analysis? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague. Argumentative. Leading. 

 

MR. SCHEPPERS: Do you want him to read it back? 

 

(By Mr. Brewer) You want me to ask it again if you don't understand 

it? 

 

A. Please, yes. 

 

Q. A very good friend of yours asked you to help him by writing a 

letter to a magazine, correct? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And you had some concerns about that because what you identified 

as a circus atmosphere surrounding the case in the criminal case; is that 

correct? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. Asked and answered three times. 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) And I take it that you balances the two, your 

relationship with Mr. Simpson and this circus atmosphere, and decided 

against writing a letter because you didn't want to on balance become 

involved in this circus atmosphere. Is that a fair statement? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague. Leading.  

 

A. Yes. It took some time to do that. And it wasn't an immediate 

response. I mean, yes, I juggled that. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Brewer) I mean, it wasn't a matter of your not having the 

time. I mean, you had the time if you wanted to write a letter, right? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And just so I am clear, there wasn't anything that you felt was false 

or inaccurate that you were being asked too write, that you can recall, 

concerning that article? 

 

A. No. 

 

Q. So, the only reason that you can think of as you sit here today for 

not writing that letter was this circus environment surrounding the 

criminal case that you didn't want to be a part of. Is that a fair 

statement? 

 

A. That's fair. 

 

Q. Thank you. That's all I have. 

 

A. Thank you. 

 

EXAMINAT1ON BY MR. KELLY: 

 

Q. Mr. Allen, in what year did you first meet Nicole, if you recall? 

 

A. At the same time I met O.J.  

 

Q. That was back in '78.? 

 

A. Yes . 

 

Q. And would it be fair to say that over the next 10 to 15 years you got 

to know her very well? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And you considered her a close friend of yours? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And how would you describe Nicole as a person? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague. 

 

A. I think she -- I thought she was a great person. I thought she was a 

wonderful mother. She really cared about the kids. That's it in a nut 

shell basically. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Kelly) Did you find her honest? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Did you find her trustworthy? 

 

A. I think she was pretty trustworthy. 

 

Q. Did you ever know of her to lie on any occasion? 

 

A. Not that I am aware of. 

 

Q. Would you describe her as an emotiona1 person at all? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague. 

 

A. That's sort of difficult. I have never really seen her, you know, in an 

emotional state or whatever. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Kelly) You never -- in your own experiences ever saw her 

get really upset or emotional, did you? 

 

A. No. 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague. 

 

A. No, I didn't. 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Go ahead. 

 

A. No, I did not. 

 

(By Mr. Kelly) Or hysterical in any way? Did you ever see her acting 

like that? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague. 

 

A. No, I did not. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Kelly) And, in your opinion, I think you indicated she was 

a very good mother? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And in your opinion, was she also a very good wife to Mr. Simpson, 

also? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague. Lack of foundation. Calls for 

speculation. 

 

A. From what I know, yes. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Kelly) Okay. And you had never heard through the 

grapevine, I think was the term you used before, that she had ever been 

unfaithful to Mr. Simpson when she was married to him, had you? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. No. I never heard that. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Kelly) And going to the last month or two before her death 

in June, 1994, I think you indicated that you had seen her and spoken 

to her on at least a couple of occasions, had you not? 

 

A. Yes.  

 

Q. And in your experience and having known her for about 15 years at 

that point, how were her spirits in general when you saw and/or spoke 

to her on those occasions? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague. 

 

A. I think they were pretty good. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Kelly) Did she seem depressed to you in any way? 

 

A. No. 

 

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. Vague. 

 

MR. KELLY: I have no further questions. 

 

MR. LEONARD: I would like to take about 15 minutes, and then we'll 

get it done. 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Pardon me? 

 

MR. LEONARD: I would like to take about a 15-minute break. And 

then we can go. It will be about an hour. 

 

(Lunch recess.) 

 

VIDEO TECHNICIAN: We are back on the record. It's 12:31. Please 

continue. 

 

EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD: Good afternoon. I wanted to 

ask you some more questions about your background. You have been a 

professional football player for how long? 

 

A. This will be my 15th season. 

 

Q. And other than playing football, do you have other sources of 

income? 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Is this relevant? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Yeah. I think it is. 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) Okay. And do you engage in a lot of promotional 

activity? 

 

A. Some. Very little actually. 

 

Q. Do you go to card signings and things like that: 

 

A. Very little, yeah. 

 

Q. And you make some public appearances? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Your public image is important to you? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And would you say you have a very close relationship with your 

wife Kathryn? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And your relationship to her is very important to you; is that 

correct? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: I am going to object. .I thought you were bringing 

in background information. This is all leading. So, I am going to object 

on -- every time you ask a leading question on that ground. Objection. 

Leading. 

 

A. Yes. 

 

(By Mr. Leonard) And you don't want to do anything to hurt her, right? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading.  

 

A. Wouldn't any husband? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Can I have a stipulation I don't have to object 

each and every time? 

 

MR. LEONARD: No. You are not going to have that stipulation. 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, I just wanted to make your record a little 

easier but we will do it the hard way. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) Do you have someone who does your public 

relations work, your public appearance work, he is a fellow named 

Mike Gilbert?  

 

A. Yeah. Mike no longer does that, though.  

 

Q. When did Mike stop working for you?  

 

A. Recently.  

 

Q. How recently? 

 

A. In the last -- I think he made some appearances for me, and I 

fulfilled the -- you know, the ones that he had, and I think he decided 

to get out of the business.  

 

Q. When is the last time you spoke to Mike Gilbert?  

 

A. I am not quite sure. A couple of week., three weeks ago. Something 

like that. I am not sure. 

 

Q. So, your testimony is, you have no further business relationship with 

Mr. Gilbert at this point? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. Unless he is behind the scenes because I am dealing with somebody 

else now. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) But to your knowledge, you don't have any 

continuing business relationship with Mr. Gilbert; is that correct? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Objection. Asked and answered. 

 

A. Correct. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) You -- when you first heard about this, these 

murders, you wanted to -- you wanted to stay as far away from the 

matter as you could. Is that fair to say? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 

 

MR. KELLY: Objection. Leading. 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Also argumentative. 

 

A. No That's not my first initial thought I would say I wanted to come 

back and be supportive, and I asked O.J. if I should and he said no. 

And that's it. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) You mentioned in your direct testimony that at 

the time that you were asked about the letter that you wanted to stay 

out of the circus atmosphere: is that right? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And you had that in mind also when Mr. Simpson asked you about 

testifying. Isn't that fair to say? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Objection. Mischaracterizes prior testimony. 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Also vague and ambiguous. 

 

A. No. But that was part of the equation, though. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) You did have that in mind, right? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Same objections. Unclear what you mean by 

"that". 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) Did you understand my question? 

 

A. No. Could you repeat that, please? 

 

Q. When you spoke to Mr. Simpson about testifying at the trial, you 

had in mind that you wanted to stay out of the circus atmosphere, 

correct? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. Argumentative. Misstates his 

prior testimony. 

 

A. Yes. I had -- that was a thought. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) It was a major thought in your mind, wasn't it? 

 

MR. KELLY: Objection. Argumentative. 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Vague. Ambiguous. Leading. 

 

A. No. It wasn't a major thought. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) Is it your testimony that the only reason that you 

didn't come back for Nicole's funeral is because Mr. Simpson 

suggested that you not come back? Is that your testimony? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Argumentative. 

 

MR. KELLY: Objection. That mischaracterizes his previous testimony. 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading.  

 

A. Repeat that again, please.  

 

(By Mr. Leonard) Yeah. Is the only reason you didn't come back for 

Nicole's funeral because Mr. Simpson told you not to come back? Is 

that -- is that fair to say? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Same objections. 

 

A. To my best recollection, yes. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) And you had no thought in mind at that time that 

you wanted to avoid any kind of exposure to the press by going to the 

funeral? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) Is that true? 

 

A. That's true. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) That thought never entered your mind? 

 

A. No, it did not. 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Argumentative. Leading. Move to 

strike the answer for the purpose of interposing the objections. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) You had a series of telephone conversations with 

Mr. Simpson from jail, correct? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Were these conversations all in the late -- early to late summer of 

1994? 

 

 

MR. KELLY: Objection. Vague as to time frame. 

 

A. I can't -- I can't remember. I don't know exactly. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) You can't pinpoint when the last conversation 

took place? You have no idea? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading and argumentative. 

 

A. I can't pinpoint it. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) And the last conversation was the conversation 

which you are testifying was discussed, correct? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Were you -- you spoke with the police and Mr. Darden at some 

point, correct? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Was it your intention to cooperate as fully as you could with the 

police and prosecutors when you spoke with them? 

 

A. To cooperate with everyone. 

 

Q. And including the police and prosecutors, correct? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And I think you have testified already that everything that was in the 

statement was truthful and accurate, correct? 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: No. That's not what he said. 

 

MR. KELLY: Object. 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: That's not what he said. He said that everything 

that he told the police and the investigators was truthful and accurate. 

He hasn't even read the statement and indicated that he never even saw 

it to me off the record. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) Okay. Everything that you -- 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Join in that objection. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) Okay. Everything that you told them was accurate 

and truthful, correct? 

 

A. Yes.  

 

Q. And you weren't trying to hold anything back from the police at that 

point? 

 

MR. SCHEPPERS: Objection. 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Argumentative. 

 

A. No. I wasn't. 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: And leading. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) For instance, if you knew something that was 

harmful to Mr. Simpson, you weren't holding it back, correct? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Argumentative. Leading. 

 

A. No, I wasn't. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) And if you had learned something that was 

harmful to Mr. Simpson after that interview ended, would you have 

told that to the police and prosecutors? 

 

MR. KELLY: Objection as to the form of the question. 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Objection. Calls for speculation. 

 

MR. KELLY: If he knew something after the interview had ended he 

would have told them? 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) Do you understand my question? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: It calls for speculation. 

 

A. No. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) You don't understand the question? 

 

A. No, You must repeat that again, please. 

 

Q. Okay. If you had learned something that was harmful to Mr. 

Simpson after the interview, would you have taken steps to contact the 

police and prosecutors to inform them of it? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Calls for speculation. Argumentative. 

Compound. 

 

MR. SCHEPPERS: Same objection. If he wants to speculate, speculate. 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Vague and leading. 

 

A. If I had any information that possibly could have helped this case, I 

think I would have done so. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) For either side, correct? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Did you mention the conversation about Mr. Simpson wanting to 

testify -- wanting you to testify to Mr. Darden and the police during 

that interview? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: I am going to object on the ground there's 

absolutely no foundation that he was even asked that. It's 

argumentative. It's leading, also. Lacks foundation, argumentative and 

leading. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) Can you pick up the statement, sir, that's marked 

as Exhibit No. 1? I want you to take a look at the statement. I want you 

to take a minute to read the statement in its entirety, if you would 

please.  

 

A. Which one, sir? You don't -- 

 

Q. The entire statement.  

 

A. Read this entire -- 

 

Q. Yes. 

 

MR. KELLY: Then I am going to ask that we go off the record for -- 

 

MR. LEONARD: Sure. That's fine. 

 

MR. KELLY: -- rather than having him sit there on videotape and read 

a statement for five minutes. 

 

MR. LEONARD: That's fine. 

 

MR. KELLY: I wished we had asked him when we had two prior 

breaks when he had plenty of time to read it. Go off the record. 

 

VIDEO TECHNICIAN: Please stand by. It is 12:41. We are off the 

record. 

 

(Recess.) 

 

VIDEO TECHNICIAN: We are back on the record. It's 12:51. Please 

continue.  

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) Have you had a chance to review Exhibit 1, 

which is the statement you provided to the police on -- 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. -- November 22nd -- excuse me, on September 22nd, 1994? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. I would like to direct your attention to page 6, the third paragraph. 

 

A. Uh-huh. 

 

Q. Do you see in that paragraph where you told the police and Mr. 

Darden that you had received several collect calls from Mr. Simpson? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Was that in response to some questions they were asking about 

contacts you had with Mr. Simpson? 

 

A. Frankly, I can't remember.  

 

Q. Do you recall when they were asking you questions -- excuse me. 

Do you recall when you made the statement that you had received 

several collect calls from Mr. Simpson that you already had had the 

conversation about whether you would testify? Do you remember that? 

 

A. No, I don't. 

 

Q. You don't remember one way or the other? 

 

A. No. 

 

Q. Did you at any point after you had the conversation with Mr. 

Simpson ever report that to the police or the prosecutor, the 

conversation regarding whether you would testify or not? 

 

A. No, I did not. 

 

Q. How long have you known Mike Gilbert? 

 

A. Awhile. A long time. 

 

Q. And how would you describe your relationship with Mr. Gilbert? 

 

MR. BREWER: It's vague as to time. 

 

A. I think it's a good relationship. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) You -- over the period of time that you knew Mr. 

Gilbert, did you become friendly with him? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And he handled some of your public relations and promotional 

activities, correct? 

 

A. Specifically -- specifically card shows. That was basically it. 

 

Q. Okay. And you would from time to time travel -- he would travel 

with you or would meet you in locations to -- 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. You have to let me finish. 

 

A. Oh, I am sorry. I though- you were done. I apologize. 

 

Q. -- when you would go to card shows? 

 

A. Are you done? 

 

Q. Yeah. 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. Okay. Do you believe Mr. Gilbert to be an honest person? 

 

A. I think he is. 

 

Q. Have you ever had any occasion to -- where you knew that Mr. 

Gilbert was lying? 

 

A. No. I don't think so. I think he is a pretty honest guy. 

 

Q. And you had trusted him to assist you in your business enterprises to 

some extent, correct? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading and misstates his testimony. 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) Okay. And why is it that you no longer have a 

business relationship with Mr. Gilbert? 

 

A. I think because of all that have -- that has happened, Mike, I guess 

he was under a lot of strain, and he had said he had gotten several death 

threats, and stuff, for I guess his working relationship with O.J., and he 

decided it was time to get out of business. I think he put his family 

before, you know, everything else, I guess. 

 

Q. And is that something that Mr. Gilbert told you that he was getting 

out of the business and no longer wanted to have a relationship with 

you? Is that your testimony?  

 

A. With me? 

 

Q. Yeah. 

 

A. I didn't -- I don't think he said he didn't want to have a relationship 

with me. He just said he couldn't -- you know, he was moving on, he 

was getting out of this business. It was too stressful under the 

circumstances. 

 

Q. And he had -- 

 

A. That's paraphrasing. 

 

Q. And he told you that directly? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. When did he tell you that? 

 

A. Awhile ago. 

 

Q. How long ago? 

 

A. Months ago. 

 

Q. Do you have any idea whether Mr. Gilbert is coming into Kansas 

City this weekend for any type of a card show that involves you? 

 

A. No, I am not. 

 

Q. You have no -- you are not aware of that? 

 

A. No. There was originally a show supposed to be on Father's Day or 

something that I canceled or something, but to my knowledge, no one 

is coming here. 

 

Q. You canceled a card show? 

 

A. Well, I canceled my appearance. I couldn't -- you know. 

 

Q. And that was something that Mr. Gilbert was -- 

 

A. I don't know if he did it or not, but he had mentioned it, and I don't 

know if he is the one that put it together or not. 

 

Q. But he mentioned it to you? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. And you called him at some point and canceled it? 

 

A. : think he had mentioned the date -- this is sort of confusing because 

there was somebody else trying to get me to do the same show, and 

because of the conflict, I decided not to do it.  

 

Q. And when did you -- and you related that to Mr. Gilbert? 

 

A. I think I did. 

 

Q. When? Just approximately when that was, if you can recall. 

 

A. I don't know. A month ago or something like that. 

 

Q. Now, you have denied under direct examination that you have had -

- that you had any sexual contact at all with Nicole; is that correct? 

 

A. That's correct. 

 

Q. And by that did you mean that -- and I think you were asked 

questions such as whether you had even kissed her before. 

 

A. Right. 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Romantically kissed her.  

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard} Romantically kissed her. Well, let me ask you. 

Have you ever kissed her in a non-romantic fashion? Let me ask you 

that. 

 

A. On the cheek, yes. 

 

Q. Okay. But you deny any other type of sexual activity with her at any 

point? 

 

A. Yes. Yes, I do. 

 

Q. For instance, you deny any type of fondling or foreplay or anything 

like that; is that correct? 

 

A. Yes, I do. 

 

Q. Do you recall traveling to Buffalo in October of 1994 for a 

Chiefs/Buffalo game? Do you remember that? 

 

A. Well, yes, of course. 

 

Q. You do? 

 

A. Yeah. 

 

Q. You stayed at the Hyatt Hotel? 

 

A. I guess, yeah. 

 

Q. And there was a card show that -- during that game, correct?  

 

A. Correct. 

 

Q. At the weekend of that game, right? 

 

A. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, I rarely do card shows the same 

weekend we have a game. So -- 

 

Q. Well, let me ask you this. Do you recall Mr. Gilbert being with you 

in the hotel? 

 

A. Oh, okay. A private signing. That's what you call it. He brings in 

stuff for me to sign, yes. 

 

Q. Oh, okay. So -- 

 

A. So -- yeah. So, it's not like a show. 

 

Q. I don't know what you do. I am sorry. 

 

A. Well -- 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: You are walking over him. 

 

A. Sorry. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) He brought some items -- 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Listen to the question. 

 

A. He brought some items for me to sign. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) Okay. And you both stayed in the hotel together, 

right? He was in one room and you were in another room? 

 

A. Yes. I -- I assume he was. I don't know if he stayed there or not. He 

came to your room at some point? Do you remember that? 

 

A. No. I think he had a room. I don't know if he was staying in that 

room. I don't think he came to my room.  

 

Q. You have no recollection of him being in your room at any time? 

 

A. No, I don't. I think I went to a room where the items were, sir. 

 

Q. Oh, okay. My question, though, is, and I want you to think 

carefully, you have no recollection of Mr. Gilbert going to your room 

at any point; is that correct? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. No, I don't. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) Are you saying it could have happened but you 

don't recall it or that it did not happen? 

 

MR. KELLY: Objection. Argumentative and compound. 

 

A. I don't recall him coming to my room. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) Do you recall going to his room? I don't mean 

where the items were set up, but his room where it appeared that he 

was actually staying? 

 

A. No. 

 

MR. KELLY: Objection. Asked and answered and asked and 

answered. 

 

MR. LEONARD: No. I thought that was -- 

 

A. No. I don't recall that. 

 

MR. KELLY: Think whatever you want. That's all right. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) You don't recall? 

 

A. No. 

 

Q. Now, shortly before this -- this occasion when you were in Buffalo 

with Mr. Gilbert, there was a -- there were some tabloid articles about 

you and the possibility of you having an affair with Nicole. Do you 

recall that? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. Yes.  

 

(By Mr. Leonard) And that was something that upset you, correct? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading.  

 

A. The allegations in and of themself, yes.  

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) And do you recall Mr. Gilbert telling you that he 

had bought all the tabloids and all the magazines that were -- were 

tabloid-type magazines that contained these articles at the gift shop, 

that he had actually bought them all to remove them from public view? 

Do you recall him telling you that?  

 

A. No. 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading.  

 

A. I don't recall him saying that. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) Do you know if he did that? 

 

A. No, I don't. No. 

 

Q. Were you being teased or ribbed by your teammates about this -- 

what was in the tabloids? 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Do you have a time frame? 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) Yeah. Let's say during that time period. That is in 

-- let's say in October of 1994. Do you recall that? 

 

A. There may have just one or two guys. Most of them were pretty 

sensitive to what was going on. 

 

Q. But you were upset by the individuals -- individual teammates that 

were ribbing you, correct? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading.  

 

A. No. I didn't get upset at any individuals.  

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) It didn't bother you?  

 

A. No. 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Leading.  

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) Do you recall discussing that with Gilbert? 

 

A. No, I don't. 

 

Q. The fact that -- that you were being teased? 

 

A. No. I don't recall that. 

 

Q. It could have happened. You don't recall it? 

 

A. I don't recall it. 

 

MR. KELLY: Objection. Argumentative. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) Did you -- again, during -- I am directing your 

attention to this -- the time that you were with Gilbert in October of 

1994 at the Hyatt Hotel. Do you recall that there was a -- some type of 

a contest on a local radio station involving driftwood? Do you 

remember that?  

 

A. No, I don't.  

 

Q. You didn't -- you don't know anything about that?  

 

A. No. I don't remember that.  

 

Q. You don't remember Mr. Gilbert discussing that with you? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. I don't remember that.  

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) Do you recall Mr. Gilbert telling you that he had 

called the radio station and demanded that they stop the contest? Do 

you remember that? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. No, I don't. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) This -- you have no memory of anything like that 

happening? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading and argumentative. 

 

A. No. 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Also asked and answered. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) Is that your testimony? 

 

MR. PETROCELL1: Same objections. 

 

A. Yes. I don't -- I don't recall that. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) Do you recall having a discussion with Mr. 

Gilbert about Faye Resnick's book and some allegations in Faye 

Resnick's book? 

 

MR. KELLY: Same time period, Dan? 

 

MR. LEONARD: Yes. Same occasion. 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. That, I do recall. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) And Mr. Gilbert told you what was in the book? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. I can't remember if he told me. I think my attorney might have told 

me. Not these gentlemen but my attorney in Los Angeles. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) Okay. But you had a discussion with Mr. Gilbert 

about that, right? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. I think -- I think -- I think Mike mentioned that, yes. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) Did you tell him you were upset about that? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 

 

MR. KELLY: And I believe that -- this is a conversation with his 

attorney you are asking about? 

 

MR. LEONARD: No. Gilbert. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) You understood I was asking you about Mr. 

Gilbert, right? 

 

A. Yes. 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. I may have been dis -- yeah. Upset, disappointed, yeah. Wouldn't 

you? 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) During that -- 

 

A. I mean, I am just asking the question. I mean, it's sort of obvious. 

 

Q. During that discussion with Mr. Gilbert, did you tell him that you 

had had oral sex with Nicole Simpson? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. No, I did not. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) You deny that? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading and argumentative. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) Do you deny that, sir? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading and argumentative. 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Asked and answered. 

 

A. Yes. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) You said earlier in your direct testimony that you 

couldn't recall anyone else that you had discussed this issue of having a 

relationship with Nicole other than a few individuals. You didn't 

mention Mr. Gilbert; isn't that correct? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading and argumentative.  

 

MR. KELLY: Objection. Mostly mischaracterizes his answer. He just 

denied having this conversation with Mr. Gilbert. 

 

A. I did not say that to Mr. Gilbert. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) You discussed with Mr. Gilbert the issue or the 

allegation that you had a relation -- romantic relationship with Nicole 

Simpson, correct? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. No, I did not. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) You did not? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) That was not part of the discussion? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 

 

A. No, I did not. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) What did you discuss about Faye Resnick's book 

with him? 

 

A. I think the fact that I was in there, and I said I think, "I don't want to 

hear that crap," or -- you know. 

 

Q. And you were in there and you were discussing the fact that you 

were in there because there was an allegation of a romantic 

involvement with Nicole, correct? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: Objection. Mischaracterizes his testimony. 

 

MR. KELLY: Outright harassment at this point, too, of the witness. 

 

A. It was -- repeat that again, please. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) Yeah. Do you recall that the discussion about 

Faye Resnick's book and the fact that you were in it involved her 

allegation that you had a romantic relationship with Nicole? 

 

MR. PETROCELL1: Same objections. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) Do you recall that? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Same objections. 

 

A. I do recall that. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) Okay. 

 

A. And I told him I didn't want to hear that stuff. 

 

Q. So, you did have a discussion about this issue with Mr. Gilbert? 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Leading. 

 

A. He brought it up, and I said, "I don't want -- I don't want to talk 

about it. I don't want to hear that stuff. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) When is the last time -- strike that. Have you had 

-- ever had any other discussions with Mr. Gilbert about this issue? 

And when I say this issue, I mean the allegation that you had a 

romantic relationship with Nicole Brown Simpson other than the 

discussion you had in the hotel room in October of 1994? 

 

A. Not that I can recall, no. 

 

Q. When you say that, sir, I want it to be very clear. 

 

A. I don't think I did, but -- 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Argumentative. 

 

A. Yeah. I don't -- I have no memory of having another conversation 

with Mr. Gilbert.  

 

Q. (By Mr. Leonard) You may have, but you don't recall? Is that what 

you are saying? 

 

MR. KELLY: Objection. Augmentative. 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: And leading. 

 

A. I nave no memory of one at this point. 

 

MR. LEONARD: I don't have any further questions. 

 

RE-EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI: 

 

Q. I just have one question. You -- do you see in your police statement 

that there is a reference that you offered financial assistance? 

 

MR. SCHEPERS: I believe that mischaracterizes his statement. I am 

sorry, Dan. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) I am just referring to your -- to the police 

statement, Exhibit 1. 

 

MR. KELLY: Page 6, paragraph 3 that you looked at before. 

 

Q. (By Mr. Petrocelli) It says there, and I will quote the statement, "He 

has not been asked for any financial assistance but has offered, end of 

quotes.  

 

A. Yeah.  

 

Q. Did you see that statement?  

 

A. Yeah, I think I did.  

 

Q. Did you offer Mr. Simpson financial assistance?  

 

A. I think I did, yes. 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you. No further questions. 

 

MR. KELLY: No further questions. 

 

MR. BREWER: No questions. 

 

MR. LEONARD: No questions. 

 

MR. PETROCELLI: Let's put on our -- a stipulation which has

last name?

notification from you within 30 days of your receipt, then a certified 

copy of the transcript can be used in lieu of the original, for all 

purposes, including trial, and that the witness can sign the transcript 

under penalty of perjury.

<P>Kimberly Goldman described her brother, Ronald, as having played a central role in raising her, in this Feb. 5, 1996 deposition. After her parents split up, he helped take care of her when her father was at work. Defense lawyers probed Goldman for her family's motivations in bringing wrongful death charges against O.J. Simpson. Goldman said she was shocked that her mother filed a suit because Ronald hadn't seen the  woman in more than 15 years before his death.</P>

KIMBERLY E. GOLDMAN, a witness herein, having been sworn, 
testifies as follows: 
 
EXAMINATION BY MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. Good morning. My name is Phil Baker. I  represent the defendant in 
this action. Could you state and spell your name for the record. 
 
A. Kimberly Erin Goldman, K-i-m-b-e-r-l-y E-r-i-n G-o-l-d-m-a-n. 
 
Q. I know you've had a chance to speak to your  attorney this morning. 
I want to go over a couple of the ground rules  before we start so you 
understand them. 
 
First of all, if we touch on anything sensitive or if you ever want to take  
a break, we'll take a break for however long you want. 
 
Secondly, the court reporter has placed you under oath. That's under 
penalty of perjury. That's the same oath that you'd take in a court of 
law. You're still bound  by the penalties of perjury as if you were in a 
court of  1aw. 
 
The court reporter will be taking down everything  that's said here 
today. 
 
After we're done here, as you may or may not know,  you'll be getting a 
booklet-form transcript of all that was said here.  You'll have an 
opportunity to review it, make any  changes that you want on the 
deposition transcript. If you do make any changes, rest assured, we'll  
probably talk about it at the time of trial. 
 
Thirdly, I'd request you audibilize everything you say today. "Uh-huh," 
''huh-uh" doesn't show up well on the record, and it's hard to determine 
what was said. Do you have any questions of me? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Good. What -- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: One second before you begin. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. What is your date of birth? 
 
A. 12-26-71. 
 
Q. What's your Social Security number? 
 
A. [Number deleted]  
 
Q . Is it your understanding Mr. Petrocelli is representing you during 
this deposition? 
 
A. Yes, it is. 
 
Q. You understand that you're no longer a party  to this lawsuit, true? 
 
A. Correct. 
 
Q. As a matter of fact, you were dismissed from  this lawsuit on 
September 11th, 1995, true? 
 
A. If that's the date, yes. 
 
Q. Is Mr. Petrocelli handling any other matter  for you? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. When's the first time you met Mr. Petrocelli? 
 
A. Sometime in October. I don't remember the exact date. 
 
Q. Did you ever meet Mr. Tourtelot? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And he's no longer your attorney; is that true? 
 
A. That's true. 
 
Q. How many meetings have you had with Mr. Petrocelli or anyone 
from this law office? 
 
A. Several. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  You mean about the deposition? 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. About the deposition, about this lawsuit. 
 
A. Since we hired him? 
 
Q. Yes. 
 
A.  I don't know. Several dozen, probably. 
 
Q. You said, "we hired him."  Does that mean you and your father? 
 
A. As a family. 
 
Q. Do you have any financial interest in this  lawsuit? 
 
A. In what lawsuit? 
 
Q. The lawsuit against O.J. Simpson, the civil lawsuit. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: In other words -- You can answer. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. Has your father ever promised you any percentage of any proceeds 
obtained as a result of this lawsuit? 
 
A. Never discussed it. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me. 
 
(Witness and her counsel confer off the record.) 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The question was, were you ever promised, and 
you answered you "never discussed it." You didn't answer the question. 
 
THE WITNESS:  Did he ever promise me? No.  
 
MR. P. BAKER:  
 
Q. You never discussed it?   
 
A. He never promised me. 
 
Q. Have you ever discussed it? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Do you have any other lawsuits for which you  are a plaintiff?  
 
A. No. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: She's not a plaintiff in this lawsuit either. 
 
MR. P. BAKER:   
 
Q. Any lawsuits which you are a defendant? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Have you ever filed a lawsuit? 
 
A. Yes. I believe from my car accident I don't know if  that was a 
lawsuit. Sorry. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You just testify to the best of  your recollection. 
 
THE WITNESS: Sorry. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. When do you think that lawsuit may have occurred? 
 
A. In '85, '86. 
 
Q. Did you ever obtain any compensation  as a result of that possible 
lawsuit? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. How much? 
 
A. I don't know the exact dollar amount. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I think her testimony was, she wasn't sure if  there 
was even a lawsuit. There was some sort of claim, apparently.  
 
THE WITNESS: Okay. No. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Don't make up a lawsuit if one  didn't exist.  
Testify to the best of your memory.  
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. You have no idea how much you made as a result  of that claim? 
 
A. Not the exact amount, no. 
 
Q. Can you give me an estimate? 
 
MR. BREWER: Seems to me this line of inquiry is not  reasonably 
calculated to lead to the discovery of any  admissible evidence in this 
case, how much she got from another lawsuit. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You just jumped the gun on me. I concur. 
 
MR. P. BAKER:  You can answer. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: If you got anything. Excuse me. 
 
(Witness and her counsel confer off the record.) 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I'll instruct her not to answer on  the grounds  that 
it's not relevant. It's something that happened 10 years ago. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: Could you mark that.   
 
THE REPORTER Yes. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. What time did you arrive here today? 
 
A. About 9:15. 
 
Q. Did you have a meeting with anyone? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. What did you do from 9:15 to l0:00? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Wait for me. 
 
THE WITNESS: Waited for Dan. I used the restroom and had coffee 
and wandered. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. Have you ever met Mr. Brewer before today? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. When? 
 
A. Formal introduction? 
 
Q. Anytime you've had any contact with Mr. Brewer. Formal 
introduction would have been at Mr. Simpson's deposition. 
 
Q. You never met him before that day? 
 
A. I think I'm confused with the word "met." I've seen him. I was never 
formally introduced to him until  Simpson's deposition. 
 
Q. Maybe I'm unclear. When's the first time you've spoken with Mr. 
Brewer? 
 
A. When we were formally introduced at, Mr. Simpson's deposition. 
 
Q. You had never spoken with him before that,  true? 
 
A. True. 
 
Q. You didn't speak to him today before this deposition, did you? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Have you ever attended any meetings between  your father and Mr. 
Petrocelli? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. How many? 
 
A. 10 or 15 maybe. 
 
Q. When was the first meeting? 
 
A. Within the first week of us hiring him. 
 
Q. Do you know how you paid for Mr. Tourtelot's  representation? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I think that's irrelevant. I'll instruct her not to 
answer. Hold on one second. 
 
(Witness and her counsel confer off the record.) 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The witness doesn't know, in any  event; I 
checked with her. But it's irrelevant. 
 
MR. P. BAKER:  
 
Q. The first meeting you had with Mr.  Petrocelli  and your father was 
when? 
 
A. Within the first week of us hiring him. 
 
Q. What do you recall from that meeting? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I'll instruct her not to answer on  the ground of the 
attorney-client privilege. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: Do you understand that Ms. Goldman was not a party 
to the lawsuit at that time? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes, I understand. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: Are you -- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Might have been a party at that  time. I don't 
know when that dismissal was effected. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: September 11th, 1995. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Just to save you the burden of  having to  question 
her about this, instruct the witness not to disclose any of her 
conversations or communications with me on the ground of the 
attorney-client privilege.  
 
MR. P. BAKER: Although she was dismissed from the lawsuit prior to 
your initiation of representation? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Correct. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: Does that same objection go to any  conversations 
with any attorney from the Mitchell, Silberberg & Knupp office? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Correct, if she's had any with them. 
  
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. Have you had any conversations with  any other  attorneys at 
Mitchell, Silberberg & Knupp? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Other than a casual banter? 
         
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. Regarding the lawsuit. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Substantive conversations. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. Who? 
 
A. Peter Gelblum and Ed Medvene. 
 
Q. How many conversations with Peter Gelblum? 
 
A. Half a dozen maybe. 
 
Q. How about Ed Medvene?  
 
A. Same. Half a dozen.  
 
MR. P. BAKER: And I suppose Mr. Petrocelli, you  won't allow us to 
ever ask about any conversations she'd had with Mr. Gelblum or Mr. 
Medvene? 
 
MR.. PETROCELLI: Correct. And any members of our  firm on the 
ground of attorney-client privilege,  as well as  attorney work product. 
 
MR. P. BAKER:  
 
Q. Have you had any conversations with your  father about this 
lawsuit?  
 
A. Numerous.  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Baker, because of my instruction, I believe, is 
now asking about conversations with your father in which counsel were 
not participants.  
 
THE WITNESS: I understand. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. When was the first time you and your father discussed the civil 
lawsuit? 
 
A. I need to ask a question. 
 
Q. Of your lawyer? Do you want to take a break?  
 
A. No. 
 
(Witness and her counsel confer off the record.) 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I would say the very first time.  That's the 
understanding I have of the question.  
 
THE WITNESS: Probably in March or April of '94. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. What do you remember from that conversation? 
 
A. Just that we needed to decide whether we  wanted to file or not. 
 
Q. And what did you recommend? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: If anything. 
 
THE WITNESS: I didn't recommend anything. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. Is that all you remember from that conversation? 
 
A. Vaguely, yes. 
 
Q. Was anyone else there? 
 
A. The rest of the family. 
 
Q. Who is "the rest of the family"? 
 
A. My dad's wife, Patti; And my stepbrother and sister, Michael and

MR. P. BAKER: Maybe somebody told her. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: As phrased, I object, but you can  answer. 
 
THE WITNESS: What was the question? 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q: "When was the last time Ms. Rufo ever saw Ron Goldman?" 
 
MR. BREWER Question lacks foundation, calls for  speculation. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Same objections. 
    
THE WITNESS: To the best of my knowledge, roughly 15, 16 years 
ago earlier. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: 15, 16 years earlier than what? 
 
THE WITNESS: His death. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. When was the last time you saw Sharon Rufo  prior to June of 
1994? 
 
A. 6 years, roughly.   
 
Q. Do you know if Ms Rufo ever had any contact  whatsoever that you 
know of with Ron Goldman in the last 15 years before his death in June 
of 1994?    
 
A. I know of one conversation.  
 
Q. When was that? 
 
A. '92, I think. 
 
Q. Do you know what that was regarding? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. How did you learn of the conversation? 
 
A. Ron told me. 
 
Q. What did he tell you about it? 
 
A. He told me that he called Sharon. 
 
Q. Did he tell you about what? 
 
A. Just to chat. 
 
Q. Anything else you remember about what he told you about that 
conversation at all?  
 
A. Just general conversation, nothing specific.  
 
Q. Did they plan on seeing one another? Do you  recall that? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Lack of foundation. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. Did he tell you?   
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The question is, did Ron tell you  that he planned 
on seeing Sharon Rufo in  that conversation  in 1992? 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. Did Ron tell you that he planned on speaking  with her again? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. When you found out that Ms. Rufo filed this lawsuit, you were 
shocked? 
 
A. Correct. 
 
Q. And why were you shocked? 
 
A. Because at this point, I didn't know that  that  was an option; I didn't  
understand what filing a civil suit meant. 
 
Q. You were shocked because you didn't believe she had a right to file 
this lawsuit, true? 
 
A. After I understood what it meant to file a lawsuit. 
 
Q. And the answer is true? 
 
A. True. 
 
Q. In fact, you called up Larry King on January 25th, 1995, when she 
was a guest on that show, didn't you? 
 
A. Yes 
  
Q. Why did you call the show that day? 
 
A. Because I wanted to confront her on some  issues. 
 
Q. Which issues? 
 
A. Whatever she was speaking of at the  time I don't remember 
specifically. 
 
Q. You don't recall what you wanted to confront  her on? 
 
A. That was a year ago I don't remember specifically what the issues 
were at the time. 
 
Q. You were upset she was filing a lawsuit and obtaining fame as a 
result of that lawsuit, true? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: "Obtaining fame"? 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. Seeking fame? 
 
MR. BREWER: Objection. Question is argumentative,  also, 
compound. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He's asking you questions in a  leading form, 
which he's entitled to, but you should evaluate whether what he's 
saying is what your belief is.  If it's not, then tell him so. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. Is that your belief? 
 
A. I don't remember specifically at the time why I called. That was 
over a year ago. 
 
Q. Let me read part of the transcript that may help you. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Want to show it to her? 
 
MR. P. BAKER: Sure. I think we have another copy. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Are you going to mark this? 
 
MR. P. BAKER: Let's mark it. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I want to start at 1000. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: We'll mark this 1000. It's a  transcript from the Larry 
King show on numerous dates, and the date which I'm referring begins 
on page 9. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: This is Exhibit 1000? 
 
MR. P. BAKER: Let's make it 1001. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: And what's the date of the show? 
 
MR. P. BAKER: The transcript we have is of January  25th, 1995. It's a 
segment of the transcript.   
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Larry King is a prominent witness in this case. 
 
MR. BREWER: When you say "it's a segment," are you  talking about 
a segment of a show that reflects their  conversation or segment of their 
conversation? 
 
MR. P. BAKER: Segment of the show that reflects their conversation. 
    
MR. BREWER It's being shown to refresh her  recollection with 
respect to what issue? 
    
MR. P. BAKER: What she was upset about. 
   
MR. PETROCELLI: Is this document, Exhibit 1001, transcript of the 
spoken words on  that entire show? 
 
MR. P. BAKER: No. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It is not. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: From what I  understand, this is a CNN show that 
took together aspects of segments of shows and  put them together into 
1 show. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: And your belief is that one of the  segments dealt 
with Ms. Goldman's -- 
 
MR. P. BAKER: Turn to page 9,  refers to a January  25th, 1995 call. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You understand he is not  representing that this is 
a transcript of what you said. It may or may not be accurate. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: Look on page 11, and it describes  how it was -- 
 
MR. P. BAKER: -- transcribed. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Correct. And it is not obviously the entire 
interview. Okay. What's your question, Mr. Baker?  
 
MR. P. BAKER: Do you want her to have a chance to  read that? It 
goes back to page 10.  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Why don't you start reading over  here 
(indicating), and then go through page 10. 
 
MR. BREWER: Do you have another copy of 1001 in  front of  you?  
 
MR. P. BAKER: Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. Does the transcript reflect or assist your recollection regarding that 
phone call? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Now, do you recall why you were upset? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Why were you upset? 
 
A. Because she was saying she was feeling left  out or there wasn't 
enough attention being paid to her. 
 
Q. And that bothered you, right?  
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And it bothered you because Sharon Rufo and  Ron Goldman had 
hardly any contact prior to his death, true? 
 
A. Yes.  
 
Q. It bothered you because she left your family when you were 3 years 
old, true? 
 
A. True. 
 
Q. In fact, you didn't even think Sharon Rufo would have recognized 
Ron Goldman if he walked down the street in June of 1994, true? 
 
MR. BREWER: Objection. Argumentative, lacks foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: At that time, yes. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. "At that time, yes." You didn't think she would recognize him in 
June  1994? 
 
A. Correct. 
 
Q. Did you learn of anything that would change  your opinion about 
that? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. What did you learn? 
 
A. She was given photos of my brother and I. 
 
Q. When was she given photos of your  brother? 
 
A.  I have no idea. 
 
Q. When did she receive those photos? 
 
A. I have no idea. 
 
Q. Do you know if it was prior to his death or after his death? 
 
A. Prior. 
 
Q. How did you find out she received  photos? 
 
A. I believe she told me she was given photos  from my grandparents. 
 
Q. What are your grandparents' names? 
 
A. Julius -- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: These  particular grandparents? 
 
MR. P. BAKER: Yes. Sorry. 
 
THE WITNESS: Julius and Blanche Fohrman. 
 
MR. P. BAKER 
 
Q. Where do they live? 
 
[City and State Deleted]  
 
 
Q. She told you that they had sent pictures of  Ron to Sharon Rufo? 
 
A. Correct. 
 
Q. When did she tell you that? 
 
A. I don't think I remember specifically  when that conversation -- 
 
Q. Was it during the criminal trial? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. After the criminal trial? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Prior to the criminal trial.? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Prior to his death? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That she learned about the photos? 
 
MR. P. BAKER: Yes. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember if it was before he died. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. In that conversation with Larry King, you said, "Sharon, people see 
right through you, Honey."  What did you mean by that? 
 
A. That maybe she was doing it for the wrong  reasons. 
 
Q. What reasons did you think she was doing it  for? 
 
A. Monetary reasons. 
 
Q. Do you still think that? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It's irrelevant. 
 
MR. BREWER: When you say "that" just to make sure I'm clear on 
your question, did Sharon Rufo file a civil lawsuit in Superior Court for 
monetary reasons; is that the  gist of  your question when you say she 
thought that?  
 
MR. P. BAKER: I think the record reflects what was asked and  
answered.  
 
MR. BREWER: Move to strike  the answer to interpose  the objection 
as vague and ambiguous. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. Is it your position that this lawsuit filed by your family has nothing 
to do with money? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I instruct her not to answer. She doesn't have a 
position. She's here to give you  information or knowledge she has as a 
witness. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: She doesn't have a position as to  this lawsuit? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: If she does, it's in her personal view, it's not 
relevant, and you're not entitled to know. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: In your view I want to understand the nature of you 
not allowing questions. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The nature of the objection on her position is 
irrelevant, and I instruct her not to answer. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. Have you ever made any public statements about  why this lawsuit 
was filed? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. What have you said? 
 
A. To ensure justice. 
 
Q. Have you ever said that you were not seeking any monetary 
compensation as a result of this filing? 
 
A. I said that it was not about the money. 
 
Q. When was the last time you spoke with Sharon  Rufo?   
 
MR. BREWER:   In person, telephonically?  
 
MR. P. BAKER:  
 
Q.  Either way. 
 
A.  January of '95. 
 
Q. This phone call (indicating). 
 
A. Oh, yes, this would be the last, I believe. Wait. Let me think. This 
may have been the last time. 
 
Q. Do you know what she does for a living? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Do you know where she lives? 
 
A. St. Louis. 
 
Q. Do you know how she earns a living? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Do you know how she supports herself? 
 
A. No.

father regarding this lawsuit, and we got through a few, but I don't 
think we discussed some in their entirety. 
 
Can you name for me the first conversation you had  with your father 
regarding this lawsuit following Mr. Simpson's acquittal on October 
3rd, 1995?

lawsuit?

Q. Has he ever told you about the progress of the suit? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. What's he told you? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Do not discuss anything that your  father said to 
you that was communicated to him by lawyers  representing him in the 
case. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: You don't believe there's a waiver of the attorney-
client privilege? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No, Mr. Baker, I do not believe that. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: Can you mark that, please. 
 
THE REPORTER: Yes. 
 
MR. P. BAKER:  
 
Q. You can still answer.  
 
A. Can you repeat that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let me clarify where we are on  this, Kim. He's 
asking you a question about conversations that  you had with your 
father after Mr. Simpson's acquittal about the subject of the lawsuit.  
And you may answer if you recall, except you are not  to discuss any 
information that your father disclosed to you that came from counsel. 
 
If you are able to answer with those limitations,  please do so. If you're 
not, then you must not answer. Okay? 
 
THE WITNESS: Okay. What was the question now? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I want you  to listen to what I said because I gave 
you the question. 
 
So please read that back, Ms. Reporter.

had learned from his attorneys, true?

MR. PETROCELLI: That's different now. I'm  confused. I  thought you 
were asking questions to obtain  information about Ron. Now you've

check, or something, they put you on. Stuff like that. I don't know 
specifically off the top of my  head.  
 
Q. When did he file bankruptcy?  
 
A. '92. 
 
Q. Do you know how much he owed?  
 
A. I don't remember specifically.  
 
Q. Do you have an estimate? 
 
A. 10-grand area maybe; would be a real high estimate, though. I think 
that's high, but -- 
 
Q. About 10,000?  
 
A. Yeah. I think that might be high, but that would maybe be a guess.  
 
Q. That was the same year he called Sharon Rufo, true? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Are you asking her again? 
 
MR. P. BAKER:  
 
Q. He called Sharon Rufo in 1992, true? 
 
A. I think it may have been '92.  Could have been '91. 
 
Q. Do you know if the purposes of that call was to call her and ask her 
for some money? 
 
A. No, that wasn't the purpose. 
 
Q. Any other bankruptcy filings other than the  '92? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Last time you saw Ron and your father together, when was that? 
 
A.  Passover '94. 
 
Q. Where were you when you learned of Ron's death? 
 
A. I was at home, San Francisco. 
 
Q. How did you learn of the news? 
 
A. My dad and Patti called me and told me.  
 
Q. And then you returned to Los Angeles? 
 
A. That evening, yes. 
 
Q. Did you ever return to San Francisco? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. When was that? 
 
A. End of June of '94. 
 
Q. How long did you stay back in San Francisco? 
 
A. For about a week, and I came back to Los  Angeles for the 
preliminary hearing in July. 
 
Q. Did you attend everyday of the preliminary  hearing? 
 
A. Not the first 2 days. 
 
Q. Did you move down to Los Angeles by July of  1994? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. When did you return to San Francisco? 
 
A. Within a week of the preliminary hearing  ending. 
 
Q. How long did you live in San Francisco? 
 
A. Until January of '95. 
 
Q. Then you returned to Los Angeles -- 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. -- and moved into your family's home in Agoura  Hills? 
 
A. Correct. 
 
Q. Did you talk to anyone about the civil  trial  at the dinner for Phil 
Vannatter? 
 
MR. BREWER: Civil trial?  
 
MR. P. BAKER:  
 
Q. I apologize. The civil lawsuit. 
 
A. Maybe generally, just how were things going. 
 
Q. Who did you speak to? 
 
A. I don't remember. 
 
Q. But you talked about the status of the litigation? 
 
A. No. "How is it going?" "Fine, thank you." That was it. 
 
Q. Did you speak to Phil Vannatter at that trial -- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Dinner. 
 
THE WITNESS: Dinner, yes. 
 
MR. P. BAKER. 
 
Q. What was that conversation about? 
 
A. "Congratulations on your retirement." Wished him good luck. 
 
Q. Did he mention that he had been served with a subpoena for his 
deposition in this case? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Anybody else you remember speaking to at all  that evening, anyone 
you  remember specifically talking about the civil lawsuit with? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Did you ever hear the name Faye Resnick prior  to June 12th, '94? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Following the jury's acquittal on October 3rd,  there was a press 
conference attended by your family. I believe Robert Tourtelot was 
there, the deputy  district attorneys, and Gil Garcetti. 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Whose idea was that? 
 
A. Gil's. Someone in the prosecutor's office. I  don't know who 
specifically it was. 
 
Q. Did Gil Garcetti ever speak to you prior to that press conference 
about that press conference? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Did you speak to Gil Garcetti at all on that  day? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. What do you recall that conversation was about? 
 
A. Just my disbelief that the man who murdered my  brother got away 
with it. 
 
Q. You believe O.J. Simpson murdered your  brother? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. You have a lot of hate for him, don't you?  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Irrelevant. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: Goes to her bias. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: She is not a witness to any fact  involving Mr. 
Simpson's murder of Ron Goldman. Mr. Simpson was tried because all 
the evidence  pointed to him and nothing -- 
 
MR. P. BAKER: We don't need a speech. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: -- and no evidence points to any other person. So 
let's get on with it. I've let you go for a long time.    
 
MR. P. BAKER: I hope you've entertained your  clients. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I'm not entertaining my clients. 
 
You're asking Kim Goldman whether she has hatred for O.J. Simpson. 
It is about the most offensive, insensitive  question that I've ever heard 
a witness answer, and I'm surprised to hear it come from you.  I instruct 
you not to answer the question.  Move on, please. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. Ms. Goldman, on October 11th, 1995, there was  a press conference. 
When you looked at OJ. Simpson, you felt "Hate.  Absolute hate. Rage. 
Disgust Pain. Sadness." Do you recall that statement?      
 
A. Where was that coming from?  
 
Q. In a statement made to the L.A. Times on October 11th, 1995. Do 
you recall? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Do you want to continue to badger  the witness 
with these insensitive, offensive questions  that have absolutely no 
basis in relevancy? 
 
You explain to me how this could possibly lead to discoverable 
information. 
 
MR. P. BAKER:  Directly to bias of the witness. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Bias about what? 
 
MR. P. BAKER: Bias about her testimony. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Testimony about what? 
 
MR. P. BAKER: What I'm asking her. I am taking the deposition; 
you're not. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: How is her bias, if she had any, relevant to any 
issue in the case? 
 
MR. P. BAKER. May affect her answers. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The only issue -- 
 
MR. P. BAKER: Do you understand what bias is? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The only answer she can provide any relevant 
testimony on has to do with the relationship  between Fred Goldman 
and Ron Goldman and Sharon Rufo and  Ron Goldman, and that's 
about it . 
 
MR. P. BAKER: Apparently, you've been attending a  different 
deposition than what I've been attending. 
 
Q. Do you recall that conversation? Do you  recall that statement, Ms. 
Goldman? I'm sorry. It's on page 2 where the Post-it note  is. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I guess we'll  have to examine O.J.  Simpson 
about his offensive remarks concerning the Browns  and Goldmans, 
and I'll cite this examination as the basis  for that inquiry. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: These remarks are intended to be a  part of  the 
record because this deposition, like Mr. Simpson's, is going to get 
leaked. Is that why you're making the speeches? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's a ridiculous comment, and you know it is. 
You should be ashamed of yourself. In the words of Robert Baker "Act 
like a lawyer." Let's move on, please. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: I'm waiting for the answer. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes.  
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. And you do hate Mr. Simpson, true?   
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I instruct you not to answer the  question. It's 
irrelevant    
 
MR. P. BAKER: Mark it, please.  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It's offensive and it's insensitive  and it's 
irrelevant. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. Have you ever made a statement to any detective regarding any 
matter outside of this case? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Instruct the witness not to answer  on the ground 
of irrelevancy. By your own question, it's irrelevant. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: Are you instructing her not to answer on the grounds 
of relevancy? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You said, "outside this case." I  assume you mean 
the civil, not criminal. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: I understand you're -- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Your question asks for conversations with 
detectives having nothing to do with this case. I instruct her not to 
answer. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: | 
 
Q. Who did you know personally who testified at  trial prior to their 
testimony? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Who did she know prior to June 12, 1994, who 
testified at the trial? 
 
MR. P. BAKER: Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: If anyone. 
 
THE WITNESS: Patti. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. Anyone else? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: By "Patti" you are referring to Patti Goldman?   
 
THE WITNESS: Correct. No not that I can think of. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: There were over 100 witnesses, I think, but is that 
your best recollection? 
 
THE WITNESS:  Yes. 
 
 
MR. P. BAKER: Do you want to take a break so you can coach your 
witness outside the room?   
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  I don't need to coach the witness,  unlike other 
lawyers I know. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: Why don't we take about a 10-minute  break.  
 
(A recess is taken.) 
 
MR. P. BAKER: Just for the record, I'll attach the  articles as Exhibit 
1002, so it's clear what I referred to. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Why don't you describe it on the record.  
 
MR. P. BAKER: There's 3 computerized reproductions of L.A. Times 
articles, which should be attached.   
 
MR. BREWER We're marking those collectively as 1002?      
 
MR. P. BAKER: Right.  I have trial subpoenas. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Baker, you asked Ms. Goldman a  question 
about whether she hates OJ. Simpson, and I've  instructed her not to 
answer the question. And over my objections, she wishes to answer. So 
if you want to ask her, she will answer. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. What is your answer, ma'am? 
 
A. I absolutely hate the man. 
 
Q. You believe he killed your brother, true? 
 
A. Absolutely. 
 
Q. And you'll say anything to make sure he is found responsible for 
that death, true? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Who have you told of this hatred? 
 
A. Lots of people. I'm not ashamed of it 
 
Q. Who have you told was the question. 
 
A. Lots of people. 
 
Q. Do you have any names? 
 
A. My family; My friends. 
 
Q. Which friends? 
 
A. Would you like me to list all my friends? 
 
Q. Please. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He wants you to list the friends  that you've said 
this to. He doesn't want you to list all  your friends.  (The names and 
telephone numbers provided by the  witness have been stricken from 
the transcript per counsel present and written on a piece of paper to be 
marked as Exhibit 1003 and retained by Mr. P. Baker.) 
 
THE WITNESS: Are you going to be -- Is this going  to be out in 
public, these phone numbers? 
 
MR. P. BAKER: This is not going to be released from  our office. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, none of these depositions are  subject to a 
sealing order. And as you know, there are all sorts of lawyers,  
including 4 firms on your side, 3 firms on plaintiff's side, that have 
access to these depositions, not to mention  numerous other persons. 
 
So there's no assurance, Ms. Goldman, that these  depositions won't be 
made public. 
 
If you have a concern about that, I think we could  go back and take 
those names off and write them on a piece  of paper, as Mr. Baker has 
done in other depositions. We  can accommodate that. 
 
THE WITNESS: I would rather do that. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: We'll have the list attached. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Make this 1003. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 1003. We'll leave blanks for the numbers  already 
referred  to in the last 2  pages of deposition testimony, and she'll  write 
the names and the  phone numbers, and Exhibit 1003 will be placed in 
a Manila envelope in the back of the  deposition. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You know what I would suggest is  that you just 
hold onto that exhibit. Okay? Just don't make any copies of it, and you 
hold onto it, Mr. Baker, and we'll know the numbers. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. Why don't you place the numbers next to the names which you have 
referred to, the first one being [name deleted]. 
 
A. (Indicating.) 
 
Q. [Name deleted] was next. 
 
A. (Indicating.) 
 
Q. [Name deleted] was next 
 
A. (Indicating.) 
 
Q. [Name deleted] was next. 
 
A. (Indicating.) 
 
Q. [Name deleted.] 
 
A. (Indicating.) 
 
Q. And [name deleted]. 
 
A. (Indicating.) 
 
Q. You have told these persons that you hate  Mr. Simpson, true? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And you've told them that on many times, true? 
 
A. After all the evidence was shown, yes. I didn't know him before my 
brother's murder. I  would have no reason to hate him before that. 
 
Q. You didn't tell anyone you hated Mr. Simpson until all the evidence 
was shown?  
 
A. Until I believe he murdered my brother. 
 
Q. And that is until you analyzed all the evidence? 
 
A. At some point. 
 
Q. What point was that, ma'am? 
 
A. I don't know the exact day I believed in his  guilt. 
 
Q. Do you have an estimate as to when you believed in Mr. Simpson's 
guilt? 
 
A. Probably during the DNA, since that was the  most revealing and 
hurtful evidence towards him. 
 
Q. That's what you believe to be the most hurtful   evidence against 
him? 
 
A. Yes. Part of it.  There's a whole slew of pieces of evidence that show 
his guilt. 
 
Q. So you told these persons that you hated  Mr. Simpson following the 
DNA portion? 
 
A. I don't know specifically when I told him, but  probably at some 
point around there, yeah. 
 
Q. Prior to the time that the defense put on their case, true? 
 
A. I can't answer that. 
 
Q. When was the last time you told any one of these individuals that 
you hate Mr. Simpson? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Don't speculate. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know.  
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. You have no idea when the last time was? 
 
A. I don't know, no. 
 
Q. Was it recently? 
 
A. Probably. I don't know for sure. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Don't guess. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
Q. You attended Mr. Simpson's deposition, didn't you? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: She was excluded from Mr. Simpson's deposition 
by your law firm, so she was unable to attend.  
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. You held press conferences about that deposition, didn't you?    
 
MR. PETROCELLI: She did hold a press conference and  talked to the 
press assembled and amassed outside my  office. 
 
THE WITNESS: I was asked a question about that,  yes. 
 
MR. P. BAKER:  
Q. How many days of the week of Mr. Simpson's  deposition did you 
speak to the press? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What's the relevance of this,  Mr. Baker? 
 
MR. P. BAKER: I want to understand how she obtained  this 
knowledge about his deposition. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Why? I'm going to stop it here.  That's irrelevant. 
I'll instruct her not to answer.    
 
MR. P. BAKER: Again, you're  instructing her not to  answer on 
relevancy grounds; is that correct, sir? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes, Mr. Baker. And by "relevancy," it's a 
shorthand reference to  the longer form of objection that is not 
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
 
I also think, in all due respect, that you're  harassing the witness. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. Do you know if Mr. Goldman, Ron Goldman, ever -- Well, he was 
an aspiring actor, wasn't he? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Did he ever act? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Did he ever make any movies of any manner  whatsoever? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Never in any commercials? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. He didn't have a SAG card? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. You mentioned that your family had received donations since Mr. 
Simpson's acquittal.  What's the total amount of those donations? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Instruct you not to answer. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: On what grounds? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: On the grounds that it's irrelevant  and it's 
harassing. You know it is, too. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: Can you mark that, please. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Also invades privacy and a slew of  other 
objections. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. How often did you see Ron in the last 6 months  of his life?  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You already went through this, but  you can 
answer it again. 
 
THE  WITNESS: On 2 separate occasions for an  extended period of 
time. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. That was in April of '94, was one of those   occasions, true? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q.  What was the second occasion? 
 
A. Sometime in -- Oh, wait. More than 2 times. 
 
Q. One time in November when I came down for Lauren's bat mitzvah, 
I was there about a week and spent almost  everyday with my brother, 
November of '93. 
 
Q. How many days did you spend with him? 
 
A. I'd say 4 out of the 6 days that I was home. 
 
Q. What type of things did you do with him?  
 
A. Went shopping. We had lunch together. Hung out together. Ran 
errands. Brother and sisterly things.    
 
Q. Did you stay at his house or apartment?  
 
A. No. 
 
Q. You've heard reports that -- 
 
A. There was another time. 
 
Q. Okay. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: She's not completed.  
 
THE WITNESS: Sometime in December when we all got  together for 
the holidays; And my birthday; And my dad's birthday when I came 
down for another length of time; As well as the time in April. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 
 
Q. There have been tabloid stories about every  party involved in this 
case including your brother. You're aware of that, true? 
         
A. I've heard about them, yes.  
 
Q. You've heard the tabloid stories that he was involved in drugs.  Do 
you have any knowledge of that?  
 
A. Absolutely not, he was not involved in drugs.  
 
Q. And you'd never seen him use any drugs? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Did you find any prescription drugs in his  apartment when you 
cleaned it out? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Do you know how many pages your journal is that you prepared 
during the criminal trial? 
 
A. As many days as the criminal trial existed, a year, 9 months, 
whatever it was. 
 
Q. Each day you had a journal entry? 
 
A. For the most part, yes.  
 
Q. And have you had journal entries since the  conclusion of the 
criminal trial on October 3rd? 
 
A. Off and on, just what may have  happened that  day. 
 
Q. Any journal entries about the civil lawsuit? 
 
A. A few, yes. 
 
Q. In 1992 when Ron was arrested, did you ever see your father and 
Ron get in an argument? 
 
A. My dad didn't know at first.  I told my father.  I don't -- They didn't 
get into an argument about it.   
 
Q. How did you learn about it? 
 
A. My brother called me from jail. 
 
Q. Did he want you to bail him out? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Did he just advise where he was? 
 
A. He told me where he was. He thought he was going to be released 
later.  I offered to come help him.  And he wanted to take care of it on 
his own, so he decided to stay, so that nobody would have to pay for 
him. 
 
Q. And as you sit here today, you can't recall why he was arrested 
specifically? 
 
A. I believe it was parking citations, traffic violations, things of that 
nature. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: I've got no further questions.  Mr. Brewer, do you 
have any questions? 
 
MR. BREWER: No questions. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: Propose the stipulation that the deposition be sent to 
Mr. Petrocelli's office.  It's about 143 pages, so 15 days, 20 days to 
review the deposition transcript.  Make any changes and then sign. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  20 is fine. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 20 days. And Mr. Petrocelli will advise me if there 
are any changes made to that deposition testimony.  And also propose 
that we stipulate that if the original is lost, a copy can be used in its 
stead. 
 
MR. BREWER: So stipulated. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: So stipulated. ]

A. No.

Q. That would be - 
 
A. Wife and stepchildren.  
 
Q. Your wife's name is? 
 
A. Patti. 
 
Q. And when is the last time, to your knowledge, that Ron saw Sharon 
Rufo? 
 
A. About 13 or 14 years prior to his death. 
 
Q. Do you have any knowledge as to when he might have last spoken 
to Sharon Rufo? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Don't speculate. If you know, you can answer. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. Or if you've heard. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's what I mean by "no," if you've heard any 
information. 
 
THE WITNESS: I understood it was about 2 years prior, 2 or 3 years 
prior. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. From whom did you hear this? 
 
A. Ron. 
 
Q. Did he tell you the nature of their communication, what they talked 
about or the purpose? 
 
A. Told me of the conversation or of the call. 
 
Q. It was a phone call? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. What did he tell you about? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The two of you are starting to talk over each other 
a little bit, and both of you need to wait for the other to finish. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. What did he tell you about it? 
 
A. He said that he had called; And that a man answered the phone. Ron 
asked for Sharon. The person answering the phone indicated, "Who are 
you?" Ron said, "Ron." "Ron who?" Ron said, "Ron, her son." And he 
ultimately left a message. 
 
Q. With Sharon Rufo or with this man? 
 
A. The man that turned out to be her husband. 
 
Q. What was the message? 
 
A. He called. 
 
Q. Did he ever speak directly with her? 
 
A. I believe he did the following day, yes. 
 
Q. Did he tell you what was discussed in that conversation? 
 
A. Just that it was a short conversation; That he wasn't aware that she 
was married; And there was nothing specific about it, just that it was a 
short conversation. 
 
Q. Did he tell you why he called her? 
 
A. Yes. He just said that he had decided to call and see what was going 
on because he hadn't talked to her in a while. 
 
Q. Did he say anything about calling her for money? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Can you remember anything that was specifically mentioned by Ron 
that they talked about in this phone call? 
 
A. I think it was probably, as I recall, just a bit - as it turned out, a 
rehashing of old stuff. 
 
Q. How would you characterize Ron's feelings about his mother as of, 
say, the time of his death, if you know? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: When you say "characterize," you're asking him 
to answer if - 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: I'll rephrase it. 
 
Q. To your knowledge, did Ron love his mother? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did he respect her? 
 
A. I think the answer would be no. 
 
Q. Did he have any ill feelings towards her because of the 
circumstances of how she left his life?  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Are your questions posed with reference to the 
time at or near Ron's death? 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Do you understand that, Mr. Goldman? 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes and no. 
 
I guess the question is, when you say - Maybe you can rephrase it; 
maybe I'll understand it better. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. I want to know, let's say, in the month before Ron died, a third party 
came to you and said, "How would you characterize Ron's feelings 
about his mother?" What would you have said to him? 
 
A. I would have said that Ron loves her, but hardly ever talks to her 
and doesn't have a relationship. 
 
Q. Did Ron ever express feelings to you that he felt that she abandoned 
him? 
 
A. I don't think it was - I don't know that it was in those words, 
"abandoned," but I think it was more in terms of just didn't maintain a 
relationship. I don't think '"abandoned" would have been the word that 
would have been used. 
 
Q. How about "deserted"? 
 
A. No, I don't think "deserted" either. 
 
Q. To your knowledge, were there any cards or letters that were sent by 
Mrs. Rufo to Ron during the 13-year period that he didn't see her? 
 
A. I think there were occasional but rare. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: When you say "during the 13-year period that he 
didn't see her," his testimony was that was the last time they saw each 
other. He didn't have reference to Ron's entire life. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. Just the last 13 years after she left his life, as it were, did she send 
birthday cards, to your knowledge?  
 
A. Very rare. When they showed up, it was a topic of conversation. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I also want to object to the question on the 
grounds that the statement, "after she left his life," is not consistent 
with his testimony. 
 
The only point about 13 years ago was that is the last time he thinks 
that Ron saw Sharon. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: I heard the same thing you did. 
 
Q. If my questions are unclear, please don't answer them.  
 
To your knowledge, did she ever send presents to Ron?  
 
A. Not that I'm aware of, no. 
 
Q. Did she ever send any money to him? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Did she, to your knowledge, support him in any way? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Did he support her in any way? 
 
A. No. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Financially?  
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN:  
 
Q. Financially. 
 
To your knowledge, did he ever write her any cards or letters?  
 
A. I think a few.  
 
Q. Do you know what the circumstances were? 
 
A. I think it was just several times over the years, Ron just decided to 
attempt to have some contact again. 
 
Q. Have you ever seen any of these cards or letters?  
 
A. I think I did at the time they were written. 
 
Q. How did you see them? Did he show them to you?  
 
A. He showed them to me.  
 
Q. Did you read them before they were sent?  
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And this was a period of time when he was living with you?  
 
A. Oh, yeah.  
 
Q. Did he ever get responses back to these cards or letters?  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: If you know.  
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN:  
 
Q. To your knowledge. 
 
A. I can't tell you that I'm 100 percent sure. May have. I'm not sure. 
 
Q. Did he - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: 1 second. (Witness and his counsel confer off the 
record.) 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. He was in no way financially supporting her, was he? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. When have you last spoken with her? 
 
A. Last time I spoke to her was a day or two after Ron's death. 
 
Q. Since then, you've not had any communication with her? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Can you tell me generally what it was you spoke about? 
 
A. Burial arrangements. 
 
Q. Was she in St. Louis when you had this conversation? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did she go to the funeral? 
 
A. Pardon me? 
 
Q. Did she go to the funeral? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did she contribute financially towards any of the funeral or burial 
costs? 
 
A. Pardon me? 
 
Q. Did you pay for those? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Can you tell me approximately what the total amount of money 
was? 
 
A. My recollection was somewhere in the 6 - or $7,000. 
 
Q. Where is Ron? Is he buried? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Where? 
 
A. An Agoura cemetery. 
 
Q. Is this a family plot? 
 
A. I guess, to some degree, it's sort of become one. It wasn't then. 
 
Q. Is he there by himself? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Now, you were here for the entirety of your daughter's deposition 
which was taken, I guess, last Monday, correct? 
 
A. Correct.  
 
Q. To your recollection and knowledge did she say anything that you 
had a strong disagreement with in terms of accuracy?  
 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Object to the question on the grounds that it is 
necessarily compound, overbroad, vague and ambiguous, and lacks 
foundation. 
 
If there's something that comes to mind, you can answer. 
 
THE WITNESS: Nothing that comes to mind. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. So you don't recall hearing anything regarding, say, the cleaning out 
of, Ron's apartment or some specific factual things that she talked 
about that you disagreed with factually? 
 
A. Disagreed with, major, no; minor little things, but just a perception 
issue. 
 
Q. Do you have any knowledge as to whether his wallet was ever 
retrieved by either the police or you or Kim? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Assuming he had one. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: I don't, know. Maybe he didn't have one.  
 
Q. Did he carry a wallet? 
 
A. I can't tell you I remember specifically a wallet, but I know there 
was ID cards and things like that that ultimately I did get back from the 
coroner's office. 
 
Q. Did he carry, say, a money clip or a wallet or some kind of a thing 
that men stick in their pockets to hold their cards? 
 
A. He did not carry a money clip.  
 
Q. What was it that you got back from the coroner that you understand 
was on his person when he was killed?  
 
A. Photo ID; Some keys; I think a watch, but - No, wasn't a watch. 
That's all I can recall. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Before you, answer - 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't recall anything else. 
 
(Witness and his counsel confer off the record.) 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN:  
 
Q. You have these items? 
 
A. Yes.  
 
Q. Where are they?  
 
A. My home.  
 
Q. And you'll preserve those for us in the event that they're needed in 
this case? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. How much money, if any, was returned to you? 
 
A. From - 
 
Q. From the coroner's office that you understood to be on his 
possession when he was killed. 
 
A. I can't honestly remember. 
 
Q. Was it a large amount of money, over $100? 
 
A. No, no. I don't recall that there was specifically any - one way or 
another whether there was or wasn't - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: - money? 
 
THE WITNESS: Right, money. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: - any, money? 
 
THE WITNESS: Right. 
  
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. To your knowledge, Ron did not have a driver's license at the time 
he was killed, correct?  
 
A. That's correct. 
 
Q. And to your knowledge, it had been suspended by the DMV; is that 
accurate? , 
 
A. I think so, although I think it was suspended, but I'm not 100 
percent sure. What's the basis for your thinking it was suspended?  
 
Q. I just remembered that it had been, but I can't tell you that I 
remember it was reinstated yet or not. 
 
Q. Did you become aware of the suspension at the time it occurred, , if 
you remember? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did Ron tell you about it? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Were you aware of the arrests that Kim talked about last Monday 
that involved Ron? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: At the time the arrest occurred or at any time? 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. Well, did you become aware of them at any time? And if so, when? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. When did you become aware of them? 
 
A. The first one, when Ron was arrested, he called me. And the second 
one, after the fact. 
 
Q. When he called you, what did he say? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: First one? 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: Yes. 
 
THE WITNESS: Said he'd been arrested in a traffic violation and that 
he was at the jail, and I told him I would come and pick him up. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. Did you bail him out? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Do you remember what the bail was? 
 
A. No, I don't 
 
Q. The second time he got arrested, he didn't call you; is that true? 
 
A. That's correct. 
 
Q. Are you aware of how much time he spent in custody for that arrest?  
 
A. After the fact, I think it was 4 days, I believe. 
 
Q. Are you aware of any other arrests involving Ron other than those 
2? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Have you ever been a plaintiff in any other lawsuits other than this? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. You've never been in any auto accidents which ultimately ended up 
in the filing of a lawsuit? 
 
A. Involved in auto accidents, but there was no, quote, unquote, 
"lawsuit." 
 
Q. Have you made any claims against other parties in connection with 
auto accidents that you've been involved in? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: This is irrelevant. You may answer anyway. 
 
THE WITNESS: Claims against - 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: Yes. 
 
THE WITNESS: We were involved in a very bad automobile accident 
years ago, and I - No, there was no claim against anyone else. 
Ultimately, the insurance companies - 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. Were you paid a settlement in that case by the other party? 
 
A. Yes. Paid to my daughter. 
 
Q. By the other party's insurance? 
 
A. It was by my insurance company because the other party didn't have 
any insurance. 
 
Q. Did you personally pay anything?  
 
A. No. 
 
Q. When you say "We were involved in a...bad accident, " you mean 
you and Kim? 
 
A. Myself; My wife, Patti; Ron; And Kim. 
 
Q. Was Kim the only one who received any compensation as a result of 
the accident? 
 
A. Yes, compensation, yes. 
 
Q. And the other party uninsured? 
 
A. It was either uninsured or had minor insurance, $10,000, if I 
remember right. 
 
Q. When you first heard Ron was killed, did anything come to mind as 
to who may have killed him? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Was it ever suggested to you by anyone at any time before Ron's 
funeral that O.J. Simpson had killed him? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Before Ron's funeral? 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Including media reports? 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. Anybody. 
 
A. I think by that time, there was information in the media that police 
were talking to him, but I don't recall anything more than that. 
 
Q. Has anybody ever come to you or called you or written you and 
said, "I killed Ron Goldman" other than O.J. Simpson? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. So nobody has, let's say, confessed to the killing to you? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Have you heard from third parties that they believed somebody 
other than O.J. Simpson may have killed Ron? 
 
MR. BREWER: Objection to the term "third parties." It's vague and 
ambiguous. 
 
(The witness and his counsel confer off the record.) 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. In other words, has anybody come up j to you and said, "I know 
who killed" - 
 
A. No. Never done that. 
 
Q. - or "I think I know who killed Ron and Nicole"? 
 
A. No 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Other than O.J. Simpson. 
 
THE WITNESS: No one has come up to me and said that, no. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. Have you ever spoken with O.J. Simpson?  
 
A. No.  
 
Q. When was the first time that you can recall ever saying to somebody 
that you believed O.J. Simpson killed your son? 
 
A. My guess is it would have been somewhere into the trial.  
 
Q. Can you, without guessing, tell us approximately when that was? 
 
A. Sometime when the evidence started piling up if you would.  
 
Q. I take it, you obviously disagreed with the jury and their verdict?  
 
A. Completely. 
 
Q. Have you ever spoken to any of the jurors? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Have you ever attempted to speak to any of them? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: This is all irrelevant. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. To your knowledge, was Ron in debt to anybody at the time of his 
death? 
 
MR. BREWER: Before you answer that. that's vague and ambiguous 
with respect to "debt to 
anyone." 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. Did he owe anybody any money, as far as you know? 
 
A. Not that I'm aware of at that point, no. 
 
Q. Have you personally paid any claims made by any individuals or 
institutions, banks, on behalf of Ron since he died? 
 
A. After his death? 
 
Q. Yes. 
 
A. There may have been a bill or two that showed up that I may have 
paid, but I can't tell you specifically remember any specific one. 
  
MR. PETROCELLI: When you say "a bill," you mean like a utility 
bill? 
  
THE WITNESS: Yes. Because I had all his mail forwarded to my 
home; and if there were utility bills or anything, I would have paid 
them. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. And he was renting the apartment he was in?  
 
A. Yes.  
 
Q. Was it on a month-to-month basis, to your knowledge?  
 
Q. Yes. Do you remember what the amount of the rent was?  
 
A. No, I don't.  
 
Q. In the last 5 years before he died, did, you provide any financial 
support to him? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. How much?  
 
A. I don't know that I could put a dollar figure on it, but it was a little 
money here and there.  
 
Q. You are going to have to tell me what you mean by "a little money 
here and there." Mr. Petrocelli is a very wealthy man, and his idea of -- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let the record reflect howling laughter by me. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN:  
 
Q. How much would you say you contributed, let's say, every 6 months 
in the 5 years before he died? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Assuming you could do it that way. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know that I could put a number on it because - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I think what he wants to know, is it like in the 
thousands or hundreds, you know, some ballpark. 
 
THE WITNESS: Over a 5-year period, probably several thousand. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: Would he call occasionally and ask you for 
money?  
 
A. No. More me just doing it. 
 
Q. And were you aware of his filing bankruptcy in 1992? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did you offer before he did that to help him with any of his 
financial obligations? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did he accept the offer? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. And did you, in fact, help him? 
 
A. I helped him in the sense of going to a financial planner and trying 
to work out payment of his bills. 
 
Q. Did you personally contribute towards the payment of the bills that 
he owed at the time he went to the financial planner? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. And when he filed bankruptcy, did he discuss with you the fact that 
he was going to do that? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Did you try to talk him out of it? 
 
A. Initially, when we - when there was the conversation that ultimately 
resulted in seeing a financial planner, we had talked about not going 
through bankruptcy and attempting to take care of his debts. 
 
Q. When did Ron last live in the same house with you? 
 
A. Year, year and a half or so prior to his death. 
 
Q. And after he left the house, how often would you say that you saw 
him? 
 
A. Oh, at least once a week. 
 
Q. Would he come up to your house, and would that be generally how 
it was - 
 
A. It was typically either/or. Sometimes we met for lunch. Sometimes 
dinner. Sometimes he came to the house. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: 1 second. 
 
(Witness and his counsel confer off the record.) 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. How would you characterize your relationship with Ron in the last 
year and a half of his life in terms of whether you were close, best 
friends? You can use any words you want. 
 
A. Very close, best friends, all of the above. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You should describe yourself a little more than - 
 
THE WITNESS: We always had a close relationship, and it never 
changed, whether he was living at home or not living at home. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN:  
 
Q. Did he ever anger you?  
 
A. Sure. 
 
Q. Did you ever anger him, to your knowledge? 
 
A. Sure.  
 
Q. Just generally, what sort of things angered you about Ron?  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Van Sicklen, are you talking about that last 
year and a half still?  
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: Yes.  
 
THE WITNESS: I think it was typical father-son stuff. My wanting 
Ron to push for the best, issues like that; but it was never anything over 
anything that I would consider ultimately serious.

where Ron was going that night after he left work?  
 
A. Yes.  
 
Q. With whom have you spoken? 
 
A. Name slips me at the moment, but one of the people he worked with 
at Mezzaluna. 
 
Q. Can you tell me what that person said to you? 
 
A. Yeah. That they were going to be meeting later that evening after 
Ron got off of work; or after they both got off of work, they were 
going to be meeting later. 
 
Q. Where? 
 
A. My recollection was either it was a dance club someplace - 
 
Q. Did he have any knowledge about the circumstances of Nicole's 
mother's glasses? 
 
A. It was that Ron had offered to return the glasses that had been left or 
lost at the restaurant. 
 
Q. And did he say to you that he heard Ron say that he would take the 
glasses over to Nicole's house? 
 
A. I don't know that he said that he heard he would do it or that he was 
told, that he was doing it. I don't recall which. 
 
Q. Did he tell you what time he expected to meet Ron? 
 
A. I'm going to tell you, I think it was 11:00-plus, but I'm not 100 
percent sure. 
 
Q. Can you remember - I think I asked you - where it was that they 
expected to meet each other? 
 
A. I think it was a dance club, but I'm not 100 percent sure. 
 
Q. Was it somewhere, to your knowledge, within walking distance of 
Ron's apartment? 
 
A. I don't know. 
 
Q. Did he say anything about how Ron was to get there? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Did he say anything about whether there were to be other people at 
the club later other than Ron and whoever this person was?

what relationship, if any, he had with Nicole Simpson before he died? 
 
A. Over all this time, it's been mentioned to me, yes.  
 
Q. With whom have you spoken?  
 
A. Various friends of Ron's that he worked with primarily or that knew 
Ron.  
 
Q. Can you give me any names?  
 
A. A couple people that he worked with at Mezzaluna. I'm horrible 
with names. I can't tell you that I remember the names. 
 
Q. Can you tell me generally what the relationship was described as 
being? 
 
A. Friends. 
  
Q. Has anybody told you that they were ever intimate? 
 
A. No, never. 
 
Q. Has anybody told you they were not intimate? 
 
A. Told me they were friends only. 
 
Q. Did anybody tell you that he had been - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: 1 second. I want to make sure.  
(Witness and his counsel confer off the record.)  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I'd tike you, to repeat the prior t question because 
it went by quickly, and I'm not sure the witness understood it. 
 
(The record is read by the reporter.) 
 
THE WITNESS: Told me they were friends, and people had also said, 
in fact, they had not been. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. So to your knowledge, Ron had never told anybody that he had been 
intimate with Nicole Simpson? . 
 
A. Correct. 
 
Q. Did anybody tell you that Ron had spent time at Nicole Simpson's 
house?  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Vague and I ambiguous. You can answer. 
 
THE WITNESS: No one told me that. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN:  
 
Q. Did anybody tell you that Ron had driven her car? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. Who told you that? 
 
A. Again, it's a blur at that time, but someone had told me he had 
driven the car. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: By "that time," you mean after Ron's death? | 
 
THE WITNESS: After Ron's death, sure. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN:  
 
Q. Did this person or persons tell you how frequently he had driven her 
car?  
 
A. I only heard that he had driven it once.  
 
Q. Do you have any knowledge as to whether he was in her car - I'm 
speaking about the Ferrari with the license plate, L84AD8, on June 12, 
1994. 
 
A. No one told me that 
 
Q. To your knowledge, did he wait on Nicole Simpson that night? 
 
A. No, he did not. 
 
Q. When you retrieved his notebook which had the specials for the 
menu specials that night, were there any receipts or tabs that he had 
reflecting the orders he took that night? 
 
A. I don't believe so, no. As a matter of fact, there weren't.  
 
Q. To your knowledge, other than yourself, who do you believe Ron 
would have said was his best friend? 
 
A. Might have said his sister; but other than that, it would have been 
[Names Deleted]. 
 
Q. How would you have characterized, let's say, in the month before 
Ron died, to a third party who asked, how would you characterize Kim 
and Ron's relationship? 
 
A. Incredibly close.  
 
Q. Did they ever fight, argue, I mean? 
 
A. As brother and sister, yes. 
 
Q. Did Ron ever, to your knowledge, undergo any professional 
counseling, psychological counseling?  
 
A. As an adult? 
 
Q. Yes. 
 
A. I don't believe so.  
 
(Witness and his counsel confer off the record.) 
 
THE WITNESS: That's why I asked the question, "As an adult?" 
 
When Ron and Kim were young, the answer is yes. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: Did he undergo any counseling because of the 
circumstances surrounding the lack of relationship with their natural 
mother? 
 
A. Yes. The three of us went to counseling together. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Three of you being who? 
 
THE WITNESS: Ron, Kim, and I. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. About when was that? 
 
A. Oh, anywhere from the time Ron was 6, Kim was 3 on. 
 
Q. Was it any particular counselor? Can you give me a name? 
 
A. Was a particular counselor, and I can't think of her name right now. 
A lot of years ago. 
 
Q. In the Agoura area? 
 
A. Oh, no. This would have been in Chicago. 
 
Q. Are you making any claims for lost income in this case? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Instruct you not to answer. He's here to give facts 
and information, not - 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: I just want to know if there's a claim for lost 
earnings. 
 
Q. Are you claiming you've lost any income as a result of the death of 
your son? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Did he? You can ask him, did he. Don't ask him if 
he's making a claim. Do you want me to cite back the eloquent words 
of Robert Baker? 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: I don't need any more speeches. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I instruct him - 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. Do you believe you have lost any income as a result of your son's 
death? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You can answer that question. 
 
THE WITNESS: The answer is yes. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. What's the basis for the belief? 
 
A. I have over this past year and a half simply, because of the time 
constraints, not worked as often and probably haven't been able to have 
my mind as much on work as typically. Those kinds of issues. 
 
Q. Is there a dollar amount that you can give me that you feel that you 
have lost as a result of the death of your son? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I'm not going to let him answer the question 
because we're not seeking any such income, lost income. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: That's a stipulation? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: So stipulated. 
 
MR. BREWER: Stipulation by law. It's a wrongful death case. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: In any event, Mr. Brewer is absolutely right, that 
is the law; but we're not seeking it, in any event. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN:  
 
Q. It's not your intention to ask the jury in this case, or the finder of 
fact, to award lost income as a result of Ron Goldman death? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Correct. Lost income to Mr. Goldman? 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Correct. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. In terms of your son's future plans in life, were they consistent with 
what Kim said? Was his dream to build a restaurant and run a 
restaurant? 
 
A. Yes, it was. 
 
Q. To your knowledge, did he, at the time of his death, have anybody 
who was financially willing to back him in such a project? 
 
A. From several conversations that I had had with Ron, he had told me 
there were some people interested in helping financially. It was in the 
same conversation that we had in which he asked me if I would be 
interested. 
 
Q. What did you say? 
 
A. The answer was "Yes, probably; but when you have more 
information, we'll talk further." 
 
Q. When was this conversation in relation to his death? 
 
A. 6, 9 months prior. Probably 9 months prior. 
 
Q. Did he offer or have a name for this restaurant?  
 
A. I don't - I know there was conversation about what he was going to 
call it, but my recollection is he said he didn't want to give it a name. 
He wanted to give it an image, and the image had something to do with 
an ankh, the Egyptian sign for life, peace, et cetera. 
 
Q. Can you spell ankh for me? 
 
A. A-n-k-h, I believe. 
 
Q. Have you ever spoken with Kato Kaelin? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Have you ever spoken with Faye Resnick? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Have you ever - 
 
A. Wait. That's not true. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me.  
 
(Witness and his counsel confer off the record.)  
 
THE WITNESS: That's not true. We did talk for a few minutes.  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Slow down just a little bit. He shifted gears very 
quickly on you. It's an old lawyer's trick. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. It's not a trick at all. You answer the question; I ask you the next 
question. 
 
A. The answer is yes.  
 
Q. That's Faye Resnick? 
 
A. Faye Resnick. 
 
Q. When did you speak with her? 
 
A. At a fund-raiser. 
 
Q. What type of fund-raiser? 
 
A. There was some people that held a fund-raiser for the Ron Goldman 
Justice Fund. 
 
Q. What is the Ron Goldman Justice Fund. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I'll instruct you not to answer. You're not going to 
inquire about the justice fund, which I will state for the record is a fund 
to assist in the prosecution of this lawsuit; and beyond that, you're not 
entitled to anything. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. Well, let me ask this: Who started the fund? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Instruct you not to answer. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. Who formed the fund? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Invades privacy, work product, attorney-client 
privilege. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. What did Faye Resnick and you talk about at this fund-raiser? 
 
A. I don't believe it was truly a, quote, unquote, "conversation." It was 
more just, "Hello, nice meeting you. Thank you for being here." It 
wasn't a lengthy conversation. It was really nothing more than a few 
words. 
 
Q. Did she get into any of the details of her relationship with Nicole? 
 
A. None. 
 
Q. Did she say anything about whether she had known Ron? 
 
A. No conversation about that. 
 
Q. To your knowledge, from any source other than your lawyers, did 
she know, Faye Resnick, know Ron? 
 
A. To my knowledge, the answer is no. 
 
Q. Did you have any conversation with any of the police officers that 
investigated, not the detectives, but the police officers that investigated 
the circumstances of the murders on June 14th --  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: June 12th. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: I'm sorry. June 12th. 
 
A. When you say "the police officers," meaning - 
 
Q. Have you had any personal conversations with any of the officers 
that were at the scene of the murders that morning? 
 
A. Do you mean other than people like Vannatter and Lange? 
 
Q. Yes. 
 
A. No, did not. 
 
Q. Have you had any conversations with - 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me. 
 
(Witness and his counsel confer off the record.) 
 
THE WITNESS: Well, to clarify, in terms of the police officers that 
investigated the murders? 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: Yes. 
 
THE WITNESS: Other than Lange and Vannatter, no. But I did have 
conversation with some other officers. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. With the LAPD -- 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q. - who were not involved in the investigation? 
 
A. Indirectly. They were Officers Tippin and Carr that were assigned 
to, I guess check on Ron's whereabouts, et cetera. 
 
Q. Did they ever tell you anything about the circumstances of whether 
there were ever 2 gloves at the scene of the murders?  
 
A. Who are we talking about now?  
 
Q. Tippin and Carr, the 2 police officers you just named.  
 
A. No, I don't believe so. No, I don't believe they ever discussed that 
whole issue at all. 
 
Q. Did you ever discuss that issue with either Detective Lange or 
Vannatter? 
 
A. I believe so.  
 
Q. Can you tell me what was said on the subject of the gloves? 
 
A. That there was one found at the scene. 
 
Q. Did you ever ask either of them whether they believe that Detective 
Fuhrman planted the glove that was found in Mr. Simpson's house? 
 
A. Did I ever ask them? 
 
Q. Yes. 
 
A. I might have. 
 
Q. What did they say? 
 
A. They didn't believe - They did not believe it at all. 
 
Q. Did they give you reasons why they didn't believe it?  
 
A. No, I don't think that they gave - don't believe there was any 
discussion about reasons why, no.  
 
Q. Did they ever tell you that they felt that Mr. Simpson came back 
from the scene of the murders and got onto his property by climbing 
the fence at or near the location where the glove was found? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The questions is, did Vannatter and Lange ever 
tell you that? 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN:  
 
Q. That is, that was their belief. 
 
A. I don't think so. 
 
Q. Did they ever discuss how he reentered his property that night? 
 
A. I don't believe so. 
 
Q. Have you ever discussed with them the whereabouts of any missing 
blood that was taken from Mr. Simpson? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Have you ever discussed the details of their belief that Mr. Simpson 
committed these crimes, other than what they have testified to at trial? 
 
A. Other than what they testified to at trial, no. 
 
Q. You don't have any personal knowledge in conversations with them 
over and above what they have publicly testified to about their beliefs 
or impressions regarding the guilt or innocence of Mr. Simpson? 
 
MR. BREWER: I'll object to that question as vague and ambiguous. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: They testified as to facts, not belief. The question 
is, do you know anything more than what they said on the stand? 
 
THE WITNESS: Nothing more than what they said on the stand, no. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: Were you able to identify the keys that were 
returned to you from the coroner's office that were found with Ron at 
the scene? 
 
A. Identify them in the sense of - 
 
Q. Apartment key, work key? Do you know what locks they fit? 
 
A. They weren't apartment keys. My recollection is, one of them was 
an old key off his jeep. I think there were some old keys; A house key 
on it from our house, my house.  
 
Q. Have you provided any photographs of Mr. Goldman to the police 
other than those that Kim talked about?  
 
A. Other than the ones Kim mentioned, no. That's not true. Not to the 
police. To the D.A.'s office, we later provided another photo of Ron.  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It was true, because the question was directed to 
the police, but you've amplified.  
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN:  
 
Q. Have you ever been offered money to write about the circumstances 
of your relationship with Ron? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Has any newspaper or tabloid approached you with offers of money 
to discuss the facts of the case? 
 
A. There was a tabloid recently that showed up at our door - I did not 
personally talk to them - that said they're willing to pay, I don't know, 
some amount of money for something. And the answer was no and 
goodbye. 
 
Q. Do you remember how much was offered? 
 
A. No, I don't 
 
Q. You have no plans to write a book or anything about the 
circumstances of the events of this case, do you? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It's irrelevant. You can answer. 
 
THE WITNESS: I guess the answer to that would be, it's a possibility. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. Have you discussed it with publishers? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Have you discussed it with anybody? 
 
A. We've talked about it as a family. Talked about it with - I guess we'll 
call it a book agent or representative. 
 
Q. Did you know Brett [Name Deleted]? 
 
A. I don't recognize the name. Doesn't ring a bell. 
 
Q. Did you know Mike [Name Deleted]? 
 
A. A friend of Ron's. 
 
Q. And do you have any recollection as to how much your son had in 
the way of either checking or savings accounts at the time of his death? 
 
A. How much or how many? 
 
Q. How much? 
 
A. I know he had a checking account. I don't recall. I don't believe he 
had a savings account.  
 
Q. And to your knowledge, Ron had never been married? 
 
A. Had not been married. 
 
Q. And had no children? 
 
A. Correct. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: Let's take a break for a second. 
 
(A recess is taken.) 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. Other than the fund that you discussed, have you made any money 
resulting from the death of Ron and Nicole?  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I object to the characterization that he made 
money through the fund. But the question, you can answer. Have you 
made any money? 
 
THE WITNESS: Haven't made any money. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. Do you recall the name of the doctor that treated Ron when he 
would go to the doctor? 
 
A. I believe it was Jon Matthew. 
 
Q. Where is he located? 
 
A. Dr. Jon Matthew, in Agoura. 
 
Q. Is he a Kaiser doctor? 
 
A. No. Private physician. 
 
Q. Just a family doctor? 
 
A. Correct. 
 
Q. And who, to your knowledge, were Ron's roommates in the 
apartment he lived in? 
 
A. In - 
 
Q. Before he died. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: If he had any. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. If you know. 
 
A. The last apartment he was in? 
 
Q. Yes. 
 
A. Short while, it was his girlfriend, Jacqui [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q. How many times were you over at that apartment?  
 
A. I guess the answer would have been dozens.  
 
Q. Did you have a key?  
 
A. No.  
 
Q. Can you tell me, other than your lawyers, names of people that you 
have had conversations with about the progress of this civil lawsuit? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: If anyone.  
 
THE WITNESS: I guess the best answer to that would be, never been 
conversations in detail because there aren't details at the moment. But 
close personal friends only. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. Can you name any of them? 
 
A[Names Deleted]. 
 
Q. You were present for some of Mr. Simpson's deposition testimony, 
correct? 
 
A. Correct.  
 
Q. Have you ever told anybody or expressed an opinion to anybody, 
other than lawyers, your lawyers, that you felt at any time in the 
deposition that he was lying? 
 
A. Yeah, I probably did. 
 
Q. To whom? 
 
A. Same group of friends. 
 
Q. And what did you say? 
 
A. I think I said that I felt, based on various things that were said, that I 
felt he was lying. 
 
Q. About what? 
 
A. I don't know that I could pinpoint one specific thing, but - 
 
Q. What do you think that he lied about in his deposition? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's irrelevant, his state of mind about Mr. 
Simpson's lies. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN:  
 
Q. What was the basis for your statement to other people that you felt 
he was lying?  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You can, answer what you said if you can recall. 
Beyond that, it's not necessary.  
 
THE WITNESS: I think it was relative to contradictions of testimony 
in the trial versus what he was saying. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. What contradictions? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What did you say, if anything, about that subject? 
 
THE WITNESS: Issues relative to why didn't he answer the limo 
driver's call, et cetera. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN:  
 
Q. Well, "et cetera"?  
 
A. That whole area of discussion was still what he was doing and why 
he didn't answer. 
 
Q. Have you kept any notes, journals, diaries, anything - 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. - like that - 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. - regarding the case? 
 
A. No.  
 
Q. And you mentioned that Kim, you felt there was some, in your 
mind, minor inconsistencies with Kim's deposition last Monday 
regarding the details of cleaning up his apartment. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I don't think he said ''inconsistencies.'' 
 
THE WITNESS: I didn't say "inconsistencies." I said minor detail 
differences. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN:  
 
Q. Such as? 
 
A. As an example, when Kim made reference of when we met the 
police at Ron's apartment, more accurately, the landlady was there. She 
opened the door. The police went in first. We were asked to wait until 
they went into the apartment first. And then we stood in the doorway 
and we came in. 
 
Q. There weren't any weapons found in his apartment? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Was anything in his apartment found that had Nicole Simpson's 
name on it or in it? 
 
A. I think the only thing I can recall that had her name in it was Ron's 
electronic address book. 
 
Q. Anything found with Faye Resnick's name in it? 
 
A. Not that I recall, no. 
 
Q. Kato Kaelin? 
 
A. No. 
 
Q. Did Ron ever tell you at any time that he knew the ex-wife of a 
celebrity which you know or said anything to you that he knew 
somebody that you later figured out to be Nicole Simpson? 
 
A. No, he didn't 
 
Q. Did Ron have hobbies like golf? We know he played tennis. 
 
A. Tennis. 
 
Q. Anything else? 
 
A. Tennis was his big love. 
 
Q. Can you tell me generally how your life has changed as a result of 
his death? 
 
A. Other than not having my son - 
 
Q. We can break at any time. 
 
A. It's okay. 
 
Q. This is my last question. 
 
A. There isn't anything in my life that hasn't changed since his death. 
 
Q. Everything?  
 
A. Every single, solitary moment of my life has changed.  
 
Q. What things did you do that you don't do now as a result of the 
impact of his death on you?  
 
A. I'm sorry. Say that again. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Other than the loss of his entire relationship with 
his son? 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. I'm speaking about, has your life changed in terms of worship, 
traveling, work, hobbies that you engage in? I want to know what it is 
when you're asked that question at trial, how has your life changed. 
what it is you're going to tell the jury. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Apart from your relationship you had with Ron of 
course, other things in your life. 
 
THE WITNESS: Things, I guess that come to mind quickly are don't 
sleep through the night anymore. There isn't a day that goes by that ' s I 
don't think about the loss of Ron or the loss of all the things that we 
would have had in the future. I don't concentrate as well. I forget a lot 
more than I used to. Changed in relationship to my daughter. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: 
 
Q. How is that? 
 
A. Because her life is much more painful and difficult for her.  
 
Q. Are you closer with her?  
 
A. It's hard to imagine closer, but I guess the answer would be yes. 
 
Q. How about the relationship with your wife? 
 
A. Same. Our whole life is upside down. They are - Life is more 
stressful. Our lives are an open book, almost no privacy. 
 
Q. Would you agree to some extent that you have sought out publicity?  
 
A. Haven't sought the publicity, no. 
 
Q. But you have spoken to the press when asked to? 
 
A. On occasion, yes. 
 
Q. And you elected to go to the trial and be there everyday, correct?  
 
A. I was not there everyday. I was there as often as I could be as work 
permitted.  
 
Q. How often was that?  
 
A. I don't know that it was consistent, but I was there numerous times 
during the week: sometimes morning, sometimes afternoons, 
occasionally all day. It's whenever I could break free. It was an 
uncomfortable, ongoing; balancing act between work and trial. 
 
Q. And your work is - What do you do? 
 
A. I sell point-of-purchase displays.  
 
Q. Do you design them or manufacture them, or are you in sales? 
 
A. Sales. My company manufactures. 
 
Q. What's the name of the company? 
 
A. Reliable Container. 
 
Q. And it's not a 9:00 to 5:00 job; it's a job you can do sort of 
independent of a clock?  
 
A. No. It's pretty much still a 9:00 to 5:00 job. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: I don't have any further questions. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Same stipulation. Mr. Brewer? 
 
MR. BREWER: No questions. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Same stipulation with Kim Goldman. It was 20 
days. 
 
MR. VAN SICKLEN: Okay. 
 
(By instruction of counsel the reporter has redacted the following 
stipulation from the deposition of Kimberly E. Goldman as reproduced 
below:  
 
MR. P. BAKER: Propose the stipulation that the deposition be sent to 
Mr. Petrocelli's office. It's about 143 pages, so 15 days, 20 days to 
review the deposition transcript. Make any changes then sign. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: 20 is fine. 
 
MR. P. BAKER: 20 days. And Mr. Petrocelli will advise me if there 
are any changes made to that deposition testimony. And also propose 
that we stipulate that if the original is lost, a copy can be used in its 
stead. 
 
MR. BREWER: So stipulated. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: So stipulated.) 
 
(The proceedings concluded at 10:33 a m.) 
 
I declare under penalty of perjury under the State of California that the 
foregoing is true and correct.

EXAMINATION BY MR. KELLY:  
 
Q: Good morning, Mr. Cowlings.  
 
A: Good morning. 
 
Q: My name is John Kelly, and I represent Nicole's estate.  If I ask 
you any questions you do not understand or you want me to 
rephrase, just let me know and we will take care of that. 
 
Secondly, if there is any time you want to take a break or you want 
to talk to your attorney, Mr. Re, let me know and we will 
accommodate you with that also. 
 
You have to speak up a little bit.   
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you understand that you are under oath here today?    
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Have you ever given sworn testimony in a deposition 
before? 
   
A: Yes, I have. 
 
Q: And when was that? 
 
A: I guess maybe about a year, year and a half ago.  No, it was 
probably a year ago. 
 
Q: Okay.  And what type of case was that? 
 
A: It was a lawsuit. 
 
Q: What type of lawsuit? 
 
A: Guy was trying to sue me for not selling him my car. 
 
Q: Okay.  So this was someone who was suing you? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: For money? 
 
A: Uh-huh.  Well, the car, actually, he was trying to sue me for. 
 
Q: Okay.  And you gave a sworn deposition during that? 
 
A: Yes, I did, uh-huh.  
 
Q: Okay.  And what was the name of the person who was suing 
you? 
 
A: I have no idea. He was out of Minnesota.  It was pertaining to 
my truck.  Basically that was it.  It was all a surprise to me when it 
happened, and it ended up in my favor, so... 
 
Q: Okay.  And you told the truth during your deposition? 
 
A: Yes, I did. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did that matter ever go to trial? 
 
A: Yeah, it went to trial.   
 
Q: Went to trial also? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Did you testify at trial?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And you told the truth during your deposition? 
 
A: Yes, I did. 
 
Q: You told the truth during the trial? 
 
A: Yes, I did. 
 
Q: Okay.  When was the last time you spoke to Mr. Simpson?  
Prior to coming here today, when was the last time you spoke to 
him? 
 
A: I spoke with him Sunday. 
 
Q: Okay.  And did you discuss any of the deposition testimony he 
had given when he had been here for that 10-day period? 
 
A: No, huh-uh. 
 
Q: Have you ever discussed any of the testimony he gave here 
during this deposition? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Could you tell me how many times you've seen Mr. Simpson 
since he gave his deposition here? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Mr. Cowlings, when one of these gentlemen object, we will let 
them state their objection, but you will still have to answer the 
question. 
 
A: I don't know.  Maybe a handful of times. 
 
Q: More than six? 
 
A: Maybe a handful of times.  I don't have a definite number. 
 
Q: Okay.  Approximately five, six times? 
 
A: Something like that. 
 
Q: And you never discussed his testimony --  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- here?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever discuss anything relating to the murders of Nicole 
Brown Simpson or Ron Goldman when you saw him that handful 
of times? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Nothing? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever discuss Nicole Brown Simpson with him at all? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Could you tell me when you discussed that? 
 
A: Well, things come up when I'm at the house, and the house 
reminds me a lot of Nicole, and it bothers me. 
 
Q: That she's dead? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Could you tell me when you were last there at the 
house? 
 
MR. BREWER: At the house, are we talking about -- 
 
MR. KELLY: Rockingham. I'm sorry.  
 
THE WITNESS: It would have been almost three weeks, I would 
say. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: And did you discuss Nicole at that time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Prior to your being at Rockingham three weeks ago, when had 
you been at Rockingham before that? 
 
A: Probably -- I don't know.  I mean, I've been by there.  I can't 
give you a definite -- from that three weeks ago, when was, you 
know, the time before then, I couldn't tell you. 
 
Q: Well, was it after Christmas? 
 
A: Oh, yeah. 
 
Q: Okay.  And could you give me the month you were there where 
you had a discussion regarding Nicole with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: You know, when I'm there at times.  You know, I'm not there 
that long.  Just like I just said, probably the last time it's been in 
those five times, I don't know how many times I've said something 
about Nicole. 
 
Q: Okay.  When you say you've "said something," could you tell 
me what you've said?  Just in general terms. 
 
A: Just the fact that the house has -- that Nicole was very 
instrumental in doing a lot of things around the house, designing it, 
the layout about it, the pool, and to sit there and -- you know, it's a 
difficult thing. 
 
Q: Okay.  You spent a lot of time there when she was working on 
the house? 
 
A: Yeah.  Matter of fact, I oversaw the house when they were back 
in New York, when it was under construction. 
 
Q: This is when Mr. Simpson first bought the house? 
 
A: No.  They had the house redone. 
 
Q: Okay. This was after Nicole and Mr. Simpson had gotten 
married? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. This was -- they redid the grounds with the pool? 
 
A: Pool, inside. 
 
Q: Kitchen? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was that basically Nicole's doing or overseeing all that 
work? 
 
A: Most likely, her and O.J. both.  I'd say it was a mutual thing. 
 
Q: Okay.  Prior to coming here today, did you meet with your 
attorney, Mr. Re, at all? 
 
A: Yeah. I have lunch with him all the time. 
 
Q: Okay. And any of those times you've had lunch with him or met 
with him, has anybody been there with you other than Mr. Re or 
any member of his staff? 
 
A: Another lawyer, or sometimes we have lunch with Mona Soo? 
 
MR. RE: Sue. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, Mona Soo. 
 
MR. KELLY: Someone from your office? 
 
THE WITNESS: Uh-huh. 
 
MR.RE: Someone who's associated with my office, yeah. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  Other than that attorney, anybody else who has ever 
joined you for lunch or when you've discussed your upcoming 
deposition? 
 
A: No, no, uh-uh. 
 
Q: Okay. You know Cora Fischman, don't you? 
 
A: Yes, I do. 
 
Q: Okay.  Have you spoken to her in the last couple of months? 
 
A: I've saw her at O.J.'s. 
 
Q: And when did you see her at Mr. Simpson's house? 
 
A: It was one of the weekends that O.J. had the kids up from 
Laguna, and Cora brought her kids over. 
 
Q: How long ago was that?  
 
A: Could have been three, four weeks ago. 
 
Q: Do you know whether that was before or after she had given her 
deposition --  
 
A: I have no knowledge.    
 
Q: -- testimony?    
 
A: I don't know.    
 
Q: Okay.  Mr. Cowlings, just let me finish the question, and then 
you can give your answer.  Okay?  Did you discuss Nicole Brown 
Simpson with Cora at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you discuss any of the facts or circumstances 
surrounding Nicole's or Ron's murder with her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Could you tell me when was the last time you saw 
Christian Reichardt? 
 
A: Christian Reichardt was at O.J.'s house one day when I came 
by.  That's been a while. 
 
Q: Could you approximate how long ago that was? 
 
A: Could have been a month, month and a half, two months.  I 
really don't know. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you know if the kids were up there then? 
 
A: I don't know.  It's been a while. 
 
Q: Okay.  Would it be more than two months ago? 
 
A: It was a long time. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall any conversation you've had with him at 
that time?    
 
A: "Hi, how are you doing?" "How are you doing," and that's about 
the extent of it. 
 
Q: Did you talk about Nicole at all with him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you talk about Faye Resnick with him at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you talk about Core Fischman with him at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you talk about Mr. Simpson with him at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You knew Michelle, Mr. Simpson's housekeeper -- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- for many years, did you not?  
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Can you tell me when was the last time you spoke to her? 
 
A: I couldn't tell you.  I don't remember. 
 
Q: Has it been since Christmastime that you saw her? 
 
A: It's been a long time.  She was by the house one day helping 
out. 
 
Q: At Rockingham? 
 
A: Right, uh-huh. 
 
Q: What was she helping out with? 
 
A: Doing cleaning up, you know, straightening up the kitchen, 
what have you. 
 
Q: Do you know if that was before or after Christmas in this past 
year? 
 
A: I have no knowledge, no. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you have any discussions of Nicole with her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Any discussions regarding Mr. Simpson with her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Any discussions regarding the facts and circumstances 
regarding Nicole's murder with her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you ever have any such discussion with Michelle? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever have any such discussion with Christian 
Reichardt? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Ever, not from June 12th, 1994 on? 
 
A: June what? 
 
Q: 12th, 1994, the day of Nicole's murder. 
 
A: We spoke one time on the phone.  
 
Q: And when was that? 
 
A: It must have been maybe two weeks after the 17th, I would say. 
 
Q: After June 17th, 1994? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Did he call you or did you call him? 
 
A: I called him. 
 
Q: And what was the purpose of your call? 
 
A: My purpose of the call was to try to find out what Faye knew 
about this, and the conversation went for a few minutes, and that 
was it. 
 
Q: Could you tell me what you said to Mr. Reichardt? 
 
A: Exactly the words I used, but I was trying to find out who were 
some of the people that they were frequenting with, who -- 
basically just trying to find out some answers. 
 
Q: Well, could you tell me the questions you asked him? 
 
A: I just wanted to know who Nicole was hanging out with. 
 
Q: In that time period at the end in June of 1994? 
 
A: It would have been, like I said, a couple weeks after the 17th. 
 
Q: No.  But I'm saying, what time period were you asking him 
about who Nicole and Faye were hanging out with? 
 
A: I knew they were going out together a lot.  I just wanted to find 
out. 
 
Q: Okay.  And what did Mr. Reichardt tell you? 
 
A: He said that Faye was under doctor's care, and her lawyer 
suggested for her not to speak to anyone. 
 
Q: I know, but you had a conversation with Mr. Reichardt himself, 
did you not? 
 
A: That's who I spoke to. 
 
Q: Okay.  And what did he tell you other than the fact Faye could 
not speak to you? 
 
A: That was it. 
 
Q: He didn't give you any information as to who -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  You have got to let me finish the question, Mr. 
Cowlings. Okay?  He did not give you any information or any 
names as to who Faye and Nicole were hanging out with? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: No, he didn't. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  Did he tell you anything other than Faye was under a 
doctor's care and couldn't speak to anybody? 
 
A: That was all he told me. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did he tell you anything about Faye's drug use? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he tell you anything about Faye owing anybody money? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he tell you anything about drug lords stalking Faye 
Resnick? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Could you tell me, did you talk to Cora Fischman any 
time after June 12th, 1994? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How many times? 
 
A: Once. 
 
Q: And when was that? 
 
A The exact day and time, I couldn't tell you.  It -- we met, we took 
a walk, and we talked about the situation that had occurred. 
 
Q: Meaning the murders?  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Where did you meet Cora? 
 
A: We were on San Vicente in Santa Monica between 26th and 
Burlingame. 
 
Q: Was that a meeting that had been arranged? 
 
A: Yeah, we had talked, and that's where we suggested to meet. 
 
Q: Sat right on the street there? 
 
A: Yeah, right on the -- there is a grass divider that runs about four 
miles from Barrington down to Ocean Avenue on Sancente. 
 
Q: And who had initiated that phone call to set up the meeting. 
 
A: I did. 
 
Q: Okay.  And could you tell me what you said when you called 
Cora? 
 
A: I wanted to talk to her and she wanted to talk to me. 
 
Q: And that was the extent of the conversation? 
 
A: On the phone, yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And could you tell me how long you were with Cora for 
when you met with her? 
 
A: 20 minutes, I guess, 25 minutes. 
 
Q: And could you tell me what you said to her? 
 
A: It was reports stating that she said if O.J. didn't do it, she knew 
who did. 
 
Q: I am sorry.  Could you repeat that? 
 
A: It was reports or she had made a comment that if O.J. didn't 
commit the murders, she know who did, and I wanted to know who 
that person was. 
 
Q: Cora Fischman had said this? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And where did you find out or from whom did you find out 
Cora Fischman had said this? 
 
A: I was getting a lot of phone calls from various people. 
 
Q: Could you give me the names of some of the people who 
called? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Could you tell me exactly what you had been told that Cora 
knew? 
 
A: That Cora said that if O.J. didn't commit the murders, she know 
who did. 
 
Q: Well, did you understand from that that she still thought O.J. 
may have the committed the murders? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Speculation. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: You can answer the question. 
 
A: I have no idea.  I didn't read into it.  All I wanted to know was 
who did she think had committed the murders. 
 
Q: Okay.  And when you met with her, what did you say to her? 
 
A: She asked me, "Did O.J. do it?"  And I said, "No," and I asked 
her, "It was a rumor going around that you said if O.J. didn't do it, 
you know who committed the murders." 
 
Q: And what did she say? 
 
A: She told me the person. 
 
Q: Who had killed Nicole and Ron? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And what name did she give you? 
 
A: Michelle, the maid. 
 
Q: Okay.  And when you had told her that you knew that O.J. 
didn't do that, was that something Mr. Simpson had told you? 
 
A: No.  Just my gut feeling. 
 
Q: Okay.  How did -- Strike that.  When you spoke to Cora and she 
told you Michelle had committed the murders, could you tell me 
how she elaborated on this at all? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I have no knowledge.  When she just mentioned 
it to me, I kind of like laughed. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Well, there's about 20 minutes left there after she had 
mentioned this to you. 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Could you tell me what you spoke about then? 
 
A: We just spoke about the relationship between her and Nicole, 
my relationship with Nicole, the life and the love between O.J. and 
Nicole and how did it end up in a situation like this. 
 
Q: What did Cora tell you about her relationship with Nicole? 
 
A: They were very close. 
 
Q: Did she say anything more than they were very close? 
 
A: They were very close.  They were best of friends. 
 
Q: Did she tell you anything Nicole had said to her about Mr. 
Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Could you tell me what you told her about your 
relationship with Nicole? 
 
A: That I miss her.  She was very close and very dear to me. 
 
Q: Have you spoke to Gigi at all since the murders?  Or do you 
know who Gigi is, first of all? 
 
A: O.J.'s maid? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: I see her when I go by, I speak to her, when I go by O.J.'s 
house. 
 
Q: Okay. Have you ever spoken to her regarding the facts and 
circumstances regarding Nicole and Ron's murder? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Have you ever spoken to her about Nicole at all? 
 
A: I don't remember if I did or not.  Gigi is, you know, just the lady 
that takes care of the house. 
 
Q: Did Cora ever tell you why she thought Michelle was the 
murderer? 
 
A: I guess it had to stem from the relationship between Michelle 
and Nicole. 
 
Q: Did Cora tell you anything about the relationship between 
Michelle and Nicole? 
 
A: I guess they were at difficulty, some kind of difficulty.  To the 
exact -- to what extent, I don't know. 
 
Q: That Michelle and Nicole had had some difficulty? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you have no personal knowledge of any of those 
difficulties? 
 
A: No. 
 
A: Did Cora tell you any of the facts regarding the difficulties -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- Michelle and Nicole had? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did Cora give you any other facts regarding Michelle 
being the murderer? 
 
A: No.  I --when she had mentioned it to me, I just shook my head 
and, like I said, I smiled and just, you know, didn't even elaborate 
on it. 
 
Q: Okay.  Now, other than calling Cora and Christian Reichardt, 
could you tell me who else you called looking for information on 
the murders? 
 
A: I called Cici. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was this in the same time period? 
 
A: Yeah, about the same week. 
 
Q: And this would be approximately two weeks after June 17? 
 
A: I can't give you a definite date.  I know it had to be after 
because that's when -- I would assume that it all happened for me to 
try to get in touch with some of Nicole's friends. 
 
Q: Okay. By the way, when you called Christian Reichardt, did 
you happen to tape-record that conversation? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you met with Cora Fischman, did you happen --  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You are going to have to let me finish the question, Mr. 
Cowlings.  Okay?  When you met with Cora Fischman, did you 
tape-record that conversation? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Had you spoken to any members of Mr. Simpson's defense team 
regarding contacting people? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object as leading. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: You can answer the question. 
 
A: Bob Shapiro. 
 
Q: And could you tell me -- What day did you meet with him? 
 
A: We spoke on the phone. 
 
Q: Could you tell me approximately when? 
 
A: Had to be after -- sometime in June or July.  I couldn't give you 
a definite date. 
 
Q: Well, was it a result of this conversation you had with Mr. 
Shapiro that you started making these phone calls?  
 
A: No, uh-uh.  Bob had called me. 
 
Q: Okay. What was the purpose of his call? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Speculation. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Can you tell me the purpose of the call from Mr. Shapiro? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Same objection. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: I am sorry.  Could you answer? 
 
A: He wanted to speak to Nicole's friends. 
 
Q: Okay. And did he tell you which friends he wanted to speak to? 
 
A: To the ones I had spoken with. 
 
Q: Well, would it be fair to say, Mr. Cowlings, that you had called 
these friends of Nicole's at Mr. Shapiro's request? 
   
A: No. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: I am sorry.  Your answer? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Had you spoken to these people prior to Mr. Shapiro 
calling you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you tell Mr. Shapiro you had spoken to these 
people? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you tell him the substance of these conversations? 
 
A: Just trying to find some answers.  
 
Q: You told him you were trying to find some answers? 
 
A: Uh-huh, yes. 
 
Q: Did he call you because he knew you had spoken to some of 
Nicole's friends? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Speculation. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Did he indicate that to you in the conversation, that he 
knew you had spoken to some of Nicole's friends? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading.   
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
MR. KELLY: Mr. Leonard, just let me finish the question before 
you --  
 
MR. LEONARD: I thought you had. 
 
MR. KELLY: -- voice your objection.  Okay. I grew up in the 
Midwest. I have a very slow pattern there. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  Could you tell me, had anybody told Mr. Shapiro that 
you had spoken to friends of Nicole's? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I have no knowledge of that. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  And he never indicated that to you in a phone call, that 
he knew you had spoken to these people? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Could you please tell me what you said to Cici when you called 
her? 
 
A: I went by -- well, I had called her and then wanted to speak with 
her, and she said "No problem," and I went by her apartment. 
 
Q: And did you say anything other than that when you called her? 
 
A: That's about the extent of it.  We spoke, and I told her I wanted 
to speak to her. 
 
Q: Okay.  And how long were you at her apartment for? 
 
A: 20 minutes, 25 minutes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Could you tell me what you said to her? 
 
A: I was just trying to find out the people -- that they were hanging 
out with or what have you. 
 
Q: When you say who "they were hanging out with," who are you 
referring to? 
 
A: Friends of theirs. 
 
Q: Meaning Cici and Nicole? 
 
A: Cici, Nicole, Faye. 
 
Q: Okay. Other than Mr. Reichardt, Cora and Cici, were there any 
other friends of Nicole's? 
 
A: I spoke with [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: Okay. Going back to Cici for a minute, who did Cici tell you 
that she and Nicole had been hanging out with? 
 
A: She didn't say. 
 
Q: Why is that? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. She just didn't say. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did she indicate that she didn't want to tell you? 
 
A: Really, I don't know. She just -- she just didn't say. 
 
Q: Okay.  When you spoke to Cici, did you discuss Nicole's 
murder at all? 
 
A: Probably talked about it. 
 
Q: All right. Did Cici indicate to you who she thought had 
murdered Nicole and Ron? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you tell her who you thought had murdered Nicole 
and Ron? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Could you tell me any of the substance of the 
conversation when you were with Cici, at all? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: Basically, you know, a lot of it was still 
confusing.  It was hard to come to grips with the situation.  It was a 
very, you know, difficult thing to talk about and, like I said, it   
only lasted maybe 20, 25 minutes. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Can you tell me anything more specifically as to what Cici said 
to you? 
 
A: No, I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay. She didn't tell you anybody she and Nicole had been 
hanging out with that last year or two? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: You asked her, though? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. Did she tell you anything about Nicole when you were 
there for that 20 or 25 minutes? 
 
A: When you say "about," about what? 
 
Q: Anything.  I am trying to find out what you talked to her for 20 
or 25 minutes. 
 
A: The fact that, you know, our friend is dead. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you call [Name Deleted] in the same time period 
also? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  By the way, when you spoke to -- who did you speak to 
first out of these people?  Was it Cora? Christian? Cici? [Name 
Deleted]? 
 
A: It could have been Cici. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you tell her you were going to be speaking -- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --to other people also?  
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Okay. Did she respond to that in any way? 
 
A: Seemed like she had no problem with it. 
 
Q: Okay.  When you spoke to Cora, did Cora know that you had 
already spoken to Cici? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I really don't know.  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. When you spoke to Mr. Reichardt, did he know that you 
had spoken to Cora and Cici already? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Same objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: I have no knowledge of it. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Could you tell me, did you call [Name Deleted] during 
this same time period? 
   
A: Yes, we spoke. 
 
Q: Okay.  And what did you say to her when you called her? 
 
A: I wanted to meet with her. 
 
Q: And what was her response to that? 
 
A: "No problem." 
 
Q: Okay.  And then did you meet with her? 
 
A: Yes, I did. 
 
Q: And how long after you called her did you met with her? 
 
A: I think we met the same day that I called. 
 
Q: And where did you meet? 
 
A: Right off of San Vicente street.  Right off of San Vicente 
between 26th Street and Burlingame.  The exact street, I don't 
know.  We just -- 
 
Q: Was this in the same vicinity -- 
 
A: Cora, yes. 
 
Q: -- that you had met Cora with? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Okay.  And you had already met with Cora? 
 
A: I think so. 
 
Q: Was there any particular reason you chose this location to meet 
Cora and [Name Deleted] there? 
 
A: It was convenient for both -- for the two of us.  
 
Q: Okay.  And could you tell me what you spoke to [Name 
Deleted] about when you met with her? 
 
A: I wanted to know who were some of the t  people that they were 
hanging out with. 
 
Q: And what did [Name Deleted] tell you? 
 
A: She didn't. 
 
Q: How long were you with -- 
 
A: She said that she didn't -- wasn't out with Nicole that much 
because she had her own problems and she wasn't going out as 
much. 
 
Q: Okay.  And other than that, did she say anything else to you? 
 
A: No, because she didn't know. 
 
Q: Now, Mr. Cowlings, when you met with [Name Deleted], did 
you tape record that conversation? 
 
A: No, I didn't. 
 
Q: Was anybody else aware of the fact or had you told anybody 
else you were going to a meeting with [Name Deleted] at that time 
and that place? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the compound nature of the question.  
Would you break it up, please? 
 
MR. KELLY: Yes, Mr. Leonard. 
 
Q: When you met with [Name Deleted], had you told anybody else 
that you would be meeting with her at that time and that place? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Do you -- had you spoken to any investigators for Mr. Simpson 
before meeting with [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: I spoke to an investigator. 
 
Q: And what was his name? 
 
A: I don't know.  He was no longer -- he didn't stay that long.  He 
was an assistant to one of the head investigators. 
 
Q: Was an assistant to Pavelick? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was there anybody to your knowledge videotaping your 
meeting with Cora Fischman at that location when you met with 
her? 
 
A: I had no knowledge of it. 
 
Q: Had you told anybody prior to going there that you would be 
meeting with her at that location? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you went to that same location and met with [Name 
Deleted], do you have any knowledge of anybody videotaping your 
meeting with [Name Deleted] at that location? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Had you told anybody that you were going to be meeting with 
her there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Now, other than these four people -- Reichardt, Cora 
Fischman, Cici and [Name Deleted] -- was there anybody else you 
reached out to speak to? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  And was this something that you had taken upon 
yourself, Mr. Cowlings, to call these four people? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Had you discussed calling them with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Had Mr. Simpson asked you to call these people? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did any attorney for Mr. Simpson ask you to call these people? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Had any investigator asked you to call these people? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you later discuss with Mr. Simpson the 
conversations that you had with any of these people? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did you ever discuss with any attorney for Mr. Simpson the 
conversations you had had with any of these four people? 
 
A: Bob Shapiro. 
 
Q: Okay.  And was that the time he gave you the phone call? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And once again, did he indicate the purpose of his phone 
call to you? 
 
A: He wanted to speak to them. 
 
Q: To these same four people? 
 
A: Right 
 
Q: Okay. But he did not know that you had spoken to them 
already? 
 
A: I think after we had talked for a few minutes, he knew that I had 
spoken with them. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you arrange for Mr. Shapiro to meet with Christian 
Reichardt? 
 
A: No. What Bob did was put him on a conference call, three-way 
-- three-way call from his phone and my phone.  And I don't think 
we reached anybody, but if their machines answered, he left his 
name and number and said he would like to speak with them. 
 
Q: And you never reached any of these four people directly that 
day? 
 
A: I don't think so. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you know whether Cici ever called Mr. Shapiro after 
that? 
 
A: I have no knowledge. 
 
Q: Do you know whether Cora Fischman ever called Mr. Shapiro 
back? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation, lack of 
foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I have no knowledge. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Do you know whether [Name Deleted] ever called Mr. Shapiro 
back?  
 
MR. LEONARD: Same objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: I have no knowledge of it. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. And prior to coming in here today, do you know who 
Robert Baker is, Mr. Simpson's civil attorney? 
 
A: I know of him. 
 
Q: Okay.  Have you ever met with him prior to today? 
 
A: No, I haven't. 
 
Q: Do you know who Phillip Baker is?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever -- okay.  So you've obviously never met with 
him. 
 
A: No, I haven't. 
 
Q: Okay. Have you ever met with Mr. Leonard prior to today? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Have you ever discussed any of the testimony you are 
going to be giving at your deposition, with him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  When was the last time you met with Mr. Leonard? 
 
A: It's been a while. 
 
Q: Okay. Was that after the criminal trial was completed? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was it after Christmas of this past year? 
 
A: I don't know the exact date.  It was a day I went by, and he was 
there with O.J. 
 
Q: At Rockingham? 
 
A: Uh-huh.  Yes. Yes.    
 
Q: Okay. Could you tell me what you discussed with him? 
 
A: I guess that sooner or later I was going to be called for a 
deposition. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you discuss any of the facts or circumstances 
surrounding Nicole's murder--  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- with him?  Did you discuss any conversations you had had 
with Mr. Simpson, with Mr. Leonard? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Could you tell me what you do remember discussing with Mr. 
Leonard when you spoke to him at Rockingham? 
 
A: That how the house -- I was bothered by being at the house. 
 
Q: Because of Nicole's presence there? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Other than that, could you tell me anything else you discussed 
with him? 
 
A: I think he went and got something to eat. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever see him make any notes?  
 
A: Pardon?    
 
Q: Did he take any notes when you were talking to him? 
 
A: I have no knowledge of that. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall him asking you any questions that you 
might be asked at a deposition? 
 
A: Excuse me? You say what? 
 
Q: Do you recall Mr. Leonard asking you any questions that you 
might later be asked at a deposition? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  What about Mr. Blasier, have you ever spoken to him in 
the last couple of months? 
 
A: Saying hi. 
 
Q: Have you ever discussed or done any sort of preparation for this 
deposition with Mr. Blasier? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  What about with Peter Neufeld? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  What's the question? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Have you ever met with Peter Neufeld since the completion of 
the criminal trial? 
 
A: I met him. 
 
Q: Have you ever met with him in preparation of this deposition? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What about with F. Lee Bailey?    
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever met with -- Have I missed anybody, Mr. 
Leonard? 
 
MR. LEONARD: I don't think so. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Melissa Fink --  
 
A: Who's that? 
 
Q: Have you ever heard of her?    
 
A: I have no knowledge of her.  
 
Q: And I've got to ask, what about Alan Dershowitz? Have you 
ever met with him --  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- to discuss this case at all?    
 
A: No. 
 
MR. BREWER: Johnnie Cochran. 
 
MR. KELLY: That's a good question. 
 
Q: With the criminal case, did you ever -- after June 17th, 1994, did 
you ever meet with Johnnie Cochran? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: After June 17th,1994, did you ever meet with Robert Shapiro? 
 
MR. RE: Well I am going -- if you are including a period of time 
between June 17th for a period of approximately two weeks, we 
are going to be asserting the privilege with regard to anything that 
went on during that period of time. 
 
MR. KELLY: Was Mr. Shapiro acting as his attorney during that 
period of time? 
 
MR.RE: I am asserting the Fifth Amendment privilege. 
 
MR. KELLY: Oh, Fifth Amendment privilege.  This is during the 
same period of time he just answered all the questions regarding 
the other individuals he met with and spoke to? 
 
MR. RE: No.  He said that was two weeks or a week after that 
period of time.  I am talking about the period of time from the date 
of the killing for a period of approximately two weeks after that. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
Q: Prior to your meetings with Cici and Cora and [Name Deleted] 
and speaking to Reichardt, had you spoken to Mr. Shapiro at all 
during that time period? 
 
MR. RE: Wait a second. During what time period are you talking 
about? 
 
MR. KELLY: Prior to his meeting with these individuals and after 
June 17th. 
 
MR.RE: Well, that's the period of time that we are asserting the 
privilege to. 
   
MR. KELLY: Okay.  So you don't want him answering anything -- 
 
MR. RE: Right. 
 
MR. KELLY: -- in that time frame. 
 
MR. RE: That's right. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
Q: Did you meet with Carl Douglas at all -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- after this two-week period after the 17th? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  What about Barry Scheck? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you meet with any other attorneys on Mr. Simpson's 
criminal defense team? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: No attorneys from Mr. Cochran's office? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you meet with -- I know you had mentioned the 
name Bill Pavelick.  Did you meet with any investigators from Mr. 
Simpson's criminal defense team after, say, late June 1994?   
 
A: Just, like I say, that one guy.  He didn't last too long.  I met him 
at a hotel. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall what you discussed with him? 
 
A: He asked me about certain people and what did I know about 
them. 
 
Q: What hotel did you meet this individual at? 
 
A: At the Marriott in Century City. 
 
Q: There is only one Marriott there?    
 
A: As far as I know. 
 
Q: Okay.  I don't know.  I am asking you.  As far as you know, 
there is just one? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay.  And what street is that on?  
 
A: Avenue of the Stars. 
 
Q: Okay.  And you don't remember this individual's name? 
 
A: No, I don't. 
 
Q: Okay.  How long did you meet with him for? 
 
A: It was a while. I guess an hour or so. 
 
Q: Okay.  And how was this meeting arranged? 
 
A: He called me. 
   
Q: And what did he say to you? 
 
A: That he was working for Bill Pavelick and that he wanted to 
meet with me. 
 
Q: What, if anything, did you do to confirm that this gentleman 
was in fact working for Mr. Simpson? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
   
MR. RE: Give me a moment. 
 
(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the 
hearing of the reporter.) 
 
MR. RE: Okay. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, let me see --  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Want to take a minute? 
 
A: No.  Yeah, it was after. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay? 
 
MR. RE: Yeah. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. Could I have the last question read back, 
please. 
 
(Pending question read as follows: 
 
"Q: What, if anything, did you do to confirm that this gentleman 
was in fact working for Mr. Simpson?) 
 
MR. LEONARD: Same objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: To be honest with you, I don't know. 
   
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did you do anything, or take him on his word that he was 
working for Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: I just assumed that he was working for him.  He called me.  I 
think I was told -- I think I was told by Bob Kardashian about him. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Move to strike the last answer. 
 
MR. KELLY: Why is that? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Speculation. 
 
(Discussion held between the Witness and counsel outside the 
hearing of the reporter.) 
 
MR. KELLY: You didn't strike that, did you? 
 
Q: Had you been told by Mr. Kardashian prior to this phone call 
that you would be contained by someone? 
 
A: All I know, he called and he stated he was working for Bill 
Pavelick and that he wanted to talk with me, and so I went over to 
the hotel. 
 
Q: Did you go over there the same day? 
 
A: I don't -- I don't remember if it was the same day or the next day 
or... 
 
Q: Okay. Was anybody there at the hotel other than you and this 
gentleman? 
 
A: Just him and I. 
 
Q: Okay.  How long were you there for? 
 
A: About an hour or so, I guess. 
 
Q: Could you tell me what was discussed between the two of you 
during this hour? 
 
A: Hopefully, to -- he asked me about a number of people.  He used 
to train at a gym that I used to train at years ago. He had a cold. 
 
Q: He had a cold? 
 
A: Yeah, we talked about his cold. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: And... 
 
Q: Well, when you say he asked you about a "number of people," 
whom did he ask you about? 
 
A: About some of Nicole's friends. 
 
Q: Could you be specific for me which friends of Nicole's did he 
ask you about? 
 
A: Cora Fischman. 
 
Q: And what did you tell him about Cora Fischman? 
 
A: That her and Nicole was real good friends, jogging friends.  
They used to run together, I should say. 
 
Q: Okay.  Anything other than this? 
 
A: It was probably Nicole's best friend. 
 
Q: You told him that Cora was probably Nicole's best friend? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: And had Nicole told you that?    
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Had Cora told you that? 
 
A: No.  I knew that for a fact.  They spent a lot of time together. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you tell this gentleman that Cora thought Michelle 
had murdered Nicole and Ron Goldman? 
 
A: No, uh-uh. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you ever tell anybody that? 
 
MR. RE: You. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah. 
 
MR. KELLY: I feel special.   
 
THE WITNESS: No, no. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Who else did this gentleman ask you about? 
 
A: Faye. 
 
Q: And what did you tell him about Faye? 
 
A: I didn't know Faye that well. 
 
Q: Is that all you told him? 
 
A: I didn't know anything about Faye.  I mean, I had seen her a few 
times, her and Nicole, but I didn't know anything about her 
background. 
 
Q: Okay.  And there was nobody in this hotel room except you and 
this investigator? 
 
A: As far as I know.  Just him and I sitting there. 
 
Q: Do you remember what floor the room was on? 
 
A: I took an elevator.  We went up. 
 
Q: Was it a suite?  Do you recall? 
 
A: It was a room, a hotel room. 
 
Q: Okay. After he asked you about Cora and Faye, who else did he 
ask you about? 
 
A: He asked me about Ron Shipp. 
 
Q: Okay. And what did you tell him about Ron Shipp? 
 
A: That Ron had been around for a number of years doing things, 
you know, for O.J. and Nicole. 
 
Q: By the way, was Ron Shipp a very close friend of Nicole's?

Q: Were you ever asked to?

MR. RE: Right. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay.

order. 
 
A: Which tape was that? 
 
Q: Do you know of more than one? 
 
A: O.J.'s been selling a lot of stuff over the years. 
   
Q: I'm talking about the one after his acquittal on the criminal 
charges regarding the murders of Ron and Nicole. 
 
A: Oh, talking about the tape now.  I thought you were talking 
about his exercise tapes.  There's a lot of tapes O.J. has done.  Sold 
vitamins, too. 
 
Q: We'll stay away from the exercise tapes. 
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q: Have you seen that videotape?

MR. LEONARD: Yeah. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
Q: So as far as you're concerned, everything that you heard Mr. 
Simpson say in that videotape was accurate? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: When you say "accurate," I mean, I listened to it. 
 
MR. RE: Let me just make something clear here:  I haven't seen 
the whole videotape.  If there is a portion of that videotape that 
deals with the time frame we are talking about, then as to that part I 
am asking him to assert the privilege.  As to the remainder, he is 
free to answer. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
Q: Is there anything in that videotape that you heard Mr. Simpson 
say that you know was not true? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: I just listened to it.  I wanted to listen to it. 
   
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know of anything Mr. Simpson said in that 
videotape that wasn't true in your opinion? 
 
A: I have no knowledge. I mean, I was just listening to it.  What he 
covered was basically with the trial, I mean, and I didn't watch the 
trial that much. 
 
Q: One more time: Is there anything in that videotape that Mr. 
Simpson said that you know to be not true?  
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. That's an unfair question.  Why don't 
you --  
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. 
 
MR. LEONARD: If you have a transcript, if you want to show him 
something. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, if you tell me something, you know, 
specific. I don't know.  He covered a lot of stuff. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: I know.  I am asking: Do you know of anything he covered that 
was untrue? 
 
A: I have no knowledge of it. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Same objection.  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  You have no knowledge of anything being untrue that he 
spoke of in his videotape.

THEWITNESS: I have no -- I listened to the tape, and I wasn't 
there to -- I just listened to it. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  Did anything strike you as untrue that Mr. Simpson said 
during the course of that videotape? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Same objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: Not to my knowledge. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Show him the transcript or play the videotape so 
he can answer the question fairly.

Q: Teaser.  
 
A: Teaser.  
 
Q: That's the East, the teaser.  
 
A: But to what he said, no. 
 
Q: Okay.  In the trailer/tickler/teaser that you saw, was there 
anything in there that you heard him say that was inaccurate or 
untrue? 
 
A: No. He just said that this is going to be shown on BET.

MR. RE: Right. 
 
MR. KELLY: What I was just asking him is, does he recall giving

A: [address deleted]. 
 
Q: Is that here in the LA. area? 
 
A: Pacific Palisades. 
 
Q: And -- I was going to get to it -- would you mind, or I will ask 
your attorney, if you could just write down his full address --  
 
A: No 
 
Q: -- and make it available.    
 
A: Uh-uh. 
 
MR. RE: We will talk to you about that possibly off the record. 
 
THE WITNESS: No, uh-uh. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let me say, then, can we have your 
agreement right now that you will accept service of a trial 
subpoena on this witness? 
 
MR. RE: Sure. 
   
THE WITNESS: Yeah. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
MR. RE: Sure. Certainly. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: And the trial is for September 9.  Okay?  So 
we will serve a subpoena on you.  And you are authorized to accept 
it on behalf of --  
 
MR. RE: You can serve it right now on him. 
 
THE WITNESS: You don't have to go on TV again and say that 
you couldn't find me, that I was trying to hide out. 
 
MR. KELLY: You are not going to stay here till the 9th, are you? 
 
MR. RE: He has always been available through me. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I wish all the other witnesses -- 
 
MR. RE: He will always be available through me. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: -- would be so cooperative; because they are 
still hiding out. 
 
THE WITNESS: If you just go through your regular routine and 
try to get in touch with me instead of going out in front of the 
camera.  Go ahead. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, if you wouldn't --  
 
THE WITNESS: I wouldn't what? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Duck service. 
 
THE WITNESS: No, I never ducked service.  Don't even try that.  
You got in front of that camera --   
 
MR. RE: Come on, come on.  Mr. Petrocelli, the record is very 
clear -- 
 
THE WITNESS: He's an asshole. 
 
MR. RE: -- that you went out and said that he was ducking service 
at a time when nobody had called me and even asked to have him 
appear.  As soon as anybody called and asked to have him appear, 
we made him available and he was willing to accept service.  He 
certainly is not ducking service, and there is no real need to get 
into  that. He is available--  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I didn't get into it. 
 
MR. RE: Well, you just did. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No, he got into it. 
 
MR. RE: You got into it.  He is available.  He has made himself --  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am glad that he will voluntarily appear and 
accept service of a trial subpoena, and that's all that needs to be 
said. 
 
MR. RE: Okay, fine.

Q: And what movies have those been? 
 
A: Worked on a cable show called "1st and 10," did some work -- 
extra work on a couple of features: CAPRICORN, DETOUR 
 
Q: DETOUR TO TERROR, was that the name of it? 
 
A: I guess. It was a TV program -- it was a movie for TV. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, "lst and 10," that was a show that Mr. Simpson was 
involved in --   
 
A: Right.

Q: Okay. But in terms of being paid as an extra on the 
CAPRICORN set, Mr. Simpson arranged that for you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And with DETOUR TO TERROR, the same m thing: Did Mr. 
Simpson arrange for you to be part of that set? 
 
A: Yes.  By that time I had did a lot of stand-in work for O.J., and 
so it was an ongoing thing during the off-season when he worked 
on films or commercials and required a stand-in, I would be his 
stand-in. 
 
Q: What do you mean by being a "stand-in"? 
 
A: They check the lights and stuff.  You stand in his spot where 
they going to actually shoot the film -- 
 
MR. RE: You really are from the Midwest. 
 
MR. KELLY: That's right. 
 
THE WITNESS: --  and you stand there --  
 
MR. KELLY: Rural Midwest, obviously. 
 
THE WITNESS: -- and they work and figure out the camera angle 
and the lighting and all, and once they get that situated, then you 
step off camera and he stands -- he comes in there and starts 
reading his lines. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  You never -- and excuse my Midwest upbringing -- you 
never served as a second for Mr. Simpson in any movie or show, 
did you? 
 
A: What do you mean by "second"? 
 
Q: See, that's Midwest talk that you guys don't know. 
 
A: I gave you "stand-in." 
 
Q: Where you were appearing as Mr. Simpson, say, as a stunt or an 
action shot or a distance shot? 
 
A: No, only -- a distance shot in some things, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever work at having to be able to walk like Mr. 
Simpson or have his demeanor in any way? 
 
A: From a distance. 
 
Q: Okay.  And DETOUR TO TERROR -- I think I asked you this -- 
he arranged for you to be on that set also? 
 
A: Yeah.  Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And what was your involvement with that movie? 
 
A: Stand-in. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall whether Nicole was part of that set also?

A: Nicole was an extra. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall what she was an extra for, what particular 
scenes or anything?

bus a lot.  She sat on as one of the passengers on the bus. 
 
Q: Do you recall whether there was something she ever had to get 
made up for? 
 
A: No, I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did you ever see Nicole being made up at all for the movie 
DETOUR TO TERROR? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know.  I don't remember. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Looking back, do you recall any scene in DETOUR TO 
TERROR where any passengers on that bus were injured at all? 
 
A: I would think so.  It was -- like I say, it was overtaken by 
terrorists or some robbers or whatever, so they probably had some 
people made up to look like they were injured or shot. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall yourself whether Nicole was ever made up 
this way? 
 
A: I don't remember 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Asked and answered. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: I am sorry. What was your answer? 
 
A: I don't remember.

the movie? 
 
A: Did I what? 
 
Q: Did you see Nicole actually -- 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: -- appear in the film? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: She was in it? 
 
A: Yeah, she was in it. 
 
Q: Okay.  And could you tell me how long ago this was? 
 
A: It was a long time ago.  I can't give you an exact date.  I think it 
was- let's see.  It could have been -- whenever O.J. had his 
production company is when, because he -- it came through his 
production company. 
 
Q: That's Orenthal Productions?    
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay.  Were there any other investments or businesses Mr. 
Simpson got you involved in? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Compound. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Were there any other investments Mr. Simpson got you 
involved in? 
 
A: When did he ever get me in any investments? 
 
Q: I don't know whether he did or not.  Did he? 
 
A: No, he didn't. 
 
Q: Did you ever invest or -- I don't want to ask you a compound 
question.  Were you ever a partner of Mr. Simpson's in any 
business venture? 
 
A: We had some business opportunities that we --but nothing ever 
developed.  I mean, what I'm saying, I mean, it was more in the 
starting-up stages, but it never really matured into anything. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you know -- Mr. Simpson's first wife's name, her first 
name was Marquerite? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you recall what her maiden name was? 
 
A: Weeklia -- Week -- started with a W.  It's been a long time. 
 
Q: Okay.  And when did you first meet Marquerite? 
 
A: In high school. 
 
Q: Okay. And how long did you know her before she met Mr. 
Simpson? 
 
A: I don't know.  Could have been a couple months before. 
 
Q: Okay.  And as I understand, it was you who introduced her to 
Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: Yes.  Marquerite and I were dating, and I introduced her to O.J. 
 
Q: And how long did she and Mr. Simpson date before they 
married, if you recall, approximately? 
 
A: I don't know.  Could have been a year, year and a half.  I don't 
know how long, you know, it went. 
 
Q: Did you attend their wedding?    
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did they have a large wedding or a small wedding? 
 
A: It was --  
 
Q: Medium? 
   
A: It was a wedding. 
   
Q: Okay. Were you in the wedding party?

BY MR. KELLY:

was going with at that time. 
 
Q: That first year? 
 
A: First year or first two years.  
 
Q: How do you know that?

Francisco to meet with O.J. and Nicole.

with -- 
 
A: No, no, no. I didn't say they.  I said Lou.

Q: Oh, you did. 
 
A: I was -- they claimed me off of waivers, and I went up to -- no; 
no, I take that back.  No, no, no.  I'm going too fast.  When I 
finished with the Rams, I went to Canada. 
 
Q: To play football? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: With which team up there?    
 
A: Montreal Allouettes.

Q: Was it a ligament or meniscus? 
 
A: It was a ligament. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you have surgery immediately? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And you mentioned the Seahawks.  What happened with 
them? 
 
A: No.  The first -- I got released by the Rams.  I was claimed by 
the Seahawks and went there, I didn't like it and came back and re-
signed with the Rams. 
 
Q: What did you do, just go to summer ball with them? 
 
A: No. As a matter of fact, I played a league game with them, the 
first game of the year, and I didn't like Seattle, so I asked for my 
release. 
 
Q: And they gave it to you? 
 
A: Yes.    
 
Q: Okay. 
 
MR.BREWER: Take five minutes here, John? 
 
MR. KELLY: Sure.  You want to take a break now? 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 11:09. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Mr. Cowlings, when we let off, I think we were discussing the 
end of your pro football career.  Is that correct? 
 
A: Whatever the question was. 
 
MR. KELLY: Actually, could we have the question read back? 
 
(Record read.) 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. All night.  Earlier I had been asking you about some 
questions about Lou Brown.  Do you recall that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And you had indicated that you knew yourself that Mr. 
Simpson had met Judy Brown, Nicole's mother, before Simpson 
had ever met Lou Brown.  Is that correct also? 
 
A: I didn't say -- I didn't know if they met, but I knew she knew 
who Nicole was going with. 
 
Q: Okay. When did you first meet Judy Brown? 
 
A: Probably the same time I met Lou and had -- probably would 
have been the fall of '79, I think. 
 
Q: Was that up in San Francisco? 
 
A: No.  That would have been here in Los Angeles. 
 
Q: Okay.  And in general terms could you tell me what type of 
person Judy Brown -- 
 
A: Very nice. 
 
Q: -- is? You have a good relationship with her? 
 
A: I think up to a point.  I don't think about now.

Q: Prior to June 12th, 1994, did you have a very good relationship 
with Judy Brown?

there? 
 
A: No

A: That she think that he had committed the murders. 
 
Q: Do you know whether that was immediately after the murders 
or not, meaning the first couple days? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you know whether it was during the course of the 
trial that you spoke to her about this?

Q: And she said that to you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you recall where you were when she said this to you? 
 
A: At their house. 
 
Q: Was that sometime where you were down to visit the kids or 
something? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Okay.  And do you recall exactly what she said to you? 
 
A: She would ask me, do I still think that he was innocent, and I 
would say yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And then would she say something else to you? 
 
A: And she will say, "How could you?" 
 
Q: Did she give you any specific reasons why she thought he was 
guilty? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  When was the first time you met Denise Brown, Nicole's 
sister?

the film ended up in New York, and O.J. and Nicole, Denise, her 
boyfriend and myself went to a play. 
 
Q: What film was that you were working on? 
 
A: What was that.  It was with Sophia Loren.  What was it called. 
FIRE POWER, I think.  FIREPOWER.

Simpson had killed Nicole and Ron Goldman? 
 
A: Telling me personally?    
 
Q: Yeah, speaking to you.    
 
A: She may have. 
 
Q: Do you recall approximately when? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: No, I don't -- a lot of times when I went down, 
Denise wasn't in, so I didn't see her that much. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Were there times you did see her, though? 
 
A: For Justy's -- when he got baptized, she was there. 
 
Q: When Justin was baptized?    
 
A: Yeah, in Laguna. 
 
Q: Okay.  How long ago was that? 
 
A: I guess in the last year, if not -- no.  No.  It had to be longer than 
that.  Last year and a half, I guess. 
 
Q: Did you have any discussions with her regarding --  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- Mr. Simpson's involvement in Nicole's murder or not? 
 
A: No.  The only discussions I would have is with Judy or Lou.

BY MR. KELLY:    
 
Q: -- in that --    
 
MR. LEONARD: Sorry.  Go ahead.    
 
MR. KELLY: You've got to give me a chance to be more vague 
before I finish the question. 
 
Q: Did you spend much time with Mr. Simpson during the year 
1979 after you finished playing pro football?    
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Vague.    
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Could you tell me who were some of the friends you and Mr. 
Simpson would spend time with together? 
 
A: I played a lot of tennis with various -- number of people.  A lot 
of people used to come by O.J.'s house. 
 
Q: Where? At Rockingham? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And this was in '79? 
 
A: A lot.  Even before '79 and after '79. 
 
Q: Was Marquerite living there at that time? 
 
A: I think Marquerite was -- could have been at the house at that 
time.  I think she was still staying -- living there while he was in 
San Francisco. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: Oh, okay. '79.  Oh, no.  He had gotten Nicole an apartment at 
Westwood, so he was spending a lot of time there. 
 
Q: At Westwood? 
 
A: Right, wherever her apartment was.  No, no.  I think -- 
Westwood, yeah -- no, no.  This -- the other apartment was in 
Beverly Hills.  That's the one in '79. 
 
Q: Are we talking about Nicole's apartment? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was he living with Nicole at that time? 
 
A: They were spending a lot of time.  I don't know if he was living 
there all the time, though. 
 
Q: Okay. Did he have his own place also, other than Rockingham? 
 
A: Just, I mean, Rockingham. 
 
Q: Did he live there while Marquerite was there? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Okay.  But you recall being over there when Marquerite was 
staying there still? 
 
A: No. No. No.  In '79, no. 
 
Q: Okay.  So you and Simpson wouldn't play tennis there -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- with your buddies when Marquerite was still there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Prior to Marquerite moving out of Rockingham, when 
you and Simpson were still in L A., could you give me the names 
of some of the people you used to hang out with? 
 
A: Hang out with? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Or come by the house? 
 
Q: No.  Hang out with. 
 
A: There was a lot of people. 
 
Q: Give me what you would consider yours and Simpson's closest 
friends during that period of time. 
 
A: O.J. had a lot of people.  I mean, wasn't my friends -- I mean, 
people who came by to see O.J., not me.  I just --  
 
Q: I am not talking about Rockingham.  When you would go out at 
night or something, you and Simpson together, who else would be 
with you? 
 
A: If O.J. went out prior to that, he was with his wife.  If I 
happened to have a date, I would go out with them. 
 
Q: Okay.  Wasn't he going out with Nicole during that time period 
also? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you ever go out with he and Nicole? 
 
A: They didn't go out that much. 
 
Q: He and Nicole didn't go out that much? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  But he had gotten her the apartment in Westwood? 
 
A: Right.  They would go to the movies, but they wouldn't like go 
out, you know, because he was still -- at that time still married to 
Marquerite. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you know who Simpson's -- By the way, in '79 would 
you consider Simpson your closest friend at that time? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And in your mind were you Simpson's closest friend? 
 
A: I was -- yeah, I guess. 
 
Q: Okay.  Could you tell me, other than yourself, who you viewed 
as Mr. Simpson's close friends at that time? 
 
A: O.J.-a lot of people would make themselves available to O.J. as 
friendships.  He had -- it was a lot of people.  I couldn't pinpoint 
who O.J. felt was closest to him.  O.J. was a very warm, open 
person. He was very easy to approach. 
 
Q: Did you know [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Could you give me -- was there a particular crowd you 
would associate [Name Deleted] with during that time period? 
 
A: We would frequent [Name Deleted]'s restaurant.  [Name 
Deleted] had a restaurant in West Los Angeles on Pico called 
[Name Deleted]'s.  His relationship with [Name Deleted] stems 
back to when [Name Deleted] worked for the Luau years before. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was there a particular group of people that you would 
hang out with during that period, say, at [Name Deleted]'s? 
 
A: Well, [Name Deleted]'s place was -- had good food, good 
atmosphere, and a lot of times you see a lot of the same faces.  I 
couldn't pinpoint, you know, names. 
 
Q: Who would Simpson go there with? 
 
A: Him and Nicole would go there.  That was one of the few places 
they would go. 
 
Q: Would they go with other people, other than you? 
 
A: No.  They would be there by themselves a lot. 
 
Q: So you can't tell me, other than yourself, who you considered 
Mr. Simpson's close 1  friends at that time? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know who O.J. considered his close 
friends. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: I know.  I am asking you. 
 
A: I don't know.  He never voiced how he rated his friends to me. 
 
Q: But were there any particular individuals he'd spend more time 
with than others? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: At what age did you start -- did you first meet Mr. Simpson? 
How old were you? 
 
A: I don't know.  I was in the third grade, something like that. 
 
Q: Okay. You knew him through high school? 
 
A: Grade school we knew -- I knew of him. 
 
Q: You spent time together during grade school? 
 
A: No. We went to the same grade school.  We actually didn't start 
becoming friends until junior high school. 
 
Q: Okay.  And you spent a lot of time with him then? 
 
A: Yeah.  We lived in the same neighborhood. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you ever see him in any fist fights? 
 
A: O.J. didn't fight a lot, no. 
 
Q: No? 
 
A: O.J. was boisterous. 
 
Q: Okay.  Never saw him in a fight?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you consider him a tough guy during that time 
period, high school? 
 
A: Yeah --  
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Vague.    
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: I am sorry? 
 
A: I -- yeah, O.J. probably could hold his own in a fight. 
 
Q: Okay.  You never saw him hold his own, though, in a fight? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you say he was "boisterous," did you ever see him talk 
himself out of a fight situation? 
 
A: I've seen O.J. fight -- talk himself out of a lot of situations. 
 
Q: I am talking about fight situations now during that time period 
like in high school. 
 
A: O.J. had an air about him that people -- he could, you know -- 
people didn't want to mess with O.J. 
 
Q: He's a good talker, huh?  
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: Well, talker, his appearance, because at that time 
O.J. had a Fu Manchu, and he looked a lot older than his age, so he 
was not to be messed with. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What's the time frame here? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: We are talking high school?  
 
A: Junior high, high school. 
 
A: Junior high and high school?  
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Were you in a gang during any of that time period? 
 
A: Yeah, we were in a social gang.  
 
Q: What was the name of that? 
 
A: The Superiors. 
 
Q: When you say you saw O.J. talk himself out of a lot of 
situations, could you have --  
 
A: No, I didn't say a lot of situations.    
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Quote, "Saw OJ talk himself out of lots of 
situations." 
 
THE WITNESS: Okay. Lots of situations, yeah. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Could you tell me some situations you saw Simpson talk 
himself out of? 
 
A: Things -- nothing out of the ordinary.  Just, you know, young 
guy stuff.    
 
Q: Such as?    
 
A: Flirting.    
 
Q: Flirting with other guys' gals?    
 
A: No.  Just flirting with girls. 
 
Q: Why would he have to talk himself out of flirting with girls? 
 
A: You know, like, "Did you say this about me?"  "No, I didn't say 
it," and he probably did say it, and he probably talked his way out 
of it. 
 
Q: Double-talking the girls?    
 
A: Yeah, probably. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you ever see him talk his way out of any situations 
with cops? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Never? 
 
A: We got arrested, but I don't know what he said and what I -- 
what he had said to the police. 
 
Q: What did you get arrested for? 
 
A: We didn't get arrested. We got stopped.  A friend of ours got 
into an altercation with a bus driver.  We were on the same bus, 
and he got -- the   bus driver got hit, and we got off the bus, and I 
said, "We should go."  And he said, "No.  We haven't done 
anything." 
 
Q: Wait.  The bus driver got hit by a car or by a person? 
 
A: No.  He got hit by a person. 
 
Q: That you were with? 
 
A: Yeah, that we were with, a high school chum. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: And O.J. suggested that we stay.  And it was a good thing that 
we did because when the police finally came, they were talking to 
a few of the witnesses there, and they just said, "Well, there was 
about three or four of them that jumped the bus driver, which was 
not true, and luckily there was one lady there -- no.  The first lady, 
she pointed at us, and this other lady said, "No, they had nothing to 
do with it," so it was a good thing that we did wait. 
 
Q: And did Simpson actually talk to the cops? 
 
A: Yes.  They took us down and questioned us. 
 
Q: Okay.  Together? 
 
A: No. They took O.J. in one room and me in the other. 
 
Q: Okay. As a result of the conversation that you had with the 
cops, you weren't arrested.  Correct? 
 
A: No.  Neither one -- either one of us wasn't arrested.  We were let 
go. 
 
Q: Okay. And how old were you at that time? 
 
A: I guess about 17. 
 
Q: Okay. What other times did you see Simpson talk himself out of 
situations? 
 
A: No, a lot of times O.J. wouldn't have to talk himself out.  I 
mean, O.J. was very liked by the teachers and by the students, and 
if he got into a problem, they would call him down and sit and talk 
with him, and all would be forgotten.  We used to tease him about 
it. 
 
Q: Tease him about what? 
 
A: That, you know, if we ran the ball like he did, we probably 
would get off, too. 
 
Q: You think he was shown a little preference because of his 
football ability? 
 
A: Oh, yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you consider him a very smooth talker also? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: No, not really. I mean, you know, he was -- for 
what O.J. accomplished there at Galileo and what -- you know, O.J. 
wasn't a bad person. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: I am not asking that.  Actually what I am asking you is: In 
response to a question, you said you had seen Simpson talk himself 
out of lots of situations. 
 
A: Yeah, he talked himself with me or with anybody.  I mean, O.J. 
is a great kidder.  He likes to have -- he likes to, you know, to do 
things for a 1augh.    
 
Q: Were there times he got you ticked off? 
 
A: He'll pull a practical joke on me or something like that. 
 
Q: All right.  I guess in general you considered him a good talker, 
though.  Would that be fair to say? 
 
A: Yeah, O.J. --  
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection, vague.  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: I am sorry? 
 
A: He could talk. 
 
Q: Good talker? 
 
A: He could talk. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Now, at USC and with the Bills, I assume you got to know 
Simpson's temperament very well --  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- in terms of on the football field and off it. Is that correct? 
 
A: Yes, uh-huh. 
 
Q: Could you describe his basic game day temperament to me? 
 
A: Very low key, quiet, didn't show a lot of emotion, and he just 
turned it up -- I mean turned -- his performance did most of his 
talking.  O.J. -- 
 
Q: Okay.  He wasn't --  
 
A: No, he wasn't a boisterous person.  He wasn't, "Hey, we got to 
get going" or "Let's get fired up" O.J. stayed within his self. 
 
Q: Okay. Even for big games? 
 
A: Even for big games.  That's -- that helps, you know, because 
when things are on the line and every -- you know, most guys are 
very emotional, but O.J. always stayed within, kept a calmness 
about him, and everybody gelled around that. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was he always in control prior to starting the game? 
 
A: Yeah, seemed to be. 
 
Q: And always the same even temperament? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Always calm, 
 
A: Uh-huh.   
 
Q: Always cool? 
 
A: Uh-huh.  Yes.  I'm sorry.  Yes. Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And in your opinion was always in control? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What about in actual game situations, and I am talking about 
once a game had started, was he always under control during these 
periods also?    
 
A: Seemed to be.  And I played defense; he played offense, so I 
wasn't out there on the field in the huddle, so I don't know exactly 
what was going on in the huddle, but from appearance-wise, from 
the sidelines and from when he came off the field, he was all -- you 
didn't know if he was hurting or you didn't know if he was upset.  
He just kept up a very --  
 
Q: Would it be fair to say he was always even keeled? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Wasn't a big talker? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Kept most things to himself during the games -- 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: -- also?  
 
A: Uh-huh.    
 
Q: Okay.  Did his performance --     
 
A: His performance was extremely -- you know, he did his job. 
 
Q: Okay.  And that did his talking for him: His work on the field? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Would it be fair to say that he was a go-to player also in 
clutch situations? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Had a good set of nerves? 
   
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Very good set of nerves? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. Vague. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know about nerves, but he was a great 
performer.  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  You never saw him lose his cool in a tight situation on 
the field, did you.? 
 
A: I haven't, no. 
 
Q: Okay. Would you consider him quick thinking? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Vague.  
 
THE WITNESS: He could think. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Would you consider Mr. Simpson a quick thinker? 
 
A: When you say quick thinker, what are you saying? 
 
Q: Well, good reactions to situations.    
 
A: On the field? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Well, you can't think on the field. You think, the game -- the 
play is over.  You have got to react. 
 
Q: You react. Would you consider him a good reactor? 
 
A: Yeah, his reactions were very good. 
 
Q: Okay.  And in post-game situations, could you describe his 
general temperament to me then? 
 
A: Even keel. 
 
Q: Win or lose? 
   
A: I mean, he was upset if they lost.  I mean, you know, nobody 
likes to lose. 
 
Q: Right. 
 
A: But he didn't show any more emotions than out of the ordinary. 
 
Q: Okay.  Would it be fair to say that he had extraordinary foot 
speed? 
 
A: He was very fast. 
 
Q: Okay.  Strong hands?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  He wasn't a fumbler, was he?    
 
A: He did fumble. 
 
Q: He wasn't known as a fumbler though? 
 
A: If you get hit, you'll fumble. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did he ever drop a pass?    
 
A: Did I? 
 
Q: Did Mr. Simpson ever drop a pass? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What if I told you Mr. Simpson had testified that he had never 
dropped a pass that he can recall?  Is that true or false? 
 
A: That's --  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: In a game. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: In a game. 
 
A: Well, he may say it was a bad pass from the quarterback.  I 
don't know.  
 
Q: Or he's got a bad recollection? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Okay. You recall him dropping passes in games, don't you? 
 
A: It looked like to me. 
 
Q: Let me ask you, when Mr. Simpson was playing with Buffalo, 
did you ever see him run right over large linemen, like 300 pound 
linemen? 
 
A: I mean, some -- on some incidents you have no choice.  I mean, 
he's gotten -- he has taken some licks. 
 
Q: Yeah. Have you ever seen him give some licks, too? 
 
A: Yeah, you got to.  You know, you got to be able to defend 
yourself. 
 
Q: I am asking, did you ever see him run right over a defensive 
lineman? 
 
A: O.J. was more elusive than bowl over somebody.  That wasn't 
his style. 
 
Q: Did you ever see him do it, though? 
 
A: I've seen goal-line situations, short-yard situations where you 
only need two or three yards, where he'll go up the middle.  It 
wasn't too many people that could take him on one-on-one in the 
open field. 
 
Q: Did you ever see him shed linebackers or cornerbacks that got 
hold of him? 
 
A: If they don't got a good hold onto him, he could break their 
tackle. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall, other than his knee injury at the end of his 
Buffalo career, where he ever missed a game due to an injury? 
 
A: I only played three years with him in Buffalo, so I don't know 
prior to -- I mean after that what happened.  I knew in my three 
year -- the three years I was there, he suffered a knee injury that put 
him out for the rest of the season. 
 
Q: Other than that knee injury, do you remember him missing any 
other game due to an injury? 
 
A: Like I say, I was only there for three years, so I don't know what 
happened after that. 
 
Q: But I'm saying, during those three years, other than that knee 
injury, do you remember any other time he missed a game due to 
an injury? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay. Simpson didn't baby himself at all during football, did 
he? 
 
A: "Baby," what do you mean by that? 
 
Q:  Baby himself.  Like would he play through the pain, or would 
he take himself out if he was hurting at all? 
 
A: O.J. was very strong, very -- had great endurance. 
 
Q: Would it be --  
 
A: Carried the ball a lot.  Couldn't have been a baby if he carried 
the ball a lot. 
 
Q: Would he generally carry it 30 or more times a game? 
 
A: I don't know the exact number, but he carried the ball a lot. 
 
Q: Okay.  And your general impression was he wouldn't just pull 
himself out whenever he was hurt a little bit or not feeling good? 
 
A: During the course of a battle, you know, you don't have time to 
think, so you do what you have to do.  That's your job. 
 
Q: Playing on adrenaline? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall when Marquerite moved out of 
Rockingham and O.J. moved in there? 
 
A: I guess that would have been in the fall of '79, I guess. 
 
Q: Do you have a general recollection of that time period? 
 
A: I don't know the exact date. 
 
Q: But it was end of '79, early '80, when --  
 
A: Yeah, something like that, I guess. 
 
Q: Okay.  And do you recall whether Nicole moved into 
Rockingham at that same time? 
 
A: I couldn't tell you if she moved exactly right in, but I know 
eventually she did. 
 
Q: Within a year? 
 
A: It could have been. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you spend a lot of time there at Rockingham after 
Nicole and Simpson were living there? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  You played a lot of tennis there during that time period? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Could you tell me who Nicole and Simpson's inner 
circle of friends were during that time period, now that they were 
in Rockingham? 
 
A: '79... I don't know the time frame.  I mean, like I said, there's a 
lot of people that O.J. is acquainted with and friends with that 
would frequent the house --  
 
Q: I know, but did he not have --  
 
A: I would say --  
 
Q: Go ahead, Mr. Cowlings.  You were saying something. 
 
A: I don't know if it was '79 or '80 or '81[Names Deleted] when she 
came into town, her boyfriend, who -- I don't know his name, they 
basically went out -- when him and Nicole moved into the house, 
they would basically go out with other couples. 
 
Q: Can you think of any other couples, other than [Names 
Deleted]and Kardashians maybe? 
 
A: It came across -- I don't know if Chris and Bob was married 
then.  It could have been.  I know they were friends. Bob was a 
close friend of O.J.'s.  I mean, as years went on, I mean, there was 
other couples.  Are you still talking about that particular time 
frame? 
 
Q: Yeah, when they moved in, before they got married and before 
Sydney. 
 
A: There was quite a few people that have come and gone, you 
know. 
 
Q: I am talking about that time period, if you can remember 
anybody else. 
 
A: That's -- those are the ones that stand out to me. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you include the Kardashians in that? 
 
A: I was trying to -- I don't know if Bob and Chris were married 
then.  That I couldn't tell you.  I couldn't tell you because the only 
ones I'm familiar with that I know that they would go out was the 
ones that I just mentioned. 
 
Q: Okay.  After Nicole and Simpson got m married in '85, do you 
know whether their group of friends changed at all then? 
 
A: No, it seemed like it stayed the same.  I mean, it was always 
new friends.  People were always -- you know, wanted to be 
associated with O.J. 
 
Q: Okay. Can you think of any other couples that sprung up later 
on in the '80s besides the Kehoes and Schwartzes -- 
 
A: They were together for eight years, so there's a lot of -- you 
know, I think [Names Deleted].  Business associates of his that 
O.J. has done business with over the years, I guess when they came 
into town with their wives, you know, either stayed there or would 
be -- you know, if they were there for a week or two weeks -- I 
mean a weekend, you know, they would come by O.J.'s and they 
would go out to dinner. 
 
Q: Do you know when Simpson first became friendly with Marcus 
Allen? 
 
A: Would have been -- Marcus was an athlete at USC.  I don't 
know if O.J. helped in recruiting Marcus to USC. 
 
Q: Did you? 
 
A: No, I didn't. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you know Allen when he was at USC? 
 
A: Yes. As a matter of fact, I was introduced to him at O.J.'s. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you ever work with the USC team after you had 
retired from pro football? 
 
A: I did some help in recruiting at the time when they allowed 
alumnae to help out.  Then after SC came under -- 
 
Q: The good old days? 
 
A: Hey, I thought you were from the Midwest. 
 
Q: I am.  Someone told me to say that.  They whispered it to me. 
 
A: No.  Then SC got into trouble with the recruiting violations; 
they was on probation.  So you can't do any of that now. 
 
Q: Okay.  Getting back to Allen, do you recall when you first met 
him? 
 
A: It would have probably been around that time, but I don't know 
if he was a sophomore or freshman, but I remember meeting him.  
He would come by O.J.'s. 
 
Q: Okay.  So he knew Simpson during that time when he was at 
USC? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And did you see him often there during his playing days 
at USC? 
 
A: Yeah, Marcus would come around, and him and I became 
friends. 
 
Q: Okay. Have you maintained that friendship to this day? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay.  When was the last time you spoke to him? 
 
A: I haven't spoken to Marcus in two or three months, I guess. 
 
Q: Okay.  Have you ever had any conversations with Marcus 
regarding Nicole since the murders? 
 
MR. RE: Excluding that period? 
 
MR. KELLY: Excluding that period. 
 
MR. RE: Want to --  
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah. 
 
MR. KELLY: Want to take a break? 
 
MR. RE: Yeah.

regarding Nicole since the murders?)

BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: And could you tell me when the first time you talked to Marcus 
Allen after Nicole's murder was? 
 
MR. RE: Excluding the time period we're talking about. 
 
MR. KELLY: Excluding the time period. 
 
THE WITNESS: I told Marcus that I knew of his relationship with 
Nicole, and I was speaking to him as a friend, because I said, 
"There's a strong possibility, Marcus, that her friends know, and it 
may come out in court.  Would you want [Name Deleted] to find 
out through the papers, or better that you tell her." 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  When did you have this conversation? 
 
A: This would have been, I don't know, a couple weeks after. 
 
MR. RE: Sort of at the end of the period of exclusion. 
 
MR. KELLY: We just made it? 
 
MR. RE: You're just under the wire.    
 
MR. KELLY: We snuck in with this conversation, fortunately. 
 
Q: Were you talking to him in person? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And where did this meeting take place? 
 
A: .At a friend's house. 
 
Q: Okay.  And who was the friend? 
 
A: [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: Okay. [Name Deleted] was a longtime friend of yours, wasn't 
he? 
   
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And he is along-time friend of Simpson's also? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was he a long-time friend of Marcus Allen's? 
 
A: He hasn't known Marcus as long as he's known O.J. and I. 
 
Q: Okay.  Marcus is a lot younger than O.J. and you also, isn't he? 
 
A: Yes. Right. 
 
Q: Okay.  [Name Deleted] is a big USC supporter? 
 
A: He's a friend. 
 
Q: Okay. But you knew him through a USC connection, didn't 
you? 
 
A: Yeah, we got introduced to [Name Deleted] my first year at SC. 
 
Q: Okay.  And who was present at this conversation between you 
and Marcus? 
 
A: Just Marcus and I.   
 
Q: [Name Deleted] wasn't present there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know who else was in the house -- 
 
A: It was outside.  I'm sorry. 
 
Q: Who was present in the house besides [Name Deleted] when 
you had this conversation? 
 
A: Marcus and I were outside.    
 
Q: Okay. In the driveway? 
 
A: Excuse me? 
 
Q: Where outside the house? 
 
A: By the corrals, horse barn or horse corrals. 
 
Q: Okay.  And how did it come about that you were meeting at 
[Name Deleted]' house? 
 
A: There was a family function there for [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: Okay. And you had been invited by [Name Deleted]? 
   
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And Marcus had been invited? 
 
A: Him and [Name Deleted], yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Had you talked to Marcus after the murders and prior to 
this day you saw him there? 
 
MR. RE: Well that would obviously be within the time of 
exclusion, so I am advising him to assert a privilege as to any 
conversation before that day. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. Starting June 12th? 
 
MR. RE: For about a period of two weeks.  We are not sure when 
this is, but we are letting this one come in. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
Q: Now, what was -- how long did you talk to Marcus for? 
 
A: We talked for -- I don't know how long.  I didn't want to draw 
any suspicion from anyone there.  You know, we just --  
 
Q: But you and Marcus were talking alone, the two of you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you were out by the corrals alone? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Okay.  And how long were you out there for? 
 
A: Could have been maybe 15, 20 minutes. 
 
Q: Okay.  What did you talk about other than the fact that you 
knew that he had been having an affair with Nicole? 
 
A: What he was going to tell his wife. 
 
Q: Okay.  What did he tell you he was going to tell his wife? 
 
A: He was somewhat -- he was just bothered, upset, probably 
confused. 
 
Q: Did you also talk to him at that time about who may have 
murdered Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever discuss Mr. Simpson at all with Marcus that day? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever discuss whether Mr. Simpson had murdered 
Nicole and Ron Goldman, at all with Marcus that day? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Is it your testimony today that you had no discussion with 
Marcus regarding the facts and circumstances around Nicole's 
murder, that day? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Yes, that is your testimony? 
 
A: That day, yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  After that day can you tell me the next time you spoke to 
Marcus Allen? 
 
A: I spoke on the phone a few times from Kansas City. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you call him or did he call you? 
 
A: We called each other. 
 
Q: Okay.  Could you tell me the substance of those conversations? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did you ever discuss his relationship with Nicole in any of 
those conversations? 
 
A: Not since that day. 
 
Q: At [Name Deleted]' house. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did you ever discuss with Marcus Allen Mr. Simpson's possible 
involvement with the murders of Nicole and Ron? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You've never had that conversation with him to this day? 
 
A: When you say "involvement," how are you saying that? 
 
Q: Have you ever had any conversations with Marcus Allen in 
which you discussed -- either you or Marcus discussed Mr. 
Simpson's possible involvement in the murder of Nicole Brown 
Simpson? 
 
A: When you say "involvement," as he being accused? 
 
Q: No. Of him committing the murder. 
 
A: No, not to my recollection.  I remember we may have spoke 
about the death of Nicole and O.J. being accused. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did Marcus ever indicate to you at any time that he 
thought Mr. Simpson had murdered Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever express to Marcus Allen at any time that you 
thought Mr. Simpson may have murdered Nicole? 
   
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. When was the last time you spoke to Marcus Allen? 
 
A: I spoke to him I guess about maybe two months ago, maybe a 
little longer. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you call him, or did he call you? 
 
A: He called me. 
 
Q: Do you know where he called you from? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know whether he was in Los Angeles -- 
 
A: No, I take that back.  He called, and I wasn't home. He left a 
number, and I called back. It could have been in Kansas City. 
 
Q: Okay. Could you tell me whet that number was? 
 
A: No, I don't remember it. 
 
Q When you say, "He left a number," how was it left for you? 
 
A: "Hey, man, this is Marcus.  How you doing, blah, blah, blah, 
 Hoping to catch you." 
 
Q: Was this on an answering machine? 
 
A: On my voice mail, yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. Would you be able to recall that number now on your 
voice mail still? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Could you tell me what Marcus Allen's address in Kansas City 
is presently? 
   
A: No, I couldn't tell you. I don't know his address. 
 
Q: Do you know whether he is living in Kansas City or Los 
Angeles? 
 
A: I don't think he's in Los Angeles. 
 
Q: Why don't you think that? 
 
A: I don't think Marcus has been back to Los Angeles. 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
A: You have to ask him that. 
 
Q: I am asking you why you don't think he's been back --  
 
A: I have no --  
 
Q: You've got to let me finish my questions, Mr. Cowlings.  Why 
do you not think he's been back to Los Angeles? 
 
MR. RE: Wait a second.  Are you asking him what Marcus' 
motivation is, or why is it that he believes he is not here? 
 
MR. KELLY: I am asking Mr. Cowlings from his own personal 
knowledge why he believes Marcus Allen is not in Los Angeles 
now. 
 
MR. RE: Do you mean why Marcus Allen is not coming back, 
what his motivation is --  
  
MR. KELLY: No, I didn't say anything about --  
 
MR. RE: -- or why he thinks that he is not present in Los Angeles? 
 
MR. KELLY:  No.  I am just asking him why he personally has an 
opinion that Mr. Allen is not residing in Los Angeles at this time. 
 
MR.RE: Why does he think he's someplace else? 
 
MR. KELLY: Yeah. 
 
Q: Why do you think he's some place other than Los Angeles?  
Thank you, Mr. Re. 
 
A: I wouldn't know. I mean, I don't know what reasons Marcus-his 
reasons for not being here. 
 
Q: I am not asking the reason why.  Just do you know for a fact he 
is not living in Los Angeles right now? 
 
A: He's not here. 
 
Q: How do you know he's not here? 
 
A: Because he hasn't been here. 
 
Q: How do you know he hasn't been here? 
 
A: I think he would have called me and said, "A.C., I'm in town." 
 
Q: Okay. So that's the basis for thinking that he is not in Los 
Angeles --  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: -- because he hasn't called you?    
 
A: Right. Okay. 
 
Q: And you don't have a number to reach him here in Los Angeles? 
 
A: His house -- the house he owns is still here. 
 
Q: And where is that? 
 
A: It's in Pacific Palisades. 
 
Q: Okay.  And what street is that on?  
 
A: It's on -- it's right off of Amalfi.  I forget the name of the street. 
Starts with a V, I think. 
 
Q: Do you have it written down somewhere? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You know it by sight?    
 
A: Oh, yeah. 
 
Q: Okay.  But you don's keep Marcus' address anywhere? 
 
A: I may have written it down some time ago but not recently. 
 
Q: Would you have it somewhere still, since you wrote it down a 
while ago? 
 
A: His address?    
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: It could be in an old phone book of mine. 
 
Q: Would you be able to provide it to your attorney, Mr. Re, and 
he could provide it to us within a reasonable period of time? 
 
A: The police has my phone book. 
 
Q: They do.  And that's where it'd be?    
 
A: I would assume if it's written down, it would be in my old 
phone book. 
 
Q: Okay.  You haven't written anything, since that other phone 
book was seized by the police, in terms of Marcus Allen's address 
or phone numbers? 
 
A: I have numbers which -- I had to recoup a lot of the numbers 
that I was unable to get because they still have my phone book. 
 
Q: Okay. So have you started a new phone book? 
 
A: I have pieces of papers. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you have a piece of paper somewhere with phone 
numbers for Marcus Allen? 
 
MR. RE: Let me do it this way:  He will check.  If we find it, we'll 
give it to you. Is that all right? 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. Address and phone number. 
 
MR. RE: Whatever he has, I mean, we will give it to you.  What 
we are doing now is chasing around whether he has it.  I don't think 
he knows whether he has it. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
Q: Is that all right with you, Mr. Cowlings? 
 
A: Yes, sir. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know any place that Allen would stay in Los 
Angeles, other than the house we were discussing before, when 
he's here? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you -- have any mutual friends of yours and Allen's 
told you they have seen him in Los Angeles in the last couple of 
months? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have any mutual friends of yours and Allen's told you anything 
about Allen's whereabouts the last couple of months? 
 
A: I spoke with [Name Deleted] from Phoenix.  They were over in 
Phoenix playing golf.  That was a few weeks ago. 
 
Q: Do you know where they were in Phoenix? 
 
A: At some hotel. 
 
Q: Was it the Phoenician? 
 
A: That could have been. 
 
Q: Okay. And you think that was within the last few weeks? 
 
A: [Name Deleted] had called me, and she needed to get some 
information and wanted me to help her, and I said okay, and I 
called her back and gave her the information. 
 
Q: Did you have any other discussions with her regarding her 
husband at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: All right.  Do you recall in 1992 when Nicole moved out of 
Rockingham? 
 
A: Oh, you still asking the question?    
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: In 1992? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: When she moved out of Rockingham? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: To where? 
 
Q: To Gretna Green. 
 
A: Yeah, I guess if that was the time when she moved out, yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And she and Simpson were going through a divorce 
during that time period also? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Could you tell me whether Simpson changed the people he 
started hanging around with after 1992 when he and Nicole were 
going through the divorce? 
 
A: I don't know.  You talking about friends of the two of them or -- 
I don't know. 
 
Q: He alone.  Do you know who he started spending time with 
during the divorce and right afterwards? 
 
A: O.J. was in and out of town a lot because of his --  
 
Q: New York? 
 
A: -- New York connection with NBC and his other commitments. 
 
Q: Would you see him when he came into town? 
 
A: We didn't see a lot of each other because O.J. is really -- was 
into golf at the time, so he was either on the golf course or out of 
town.  We would talk periodically, "Hey, man," if we did talk, you 
know, "When you get some free time, let's have dinner," or some 
thing like that. 
 
Q: You don't play golf at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. KELLY: This might be a good place to stop or go for a half 
hour, either way. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Sure, whatever. 
 
MR. KELLY: Anybody have an opinion on that? 
 
MR. BREWER: Let's stop here. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay.

EXAMINATION (Resumed) 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Good afternoon, Mr. Cowlings. 
 
A: Good afternoon. 
 
Q: I had been asking you earlier some questions about Lou, Judy 
and Denise Brown, and I just wanted to ask you a few more about 
the Brown family.  Do you recall when you first met Dominique 
Brown? 
 
A: It all had to be -- let me see.  No, I can't remember exactly when 
I met Dominique. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was it in the same time frame that you got to know the 
other Browns, Lou and Judy, 1979-1980 period?

that she was ever angry at Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was there any time after June 12th,1994 that Dominique 
indicated to you that she thought Mr. Simpson had murdered 
Nicole? 
 
A: I think one incident down at the Browns' house, she -- in her -- 
she said something to me, and it made me to believe that she 
believed O.J. is responsible. 
 
Q: Do you recall --  
 
A: But I can't tell you exactly how she worded it.  It wasn't like she 
asked me directly.  I was talking to someone else, and she said 
something. 
 
Q: Do you recall what she said? 
 
A: Not exactly what she said, but it led me to believe that she felt 
that O.J. is responsible. 
 
Q: Okay. How long ago was this? 
 
A: This was quite a while ago. 
 
Q: Was this during the course of the trial? 
 
A: Not that I remember.    
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: It would have had to be one of the weekends or one of the days 
I came down to see the kids or do something with the kids. 
 
Q: Okay.  And with regard to [Name Deleted], you know her also? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You got to know her in that same time frame we've been 
discussing?

reason? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Has there been any time since June 12th, 1994 where she 
indicated to you she thought Mr. Simpson murdered Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Could you tell me when you first met Nicole? 
 
A: Whatever year O.J. and her met, I probably met her -- I think I 
went to -- no.  I think I met Nicole at [Name Deleted]'s with O.J. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know what year that was? 
 
A: Whatever year they met. 
 
Q: Okay.  Had -- when you met her at [Name Deleted]'s, had she 
and Simpson already started dating? 
 
A: I assume so, yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you know where she was living at that time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you know where she was working at that time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever see her in The Daisy? 
 
A: O.J. told me that's where he met her: At The Daisy. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you ever go there with Simpson? 
 
A: I would go there myself. 
 
Q: Okay.  Had you ever seen Nicole in there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you remember seeing people like [Name Deleted] in The 
Daisy? 
 
A: At night -- excuse me.  You said at The Daisy? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Yeah, The Daisy was a popular night spot. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: And I would frequent The Daisy at night. 
 
Q: Okay.  All right.  Do you know how old Nicole was when you 
first met her? 
 
A: I think O.J. told me she was 18. 
 
Q: What type of person was Nicole then? 
 
A: Quiet, nice, quiet.  Didn't say too much. 
 
Q: Did you enjoy talking to her, though? 
 
A: You couldn't talk to Nicole.  She didn't talk that much. 
 
Q: You didn't talk to her at all? 
 
A: She wasn't a woman with a lot of words.  She was somewhat 
shy.  I would say she was shy a lot at that time. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did she open up later on in life in terms of --  
 
A: After you spent time with her, you know.  I mean, it wasn't like 
she was distant or anything.  She was just a shy person.  And we 
probably got better acquainted when we were down in the 
Caribbean because her and I, we spent a lot of time together when 
O.J. was filming.  We were down there for quite a long time. 
 
Q: When was the first time you went down there with her? 
 
A: Pardon? 
 
Q: When was the first time yon were down in the- 
 
A: The Caribbean? 
 
Q: -- Caribbean? 
 
A: In '78, the year '78.  I was still playing with the Rams, and O.J. 
was working on a film there. 
 
Q: Do you know what film he was working on at that time? 
 
A: FIREPOWER. 
 
Q: Okay.  And after she opened up a little bit, did you enjoy 
talking to Nicole then? 
 
A: Yeah. She was a pleasant person. She was always very, very 
pleasant. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did she seem to be interested in your life also? 
 
A We were friends.  I mean, she didn't ask me, you know, what I 
was doing, but we were just friends.  It was just an average 
relationship at the time. 
 
Q: Okay. Did she like to laugh? 
 
A: Yeah. She was -- O.J.'s a -- has a great sense of humor, and, you 
know, we've had some good laughs. 
 
Q: Did she like to dance? 
 
A: Yeah. 
   
Q: Was she athletic? 
 
A: Very. 
 
Q: Okay.  What sports did you see her playing? 
 
A: Tennis.  I would help her with her tennis game.  Nicole was a 
doer.  Whatever Nicole put her mind to, she could do, and I always 
admired that about her. 
 
Q: Okay.  By the way, did you ever see her riding bikes? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Down in the Caribbean? 
 
A: I don't remember if she rode a bike down in the Caribbean. 
 
Q: Do you know if she had a bike up in Rockingham? 
 
A: Yeah, all of -- yeah, there was bikes there. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you ever see her riding one? 
 
A: I think so.  And she had a baby seat on hers.  I guess her and 
O.J. had bikes.  I mean, they had bikes together. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did there come a time that Nicole moved to San 
Francisco? 
 
A: Her and O.J. was inseparable a lot of -- every time I -- most of 
the time I saw O.J., he was with Nicole. They traveled --  
 
Q: Well -- I'm sorry. 
 
A: They traveled a lot together, and when he ended up with the 
49ers, she moved with him. 
 
Q: Okay.  And she was living with him up there? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did she have her own place up there? 
 
A: No.  O.J. had a condo, and she lived with O.J. 
 
Q: Okay. How long did they live up in San Francisco at the condo? 
 
A: During the season for the two years he was there, they lived 
there in San Francisco together. 
 
a: Do you know where Simpson would live in the off-season then? 
 
A: Back in Los Angeles on Rockingham. 
 
Q: He --  
 
A: No, no.  Back on Rockingham, but they -- she had an apartment 
here. 
 
Q: Nicole did? 
 
A: Matter of fact, they maintained -- think she maintained her 
apartment here in Los Angeles. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you know if Simpson ever rented a place during that 
time period before he moved into Rockingham down in LA.? 
 
A: For hisself?  
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Not that I know of. 
 
Q: Okay. So as far as you know, he would either stay in Nicole's 
place or at Rockingham? 
 
A: As far as I know. 
 
Q: Okay.  Would you go out with them socially at all when they 
were up in San Francisco? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay.  See them regularly?    
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Were you dating anybody at that time? 
 
A: When I was playing -- you talking about the period when I was 
in San Francisco playing for the 49ers? 
 
Q: The period when Nicole and O.J. were living up in San 
Francisco. 
 
A: Yes, I was dating a young lady.    
 
Q: And what was her name? 
 
A: I don't know.  Slips my mind. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What years are we talking about? 
 
THE WITNESS: It would be '79. No. '6 -- no, '79.  When did I 
retire?  '79.  Yeah, '79. 
 
MR. RE: Time flies. 
 
THE WITNESS: You telling me. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: You can't think of the first name of that lucky young lady you 
were dating back then, Mr. Cowlings? 
 
A: I don't know how lucky she was, but my memory slips on that 
one.  
 
Q: How long did you date her for? 
 
A: Quite a while.  I was heartbroken.    
 
Q: More than a year? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And you can't remember her name? 
 
A: No. It's tough times. 
 
Q: Any old love letters you might have or something --  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- that might refresh your recollection? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Telephone directories? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Just draw a blank on that name? 
 
A: It'll probably come to me.  I'll pass it on to Donald when I --  
 
Q: I might ask you again later.   
 
A: Okay.  
 
Q: Okay?  
 
A: All right.  
 
Q: You let me know any time during this questioning, though, if 
you think of it.  Okay? 
 
A: Okay. 
 
MR. RE: You're going to make him rake over these old sorry 
loves, huh?    
 
MR. KELLY: Very reluctant about that one. 
 
Q: When Nicole was living with Simpson up in San Francisco at 
the condominium, do you remember any argument between them 
that you witnessed? 
 
A: There was one argument I remember. 
 
Q: And what was that? 
 
A: I don't know.  It was something -- she was messing with him or 
doing something.  I don't know.  They were in the bedroom.  I was 
in the front room watching TV. 
 
Q: And what did you hear? 
 
A: I didn't hear.  Nicole came out. 
 
Q: And what did she say? 
 
A: She was just sitting there, and I could tell that she was upset 
about something.  She just had a, you know, look on her face. 
 
Q: She didn't say anything to you? 
 
A: No.  She just said -- I said, "What's wrong?"  And she just was 
tightlipped and just shook her head. 
 
Q: Did you ever talk to her again after that about what had 
happened that day? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever talk to Simpson after that about what had 
happened that day? 
 
A: Well, I heard some commotion in the bedroom. 
 
Q: When you say a "commotion," was it voices you heard? 
 
A: No. No.  When her and I were up front, and this is a while -- I 
don't know -- a few minutes had went by, and I see that she didn't 
want to, you know, talk, so she sat there with me watching TV.  
Then I heard some commotion in the -- towards the bedroom in the 
condo. 
 
Q: When she was up watching TV with you --  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: -- you heard a commotion? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: You don't know what the commotion was? 
 
A: Oh, yeah, I know because I went back to investigate it. 
 
Q: And what was it? 
 
A: O.J. was -- I heard some -- when I opened the door, he had just 
closed the bathroom door.  Then I opened the bathroom door, and 
the window was up, and then I looked out and her clothes were 
three stories down, laying over her car. 
 
Q: Okay.  He had chucked her clothes out the window? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you say anything to him at that point? 
 
A: I asked him what was he doing. 
 
Q: And what did he tell you he was doing? 
 
A: He said, "None of your business." 
 
Q: What else did you say to him after that? 
 
A: I said he was crazy.   
 
Q: Did he look crazy at that time?    
 
A: No. I just said, "You crazy," and I went downstairs and picked 
everything up and brought it back up. 
 
Q: Okay.  How did he -- could you describe his appearance to me 
when you walked in the bathroom? 
 
A: Seemed like he was upset, too. 
 
Q: Well, how did he physically appear to you? 
 
A: Mad, somewhat.  To what level, I have no idea because I was 
just --  when I realized what he had done when I looked out and 
saw her belongings over -- laying on top of her car, I went 
downstairs and got them. 
 
Q: Were the clothes anywhere other than on top of the car? 
 
A: I mean, they had fallen on the side. 
 
Q: Did you see where he had gotten the clothing from? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you say anything to him other than, "You're crazy?" 
 
A: I just said, "You're crazy"; just you know, went downstairs. 
 
Q: Did Nicole go downstairs with you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know whether it was all the clothing she had in the 
apartment? 
 
A: I have -- no, I don't know if it was everything she had. 
 
Q: What did you mean when you told Mr. Simpson he was crazy? 
 
A: I said he's crazy for throwing her clothes out.  I mean, "You're 
crazy." 
 
Q: You think that was a little unusual? 
 
A: It's very unusual. 
 
Q: You ever in all your experiences ever seen a friend of yours 
chuck clothes out the window before? 
 
A: I've seen some friends go off on their spouses or arguments.  
You know, guys do -- you've been in --  well. 
 
MR. RE: He's from the Midwest. 
 
THE WITNESS: He's from the Midwest.  He's been married all his 
life, married his high school sweetheart.  No, but it was an unusual 
situation.  I've never seen him and Nicole in that frame before. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  And how long had they been dating at that point? 
 
A: They had been dating a while.  It had been over a year, a year 
and a half or so. 
 
Q: Had you heard anything Simpson said prior to you walking in 
the bathroom? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And Nicole had not said anything to you when she walked -- 
   
A: No. 
 
Q: -- out of the bedroom?  
 
A: Uh-uh.  She was tight-lipped and just shook her head when I 
asked her what was wrong. 
 
Q: Did you see any bruises on her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Any signs whatsoever of a physical altercation with Simpson --  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- when she walked out of here? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. How long did it take you to gather the clothes outside? 
 
A: It took me a while.  You know, clothes, I had to pick them up 
and try to put them in a manner so I could carry them, you know, 
back up. 
 
Q: Do you recall whether there was like underwear out there? 
 
A: I don't know.  It was just clothes.  Could have been. 
 
Q: I mean, it wasn't just like one outfit, was it? 
 
A: No, it wasn't one outfit, no. 
 
Q: Okay.  And when you brought them upstairs, you brought them 
back up three flights yourself? 
 
A: Yeah, I brought them back.  It's a long   flight of stairs. 
 
Q: When you were outside, did you see anybody else outside 
there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know what time of day this was at? 
 
A: It was at night.    
 
Q: How late? 
 
A: I don't know.  If I was still -- could have been -- probably had to 
be 8:30, 9:00 o'clock, 10:00 o'clock range, because I didn't stay up 
that late because I had practice the next day. 
 
Q: Do you know where -- Had you been out earlier that evening 
with Nicole and Simpson? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Do you remember anything you had done that day prior to this? 
 
A: Practice. 
 
Q: Other than that, had you been out to dinner with them? 
 
A: I can't remember if we had dinner or if I ate out somewhere by 
myself or if what they -- eat at home or whatever. 
 
Q: Do you know whether Simpson had been drinking at all? 
 
A: I doubt it. 
 
Q: Do you know whether he had been drinking at all? 
 
A: I don't know if -- no, I don't know if he had a drink, but I -- it 
didn't appear to me that he had been drinking. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you know whether he had done any drugs or not? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You don't know? 
 
A: It appeared to me that he hadn't done any drugs. 
 
Q: Okay.  What did you do with the clothes after you brought them 
back upstairs? 
 
A: I brought them back upstairs, folded  them, tried to put them 
neatly back in the living room.  When I got back, the two of them 
were in the bedroom together. 
 
Q: Were they talking? 
 
A: I don't know.  I didn't ask.  The door was closed. 
 
Q: Did you see them again that night? 
 
A: No. I went to bed.    
 
Q: At their place? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And you left the clothes in the living room? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Just one minute here. 
 
MR.RE: And I thought we were making such progress. 
 
MR. KELLY: Just looking for something. It's all right. 
 
Q: After that night, did you ever discuss this incident again with 
Mr. Simpson?  
 
A: I think maybe at practice I may have mentioned something. 
 
Q: Do you recall what you said to him? 
 
A: "Man, you know, what was all that about?" 
 
Q: What did he tell you?    
 
A: Nothing. 
 
Q: He never told you why he chucked all her clothes out the 
window? 
 
A: No.  It's all forgotten, I guess. 
 
Q: Did you ever talk to Nicole again after that? 
 
A: No, uh-uh. 
 
MR. RE: You mean about that.    
 
MR. KELLY: About that. 
 
THE WITNESS: No, uh-uh.  I just left it alone. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: In what year did Mr. Simpson retire?  Do you recall? 
 
A: '79, 1979. 
 
Q: And did he move back to Los Angeles after that? 
 
A: I stayed in San Francisco for another six months.  I was 
working -- I was going through a mining program with Levi 
Strauss, so I stayed at their condo the whole time I was there. 
 
Q: At Simpson's condo --  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: -- after he moved out? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Okay.  And was Nicole still living in her Westwood place at 
that time? 
 
A: I don't know. Like I said, I stayed; I didn't come back.  When 
the season was over, I was accepted to try -- to start the training 
program with Levi Strauss, so I was up there for six months. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you know whether Marquerite was still living in 
Rockingham at this point? 
 
A: I really don't know. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: I was traveling.  They had me going into Oregon and Seattle 
and stuff, so I didn't know what was going on down in L A. that 
much. 
 
Q: Okay. So you didn't spend much time with Nicole end Simpson 
before they --  
 
A: After --  
 
Q: -- before they moved into Rockingham and after the '79 season? 
 
A: No, they hadn't moved back into Rockingham, because I 
remember O.J. -- they must -- okay.  O.J. had rented a house up on 
Stone Canyon.  That's what -- yes.  They didn't move into -- they 
moved into a house in Stone Canyon. 
 
Q: And this was after the '79 season? 
 
A: Yeah.  When I came back down to L A., that's where he was 
living. 
 
Q: Okay.  So at the end of the '79 season, Marquerite was still in 
Rockingham? 
 
A: As far as I know.  You know, like I said, I was in San 
Francisco, and when I came down -- came back to Los Angeles, 
moved back to Los Angeles, O.J. and Nicole were living at -- 
rented a house up in Stone Canyon. 
 
Q: Okay.  And Marquerite, as far as you know, was still in 
Rockingham? 
 
A: If that's where she was staying, yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  After Simpson -- Do you know when Marquerite moved 
out of Rockingham, by the way? 
 
A: Whenever her period was up for her to be in the house. 
 
Q: What was your understanding of when her period was up? 
 
A: I don't know.  I know she -- that's why he couldn't move into the 
house right away, because she -- whatever stipulations they had in 
their agreement, she was to stay in the house. 
 
Q: Was it your understanding that once their divorce was final, she 
had to move out of Rockingham? 
 
A: I don't know the particulars of it.  All I know, she had the house 
up until a certain part of time. 
 
Q: And then she permanently moved out. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And she had to leave with the two children. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. And he moved in by himself. 
 
A: Or Nicole moved in with him. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you spend much time there after they -- Nicole and 
Simpson moved into Rockingham? 
 
A: Yeah, I occasionally would be by there. 
 
Q: Were you there in this period I am talking about, between 1980 
when they moved into Rockingham --  
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: -- and 1985 when they finally got married?  Did you spend 
much time there at Rockingham? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you -- were there times during this '80 to '85 period 
you discussed with Simpson his intentions of marrying Nicole? 
 
A: I didn't discuss them. If O.J. volunteered to say, "I'm going to 
marry this girl one day," you know, I didn't -- I was -- whatever O.J. 
was -- you know, they were going together, you know... 
 
Q: Well, did you ever discuss the relationship he had with Nicole, 
with Simpson? 
 
THE WITNESS: No, uh-uh.  I just left it alone. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: In what year did Mr. Simpson retire? Do you recall? 
 
A: '79,1979. 
 
Q: And did he move back to Los Angeles after that? 
   
A: Yes. 
 
Q: After the season in '79, do you recall where he moved back to? 
 
A: It didn't need to be discussed. I knew  both of them loved each 
other. 
 
Q: But he never talked to you separately about Nicole? 
 
A: Yeah, that he loved her. 
 
Q: And that's all you ever talked to him about? 
 
A: Basically that's -- you know, how wonderful she was, she was 
his best buddy and, you know, he was very grateful to have her in 
his life, and she was everything to him, she -- her whole world was 
O.J., and they got along great together. 
 
Q: Through this whole time period, '80 to '85? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay.  Never saw any arguments there? 
 
A: I wouldn't say arguments.  I would probably say disappointment 
on Nicole's part. 
   
Q: Because she wanted to get married? 
 
A: No.  I guess because O.J.'s womanizing. 
   
Q: During this 1980 to '85 time period? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: He was still dating other women? 
 
A: Yeah, I guess. He was, you know, being -- I know one incident 
she saw him, and I thought -- she supposedly, I guess, drove up on 
him and he was standing on a corner I guess talking to a girl, and 
Nicole got very upset about it. 
 
Q: What did she do? 
 
A: I think she threw a picture frame at him or something like that. 
 
Q: And this was before they were married? 
 
A: Probably, yes. 
 
Q: And did Simpson tell you about this incident? 
 
A: No. Nicole did. 
 
Q: Did she tell you why she threw a picture frame at him? 
 
A: I guess she thought he was flirting with this -- with a girl, with 
this girl.  
 
Q: And Nicole didn't like that? 
 
A: No. Would you? 
 
Q: I don't know.  I'm asking you.   
 
A: No, uh-uh. 
 
Q: Do you know who, if anybody, Nicole -- I mean Simpson was 
dating during this period besides Nicole? 
 
A: Uh-uh. No.  I'm sorry.  No. 
 
Q: Did you ever see him with any other women, other than Nicole, 
during this time period? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: When you say "seeing," like on a regular basis, the same 
person? 
 
Q: No. Out on a date. Did you ever see Simpson on a date with 
someone other than Nicole? 
 
A: No, I wouldn't see him on a date.  He may flirt with a girl, say, 
"Hey know, you look nice," or something like that, if I was in his 
company, but it wasn't like, "A.C., come with me. I got this date" 
or "I'm going to see this other girl," no. 
 
Q: That never happened. 
 
A: I wouldn't be around it. 
 
Q: Why is that? 
 
A: Because I like Nicole. 
 
Q: And Simpson knew you'd never tolerate it, also? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Well, if I wasn't around there, I couldn't say 
anything. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  In this period between 1980 and 1985 before they got 
married, do you know of any time that Nicole and Simpson broke 
up? 
 
A: Yeah.  Yeah. 
 
Q: More than once? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Could you tell me the first time this was? 
 
A: I don't know the first time.  It became a -- somewhat of a joke.  
I'm not trying to make it out as a funny situation, but I was the one 
always called either by O.J. or Nicole to help her move her stuff, so 
--  
 
Q: Did you use a Hertz man, by the way? 
 
A: No. No.  I told them, if they kept that up, I was going to go into 
the moving van business.  So she would go back home to Laguna. 
 
Q: Let me ask you specifically, when was the first time, if you can 
recall, that they broke up after 1980 when they moved into 
Rockingham, 
 
A: The only one that stands out in my mind was that particular day 
of when she drove up on O.J., because I was at the house playing 
tennis --  
 
Q: With whom? 
 
A: I forgot who I was playing with -- and Nicole pulled up and -- 
no.  The phone had rang. He had an outside phone.  The phone had 
rang. I went over and picked it up, and it was O.J., and he said, "Is 
Nicole there?" 
 
Just as I said -- I went to go say "no," Nicole pulled up in her car, 
and I said, "Yes, she just pulled up." 
 
And he said, "Ah, man," he said, "Ah, A.C., man, she thinks I was 
flirting with this girl, and it's not so." 
 
I'm saying -- I'm like -- I mean, because all of this was new to me.  I 
don't know. 
 
So he said, "Let me speak to Nicole."  And I said, "Nicole, you 
want to speak to O.J.?" 
 
She says-can I use the word? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Please. 
 
THE WITNESS: "F**k O.J.," you know, such and such, "I'm outta 
here." 
 
And that was the most memorable -- mean, that's the one that 
stands out in my mind. 
 
BY MR. KELLY:   
 
Q: Okay. Let me ask you a couple of questions.  First of all, when 
you say O.J. had an "outside phone" --  
 
A: Out by the tennis court. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was there a cabana there for the pool and tennis court? 
 
A: Yeah, uh-huh. 
 
Q: Okay. And was that part of the phone system? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Other than the cabana, were there other places outside 
that he had phone jacks that you can recall? 
 
MR. LEONARD: During this time period? 
 
MR. KELLY: During this time period. 
 
THE WITNESS: Not that I know of, except the phone on the front 
gate, but that phone don't -- only work to buzz to let somebody 
know that's somebody outside. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  You don't know of any phone outlets out on the terraces 
that he had? 
   
A: No, I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay.  And how far would the cabana be from the main house? 
 
A: It's in between the tennis court and the main house.  Exact1y 
how far, I don't know. 
 
Q: Okay.  And do you recall what type of car Nicole drove in on 
that day when she came in the driveway? 
 
A: She may have had her Mercedes then.  He had bought her a 
Mercedes.  
 
Q: And what color was that? 
 
A: A white. 
 
Q: Okay. Was that a little one?    
 
A: Yeah, a little one. 
 
Q: Convertible? 
 
A: Convertible, yes.  
 
Q: Like a 450?  Do you recall?    
 
A: The sports model.  If that's the number on it yes. 
 
Q: The two-seater? 
 
A: Yeah, two-seater. 
 
Q: Okay.  And do you recall what color the top was on that? 
 
A: Tan. Sandy, tan, brown. 
 
Q: Okay. And after she made that statement of "F**k O.J.," did she 
actually knock the phone out of your hands? 
 
A: No, no, no, no, no. When I -- she wasn't by -- she had just pulled 
up in the driveway. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: And when O.J. said, "Let me speak to her," I said, "Nicole, O.J. 
want to speak to you."  From there she said, "F**k O.J." 
 
Q: So you yelled from the cabana over to the driveway? 
 
A: I said, "Nicole, O.J. wants to speak to you." 
 
Q: Uh-huh.  After she said that, what happened next? 
 
A: I said, "O.J., she don't want to talk to you." 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you talk to Nicole after that? 
 
A: She got her stuff and went to Laguna. 
 
Q: Were you there while she was packing? 
 
A: She didn't pack a lot of stuff.  She just, you know, took her 
stuff, and she says, "I'm through with it," you know, and she went 
to Laguna. 
 
Q: Did you help her pack? 
 
A: I think I did, yeah, because she took a lot of her stuff and -- 
because I remember later on in the week O.J. was -- I mean, 
because Nicole was so -- did everything there --  
 
Q: What do you mean, she "did everything"? 
 
A: I mean, she cooked; you know, the kitchen was arranged how 
she wanted it to be, and he couldn't find anything, and he couldn't 
even find a can opener to open up a can of soup. 
 
Q: Wasn't much of a cook? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  What was -- do you recall any specific conversation you 
had with Nicole before she was leaving for Laguna? 
 
A: I think -- I guess she expressed that she was tired of O.J. fooling 
around with girls, I guess. 
 
Q: That's --  
 
A: I don't know exactly, but I know that was a topic.  I mean, that's 
what was her problem at that time with him. 
 
Q: Do you recall what year that was? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you recall approximately how long they had been living at 
Rockingham when this incident took place? 
 
A: I could say they'd been living there for a while. 
 
Q: Over a year? 
 
A: Yeah, I would think so. 
 
Q: Okay.  And when Simpson came home, did you discuss the 
incident with him? 
 
A: I think I had left by that time. 
 
Q: Did you -- was there a time after that that you discussed --  
 
A: I'd go by and check on him, see if he had starved to death or 
something like that.  You know, he was -- so at that time I think he 
was trying to talk Nicole back. 
 
Q: Did he tell you anything more about the incident that occurred 
that day? 
 
A: From what he told me, it wasn't the way it looked, the way 
Nicole said.  I wasn't there, so I don't know exactly what went 
down. 
 
Q: Did you repeat to him the conversation you had with Nicole 
about she'd had it with him and his womanizing? 
 
A: Yeah, I think so.  I probably did say something to him about it. 
 
Q: Do you recall what his response was to that? 
 
A: I have no idea.  I can't remember. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall Simpson discussing with you his decision 
to finally marry Nicole? 
 
A: Probably, because he asked me, you know, to stand up for him. 
 
Q: You were his best man? 
 
A: Yeah, Jason and I. 
 
Q: Okay.  Going back to this one incident where Nicole grabbed 
her clothes and went down to Laguna, where did she go down to 
Laguna? 
 
A: I guess to her parents. 
 
Q: Okay.  That was your understanding of where she was going? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know exactly.  I just assumed that's where 
she was going.  Where she went exactly, I don't know.  I just 
assumed that's where she went. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you know when she moved back to Rockingham 
after that? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Do you know when the next time you saw her was? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Was it at Rockingham? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Did you talk to her any time in between the time she had left 
that day and when she was back at Rockingham? 
 
A: I think I met with her one time.  She had called me, and we met 
down -- at that time it wasn't Mezaluna.  It was Georges VII Pietro? 
 
MR. RE: Yes. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, that's when he had it.  And we met, and she 
was missing O.J., and--  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: How long had she been out of Rockingham for? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: More than a week? 
 
A: Could have been.  Could have been more.  Could have been 
less. I don't know exactly. 
 
Q: I'm sorry to interrupt you.  You were --  
 
A: I'm used to you. 
 
Q: -- talking about the meeting. 
 
A: We met, and she missed him, and I was encouraging her to say 
-- you know, I say, "Hey, if he's that sorry, have him come down to 
Laguna to get you." You know, "Wait till he comes down here to 
apologize to you." 
 
Q: Did she indicate that he had been calling her? 
 
A: I guess. I assumed they had been talking. 
 
Q: And did she tell you what he had said to her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  What else did she say to you at that meeting? 
 
A: By that time O.J. pulled up. 
 
Q: I am sorry.  Where were you talking to her again? 
 
A: At the restaurant. 
 
Q: And where was this restaurant?  
 
A: Where Mezzaluna is now. 
 
Q: In Brentwood. 
 
A: In Brentwood, yes. 
 
Q: In Brentwood? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: And who had decided on that place to meet at? 
 
A: I think we both did.  She wanted me to get her something.  
There was something at the house she wanted, and so I went and 
got it for her. 
   
Q: Okay.  And she had driven up from Laguna? 
 
A: I don't know if -- she met me there.  Where she came from, I 
don't know. 
 
Q: Okay.  All right.  And were you having lunch there or dinner 
or... 
 
A: No. We met there, and I guess maybe I was eating something or 
maybe having a drink or a Coke or something like that. 
 
Q: And you were sitting inside. 
 
A: Yes, we were sitting inside facing San Vicente. 
 
Q: Okay.  And how long were you there with her for?  
 
A: 5 minutes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And other than her saying she wanted to get back 
together with O.J., what else did she tell you? 
 
A: Well, no, she didn't say she wanted to get back.  She was just 
saying how much she missed him. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: You know, and they had talked on the phone.  I don't know how 
many times they talked, but they had been talking. 
 
And so I say, "Well, stay strong." You know, "Wait till he comes 
down there and apologizes." 
 
Then before we knew it, I looked up and there he was in his car.  
He pulled up.  So she -- 
 
Q: Did -- go on. I'm sorry. 
 
A: No. Go ahead. You go ahead. 
 
Q: No. I want you to go first, Mr. Cowlings. 
 
A: No.  You go ahead. 
 
Q: He pulled up in the car and? 
 
A: Nicole looked at me.  I looked at Nicole.  She smiled.  And then 
he kind of like -- I guess he asked her to come there, and she did. 
 
Q: Do you know whether she had driven up to the restaurant that 
day? 
 
A: I don't know for sure. 
 
Q: Did you ever see her car outside the restaurant? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever tell Simpson you were meeting her that day? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she indicate to you that she had told Simpson she was 
meeting you there that day? 
 
A: No.  I was led to believe that O.J. didn't know she was up there, 
because she had asked me to get -- I forgot what it was she wanted 
me to get from the house, but I got it for her, so it was obviously 
she didn't want O.J. to know. 
 
Q: Okay.  How long prior to meeting her at the restaurant had you 
been at Rockingham? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did you go straight from Rockingham to the restaurant? 
 
A: Oh, you -- oh, yes.  I went by to get what she wanted and went 
to meet her. 
 
Q: Was Simpson at the house when you went by there? 
 
A: No, I don't think so.  I don't think he was there. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was Michelle there? 
 
A: I don't know if Michelle was the maid at that time.  No, it 
wasn't.  I think Michelle came later on. It was some other maid. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was anybody else there when you went by there before 
meeting Nicole? 
 
A: I can't remember if anybody else was there. 
 
Q: Did Simpson indicate to you how he knew you two -- that the 
two of you were in that restaurant? 
 
A: To this day I don't know how he knew that. 
   
Q: Where was your car parked? 
 
A: I guess on the street where I parked it. 
 
Q: Okay. And he had already parked and was coming in when you 
saw him? 
 
A: Pardon? 
 
Q: Had Simpson already parked his car --  
 
A: No, no, no, no, no. O.J. pulled up in his car, and we were sitting 
on the San Vicente side, and we looked up and there he was.  He 
was still sitting inside his car, double -- I guess either the red zone 
or he had pulled up double to the car that was parked to the curb. 
 
Q: And you never told him you were going there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Now, after that did Nicole move back into Rockingham? 
 
A: They left together. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did they spend any time in there talking with you there? 
 
A: No.  She got in the car, and they went on about their business. 
 
Q: After this incident you said there were a number of occasions 
that Nicole left O.J. during this time period, '80 to '85? 
 
A: It was occasions that, you know, because of his womanizing, 
that she would get upset and go home. 
 
Q: All right.  Can you tell me another specific incident when you 
were there and this happened? 
 
A: I don't remember exactly.  Like I said, that one incident stood 
out in my mind, but --  
 
MR. KELLY: I am sorry.  Are we picking up sound all right from 
Mr. Cowlings? 
 
THE WITNESS: No. Sometimes I cross my arms. 
 
MR.KELLY: Because the mike is down low, too; that's why. 
 
It's fine?  Okay.  I'm sorry. Could you read the last question, 
please. 
 
(Pending question read as follows: 
 
"Q. All right. Can you tell me another specific incident when you 
were there and this happened?") 
 
THE WITNESS: What happened? 
 
BY MR KELLY: 
 
Q: Nicole and Simpson had a fight. 
 
A: Oh, I never saw a fight. 
 
Q: Argument. 
   
A: Arguments? 
 
Q: Well, strike that.  I had asked you and you had indicated there 
were other times that Nicole left because of Simpson's 
womanizing? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Okay.  Could you tell me the other specific times this 
happened? 
 
A: The only one I said that stands out in my mind is that incident 
that happened at that particular day. 
 
Q: Do you remember any other time where Nicole actually packed 
her clothes and left there? 
 
A: I can't give you a definite answer on that. It's just that one stood 
out in my mind. There was other times that her -- she would move 
-- go to Laguna.  You know, she, you know... 
 
Q: Did you talk to her about any of those incidences? 
 
A: No I would just tease her about me moving her. 
 
Q: So there was more than one time you helped her move out of 
Rockingham. 
 
A: I helped her move out of her apartment --  
 
Q: In Westwood? 
 
A: -- in Beverly Hills. No. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: Because I moved a lot of her stuff to O.J.'s house.  So I helped 
her, you know, whenever she needed help. 
 
Q: Okay. But there were other occasions, other than this one, 
before they got married when Nicole moved out of Rockingham, 
were there not? 
 
MR LEONARD: Objection.  Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Like I say, it happened. She had -- I don't know 
about moving.  Maybe she had left the house and went to Laguna. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Were you there any of the times she actually left Rockingham? 
 
A: The only one that stands out in my mind is that one I told you 
about. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you have any recollection of conversations you had 
with Nicole on other occasions when she had left the house? 
 
A: I wouldn't talk to her from -- if she had left to go to Laguna, I 
wouldn't be talking to her, no. 
 
Q: You never called her down at her parents' house --  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- down there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall how many times you helped her move out 
of Rockingham --   
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- before they got married? 
 
A: Uh-uh. 
 
Q: Do you recall how many times she herself left Rockingham 
before they got married? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Would it be more than two times? 
 
A: I have no knowledge of it. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: You indicated before there was more than one occasion when 
she left. 
 
A: Yeah, I couldn't -- like I said, I can't give you a direct number on 
how many times it happened.  It could have happened once.  It 
could have happened twice. It could have happened three times.  I 
don't know. 
 
Q: Well, we know it happened once.  Correct? 
 
A: We know that. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: And that's the only one that stands out in my mind. 
 
Q: But you indicated there had been other times that you knew of 
she left the house, did you not? 
 
A: I knew I had helped her move.  Now, it could have been the 
time I helped her move her stuff from Beverly Hills to 
Rockingham.  I can't pinpoint -- you see, I know -- if I -- I wish I 
could give you a direct answer, but I don't know it. 
 
Q: I am asking you very specifically, after Nicole had moved into 
Rockingham, how many times she left Rockingham and went 
elsewhere? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: You know of the one specific time she left Rockingham and 
went elsewhere. Correct.? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you know of any other time she left Rockingham and went 
elsewhere? 
 
A: I know of her going.  I don't know how many times she has 
gone. 
 
Q: Okay. Was it more than twice? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: I can't give you that answer.  I don't know, sir. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Well, you indicated earlier that you and Nicole would sort of 
joke about your moving Nicole, did you not? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: So there were enough occasions where she moved out of 
Rockingham where it was at least a topic of conversation between 
the two of you. 
 
A: I had --  
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. Go ahead. 
 
MR. KELLY: I am sorry. Could you read the question back? 
 
(Pending question read.) 
 
THE WITNESS: It was more of a standard joke with Nicole and I. 
   
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: And that was the joke about her leaving Simpson? 
   
A: Or packing up, yes. 
 
Q: To --  
 
A: I can't tell you how many times that -- because I don't know. 
 
Q: Okay. But it was a standard joke between you and Nicole -- 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: -- about her pecking up to leave Simpson. 
 
A: Packing up to leave, yeah, Rockingham. 
 
Q: Okay.  Where Simpson was living. 
   
A: Where the two of them were living. 
 
Q: Okay. You indicated you were best man at their wedding? 
 
A: Yes, Jason and I, his son Jason. We both stood up. 
 
Q: Were there any ushers in addition to you and Jason there? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And who were they?  Do you recall? 
 
A: Marcus Allen, [Name Deleted], Ahmad Rashad, Skip Taft, I 
think.  I don't know if his brother was down here, Truman.  I don't 
know.  It could have been...Those are the ones that come to mind. 
 
Q: Okay.  And after they were married did you spend a lot of time 
at Rockingham still with O.J. and Nicole? 
 
A: They went on their honeymoon. 
 
Q: After they got back from their honeymoon and for the next 
several years, would you be at Rockingham? 
 
A: I would come by, yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  By the way, did you discuss with Nicole her getting 
married to O.J. after O.J. proposed to her? 
 
A: I don't know.  I don't recall any conversation.  I mean, they were 
getting married. 
 
Q: You never discussed this with Nicole separately, about her 
getting married to Simpson? 
 
A: Discuss what? 
 
Q: The fact that she was getting married to Simpson finally. 
 
A: They made the announcement.  I assumed that they were getting 
married.  There was no need to discuss it -- discuss to her about 
their marriage. 
 
Q: Prior to that announcement did Nicole ever express frustration 
to you that she and Simpson were not married yet? 
 
A: Not to me. 
 
Q: She never indicated to you she wished she was married to 
Simpson? 
 
A: Not to me. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was there any time prior to the wedding that Simpson 
indicated to you his frustration that Nicole wouldn't marry him?' 
   
A: Not to me. 
 
Q: You never got any indication from either one of them that they 
had wanted to get married prior to the time they did? 
 
A: No, not to my knowledge.  I mean, they went together for eight 
years.  They lived there together.  You know, they were happy, 
so... 
 
Q: Did you ever live at Rockingham.' 
 
A: I would stay there on periods.  Like I said, early on, when the 
house was under construction, they were back East, so I oversaw 
the grounds. 
 
Q: Okay. Where did you stay when you were there at Rockingham 
 
A: In the guesthouse. 
 
Q: There are two guest rooms, are there not? 
 
A: At that time it was just the one. 
 
Q: Do you know when the second guest room was put on the 
house? 
 
A: When they -- I think when he had all the work done to the 
house.  I think the other guesthouses -- I mean the two bedrooms 
were added on.  They could have been there before.  I don't know. 
 
Q: The guest room you stayed in, is it your understanding that's the 
same guest room that Kato Kaelin was staying in in June of 1994? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  When you were staying there, you never heard any 
thumps on the wall out back, did you? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you ever go back behind that room? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when was that? 
 
MR. RE: If we're talking about --  
 
THE WITNESS: A number of times. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
 Q: Okay.  Could you tell me the last time you were out behind that 
room? 
 
MR. RE: Again, we are excluding the period --  
 
THE WITNESS: Okay. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Well, let's be more specific.  Do you recall the last time before 
June 12th,1994 that you were out behind that guesthouse? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever chase the kids back here at all in playing with 
them? 
 
A: No.  When I would -- when Nicole and O.J. would go out of 
town, I would -- and they would ask me to look after the animals, 
the cats and the dogs, and I would -- Cheba, the biggest dog, had a 
rash on its neck, and I had to keep him separate from the other dog.  
So I would take him back there, and there was a little fence that I 
could keep him from getting with the other dogs to give the wound 
a chance to heal. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was that up at the laundry room there? 
 
A: No.  It's along -- it's -- you could -- I guess the gate is still there.  
I guess it's about three or four feet high.  And I just,  you know, 
closed him back there.  So he had the full run along that back way 
to the back. 
 
Q: And was that gate next to the garage there and driveway? 
 
A: No.  It was more close to the -- I would think, if my memory 
doesn't slip me, I think its closer to the laundry door.  It could be, 
yeah. 
 
Q: Okay.  And what was at the far end of that runway, then, to 
keep the dog from getting out? 
 
A: Pardon? 
 
Q: What was at the far end of that runway to keep the dog from 
getting out of that run? 
 
A: If you walk directly and went all the way to the back of the 
house, there's like an open area back there, and it's all fenced off, 
so there was no way for him to get out. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever play games with the kids, Sydney and 
Justin, over at the house there? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you ever play hide-and-go-seek? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you ever go looking for the kids back there ever? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay.  And going back to my previous question, could you tell 
me approximately the Last time you were back there prior to June 
12th, 1994? 
 
A: I couldn't tell you.  I don't remember. 
 
Q: Was it within a year? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay.  Could you tell me, after June 12th,1994 when, if ever, 
you were behind that room? 
 
MR. RE: Excluding the period. 
 
MR. KELLY: Well, I would like to know during that period if he 
was back there. 
 
MR. RE: Well, we will assert the privilege to that. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Was there any -- I think we had this discussion.  I think your 
client would have to assert the privilege. 
 
Was there any time after dune 12th, 1994 that you went to look 
behind that guesthouse? 
 
MR.RE: Are you asking him the previous question, if it was 
between -- if you ask him a specific question, was he there during 
the period, then you can get the privilege --  
 
MR. KELLY: Well, I'm going to ask him very specifically --  
 
MR. RE: -- and then you can go to a time after that, after he asserts 
the privilege to that. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  Was there any time between June 12th and June 14th 
that you had occasion to go behind that guesthouse? 
 
MR. RE: I would --  
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
MR. RE: Okay. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  Was there anytime between June 14th and June 17th you 
had occasion to go behind that guesthouse? 
 
A: I'd say no. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was there any time between June 17th and July 1st you 
had occasion to go behind that guesthouse for any reason? 
 
MR. RE: Let me just ask you a question because I want to make 
sure I have my dates right:  What was the date that Simpson 
surrendered? 
 
MR. KELLY: 17th. 
 
MR. RE: So you are asking for the period following the time of his 
--  
 
MR. KELLY: I am trying to put it -- you said "two weeks," so I am 
going June 17th to July 1st. 
 
MR. RE: Which is the two-week period following the --  
 
MR. KELLY: The surrender. 
 
MR. RE: -- surrender.  Let me just talk to him for a second. 
 
THE WITNESS: That give me -- I could talk to him, and then can I 
go to the restroom? 
 
MR. KELLY: Yeah. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Sure. 
 
THE WITNESS: Okay, thank you. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the 
time is approximately  
1:51.  (Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside 
the hearing of the reporter.) 
 
(Recess.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 2:07. 
 
MR. KELLY: Could you read the last question back? 
 
(Pending question read as follows: 
 
"Q. Okay. Was there any time between June 17th and July 1st you 
had occasion to go behind that guest house for any reason? 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. And what date was that, if you recall? 
 
A: It was well after the 17th. 
 
Q: Okay.  And before July 1st? 
 
A: I couldn't give you a direct date. 
 
Q: Okay.  But somewhere between June 17th and July lst, 1994 --  
 
A: Most likely, yes. 
 
Q: -- you had occasion to go back there?  And what was the reason 
for your going back there? 
 
A: I wanted to observe it and look at it for myself. 
 
Q: Okay. Did anybody accompany you back there? 
 
A: My first time I went back? 
 
Q: Well, when was the first time you went back there? 
 
A: First time I went back was on my own.  The second time I went 
back there was with the investigator that I had spoken with early 
on. 
 
Q: At the Marriott? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Had you already had the meeting at the Marriott with this 
investigator? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, the first time you went back there, it was within this two-
week period we're discussing? 
 
A: Yes.  Could have been.  After the 17th. 
 
Q: And what was your purpose specifically for going back there? 
 
A: I wanted to see it for myself because everything was said about 
it and I just wanted to see it for myself. 
 
Q: What had you heard said about that area back there behind the 
guesthouse? 
 
A: That that's where the glove was found, and the thump on the 
walls. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you discuss the fact that you were going back there 
with anybody prior to your first time going back there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever tell Mr. Simpson you were going back there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he ever ask you to go back there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Prior -- and the second time you went back there, this was also 
within this two-week period of June 17th to July 1st, '94? 
 
A: That I don't know.  I know I went back there a second time 
because he wanted me to meet him at the Rockingham. 
 
Q: The first time that we spoke of that you went back there, was it 
day or night? 
 
A: It was during the day. 
 
Q: And how long were you back there for? 
 
A: Few minutes. 
 
Q: Did you take any pictures?    
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you take any measurements? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you discuss the fact that you had been there, with anybody 
afterwards? 
 
A: I may have. 
 
Q: Who do you think you spoke to?  
 
A: That I don't know. 
 
Q: When you went there with this investigator the second time, did 
you go back there during the daytime or nighttime? 
 
A: During the daytime. 
 
Q: And how long were you back there for? 
 
A: A few minutes. 
 
Q: Where did you meet -- where did you originally meet the 
investigator that day prior to going back behind that area? 
 
A: I don't know if he was already there at the Rockingham address 
or we met at the same time, but I know that's where we met. 
 
Q: Did you come over to Rockingham for that specific --  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Had he contacted you about coming over there? 
 
A: Yeah, that's where he wanted me to meet him. 
 
Q: And did he say for what purpose he wanted you to meet him 
there for? 
 
A: No, I didn't -- no, he didn't. 
 
Q: And the first time you knew you were going back behind the 
guest house was when you arrived there that day? 
 
A: I don't know if he wanted me to explain to him the layout of the 
house or -- I don't think that was the sole purpose why he had me 
there: To go to the side of the house.  I think he wanted to know 
the whole layout. 
 
A: Let me ask you, this was the only investigator you had dealt 
with from Simpson's defense team up to this point? 
 
A: Yes.  I spoke to Bill Pavelick maybe one or two times. 
 
Q: Okay. And you don't remember this guy's name? 
 
A: No.  He would have -- Bill Pavelick, I'm quite sure, can give it 
to you. 
 
Q: Okay.  We will ask him.  By the way, did you ever remember 
your girlfriend's name from San Francisco? 
 
A: No.  You caused my sinuses to act up. 
 
Q: Okay.  You working on it?  
 
A: I'm working on it. 
 
Q: Okay.  Now, when you arrived at Rockingham that day to meet 
with the investigator --  
   
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- what was the first thing you did when you met with him at 
Rockingham? 
 
A: I think more or less he was asking me certain things about the 
layout of the house.  He had -- I guess he had some notes made out 
that he was pointing out. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was Mr. Re your attorney at that time? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was he aware of the fact that you were meeting with this 
investigator? 
 
MR. RE: That would call for attorney-client privileged 
information. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  When you met with him, did he have actual diagrams of 
the house? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall how long you were at Rockingham for 
that day?    
 
A: I don't know how long it was.  
 
Q: More than 10 minutes? 
 
A: Probably 10, 15 minutes. 
 
Q: Okay. Who else was there besides you and this investigator? 
 
A: I think Gigi was in the house.  Him and I was conducting what 
he was -- what him and I was doing just between the two of us.  
There was nobody else present with us. 
 
Q: Do you know if Arnelle was back in the house at that time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Were there a number of media people there when you 
went by the house? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Was that investigator living at the house at that time? 
 
A: Not that I know of. 
 
Q: Okay.  What did you do when you walked back behind the 
guesthouse with this investigator, if anything? 
 
A: He just pointed out some things --  
 
Q: What- 
 
A: -- the fence --  
 
Q: What did he point out about the fence? 
 
A: How something wasn't -- if somebody did come over the fence, 
something about there should have been some branches broken or 
the spikes at the top should have been bent over or something like 
that, and he asked me, "Why would O.J. come over this side?"  
And I said, "It's beyond me."  I mean, to me it would be the last 
place, if you knew the house, that you would come to. 
 
Q: Okay.  And what else did he point out to you? 
 
A: That the spider webs supposedly were intact on the air 
conditioning. 
 
Q: Were there spider webs there when you were back there? 
 
A:I didn't notice them. 
 
Q: Okay.  What else? 
 
A: How narrow the walkway was. 
 
Q: These were things he was pointing out to you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did he know you had spent weeks and months there over a 
period of years in that guesthouse and over at Rockingham? 
 
A: Probably. 
 
Q: Did he indicate to you why he was pointing these things out to 
you? 
 
A: He was doing his investigation. 
 
Q: Did he ask you any questions about that area back there? 
 
A: Just pointed out those things. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you tell him anything about that area back there? 
 
A: Not that I could remember. 
 
Q: Did you have any discussions concerning the glove? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you take -- did he take any photographs back there? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
 Q: Did he take any measurements?  
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Do you recall seeing him with a camera? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Was there anybody else there assisting him in any way? 
 
A: No.  Not when him and I was there, no. 
 
Q: Okay.  When you said it was the last place anybody would 
come over who knew the place, what did you mean by that? 
 
A: Just there's so many other ways to get to the grounds of O.J.'s 
house. 
 
Q: What other ways are there? 
 
A: You can come over your neighbor's -- his back neighbor's --  
through his yard, through his tennis court to right into O.J.'s tennis 
court. 
 
Q: There is a gate that opens there, isn't there? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay.  What other ways?    
 
A: Come over the wall.    
 
Q: Right in front there? 
 
A: Yeah.  Anywhere along the long wall. 
 
Q: Along Rockingham. 
 
A: Ash -- no.  Ashton. 
 
Q: Okay. 
   
A: Ashford. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Ashford. 
 
THE WITNESS: Ashford. I'm sorry.

Q: Had you ever come over the wall to Ashford yourself? 
 
A: Uh huh.  Yes.  I'm sorry. 
 
Q: Is there a big tree that comes into the wall there at someplace? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Is that usually where you would come over? 
 
A: All of us have come over that wall at one time or another. 
   
Q: Including Mr. Simpson? 
 
A:I know Nicole has.  I have. 
 
Q: Okay. Have you ever been with Mr. Simpson when he came 
over the wall? 
 
A: Not that I remember. 
 
Q: Have you ever been locked out of the premises with Mr. 
Simpson? 
 
A: Not that I can remember. 
 
Q: Okay.  The Ashford gate can be released manually with a card, 
can it not? 
 
A: The Ashford? No.  
 
Q: No?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Is there any way to open that gate manually? 
 
A: If you release the latch inside before, you can open it manually. 
 
Q: Okay.  Where does that latch have to be released from.? 
 
A: It's on the arm, the bent arm.  It's at the end of the arm where the 
controls sit.  There's a little lever you lift up, I think, and that takes 
it off of the automatic that opens from the house.  They punch a 
keyboard -- the telephone. 
 
Q: Okay.  Can that be done with the Rockingham gate also? 
 
A: No.  You need a key. 
 
Q: From the outside? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Was your question whether it can be taken off 
the manual from the automatic mode at Rockingham? 
 
MR. KELLY: Right. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's --  
 
THE WITNESS: No. He said Ashford. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: No.  And then I asked you whether the Rockingham gate could 
be taken off the automatic mode in the same manner as the Ashford 
gate. 
 
A: Oh, yes, it can. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: So either the Ashford gate or the Rockingham gate, if you 
punch in a code, it can be left on manual release? 
 
A: No, no, no, uh-uh, not a code.  Manual, you have to lift up the 
lever that sits right at the base of the arm. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: And that takes it off of automatic.  You go open it up with your 
hand.  But if --  
 
Q: And --  
 
A: Go ahead. 
 
Q: That can be done from inside the gate? 
 
A: That can only be done from inside the gate. 
 
Q: Okay.  That can be done with either Ashford or Rockingham? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Have you ever done that with the Ashford gate? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Have you ever done that at the Rockingham gate? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  When you -- I think you indicated -- Was there ever a 
time that you stayed in the guesthouse for any length of time when 
Nicole and O.J. were living there? 
 
A: Could have. 
 
Q: Okay.  Were there many times you spent the night there at 
Rockingham when they were there? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Were there times you spent the night there when Nicole 
was there and Simpson was out of town also? 
 
A: If Nicole was scared, she would call me and I would stay up 
there, yes. 
 
Q: Where? In the guesthouse? 
 
A: Uh-huh. Yes. I'm sorry. 
 
Q: Okay, Would it be fair to say that you would see Nicole under 
her most casual moments when you were staying there at 
Rockingham? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to casual. Vague. 
 
THE WITNESS: What do you mean by "casual"? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Well, I mean, would you sit and talk to her right before she was 
going to bed? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Would you see her first thing in the morning when she 
first got up? 
 
A: Yeah, if we have tea. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you ever do that on occasion? 
 
A: Yeah, I used to drink a lot of tea. She had Sydney to buy me a 
little tea cup.  So Sydney would watch me drink tea. 
 
Q: Okay.  And as I asked you before, there were times you would 
see Nicole first thing in the morning when she came downstairs? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Were there ever times you saw blemishes on Nicole's 
face where she had been, say, picking blackheads or something like 
that? 
 
A: Nicole would pick at her skin sometimes. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever see blemishes as a result of that? 
 
A: I would tease her about it:  She should, you know, stop picking 
at her skin, because it only made it worse.  She had a tendency of 
doing that. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you ever see her cause pronounced markings on her 
face from picking at blackheads? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection to "pronounced." 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know what you mean by "pronounced."  I 
would tell -- because a lot of times Nicole would sit and she'd be 
picking, and I would like hit her on her hand. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Was it a nervous habit? 
 
A: Yeah, she did that and bit her nails. 
 
Q: Okay. That was a nervous habit also? 
 
A: I don't know nervous. She did it.  You know, we all tried to get 
her to stop. 
 
Q: But I am asking you, with her face, did you ever see, as I said, 
pronounced marks from her picking at blackheads? 
 
A: I would see her pick, and I would tell her to stop picking. 
 
Q: Were there ever times you just saw her face and could tell she 
had been picking at it? 
 
A: I can't remember. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall when Nicole was pregnant with Sydney?  
First time she was pregnant after she and O.J. had gotten married. 
 
A: Yeah.  Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall how you first found out Nicole was 
pregnant? 
 
A: I think the two of them told me. 
 
Q: Okay.  And were you around Rockingham during that period of 
time when she was pregnant? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you have dinner there sometimes? 
 
A: Yes, or I would come by and do things for Nicole.  I didn't want 
her to lift anything heavy, and I would, you know -- Nicole is, like I 
said, is a doer, and she just -- and you got to sit Nicole down.  She 
will, you know, do whatever it is necessary to run that house. 
 
Q: So she wouldn't call you up and ask you to come over and do 
things for her? 
 
A: Oh, she would call me and ask me to come over, yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you know that if you didn't come over, she would 
probably do them herself? 
 
A: Most likely, yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  So would it be fair to say that she just wouldn't do them 
if someone didn't do them for her, would she? 
 
A: Pardon? 
 
Q: Strike that.  That's a horrendous question.  Did you ever hear 
Simpson comment to Nicole about her weight when she was 
pregnant with Sydney?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Ever?  
 
A: No  
 
Q: Okay.  Did you ever observe any arguments between Simpson 
and Nicole when she was pregnant with Sydney? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you remember the day Sydney was born? 
   
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you visit Nicole in the hospital?   
 
A: I was there, yes. 
 
Q: Was Simpson there also? 
   
A: Yes. 
   
Q: And was Nicole excited after Sydney was born?  
 
A: The two of them were. 
 
Q: Okay. When Sydney was born, you had been friends with 
Nicole for almost 10 years? 
   
A: Yeah.  Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And you had spent a lot of time with her at this point? 
   
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And you had spent a lot of time with her when Simpson 
was on the road? 
 
A: I would go by to see if she's okay, of if she wanted me to do 
something, I would go by. 
 
Q: And you considered her family at that time?  
 
A: Oh, yes. 
 
Q: And she considered you family? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Were there times that Simpson confided in you 
regarding his relationship with Nicole?    
 
A: Confided in me to what level? 
 
Q: Well, just how things were going with him and Nicole, if there 
were any problems? 
 
A: He was great.  It was great.  I mean, she was everything he 
wanted in a woman.  She --  
 
Q: Okay.  Never complained about her? 
 
A: There was nothing to complain about Nicole. 
 
Q: Okay.  He never complained about her.    
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Were there times that Nicole confided to you about her 
relationship with Simpson? 
 
A: Sometimes she would voice her displeasure, not knowing -- I 
mean, because of maybe the past, maybe she would question or -- I 
shouldn't say question.  She would be under suspicion maybe he 
was fooling around. 
 
Q: Okay.  Would it be fair to say that Nicole trusted you more than 
probably anybody else she knew? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: That I wouldn't know. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  Was there any doubt in your mind as to whether or not 
Nicole loved you as a friend? 
 
A: We had a good friendship. 
 
Q: Okay.  And she loved you? 
 
A: She never told me she loved me, but I know we had a good 
friendship. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you love her? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Is there any doubt in your mind that Nicole would have 
done anything to help you if you asked her for it? 
 
A: No doubt in my mind. 
 
Q: Okay. And would you have done anything for Nicole if asked to 
do it, also? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Would it be fair to say that the entire Brown family also treated 
you like family? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did Nicole ever disappoint you? 
 
A: Not that I can remember, no. 
 
Q: She ever let you down in anyway? 
 
A: Not that I can remember. 
 
Q: Okay.  Now, prior to Sydney's birth in 1986, talking about when 
Sydney was born all the way back to the time Simpson met Nicole.  
Now I am going to ask you some questions. Okay? 
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q: So this would be probably from 1977 to '86, about a 10-year 
period. 
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q: Okay.  Other than the arguments we previously spoke about, 
which would be the incident in San Francisco and the time where 
Nicole threw the picture at O.J., were there any other arguments 
you witnessed between --  
 
A: I was told that she threw the picture.  I wasn't there, so I don't 
know if the picture was thrown at him or she just threw it out of the 
car.  I don't know.  I was told that. 
 
Q: Who told you that? 
 
A: Nicole told me -- O.J. told me first.  Then Nicole told me later 
on. 
 
Q: Okay.  But then you were back at Rockingham when Nicole 
came back there? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Other than those two incidences, was there any other 
time that you observed any arguments between Nicole and 
Simpson prior to Sydney's birth?    
 
A: No.    
 
Q: Did you ever observe any physical altercations between Nicole 
and Simpson in this time period up through 1986? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You never observed Simpson strike Nicole --  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- during this time period? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Never slap her? 
 
A: No.  Not in front of me.  
 
Q: Okay. Ever punch her?    
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Kick her?    
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Push her?    
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Grab her by the arm? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Throw her?    
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Did --     
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The time frame for this series of questions? 
 
MR. KELLY: We are talking about any time prior to Sydney's 
birth in 1986 now. 
 
THE WITNESS: From the time they met until Sydney was born. 
 
BY MR. KELLY:    
 
Q: Right.    
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Okay. In the same time period, did Simpson ever tell you of any 
physical altercation he had with Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: In the same time frame, did Nicole ever tell you of any physical 
altercation she had with Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did Nicole ever tell you that -- and this is in the same 
time period still.  Did Nicole ever tell that you Simpson had 
slapped her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Ever tell you that he had punched her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Ever tell you that he had kicked her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Ever tell you that he had pushed her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Cheated on her? 
 
A: Has she ever said that --     
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: -- to me?    
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Yes, she has.   
 
Q: A number of times? 
 
A: I don't know how many times, but she has, you know, said, you 
know, she suspected him cheating on her.  
 
Q: Okay.  In this same time frame, do you know of any time that 
Simpson kicked Nicole out of the house? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague as to "kicked...out of the 
house." 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Made her leave. 
 
A: Not to my knowledge.  If he did, I wasn't there. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was there any time after the fact Simpson told you he 
had kicked her out of the house? 
 
A: I heard of an incident that happened with O.J., Nicole, Denise 
and [Name Deleted], but I wasn't there, so I don't know what 
happened. 
 
Q: Okay.  Other than that incident, any others? 
 
A: I mean --  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Same time frame?    
 
MR. KELLY: Yeah, same time frame still. 
 
THE WITNESS: I mean, once he got upset with Nicole.  
Dominique had came up, and a friend of mine called him to meet 
Dominique and they -- he came over -- I had left before he got 
there, and they went out, and I got a call later on that night; it was 
O.J.; he was out of town, and woke me up. I don't know what time 
it was, but it was late.  And he called and he said, "Hey, man, 
what's going on?. 
 
I said, "Nothing man. I'm asleep.  What's going on?" 
 
He said -- did he ask me where Nicole was?  I said, "I don't know.  
Maybe she went out with Dominique and Tom to" -- I think they 
went out to get something --  
 
BY MR. KELLY: .    
 
Q: Who is Tom? 
 
A: I don't know his last name. 
 
Q: McCullum? 
 
A: No. No. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: This was a young guy.  And I introduced the two of them, and I 
think he invited them out to dinner. 
 
Q: This was someone you had introduced Dominique to? 
 
A: Right.  He came by the house to meet Dominique. 
 
Q: And Dominique came up from Laguna? 
 
A: Yes, she was up.  I don't know if it was during the week or 
during the weekend, but she was there, and --     
 
Q: Okay.  And where did they meet?    
 
A: There at the house. 
 
Q: At Rockingham. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And they left there then? 
 
A: I think the three of them left, Nicole, Dominique and Tom.   
 
Q: Did Nicole know Tom?   
 
A: No.  I knew Tom. 
 
Q: Okay.  Nicole never met Tom before --  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- this night?  Okay.  What year was this? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Was it before they were married?    
 
A: I think so. 
 
Q: Okay.  What happened next? 
 
A: I got a phone call from O.J. later on that night, wanted to know 
-- I told him I introduced Dominique to Tom, and I guess he took 
them all out to dinner. 
 
Q: Tom did?    
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. And what was Simpson calling about? 
 
A: I guess he wanted to know.  I guess he had called the house, and 
I guess he found out that Nicole was out or Nicole had been out, 
and I guess my name must have came up in the conversation, so he 
called me. 
 
Q: And what else did he say to you other than, "What's going on?" 
 
A: That was it. And I hung up the phone.  Then --  
 
Q: Mr. Cowlings, this whole line of questioning started when I 
asked you if you knew of any other --  
 
A Well --  
 
Q: We're getting to it? 
 
A: You said you were slow.  Anyway, I come to find out two days 
-- a day later that an argument had started behind this. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: See, I wasn't -- up until when O.J. called me, I just assumed he 
was trying to find out  where Nicole was.  I mean, it wasn't no big 
thing as far as I was concerned. 
 
Q: Okay.  And what did you find out a day or two later? 
 
A: That he got upset that she left the house. 
 
Q: Where was Simpson when he called you? 
 
A: He was out of town somewhere. 
 
Q: Do you know where? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Who told you the argument started? 
 
A: I don't know if he did or Nicole did.  The argument was over the 
phone. 
 
Q: Between Simpson and Nicole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you know when that argument took place? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was it that same night later, do you know? 
 
A: I don't know.  Like I said, when he called me, he gave me no 
indication that it was any problems. He was just, you know --  
 
Q: What time of night was it? 
 
A: I was asleep, so I don't know what time it was. 
 
Q: After 9:00? 
 
A: Could have been.  Could have been before 9:00. 
 
Q: Okay.  And that's all you know about this argument? 
 
A: Yeah, that it started an argument between the two of them over 
the phone. 
 
Q: Okay.  And what about the incident with [Name Deleted], 
Denise and Nicole and O.J., what were you told about that? 
 
A: That they got into an --  
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. No foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: That they got into an argument. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: That who got into an argument?    
 
A: All four of them. 
 
Q: Who told you this? 
 
A: I think O.J. did. 
 
Q: What did he tell you exactly happened? 
 
A: All of them had been drinking.  I think it had something to do 
with Nicole -- O.J. didn't allow any smoking in the house, and it 
was -- that was understood by everybody whoever smoked. 
 
Q: Nicole smoked, didn't she? 
 
A: Right.  And Nicole would go outside and smoke. 
 
Q: Did he like that Nicole smoked?  
 
A: No, but --  
 
Q: Did he express the fact that he didn't like that she smoked? 
 
A: He would like her to quit smoking, but he never told her she 
couldn't smoke. 
 
Q: Would it make sense for him to ever give her, say, a lighter as a 
present? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know if he did or not. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Anyway, I'm sorry. Go on with... 
 
A: And the argument started actually, for what I was told, between 
him and Denise. 
 
Q: Okay. And why did he say the argument started? 
 
A: Because Denise felt that O.J. -- I think should allow Nicole to 
smoke in the house. Nicole -- like I said, it was understood if you 
smoked, you go outside, either off the front door or step off by the 
pool and do your smoking.  When you finish, you came back into 
the house. 
 
Q: And what is your understanding of what happened this night 
with regards to smoking? 
 
A: Him and Denise got into an argument. 
 
Q: Did Nicole come inside and start smoking, do you know? 
 
A: That I don't know. 
 
Q: Did someone else come in and start smoking? 
 
A: That I don't know. 
 
Q: Did he tell you what type of argument they had? 
 
A: That they got into an argument, and they left. 
 
Q: And who left? 
 
A: [Name Deleted], Denise and Nicole. 
 
Q: Did he ever tell you he made them leave? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he ever tell you he physically removed Nicole from the 
house? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Nicole ever tell you that? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Did Denise ever tell you that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did [Name Deleted] ever tell you that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever discuss this incident with Denise? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever discuss this incident with [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever discuss this incident with Nicole? 
 
A: No 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. I've got to take a break here. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the 
time is approximately 2:36. 
 
(Recess.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 2:52. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did you ever observe any injuries on Nicole prior to Sydney 
being born? 
 
A: She fell off the roof once; injured her back. 
 
Q: What roof? 
 
A: Rockingham roof.    
 
Q: Of the house? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What was she doing up there? 
 
A: Hanging Christmas trees -- I mean Christmas lights. 
 
Q: What year was this? 
 
A: Nicole did it every year.  She would line the house with 
Christmas lights, and the fence. 
 
Q: What year did she fall off? 
 
A: I don't know what particular year, but I know she fell off. 
 
Q: She wasn't pregnant at the time she fell off? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was it prior to her marrying Simpson? 
 
A: I think it could have been. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know if she went to the hospital for that? 
 
A: Not that I know of. 
 
Q: Were you there when she fell off? 
 
A: No.  I found out about it the next day. 
 
Q: Do you know which roof that was that she fell off? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know how far a distance she fell to the ground? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know whether she stayed in bed at all the next day after 
that happened? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know what type of injury she had has a result --  
 
A: She said her back was stiff. 
 
Q: Did you see her after the fall? 
 
A: Yeah.  Not directly after the fall, but I did see her later on. 
 
Q: Like how long after the fall? 
 
A: Could have been a day or two days. 
 
Q: Okay.  And she indicated to you her back was still stiff? 
 
A: It was stiff, but Nicole continued to do -- you know, not to get 
back up on the roof.  I think after then the gardener -- O.J. paid the 
gardener extra to do that.  He didn't want Nicole back up there 
again. 
 
Q: When you said Nicole was Nicole and you sort of shrugged, 
you meant little things like that wouldn't bother her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Would it be fair to say that Nicole wouldn't pamper herself? 
 
A: When you say "pamper," like what? 
 
Q: Well, in terms of -- 
 
A: Doing her nails and stuff or --  
 
Q: No. In terms of if she had an ache or pain, she wouldn't like go 
running to the doctor? 
 
A: No, Nicole -- Nicole was -- motor was always going.  You 
know, she'd work -- whatever duties that was to be done around the 
house, she did.  You know, if she had a cold or, you know, she 
always stayed active. 
 
Q: Okay.  It was tough to slow her down, then? 
 
A: Oh, yeah, definitely. 
 
Q: Okay.  And she'd -- By the way, who told you she had fallen off 
the roof? 
 
A: She did. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I hate to interrupt, but if we are going to go to 
5:00, I have to make a phone call. 
 
MR. KELLY: I don't want to go -- actually, I understood the tape is 
going to be out in about a half hour or so, and why don't we go till 
that time since we had originally planned on it, anyway. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Okay. 
 
MR. KELLY: We will go to the original quitting time: 3:30. 
 
MR.LEONARD: And then we will stop? 
 
MR. KELLY: Yeah. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Okay. 
 
MR. BREWER: For a break and then resume or stop for the day? 
 
MR. KELLY: Which do you want to do? 
 
MR. BREWER: I can go on. 
 
MR. KELLY: Want to go to about 4:15, 4:30? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Well, then I need to make a phone call right 
now. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Just make it right now. 
 
MR. BREWER: So we are going to go till 4:30, then? 
 
MR. KELLY: Yeah, go to 4:30. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Well, we need to go off the record for one 
minute.

BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Mr. Cowlings, would it be fair to say that Nicole was not 
someone who would complain about every little ache and pain that 
she had? 
 
A: Yeah, I would say so. 
 
Q: And would it be fair to say also she wouldn't complain, like you 
said before, if she had a cold or a headache or something like that? 
 
A: I mean, I would know that she had a cold, but Nicole wouldn't --  
 
Q: She wouldn't put herself in bed, would she? 
 
A: She wouldn't stay in bed for the next three days.  No, that's not 
Nicole. 
 
Q: And if -- like you said, when she hurt her back or some injury 
like that, she wouldn't go running to a doctor right away either, 
would she? 
 
A: I guess she felt that it wasn't serious enough to go to the doctor. 
 
Q: Okay.  And as far as you were concerned, it would take 
something that at least Nicole would perceive as serious before she 
would see a doctor for an ache or pain or injury? 
 
A: I would think so, yeah. 
 
Q: She was a very athletic person? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Fitness conscious? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. In good shape? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When you first met Nicole, would it be fair to say that Simpson 
was your closest friend? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And when Simpson moved into Rockingham in 1980, 
would it be fair to say that Simpson was your closest friend then? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when Nicole and Simpson got married in 1985, would it be 
fair to say that Simpson was still your closest friend? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And in '92 when Nicole and Simpson divorced, was Simpson 
still your closest friend then? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And in 199 -- Well, strike that.  You're aware of the fact 
that in 1993 Nicole and Simpson reconciled again, got back 
together? 
   
A: I don't know if that was the year, but --  
 
Q: You know they got back together --  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- after the divorce?  Okay.  And you were still Simpson's 
closest friend during this time period? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And as of even June 12th, 1994, Simpson was your closest 
friend? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And as you sit here today and testify, would it be fair to 
say that Simpson is still your closest friend? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And as you sit here today, would it be fair to say that in 
your mind you are O.J. Simpson's closest friend? 
 
A: In my own mind, yes, I would think so, yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Has Mr. Simpson ever lent you money in the past? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you always pay that back?    
 
A: Sometimes. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever run into some financial difficulty with the 
place you had off [Address Deleted] when you lived in LA.? 
 
A: [Address Deleted]? 
 
Q: [Address Deleted] Road? 
 
A: [Address Deleted] Road, no.  I never lived on [Address 
Deleted]. 
 
Q: Did you ever own a condo?   
 
A: No.    
 
Q: No?    
 
MR. RE: On [Address Deleted] Road?   
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know what he's talking about. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Near [Address Deleted] Road.  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever own a place that Mr. Simpson and [Name 
Deleted] had to buy from you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Where was that located?    
 
A: That was on [Address Deleted]. 
 
Q: [Address Deleted]. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And was that a condominium? 
 
A: No.  A duplex. 
 
Q: A condominium duplex. 
 
A: No. A duplex.  That's what it's called: a duplex. 
 
Q: Out West here?  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was it a single-family detached structure? 
 
A: It's two units.  One unit I lived in; the other unit I rented out. 
 
Q: Sort of like the Bundy place that Nicole lived at at the end: 
Attached units? 
 
A: I didn't know that her place was attached. 
 
Q: Okay.  All right.  But there came a time when Mr. Simpson and 
[Name Deleted] bought that from you? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay.  What year was that? 
 
A: It would have been in the -- I don't know -- the mid '80s, late 
'80s, I think. 
 
Q: And you always felt that Mr. Simpson would help you if you 
needed it?    
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And would it be fair to say that you'd always be there to 
help Mr. Simpson if he needed it? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: I believe you described Nicole earlier as a nice person? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And you still stand by that testimony?    
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Did you know her always to be an honest person? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you ever know her to be deceptive in any way? 
 
A: Not that I can remember.    
 
Q: Did she ever lie to you? 
 
A: She never had a reason to. 
 
Q: Did she ever lie to you? 
 
A: Not that I know of. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you know if she ever lied to anybody else?    
 
A: That I don't know.  
 
Q: Was Nicole the kind of person that would make things up? 
 
A: I have no knowledge of that. 
 
Q: Did she strike you as someone who would make things up? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague.  
 
THE WITNESS: I have no idea. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you feel you could trust her? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was Nicole a good mother? 
 
A: Great mother. 
 
Q: Great mother.  In what ways was she a great mother? 
 
A: Her kids were everything to her.  She really took -- she really 
took to motherhood, and her kids were very important to her. 
 
Q: Was she very involved in their lives? 
 
A: Yes, she was. 
 
Q: Was she very organized with their lives? 
 
A: Yes, she was. 
 
Q: Did she make sure they had everything they needed? 
 
A: That's right, yes. 
 
Q: Give them all the attention they could ever want from a mother? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was she a good wife? 
   
A: Yes. 
   
Q: Great wife? 
 
A: She was a good wife. She was. 
 
Q: Okay. Always good to Simpson?    
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Very supportive of him? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Very protective of him? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Know of any incident where she ever deceived him? 
 
A: Not to my knowledge. 
 
Q: Ever cheated on him when they were married? 
 
A: Not to my knowledge.    
 
Q: Ever lied to him? 
 
A: Not to my knowledge. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was Nicole always sensitive to Simpson's public image? 
 
A: When you say "sensitive," what do you mean? 
 
Q: She would never have done anything to embarrass him, would 
she?    
 
A: Not that I know of. 
 
Q: Was she very good about keeping the children out of public 
scrutiny? 
 
A: I think her and O.J. both agreed on that. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you know whether she kept the kids active in kids' 
activities? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Justin always engaged in sporting activities? 
 
A: As he got older.  They were so active around the house because 
the grounds of the house was geared to the children, the play area 
out in front, so --  
 
Q: And who had set it up that way? 
 
A: O.J. and Nicole. 
 
Q: And would Nicole always participate with the kids in what they 
were doing? 
 
A: Yes. 
   
Q: Play ball with them? 
 
A: O.J. would. Nicole would be watching.  Both of them were 
active with the kids. 
 
Q: Okay.  Going to a different time period now, which would be 
after Sydney was born, okay, did you ever observe any arguments 
between Nicole and Simpson? 
 
A: You said prior --  
 
Q: No. Now we are talking about after Sydney's birth. 
 
A: There was an argument during the construction of the house. 
 
Q: What was that argument about? 
 
A: I have no idea.  They were yelling at each other. 
 
Q: You were there then? 
 
A: Yes, I was there. 
 
Q: Okay.  This was during the renovation Nicole was doing? 
 
A: Yeah, it was -- it was -- it -- during the renovation -- it took a lot 
longer than they expected.  Everything was in shambles.  You 
know, they expected to be in at a certain time and it wasn't, so I 
guess everybody's nerves were on edge. 
 
Q: Were they living somewhere else while the renovation was 
going on? 
 
A: I don't think so. 
 
Q: What part of the house inside other than the kitchen was being 
renovated? 
 
A: The back facing the pool, all that was redone --  
 
Q: The family room-type thing? 
 
A: Family room. 
 
Q: All the glass -- go on, Mr. Cowlings.  I'm sorry. 
 
A: The family room, the fireplace, the bar, outside the pool area, all 
that was redone.  The pool -- there was a new pool.  They stoned 
the front of the house, new driveway.  They stoned the back of  the 
house along the guest rooms. 
 
Q: Tell me about the argument they had. 
 
A: I assumed that it started -- basically it was something about -- it 
had something to do with the house. 
 
Q: What did you hear Nicole say? 
 
A: All I knew, I was sitting outside and I think I had Sydney with 
me, and Nicole was in the jacuzzi and her and O.J. were talking.  
All of a sudden Nicole just started yelling at him. 
 
Q: What did she say? 
 
A: I just grabbed Sydney and I walked in the house because I didn't 
want Sydney to hear it. 
 
Q: You were near them when this started? 
 
A: Yeah.  I heard -- the yelling started with Nicole, and then I 
grabbed Sydney, because it was kinda like Nicole was pretty loud 
and --  
 
Q: Always? 
 
A: Pardon? 
 
Q: When you say, "Nicole was pretty loud," do you mean this 
particular incident? 
 
A: She was loud that particular time. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: And I grabbed Sydney because it kinda like caught Sydney -- 
caught me and Sydney by surprise, and I picked Sydney up and I 
walked in the house. 
 
Q: What did you hear Nicole saying? 
 
A: I don't know.  I didn't want Sydney to hear it; I didn't want 
Sydney to see it, so I walked in the house with Sydney. 
 
Q: Did you hear Simpson say anything? 
 
A: I don't know if he did or not, to be honest with you. 
 
Q: How old was Sydney at that time? 
 
A: I don't know if she was two or three.  Probably three, I think.  I 
don't know for sure. 
 
Q: Do you know whether Nicole was pregnant at this time? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Well, Sydney was at least two years old? 
 
A: Something like that, I think. 
 
Q: And Sydney was born in 1986? 
 
A: Yeah, I guess that's when she was born, yes. 
 
Q: And Justin hadn't been born yet? 
 
A: I don't know. I don't know if he was or not. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you ever discuss this argument afterwards with 
Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever discuss this argument afterwards with Nicole? 
 
A: The only thing I said to Nicole was that it was a bad thing for 
Sydney to see. 
 
Q: This was after the argument had ended? 
 
A: Either -- maybe later on, probably a day later or two days later. 
 
Q: What did Nicole say? 
 
A: She agreed. 
 
Q: Was she upset that she had yelled in front of Sydney?  
 
A: Yeah, I think so.  
 
Q: Okay.  Did she strike you as being sorry she had yelled in front 
of Sydney? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know.  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Now talking about this period after Sydney was born, did you 
ever observe any physical altercations between Nicole and 
Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Ever observe O.J. get angry at Nicole? 
 
A: After --  
 
Q: After Sydney had been born. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: All the way to the present? 
 
THE WITNESS: To now?    
 
MR. KELLY: Yeah. 
 
THE WITNESS: There was a situation in Hawaii. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  That was the one when you were all on vacation that 
Christmas?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Other than -- and it was at Charo's? 
 
A: Pardon? 
 
Q: Charo's, the restaurant --  
 
A: I think was it. 
 
Q: -- with Nicole and all those guys?  
 
A: Yeah, we were all in the -- yeah, I guess that was the restaurant. 
 
Q: Okay.  Other than that incident, can you think of any others 
where you saw Simpson get angry at Nicole? 
 
Actually, I had asked -- me stop for a second.  Let me see my last 
question.  Okay.  Other than that one incident in Hawaii, did you 
ever observe any other time when Simpson got angry at Nicole? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did you ever observe Simpson strike Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did Simpson ever tell you he had struck Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Nicole ever tell you that Simpson had struck her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Never?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever take Nicole to a doctor at Simpson's request? 
 
A: I took her to -- drove her to the hospital. 
 
Q: And when was that?  
 
A: This was in '89. 
 
Q: That was New Year's Day?    
 
A: New Year's night. 
 
Q: New Year's night?    
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Other than that one time, was there any other time you 
accompanied Nicole to the hospital? 
 
A: When she gave birth to her kids. 
 
Q: Other than when she gave birth to her kids? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Ever take Nicole to any doctor for any reason, like to a doctor's 
office, not the hospital? 
 
A: I took her to a dentist's office.  She said -- she was having some 
major work done, and she couldn't drive afterwards, so I took her; 
came back and got her. 
 
Q: Do you recall what year that was?  
 
A: No, I can't remember. 
 
Q: Would you be able to approximate for me? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know the name of the dentist? 
 
A: No.  It was in Beverly Hills.  I think she had some teeth 
removed or something like that. 
 
Q: Do you know whether that was after or before that New Year's 
Day 1989 --  
 
A: That was before, way before. 
 
Q: Way before? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Was it before they were married? 
 
A: I don't know if it was before or during when they were married. 
 
Q: Did you ever talk to Simpson regarding any fights he had had 
with Nicole during this time period after Sydney was born? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever see Nicole strike Simpson? 
 
A: I think Nicole slapped O.J. once. 
 
Q: When was that? 
 
A: I couldn't tell you exactly when. 
 
Q: Could you approximate for me? 
 
A: I wouldn't -- it had -- it was during a period that they had been 
together. 
 
Q: Do you know where it was that she slapped him? 
 
A: I think it was in the kitchen of Rockingham. 
 
Q: Was she living there at that time? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was anybody else present there besides you? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Do you recall why she slapped him? 
 
A: No.  I don't know if O.J. said something smart aleck to her or 
something like that.  She just hauled off and popped him. 
 
Q: What did Simpson do after she popped him? 
 
A: Looked stupid. 
 
Q: He looked stupid? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Ho w long did he look stupid for? 
 
A: I didn't time it.  I don't know how long. 
 
Q: Did he ever discuss it with you afterwards? 
 
A: I guess he felt he deserved it. 
 
Q: He didn't complain about it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did she ever discuss that with you after the fact? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever see Nicole kick Simpson? 
 
A: I personally never saw her kick O.J. 
 
Q: Did someone --  
 
A: I never -- huh? 
 
Q: I am sorry. Go on. 
 
A: Go ahead. 
 
Q: Go on.  I interrupted you. 
 
A: No, that's all right.  I'll let you get away with it this time. 
 
Q: Okay. Thank you.  Did someone ever tell you that Nicole had 
kicked Simpson? 
 
A: I don't know if O.J. mentioned it to me, that Nicole kicked him. 
To be honest with you, I don't know, 
 
Q: Do you know whether this was after or before New Year's Day 
1989? 
 
A: I have no knowledge. 
 
Q: What exactly did he tell you when he said that had Nicole 
kicked him? 
 
A: It was a vague thing.  I don't know if she did or not.  I think he 
mentioned something about her kicking him, but I don't know if it 
was in jest or a playful thing or whatever.  I don't know --  
 
Q: He wasn't complaining about the pain, was he? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: He wasn't afraid of Nicole, was he? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you been able to remember that girlfriend's name from 
San Francisco? 
 
A: No.  My sinuses are backed up.  I barely can hear you. 
 
Q: I'll speak louder. 
 
A: I'll probably get it to you. 
 
MR. BREWER: Along with that check. 
 
MR. KELLY: Huh? 
 
MR. BREWER: Along with that check. 
 
MR. KELLY: That's right. That was already mailed? 
 
Q: Do you recall the San Francisco incident in '77 we were talking 
before about where Simpson had thrown all Nicole's clothes out 
the window?  Do you recall that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you recall any time any discussion that Nicole had accused 
him of sleeping with some girl named Terry? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Ever hear of a girl named Terry that Simpson was ever going 
out with? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you recall during that incident ever hearing Simpson call 
Nicole a F**king bitch? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you recall ever hearing him call her a motherF**ker during 
that incident? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you ever recall him using that kind of language with Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was there ever an incident where -- or did you ever discuss any 
injuries with Nicole that she had gotten falling off a bike? 
   
A: I didn't even know Nicole fell off a bike. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you ever -- you never took her to St. John's Hospital 
for any reason relating to a fall off a bike? 
 
A: No.  I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay.  Before we were talking about a conversation you had 
with Judy in the last month or so down at Laguna?  Do you 
remember having a conver --  
 
A: I been down there a lot. 
 
Q: I said in the last month or so. 
 
A: The last couple weeks, yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Last couple weeks you had a conversation down at 
Laguna with Judy Brown? 
 
A: Well, we were trying to have a conversation, but she was pretty 
upset. 
 
Q: Okay. Can you tell me what she said and what you said during 
that conversation? 
 
A: She was addressing issues to me about O.J. and the kids where 
she should have been addressing O.J. 
   
Q: Okay.  Other than issues involving the kids, did she say 
anything to you about you not protecting Nicole from O.J.? 
 
A: She -- no.  What she said to me, she called me either -- I don't 
know if she called me a coward or she called me something, and 
she said 1  something about O.J. controlling me, and then she told 
me I could influence O.J.  And she was all sporadic; she was up 
and down, so I couldn't make heads or tails what Judy exactly was 
trying to say to me. 
 
Q: Did you ever say something to the effect that, "I told Nicole to 
tell the truth, but even when she went to the doctor, she told them 
she had fallen off a bike"? 
 
A: No, I did not say that. 
 
Q: Did you have any conversation --  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- like that at all? 
 
A: I didn't have that conversation with Judy.  I had that 
conversation with Lou. 
 
Q: That was the same day? 
 
A: The same day. 
 
Q: Could you tell me about that conversation? 
 
A: Lou started in on me --  
 
Q: How did he start in on you? 
 
A: He -- she -- he started on me in the same vein about not -- how 
did he start.  First with O.J., about how nobody wants him down 
here and stuff and why did he come down, and I said, "Well, the 
psychologist in his conversations with O.J., O.J. told him that 
Justin had been calling him for him to come down to watch him 
play basketball." 
 
And the psychologist said, "Well, if that's the case, you should go." 
 
I did not know until after all this happened that the Browns didn't 
know that O.J. was coming down. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: When we got down there --  
 
Q: I am sorry.  O.J. didn't tell you that --  
 
A: No, O.J. did not tell me that the Browns did not know he was 
coming down there. I was under the impression that everybody 
knew, because Justy -- him and -- Justy had called; he knew where 
to go; he knew the time.  When I got there -- when we got there, we  
didn't know if we were in the -- if it was the right time or we got 
the right place.  I said, "Well, let's call the Browns." 
 
And he says, "No, no, no.  Let's ride around a little longer." 
 
So I said, "O.J., it's senseless to be driving around.  Why don't we 
call the Browns to find out if we have the right place or the right 
time or whatever, if it is today?" 
 
So he said, "Well, call on Sydney's phone." 
 
So I called on Sydney's phone.  There was no answer.  I said, 
"Why don't we just call Judy?" So I called Judy, I told who I was, 
and I said, "Judy, we here to see Justy play basketball." 
 
And she said, "Who?"  I said, "O.J. and I"  And she got upset and 
she said, "What is this all about?"  She said, "Let me speak to 
him." 
 
They spoke.  That ended.  We go to -- we were at the right place.  
The time was later than the time that we were there.  The game 
started at 8:00. 
 
So we got there.  I got out of the car.  Dominique pulled up with 
Sydney and Justy.  We embraced, the kids and I spoke to 
Dominique, she spoke, and then we went into --  
 
Q: Did she speak to Simpson, by the way? 
 
A: I don't remember.  I doubt it.  We walked in the gym and we 
watched Justy warm-up, and I don's know how long before that 
Judy walks in, she sits behind me and she says, "I want to talk to 
you" -- 
 
Q: Were you sitting with Simpson at that time? 
 
A: I was sitting next to Dominique.  Sydney was sitting next -- I 
was sitting next to Dominique, Dominique was sitting next to 
Sydney, Sydney was sitting next to O.J.  Judy said, "I want to talk 
to you."  So we go outside -- we walk out in the hallway and I think 
she referred to me as a coward or gutless or something like that.  
And I said, "Well, Judy, if you want to talk to me, let's step 
outside," because people were walking in and out.  As we got 
outside, she just was throwing her arms up, yelling and --  
 
Q: What was she saying? 
 
A: I don't know exactly.  You know, one thing led to another.  
Then one of -- I guess a friend of hers or somebody said, "You 
want me to call the cops or call the police?"  And Judy said, "No."  
I'm standing there.  I'm saying, what -- I'm feeling awkward, stupid. 
You know, I'm out here; for what reason, I have no idea.  She 
brought up the issue about O.J. being down there, and I said, 
"Well, why don't you talk to him?"  "No."  Then she says 
something about -- I said, "Well, the psychologist said" -- "told O.J. 
to come down." 
 
And she says, "Well, I talked to the psychologist this morning.  He 
said O.J. read into it the way he wanted to read into it." 
 
And I said, "Well, it's obvious that the psychologist should bring 
both of -- all of you guys on the same page.  Whatever he's talking 
with O.J. concerning the kids, he should relay that to you guys, and 
vice versa.  Why you guys sitting down -- jumping down my 
goddamn throat, I have no idea. 
 
Then Lou walked up, and he started in on me --  
 
Q: How did he start in on you? 
 
A: About, "Nobody wants him down here. He's not" --  
 
Q: "Him" referring to Simpson? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: So I say, "Hey, you know, he's down here because his son wants 
him to watch" -- "his son wants him to watch him play basketball. 
What is the big deal? He's going to have the kids, anyway." 
 
That was his weekend to have the kids.  We was there to pick him 
up.  At 10:00 o'clock we were going to come back up to L.A. with 
the two kids. 
 
He said something about a scene.  I said, "There's no scene here.  If 
anybody's making a scene here, it's Judy. O.J. hasn't done 
anything." 
 
Then Lou started in on me again.  Then he accused me of knowing 
that O.J. killed Nicole, and I flat out told him, how dare he point a 
finger at me, saying -- in other words, if O.J. did do this, he's trying 
to say that I'm part of it because I know? 
 
I said -- I expressed that -- my feelings towards Nicole. 
 
He said, "Well, you been friends with O.J. for 40 some odd years." 
 
And I said, "Let me tell you something, Lou."  I said, "If I have one 
wish when O.J. and Nicole was together, I wish" -- I mean, when 
they got divorced, I wished they could have gotten back together 
and lived happily ever after, but it wasn't happening.  And Nicole 
would tell you that I never sided with O.J.  If O.J. was wrong, he 
was wrong.  I was always there for Nicole." 
 
He said, "Well, Nicole did say that."  I said, "Make up your mind, 
Lou.  Either I was her friend or wasn't her friend."  So he says, 
"Well, O.J. controls you."  I said, "O.J. doesn't control me."  I said, 
"He is my friend, and we've been friends and we will continue on 
to be friends."  And he went into about -- what did he say after that 
-- about the evidence, the overwhelming evidence.  I said, "Lou, he 
went to trial.  He was found not guilty."  And Lou went into, 
"Well, the black" -- I said, "Why people don't want to listen to what 
the jury is saying"--  
 
Q: The "black" what?  I'm sorry? 
 
A: The black jurors.  Because O.J. got off because, I guess, the jury 
was black.  I said, "Nobody wants to listen to what they are saying 
after the trial." I said, "You been lied to, I been lied to by the 
authorities." 
 
And I said, you know -- he said something -- he went to the effect 
that 10 percent of the population or whatever hates O.J., or 
whatever. 
 
Q: 10 percent? 
 
A: That's what he -- I don't know.  Lou was going back and forth, 
and he expressed to me -- and I told him something that I had never 
told anybody, about what Nicole told me that night I took her to 
the hospital and --  
 
Q: What was that? 
 
A: About how she felt her family would side with O.J., and that 
disturbed her a great deal.  And when we went down to the 
hospital, I stood by her, and when the nurse asked her what had 
happened, Nicole looked at me, and I said, "Nicole, you got to tell 
them," and she told them that she was hit. 
 
Q: By? 
 
A: By O.J. I don't know if she said O.J., but she said she was hit.  
They asked her, "How did you sustain your injuries," or whatever, 
like that.  And she said, "I was hit." 
 
Q: Okay.  When you told Lou that the authorities had lied to you --  
 
A: No, not lied.  A lot of lies have been out about this whole thing 
that I know are lies, that the authorities or the press has been 
saying. 
 
Q: But specifically you had said before -- I can read it back to you. 
"I said, 'You been lied to, I been lied to by the authorities.'"  Do 
you remember just stating that? 
 
A: I stated that, but what I'm saying -- because I never spoke to the 
authorities myself.  It's just all the lies have come out about certain 
things that I know that's not true. 
 
Q: Such as? 
 
A: I can't go into it. 
 
Q: Why is that? 
 
A: We just talked about that.    
 
Q: Who just talked about it?    
 
A: My lawyer and I. 
 
MR. RE: I think what he is saying is there are lies about some of 
the events that involve him that have been misreported in the 
media which has to do with the area in which he is asserting the 
privilege. 
 
MR. KELLY: In what area again is he asserting the privilege? 
 
MR. RE: Same area we've been asserting it in the past. 
 
MR. KELLY: That two-week time frame there? 
 
MR. RE: Well, the time frame is basically from the point in time 
when Mr. Simpson returns to Los Angeles from Chicago until the 
time frame shortly after Mr. Cowlings' and Mr. Simpson's arrests 
after the Bronco ride, and then there are certain other potential 
subject matters that may come up after that period of time but on a 
subject matter basis. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Well, going to June 12th, which was before Mr. Simpson came 
back from Chicago, or early June 13th, is it your understanding, 
first of all, that that's when a lot of the evidence in that criminal 
case was gathered? 
 
A: I have no knowledge.  All I know, as time has -- as time since 
then, a lot of lies have been said pertaining to things that I know 
for a fact are not true. 
 
Q: And you can't state --  
 
A: I didn't state -- I did not state it to Lou.  I just told Lou that.  And 
Lou proceeded to talk to me about him not being a good father, and 
I told him that he did the best that he could. There's not a book in 
the library that says this is how to be a great father.  You do the 
best you can, and after your kids get to a certain age, you keep your 
fingers crossed. 
 
We talked about O.J. not being a father.  I said, "Why don't you 
give him that opportunity?"  It was...He said to me -- and then I 
criticized him for allowing you lawyers to go on TV to --  
 
Q: You criticized Lou? 
 
A: -- Lou to let his lawyers go on TV claiming that I was hiding out 
and I didn't want to be served with a paper.  I said that was an 
outright lie, because the Browns has got all the numbers on me, has 
always been able to get in touch with me for any reason, to do 
something for the kids, to do something for them.  They about the 
only people that got numbers -- direct numbers to me. 
 
Q: Do you know who the Browns' attorney is? 
 
A: Well, now I know you are.  All I know is he (Indicating) stood 
on TV and made like I was hiding out somewhere, which was a lie.  
I mean, the Browns knew where I worked.  I had brought dresses 
down there to Sydney.  They got labels that list the address -- I 
mean the company I work for. 
 
If you two was communicating, all you had to say, "Where does he 
work?"  They would have gave you the phone number, because for 
certain -- you guys went way out to Public Storage.  I haven's 
worked out there in years. 
 
Q: What else have you discussed with Lou or Judy? 
 
A: No, Judy -- Judy -- everyone else is -- I don't see Justy play 
basketball.  Nobody knows what's going on outside.  I'm sitting out 
there yelling -- yelling and Lou yelling at me. 
 
Q: So this is just you and Lou at this point? 
 
A: Just you and -- just me and Lou outside.  Everybody else is 
watching Justy play basketball. 
 
Q: Anything else in the conversation? 
 
A: He expressed that he did not want Nicole to date O.J.  I said, 
"Why didn't you say something then?" 
 
He expressed that he did not want Nicole to marry O.J.  I said, 
"Why didn't you say something then, Lou?" 
 
Q: Did he say why he didn't want Nicole --  
 
A: He never did. He never did. 
 
Q: Anything- 
 
A: I think -- you know, why he was unloading on me.  I have no 
idea.  Even with that.  I mean, I never questioned him being a 
father.  I never questioned the fact that O.J. and Nicole got married.  
They were very happy.  Everybody seems to be -- the families got 
along great together.  O.J. was very good to the family.  They were 
very good to him.  It was one big happy family. 
 
Q: Did Lou seem upset during this conversation? 
 
A: I'm quite sure he was bothered with it.  I'm quite sure Lou is 
bothered deeply. 
 
Q: Would you be bothered if your daughter was murdered? 
 
A: Yes, I would be bothered. 
 
Q: Do you recall at any time being at Rockingham when Nicole, 
her mother Judy and Dominique were going to a show Disney On 
Ice with Sydney? 
 
A: I don't know.  They did a lot of things.   I can't pinpoint, you 
know, where they were going. 
 
MR. KELLY: Could we just take a break for a minute?  I want to 
look at some exhibits, and then we will keep going.  Five minutes? 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the 
time is approximately 3:37. 
 
(Recess.) 
 
(Fred Goldman enters the deposition.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 3:52. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Mr. Cowlings --  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- the last couple minutes I believe you had the opportunity to 
look at this particular exhibit I am showing you? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: And that's previously been marked as Exhibit No. 87. 
 
First of all, did Nicole ever send you letters, cards? 
 
A: Birthday cards, she would.  After her and O.J. divorced, my 
apartment on San Vicente wasn't too far from Sydney's school, and 
every once in a while they would leave notes on my car, but that 
was about the extent of it. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did Nicole used to leave like notes on the refrigerator of 
things that had to be done? 
 
A: If they went out of town like on a vacation or something like 
that, she would leave instructions on how to feed the dogs or how 
to feed the cats.  If she had -- of course. when she was doing her 
interior decorating business, if there were some items to be picked 
up, some fabric or a chair or something like that, she'll leave the 
address or the phone number. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recognize that handwriting on Exhibit No. 87 
I've given you? 
 
A: Yes, I do. 
 
Q: And whose handwriting do you --  
 
A: Seems to be Nicole's handwriting. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall -- let me take this for a minute -- a time in 
January of 1988 where you were over at Rockingham with Mr. 
Simpson, and Nicole and her mother Judy and Dominique came 
back from a show with Sydney? 
 
A: I don't remember that.  There's been a number of occasions 
where I've been at their company at the house.  I couldn't pinpoint 
a day or a time. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you remember a time when they showed up that you 
kissed Nicole, her mother and Minnie, but Simpson did not? 
 
A: I don't remember that. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall drinking over there at any time in January 
of 1988 with Simpson? 
 
A: I've drank there.  I couldn't tell you the exact day or month or 
year, but I've drank there quite a few times. 
 
Q: Do you remember drinking there on some afternoon prior to 
Nicole, her mother and Dominique arriving back at the premises? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you remember any occasion when Simpson started 
screaming at Nicole, and you had to grab Sydney and get out of 
there? 
 
A: What I stated earlier about what happened at the pool is the only 
time I ever grabbed Sydney and took her away. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall ever hearing Simpson call Nicole a fat 
pig? 
 
A: Not that I remember. 
 
Q: Do you recall specifically in January of 1988 Simpson saying to 
Nicole in front of you, "You're a fat pig"? 
 
A: Not that I can remember. 
 
Q: Do you recall ever hearing him say to Nicole in front of you at 
Rockingham, "You're disgusting.  You're a slob.  I want you out of 
my F**king house"? 
 
A: I've never heard them -- those words come out of O.J.'s mouth. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you remember Nicole trying to take Sydney and get 
away from Simpson as he said these things to Nicole? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall Simpson ever saying to you in front of 
Nicole, "My wife's a fat ass liar. I stopped F**king other girls, and 
now I jack off, the fat ass"? 
 
A: No, I do not remember him saying that to me. 
 
Q: Did Simpson ever say anything like that to you, ever? 
 
A: Over the years he has expressed that he was going to change his 
ways and, you know, be more, you know, honest with Nicole, be 
more loyal o her, but he's never in those terms told me what him 
and Nicole was doing in the bedroom or what actions they were 
doing. 
 
Q: Did you ever hear Simpson yell at Nicole in January of 1988, 
"Get out of my F**king house, you fat ass liar"? 
 
A: No, I don't remember that. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall in January of 1988 Nicole ever having to 
leave the house with Sydney, packing some things and to leave? 
 
A: No, I don't. 
 
Q: Do you recall ever hearing Simpson say to Nicole while you 
were in the house at Rockingham, "Let me tell you how serious I 
am.  I have a gun in my hand right now. Get the F**k out of here"? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And were you ever there when Nicole had to take Sydney and 
the cats and a bag and a bottle and leave the house at Rockingham? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  And this three-page exhibit, Exhibit 87 that I asked you 
to read before --  
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: -- is it your testimony here today that none of these events 
referred to in this later here ever occurred? 
 
A: No, no.  I don't know if things have been misplaced.  All I know 
is when Nicole and O.J. were arguing at the pool, I picked Sydney 
up and took her into the house. 
 
Q: I am not talking about --  
 
A: Okay.  That's -- that's -- that's the only thing I know of being in 
their company when an argument started between the two of them 
and I was present.  That's -- you know, that's when I picked up 
Sydney and went in the house.  That I have no knowledge of. 
 
Q: None whatsoever. 
 
A: None whatsoever. 
 
Q: Okay. Can you tell me of any reason that you know of that 
Nicole would make up those things that are written on those three 
pages? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did you ever discuss any incident similar to this, with Nicole? 
 
A: Have I discussed? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Incidents in here? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: No, uh-uh. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you know any reason why Nicole would use your 
name if it wasn't true? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I have no knowledge of it. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  If Judy Brown were to testify to the events referred to in 
this letter, would she not be telling the truth? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  It's an improper question. 
 
A: I have no knowledge of this.  Like I say, I don't remember this. 
 
Q: At all. 
 
A: At all. 
 
Q: You had mentioned earlier some incident that occurred in 
Hawaii? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And was that over Christmas in 1988? 
 
A: I believe it was '88.  It was at Christmastime.  I don't know the 
exact date -- I mean the exact year. 
 
Q: Well, let me ask you: You have a vivid recollection of New 
Year's Day 1989 when you took Nicole to the hospital, do you not? 
 
A: From when I was there that night -- 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: -- yes, uh-huh. 
 
Q: Okay.  And would it be fair to say that your trip to Hawaii was 
just prior to that incident? 
 
A: Prior? What do you mean by "prior"? 
 
Q: Yeah, like the week before.  Hadn't you just gotten back from 
Hawaii when the New Year's Day incident occurred? 
 
A: I've never really -- I never put the two of them together.  I know 
we all went to Hawaii. If it was '88 or '89, I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay.  Who did you go to Hawaii with? 
 
A: O.J. and his family.  When I say "his  family,. Nicole, Arnelle, 
Sydney, and I think Justy was a baby, the Browns -- 
 
Q: Which Browns? 
 
A: Lou, Judy, Dominique -- was Dominique...I think [Name 
Deleted] was there.  Denise was there with Sean, her son.  Tom 
McCullum and his girlfriend; I don't know her name, and --  
 
Q: Was Denise there? 
 
A: Pardon? 
 
Q: Denise? 
 
A: Yes, Denise was there with Sean, her son. 
 
Q: Okay.  And who planned this vacation? 
 
A: I assume the Browns and O.J. 
 
Q: Okay.  And do you know who paid for it? 
 
A: That I don't know. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you pay for any of it? 
 
A: I paid -- O.J. refused to take my money at the airport, and so... 
 
Q: So he paid for it. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you know the name of the hotel you stayed at when 
you were down there? 
 
A: It was a West -- was it Western?    
 
Q: I'm asking you, Mr. Cowlings. 
 
A: I think it's a Western.  It's a big hotel right next to the airport on 
one of the islands. 
 
Q: Okay.  And did everybody stay at that same hotel that you 
mentioned before? 
 
A: Yes.  Yes. 
 
Q: Do you recall how long you went to Hawaii for? 
 
A: I think we were there for a week, maybe longer. 
 
Q: Were you there for Christmas Day? 
 
A: Could have.  Probably. I don't know. 
 
Q: Okay.  Were you back before New Year's Day? 
 
A: I don't know that either. 
 
Q: You don't play golf, by the way, do you, Mr. Cowlings? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What would you do during the day when you were there in 
Hawaii? 
 
A: Play tennis. 
 
Q: Who would you play with? 
 
A: Anybody up at the tennis facility.  They would line games up 
for me. 
 
Q: What would Simpson do during the days? 
 
A: I assume he was playing golf.  
 
Q: Every day? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Did you spend much time with Nicole, Sydney and Justin when 
he was playing golf? 
 
A: No. Everybody -- the girls --  when I say "the girls," all of them 
would go to the beach; I would either be at the courts, the tennis 
courts, or I'd be in the gym; O.J. and Tom McCullum would be off 
playing golf somewhere, and later on we all would meet at the little 
pool area there and have, you know, drinks, mai tais, whatever, you 
know, beach drinks. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was there any day there that Simpson and McCullum 
didn't go off and play golf? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Do you recall any argument between Nicole and O.J. during this 
vacation? 
 
A: It was more of a comment that she made. It didn't -- I don't think 
it ever developed into a -- I mean, like I say, in my presence it 
wasn't an argument. 
 
Q: Can you tell me what happened? 
 
A: Nicole supposedly had made a comment in reference to O.J.'s 
father to -- we were all sitting in a large dining room --  
 
Q: Do you know where you were, first of all? 
 
A: We were at a restaurant. 
 
Q: Do you know the name of it? 
 
A: You mentioned it earlier. 
 
Q: Charo's? 
 
A: I guess that's it. 
 
Q: Okay.  Does that name sound familiar? 
 
A: Yeah, if that's it. 
 
Q: Okay. First of all, who was there at the restaurant with you? 
 
A: All of us, the whole group. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was this for lunch or dinner? 
 
A: I would say lunch.  I think we were just driving out there to see 
the place and to have lunch out there. 
 
Q: Okay.  Would it be fair to say that Simpson had not played golf 
on this particular day? 
 
A: I don't know if they played in the morning or whatever I really 
don't know. 
   
Q: Okay. So tell me about what happened at the restaurant. 
 
A: We were all sitting around, you know, talking, you know, 
enjoying that particular day--  
 
Q: Was anybody drinking?   
 
A: I really don't know. When you say "drinking"-- 
 
Q: Alcohol? 
 
A: That I don't know. 
 
Q: Do you know if Simpson was drinking that day? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Do you know if Nicole was drinking that day? 
 
A: Don't remember. 
  
Q: What, if anything, happened while you were there in the 
restaurant? 
 
A: We were there.  There was two gentlemen sitting at a smaller 
table directly about ahead of this long table that all of us were 
sitting at, and I think Sydney -- Nicole got up with the baby -- I 
don't know if the baby was crying or kinda like being restless --  
 
Q: This is Justin you're speaking of? 
 
A: I guess. Anyway, one of the gentlemen made a comment how 
cute the baby was, and, I mean, Nicole responded, you know, 
accepted the compliment, accepted it --  
 
Q: Did you hear the comment? 
   
A: I didn't hear the comment.  I had gotten up and went into the -- 
the little card shop or --  
 
Q: Gift shop? 
 
A: Gift shop. Next thing I knew, Arnelle came in there and said, 
"We going.  Daddy is going." 
 
Q: I am sorry.  Were Arnelle and Jason on this trip? 
 
A: Arnelle was.  Jason wasn't. 
 
Q: Was there anybody there with Arnelle?  Did she have a 
boyfriend with her? 
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Okay.  I'm sorry. 
 
A: If [Name Deleted] was there, I think her and [Name Deleted] 
hung out.  So I said, "What's wrong?"  She said, "Dad said to come 
on." 
 
Q: "Dad" --  
 
A: "Dad said to come on." 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: So when I got to the car, O.J. had a straight face on.  I said, 
"What's wrong?"  And he says, "I'm not going to take that.  I said, 
"What happened?"  And he told me that Nicole -- after Nicole had 
let the man hold the baby, after -- no --  she took the baby back, O.J. 
supposedly had said, you know, "Why did you have that gay guy to 
hold my baby?" or something like that.  And she says, "Why you 
concerned about him being gay? Your father is gay." and O.J. got 
very upset with it, and he told me in the car --  
 
Q: Was this whole conversation taking place in the car? 
 
A: When he told me?    
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was anybody else in the car with you? 
 
A: I think Arnelle was. 
 
Q: Anybody else? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was Denise in that car? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Definitely not? 
 
A: Not that I remember. 
 
Q: You're sure she wasn't in the car? 
 
A: All I remember, Arnelle came in and got me from the little card 
shop.  When I got in the car, O.J. -- I asked him what was wrong, 
and he told me, and he was going to fly off the island that night.  
He said, "I'm outta here."  He said, "The rooms and everything are 
taken care of, no problem, but I'm not going to take that." 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you hear anything Nicole said to Simpson during 
this time period at the restaurant? 
 
A: I don't know what went down once they got back to the hotel. 
 
Q: But in the -- at the restaurant still, did you hear Nicole say 
anything after you came out of the gift shop? 
 
A: I don't remember.  I don't know if she tried to stop him or -- I 
really don't know. 
 
Q: Did you even see her at all when you came out of the gift shop? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Who drove back to the hotel with you and Simpson in the car? 
 
A: I think it was Arnelle and myself and O.J. 
 
Q: Do you know how long a drive it was back to the hotel? 
 
A: I don't know how long it takes to get back. 
 
Q: Was it more than 10 minutes?    
 
A: I really don't know. 
 
Q: More than 20 minutes?    
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall any other conversation in the car? 
 
A: It was pretty quiet going back.    
 
Q: Any discussion at all? 
 
A: He expressed that he was going to leave.  He was going to catch 
the next available flight and fly back to California. 
 
Q: Okay. Was it your impression he was angry the entire drive 
back to the hotel? 
 
A: Pardon? 
 
Q: Was it your impression that: Simpson was angry the entire time 
back to the hotel? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I would say he was upset. 
 
BY MR.KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  And very quiet? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  What, if anything, did he -- Let me ask you, first of all, 
when you got back to the hotel, did you meet up with anybody else 
there? 
 
A: I think I went to my room. 
 
Q: Did you see anybody when you pulled into the parking lot of 
that hotel? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did you see the Browns? 
 
A: Don't remember. 
 
Q: Did you see Nicole? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did you see Simpson after you got out of the car, at all? 
 
A: I went to my room.  I assumed that he was gonna make plans to 
fly out of there. 
 
Q: And when was the next time you spoke to Simpson? 
 
A: I think we all ended up going out that night. 
 
Q: Did you speak to Simpson again about what had happened that 
day? 
 
A: No, I didn't.  It seemed like it was -- they were together.  It 
seemed like it was over with, you know. 
 
Q: Did you discuss with Nicole at all --  
 
A: Nope.    
 
Q: -- that night? 
 
A: No, I didn't. 
 
Q: Do you recall what Nicole's mood was like that night when you 
went out to dinner? 
 
A: Seemed like they were -- you know, they were sitting together.  
Seemed like I guess whatever differences they had, they patched it 
up or came to --  
 
Q: Did they appear to be friendly towards one another again? 
 
A: Seems to be.  They were sitting together. 
 
Q: Were they talking together? 
 
A: I guess.  I didn't know if they were -- I wasn't sitting close 
enough to see if there was continuous conversation between the 
two of them. 
 
Q: Do you recall when you did leave Hawaii then after this 
incident? 
 
A: When we came back to LA.? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Yeah.  The vacation was over. 
 
Q: How long after this incident was the vacation over? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Was it the next day? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Okay.  When I believe Simpson had told you he was out of 
there he said -- 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: -- did he leave early? 
 
A: No.  We all flew back together. 
 
Q: Okay.  So the plans weren't changed at all? 
 
A: No.  Whatever went down that day, that night we were all 
together, so I guess they patched it up or put it aside. 
 
Q: Okay.  And you never saw any physical altercation between 
Nicole and Simpson regarding this incident? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And Simpson never told you after the fact that he had had any 
physical altercation with Nicole after he got back to the hotel? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And did Nicole ever tell you that she had had any physical 
confrontation with Simpson after she got back to the hotel --  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- that day?  Okay.  I was going to break here now, if it's all right 
with you guys.

A: Day, yes. 
 
Q: D-a-y? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
MS. ROIT: Yes? 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Mr. Cowlings, after l985, after Nicole and Mr. Simpson got 
married, did you ever observe Mr. Simpson using cocaine? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Could you tell me the last time prior to his arrest in June of 
1994 that you saw him use cocaine? 
 
A: Probably since '85. 
 
Q: Straight through? 
 
A: Last time I saw him?  
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Probably at one time I saw him in '85 was the last time I saw 
him do cocaine. 
 
Q: There was no time after 1985 you saw him use cocaine? 
 
A: Not to my knowledge, no.  Not in front of me. 
 
Q: Okay. Did he ever use marijuana in front of you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. After '85 did he ever indicate to you that he had been 
using cocaine? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever observe any indications in Mr. Simpson's 
appearance or demeanor that indicated to you that he had been 
using cocaine? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Not to my knowledge. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Yesterday you had answered some questions regarding a 
conversation you had had with Marcus Allen at Wayne Hughes' 
estate. 
 
Do you recall that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And I believe you had said that you told Mr. Allen that you 
knew about his affair with Nicole.  Is that correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Could you tell me, how did you know that he was having an 
affair with Nicole? 
 
MR. RE: He is going to assert a privilege as to that. 
 
MR. KELLY: On what basis, Mr. Re? 
 
MR. RE: Self-incrimination. 
 
MR. KELLY: Mr. Cowlings' self-incrimination? 
 
MR. RE: Mr. Cowlings is asserting a privilege against self-
incrimination. 
 
MR. KELLY: I am asking him questions regarding Mr. Allen et 
this point, Mr. Re. 
 
MR. RE: Mr. Cowlings is asserting a privilege against self-
incrimination. 
 
MR. KELLY: I would like to know the basis for that. As far as I 
know, the only thing he was ever under investigation for was facts 
and circumstances refuting to his flight on June 17th, 1994. I 
would like to know how he is asserting a privilege regarding 
knowledge of Mr. Allen's activities prior to June 12th of 1994. 
 
MR. RE: You are not entitled to know. 
 
MR. KELLY: I think we need a record if we are going to go into 
court on this, Mr. Re. 
 
MR. RE: The record is he is asserting a privilege against self-
incrimination based upon the standards we announced to you 
yesterday, period.  That's all you are entitled to know. 
 
MR. KELLY: The standard you announced yesterday was that you 
were not going to answer questions regarding any activities 
covering the dates from June 17th to approximately two dates 
thereafter. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Two dates? 
 
MR. KELLY: Two weeks thereafter. 
 
MR. RE: Actually, we limited it to shorter than two weeks, 
actually until the time of his arrest, which I guess is approximately 
a period of one week, but he is asserting a privilege against self-
incrimination. 
 
MR. KELLY: Could you read back that last question again for me, 
sir. 
 
(Pending question read as follows: 
 
Q: Could you tell me, how did you know that he was having an 
affair with Nicole? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Mr. Cowlings, did you learn in the period -- or first learn in the 
period between June 17th and approximately June 13th and 
approximately two weeks after that June 13th date that Marcus 
Allen and Nicole had been having an affair? 
 
MR. RE: He is asserting a privilege against self-incrimination. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Mr. Cowlings, did you know prior to June 12th, 1994 that 
Marcus Allen was having an affair with Nicole Brown Simpson? 
 
MR. RE: You can answer. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did you know subsequent to approximately -- or subsequent to 
July 1st, 1994, did you have any conversations with anybody 
regarding Marcus Allen's relationship with Nicole Brown 
Simpson? 
 
MR. RE: Other than Marcus Allen? 
 
MR. KELLY: Other than Marcus Allen. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: And who was that?  
 
A: Cora Fischman. 
 
Q: And when did you have this conversation with Cora Fischman?  
 
A: The day that her and I met.  
 
Q: That was when you called her and arranged that meeting? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And could you tell me what she told you about the relationship 
between Marcus Allen and Nicole? 
 
A: She said they were friends. 
 
Q: That's all she said? 
 
A: She said they were friends. 
 
Q: Did she say anything about those two having an affair, meaning 
Marcus Allen and Nicole? 
 
A: She didn't go into detail. She --   
 
Q: Did she --  
 
A: She didn't want to talk about it. 
 
Q: Did you ask her about it? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Did you press her on it? 
 
A: No.  When she said she didn't want to talk about it, I didn't press 
any more. 
 
Q: Did she indicate at all they had any sort of romantic 
relationship? 
 
A: She didn't mention it to me. 
 
Q: Mr. Cowlings, did you learn for the first time after July 1st, 
1994 that Marcus Allen had been having an affair with Nicole 
Brown Simpson? 
 
MR. RE: I am going to have to object to it but if you would 
slightly rephrase the question, I wouldn't have a problem with it.  If 
you would simply ask if he learned -- 
 
MR. KELLY: For the first time? 
 
MR. RE: No. For the first time is what  bothers me.  I mean, if he 
received information after that date about the affair, I have no 
problem with him answering that question. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Mr. Cowlings, did you receive any information after July 
1st, 1994 that Marcus Allen was having an affair with Nicole 
Brown Simpson? 
 
A: You said after July 1st? 
 
Q: Yes.

regarding Marcus Allen having an affair with Nicole Brown 
Simpson? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Did you receive any information at all prior to June 12th, 1994 
that Marcus Allen was having an affair with Nicole Brown 
Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you have any conversations with Marcus Allen after 
July 1st, 1994 regarding his relationship with Nicole Brown 
Simpson? 
 
A: Explain.  Are you asking me another conversation, or are you 
speaking about the first conversation? 
 
Q: Any conversations other than the one you've already testified to, 
at Wayne Hughes' place. 
 
A: Pertaining to? 
 
Q: Marcus Allen's relationship with Nicole Brown Simpson. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you have any conversations with Marcus Allen regarding 
Mr. Simpson's possible involvement in Nicole's murder, after July 
1st, 1994? 
 
A: Not involvement.  We spoke about how bad the situation -- how 
bad it is. 
 
Q: And what was bad about it? 
 
A: Our best friend is accused of murder and our other friend who's 
dead.  
 
Q: Did you have any discussion as to the evidence that had 
emerged against Mr. Simpson? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague as to "evidence." 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: None? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you have any discussions that day with Wayne 
Hughes regarding Nicole Brown Simpson? 
 
A: After what day? 
 
Q: On the day you were up at Wayne Hughes' estate. 
 
A: What day is that? 
 
Q: The day you had the conversation with Marcus Allen also. 
 
A: About what? 
 
Q: About Nicole. 
 
A: That we -- you know, it was a dreadful situation.  Everybody 
was bothered by all this. 
 
Q: Was there anything in particular that Mr. Hughes was bothered 
by with the situation? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: What in particular? 
 
A: Nicole is dead and O.J.'s in jail. 
 
Q: Did he indicate in any way he was upset with things that were 
being said about Nicole Brown Simpson? 
 
A: We all were. 
 
Q: What had you heard that you were upset about? 
 
A: Just how the media has just pounded on this stuff, and it was 
just, you know, someone like -- We all knew Nicole, and to have 
things in the press, you know, I don't know how true or whatever it 
is, but you feel for her. 
 
Q: Well, what were the things in the press that you heard about 
Nicole that you felt for? 
 
A: Probably most damaging was Faye Resnick's book. 
 
Q: Well, that didn't come out for months later, did it? 
 
A: Yeah, but that's the only thing I can remember. 
 
Q: Okay. What about prior to that? I am asking you now when you 
are talking to Mr. Hughes at his estate. 
 
A: We just talked about, you know, how awful a situation it is. 
 
Q: Do you remember hearing reports of Nicole's drug use? 
 
MR. RE: At that time, you mean? 
 
BY MR. KELLY:  
 
Q: At that time. 
 
A: I don't know. I don't remember.  
 
Q: Have you heard subsequent to that time reports of Nicole's 
using drugs? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: You ever seen her use drugs? 
 
A: Who? Nicole? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Could you tell me any other concerns you heard about in 
the media that were upsetting you? 
 
A: How -- there were a couple, I guess, tabloids that doctor up 
pictures. I guess she made a trip to Cabo, and how they trying to 
make it perceived that she was just a very wild person. 
 
Q: Was she? 
 
A: Not to my knowledge. 
 
Q: Okay.  When did you see Nicole use drugs? 
 
A: Around the same time that I saw O.J.: In '85. 
 
Q: 1985? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And you were still as good a friend with Mr. Simpson in 1994 
as you were in 1985, were you not? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And just as close to him?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you were just as close to Nicole in 1994, if not closer, than 
you were in 1985? 
 
A: Yeah, we were close. 
 
Q: Spent a lot of time with her? 
 
A: No, I didn't spend a lot of time but, you know, I would go by 
and see them, you know, see the kids. 
 
Q: Okay. And you'd visit with her? 
 
A: Yeah, go over and take the kids to breakfast in the mornings 
sometime. 
 
Q: In the two years prior to 1994, did you ever see Nicole use any 
drugs? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you see -- did you hear any stories of her acting wild 
in any way? 
 
A: Are you speaking of when she was divorced? 
 
Q: Yeah. That you knew of. 
 
A: I would see her out. 
 
Q: Dancing? 
 
A: At restaurants. 
 
Q: Where did you see her? 
 
A: The Monkey Bar. 
 
Q: How many times did you see her there? 
 
A: Two or three times. 
 
Q: And who were you there with? 
 
A: With friends or went in there by myself. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall who she was with first time you saw her 
there at the Monkey Bar? 
 
A: I think it was Cici and Faye. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What's the time frame here? You said two 
years before '94. 
 
MR. KELLY: Right. 
 
Q: This is after the divorce? 
 
A: This is after the divorce. 
 
Q: Okay. After October l992?  
 
A: I'd been by her house a few times for little parties that she had 
given at her condo. 
 
Q: Well, putting that aside for a minute, the parties at the condo, 
could you tell me approximately the first time you saw Nicole out 
at the Monkey Bar? 
 
A: I couldn't put a date on it. 
 
Q: Was it after her divorce from Mr. Simpson in 1992? 
 
A: I don't know if the divorce was final.  I mean, she had moved 
out. 
 
Q: For all intents and purposes, the marriage was over at that 
point? 
 
A: Seems like it -- it seemed like it at that time, yes. 
 
Q: And who did you see Nicole with the first time you saw her at 
the Monkey Bar? 
 
A: Cici and Cora -- I mean Cici and Faye. 
 
Q: Okay. Not Cora? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you remember who else Nicole was there with? 
 
A: Some of the, I think, managers or employees of the Monkey 
Bar. 
 
Q: Do you know their names?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever learn their names afterwards? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know what time she left? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was her behavior wild or unacceptable to you? 
 
A: No. She was having fun, enjoying herself. 
 
Q: Just the way she always did?  
 
A: Seemed like it. 
 
Q: Okay. When was the next time you saw her, say, at the Monkey 
Bar?  
 
A: I don't know. Could have been a week, two weeks, three weeks. 
 
Q: After the first time you had seen her? 
 
A: Probably. 
 
Q: Okay. And who was she there with at that time? 
 
A: I think she was with Cici and Faye. 
 
Q: Okay.  And did you talk to her at that time? 
 
A: Uh-huh. Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. I am sorry. Who did you say you were with the first time 
you saw her at the Monkey Bar? 
 
A: I met friends there or I went there by myself. 
 
Q: Was Mr. Simpson there with you the first time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever call Mr. Simpson afterwards and tell him 
you had seen Nicole there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, the second time you saw he at the Monkey Bar, 
who else were you with? 
 
A: I don't know if I was by myself or met people there. The 
Monkey Bar was a very popular place, so there was people there 
that I knew, and I knew people was going to be there that I knew. 
 
Q: Was Mr. Simpson there the second time you saw Nicole there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you talk to her that night? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was she having a good time? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was she wild or out of control? 
 
A: Seemed like she was enjoying herself. 
 
Q: Okay. Dancing? 
 
A: There's no dancing in the restaurant. 
 
Q: Okay. At the Monkey Bar? 
 
A: At the Monkey Bar. 
 
Q: Okay. And as far as you could tell, she was just there with Cici 
and Faye? 
 
A: Yeah. They were enjoying themselves. 
 
Q: Okay. Anybody else at the table, any dates or anything? 
 
A: Could have been guys coming and going, sitting down, talking 
to them. 
 
Q: By the way, did you see Nicole leave the first time she -- you 
saw her at the Monkey Bar? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you see her leave the second time she was at the Monkey 
Bar? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. And after this second time you saw her, did you see her a 
the time at the Monkey Bar? 
 
A: I think so. 
 
Q: And how long after that second time did you see her? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Do you recall who she was with? 
 
A: Faye and Cici. 
 
Q: So each time you saw Nicole, she was with Faye and Cici? 
 
A: Well, she could have been with Faye this time. 
 
Q: Just Faye? 
 
A: I think. 
 
Q: Any men with them also? 
 
A: Could have been. 
 
Q: Were they seated having dinner or at the bar? 
 
A: They were seated at a table in the dining room. 
 
Q: Just the two of them? 
 
A: Like I said, people were coming over, saying hello to them or 
speaking to them. 
 
Q: Okay.  They weren't up at the bar, though? 
 
A: Not the three times that I was there.  They always had a table? 
 
Q: Okay. Could you tell me what time of night this was you saw 
them at the table? 
 
MR. LEONARD: At which occasion? 
 
MR. KELLY: All three occasions. 
 
Q: If you could tell me. 
 
A: I couldn't give you a definite time. It was at night. 
 
Q: Was it after midnight the first time? 
 
A: I really don't know. 
 
Q: Was it after midnight the second time? 
 
A: I really don't know. 
 
Q: Was it after midnight the third time? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: And was it your impression each time that they were there 
seated having dinner? 
 
A: They would be drinking their champagne and eating their 
caviar. 
 
Q: Okay. Did Simpson ever tell you he thought Nicole was 
unfaithful to him during their marriage? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Nicole ever tell you that she was unfaithful to Mr. Simpson 
during their marriage? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Did Nicole ever even show any interest in any other man 
that you saw during her marriage to Mr. Simpson? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Vague, showing interest. 
 
THE WITNESS: Interest in how? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Just being flirtatious at all? 
 
A: No, not to my knowledge. 
 
Q: Okay. Would it be fair to say that Nicole was during their 
marriage completely dedicated to Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: Yes, I would say that, yes. 
 
Q: Devoted to him? 
 
A: Yes, very much so. 
 
Q: Okay. Would it be fair to say also that Nicole would always put 
Simpson's interests before hers during their marriage? 
 
A: I would say the two of them did.  They best -- you know, he was 
concerned about her and she was concerned about him. 
 
Q: And she would usually put Simpson's career interests before 
hers during the marriage also? 
 
A: When you say "interests" what are you speaking about? 
 
Q: Well, professional interests.  Like that she knew he had to go 
live in New York, and she would make that sacrifice because that 
was part of his career during their marriage? 
 
A: She enjoyed it, too. 
 
Q: Yeah. Okay. And would it be fair to say that Nicole would also 
put Sydney and Justin's interests before her own? 
 
A: It was her children.  She was very close to them. 
 
Q: Okay.  And as we sit here today, can you tell me whether Nicole 
was anything besides a devoted, loving, selfless wife to Mr. 
Simpson? 
 
A: She was a great person. 
 
Q: And as we sit here today, can you tell me if Nicole was 
anything other than a devoted, loving, selfless mother to Sydney 
and Nicole? 
 
A: She was a great mother. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you miss Nicole? 
 
A: Yes, I do. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you think Sydney and Justin miss her? 
 
A: I'm quite sure they do. 
 
Q: Do you think the Browns miss her? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do her friends miss her? 
 
A: I would think so. 
 
Q: Okay. Was her murder a great loss? 
 
A: It was a great loss. 
 
Q: Yesterday we had been discussing an incident in Hawaii during 
Christmas of 1988. 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: When you came back from Hawaii, could you tell me the next 
time that you saw Nicole? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay. Was that at the end of December 1988, that you came 
back from Hawaii? 
 
A: I don't know if we stayed for New Year's or came back.  I really 
don't know.  That was a long time ago. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you remember whether you saw Nicole on New 
Year's Eve of 1988? 
 
A: No, I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall the incident where you took Nicole to the 
hospital on New Year's Day? 
 
A: What year? 
 
Q: 1989. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And that would have been January 1st, 1989? 
 
A: That night, January 1st, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, was that in fact a couple days after you had just 
gotten back from Hawaii? 
 
A: I don't know when I went -- I don't know if it was in '88 or '89.  I 
don't remember when I was in Hawaii. 
 
Q: Can you make any association between the Hawaiian trip and 
when you took Nicole to the hospital? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You don't recall that just being a couple days after you had 
gotten back from Hawaii? 
 
A: No, I don't. 
 
Q: Okay. Are you certain that it wasn't a couple days after you had 
gotten back from Hawaii that you took Nicole to the hospital? 
 
A: Pardon? 
 
Q: Are you certain that it was not just couple days later, after you 
had gotten back from Hawaii, that you took Nicole to the hospital? 
 
A: I don't understand the question. You're saying what? 
 
MR. KELLY: I am sorry. Can you read the last question back 
again, please. 
 
(Pending question read as follows: "Q: Are you certain that it was 
not just a couple days later, after you had gotten back from Hawaii, 
that you took Nicole to the hospital?") 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember. Like I said, I don't -- I know we 
all went -- it could have been '87; could have been '88; it could 
have been '89, for all I know.  I don't remember the trip, putting it 
together with the night I took her to the hospital. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: No association between the two.  
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay. Looking back from New Year's Day evening when you 
took Nicole to the hospital, had you seen Nicole at all the day 
before, on New Year's Eve? 
 
A: Yes, I did. 
 
Q: And where did you see her? 
 
A: We were all at a parry for New Year's Eve. 
 
Q: And where was that party?  
 
A: It was in Santa Monica. 
 
Q: Was it a restaurant or someone's house? 
 
A: No, it was a house party. 
 
Q: Whose party was it? 
 
A: A gentleman by the name of [Name Deleted] and his wife 
[Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: Was this an annual party you used to attend? 
 
A: I don't know if he has it every year, but he -- I was invited and 
the Simpsons were invited. 
 
Q: Okay. Could you tell me how many people were there at this 
party total? 
 
A: Quite a few. 
 
Q: More than a hundred? 
 
A: Seemed like it. The house was crowded. 
 
Q: Okay. Was this black tie or... 
 
A: No. You know, sport coat, suit. 
 
Q: And did you have a date that night? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: And who were you with?  
 
A: That I cannot remember.  
 
Q: Given time, do you think you might? 
 
A: No, I know I wouldn't remember that one.  I'm better with faces 
than names. 
 
Q: I'd ask you to describe her, but I don't think it's necessary. 
 
A: Knowing you, you probably would. 
 
Q: I might. I might get back to it.  And you saw Mr. Simpson that 
night also? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was this a dinner party or just drinks and appetizers? 
 
A: I don't know if it was finger food or buffet. It was food there. 
 
Q: Okay. And this went till after midnight?  It was an actual New 
Year's Eve party? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And were you there till after midnight? 
 
A: Yes, because when midnight came, everybody -- you know, you 
embraced your date or your wife or whoever you was with and 
kissed and brought in the new year. 
 
Q: You can't think of the name of that person you embraced and 
kissed? 
 
A: No, uh-uh. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Assumes a fact not in evidence. 
 
MR. KELLY: He was speaking generally.  I assumed he did what 
everybody else did that night. 
 
Q: Did the Simpsons stay till after midnight, as far as you know? 
 
A: As far as I know, yes. 
 
Q: Do you recall speaking to them after midnight on that night? 
 
A: Yeah, we all hugged and embraced each other. 
 
Q: Do you know whether Mr. Simpson was drinking that night? 
 
A: I know I was drinking. I don't know you know, I guess 
everybody had a drink of some kind. 
 
Q: Do you recall Mr. Simpson appearing intoxicated to you at all? 
 
A: Didn't seem to be. 
 
Q: Okay. What about Nicole, did she appear to be intoxicated to 
you? 
 
A: Seemed to be fine. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall them leaving that night? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Do you remember saying good-bye to them.? 
 
A: I don't know if I left before them or they left before me. 
 
Q: Okay.  Could you tell me, after that night, when was the next 
time you spoke to Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: Would have been that morning. 
 
Q: Do you recall what time? 
 
A: I was woken up by a phone call from Michelle, the maid. 
 
Q: Simpson's housekeeper? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And what time was that at? 
 
A: I was in a dead sleep, so I probably was out for a number of 
hours, I don't know, two or three hours or so. I don't know. 
 
Q: Was it about 3:30 or 4:00 a.m. in the morning, do you recall? 
 
A: It could have been. 
 
Q: Okay. Could you tell me exactly what Michelle said to you at 
that time? 
 
A: She was somewhat upset.  You know, I couldn't make heads or 
tails because I'm coming out of a sleep and I'm trying to make -- get 
my own thinking process going, and finally I got her to slow down, 
and -- I don't know -- she said something about come up there, 
something was going on. I don't know if she said, "O.J. and Nicole 
are fighting," or something like that. 
 
Q: Could you tell me specifically what she said to you? 
 
A: I couldn't tell you specifically because I don't remember exactly 
the words she said. 
 
Q: Okay. Well, how long were you on the phone with her for? 
 
A: Wasn't too long. I dropped the phone and jumped in my car and 
drove up there. 
 
Q: Right after she called you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And when you got there -- How far did you live from 
Rockingham at that time? 
 
A: Five minutes. I lived in [Address Deleted]. 
 
Q: Was it your impression in speaking to Michelle that Mr. 
Simpson and Nicole were in the middle of fighting when she called 
you? 
 
A: I don't know if they was in the middle or just started or finished. 
I had no idea. I just reacted. 
 
Q: And to the best of your recollection, all you remember is her 
saying that -- something about a fight? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Could you tell me, as best you can, what you think Michelle 
said to you? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know, sir. I told you as best as I can. I 
don't remember the exact words that she used, but, you know, like I 
said, that the two of them were fighting. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. And do you recall looking at your clock as you dropped 
the phone and got ready and scooted over there? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Do you recall what time it was when you got there? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Could you tell me what you observed when you arrived there? 
 
A: When I got there, I don't know if I pushed the phone outside or 
if I came in on the Rockingham side with my key.  I don't 
remember. 
 
Q: Do you remember where you parked? 
 
A: I think I parked outside, I think. 
 
Q: On Ashford or Rockingham? 
 
A: I don't remember. It could have been one -- I probably -- I'm not 
sure. I'm not sure. 
 
Q: Did you drive your white Ford Bronco over there? 
 
A: No. I didn't have that then. 
 
Q: What did you have? 
 
A: What did I have. I don't remember what car I had. 
 
Q: It wasn't the one you just had the lawsuit about that you were 
fighting -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- over, was it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You have no idea which car it was? 
 
A: No, I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay. All right. After you parked the car, could you tell me 
what happened next? 
 
A: I don't know if Nicole buzzed me in or Michelle buzzed me in 
or if I came through the gate.  I walked in.  I came into the kitchen.  
Nicole was by the sink, and she was upset, mad. 
 
Q: How did you know she was upset? 
 
A: Because I looked at her. 
 
Q: Was she crying? 
 
A: No, she wasn't crying. She was -- she was mad.  And I said, 
"Are you all right?" I don't know if she said -- I think she sweared a 
little bit.  And I was there for her, asked her if there was anything I 
could do. 
 
She said "No, I just want to be left alone," and I stood there, and 
she was just shaking her head, just pissed off, real pissed off. 
 
And then I heard a sound, and I walked from the kitchen to the 
dining room, and O.J. was standing there, and I said, "What are 
you doing?"  And he stepped into the light of between the doorway 
and the dining room and he said, "Nicole, can I talk to you?" and 
she picked up the phone to call the cops again. No. She picked up -- 
when I was there, she picked up the phone to call the cops. I 
assumed that they had already been there because she had a 
policeman's jacket on. 
 
Q: Okay. Keep going. 
 
A: And then she said, "If you don't get outta here, I'm going to call 
the police." 
 
Q: Who did she say that to? 
 
A: To O.J. 
 
Q: Did you say anything to him at that time? 
 
A: I looked around, and he went back into the dining room area, 
and I guess he went out the back way. 
 
Q: What happened next? 
 
A: I walked over to Nicole, I embraced her, and I asked her was 
she all right.  I don't know if she answered me. She was mad. So I 
said, "Well, if you need me" no. She said, "I want to just be left 
alone, A.C."  I said, "Well, if you need me, you call me," and I left. 
 
Q: Okay. When you first walked -- how did you get into the house? 
 
A: I don't know if the door was open or if I used my key or Nicole 
opened the door. I really don't know. 
 
Q: Well, you indicated the first time you saw Nicole herself, she 
was by the kitchen sink? 
 
A: Yeah. So I guess maybe the door was open. 
 
Q: Okay.  And what was Nicole doing, if anything, at the kitchen 
sink? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Was the water running? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay.  Could you describe the clothing she had on at that time 
that you saw her? 
 
A: She had on a warm-up bottoms, a jacket --  
 
Q: What color were the warm-up bottoms? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did you notice anything about the appearance of those bottoms? 
 
A: I think they had a white stripe on the side. I think. 
 
Q: Were they short or long? 
 
A: Long. 
 
Q: Were they dirty or clean? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay.  And you indicated she had a policeman's jacket on? 
 
A: It looked like a policeman's jacket. 
 
Q: Okay. Could you describe her facial appearance to me at that 
time? 
 
A: Red --  
 
Q: Where was she red? 
 
A: I don't know. You know how some people get mad and just turn 
red. 
 
Q: And that's in your opinion the only reason her face was red? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: What else about her facial appearance other than red? 
 
A: Seemed like she had been crying.  
 
Q: Anything else? 
 
A: No.  She was more mad than I've ever seen her. 
 
Q: How was that? How was she demonstrating that she was more 
mad than you've ever seen her? 
 
A: I've seen -- you know, she was mad. 
 
Q: Was she vocalizing her anger? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: What did she say specifically? 
 
A: She was swearing.  She was calling him I think she called him a 
son of a b----, a--hole. 
 
Q: Seem appropriate at the time? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. I don't know what happened. 
 
BY M. KELLY: 
 
Q: Other than "son of a b----" and "a--hole," what else did she say 
to you, A.C? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: She didn't tell you what happened? 
 
A: I don't know if she told me they were in bed or they were 
having sex.  I don't know. I can't remember exactly. 
 
Q: Nicole was one of your closest friends, wasn't she? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you were called over in the middle of the night because she 
was in a fight with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: I was called by Michelle. 
 
Q: By Michelle? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Then when you walked in the house, Nicole was angrier than 
you had ever seen her? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: More upset than you had ever seen her? 
 
A: Seemed like it, yes. 
 
Q: Her face was red? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: She had been crying? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: She was there with a policeman's jacket on? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: She was cussing out Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Could you please tell me what she told you at that time when 
you came into the kitchen, Mr. Cowlings? 
 
A: I don't remember. I can't remember the exact words that were 
used, sir. 
 
Q: Could you tell me in general terms what she told you had 
happened? 
 
A: I don't know if -- she said something about being in bed. I really 
-- I couldn't pinpoint it. 
 
Q: Mr. Cowlings, did you ask her what had happened? 
 
A: I don't remember asking Nicole what happened. 
 
Q: Under the circumstances I just related back to you, you did not 
ask Nicole what was wrong? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: When Nicole told me she didn't want to be 
bothered, she wanted to be left alone, I didn't push the issue. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did you think you knew what had happened? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: I wasn't there, sir.  I don't know what happened. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: I didn't ask you if you were there.  Did you think you knew 
what had happened? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did you talk to Mr. Simpson at all? 
 
A: Not at that particular time when he appeared into the kitchen, 
no. I asked him, "What are you doing?" 
 
Q: What did he say? 
 
A: He didn't -- I don't think he said anything. He just kinda like 
looked over to Nicole and he said, "Can I talk to you?" 
 
Q: And what did she say? 
 
A: She told -- I think she picked up the phone and started dialing, 
and I think she said, "If you don't leave, I'm going to call the 
police," or she was calling the police, and he turned around and 
walked back into the shadows. 
 
Q: Do you know whether he left the house or not? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know whether the car started or not? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Where was Michelle when you saw Nicole in the kitchen? 
 
A: I never saw Michelle. 
 
Q: So you don't even know whether she was there or not? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And you don't know whether Simpson had left the house or not? 
 
A: No, because when he walked back, I just turned back around 
and looked at Nicole, walked back over to the area where she was. 
 
Q: And it was your impression the police had been there already 
that night? 
 
A: Yeah, because that jacket she had on, I had never seen it, and it 
looked like a policeman's jacket. 
 
Q: Other than seeing the jacket, was there any other reason you 
thought the police had been there already that night? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Nicole tell you the police had been there that night? 
 
A: I don't know if she did or not. 
 
Q: You don't remember anything about this conversation yon had 
with her? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection -- 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember --   
 
MR. LEONARD: -- misstates his evidence before. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember her telling me about the police 
had been there. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did Mr. Simpson tell you the police had been there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Michelle when she called you tell you the police had been 
there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you see any indication on Nicole's face -- did you see any 
lumps on her? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did you see any bruises on her?  
 
A: I don't remember that. 
 
Q: Did you see any cuts on her?  
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: See any scratches on her?  
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did you see a hand print on her neck? 
 
A: No. I never looked at her neck. 
 
Q: Did you see a big mud smear down one of her legs on those 
white sweat pants? 
 
A: They could have been dirty. 
 
Q: Do you remember whether they were dirty? 
 
A: I don's know for sure if they were dirty. 
 
Q: Did you ever hear a car pulling out of the driveway after Mr. 
Simpson left the room? 
 
A: I don't remember hearing a car, no. 
 
Q: Did it strike you as a volatile situation in that house that you 
had been called over into, Mr. Cowlings? 
 
A: Volatile? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: What do you mean by that? 
 
Q: Like a threatening situation for Nicole. 
 
A: I don't know how threatening it was. 
 
Q: Well, did Michelle tell you there was a fight going on there? 
 
A: Michelle said they were fighting. 
 
Q: Okay. When you arrived there, you thought the police had been 
there already? 
 
A: My -- I don't know -- I didn't think about the police.  I was just, 
you know, thinking about what was happening inside, and then I 
went inside. 
 
Q: What did you think was happening inside? 
 
A: Was some problems going on some kinda way. I don't know if 
it was a verbal argument.  I don't know if it was a physical 
argument. All I know, it must have been pretty intense for Michelle 
to call and wake me up. 
 
Q: Okay. Would it have been pretty intense for the police to be 
called there also? 
 
A: That I don't know, sir. 
 
Q: You didn't think there was any reason to fear for Nicole's safety 
when you were there at that time? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did you?  I am asking him if he felt there was any reason for 
him to fear for Nicole's safety at that time. 
 
A: I would have been there for anybody's safety.  If O.J. was 
injured, I would have been there for his safety, too. 
 
Q: I'm not asking you about O.J.  Did you see any signs of injury 
on Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: When he was in the shadows, I didn't look at him -- when he 
came in and I asked him, "What are you doing," he looked over at 
Nicole and says, "Can I talk to you?" 
 
Q: Was he red? 
 
A: I didn't really get a good look at O.J. 
 
Q: Did he seem upset? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did he seem frightened? 
 
A: I don't know. He seemed to be upset. 
 
Q: Did you ever have to take Mr. Simpson to the hospital after 
being abused by Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he ever indicate to you that he was afraid of her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How big was Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: Fairly good size, 6-1. 
 
Q: How much did he weigh? 
 
A: I guess about 200 pounds, little bit over 200 pounds. 
 
Q: Do you think Nicole was any match for him in a fight? 
 
A: If she had something in her hand. 
 
Q: Did you see her with anything in her hands that night? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you think it was safe to leave that house with Nicole there 
in the kitchen that night? 
 
A: Well, she told me that -- she wanted to be left alone. 
 
Q: Did she say why she wanted to be left alone? 
 
A: No, she didn't. 
 
MR. KELLY: Can we take a break for five minutes. 
 
THE WITNESS: Sure. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the 
time is approximately 10:26. 
 
(Recess.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 10:34. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Mr. Cowlings, during this time when you were in the kitchen 
with Nicole, did you have any opportunity to observe what time it 
was then? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: And other than what you've testified to already, you cannot tell 
me anything else that Nicole said to you at that time? 
 
A: Not that I can remember, no. 
 
Q: Okay.  And do you recall seeing a lump over Nicole's right eye? 
 
A: When? 
 
Q: When you were in the kitchen at that time. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you recall seeing a lump on her right cheek? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you recall seeing a split lip? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you recall seeing scratches on her face? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you recall seeing scratches on her neck? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Is it your testimony that none of those injuries were there at that 
time? 
 
A: Not at that time. 
 
Q: You're certain that they were not there? 
 
A: I'm not certain they were not there.  I didn't notice them. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you ever prior to that night ever see any bruises on 
Nicole's face? 
 
A: Maybe her picking her face, if you want to refer to that as 
bruises. 
 
Q: I'm sorry. Had you ever seen indications on her face from her 
picking at it? 
 
A: I used to see her pick at it. I would hit her hand. 
 
Q: I realize that, Mr. Cowlings. Now, you have testified to, if I can 
have a moment... "Maybe her picking her face, if you want to refer 
to that as bruises."  Did you see any marks from when she had ever 
picked at her face? 
 
A: When you say "marks," what do you mean?  Little red little 
things as you pick? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: When she picked her face, I'd see them. 
 
Q: You did. 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Okay. When you testified yesterday --  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Did you get the answer?

marks left from her picking at her face yesterday?

A: I don't remember how long I was there. 
 
Q: Well, would you be able to approximate for me? 
 
A: No.

to Mr. Simpson. Correct? 
 
A: She said something about, "Get out of here or" -- she picked up 
the phone, and she was dialing 911, again, I guess. 
 
Q: Okay. You remember that.  You remember her saying a couple 
things to Mr. Simpson.  Correct? 
 
A: She said something about: "Get outta here."  I mean, that's 
vaguely what I remember.

Q: Okay. Other than that, what other activity did you and Nicole 
engage in? Anymore talking, other then what you've testified to 
already?

when you got there that morning? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you recall whether there were any cars in the driveway when 
you left --  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- that morning?  And once again, was it more than five minutes 
you were at the house at that time?

A: He asked me how was Nicole, and I said, "She seems to be 
okay," and I said, "Where are you," and he was over at [Name 
Deleted]'s house. 
 
Q: That's all he said? 
 
A: And he wanted me to come over. 
 
Q: To [Name Deleted] 's house? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What was your understanding of what he was asking you when 
he said, "Is Nicole okay?" 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I have no idea.  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: You didn't ask him what he meant by that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you get the impression he was asking about her physical 
well-being? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know what his reason for him to ask me 
how she was. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: How did you know to answer, Mr. Cowlings? 
 
A: Pardon? 
 
Q: How did you know what to answer if you didn't know what he 
was asking you? 
 
A: I said, "She seems to be okay." 
 
Q: And that's all you said? 
 
A: That's all I said. 
 
Q: Did he ask you whether you had any conversation with Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he ask you if the police had come back again? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he ask you whether you had any conversations with Nicole 
about the police? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he indicate to you that the police had been there earlier that 
morning? 
 
A: Not on the phone. 
 
Q: Did he indicate to you that he was concerned about a police 
report being filed, in that phone conversation? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he indicate to you why he wanted you to come over to 
[Name Deleted] 's early on New Year's Day? 
 
A: I guess he wanted to talk to me when I got there. 
 
Q: Did he tell you that on the phone?  
 
A: He just asked me to come over. 
 
Q: Do you recall what time it was at this point? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: It was early, though? 
 
A: Yeah, it was still early. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was it after 6:00 o'clock in the morning? 
 
A: I have no knowledge.  It was light outside. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you know whether it was after  7:00 o'clock in the 
morning? 
 
A: No, I don't remember. 
 
Q: When Mr. Simpson said he wanted you to come over to [Name 
Deleted] 's, what did you do? 
 
A: I got in my car and drove over. 
 
Q: How long between the time you hung up the phone from Mr. 
Simpson and drove over there? 
 
A: Five minutes. 
 
Q: And how long a time had elapsed from the -- time Michelle 
called you earlier on the phone to the time you got in the car and 
drove over there the first time? 
 
A: Hours. I couldn't tell you exactly. The exact time, I wouldn't 
know. 
 
Q: Well, was it more than five minutes, or less? 
 
A: What? 
 
MR. RE: I think he misunderstood the question. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. Let me ask it again then. 
 
Q: When Michelle called you very early that New Year's morning 
and told you something about a fight, when you hung up the phone 
from her, how much time elapsed before you were in the car and 
heading over to Rockingham.? 
 
A: I don't know.  I just threw on some sweat pants and I guess a T-
shirt or a sweat shirt and jumped in the car. 
 
Q: Less than five minutes? 
 
A: Yeah, it takes less than five minutes to put that on. 
 
Q: Okay. And where did the [Name Deleted] 's live at this point? 
 
A: On Mandeville Canyon. 
 
Q: And how long a drive is that from where you were living? 
 
A: Probably the same distance. Mandeville Canyon and 
Rockingham are one street apart -- or one -- well, they're not one 
street, but they in the same vicinity. 
 
Q: Okay. Well, how far was Rockingham from where you were 
living at that time? 
 
A: In mileage, three, four miles, I guess.  Could be --  
 
Q: Well, how long did it take you to drive over to Rockingham --  
 
A: I didn't time it. I'm sorry. 
 
Q: How long did it take you to drive over to Rockingham that 
morning when Michelle called you? 
 
A: It didn't take me that long at all. 
 
Q: Less than 10 minutes? 
 
A: Oh, definitely. 
 
Q: Okay.  Less than five minutes? 
 
A: I couldn't tell you less than five.  Could have been five. 
 
Q: Okay.  And [Name Deleted] 's house was approximately the 
same distance away? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And did you happen to see what time it was as you 
headed over to [Name Deleted] 's house? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you happen to see what time it was when you got to [Name 
Deleted] 's house? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What happened when you got to [Name Deleted] 's house? 
 
A: [Name Deleted] opened the door, and [Name Deleted] said  
"What's going on, A.C.?"  I said, "I don't know. It seemed like they 
got into a fight." 
 
And he said, "Well, O.J.'s in the" -- they had like a study or a little 
room. 
 
Q: So I'm clear, Michelle told you that Simpson and Nicole were 
fighting? 
 
A: Fighting, right. 
 
Q: And when you talked to [Name Deleted], he told you  that 
Nicole and Simpson had had a fight? 
 
A: No. I think he asked me what was going on, and I said, "I think, 
you know, that they had a fight." 
 
Q: And that was your impression? 
 
A: Yes, that was my impression. 
 
Q: That they had equally participated in a fight. 
 
A: There was a fight. 
 
Q: It was your impression that Nicole and Simpson had equally 
participated in a fight with one another? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know, sir. I wasn't there. I don't know 
what exactly happened between the two of them. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did you have any idea what had happened between the two of 
them? 
 
A: They were pissed off -- I mean, she was pissed off.  It was 
obvious that something happened. 
 
Q. Did she tell you at 3:30 in the morning that Simpson had 
punched her? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did she tell you at 3:30 in the morning when you were over 
there that he had pulled her hair? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did Nicole tell you at 3:30 in the morning when you were over 
there that he had split her lip? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did Nicole tell you at 3:30 in the morning when you were over 
there that Simpson had slapped her?

over there that Simpson had kicked her?

there that he had -- that Simpson had choked her?

there that Simpson beat the s--- out of her? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did Nicole tell you at 3:30 in the morning when you went over 
there that she thought Simpson was going to kill her? 
 
A: I don't remember her saying that. 
 
Q: Is it your testimony that she did not say any of these things to 
you? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: She may have said one or more of these things to you? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Tell me what happened, now, after you arrived at [Name 
Deleted] 's house. 
 
A: [Name Deleted] and I spoke, and I walked into the little den or 
the little room that O.J. was in, and he was sitting on the couch --  
 
Q: What was he wearing? 
 
A: I don't know exactly what O.J. was wearing. He had a blanket. I 
don't know if it was shoulder high or -- I mean neck high or just 
halfway.  I guess he was cold or something. 
 
Q: Did he tell you he was cold? 
 
A: I just assumed he was cold. He had a blanket on him. 
 
Q: Okay. Were you concerned for his health at that time? 
 
A Didn't appear to me that he was in any harm. 
 
Q: Okay. What was [Name Deleted] wearing when he opened the 
door? 
 
A: Pardon? 
 
Q: What was [Name Deleted] wearing when he opened the door? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Was he in nighttime clothing?  
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Pajamas? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Was it your impression he had been up for while? 
 
A: I don't know how long he was up. He was up. He opened the 
door. 
 
Q: Did you see [Name Deleted]  at that time? 
 
A. I don't remember if I saw [Name Deleted] . 
 
Q: Okay.  You had indicated that -- Was it your impression that 
[Name Deleted]  was one of Nicole's closest friends? 
 
A: They were friends. I don't know how close, but they were 
friends. 
 
Q: Would you consider [Name Deleted]  at that  time one of 
Nicole's closest friends? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know how close they were. They were 
friends. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Go on. Tell me what happened after you walked into this 
room and saw Simpson. 
 
A: I asked him what was going on. 
 
Q: And what did he tell you? 
 
A: He kinda like, oh, said something about -- I don't know if he 
said, "Ah, man, she's crazy." I don't know if he said that. 
 
And I said, "What happened? What started all this?": and I think he 
said something to the effect that she was accusing him of buying 
jewelry for someone -- some woman or some girl.    
 
Q: What else did he say? 
 
A: He didn't go into any more detail. 
 
Q: Nothing else? 
 
A: He just said -- he asked me, would I go -- he had -- I guess when 
he had left the first time -- I don't know if he did it the second time, 
but he had taken Nicole's jewelry. It was like a little black velvet --  
 
Q: Jewelry bag? 
 
A: Yeah.   
 
Q: Okay.  
 
A: And he said, would I go get it for him, and I said, "Go get it?" 
 
He said, "Yeah. It's in."-- he had hid it in a neighbor's house --  at a 
neighbor's house in the garbage can. 
 
Q: And he was telling you Nicole was crazy? 
 
A: He --  
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: He said, "Oh, she's crazy."   "Crazy" could be 
used in a loose term as, you know, "Ah, man, that man is crazy." 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Yeah, you used it when you walked into that bathroom in 1977 
in San Francisco and Mr. Simpson had thrown all Nicole's clothes 
out of the window, didn't you? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Misstates the evidence. 
 
THE WITNESS: -- Pardon? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Didn't you walk into that bathroom in 1977 when Mr. Simpson 
had thrown Nicole's clothes out of the window and told him, "Man, 
you're crazy"? 
 
MR. RE: Are you referring to '77? 
 
THE WITNESS: He's referring to '79. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: '79? 
 
A: I wasn't in San Francisco in '77. 
 
Q: In '79 then. That's exactly what you said to him when you 
walked in that bathroom? 
 
A: I said, "Are you crazy?" 
 
Q: All right. Okay. Go on. I'm sorry to interrupt you. 
 
A: So I said, "Well, where did you hide it?" He says, "Well, I know 
I went over" -- no, no, I take that back.  I take that back.  Besides 
the jewelry bag, he had lost his keys, his car keys, so he -- I said, 
"Well, let's backtrack, and how did you leave?" 
 
So he had went over the [Names Deleted] es' wall.  At that time it 
was -- I don't think they had the tennis court then. So I backtracked. 
I'm climbing over fences and --  
 
Q: Wait a minute. You're still in a room with Mr. Simpson, talking 
to him. 
 
A: No. I left when he had asked me --  
 
Q: Well, let's not leave yet. We are back there, and Mr. Simpson 
has told you Nicole's crazy, and then he tells you he hid her 
jewelry in a neighbor's trash can.  Is that correct? 
 
A: That was one of the things.  Then he told me that he couldn't 
find his car keys.  He had--  
 
Q: How had he gotten over to [Name Deleted] 's? 
 
A: I guess he must have walked. 
 
Q: Okay.  What else did he tell you at that time? 
 
A: He told me to look for his keys and to get the jewelry bag. 
 
Q: Did he tell you why he had taken the jewelry? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he tell you where he had lost the keys? 
 
A: Somewhere between the house and where the -- he hid the 
jewelry. 
 
Q: What was Mr. Simpson wearing, other than a blanket, when you 
were talking to him at [Name Deleted] 's? 
 
A: I didn't say he was wearing a blanket.  I said he had a blanket 
over him.  
 
Q: Did you see what he had on underneath the blanket? 
 
A: He had clothes on. 
 
Q: Was [Name Deleted] in the room when you were talking to 
Simpson? 
 
A: He could have been. 
 
Q: Was he? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: How long were you at [Name Deleted] 's at this point? 
 
A: After O.J. gave me the directions how to try to find his keys and 
to --  
 
Q: What directions did he give you to find his keys, first of all? 
 
A: His direction where he went when he left the house with his car 
keys -- with the car keys and with the -- oh, let me back up.  Let me 
back up. It wasn't his car keys.  It was [Name Deleted]'s car keys to 
his car. 
 
Q: [Name Deleted]'s car keys --  
 
A: [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: [Name Deleted]'s car keys to [Name Deleted]'s car? 
 
A: Right.  I mean, so O.J. must have used his car to come back up 
there when I saw O.J. when I was in the kitchen. 
 
Q: Okay.  So it was your impression that Simpson had been to 
[Name Deleted] 's and then was back at Rockingham by the time 
you got there? 
 
A: When he told me it was [Name Deleted] 's keys, I said, "What 
do you mean, [Name Deleted] 's keys?"  He says, "I used [Name 
Deleted]'s car." 
 
Q: For what? 
 
A: I guess to go back up to the house. 
 
Q: At what time? 
 
A: I guess when I saw him in the dining room. 
 
Q: Okay.  And what specific directions did Simpson give you in 
terms of finding those keys? 
 
A: It was over a fence --  
 
Q: What fence? 
 
A: The [Names Deleted] es. 
 
Q: What type of fence was that? 
 
A: Chain-link fence.  It could have been a wooden fence. 
 
Q: Did he indicate to you he had climbed over that chain-link 
fence? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you go back to that chain-link fence? 
 
A: Yes.   
 
Q: Did you see that the prongs on the top of that fence had been 
bent at all? 
 
A: I don't remember i there's any prongs on top of that fence. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you see any indication from the bushes that he had 
climbed over at that point? 
 
A: No. I was just, you know, retracing his path that he said he took. 
 
Q: Now, did you have any trouble getting over that chain-link 
fence? 
 
A: I don't know if I went over the chain-link fence or I opened his-
the chain-link fence, I don't know if I opened it and walked, but I 
did find the keys over the wooden fence. 
 
Q: Okay, but that's not what I asked you, Mr. Cowlings.  I asked 
you, did you climb over that chain-link fence at any time? 
 
A: I don't remember climbing over the fence. 
 
Q: Did he tell you that he had climbed over, though? 
 
A: No. He just gave me the path that he went. 
 
Q: Right. Did he tell you his path --  
 
A: He didn't --  
 
Q: Let me finish. 
 
A: He didn't tell me he climbed over the fence. He just said that's 
the way he went. 
 
Q: Well, let me ask you: Did you find the keys next to a gate? 
 
A: I found the keys next to the fence, the wooden fence at the 
[Names Deleted] es. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He is talking about the property on the other 
side of the tennis court. 
 
THE WITNESS: Pardon? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The property on the other side of the tennis 
court? 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know if the [Names Deleted] es had put in 
their --  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Other side of O.J.'s tennis court. 
 
THE WITNESS:  Yes, that's the [Names Deleted] es' property. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Here is one. 85. Wait a second. That's Exhibit 
100. 
 
MR. KELLY: It says Exhibit- oh, okay. 100. 
 
Q: I want to ask you to look at this diagram, which is a layout of 
the Rockingham residence, for a minute, Mr. Cowlings, just to get  
acquainted with it.  Do you recognize that diagram? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. And is that the diagram of the Rockingham residence 
we're discussing? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Now could you tell me or indicate on there first with 
your finger without making any marks where you looked for Mr. 
Simpson's keys? 
 
A: I came out where he said from the back, walked (Indicating) -- I 
don't think this pool was here yet (Indicating). 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: It was -- all this was brick, red brick (Indicating). I came and 
went across the court, got to the fence (Indicating).  I looked 
around that fence, went through, jumped -- no. I walked onto their 
court. You could walk across their court, and there's like a three-
foot little thing, steps.  So I went up and I looked around the 
jacuzzi, I think --  
 
Q: Mr. Simpson didn't indicate he stopped for a jacuzzi there, did 
he? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: I looked around there.  I continued towards the -- he said he had 
jumped the wooden fence that runs along Ashford, so I went over --  
 
Q: Not to his property? 
 
A: No. From the [Names Deleted] es. That's -- Von -- I mean, 
[Names Deleted]  have a -- there's brick about three feet, then it's 
wood. 
 
Q: Right. 
 
A: It goes maybe about five-foot high, four foot. I don't know 
exactly.  So I went to where he approximately said, and I looked 
around on the house side, inside the yard, and I didn't see it, and 
when I put my hands up to jump over the fence. I kinda looked 
down, and I saw the keys had -- the brick and the grass right there, 
there was two keys. 
 
Q: The [Names Deleted] es have a gate that goes onto their 
property, don't they? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: That's in the corner of the Ashford property there? 
 
A: Things have been redone since -- see, a lot of work has been 
done over there, and a lot of work has been done --  
 
Q: Okay. And I am talking about New Year's morning in 1989 
when you went over there. There was a swinging gate, a gate that 
you could open to walk onto [Names Deleted] es property from 
Rockingham. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Okay. And that was in the very corner of the property, was it 
not? 
 
A: No. You talking -- I think you talking about the second gate.  
There's another walkway gate that I went to. 
 
Q: How did you get from Simpson's property onto [Names 
Deleted] '? 
 
A: There is a gate here (Indicating) off of this court, right --  
 
Q: Right. 
 
A: -- in this corner here (Indicating) there is like a cabana here, a 
kitchen light, and there is a gate right here (Indicating) that leads 
you into [Names Deleted] ' tennis court. 
 
Q: Okay. How far from that gate did you look for those keys first 
at that fence? 
 
A: I was looking down the whole time. 
 
Q: I am asking you, how far from the gate did you walk in a 
southerly fashion along that property line looking for those keys? 
 
A: Southerly fashion? 
 
Q: Well, from this gate --  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- you indicated you had looked in this direction for keys.  Is 
that correct? 
 
A: No. The keys are over here (Indicating). This is Ashford here 
(Indicating). 
 
Q: I understand that.  You indicated first that you looked on either 
side of a fence for keys, did you not? 
 
A: As soon as I started walking, retracing his steps --  
 
Q: Right. 
 
A: -- I was looking down for the keys. 
 
Q: Right. And when you got to that fence at the back of the 
property that fronts [Names Deleted]  property, where did you look 
there for keys? 
 
A: Which fence are you speaking about now? 
 
Q: The first fence you got to. 
 
A: When I walked -- when I got to this gate (Indicating) to lead me 
into the [Names Deleted] ? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: What did I do? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: I was --  
 
Q: Did you stop before the gate? 
 
A: I looked -- as I was walking, I was looking down to see if I 
could see the keys. 
 
Q: Right. 
 
A: Now, I was stopped a few seconds, maybe to take the latch off 
of this fence --  
 
Q: Before you took the latch off of the  fence, had you looked 
anywhere else along that fence for keys? 
 
A: I looked on the path that he had told me. 
 
Q: Mr. Cowlings --  
 
A: I looked around the fence to see, and I kept -- 
 
Q: How far to either side of that gate along --  
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: -- that fence did you look for the keys? 
 
A: I'm sorry. 
 
Q: Was it more than 10 feet to the right of that gate did you look 
for the keys? 
 
A: I couldn't tell you. 
 
Q: Was it more than 10 feet to the left of that gate that you looked 
for the keys? 
 
A: I couldn't tell you. 
 
Q: Did you look anywhere other than right a the gate for the keys? 
 
A: I looked on the ground. 
 
Q: Did you look on the ground to the right of the gate? 
 
A: I looked around. 
 
Q: Did you look anywhere on the ground to the right of the gate for 
those keys, Mr. Cowlings? 
 
A: I don't know which side, I was looking on the left side or -- I 
looked around the area. 
 
Q: How did Mr. Cowlings tell you he --  
 
A: I'm --  
Q: Mr. Simpson.  How did Mr. Simpson tell you got from -- that he 
got from [Names Deleted]  -- I am sorry. Strike that whole 
question. 
 
How did Mr. Simpson tell you he got from his property onto 
[Names Deleted] ' property? 
 
A: He never said to me how he got there.  Oh, he went -- he 
walked.  I mean, I guess either he ran or he walked.  I don't know.  
He didn't go into details how he got there.  He just told me how he 
went when he left his house. 
 
Q: Tell me exactly what he told you in terms of leaving his house, 
what he did. 
 
A: He told me that he had taken the jewelry and that he had 
dropped the keys. 
 
Q: And then he told you what route he took also, didn't he? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Tell me what route he told you he took. 
 
A: He went across his tennis court, into the [Names Deleted] es' 
backyard --  
 
Q: Did he tell you how he got into the [Names Deleted] es' 
backyard? 
 
A: I just assumed he went through that gate. 
 
Q: Go on. 
 
A: Then he told me that he walked up, jumped -- walked up the 
steps, went across and jumped over the wood frame fence at the 
[Names Deleted] es. 
 
Q: And how tall is that wood frame fence? 
 
A: Could be five feet, for all I know. 
 
Q: Okay. Is that there today? 
 
A: I don't know what's there today.  Somebody bought the house. 
They could have torn it down, for all I know. 
 
Q: Would you recognize the fence if you saw a picture of it? 
 
A: If it's still there, yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And then where exactly did you find the keys? 
 
A: As I jumped -- grabbed to jump the fence from the inside of the 
yard, as I got -- bracing myself up, I looked along and then I 
spotted the keys wedged between the grass and the brick part of the 
foundation. 
 
Q: Okay.  Two keys on a key ring? 
 
A: It was on something.  I don't know exactly if it was a key ring 
or just a wire circle thing. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you see any of the Simpsons' dogs out when you 
went through the yard at that time? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Was it light out at that time? 
 
A: Yeah, it was light. 
 
Q: How did you get onto Simpson's property when you went back 
there? 
 
A: I guess I came through the front door. 
 
Q: Did you go into the house? 
 
A: Probably walked through the house.  I don't remember -- I don't 
know if I went through the house or I went around. I don't 
remember that. 
 
Q: Do you remember how you got through the gate? 
 
A: Probably with my key. 
 
Q: Did you have -- you had a key to the gate? 
 
A: I have a key to the house. 
 
Q: And that works on the gate also? 
 
A: Yes, it works the front door and the gate -- I mean it works the 
gate on Rockingham and it opens the front door. 
 
Q: Is it a key or a card? 
 
A: A key. 
 
Q: It's a key. Okay.  Do you recall where you parked when you 
went back over there to look? 
 
A: Maybe I parked on Rockingham, since I was -- I had to use the 
key to open the gate. 
 
Q: And then you manually opened the gate? 
 
A: Automatically.  When you put the key and turn it, it 
automatically opens. 
 
Q: Does it disengage, or does it open all the way by itself? 
 
A: By itself? No. You have to turn this key to open the gate. It 
stays open for a few seconds. Once it's completely open, then it 
closes automatically. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall whether you parked in the driveway or on 
the street? 
 
A: No, I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you have a specific recollection as to whether you 
went in the house or not at that time? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Can you tell me at this point what time it was, approximately? 
 
A: It was a bright, sunny day.  I couldn't tell you exactly what time. 
 
Q: Was it before 8:00 o'clock in the morning? 
 
A: It could have been. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you see Nicole at that time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you see Michelle at that time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you see anybody at the house at that time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you recall knocking on the door? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Ringing the doorbell? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Checking to see if Nicole was okay? 
 
A: No, not that time. 
 
Q: Did you have any concern for Nicole's safety at that point? 
 
A: Didn't think of it. 
 
Q: Did you have any concern for Nicole's health at that point? 
 
A: Didn't think of it. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you have any concern about Nicole reporting the 
previous incident to the police at that time? 
 
A: I don't know what Nicole had done. 
 
Q: Okay. All right. Tell me what you did after you found the keys. 
 
A: I got the keys, and the house was on -- the house where he hid 
the jewelry -- the house was located on Bristol.  It was two houses 
from the corner, going north.  I got to Ashford and Bristol.  It was 
two houses (Indicating) up from the corner.  I went back there.  I 
was thinking, I said, here I am jumping fences and stuff; I may get 
shot, some black guy jumping fences.  I'm, you know, thinking to 
myself, and -- 
 
Q: You ever been stopped by the LAPD before this day? 
 
A: This time? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: This time for what? 
 
Q: For anything. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Never in 20 years prior to New Year's Day 1989 LAPD ever 
stop you for anything? 
 
A: Well, for a traffic violation. 
 
Q: How many times was that? 
 
A: I wouldn't know. 
 
Q: More than once? 
 
A: I guess. 
 
Q Ever get hassled by any cops? 
 
A: No. Always been very nice to me. 
 
Q: Okay. I'm sorry. Go on. 
 
A: So he said it was in the garbage cans down the driveway behind 
the house.  So I went there, picked up the lid, and there it was. And 
I picked it up and brought the keys -- no.  I drove [Name Deleted]'s 
car back.  No, no, I didn't.  No, I didn't, because I had my car.  I 
may have drove [Name Deleted]'s car back. [Name Deleted] had a 
souped-up Buick -- 
 
THE REPORTER: "Buick"? 
 
THE WITNESS: A Buick, souped-up --  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: A Regal, is that what you said? 
 
A: No.  It was a special edition that Buick had put out. It was a 
very -- what we call muscle cars, very powerful. He had like a --  
 
Q: V-12 or something? 
 
A: He had a turbo thing to it.  So I think I brought his car back. I 
think I did, because [Name Deleted] wanted me to bring his car 
back. 
 
Q: Where was [Name Deleted]'s car parked at that time? 
 
A: His car? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: It was parked -- the black car was parked --

A: No. 
 
Q: Did he tell you how he had gotten back into the house after 
parking the car there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was it your impression that Simpson had gone through [Names 
Deleted] ' property and into the back of his property and got back 
in the house after he had [Name Deleted] 's car? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know how he got back into the house. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Do you know why [Name Deleted] 's car just wasn't parked in 
the driveway at Rockingham? 
 
A: I have no knowledge. 
 
Q: Did Simpson tell you why he had taken the jewelry? 
 
A: I don't know. I don't remember what he had said.  He said --  
 
Q: Did you ask him why he had taken Nicole's jewelry? 
 
A: He said the jewelry was his and hers, and I guess -- I never 
looked in the bag.  He claimed that his jewelry was in there and her 
jewelry was in there. 
 
Q: Did he say why he had taken the jewelry? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ask him?  
 
A: No.

Q: Was the bag heavy? 
 
A: What do you mean by that "heavy"? 
 
Q: Well, was there some weight to it? 
 
A: Yeah, there was some weight to it. 
 
Q: Okay. More than a couple pounds?  
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: And what happened after you found the bag? 
 
A: I -- 
 
Q: By the way, did you see anybody at all while you were climbing 
through everybody's backyards and garbage cans and things? 
 
A: I was hoping nobody would see me. 
 
Q: Did you ever find out that anybody had seen you? 
 
A: Not to my knowledge. 
 
Q: All right. Go on. What happened after you found the jewelry 
bag in the garbage can? 
 
A: I took it back to him and --  
 
Q: You drove [Name Deleted] 's car back, first of all? 
 
A: Yeah, drove [Name Deleted] 's car back, and I walked into -- he 
was still in that little den room and --   
 
Q: Did he still have his blanket over him? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did he have an ice pack on his head or anything? 
 
A: I don't remember that. I don't remember seeing an ice pack. 
 
Q: Did he indicate to you he was injured in  any way? 
 
A: He didn't say so to me. 
 
Q: Okay. So who did you see when you first got back to [Name 
Deleted] 's house again? 
 
A: Probably [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: What, if anything, did you say to him? 
 
A: At that point I think we all were somewhat -- I mean, because 
nobody knew vaguely anything, I mean, outside of what O.J. said.  
I mean --  
 
Q: Well, Simpson knew something, didn't he? 
 
A: I guess he did. He was there.  
 
Q: And he wasn't telling you? 
 
A: He wasn't telling me. 
 
Q: And he wasn't telling [Name Deleted] ? 
 
A: Didn't sound like it when [Name Deleted] asked me what 
happened. 
 
Q: Okay. And you didn't ask him? 
 
A: He didn't volunteer. 
 
Q: He didn't want to talk about it, did he? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lacks foundation.  Calls for 
speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: That I don't know. He didn't tell me anything. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: He didn't offer you anything?  
 
A: Not that I can remember. 
 
Q: Okay. So tell me what [Name Deleted]  said when you first got 
back there. 
 
A: Pardon? 
 
Q: Could you tell me what [Name Deleted] said to you when you 
first returned back to his house? 
 
A: I don't know if he said, "Did you find the keys" or "Did you get 
my car?"  I said, "Yes. I don't know if he said, "What's going on? 
What's happening?" I really don't know what exactly [Name 
Deleted] said to me when I got back. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you tell him you had the keys? 
 
A: Yeah, I put his car back. 
 
Q: Did you show [Name Deleted]  the jewelry bag you had? 
 
A: I don't know if he saw it in my hand.  I don't know if I said 
"Here it is: or not.  I don't know.  I don't remember.  I still had it in 
my hand. 
 
Q: Okay. When you went back to Rockingham this time, did Mr. 
Simpson ask you to check on Nicole? 
 
A: I don't remember him saying that. 
 
Q: Okay. His only concern was the jewelry? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know what his concern was.  He asked me 
to find the keys and get the jewelry back. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  Did [Name Deleted] ask you to check on Nicole at all? 
 
A: Not that I can remember. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was [Name Deleted]'s only concern  that you recall was 
his car? 
 
A: He asked me to get his car, bring his car back.  I don't know --  
 
Q: Did Mr. [Name Deleted]  show any concern about anything 
other than getting his car back? 
 
A: I don't know what he was concerned about. 
 
Q: Did he ask you about anything other than his car at that time? 
 
A: I guess what was going on. 
 
Q: Did you know? 
 
A: At the time, no, I didn't know. I was just as confused as 
everybody else. 
 
Q: Did [Name Deleted] ask you anything about Nicole? 
 
A: I don't remember. He could have. 
 
Q: Okay. The only thing you remember [Name Deleted] talking 
about was getting his car back, though?  
 
A: Yeah, he wanted his car back. 
 
MR. KELLY: Could you read the last question back, please. 
 
(Question read.) 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Can you answer that with a yes or no, Mr. Cowlings? 
 
MR. RE: He's already told you he talked about something else to 
him, so --  
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember -- all I know, [Name Deleted], 
you know, he wanted his car back, and whatever else he said, I 
don't remember. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  The only thing you remember [Name Deleted] talking to 
you about was getting his car back? 
 
A: Yeah, because --  
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Asked and answered. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: I am sorry? 
 
A: Well, I knew it had to be the car because --  
 
MR. KELLY: Did you get the previous answer down? 
 
(Discussion held off the record.) 
 
(Record read.) 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: And the only thing you recall at that time Mr. Simpson asking 
you to check on were [Name Deleted]'s keys and the jewelry.  Is 
that correct also? 
 
A: He told me to find the keys and get the jewelry back. 
 
Q: Other than those two things, did he ask you to do anything else? 
Yes or no. 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: As far as you remember, Mr. Cowlings, did Mr. Simpson ask 
you to do anything other then get the keys and get the jewelry? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Do you not remember that you don't remember? 
 
A: You asked me things, and I'm giving you my answer. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: I am just trying to get a simple yes or no out of a simple 
question. 
 
A: If I could tell you definitely, I will tell you, sir. I don't know 
definitely. I don't remember. 
 
Q: What did -- I assume you gave the jewelry bag to Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did he say when you gave it back to him? 
 
A: He was just talking, babbling off about stuff. 
 
Q: Could you be a little more specific than that about what he was 
babbling about? 
 
A: I didn't stay there that long. 
 
Q: Then it wasn't a long conversation, was it? 
 
A: Not with me. 
 
Q: Okay. Well, can you tell me what he said in that short period of 
time to you?

Q: Well, in general terms can you tell me what he was talking 
about? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Was he talking about Nicole at all? 
 
A: He could have been. 
 
Q: Do you have any general recollection at all of him talking about 
Nicole? 
 
A: No, I do not have a general. 
 
Q: You remember very specifically that Mr. Simpson said that 
Nicole was crazy, do you not? 
 
A: He said something to that terms, "Oh, she's crazy."  That was at 
the -- when I first saw him that morning. 
 
Q: In fact, he said that she's crazy in the context of him going 
through two fences and jumping around and losing car keys and 
hiding jewelry bags in garbage cans, did he not? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know, sir.  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: And you have no recollection as you sit here today what Mr. 
Simpson was babbling about after you gave him the jewelry bag? 
 
A: No, I don't. 
 
Q: Was he upset at that time? 
 
A: He was nervous. 
 
Q: Why did you think he was nervous? 
 
A: He seemed like he was nervous. 
 
Q: What was he nervous about? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. 
 
(Discussion held off the record.) 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: At any time when you were over at [Name Deleted] 's, did 
Simpson indicate to you the police were looking for him? 
 
A: I think he did mention to me -- I don't know if he mentioned it 
to me or [Name Deleted] did. 
 
Q: What did [Name Deleted] say to you? 
 
A: [Name Deleted] was kinda like -- because O.J. woke him up, 
and it was very confusing for [Name Deleted] and --  
 
Q: Why was it very confusing for him? 
 
A: He was woke up. O.J.'s knocking at his door. 
 
Q: Is that how he told you he woke up?

your door.  I don't know what time it was.  It had to be early in the 
morning.

Simpson came knocking on his door early in the morning? 
 
A: I think, yeah. 
 
Q: Okay.  What else did [Name Deleted]  tell you? 
 
A: He didn't -- outside of that, he didn't know.  He just said O.J. 
was babbling.

[Name Deleted]  had said something about the police.  What did 
[Name Deleted]  say?

came out of O.J.'s mouth, that the police -- he went -- when he 
pulled out of his driveway -- I think -- I don't know how Nicole -- 
all I know, he said that the police were coming after him.  He went 
out the driveway. He went one way, they went the other way, so he 
lost them. 
 
Q: Okay. Was it your impression the police were still looking for 
Simpson as he sat there in [Name Deleted] 's room.' 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did he indicate or was he nervous, was Mr. Simpson nervous 
that the police were still looking for him? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation.

He was nervous.  I don't know what he was nervous about. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Was he nervous that he was going to be arrested for beating the

THE WITNESS: I don't --  
 
MR. LEONARD: -- calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: -- know that sir. 
 
MR. BREWER: Mr. Cowlings, if he starts making objections, 
would you let him finish so we can hear you answers, because I 
didn't hear what you were saying because you were talking. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: What happened next after Simpson babbled for that short period 
of time? 
 
A: I left to go up to the house to check on Nicole. 
 
Q: Did Simpson seem disoriented at all when you were talking to 
him at that time? 
 
A: He seemed to be confused somewhat. 
 
Q: Did he ask you to go up to the house and check on Nicole?

A: Yeah. She was sitting down. 
 
Q: Was anybody -- did you see anybody else before you saw 
Nicole? 
 
A: Not that I remember.  She was holding the baby. I think she was 
feeding the baby. 
 
Q: Which baby are we talking about? 
 
A: Must have been Sydney.  Yeah, it was Sydney, I guess, yeah. 
 
Q: Well, you're sure it was Sydney? 
 
A: When was Justin born? 
 
Q: Shortly before this.

or...

baby? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Could you tell me what she was wearing at that time? 
 
A: She could have had a robe on. 
 
Q: Okay. What, if anything, did you say to her when you walked in 
the kitchen? 
 
A: Asked her how she felt, was she all right. 
 
Q: What did she tell you? 
 
A: I don't know if she told me then -- she could have probably told 
me her head hurts.  She could have told me that her head hurts. 
 
Q: Did she tell you anything else? 
 
A: I don't know if -- I think I got up and walked over to her and -- 
 
Q: You got up from where? 
 
A: From where I was sitting -- and walked over to her and looked 
at her, because I think she was like touching her head up in this 
area, something like that (Indicating). 
 
Q: Indicating the upper-right forehead area? 
 
A: I don't know what side it was.  All I remember is she was, you 
know, like touching her head (Indicating), saying -- - 
 
Q: You are indicating the right side of you  forehead with your 
right hand.

done to her? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Was that an injury she was showing to you when she pointed to 
her head that you came over and looked at? 
 
A: She just -- when she said her head was hurting, she rubbed the 
spot, I guess, that was hurting. 
 
Q: Okay. And show me exactly where she rubbed. 
 
A: I don't remember exactly.  I don't know what side of the head

BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: In your opinion was she upset at that  time, still? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And was upset about what had happened earlier that morning 
between her and Mr. Simpson? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation.  Lack of 
foundation.

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation. 
 
BY MR., KELLY: 
 
Q: I am sorry. I didn't hear you. 
 
A: Well, you told me to wait.  Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. What happened next after -- What  else did she tell you at 
that point? 
 
A: She just wanted to be left alone. 
 
Q: Did she tell you that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was she mad at you? 
 
A: No. So I said, "Okay." 
 
Q: Did you tell her where Mr. Simpson was at that point? 
 
A: She didn't ask. 
 
Q: Did you tell her where he was? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. How long were you in the kitchen for at this point? 
 
A: Few minutes. You know, she seemed -- said she was okay, and 
when I asked her did she want me to take her to the hospital, she 
said "No."  I said, "You gonna be okay?"  And she said, "Yes." 
 
Q: Then what happened next? 
 
A: I think I drove -- I don't know if I went home to change clothes 
or if I went back down to [Name Deleted]'s.  I think I called 
Wayne. 
 
Q: Where did you call him from? 
 
A: I think I called him -- I don't know if I went back to my 
apartment or I went down to [Name Deleted]'s, but I called Wayne. 
 
Q: Well, when was the last -- when was the next time you were at 
[Name Deleted] 's that you can remember? 
 
A: Well, I eventually did go back to [Name Deleted].  I don't know 
if I went directly from O.J.'s house to [Name Deleted] or I went 
home first to change, because prior to all this happening Wayne 
and O.J. and myself had made plans to go to the Rose Bowl.  SC 
was playing -- I think SC was playing in the Rose Bowl that day. 
 
Q: Okay.  And do you know what time you called Wayne Hughes? 
 
A: Early enough where I could tell him that I wasn't going to go, so 
he'd have time to use the ticket for someone else. 
 
Q: Why weren't you going to the Rose Bowl? 
 
A: I was upset to what had happened. 
 
Q: Were you upset about what happened to Nicole? 
 
A: Nicole and the whole situation. 
 
Q: Okay. "What did you tell Wayne Hughes? 
 
A: I told him that it was a fight between O.J. and Nicole. 
 
Q: From what you had seen and heard so far, was it still your belief 
that it was a fight between two people? 
 
A: Seemed to be, yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Could you tell me what your impression was of who had 
won the fight and who had lost the fight? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Calls for speculation. Lack of 
foundation.

inform O.J. that I wasn't going to the Rose Bowl.  He said he -- that 
he was going. 
 
Q: Simpson told you he was going? 
 
A: Yeah, he was still going to the Rose Bowl. 
 
Q: He did go, didn't he? 
 
A: Yeah, as far as I know. 
 
Q: Okay.  Who did you see when you went back to [Name 
Deleted] 's house again?  
 
A: I don't remember. It could have been, I guess -- I don't know.  
People could have been up by then. 
 
Q: Did you see [Name Deleted] again when you went back there? 
 
A: Yes, I saw [Name Deleted], yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you have any conversations with him?

she was pissed off.

you? 
 
A: Just said that O.J. was talking a lot, babbling. 
 
Q: Did he tell you what Simpson was babbling about? 
 
A: No.  Just like he -- [Name Deleted] said he didn't make any 
sense. 
 
Q: What did you say? 
 
A: Well, there was nothing to say.  He said it.  I just stood there. 
 
Q: What, if anything -- Did you talk to Simpson when you went 
back there again?

Q: Did he call the Browns, if you know? 
 
A: Not that I know of. 
 
Q: Did he say anything to indicate to you he had any concern for 
Nicole's health after you told him her head was hurting? 
 
A: I felt that he was concerned. 
 
Q: "Why did you feel that?" 
 
A: By the look on his face. 
 
Q: Did he say anything? 
 
A: No.  Seemed like he had a sad look on his face. 
 
Q: Did he say anything? 
 
A: Not that I remember, no. 
 
Q: Did he call Wayne Hughes while you were there at [Name 
Deleted] 's? 
 
A: They did talk.  I don't know if -- I don't know if I called Wayne 
back or if O.J. called Wayne.  They did talk while --  
 
Q: Did you tell Wayne that the police had been called to 
Rockingham? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did -- when you went back there this last time to [Name 
Deleted] 's, did Simpson indicate to you he had already spoken to 
Hughes? 
 
A: No. Uh-uh. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did he call Wayne Hughes then after you had told him 
you weren't going to the Rose Bowl? 
 
A: Pardon? 
 
Q: Do you know whether Simpson called Wayne Hughes after you 
told Simpson you weren't going to the Rose Bowl? 
 
A: I don't remember if he called him. 
 
Q: When you talked to Wayne Hughes, did Hughes indicate to you 
that he had already spoke to Simpson? 
 
A: I don't remember if he did or not. 
 
Q: Okay. What happened next after you went back end told 
Simpson you weren't going to the Rose Bowl? 
 
A: I just said I was going to stay around the area, and if Nicole 
needed me, that I'll be there for her, so --  
 
Q: What did he say? 
 
A: He said, "Will you take me by the house?"  So I said, "Okay." 
 
Q: And did you? 
 
A: Yes, I did. 
 
Q: Did he say why he wanted to go by the house? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Had Simpson taken a shower yet?  
 
A: Not that I know of. 
 
Q: Can you tell me what clothes he was wearing at that time? 
 
A: I don't remember what clothes he had on. 
 
Q: When he asked you to take him by Rockingham, was he 
appropriately dressed to go to the Rose Bowl at that time? 
 
A: I don't remember what O.J. had on. 
 
Q: Do you remember whether he even had shoes on? 
 
A: I didn't look at his whole attire.  I just assumed, you know, he 
was dressed. What he had on was shoes.  If he had on tennis shoes 
or street shoes, I don't know. 
 
Q: Okay. You drove him back to Rockingham then? 
 
A: Yes, we drove and we came up -- and he wanted me to go -- 
come up Bristol and come back -- go north on Bristol, turn left, 
west, and come south back down Rockingham, about two blocks 
up. 
 
Q: Why was that? 
 
A: At that time he was telling me that the police -- he felt that the 
police were still looking for him. 
 
Q: Okay. Were you checking to see if the police were parked out 
front?  Is that why you took that route? 
 
A: When I got there I realized, yeah that's the reason why. 
 
Q: Okay. Did he tell you that? 
 
A: I saw a police car. 
 
Q: Parked in front? 
 
A: It had pulled -- I don't know if he had just pulled up or how long 
he had been there, but it was at the gate on Rockingham. 
 
Q: What, if anything, did you do when you saw the police car? 
 
A: He asked me to take him back down to [Name Deleted]'s.

A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you have a -- did you have a car phone at that time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you have a cellular phone at that time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Simpson have a cellular phone with him? 
 
A: I didn't see one. 
 
Q: Okay. Other than him asking you -- other than Simpson asking 
you to take him back to [Name Deleted] 's, what else did he say to 
you after he saw the police? 
 
A: He was going to the Rose Bowl.  He was getting ready -- the 
game -- I don't know what time it started, but he was preparing -- I 
don't know if he drove over to Wayne's or Wayne came there to get 
him, because I think I left. 
 
Q: Okay. So when you left, Nicole's head was hurting.  Is that 
correct? 
 
A: When I left? 
 
Q: Rockingham. 
 
A: Yes, the second time, she said her head was hurting. 
 
Q: Okay. And she was still visibly upset. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And Mr. Simpson knew the police were looking for him 
at that time. 
 
A: Yeah, that's the impression that I got. 
 
Q: Okay. And you told Mr. Simpson that Nicole's head hurt at that 
time. 
 
A: Uh-huh. Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And he told you he was going to the Rose Bowl. 
 
A: He didn't -- I didn't say that -- he didn't say when I said her head 
was hurting, "Oh, I'm going to the Rose Bowl." 
 
Q: But he knew her head was hurting at that time. 
 
A: When I told him, yes. 
 
Q: And you told him you weren't going because you were too upset 
about what had happened already. 
 
A: And I was going to stay for her if she needed me. 
 
Q: Okay. And he was going to go to the Rose Bowl. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: Eventually he did. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did he tell you he was going to the Rose Bowl? 
 
A: He went to the Rose Bowl. If he decided then and there, I don't 
know.  If he decided within the conversation between him and 
Wayne to go, I don't know. 
 
Q: He never told you he wasn't going to the Rose Bowl, did he? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. What happened after you took Simpson back to [Name

remember.

A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you watch the Rose Bowl on TV that day? 
 
A: I probably did.  I eventually did go back over to Alan's, so I 
probably did watch the Rose Bowl from Alan's house. 
 
Q: Is that your recollection, that you watched the Rose Bowl at 
Alan's house that day? 
 
A: Yes, I think so.

you have any further conversation with [Name Deleted] about what 
had happened earlier that day? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Could you tell me what you said to [Name Deleted] ? 
 
A: [Name Deleted] was telling me how, you know, O.J. was 
looking nervous, scared.  I think his lips had dried out, like white 
lips or something like that, and he just said O.J. was just talking. 
 
Q: Was it in your opinion unusual behavior for Simpson, from 
what you had observed? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Did [Name Deleted]  indicate that it was unusual, the 
way Simpson was acting, also? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  What else did the two of you talk about?   Did you talk 
about the fact the police were looking for Simpson? 
 
A: I think so.  Probably did.  We talked about how -- [Name 
Deleted] said, "Well, how could it happen?  We was having so 
much fun, and we were having a good time at the party. What 
happened when they got home?"  I said, "I really don't know." 
 
Q: Did he tell you what happened? 
 
A: Who? 
 
Q:  [Name Deleted] . 
 
A: No. I don't think [Name Deleted] knew what happened. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you see [Name Deleted] that day? 
 
A: Could have. 
 
Q: Did you talk to her at all about what had happened early that 
morning? 
 
A: I could have talked to her briefly. 
 
Q: Do you recall in general terms what you may have talked to her 
about? 
 
A: No, I can't. 
 
Q: Okay.  Who else was over at [Name Deleted] 's besides [Name 
Deleted] and [Name Deleted] ? 
 
A: I really don't know. I don't know who was there. 
 
Q: Do you know how Simpson got any of the clothes he wore to 
the Rose Bowl that day? 
 
A: No, I don't. 
 
Q: Do you know whether he had gone back to Rockingham at all 
prior to going to the Rose Bowl? 
 
A: No, I don't. 
 
Q: Did anybody tell you he had gone back there at all prior to 
going back to the Rose Bowl?

Q: Were you still there?

Q: Okay. How long after the game ended did Simpson show up at 
[Name Deleted] 's? 
 
A: It was dark.  7:00, 7:30, somewhere right in there, I guess. 
 
Q: That's a 1:00 o'clock game, isn't it? 
 
A: It could have been a 3:00 o'clock game.  Sometimes the Rose 
Bowl is played at 3:00 for the East Coast. So it would be 1:00 
o'clock -- no. It could have been 1:00.  It could have been 3:00.  I 
really don't know. 
 
Q: Okay.  But you recall it was dark when he got home. 
 
A: It was dark. 
 
Q: Okay. What did you say when he -- I am sorry.  When he came 
back, who was at [Name Deleted] 's at that time? 
 
A: I don't remember if was just [Name Deleted] and I and his 
family or maybe some other people that was there. I really don't 
know. 
 
Q: Okay. And how long was Simpson at [Name Deleted] 's before 
he asked you to take him back to Rockingham? 
 
A: I don't know. He sit down, and I think he had a glass of water or 
a glass of juice or something like that.  It could have been a few 
minutes.  It could have been 10 minutes. 
 
Q: Did he seem nervous at that time? 
 
A: Seemed-seemed to be nervous. 
 
Q: Okay. And what did you do then when he asked you to take him 
to Rockingham? 
 
A: I guess I said okay, because we went. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you have any conversation on the way over there? 
 
A: I don't remember if we did or not. 
 
Q: Did you take the same route there that you had earlier that day 
when you drove him there? 
 
A: I think we could have.  You talking about the second time I took 
him? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Yes, I think we did. 
 
Q: Okay. And when you approached the front gates, did you see 
any police there that time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. So what happened next? 
 
A: Went into the house. 
 
Q: Did you go in with him, by the way? 
 
A: Yeah. Oh, yes. 
 
Q: Why do you say, "Oh, yes"? 
 
A: Because I wanted to be there. 
 
Q: Why? 
 
A: Because I didn't want nothing else to happen. 
 
Q: Why did you think something else might happen? 
 
A: It was just a precaution. 
 
Q: How was Simpson acting at that time? 
 
A: He was calm. 
 
Q: Okay. Did he ask you to come in the house with him? 
 
A: No, I don't know if he did or not.  
 
Q: Did he tell you not to come in the house with him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. What happened next? 
 
A: We walked in. Nicole was in the kitchen sitting down, and she 
was feeding the baby and --  
 
Q: Just one baby? 
 
A: She was feeding a baby. I don't know if she was feeding two or 
one.  She was feeding-- 
 
Q: Let me ask you, Sydney was about three and a half at this time. 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: And Justin was just several months old.  Do you recall seeing 
Nicole in the  kitchen with both the children at any time? 
 
A: I don't remember. All I know, she was holding a child.  It could 
have...  
 
Q: I am listening.  Is that the end of your answer? 
 
A: No. I mean, she was -- she could have been feeding Justin. 
 
Q: Okay.  What happened next? 
 
A: O.J. was trying to talk to Nicole. 
 
Q: How was he trying to talk to her? 
 
A: Calmly or -- I don't know.  He was saying he was sorry. 
 
Q: What did he say he was sorry for? 
 
A: He didn't go into details. He just, you know, apologized. 
 
Q: Did Nicole apologize to him? 
 
A: Nicole didn't say anything. 
 
Q: Did she say she was sorry to him? 
 
A: She didn't say anything. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: I don't know how much -- I don't know how long we were there, 
and she said -- I said, "Nicole, are you feeling okay?" And I noticed 
there was some "swelling somewhere around -- it could have been 
on this side (Indicating) or it could have been on that side 
(Indicating), and I said -- 
 
Q: Are you indicating directly above one of her eyes? 
 
A: Yeah, I think, yeah, in that area, somewhere in that area. 
 
Q: And I said, "Nicole are you all right?"  And she said, "My head 
hurts." I said, "Nicole, why don't you let me take you to the 
hospital." And she said, "No."  
 
Q: I said, "Nicole, you know, you may have a concussion, and the 
worst thing you can do is to go to sleep." 
 
And then O.J. said something about, "Baby, you should let A.C 
take you to the hospital." 
 
Q: What did she say to him when he said that? 
 
A: She didn't reply to him.  And I asked her again, and she said -- I  
said, "Come on, Nic, let's go." 
 
Q: And what did she say? 
 
A: She said, "Okay." 
 
Q: Did Simpson tell you to take her to the hospital? 
 
A: He suggested that she should go to the hospital with me. 
 
Q: I am sorry. I didn't hear you.  He --  
 
A: When I asked her and she refused, he says -- I think he said, 
"Baby, you should let A.C take you to the hospital." 
 
Q: And that was the only suggestion he made to her? 
 
A: As far as I can remember, yes. 
 
Q: Did you see her looking for any aspirin at that time? 
 
A: I don't know if she took anything.  She didn't look for aspirins 
then. 
 
Q: Did she ask you for any aspirin? 
 
A: Not that I can remember, no. 
 
Q: Did she indicate to you she was looking for aspirin? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you were in the kitchen earlier that day when she was 
feeding the baby also, that morning, did she indicate to you at that 
time she was looking for aspirin? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she indicate to you in that morning that she had a 
hangover? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she indicate to you that she had had too much to drink the 
night before? 
 
A: No, she didn't. 
 
Q: That evening when you were in the kitchen with Simpson, did 
she indicate to you that she had a hangover from the night before? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she indicate to you she had had too much to drink the night 
before? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was it your impression that the only reason she had to go to the 
hospital was because she had been hit the night before? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Calls for speculation.  Lack of 
foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: That I don't know. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Did she just stop what she was doing right then and go to 
the hospital? 
 
A: I think she -- I think she changed clothes, and she made 
arrangements -- 
 
Q: How did she make arrangements? 
 
A: For the babies.  I assume that Michelle was there --  
 
Q: Had you seen Michelle at all this entire day? 
 
A: I don't remember seeing Michelle. 
 
Q: But you never saw Michelle in the kitchen keeping an eye on 
Nicole? 
 
A: I don't remember seeing her.  Her room was off the kitchen.  
She could have been in her room. 
 
Q: But any time you were there, you never saw Michelle? 
 
A: I don't remember seeing her. 
 
Q: Okay. And both times you were there Nicole was taking care of 
the children? 
 
A: Yeah. I don't know if Sydney was somewhere -- I don't know if 
Sydney -- because Sydney had a tendency of laying on the couch 
right there and watch TV.  She would lay on her back.  It was like a 
cushion on a couch in the kitchen.  That was Sydney's favorite 
spot. 
 
Q: After Nicole went upstairs to get ready, what did she do with 
Justin, who she had been feeding? 
 
A: I don't know if he was asleep or she put him to bed or I don't 
know if she gave Justy to Michelle.  I really don't know. 
 
Q: Well, how long did you have to wait for Nicole before you 
could take her to the hospital? 
 
A: Not too long.  It was very short. 
 
Q: Was Simpson there also? 
 
A: He was still there. 
 
Q: I am sorry.  I didn't hear the --  
 
A: He was still there. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you have any conversation with him when Nicole 
was upstairs? 
 
A: Not that I remember. 
 
Q: Did he indicate to you he thought Nicole might have a 
concussion? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he indicate to you any concern that Nicole might have a 
concussion? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did he ever indicate to you that he thought Nicole had a 
hangover? 
 
A: He didn't say anything to me about that. 
 
Q: Did he say anything to you about Nicole having just drank too 
much the night before? 
 
A: Not at that time. Excuse me.  Not at that time. 
 
Q: Did he at any time? 
 
A: Yes, later on. 
 
Q: Later on that day? 
 
A: No.  A day later or it could have been two days later. 
 
Q: What did he tell you? 
 
A: That both of them had been drinking. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did anybody else come to the hospital besides you and 
Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you recall what hospital you went to? 
 
A: It was in Santa Monica.  I think it was St. John's. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you make any calls yourself before you took Nicole 
to the hospital? 
 
A: Not that I remember, no. 
 
Q: Did you ask Simpson to come to the hospital with you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he offer to come to the hospital with you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Nicole tell him not to come to the hospital with you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she indicate to you that she didn't want him coming to the 
hospital with her? 
 
A: No. 
 
 
Q: Did she indicate to him that she didn't want him coming to the 
hospital with her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he make any effort to get in the car with you when you 
were taking her to the hospital? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he indicate in anyway that he wanted to accompany her to 
the hospital? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she indicate in anyway to you that she did not want him to 
accompany her to the hospital? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay, why don't we break here for lunch.

EXAMINATION (Resumed) 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Good afternoon, Mr. Cowlings.  When you took Nicole to the 
hospital, did anybody else accompany you --  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- to the hospital?  And do you remember the name of the 
hospital you went to? 
 
A: I think it was St. John's. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: In Santa Monica. 
 
Q: And do you recall approximately what time that was that you 
went there? 
 
A: It was in the evening time. 
 
Q: Okay. And did you have any conversation with Nicole when 
you were going to the hospital? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what did you say to her? 
 
A: She was doing most of the talking. 
 
Q: And what was she saying? 
 
A: About how bad she felt and how O.J. hit her and that she 
wanted him to pay for it. 
 
Q: When you say "how bad she felt," do you mean how bad she 
felt physically? 
 
A: She didn't tell me that she felt -- that she just felt bad.  That she 
felt bad.  Probably physically and mentally, too. 
 
Q: Okay.  And other than saying that she felt bad and that O.J. had 
hit her, what else did she tell you? 
 
A: She expressed to me then the reason that the fight started. 
 
Q: Did she tell you on the way to the hospital how many times O.J. 
had hit her? 
 
A: I don't remember if she did or not.  No, I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did she tell you on the way to the hospital if O.J. had slapped 
her? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did she tell you on the way to the hospital that O.J. had kicked 
her? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did she tell you on the way to the hospital that O.J. had choked 
her? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did she tell you on the way to the hospital again that O.J. had 
pulled her hair? 
 
A: No, I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay.  And what did she tell you in terms of how, as you term 
it, a fight -- the fight started? 
 
A: Her words to me were that she "wouldn't f--- him." 
 
Q: That's all she told you? 
 
A: She didn't go into details, but that's what she said. 
 
Q: Okay.  And did she tell you what he did when that occurred? 
 
A: An argument started, I guess. 
 
Q: And did she tell you what happened after the argument? 
 
A: I can't remember what happened after that.  She went back to, "I 
want him to pay for this." 
 
Q: She was still angry that evening as you spoke to her? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And did she say how he wanted her to pay -- how she 
wanted him to pay for it? 
 
A: No, she didn't say directly how.  She just kept saying that she 
wanted him to pay for it and that, you know, she was hurt, and I 
think she said something about her being a victim, and she was 
concerned that everybody was going to side with O.J. 
 
Q: Did she tell me -- did she tell you how many times in the past 
this had happened? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did she tell you this had ever happened in the past? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she tell you this was the first time it had happened? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: What else did she tell you during the ride to the hospital? 
 
A: I said, "Nicole, if you gonna do it, you got to go all the way." 
 
Q: And what did you mean by that? 
 
A: Well, if she was going to press charges or do what she said. 
 
Q: Did she tell you she was going to press charges? 
 
A: No.  I just -- she didn't say "charge."  She just said that she 
wanted him hurt; she wanted to get even, and I said, "Well," I said, 
"you know, you gotta go all the way." 
 
Q: And what did you mean by that? 
 
A: I think it was more of letting her know that, you know, I was 
not trying to talk her out of it.  I felt what he did was wrong and it 
shouldn't have never happened, and I was supporting her. 
 
Q: As you rode to the hospital in that car, what did you know that 
Simpson had done that was wrong, in your mind? 
 
A: Well, I don't think any man should hit a woman. 
 
Q: Okay.  And what did you do when you got to the hospital then? 
 
A: We walked into the emergency room, and she -- we walked up 
to the counter or whatever, you know, to admission or whatever, 
and the lady asked her her name.  Then I don't know if Nicole -- I 
don't know if she -- what she said what was bothering her, I mean, 
physically was bothering her, but -- 
 
Q: Right. 
 
A: -- the lady said, "How did you sustain your injuries?" 
 
Q: This is at the front desk still? 
 
A: Yes, at the -- the lady that's filling out the forms. 
 
Q: And what did Nicole say? 
 
A: Nicole kinda like hesitated a little bit, and I don't -- she 
mumbled something or she said something.  I don't remember.  
And she looked at me and I said, "Nicole, you got to tell them the 
truth." 
 
Q: Do you recall Nicole having trouble speaking during this day, 
New Year's Day? 
 
A: No. No. 
 
Q: Did she ever complain about her jaw hurting at all? 
 
A: I don't remember if she did. 
 
Q: Okay.  So after you said that to Nicole, what did she do then? 
 
A: She said -- I don't know if she said, "I was hit" or "I had a fight" 
or "I was beaten."  I don't remember exactly what her words were. 
 
Q: Okay.  And did the person at the desk ask her anything else 
after that? 
 
A: Probably. 
 
Q: Did you hear her say anything? 
 
A: I guess she had to give her address and probably what time, 
general information, I would think. 
 
Q: Okay.  After this information was given at the front desk, how 
long did you have to wait there in the reception area? 
 
A: I don't know.  I really don't.  I really don't know.  It wasn't like 
five minutes, no. 
 
Q: Do you know approximately how long it was before Nicole 
even saw a doctor? 
 
A: No, I don't. 
 
Q: Can you approximate for me? 
 
A: She went -- they took her to the back or wherever. They went 
back there. 
 
Q: Right after you checked in there, they took her back? 
 
A: After they got the information. 
 
Q: Okay.  By the way, on the car ride over there, did Nicole say 
anything about divorce? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did she say anything about the kids? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you see Ruth at all that day when you were over at the 
house? 
 
A: I don't remember who was there, to be honest with you. 
 
Q: But you don't remember seeing Ruth at all? 
 
A: No.  Like I said, she could have been there.  I just don't 
remember. 
 
Q: Mr. Cowlings, I am going to ask you to look at this picture.  It's 
been previously marked as Exhibit No. 45.  Ask you if you 
recognize that picture. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Which exhibit number? 
 
MR. KELLY: 45. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: And who do you recognize that to be? 
 
A: Nicole. 
 
Q: And does that appear to be the way that Nicole looked when 
you went over there that early morning time to Rockingham --  
 
A: Hey, man, can you give me a break? 
 
Q: Yes.  Off the record. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the 
time is approximately 1:50. 
 
(Recess.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 1:56. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Mr. Cowlings, I had asked you previously to look at that exhibit 
that's been marked Exhibit No. 45, and I will ask you again if you 
recognize the person depicted in that photo. 
 
A: Yes, I do. 
 
Q: And who is that? 
 
A: It's Nicole. 
 
Q: And do you recognize the black jacket she has on in that 
picture? 
 
A: Is that a jacket?  It's black.  I assume that's the jacket that she 
had on. 
 
Q: Do you recognize that as the police jacket she had when you 
went over there early that morning? 
 
A: It's black.  I mean, I can't determine if it's a jacket or not, but it's 
black. 
 
Q: Does it appear to be what she had on when you went over there 
that morning? 
 
A: Yes, it's black, yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And as she is depicted in that photo, is that the way 
Nicole appeared to you as you arrived there at Rockingham the 
first time on New Year's morning, 1989? 
 
A: Her hair wasn't back like that when I saw  her. 
 
Q: Other than her hair being back, does her face appear to be the 
same as it was when you saw her when you walked in the kitchen 
that morning New Year's Day? 
 
A: It looks like it's red.  That's what I detected on her face: Being 
red. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you recognize any other of the markings that are on 
her face in that photo? 
 
A: Not -- no. Uh-uh. 
 
Q: Do you recognize the large lump and bruise appearing over her 
right eye? 
 
A: Are you looking at the same picture I am? 
 
Q: No.  I am talking about the one you're looking at. 
 
A: Over her right eye? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: I noticed that later on.  I didn't notice that right off the bat, I 
mean my first visit there. 
 
Q: Okay.  And with regard to the bruise and swelling under her 
right eye and her right cheek, did you recognize that that morning 
when you went over there? 
 
A: No, I didn't. 
 
Q: Okay.  With regard -- would you agree with me that there appear 
to be scratches on her face in that photograph? 
 
A: Yes, it does. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall seeing those scratches on her face when 
you went over there the first time that morning to Rockingham on 
New Year's Day? 
 
A: Well, like I said, I noticed the redness in her face.  I didn't zero 
in to find out -- I mean to see if there were scratches or anything.  I 
just noticed her face was red. 
 
Q: Okay.  Well, looking at that photograph before you now, do you 
recall her having a lump and bruise over her right eye? 
 
A: Not that first morning, no. 
 
Q: And looking at that photograph now, does it refresh your 
recollection that she had a bruise and swollen right cheek that 
morning that first time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Looking at that photograph, does that refresh your recollection 
as to whether or not she had scratches on her face when you arrived 
there that first morning on New Year's Day, 1989? 
 
A: I didn't notice the scratches.  Like I said, I noticed her face 
being red. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: As we were standing there talking, Nicole was -- I think was 
fixing herself some tea or drinking some water, and she was in a 
huff, and she was like, you know, moving around, so I didn't zero 
in on just having her stand still and examine her.  I just noticed her 
face was red. 
 
Q: Okay. I am going to ask you to look at what has been previously 
marked as Exhibit 46 now, and do you recognize that photograph? 
 
A: Yes, I know -- yes, I recognize the photograph. 
 
Q: Okay.  Could you tell me who that photograph depicts? 
 
A: It's Nicole. 
 
Q: And do you recognize her appearance as that being her 
appearance when you arrived there that morning on New Year's 
Day, 1989? 
 
A: Her hair is back.  I didn't notice this that morning. 
 
Q: Okay. Would you agree with me now as you look at that 
photograph that she has a very large and swollen bruise over her 
right eye? 
 
A: Yes, it is. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you notice that that morning when you went over 
there to Rockingham? 
 
A: No, I didn't, sir. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you notice that that night when you took her to the 
hospital? 
 
A: Yes, I did. 
 
Q: And in fact when you took her to the hospital that night, it was 
even larger and darker than it appears in that photograph there, was 
it not? 
 
A: It seemed like it was larger.  It could have been darker.  Like I 
say, she didn't have her hair pulled back, but I noticed that it was 
swelling.  And when she was telling me that she was bothered by a 
headache, I felt that, you know, it would be wise for her to go to 
the hospital because I didn't want her to go to sleep, you know, 
thinking that maybe she had a   concussion. 
 
Q: That was a rather substantial injury she had over her right eye 
that day on New Year's Day, was it not, Mr. Cowlings? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to "substantial."  Vague. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know, sir.  She stated to me that you 
know, her head was hurting, and I was concerned for her well-
being. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did you feel there was reason to be concerned about it, with the 
appearance of her head when you looked at it? 
 
A: She was hurting.  She said her head was hurting. 
 
Q: I am asking you: When you looked at her head, her forehead, 
and saw what was there, did you think there was reason to be 
concerned about her health at that time? 
 
A: When Nicole told me her head was hurting, I was concerned on 
her reply. 
 
Q: Were you concerned about the appearance of her head when 
you looked at it? 
 
A: When Nicole told me that her head was bothering her, that put 
my concern that maybe this was a concussion of some kind. 
 
Q: That what was a concussion? 
 
A: That with the knot and her head hurting was tied in together. 
 
Q: Okay. What I am asking you, Mr. Cowlings, again: Did it cause 
you concern, you yourself concern, after you observed that knot on 
her head that day, New Year's Day, 1989? 
 
A: That night when I came back over and noticed the knot, she was 
telling me her head was bothering her.  That raised my concern.  I 
said,  "Nicole, let me take you to the hospital." 
 
Q: Okay.  Would it be fair to say that the fact that she had that knot 
and Mr. Simpson -- and she told you Mr. Simpson had hit her also 
caused you concern for her health that day? 
 
A: She didn't tell me where O.J. hit her.  She didn't tell me he hit 
her upside the head or he hit her on top of her head or he hit her on 
the jaw.  She just told me she was hit by him. 
 
Q: After she had told you that Simpson had hit her, did you draw 
your own conclusion as to where he had hit her?  And I will ask 
you to look at that photo --  
 
A: There was --  
 
Q: -- again, Mr. Cowlings. 
 
A: I would -- it seemed like it was a hit to me.  I would assume -- I 
shouldn't assume, because I wasn't there.  I don't know how these 
blows were thrown. 
 
Q: Was it your impression at least one of the blows hit Nicole right 
in the front forehead over her right eye? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Calls for speculation --  
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know --  
 
MR.LEONARD: -- lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: -- I wasn't there.  I'm sorry. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: I understand you weren't there Mr. Cowlings.  What I am asking 
you, if in your opinion after talking to Nicole it was your opinion 
that Simpson had hit her in the front of the forehead above her 
right eye? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.  Asking him to 
speculate. 
 
THE WITNESS: She never told me that he hit her in the head.  
Verbally, she never actually told me how he hit her. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: She told you that he hit her, though? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And she told the people at the hospital he hit her also, didn't 
she? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: I think so, yes. She -- when she asked her -- the 
lady asked her what had happened and she delayed, she finally 
said, "I was hit."  How she told them how she was hit, I don't know 
because she was taken in the back to be examined. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Mr. Cowlings, you played high school football? 
 
A: Yes, I did. 
 
Q: College football? 
 
A: Yes, I did. 
 
Q: Pro football? 
 
A: Yes, I did. 
 
Q: Seen a lot of injuries in your day?  
 
A: Yes, I have. 
 
Q: Seen people with head injuries? 
 
A: Bumps, bruises. 
 
Q: Seen people with knots on their heads? 
 
A: Not directly during a game, but some time afterwards. I've had 
knots I didn't realize I had until a day later. 
 
Q: Have you ever seen a knot this big on someone's forehead 
before? 
 
A: Probably have. 
 
Q: Do you remember that specifically? 
 
A: I was in a contact sport.  I've seen a lot. 
 
Q: You've seen a lot of contact injuries? 
 
A: Yes, I have, sir. 
 
Q: Does that look like a contact injury to you? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: It could be. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Are you able to answer the question as you sit here today when 
I ask you, does that in you opinion appear to be where Nicole 
Brown Simpson got hit early that morning on New  Year's Day? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.  Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Sir, I can only tell you what I know for a fact: 
That I don't know how she sustained that injury.  She could have 
been hit by O.J.  She could have hit her head up against the wall, 
sir.  There's a number of ways you can get a knot up on your head.   
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did she tell you Simpson threw her against a wall? 
 
A: No, she didn't. 
 
Q: Did she tell you anything else he did to her besides hit her? 
 
A: She didn't go into details to me. 
 
Q: Do you think it would be fair to conclude that she got hit in the 
head, just from her appearance that morning? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Calls for speculation.  Lack of 
foundation. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: You can answer it. 
 
A: She did get hit in the head some kind of way. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall seeing the bruise under her right eye that 
morning when you went to Rockingham? 
 
A: Where is the bruise?  Where are you speaking of? 
 
Q: (Indicating).  Would you agree with me even that there is a 
bruise on her right cheek? 
 
A: I'm not trying to make excuses here.  Nicole has keen cheeks, so 
I don't know.  I couldn't tell you if that's swollen or if that's 
Nicole's cheek. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What kind of cheeks? 
 
THE WITNESS: She's very keen in the face, very structured.  So I 
don't know if that's swollen or if that's her natural shape of her 
face. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall seeing any of those -- Would you agree that 
there are some scratches that appear in that photograph? 
 
A: Yes, sir. 
 
Q: Do you recall seeing those scratches that morning when you 
went over to Rockingham the first time? 
 
A: That could have been the red flush or discoloration of her face 
what I was noticing.  I wasn't standing directly up on Nicole. 
 
Q: Okay.  Were you face to face with Nicole the second time you 
went there that morning and you saw her feeding Justin? 
 
A: She was -- she had her head down, you know, doing her routine 
with the baby, and she wasn't too talkative.  I just was more 
concerned if she needed anything or whatever, and I didn't stay that 
long, so I really didn't get a good look at Nicole. 
 
Q: Did you notice any injuries on her face at all at that time? 
 
A: Her face still seemed to be red. 
 
Q: Other than red, did you notice anything else about it? 
 
A: Pardon? 
 
Q: Other than her face being red, did you notice anything else 
about it? 
 
A: No, I don't. 
 
Q: Okay.  This is Exhibit No. 47.  Do you recognize that 
photograph, Mr. Cowlings? 
 
A: Yes. I do. 
 
Q: Could you tell me who that photograph depicts? 
 
A: It's Nicole. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you recognize the sweat pants she's wearing in that 
picture? 
 
A: Yes, I do. 
 
Q: Okay.  Were those the sweat pants she had on when you first 
arrived at Rockingham that morning of New Year's Day, 1989? 
 
A: Yes, they are. 
 
Q: Okay.  Now, in looking at that photograph, does that refresh 
your recollection whether those pants were dirty at all when you 
went over there that morning? 
 
A: They were dirty. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do those pants appear to be in the same condition as 
they were when you first arrived there that morning on New Year's 
Day, 1989? 
 
A: They appear to be. 
 
Q: Okay.  And the jacket she has on, is that the jacket you recall 
that she was wearing when you first arrived there? 
 
A: Yes, sir. 
 
Q: Okay.  I am going to ask you to look at Exhibit No. 49.  Do you 
recognize -- I'm sorry, Dan.  Do you recognize that photograph? 
 
A: Yes, I do. 
 
Q: And could you tell me who is depicted in that photograph? 
 
A: Nicole. 
 
Q: And in looking at that, does Nicole appear in that photograph as 
the way she appeared to you that day that you arrived in 
Rockingham on New Year's Day, 1989? 
 
A: This is close to what I pictured when I saw her with the redness 
in her face. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall seeing the -- Would you agree with me, 
first of all, that there is a knot or lump above her right eye in that 
photograph? 
 
A: There seems to be a knot with some red breaking of the skin -- I 
mean skin being broken. 
 
Q: Do you see bruising there also? 
 
A: Somewhat, yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And do you recall seeing that at any time during the day 
on New Year's Day, 1989? 
 
A: I noticed that that evening. 
 
Q: Okay.  And would you agree with me that there are scratches 
that appear on Nicole's face in that photograph? 
 
A: Yes, sir. 
 
Q: Do you recall seeing those that evening when you took her to 
the hospital? 
 
A: I don't remember.  I don't know if I -- I was more concerned 
with the knot and her complaining about her head, sir. 
 
Q: How do you -- In your experience, what usually causes a 
concussion? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.  Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: My impression, something in contact with the 
head. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. So it's a contact injury, is it not? 
 
A: Could be.  Some type of force has to be delivered. 
 
Q: Okay.  It's not a pressure injury, if you know what I mean by 
that.  Do you? 
 
A: No, I don't.  What do you mean by "pressure"? 
 
Q: Well, it's not just (Indicating).  Can you get a concussion from 
your head just being squeezed? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection --  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: If you know. 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Lack of foundation.  Speculation. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Have you in your experience heard of a concussion being 
caused any other way other than by a blow to the head? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: What I am asking you, you in your experience as a professional 
athlete, have you ever heard of a concussion being caused by 
anything other than a blow to the head? 
 
A: You can have a concussion getting hit in the head or the jaw. 
 
Q: I am sorry? 
 
A: You can suffer a concussion by getting  hit in the jaw. 
 
Q: Okay. Any other way? 
 
A: I don't -- I'm not a medical person. 
 
Q: I understand that. 
 
A: I wouldn't know if there's any other way to get a concussion. 
 
Q: Okay.  But in your experience those are the only ways that you 
know of that you could suffer a concussion? 
 
A: To me a concussion is when you bump your head or get hit by 
something. 
 
Q: Okay.  In the head. 
 
A: The head, side of the face of the temple area or the jaw.  The 
jaw is connected. 
 
Q: You can't get a concussion from drinking too much, can you? 
 
A: I don't know.  I've never been that drunk to pass out. 
 
Q: But I am saying: Just by consuming alcohol, you can't get a 
concussion, as far as you know? 
 
A: I wouldn't know, sir. 
 
Q: Okay.  I am going to ask you to look at Exhibit No.50.  Do you 
recognize that photograph? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And could you tell me who is depicted in that photograph? 
 
A: That's Nicole. 
 
Q: And could you tell -- are you able to make any observations as 
to her upper right arm? 
 
A: I never saw her upper right arm. 
 
Q: I am asking --  
 
A: I never saw this.  Are you asking me -- 
 
Q: I am asking you what you see in that  picture right there. 
 
A: Oh, her arm is black and blue. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you have any idea what caused  that black-and-blue 
injury on her right arm? 
 
A: I have no knowledge of that. 
 
Q: Looking at that black-and-blue injury in her upper right arm, 
does her face appear to be the same as it appeared that day, New 
Year's Day, 1989, when you took her to the hospital? 
 
A: That morning I would say it seems to be, like I said, red.  You 
know, it could have been the scratches that I had saw. 
 
Q: Okay.  But other than that, that's the way you recall her 
appearing that morning? 
 
A: Yeah, somewhat, yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you ever speak to Ron Shipp at all on New Year's 
Day? 
 
A: Not -- no.  I don't think so. 
 
Q: Did Mr. Simpson tell you he had spoken to Ron Shipp at all on 
New Year's Day? 
 
A: No, I didn't -- no, I don't know that. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Are you talking about '89? 
 
MR. KELLY: Yeah. 
 
Q: Did you speak to Mr. Kardashian at all on New Year's Day, 
1989? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you talk to Skip Taft at all that day, New Year's Day, 1989? 
 
A: I could have spoken to Skip.  Skip could have been over to 
Alan's.  I don't know for sure if he was there. 
 
Q: Do you have any recollection of discussing this incident since 
that meeting at -- the injuries Nicole received, with Skip Taft on 
New Year's Day, 1989? 
 
A: I don't remember that. 
 
Q: Did you ever discuss this with Skip Taft? 
 
A: I don't remember that either. 
 
Q: Did you ever discuss that particular New Year's Day, 1989 
incident with Robert Kardashian? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever discuss this incident with Ron Shipp? 
 
A: Not that I know of. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall how long you were at the hospital with 
Nicole for? 
 
A: I don't know how long it took for them to examine her. You 
know, I wasn't timing it, so I don't know. 
 
Q: You weren't with her when she spoke to the doctors? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  What did she tell you when she came out of the 
examining room afterwards? 
 
A: I don't remember.  I mean, she could have said we could go, or I 
said, "What did they say?"  I don't know if they gave her any 
medication or anything.  I don't know for sure. 
 
Q: Did you take her to a drugstore that you remember? 
 
A: I don't think so.  I don't remember taking her to a drugstore. 
 
Q: Okay.  Then you took her home then? 
 
A: Yes, I did. 
 
Q: Did you have any further conversation in the car on the way 
home? 
 
A: I don't remember if we did or not. 
 
Q: Okay.  What did you do after you got her back home, if 
anything? 
 
A: Walked her in.  I don't know if she told me she was going to 
take a shower or she was going to bed.  I don't know -- remember 
what she said. 
 
Q: Did you stay there for a while? 
 
A: I stayed a little while, and then I told her if she needed me, to 
call me at home. 
 
Q: Did you go home then?  
 
A: Yes, I did. 
 
Q: Did you see anybody else there when you dropped her back off 
that day? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Do you know who was baby-sitting? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you then go home?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you talk to anybody that night after you got home? 
 
A: No, I don't remember if I did or not. 
 
Q: Did you talk to Simpson that night? 
 
A: I don't remember if I did or not. 
 
Q: Do you remember him calling you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: No, he did not call you? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.   
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember him calling me. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: When was the next time you talked to Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: I don't know if I did or not.  I kinda like left it alone and felt the 
best thing to do was to, you know, stay away.  So I don't know 
what  happened after then. 
 
Q: Was Simpson home when you brought Nicole home that night? 
 
A: I don't remember if he was. 
 
Q: He wasn't there waiting for her, was he? 
 
A: I don't remember, sir. 
 
Q: Do you remember him ever making a call to the emergency 
room when you were there? 
 
A: Not to my knowledge. 
 
Q: Okay.  And do you remember him ever calling you again to ask 
how Nicole was? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay. When was the next time you talked to Simpson? 
 
A: The time that I remembered I spoke with O.J., I was on my way 
to work and I stopped off normally I had a procedure where I get 
some coffee and a muffin and a newspaper, and it was an article in 
the paper. 
 
Q: Was that the following day? . 
 
A: I don't know if it was the following day.  Could have been the 
following week.  I stayed -- like I said, I stayed away for a while. 
 
Q: Do you remember Simpson ever calling you to ask how Nicole 
was after you had taken her to the hospital that night? 
 
A: I don't remember, sir. 
 
Q: Okay.  And what happened when you -- tell me about the --  
 
A: I thought things were -- no.  This I would think was a while ago.  
This was a period -- some time had developed. 
 
Q: Had you talked to Simpson at any time in the interim? 
 
A: I knew they had went to Hawaii on a trip for Hertz.  I don't 
know if it was a few days after that incident or a week or two 
weeks later, but they did make a trip to Hawaii that had something 
to do with Hertz, and I thought things were back to normal.  Like I 
said, I had stayed away, and whenever the article came out in the 
paper about Nicole filing charges, I called him and just wished him 
the best. 
 
Q: What did he say? 
 
A: He was taken by it. 
 
Q: By the fact that Nicole was filing charges? 
 
A: Well, from what he told me, the D.A.'s office pressured -- 
Nicole wanted to drop the charges. 
 
Q: Who told you Nicole wanted to drop the charges? 
 
A: He told me that. 
 
Q: Did Nicole tell you she wanted to drop the charges? 
 
A: No. I'm telling you O.J. told me that Nicole said she wanted -- I 
mean, he -- that morning he said Nicole wanted to drop the charges. 
 
Q: This morning you called him? 
 
A: Yeah, after the article had came out. 
 
Q: Okay.  Nicole never told you she wanted to drop charges, did 
she? 
 
A: No, she didn't, sir. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: He said that, but the-- some woman down at the D.A.'s office 
told Nicole that she had to. 
 
Q: And that's all he told you? 
 
A: He just, you know -- he said that they'll get through this.  
Everything was fine, you know. 
Q: Did he ever express any concern about his Hertz contract to 
you? 
 
A: He didn't directly tell me.  I had heard later on that it was 
important that Nicole go with him to Hawaii. 
 
Q: Was it your understanding that she had gone to Hawaii with 
him because of his contract with Hertz? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: It could have been a combination of things.  It 
could have been she was -- I mean, they went back together. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: When was the next time...Other than Simpson's contract with 
Hertz, can you think of any other reason she went to Hawaii with 
him? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know if that's the sole reason why she 
went.  I mean, like I said, they had been back together, and it 
wasn't uncommon for her to travel with him on business trips or 
trips like that. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  Well, is it fair to say that you had heard after the fact one 
of the reasons she did go with him to Hawaii was because of his 
Hertz contract? 
 
A: That was part of it. 
 
Q: What else had you heard? 
 
A: I just assumed that she was going with him anyway.  I mean, 
they were scheduled to go, to make the trip together, before this 
thing happened. 
 
Q: Okay.  When was the next time you spoke to Nicole? 
 
A: I stayed away just to let it blow over, and I think -- I think 
Denise -- maybe I saw her and Denise together.  Maybe I dropped 
by the house, and I think Denise stayed with her for a while, I 
think. 
 
Q: How long after New Year's Day was this that you stopped by 
the house? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Was it within two weeks? 
 
A: I don't remember, sir. 
 
Q: Did you talk to Nicole at all about the incident again?   
 
A: I was just glad to see that she was, you know, doing fine.  It 
seemed like, you know, things were back to normal between her 
and O.J. 
 
Q: Is that what she told you? 
 
A: That's my appearance -- that's what I figured myself.  I didn't ask 
her.  They were both living there together. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was there any time after this incident that you discussed 
this New Year's Day incident with Ron Shipp? 
 
A: I don't remember if I did or not.  Shipp was more of an 
acquaintance of O.J.'s and Nicole's.  I mean, he used to frequent 
their house a lot. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was Shipp a good friend of Simpson's? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: He was a friend. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Was he a good friend of Simpson's? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know how -- I know he was a friend.  
O.J.'s a very friendly person.  People come by his house a lot. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Well, it's your testimony that Ron Shipp was by the house a lot. 
 
A: Yes, he was. 
 
Q: Okay.  And going back as far as 1980 when Simpson first 
moved into the house, do you remember seeing Ron Shipp at the 
house back then? 
 
A: No, I don't. 
 
Q: As of 1985 when Simpson and Nicole got married, do you 
recall seeing Shipp around the house after that period? 
 
A: Could have been.  I think O.J. came in contact with Ron Shipp 
at Joe Stellini's.  I think that's where initially -- how they met, was 
at Stellini's. 
 
Q: Well, when did Simpson start hanging out at Stellini's? 
 
A: Ever since Joe had his restaurant. 
 
Q: That was back in the late '70s, wasn't it? 
 
A: I think Joe opened that restaurant in '78 or '79 or something like 
that I think. 
 
Q: Do you recall seeing Shipp at Stellini's with Simpson? 
 
A: I don't know what time frame, but eventually Shipp was there. 
 
Q: With Simpson? 
 
A: No.  He was there with himself or other people. 
 
Q: And Simpson also? 
 
A: I don't remember seeing O.J. there.  I remember Shipp 
introduced himself to me.  He said that I knew his cousin or his -- 
something connected up in  San Francisco or Northern California.  
I -- to this day I couldn't tell you who he was speaking of, but I just 
went along with it.  He seemed to be a nice guy. 
 
Q: In what time period did you used to see Shipp at Rockingham a 
lot? 
 
A: He would come by there while he was on duty as an officer. 
 
Q: Did you see him there after he had retired from the LAPD? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: A lot? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection to "a lot." Vague. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know what "a lot" is.  I mean, he was 
there.  We... 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did you ever play tennis with him there? 
 
A: No.  He played tennis with other people.  He used to -- he would 
bring his doubles team with him or the people he was going to play 
with, but I never played with him. 
 
Q: He would bring the other three people with him? 
 
A: Yeah, three, four, five, six people. 
 
Q: Did you ever see him playing tennis with Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever see him playing hoops there? 
 
A: It's a basketball court there.  He could have played. 
 
Q: Did you ever see him playing? 
 
A: I never watched Ron Shipp play tennis, so I don't know what he 
did after that. 
 
Q: Okay.  But you saw him there on a regular basis? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. "Regular basis."  Vague. 
 
THE WITNESS: He was there.  I don't know how regular it was, 
but he was there. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: And would it be fair to say that you saw him there I think you 
had said before "a lot"?  Could you tell me when the last time you 
saw him there was before June 12th, 1994? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the preamble "a lot."  I don't believe 
that was his testimony, and it's vague. 
 
THE WITNESS: I couldn't tell you. 
 
MR. KELLY: Preamble? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Yeah. 
 
MR. KELLY: That's a new one. 
 
Q: I'm sorry? 
 
A: I couldn't tell you that.  I wouldn't know when was the last time 
I saw Ron Shipp there. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you think you saw him there within the last six 
months prior to June 12th, 1994? 
 
A: I have no recollection of that. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall when Nicole moved to her Bundy 
condominium? 
 
A: Not really.  I didn't see a lot of O.J. and Nicole during that 
period.  It was a surprise to me that she moved -- I mean it 
surprised me --I remember she had told me that the lease was up at 
the Gretna Green place, but she continued to stay there.  I think she 
went on month to month. 
 
Q: Did you help her move out of Gretna Green? 
 
A: No, I didn't. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you help her move into Gretna Green? 
 
A: No. I teased her about that. 
 
Q: One of the times you didn't help her move? 
 
A: Right, that was one of the times.  And then we kinda had like a 
little, you know, joke about it. 
 
Q: Well, other than moving to Gretna Green and the one time you 
told me about her packing and going to Laguna, can you tell me 
other times you helped her pack and move? 
 
A: Well, I helped them pack and move a lot of things. When I say 
"help," it's a combination of when they bought their beach house in 
Laguna, I helped move stuff in, moved beds.  When they bought 
their condos, I helped to bring a lot -- she -- Nicole with her interior 
design business, she loved Kreiss Furniture.  Kreiss Furniture is a 
store out here that has like a Santa Fe look, and it's very heavy, a 
lot of stone and a lot of wood, and she would call for me or O.J., 
one of the two, to move stuff from one unit to the next or bring or 
take stuff down. 
 
Q: Did you ever have a key to Nicole's condo prior to her death on 
June 12th, 1994? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know whether Mr. -- I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Did you ever 
have a key to Nicole's condominium at 875 South Bundy prior to 
her death on June 12th, 1994? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know whether Mr. Simpson had a key to Nicole's 
condominium at 875 South Bundy prior to  her death on June 12th, 
1994? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did you ever have a key to Nicole's condo at 875 South Bundy?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Even after her death on June 12th, 1994? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know whether Mr. Simpson ever had a key to her condo 
after her death on June 12th, 1994? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: No, he did not? 
 
A: I didn't know if he had a key or not.  I mean, personally I didn't 
know if he had a key, no. 
 
Q: Okay.  You never had a key, though? 
 
A: No, I never had a key, sir. 
 
Q: To this day as we sit here? 
 
A: To this day as we sit here, I do not have a key to Nicole's condo 
on Bundy. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you ever go to her condominium at Bundy after her 
death? 
 
A: Yes, one time. 
 
Q: Okay.  You were up there on the 14th, were you not? 
 
A: It was -- 
 
MR. RE: Well, I'm afraid this was a period of time we are going to 
have to assert the Fifth Amendment.  Are you talking about June 
14th? 
 
MR. KELLY: Yes. 
 
MR. RE: Two days after the murder, yeah.  I am advising --  
 
MR. KELLY: I am going to ask him to assert it then. 
 
Q: Did you go up to Nicole's condo at 875 South Bundy on June 
14th, 1 994? 
 
A: What day was that? 
 
Q: That was two days after her death. 
 
A: What day? 
 
Q: It was Tuesday. 
 
MR. RE: Wait a second before you answer.  Let me talk to him for 
a minute, because there are certain areas you are obviously going 
to get into at this point regarding that time period.  Is that right? 
 
MR. KELLY: Just this specific issue for now. 
 
MR. RE: Which is? 
 
MR. KELLY: Let me ask you, Mr. Re, what is the basis for your 
refusal to allow your client to answer any questions, first of all, 
after June 17th, 1994? 
 
MR. RE: June 17th being the day of the arrest? 
 
MR. KELLY: The day of the arrest. 
 
MR. RE: No.  I limited it yesterday, so that we are only going up 
through the day of the arrest.  So in other words, the period of time 
is from the period of time that Mr. Simpson comes back from 
Chicago until the day of the arrest, as far as the time period is 
concerned. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. Previously, in fact yesterday for most of the 
day, your position had been for a two-week time period after June 
17th. 
 
MR. RE: We started off with the two-week time period because 
that seemed to be -- I had my time frame wrong, but towards the 
end of the day we kept saying up until the time of the two of their 
arrests.  That's the time we're talking about. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. So that's the time you intend to assert his 
Fifth Amendment right at this point? 
 
MR. RE: Right. There may be specific incidents within that one 
week -- roughly one-week period that we would not be asserting 
the privilege to. 
 
MR. KELLY: Do you want to take a break now and go over a 
couple of areas? 
 
MR. RE: With you? 
 
MR. KELLY: Or do you want me to ask the questions? 
 
MR. RE: Yeah, let's do it.  Let's do it.  I think that would be easier. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay, why don't we do that. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the 
time is approximately 2:31. 
 
(Recess.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 2:44. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Now, do you recall going up to 875 South Bundy, which was 
Nicole's condominium, on the morning of June 14th, 1994? 
 
A: It would have been in the afternoon. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall how you got up there? 
 
A: I drove. 
 
Q: Okay. Where did you drive from? 
 
A: I drove from Bob Kardashian's house. 
 
Q: Okay.  And how long had you been at Kardashian's house that 
day? 
 
THE WITNESS: On the advice of my lawyer, I respectfully refuse 
to answer on the grounds that the answer may tend to incriminate 
me. 
 
MR. RE: From now on may we have a stipulation that if he says he 
"asserts the privilege" or "the privilege," that he will have been 
deemed to have read that entire statement? 
 
MR. KELLY: That's fine. 
 
Q: Prior to your arrival at Kardashian's, where had you been? 
 
A: I was at the Brown's house. 
 
Q: Okay. And did you drive directly from Browns' to 
Kardashian's? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And was anybody with you when you drove to 
Kardashian's? 
 
A: The privilege. 
 
MR. KELLY: That's an even shorter version. 
 
MS. ROIT: Why don't you say "the Fifth." 
 
MR. RE: Just say "the privilege." We stipulate that he's read the 
entire statement. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
Q: What time did you drive from Kardashian's directly to the 
Bundy condominium? 
 
MR. RE: I am sorry. Was that one question or two? 
 
MR. KELLY: That was one, with a cough in between from your 
client.  I asked him if he drove directly from the Kardashian 
condominium to Nicole's condominium. 
 
MR. RE: Okay.  You started out saying "What time."  That's not 
part of the question? 
 
MR. KELLY: It's not now. 
 
MR. RE: Okay.  
 
Q: Did you drive directly from Mr. Kardashian's house to the 
condominium at 875 South Bundy? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was anybody with you at that time?  
 
A: No  
 
Q: Who, if anybody, was at the condominium when you arrived 
there?  
 
A: Lou Brown, Minnie Brown, Ralph, Ron --  
 
Q: Ron who? 
 
A: I don't know Ron.  He's a friend of Nicole's.  I don't know his 
last name. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: I think there was a maid there. 
 
Q: Do you remember her name? 
 
A: No.  I think she worked for Nicole.  And Cora came by. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you front -- did you park in front -- or where did you 
park when you arrived at the condominium? 
 
A: I pulled up to the front first because we had prearranged -- Lou 
knew I was coming. 
 
Q: I am sorry.  Who knew you were coming? 
 
A: Lou knew I was coming, and we had already prearranged that I 
was going to come and help pack up Nicole's stuff. 
 
Q: When had you arranged this?  
 
A: Before I left Laguna. 
 
Q: Do you know what arrangements Lou had made to get into the 
condominium at that time? 
 
A: I assume he had the keys. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did he tell you he had the keys? 
 
A: No.  He was upset because -- with the authorities because they 
left the door wide open. 
 
Q: Which door? 
 
A: I guess the front door. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: When I got there --  
 
Q: I am sorry. Did he tell you this when you were still down in 
Laguna? 
 
A: No.  It was after I got inside. 
 
Q: He told you that when he got there, the door was wide open? 
 
A: Once I got inside, he was kinda pissed off how they left the 
door open. 
 
Q: Which door?  Did he indicate? 
 
A: I would think the front door. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you come through the front door? 
 
A: I tried.  I don't know if the bell was working or I went -- I was 
trying -- hopefully I was trying to get them to see me, but I don't 
know if I got -- if Lou told me to go around or I went around the 
back, but I pulled -- I got back in my car because the press was 
starting to gather, and I got back in my car and I went around the 
back. 
 
Q: When you say the bell wasn't working, was that the bell outside 
the front gate? 
 
A: I don't know if I pressed the bell or just tried to get someone's 
attention inside that I was outside, but I couldn't -- some -- for some 
reason -- I don't know if Lou finally stepped out and said, "Go 
around the back," or motioned me to go around the back -- I know I 
eventually got back in my car and drove around the back. 
 
Q: But you weren't inside the gate --  
 
A: No. 
 
Q:-- in the front? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Did you -- 
 
A: In fact, let me correct that.  I never did go up to the gate.  I 
stood out on the sidewalk. 
 
Q: Did you observe blood on the front sidewalk at that time? 
 
A: I did not look at it. 
 
Q: Do you know whether it was there? 
 
A: Sir, I did not look at it. 
 
Q: Okay.  And where did you park around back when you went 
there? 
 
A: I pulled in and -- facing Nicole's garage, I pulled to the left, on 
the far left side.  Her car was there --  
 
Q: Which one?  The black --  
 
A: The black jeep.  I think that was her black jeep, or it could have 
been Minnie's black jeep, and her Ferrari was in the garage.  The 
garage door was up when I came around.  And when I got out, her 
next-door neighbor to the right said that if we needed to use his 
driveway or anything like that, don't hesitate, you know.  So --  
 
Q: Did you pull the car nose in? 
 
A: I think I backed it in. 
 
Q: Okay.  And how did you enter into the house? 
 
A: I came up the back stairs through the garage. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you observe any blood on the back driveway? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you have any discussion with Lou Brown about a 
key to the condominium? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: At any time? 
 
A: What he wanted was to get the Ferrari out of there, but it was -- 
something was wrong with it.  So I told him that I would see to it, 
and he had given me the garage opener. 
 
Q: Okay.  On the afternoon of the 14th? 
 
A: Sometime during either when we got ready to leave after we 
had packed up all the cars with Nicole's stuff or stuff we was gonna 
take to Laguna, I had to get some other things for the kids. 
 
Q: Out of the Bundy residence? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you get them that day? 
 
A: Minnie put together some clothes for the kids. 
 
Q: Okay.  And you took the garage door opener with you? 
 
A: I think I did, yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Where did you put it when you took it with you that 
day? 
 
A: I had it in the car with me, and I drove back down to Laguna to 
unload Nicole's things. 
 
Q: Do you recall what you did with it, the garage door opener, after 
you were back down in Laguna? 
 
A: I kept it with me. 
 
Q: Okay.  When was the next time you saw it after that? 
 
A: I had it at my house.  I don't know how much time went by, but 
Lou called me one day and requested the garage opener.  I said 
okay. 
 
Q: How long after was that, approximately? 
 
A: I really don't know.  It could have been a few days.  Could have 
been a week.  Could have been two weeks. 
 
Q: Was it after -- do you recall whether or not it was after Mr. 
Simpson's arrest? 
 
A: Probably, yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. Did Lou ever give you a key to that residence at 875 
South Bundy?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever see a key to that residence at 875 South Bundy? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever have any discussions with anybody regarding a 
key to 875 South Bundy? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Did Cora Fischman ever tell you she had a key to 875 South 
Bundy? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you have any discussions with Cora Fischman regarding a 
key to 875 South Bundy? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know who, if anybody, ever had a key to 875 South 
Bundy? 
 
A: Not to my knowledge, no. 
 
Q: Going back to the Rockingham residence for a minute, you had 
had a key for that residence for many years, had you not? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did Mr. Simpson also leave a key hidden to that 
residence anywhere? 
 
A: Not that I know of. 
 
Q: Never left a key outside anywhere? 
 
A: Not that I know of. 
 
Q: Okay.  By the way, you had mentioned that those gates would 
open automatically and then close after a period of time? 
 
A: The gate at Rockingham will close automatically after a few 
seconds' delay.  The gate on Ashford will open from the inside 
through the phone.  They would punch I think the number was 5 to 
open the phone.  And if you were familiar with the situation, with 
the grounds, when you walked in there's a monitor on the right.  As 
you walk in, you push the little white button, and it would close the 
gates on the Ashford side. 
 
Q: But Ashford didn't close automatically? 
 
A: It closed automatically once you pushed the button or if you 
push 5 again inside. 
 
Q: If you did not take one of those two particular actions, it would 
not just close on its own? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you ever see the dogs run off the premises at 
Rockingham? 
 
A: They occasionally will get out, and if I was there I would 
retrieve them, because it was -- the neighbors used to complain 
about the dogs getting out. 
 
Q: How many dogs did Simpson have? 
 
MR. LEONARD: At what time period? 
 
MR. KELLY: As of June 1994. 
 
THE WITNESS: June what? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: June 1994, immediately prior to the murders. 
 
A: I don't know if the dogs had passed away -- a couple of dogs had 
passed away.  I don't know if they passed away during that time 
know there was three dogs normally there, two Chows and a half 
Chow-Lab, black, Cheba. 
 
Q: Do you remember Chatchi? 
 
A: Chatchi, yes. 
 
Q: Did you ever see Chatchi off the premises? 
 
A: They would follow Chubbs.  Chubbs was the leader.  If Chubbs 
got out, they followed Chubbs.  Chubbs was the most stubborn 
one.  I mean, you can always get Chatchi and Cheba to come back. 
Chubbs had a mind of his own. 
 
Q: Okay.  Were you ever at Rockingham when Simpson was being 
picked up to go to the airport? 
 
A: Have I ever seen him being picked up? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Did you ever see him miss a flight? 
 
MR.LEONARD: I didn't hear the question. I'm sorry. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did you ever see Simpson miss a flight? 
 
A: O.J.'s very punctual when he's making his trips.  Every time I 
was invited to come along, I always made sure I was there earlier 
because I didn't want, you know, no one to -- him to say, "Why you 
late?  You're hanging me up."  So as far as I know, he made -- he 
was very accurate in making his flights. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was he organized generally about his travel? 
 
A: Yeah, uh-huh. 
 
Q: Was he always packed ahead of time? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: That I don't know. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Well, the times you were there, was he always packed and ready 
--  
 
A: Sometimes. 
 
Q: -- in plenty of time when he was getting picked up? 
 
A: Sometimes he would be and other times he wouldn't.  But he 
used to tease that "Hey, I never missed a flight." 
 
Q: Would he usually be waiting for his limousine when it would 
arrive when you were there? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.  Vague. 
 
THE WITNESS: What do you mean by "waiting"?  Standing 
outside or sitting on the bench? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Yeah, any of those. 
 
A: No. Normally the limousine driver will pull up.  If I'm already 
there, I got the gate open for him just to pull in.  If I'm not, I'm 
quite sure he calls; let O.J. know he's there. 
 
Q: Okay.  In your experience, O.J. was always packed, though, 
when the limousine arrived? 
 
A: That I don't know. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Sometimes there were bags downstairs, bigger 
bags, and maybe he had a bag upstairs with him that probably -- 
maybe he was still packing or -- with his personal stuff.  I don't 
know if it was packed or unpacked. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did you ever see him rushing to still pack clothes while the car 
was waiting to go to the airport when you were there? 
 
A: No, I don't remember. 
 
Q: You don't remember that? 
 
A: I don't remember seeing that. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you ever see Simpson chipping golf balls in his 
front yard? 
 
A: Yeah, he did that quite a bit. 
 
Q: Did you ever see him doing it at night? 
 
A: I wasn't by there at night that much. 
 
Q: Did you ever see him chip golf balls at night at Rockingham:, 
 
A: I wasn't by there that much at night. 
 
Q: Did you ever see Mr. Simpson chip golf balls in his front yard 
at night? 
 
A: Not that I saw. 
 
Q: Okay.  Are you familiar with the lighting in the front of 
Rockingham? 
 
MR.LEONARD: At what point in time? 
 
MR. KELLY: June 1994. 
 
THE WITNESS: When you say, "Are you familiar with the 
lighting," you're saying what? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: The lighting, the spotlights, mushroom lights, the electrical 
lighting he had on the exterior of his house. 
 
A: Do you want the outside lights?  I was aware of how to turn 
them on and off if I was doing it. 
 
Q: Were you aware of the fact that he had mushroom lights around 
the edge of his driveway? 
 
A: What's "mushroom lights"? 
 
Q: Little, small lights on the ground. 
 
A: Yes, uh-huh. 
 
Q: Do you know of any lights in the front of his house at 
Rockingham, Simpson's house at Rockingham, other than those 
small mushroom lights around his driveway? 
 
A: There were lights up on the pillars of the big wall by the gates. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: Pillars.  I think there's lights up on the trees outside of the front.  
There's a door outside light in the walk area when you walk into 
the house. 
 
Q: Right out -- right next to the front door there? 
 
A: I think it --yeah, when you walk in, before you open the door, 
just overhead there's a light, I think. 
 
Q: Okay.  He didn't have any flood lights pointing out to the grass 
area of the front yard, did he? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: That you knew of. 
 
A: That I knew of, yes. 
 
Q: You did not know of any flood lights pointing out to the grass 
area of his front yard. 
 
A: No, I don't know if he had or not. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you ever, in the last year or two before June 1994, 
ever see Mr. Simpson in a dark sweat suit? 
 
A: O.J. has worn a lot of various sweat suits. 
 
Q: Did you ever see him in a navy blue one? 
 
A: It could have been a navy blue.  I think he had a -- I think Elysee 
or someone used to send him a lot of stuff.  It could have been Fila.  
O.J. was always getting stuff sent to him by various sporting good 
companies for | free. 
 
Q: Do you recall seeing him in a navy blue sweat suit? 
 
A: I don't remember.  O.J. was playing a lot of golf then, so him 
and I didn't see a lot of each other because then he was always 
going to bed early and getting up and going to play golf.  So I 
would normally call him around about 6:00 or 7:00 when I think 
he's back and say, "Hey, man; how you doing," something like 
that, so I didn't see him a lot. 
 
Q: When you saw him, do you ever recall seeing him hanging out 
either in a navy blue or black sweat suit? 
 
A: Sometimes he'd be still in his golf stuff.  I don't remember, you 
know, seeing him in, you know -- I really don't remember, to be 
honest with you. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you remember the colors of any of the sweat suits 
you had seen him in? 
 
A: No, I don't. 
 
MR. LEONARD:  Objection.  Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: No, I don't, sir. 
 
MR. LEONARD: While you're looking, can we take just five 
minutes? 
 
MR. KELLY: Yeah. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the 
time is approximately 3:03. 
 
(Recess.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 3:12. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Mr. Cowlings, were you aware of the fact that Mr. Simpson was 
on the board of the company that made Swiss Army knives? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did he ever give you any Swiss Army knives? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And could you tell me on what occasions he gave you Swiss 
Army knives? 
 
A: The first one I got, we just had a group of -- I don't know if it 
was Christmas or -- he had like an awful lot of them.  He gave me a 
red knife, the red face pocket-size --  
 
Q: Utility knife? 
 
A: Yes.  And he gave me a black -- no -- black with red in the -- 
around it Swiss Army watch.  
 
Q: Okay.  Other than those two Swiss Army knife items, did he 
give you anything else? 
 
A: He didn't.    
 
Q: Who did? 
 
A: Louis Marx. 
 
Q: Okay.  What did Louis -- by the way, where is Louis Marx 
from? 
 
A: He's from New York. 
 
Q: Okay.  And what did Louis Marx give you? 
 
A: Watches, which I have -- one I have on now.  Two others.  And 
a big -- the big Swiss Army knife camper.  I don't know the name 
they use for it.  Utility one -- or the big knife. 
 
Q: The big knife. 
 
A: The big knife, with can openers and screwdrivers and all that to 
it. 
 
Q: Okay.  Could you indicate with your fingers how long that knife 
is? 
 
A: I guess about like that (Indicating), about that thick (Indicating). 
 
Q: Okay.  And is the blade on that as long as the handle, if you 
know what I mean? 
 
A: I really don't know.  I don't know -- it's long, but I don't know if 
it's the length of the actual knife. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you still have that, by the way? 
 
A: Yes, I do, sir. 
 
Q: Okay.  And what is in that particular knife besides a large 
blade? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection to "large."  Vague. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: I am sorry.  Go on. 
 
A: Scissors, pliers, a tweezers, some thing like a file.  It's a utility 
thing.  It got a lot of things to it. 
 
Q: Okay. Was it your understanding that Louis Marx was on the 
board of this company also that made this Swiss Army knife? 
 
A: Yeah.  I would think, yeah. I mean, he owned it. 
 
Q: Okay.  He was the owner of this company? 
  
A: Yes, sir. 
 
Q: Okay.  And how long had you been friends with Louis Marx 
for? 
 
A: Since -- I met Louis in '78.  We -- that was the same time that the 
three of us, Nicole and O.J. and myself, was in New York.  He was 
still working on the movie FIREPOWER. 
 
Q: Okay. Are you still friends with Louis Marx? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When was the last time you spoke to him? 
 
A: It's been some time.  My last initial contact with Louis was 
when he gave me this watch (Indicating). We had lunch. That 
would have been -- When was I filming --  
 
Q: Don't tell me Re was there for that lunch, too? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. RE: I didn't get the watch. 
 
THE WITNESS: When did I -- when I was caught in the topless 
place? 
 
MR. RE: It was like about --  
 
MR. BREWER: That's my line of questioning. 
 
MR.PETROCELLI: Mike's the expert. 
 
THE WITNESS: I used to be.  It's been I would say over a year 
now.  I would say over a-year. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever see any boxes of large Swiss Army knives 
that Simpson had? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection to large.  It's vague. 
 
THE WITNESS: No, I didn't. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did you see -- other than the knives you have described to me 
here a moment ago, did you ever see any other type of Swiss Army 
knives in Mr. Simpson's house? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Did you ever see any type of other knives in Mr. Simpson's 
house, other than, you know, serving knives? 
 
A: Serving knives? 
 
Q: Yeah, like place-setting knives. 
 
A: Yeah, I saw a lot of that. 
 
Q: Other than those, did you see any other types of knives? 
 
A: Butter knives, carving knives, utility knives, in the kitchen. 
 
Q: Did you ever see -- do you know what a gravity knife is? 
 
A: No, I don't.  What is a gravity knife? 
 
Q: It's where you can open it with your own -- a flick of the wrist. 
 
A: No, sir, I've never seen a knife like that. 
 
Q: Okay.  You've never seen one of those over at Mr. Simpson's 
house? 
 
A: No, I didn't. 
 
Q: Okay. Have you at any time seen any of the photographs of Mr. 
Simpson wearing leather gloves while he was broadcasting for 
NBC Sports? 
 
A: Have I ever seen the photographs?   
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: I've seen a few of them, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And do you recall ever seeing Mr. Simpson wearing 
those type of gloves?  
 
A: Personally or --  
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: -- seen in the --  
 
Q: No, I mean, have you yourself been with Mr. Simpson when he 
has been wearing leather gloves? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Were you ever given a pair of leather gloves by Nicole 
as a gift? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  And you have no independent recollection of Mr. 
Simpson ever wearing leather gloves? 
 
A: Have I ever seen him in person wearing --  
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Have you ever --  
 
A: No.  I take that back.  I take that back.  Yes.  Our earlier years in 
Buffalo, that's when I was playing for Buffalo, during the winter 
months it was very practical for everyone to wear gloves and long 
coats when we went on the road or, you know, it was snowing 
outside. 
 
Q: Okay.  So at some point you do remember Mr. Simpson 
wearing leather gloves. 
 
A: Yes, sir. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall what color? 
 
A: They could have been brown.  They could have been black. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you know what size glove you wear yourself? 
 
A: I don't wear gloves, sir.    
 
Q: Ever? 
 
A: I tried.  My hands -- my fingers are -- and my palm -- the base of 
my hand is too big.  I can never find a pair to fit. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you ever try to force a pair of gloves on? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Okay.  I am going to ask you to look at a couple photographs 
here.  They are not marked at --  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Here they are. 
 
MR. KELLY: Forget it. I think we got some better ones here. 
 
THE WITNESS: I hope so. 
 
(Discussion held off the record.)  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: I am going to ask you to look at the three pink-tabbed 
photographs. 
 
A: Oh, you want me to look at all three of  them? 
 
Q: Yeah, look at all three of them. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Just the ones with the pink, Mr. Cowlings.   
 
THE WITNESS: Uh-huh. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  You have had a chance to look at those exhibits, No. 54, 
55 and 56? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And do you recognize who is in those three photographs? 
 
A: Everyone or just -- in all three of those photographs, do you -- 
you want me to recognize the whole -- I mean, the threesome or 
just --  
 
Q: Well, do you recognize Mr. Simpson --  
 
A: Yes, sir, I do. 
 
Q: -- in all three of those photographs?  Are you able to observe 
him wearing gloves in those photographs? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do those gloves appear to be similar to the type of gloves you 
recall Mr. Simpson wearing when you saw him? 
 
A: When I saw him where? 
 
Q: Wearing gloves previously. 
 
A: In Buffalo? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: In the early '70s?   
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: I don't know if they're the same gloves. 
 
Q: No, not the same gloves.  Do you recall him wearing gloves 
similar to that? 
 
A: They could have been black or brown gloves. 
 
Q: Similar in appearance to the ones pictured in those 
photographs? 
 
A: Or they could have been the skin -- you're asking me and I'm 
telling you. 
 
Q: I know.  I didn't say anything. 
 
A: Could have been that calfskin with the furs inside, he could 
have been wearing during the time I saw him in Buffalo. 
 
Q: Okay.  I am not asking you about the inside of the gloves. 
 
A: I'm giving you the layout of the gloves. 
 
Q: Okay. But I am asking you, relative to these three pictures of 
Mr. Simpson with gloves on, do you recall him -- or do you recall 
observing him at any time wearing gloves similar to those? 
 
A: I couldn't be -- say they were similar, but they were gloves.  If 
they were exactly that style, I couldn't tell you.  That was in 19-- 
 
Q: Similar in style.  I am not asking if they're exactly the same 
style, but do you recall ever seeing Mr. Simpson wearing dark 
leather gloves similar to the ones he has on in these pictures? 
 
A: I've seen Mr. Simpson wear gloves. 
 
Q: Dark leather gloves? 
 
A: Dark gloves. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you know -- whether they were leather or not? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you have a recollection of seeing gloves once again similar 
-- I am not asking you if they are the exact gloves or the same 
gloves -- but similar to the gloves pictured here in these 
photographs? 
 
A: When? 
 
Q: Whenever you saw him wearing gloves. 
 
A: That would have been in the early '70s. 
 
Q: Okay.  Well, then in the early '70s. 
 
A: He wore gloves.  I don't --  
 
Q: Did he wear -- 
 
MR. RE: I think the problem is the word "similar."  When you're 
saying "similar," the size of the gloves, the cut of the gloves, or are 
you just  talking about the color or the shape?  It's the word 
"similar" that I think is throwing him that he's trying to get you to 
define. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Do you recall Mr. Simpson, in the early '70s when you saw him 
wearing gloves, wearing gloves similar in color to the gloves 
depicted in those pictures? 
 
A: Dark gloves, yes. 
 
Q: Do you recall observing Mr. Simpson in the early '70s, when 
you saw him wearing gloves, wearing gloves similar in texture to 
those pictured? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Lack of foundation.  Asking him to speculate. 
 
THE WITNESS: Like I said earlier, he wore different types of 
gloves according to -- you know, he may -- if we were going on the 
road, he may have wore leather gloves.  If I saw him going to 
practice, he may have wore those big canvas gloves.  I couldn't tell 
you exactly if it was that particular style at the time I saw him that 
he was wearing. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: I am asking you a very general question, Mr. Cowlings. 
 
A: Yes, sir. 
 
Q: At any time when you observed Mr. Simpson wearing gloves, 
any of these times, did you ever observe him wearing gloves 
similar to these that are pictured here in the photographs? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Vague. 
 
THE WITNESS: I saw him wearing gloves. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Could you tell me, the gloves that you saw, how they differed 
from the ones pictured in these photographs? 
 
A: I couldn't tell you that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Maybe they didn't differ. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did they differ? 
 
A: I couldn't tell. I don't know. I didn't look at them.  All I know, it 
was cold; we all had gloves, and you wore gloves in the snow, you 
know, when it's cold outside, but I didn't ask him the style.  I didn't 
look at the style.  I didn't know how -- if it was leather or if it was 
vinyl. I didn't know if it was fur inside.  I didn't know if it was 
nothing inside. He just had on gloves. 
 
Q: Okay. You didn't wear gloves, though. 
 
A: I tried to wear gloves when it was cold. 
 
Q: But did you? 
 
A: Yeah, but it was hopeless because half my hand was out, so I 
just kept my hands in my pocket. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you -- I ask you to look at these exhibits 69 and 70.  
Just the front of 69 and 70. 
 
(Witness reviews photographs.) 
 
Q: Have you ever owned a cap like the ones pictured there in 69 
and 70? 
 
A: Probably in Buffalo, maybe I did.  I don't know for sure. 
 
Q: Do you recall ever wearing a knit ski cap when you were in 
Buffalo? 
 
A: Probably, yes. 
 
Q: Do you remember for sure or not? 
 
A: Sir, that was in 1970.  It was cold.  I mean, you did what was 
necessary to try to stay warm. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know whether Mr. Simpson ever owned a cap 
like that pictured in those photographs? 
 
A: Not to my knowledge. 
 
Q: Did you ever see him with a cap like that pictured in those 
photographs? 
 
A: I saw him in a film with a cap like that. 
 
Q: Which film was that in? 
 
A: That was one of the NAKED GUNs. 
 
Q: Okay. And was that -- do you recall what color that ski cap was? 
 
A: From the screen, it looked like it was a dark color. 
 
Q: Do you know which NAKED GUN that was? 
 
A: The scene was he was on the docks and he walked up on some 
crooks, and he had -- I don't know which one. 
 
MR.PETROCELLI: I think it's the first one. 
 
THE WITNESS: It was the first one? Could have been.  I don't 
know. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: And he had a cap similar to that on in that? 
 
A: He had a cap on his head on the screen. 
 
Q: I am asking you: Did he have a cap on similar to the one 
pictured in 69 and 70, as you recall? 
 
A: He had a dark cap on. 
 
Q: Similar to the one pictured in that -- You can see that picture in 
front of you, can't you, Mr. Cowlings? 
 
A: Yes, sir. You asked me -- all I can tell you is what I know. 
 
Q: I know. 
 
A: And you can't put words in my mouth.  I'm trying to tell you the 
best I can. 
 
Q: I understand that. 
 
A: He had a dark cap on. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: It could have been whatever.  It was a dark cap.  I didn't zero in.  
The scene was a funny scene.  All I know, he had a dark cap on. 
 
Q: Do you know what a knit cap is? 
 
A: A knit is like a sweater-type of cap. 
 
Q: Right. 
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q: Does that appear to be a knit cap in that picture there? 
 
A: Seems to be. It has the lines to it. 
 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: The lines. Looks like it could be a knit cap. 
 
Q: Okay. And could you tell me if you recall any differences 
between those caps pictured in 69 and 70 and the cap Mr. Simpson 
had on in that film that you recall? 
 
A: You ask me '69 and '70? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Exhibits --  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Exhibits 69 and 70. 
 
A: The caps that I wore? 
 
MR. RE: No. This is exhibits 69 and 70. 
 
THE WITNESS: Oh, I thought you were talking about the year '69 
and '70.  You were saying what, sir?  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Could you tell me if there is any difference between those caps 
that you're looking at right now and the cap Mr. Simpson had on 
his head in that movie, as you recall? 
 
A: I couldn't honestly tell you exactly.  I know he had on a dark 
cap.  It could have been similar to this. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was it similar to that? 
 
A: I'm going to say I don't know because I really don't. 
 
Q: So as you sit here today, are you able to identify for me any 
differences between those -- that cap in that photograph and the cap 
Mr. Simpson had on his head in that movie? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know, sir. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Mr. Cowlings, on the morning of June 13th, did you have 
occasion to go by Rockingham? 
 
A: Privilege. 
 
Q: On the morning of June 13th prior to Mr. Simpson arriving 
back from Chicago -- 
 
MR. RE: Withdraw the privilege.  Do you understand the time 
period we're talking about? 
 
THE WITNESS: Before he got back?  
 
MR. RE: Yeah. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did you have occasion to go by Rockingham? 
 
A: I was called to Rockingham. 
 
Q: And who called you to Rockingham? 
 
A: Arnelle. 
 
Q: And could you tell me what she said to you when she called you 
at that time? 
 
A: It was early in the morning.  I don't know exactly what time.  
She woke me up.  She was -- I could tell that she was upset about 
something.  I thought she was ill first, and I said, "Baby, what's 
wrong?" Because I had taken her to the hospital because she has a 
stomach problem.  She has called me before; I would come over 
and take her to the hospital because she has severe pains and 
cramps that she can't straighten up.  So I thought -- I said, "What's 
wrong?  Tell me, Arnelle, tell me," and she got her composure, and 
she said Nicole was dead. 
 
Q: Did she say anything other than that? 
 
A: I said, "What?"  And she said, "Nicole is dead."  And I said, 
"What happened?"  She says, "I don't know.  The police are here."  
She says, "Would you come over?" 
 
Q: And did you go over there? 
 
A: Yes, I did. 
 
Q: Did you go over there immediately? 
 
A: Yes, I did. 
 
Q: And could you tell me what, if anything, you observed when 
you arrived there? 
 
A: When I got there, there was a patrol car.  The officer got out 
when I got out of my car, and I said, "I was called to the house," 
and he just like waved me on, and I walked into the house and 
there were people inside. 
 
Q: You just saw one officer there when you arrived there? 
 
A: The -- no, no, no.  Outside of the house.  When I got inside the 
house, there was more officers inside. 
 
Q: But you only observed one patrol car outside when you arrived 
there?  
 
A: I don't know.  All I know, when I got out, I looked to my right, I 
think, he was walking towards me, and I said, "I was called to the 
house," and he just kinda like waved me on. He was a -- dressed in 
regular police uniform, blue.  
 
Q: He was a uniformed cop. 
 
A: A uniformed policeman, yes. 
 
Q: And he was sitting in a marked police car at that time? 
 
A: It was a black-and-white. 
 
Q: Okay. Was there anybody else in the police car with him? 
 
A: I didn't notice. 
 
Q: Would you be able to describe the policeman to me? 
 
A: No.  I don't -- I don't know if he was black and I don't know if 
he was white.  I was more concentrating on what was going on, 
what was going on in the house. 
 
Q: Do you recall which gate you walked in when you went to the 
house? 
 
A: I came through the Ashford gate. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you make any observations as you came through the 
Ashford gate? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Did you see any blood in the driveway? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Did you see any little white cards in the driveway? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Okay.  When was the first time you saw someone as you 
walked up to the house? 
 
A: I don't know if I used -- I don't know if I came -- I don't know if 
I used my key to open the front door or the front door was already 
cracked, but I came through the front door.  I turned into the 
kitchen because I heard voices. 
 
Q: Did you make any observations at all in the front foyer? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Did you see any blood in the foyer? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Did you see any blood anywhere in the interior of the house on 
the floor? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Did you see any markings there anywhere on the floor in the 
interior of the house? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Did anybody caution you to avoid anything when you walked 
into the house at that time? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Okay.  What happened next after you entered the house?. 
 
A: I walked into the kitchen.  I introduced myself.  I think Arnelle 
was there -- 
 
Q: Who did you introduce yourself to? 
 
A: I introduced myself to -- I don't know which one was first, I 
don't know if Vannatter or Lange or Fuhrman, but I introduced 
myself to them.  They asked me my name, and I gave it to them, 
and I think they gave me their cards.  And I think they asked me, 
did I know where O.J. was, and I said, "I think he's out of town." 
 
Then I asked -- I don't think I asked.  They were trying to get in 
touch with Nicole's parents at that time, and I think -- I think one of 
the officers --he was receded on the top; he had dark hair on the 
side, and he informed them that Nicole was dead. 
 
Q: Were you there when the officer called the Browns? 
 
A: Yes, I was. 
 
Q: Did you provide a number for them to call? 
 
A: No. I think they had the number from Arnelle. 
 
Q: Why do you think that? 
 
A: They didn't ask me for the number. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you hear Arnelle give it to them? 
 
A: I don't know if Arnelle dialed the number. I don't know if she 
speed dialed it.  I really couldn't tell you. 
 
Q: Were you able to hear what the officer said on the phone? 
 
A: He said -- I don't know.  He said Nicole was dead.  I don't know 
if he said she was murdered or not.  I gasped.  I threw my hand 
over my mouth.  I grabbed Arnelle, and we embraced each other.  
This is very difficult thing for me. 
 
Q: Sure. 
 
A: Continue. 
 
Q: What else did you hear the officer say at that time? 
 
A: I asked about the kids, where were the kids, and they said they 
took them out the back. They took them out of the back of the 
house because the front -- or it was too much commotion out in 
front. 
 
Q: Did you observe any commotion in front? 
 
A: Commotion in front where? 
 
MR. RE: He's talking about the back -- 
 
THE WITNESS: I am talking about what the officer told me when 
I asked about the kids. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Oh, okay. I'm sorry. At Bundy, you're talking about now? 
 
A: When I asked where the kids were -- 
 
Q: Right. 
 
A: -- he said the kids were fine; they were at the police station.  
"We took them out the back way so they wouldn't see the 
commotion in the front." 
 
Q: Okay. Did you know what he was referring to when he said, 
"the commotion in the front"? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Okay. Which officer was saying this to you? 
 
A: I don't know if Vannatter said it to me.  I don't know if the 
officer who was on the phone said it to me.  I said, "Can I go get 
the kids?"  And they said yes, and they said, "Don't go down 
Bundy because we got it blocked off." 
 
So Arnelle and I got in the car and drove to the station on Purdue 
to pick up the kids. 
 
Q: From where you were, you wouldn't have to drive down Bundy 
to get to the police station, would you? 
 
A: You could take Bundy, but I went around -- I went San Vicente 
to Federal and took Federal down to Santa Monica Boulevard, cut 
-- turned left and went over to Purdue to the Westside station on the 
-- where the Westside police station is. 
 
Q: Was Arnelle with you in the car? 
 
A: Yes, she was. 
 
Q: When you first entered the house, once again -- I'm sorry -- do 
you recall which police officer asked you where Simpson was? 
 
A: It could have been Vannatter, I think.  I couldn't be, you know, 
clear on that. 
 
Q: Do you have a specific recollection of Detective Lange being 
there at that time? 
 
A: He could have been there.  It was about four gentlemen in the 
kitchen when I arrived. 
 
Q: You know who Detective Fuhrman is, do you not? 
 
A: Yes, I do. We shook hands. 
 
Q: And was he in the kitchen --  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- when you arrived there? 
 
A: Yes.  Yes, was. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was he present when you were asked where Simpson 
was? 
 
A: I think I was asked in the hallway.  Well, I think I stepped back 
out.  I think Arnelle and I kind of like went back out into the 
hallway, and I think she said, "I'm going to call my mother," and 
she went to her room. 
 
And I think one of the officers -- it could have been Vannatter -- 
asked me, "Do you know where O.J. is?" 
 
And I said, "I think he's out of town." 
 
Q: Did they ask you anything else after that? 
 
A: Excuse me.  I think I said, "You could call Cathy, his assistant.  
She would know where O.J. is." 
 
Q: Did they ask anything else about Cathy? 
 
A: I don't know if Arnelle had already given them information on 
Cathy.  They didn't ask me for her number. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did they ask you if you knew what time Mr. Simpson 
had left that day? 
 
A: I don't remember if they did. 
 
Q: Did they ask you whether you had talked to Simpson at all that 
day? 
 
A: I told them that I stopped by the house earlier Sunday morning.  
I was on my way to see a friend who was in town, and he was 
staying at a house in that area, and I left -- I left my place in the 
Palisades and I realized I forgot the address, so I remembered -- it 
was an easy number to remember at the time. 
 
So I stopped off at O.J.'s house, and it appeared to me that maybe 
O.J. was off somewhere playing golf, which was about -- could 
have been like 8:00 o'clock, 8:30 in the morning, so I used the 
outside phone by the tennis court to call my friend to get the 
address where he was. 
 
Q: Okay.  You didn't see Simpson that morning at all? 
 
A: No, I didn't, sir. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you have any personal knowledge as to what 
Simpson was doing on the evening f June 12th, 1994? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Did you know that Sydney had her dance recital that day? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Had you been invited to the dance recital that day? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Had you been to any dance recitals of Sydney's in the past? 
 
A: Yes, I have, sir. 
 
Q: More than one? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you attended them with Simpson? 
 
A: With Simpson, with [Name Deleted], because sometimes his 
daughter would be in the same dance recital, and it was like an all-
day thing, you know, where we stayed there for Danielle and we 
stayed there for Sydney. 
 
Q: Did you go out for a meal afterwards the other times you'd been 
to Sydney's recital? 
 
A: I think I did with Alan.  I don't know if I did with the Browns 
and O.J. 
 
Q: Would Simpson always after family events like that go out as a 
family with the Browns and  people if they were there? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection.  Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember that.  I would have no 
knowledge of it. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Do you ever remember, in all your experience of attending the 
events for Sydney and Justin Simpson, not being welcome at 
something for one of the children? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you ever remember Mr. Simpson being excluded from a 
family dinner or family gathering for any reason that involved the 
children? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Vague. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. When you were in the car with Arnelle driving over to 
Nicole's condo -- I mean -- I'm sorry -- the police station, did you 
have any conversation with Arnelle? 
 
A: I couldn't -- it was conversation.  I think we were really 
confused.  We didn't know at that time any of the -- we didn't know 
anything, just the fact that she was dead, and --  
 
Q: Did you know she had been murdered? 
 
A: I don't know. I really don't know.  Like I said, when the officer 
called the Browns, I don't know if he said she was -- Nicole had 
been murdered or Nicole is dead.  I really don't know.  I know he 
told them something.  Arnelle was very emotional, and we kinda 
got ourselves together because we didn't want the kids to see -- you 
know, to see us, because before we gathered they knew nothing. 
 
We got there and I walked in and introduced myself to the officers, 
and I said, "I'm here to pick up Sydney and Nicole" -- I mean 
"Sydney and Justy," and they came out, you know, jumping up, 
embracing Arnelle and I, and they were showing us things that the 
officer had gave them.  So I thanked the officers for everything, 
and I took them back up to the house. 
 
Q: To which house? 
 
A: To Rockingham. 
 
Q: Okay.  When you were still at Rockingham the first time, other 
than that one police officer asking you if you knew where Simpson 
was, did they ask you any other questions? 
 
A: I can't put the questions if I was there the first time or after I 
came back.  I was asked where he was -- I know that for a fact -- 
when I first got there.  I don't know if I was asked where were the 
Bronco keys the first time or after I got back.  They asked me when 
was the last time I had seen O.J.  I said I hadn't seen him in about a 
week or so, maybe longer. We were supposed to meet up in New 
York.  I was back East, and I was leaving New York on a 
Wednesday.  I talked to him on Tuesday.  He was coming into 
New York on a Wednesday, and he was trying to talk me into 
staying over, and I said, "No, I have to get back.  I wish you could 
come out earlier." 
 
Q: Staying over where?  I'm sorry. 
 
A: And he wanted me to stay an extra day in New York.  I was 
already in New York.   
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: I spoke to him -- he was on his car phone when I spoke to him. 
 
Q: Okay.  And did you know what his plans were for the rest of the 
week after Wednesday? 
 
A: He said to me --  
 
Q: I'm sorry I interrupted you.  You were telling me what you had 
told the police officers at  Rockingham. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: I'm sorry. 
 
A: That I think we left it off where he said he was coming back -- 
we left it off how O.J. -- I mean, in our conversation that 
Wednesday, that he'd be back because he had to be somewhere for 
Sydney.  So I said, "Well, when you come back, let's get together 
either Friday or Saturday night." 
 
And he said, "Okay, I'll call you," but I never heard from him. 
 
Q: And did you know what he was going to be doing after 
Saturday night again? 
 
A: On the West Coast? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: No, he never told me what he had to get back for.  He just said 
he had to get back for something for Sydney. 
 
Q: But when you first walked into Rockingham, the detective 
asked you if you knew where Simpson was. Correct? 
 
A: Yes, and I told him I didn't know. 
 
Q: I am sorry.  I thought you had answered that you thought he was 
out of town. 
 
A: Yeah, I thought he was out of town. 
 
Q: And what was the basis for thinking that? 
 
A: He could have said to me on that conversation on Wednesday 
that he was leaving again; he had to fly back in, and I don't know if 
on that Sunday day or the weekend, but he said he had to get back; 
then he had to leave out again on some type of trip. He never said --  
 
Q: Did he say where he was going? 
 
A: No, he didn't. 
 
Q: Did he say when he was going? 
 
A: He just said he had to leave again.  
 
Q: Did he tell you what day he had to leave? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he tell you what time of day he had to leave, if not that day? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he tell you what city he was going to? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he tell you why he was going?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did any detective at any time when you were at Rockingham 
either time that morning ask you if you knew what time Simpson 
had left his house the previous night? 
 
A: They could have asked me.  I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay.  Can you remember for certain whether they ever asked 
you that or not? 
 
A: I'm not sure, sir. 
 
Q: Were you able to give them any information as to when 
Simpson had left that previous night? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: If anything, I told them the best person to talk to 
was Cathy. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did you know what time Mr. Simpson had left Sunday? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Did you even know whether he had left town for sure Sunday? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you know where he was as you spoke Monday 
morning?  I'm sorry. Go ahead. 
 
A: My memory -- I remember asking them.  "Where is O.J.?"  And 
they say, "We think he's out of town." 
 
Q: Is this the first time you came into the house? 
 
A: No.  I think when Vannatter and I -- I assume it was Vannatter.  
I remember asking, them, "Where is O.J.?"  And they said, "We 
think he's out of town. We've been told that he's been out of town." 
 
Q: Okay.  And this is the first time you walked into Rockingham? 
 
A: It could have been. 
 
Q: You're not certain, though?  
 
A: No, I'm not certain. 
 
Q: Did they tell you anything else about Simpson's whereabouts? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Did they ask you anything else about Simpson's whereabouts? 
 
A: I don't remember if they did or not. 
 
Q: Did they indicate to you what time he had left? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Did they indicate to you where he was at that time? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Did they indicate to you that they wanted to speak to him? 
 
A: They didn't indicate to me, no, sir. 
 
Q: Okay. When you went to the police station, did you have any 
discussions with any police officer there as to what had happened 
at Bundy? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: When you came back to Rockingham then after leaving the 
police station, what, if anything else, did you discuss with the --  
First of all, who was there when you got back from the police 
station? 
 
A: The same four that was there earlier. 
 
Q: Okay.  And you remember Lange being there? 
 
A: Lange could have been there. 
 
Q: You specifically remember Vannatter? 
 
A: Vannatter, Fuhrman, I know for a fact, because Vannatter and I 
eventually -- that's who I did all my talking to.  Fuhrman I knew for 
a fact was there. 
 
The officer -- he wasn't -- it wasn't Lange that informed me -- it 
wasn't Lange that told me that -- to go down -- I mean, how to go to 
the police station, not to go down Bundy. This one -- I don't know 
-- he was thin.  I forget his name.  He wasn't one -- I never saw him 
again in any of the -- 
 
Q: Criminal trial? 
 
A: He probably was called, but I never saw any more of him during 
the news, anything like that.  It was always Vannatter and Lange.  I 
take that back.  He was Fuhrman's partner. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Phillips? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Phillips? 
 
A: Phillips, yes. He was Fuhrman's partner.  They were both from 
the Westside. 
 
Q: Okay. So you remember all four of those detectives -- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- being there that morning. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And other than those four detectives and Arnelle, was anybody 
else in the kitchen? 
 
MR. LEONARD: At what time, John? 
 
MR. KELLY: The first time he arrived at Rockingham. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember.  I think that was about it. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you ever see Kato Kaelin --  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --the first time you arrived? 
A: Kato -- I'm trying to put it in a frame.  I don't know when I first 
got there I saw Kato or after I got back from the police station, but 
Kato and I did see each other, and he was -- he looked sad, and he 
said to me, "A.C., I heard some." -- we were in the family room, the 
big room where the TVs and stuff  is --  
 
Q: I am sorry to interrupt, but do you know, is this the first time or 
the second time you're back at Rockingham? 
 
A: That's what I'm trying -- I mean, I don't know if it was before I 
left to go pick up the kids or after I got back. 
 
Q: Okay. Well, do you recall, when you were present there and the 
Browns were informed by phone of Nicole's death, whether Kato 
was there at that time or not? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: I don't remember seeing him. 
 
Q: Okay. So tell me about -- oh, you don't remember seeing him 
that time? 
 
A: I don't remember seeing him the first time when I first arrived. 
 
Q: Okay.  You do remember seeing him the second time, though? 
 
A: When I first arrived, I don't remember seeing him.  It could 
have been later on, a few minutes later that I saw him, or it could 
have been after I got back. 
 
Q: Okay.  And what, if anything, did he say to you? 
 
A: He said to me, "A.C., I heard some noises last night." 
 
And I said, "Did you tell the officers?"  And he said, "Yeah."  And 
I said, "Okay.  That's good." 
 
Q: Is that the only thing he said to you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did he ever tell you what kind of noises? 
 
A: I don't know if he did.  He just said noises.  I don't know if he 
told me -- I really don't know.  I wouldn't be -- I wouldn't -- I don't 
know exactly what noises, but he told me he heard some noises 
heard some noises or heard whatever.  I don't know exactly. 
 
Q: Did he tell you where he heard the noises? 
 
A: It was outside of -- outside of his apartment on the back side. 
 
Q: And he specifically told you that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And he told you he had already told the officers that? 
 
A: When I asked, I said, "Did you tell the officers that," and he 
said, "Yes," I said, "Good." 
 
Q: Okay.  Did he tell you anything else? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You had indicated earlier that someone had mentioned 
something about a Bronco key?  I am sorry.  We have to take a 
break now. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: This is the end of tape No. 2 of Volume 
II.  The time is approximately 3:54, and we are off the record. 
 
(Recess.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are on the record.  The time is 
approximately 4 09.  This is the beginning of tape No. 3 of Volume 
II. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Mr. Cowlings, we were -- when we broke, we were talking 
about the morning of June 13th, 1994 at Rockingham. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you had just related a conversation you had had with Mr. 
Kaelin at that time. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Other than him making reference to the thumps behind 
the guesthouse -- or noises that he heard behind the guesthouse -- 
I'm sorry -- did you discuss anything else with him at that time? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: No, sir. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  You also indicated earlier that the topic of Bronco keys 
came up at some point when you were at Rockingham that 
morning. 
 
A: Yes, sir.  One of the officers -- I don't know which one; I don't 
know if they asked me, was that O.J.'s Bronco or was that his car, 
but I remember I was asked about the Bronco keys. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you see the Bronco when you pulled up that 
morning? 
 
A: I don't remember, sir --    
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: -- if it was there or not. 
 
Q: Okay.  Which street did you park on when you pulled up to the 
Rockingham residence? 
 
A: I came up Rockingham off of Sunset, and when I got to 
Ashford, I turned right. 
 
Q: Onto Rockingham? 
 
A: No.  Onto Ashford off of Rockingham.  I came off of Sunset 
from where I live in Santa Monica -- no.  I'm sorry.  From the 
Palisades I come straight down Sunset, cross Mandeville Canyon, 
and the next left you can make is Rockingham. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: And I came up Rockingham, and when I got to Ashford, I 
turned right.  That's the corner of Rockingham and Ashford.  That's 
where the house sits. 
 
Q: And did you park on Ashford? 
 
A: Yes, sir. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall which direction you were facing when you 
parked on Ashford? 
 
A: I think I was facing east on the north side of the street. 
 
Q: Okay.  And you have no recollection of seeing the Bronco when 
you pulled up? 
 
A: I don't remember, like I said, my concentration was getting 
there to see what has happened. 
 
Q: Do you recall how long you were there the first time you 
arrived there at Rockingham? 
 
A: I don't remember how long I was there.  It was -- like I said, I 
don't know if that was the time they asked me about the Bronco 
keys or after I got back.  I think after -- Vannatter -- after we were 
all introduced, I think I -- after the announcement I heard about 
Nicole's -- the officer announcing Nicole's death to the Browns, I 
somehow worked my way to the family room, what you call it, and 
I think I called Wayne.  I know I called Wayne. 
 
Q: And this is the first time you were at Rockingham? 
 
A: It could have been. It could have been -- these events I'm telling 
you about actually, but I can't put them if they happened the first 
time I was there or after I got back. 
 
Q: Okay.  Let me ask you: From the first time you left 
Rockingham to go to the police station until the time you got back 
to Rockingham, could you tell me approximately how much time 
elapsed? 
 
A: Probably 20 minutes, maybe a little -- for the whole trip. 
 
Q: Okay.  Where does Wayne Hughes live, by the way? 
 
A: At that time Wayne was living in BelAir. 
 
Q: Okay. And do you recall approximately what time it was when 
you called him? 
 
A: It was early.  I woke him up.  I couldn't pinpoint a time. 
 
Q: Do you know whether it was light out or not yet? 
 
A: It was light.  When Nicole -- when Arnelle called me, it was 
light outside, like a hazy -- you know, like a low cloud type of -- on 
the Westside that's the way it's like in the morning.  So it could 
have been 6:00, 6:30, something like that, maybe a quarter to 7:00. 
 
Q: Would that be your best estimate as to what time it was, in that 
time range? 
 
A: I would put it somewhere around in there somewhere. I couldn't 
pinpoint a --  
 
Q: Okay.  How long from the time Arnelle called you till the time 
you got to Rockingham, would you guess? 
 
A: God, I was flying.  I was there in minutes.  It's straight down 
Sunset from where -- I lived on the corner of Sunset and 
Chautauqua, I think. 
 
MR. RE: Chautauqua? 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, Chautauqua. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. By the way, did you ever make the drive from 
Rockingham to Nicole's place on Bundy? 
 
A: When? 
 
Q: At any time.  Prior to June 12th. 
 
A: Like if I went by to visit her? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay.  Could you tell me approximately how long it takes to 
drive from Rockingham to her place on Bundy? 
 
A: I don't know if I came from Rockingham.  I probably came 
from my place in the Palisades. 
 
Q: You never drove from Rockingham to Bundy or from Bundy to 
Rockingham? 
 
A: Not that I can remember. 
 
Q: Okay. Would you been able to approximate the distance from 
one place to another? 
 
A: It's a very short distance. 
 
Q: More than a mile? 
 
A: It could be over a mile, I think. 
 
Q: Would you be able to approximate how long it would take you 
to drive from one place to another? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.  Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I couldn't tell you exactly how long it would take.  
It's very short.  If you left O.J.'s, you shoot down Gretna Green to 
San Vicente, hit Bundy.  It all depends if you can catch the light or 
not right there at Montana and -- well, if you came down Gretna 
Green there's no lights till you get to San Vicente, but when you 
get to Bundy and Vicente, you could turn right on the light, and 
there's a light at Montana and Bundy. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: You think it would be safe to say you could get from one 
location to another in less that five minutes? 
 
A: It all depends how fast you was driving.  It's a short distance. 
 
Q: Would it be fair to say, though, at a normal rate of speed you 
could get from one location to another in less than five minutes? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I wouldn't know, sir.  Like I said, I never timed 
my distance when I drive. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: But in relative terms, it would be a short distance from one 
piece to the other? 
 
A: It's a short distance. 
 
Q: Okay. Going back to your presence that morning at 
Rockingham on June 13th, 1994, could you relate to me every 
thing you heard in terms of discussion about the Bronco keys? 
 
A: Just that I think they asked me, was that his Bronco, and I said 
yes, or they may have already known that that was his Bronco and 
they could have asked me, "Do you know where the keys are?" 
 
Q: Okay. And what did you reply? 
 
A: I said, "Normally they stay in the kitchen area somewhere, 
either in a cup or over by the" -- there's a utility table next to the 
door that leads to the laundry room and an extra maid -- the maid's 
room, and normally that's where those keys are kept there, because 
we have all used that car at one time or another. 
 
It was like, you know, even before -- I used to use it before I had 
my Bronco, and I think I used it a few weeks before then because I 
put my Bronco in the shop to be serviced. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you see them -- did you tell them of those two 
locations, that the keys might be in one of those two locations? 
 
A: I looked. 
 
Q: You looked yourself? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Were you able to find them 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. RE: You looked yourself? Yes? You said --  
 
THE WITNESS: Yes, I looked. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Yes, you looked yourself in each of those locations? 
 
A: Yes, I looked myself. 
 
Q: Did you find the Bronco keys in either of those locations? 
 
A: No, I didn't. 
 
Q: Did you see any of the officers find those Bronco keys at any 
time?  
 
A: Not to my knowledge. 
 
Q: Did any officer ever indicate to you that he had found the 
Bronco keys at any time? 
 
A: Not to my knowledge. 
 
Q: Did you ever see that Bronco opened at any time when you 
were there? 
 
A: I was inside. 
  
Q: Okay. 
 
MR.PETROCELLI: Inside of the house? 
 
THE WITNESS: Inside of the house, yes. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall which detective asked about the Bronco 
keys? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. When you were testifying before, you said that most of 
the talking you did was with Vannatter that morning? 
 
A: Eventually I did most of the talking with him.  I spoke with -- 
what was -- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Phillips. 
 
THE WITNESS: Phillips, because he was very nice and, you 
know, expressing how to get there and not to go, you know, go 
down Bundy because there was a lot of commotion. It was blocked 
off and --  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: By the way, were you recall upset when you were at 
Rockingham that first time? 
 
A: I was upset because -- I mean, I was confused because every -- 
you know, all I knew, I was told that Nicole was dead, and it was 
just very confusing, and then I probably showed some emotion 
when I heard them tell Lou that Nicole was dead. 
 
Q: Okay.  How did these detectives treat you the first time you 
were there at Rockingham? 
 
A: Very nice. 
 
Q: Okay. And when you came back the second time, is that when 
you -- Well, could you tell me everything you discussed with 
Phillips, first of all? 
 
A: Well, Phillips was just explaining to me how, you know, not to 
travel down Bundy to get to the station, and he ensured me that the 
kids didn't see anything because they were still asleep when they 
got there, or whoever took them out, and they have no knowledge 
of what happened.  And so he was very nice. 
 
Q: And when you arrived back -- I'm sorry.  Did you talk to 
anybody other than Phillips the first time there? 
 
A: I could have spoken to Vannatter again.  I don't know for sure. 
 
Q: When you came back the second time to Rockingham -- 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: -- could you tell me what discussions you had at that time? 
 
A: I brought the kids in -- 
 
Q: By the way, was Arnelle with you -- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- when you came back to Rockingham again? 
 
A: Yes.  We brought the kids in -- 
 
Q: Did you have any discussion with the kids at all when you 
brought -- on your way back to Rockingham? 
 
A: More or less just kidding with them, trying to keep them -- you 
know, they wasn't puzzled or asking questions.  They was just -- 
whatever Justin -- whatever they gave Justin, he was still playing 
with, and I think they had some -- I don't  know if they had chips or 
some cookies or whatever, but they, you know, they seemed to be 
normal. 
 
Q: Okay. And when you got back to Rockingham, where did the 
kids -- how did you -- which entrance did you use to come back in 
Rockingham? 
 
A: Ashford. 
 
Q: Okay.  When you came through the gate, what entrance to the 
actual house itself did you use to come into the house? 
 
A: I think I brought the kids in through the door off the kitchen or 
through the front door.  What I did, I put on the TV for them.  
Sydney, like I say, she -- 
 
Q: First of all, can you tell me for sure or with some degree of 
certainty which door you came through when you came back to 
Rockingham? 
 
A: I couldn't tell you for sure. 
 
Q: Could you give me your best recollection? 
 
A: I couldn't tell you.  I could have came through that door or I 
could have came through the front door. 
 
Q: Do you recall whether you were prevented in any way from 
coming through the front door? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you recall seeing any officer near the front door when you 
approached it the second time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you recall seeing any cards or markers of any sort in the 
front courtyard immediately before the front door? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you recall seeing any markers in the driveway when you 
came back the second time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you recall seeing any markers of any sort in the front foyer 
when you arrived there the second time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did any detective there ever tell you to watch your step for any 
reason? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he ever caution you not to go in any particular areas of the 
house at that time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did any of them ever caution you not to go in any particular 
area outside the house? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, you were telling me what you did once you had arrived 
back at Rockingham that time. 
 
A: Once I got back, Arnelle and I put the kids in the kitchen, and 
there's a little section over there where there's a TV and all the 
video games and tapes and stuff.  They was watching cartoons, and 
I closed off -- I closed the doors off to the kitchen, and I took the 
lock off the front door and left it open so the officers could go in 
and out without disturbing the kids. 
 
Q: Okay.  When you went to the front door to take the lock off, did 
you make any observations in the front foyer? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you see any markers on the floor at that time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you see any blood on the floor at that time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you recall whether there was any blood on the floor at that 
time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Can you tell me with any degree of certainty that there was not 
blood on the floor at that time? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: I didn't see any blood. 
 
BY MR.KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  When you say you took the lock off the front door, you 
mean you just unlocked it? 
 
A: No. You push the little center piece in the inside of the door so 
you could turn the door handle. 
 
Q: Sure.  And after you did that -- did someone ask you to do that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was someone knocking at the door that caused you to go to the 
front door and do that? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Were there any other officers there, other than the four 
detectives, when you came back there the second time? 
 
A: I don't remember if there were any more.  Could have been, but 
I don't know for sure. 
 
Q: By the way, when you arrived there the first time at 
Rockingham, did you see any photographer there? 
 
A: Not to my knowledge. 
 
Q: See anybody with a camera? 
 
A: Not to my knowledge. 
 
Q: When you arrived back there the second time, did you see 
anybody there with a camera? 
 
A: Not to my knowledge. 
 
Q: Did you see anybody there other than the four detectives that 
had been there the first time? 
 
A: I basically concentrated on them because I had the interaction 
with them.  So I wasn't aware of anybody else, if they were there. 
 
Q: Okay.  What happened next after you got Sydney and Justin 
situated where you said you had them? 
 
A: I think I told Vannatter that I'd leave the door open, and then 
him and I were talking --   
 
Q: Who is "him"? 
 
A: Vannatter.  We were talking outside in the hallway.  The front 
door's wide open and --  
 
Q: You left the front door ajar also?  
 
A: No. I had it completely open. 
 
Q: Okay.  And unlocked? 
 
A: Yes, so they could come in and out without disturbing the kids. 
 
Q: As you faced the front door, could you tell me whether that 
opens to the right or opens to the left? 
 
A: Facing it? 
 
Q: From inside the house. 
 
A: It would be open to my left. 
 
Q: Okay.  And do you know --  
 
A: And from inside, is that what --  
 
Q: Yes. As you stand inside in the front hallway facing the front 
door, which way does the door open? 
 
A: It's to the left, to my left. 
 
Q: Okay. I'm sorry. You were telling me, after you got the kids 
situated, you were talking to Vannatter? 
 
A: Yeah, Vannatter and I were in the hallway and -- 
 
Q: Was anybody else there besides you and Vannatter? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: Then all of a sudden we heard Fuhrman say, "I want this looked 
at," and we -- 
 
Q: You look like you're ready to stand up just then, Mr. Cowlings.  
Were you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Getting ready to show me something? 
 
A: No.  Just my motion. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: Just then Vannatter and I both looked towards the door.  
Fuhrman was standing there. Then when I looked back at 
Vannatter, Vannatter says, "We are going to do a search of the 
house, and all of you are going to have to leave." 
 
Q: Where was Fuhrman standing when he said this? 
 
A: He was halfway -- probably he was more outside of the front 
door than inside.  He was pointing down to some area right about 
the front of the door. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was he pointing to an area, if you could tell, outside the 
front door or inside the front door? 
 
A: I would think it was outside the front door. 
 
Q: Could you see what he was pointing at? 
 
A: No, I couldn't, sir. 
 
Q: And what happened after Vannatter said that? 
 
MR. RE: Fuhrman, you mean? 
 
THE WITNESS: After Vannatter? 
 
BY MR.KELLY: 
 
Q: No.  Vannatter, I believe you said -- 
 
A: After we were interrupted, when we both heard that and when I 
looked back at Vannatter, Vannatter said, "We going to" -- "I have 
to do a house search, and everyone is going to have to leave." 
 
Q: Where was Vannatter in relation to you when Fuhrman said 
this? 
 
A: Him and I were right in front of each other.  If you facing that 
kitchen door that I had closed, we were to the left of it. 
 
Q: How far were you in terms of number of feet from the front 
door at that time? 
 
A: Could have been eight feet, ten feet, something like that. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was Vannatter between you and the front door? 
 
A: No.  Vannatter and I were facing -- Vannatter's back was to the 
wall. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: To the wall -- 
 
Q: Would it be fair to say you and Vannatter were equal distance 
from the front door at that time? 
 
A: Yes, I would say so. 
 
Q: Okay.  You could not see what, if anything, Fuhrman was 
pointing to at that time? 
 
A: No, not at that time, no. 
 
Q: Could you tell me what direction he was pointing in as he 
pointed? 
 
A: As he was facing -- it seemed to me as he was facing the door, 
he was in the doorway.  I think he was pointing down to his right, I 
think.  I'm not sure.  But I know he had to be in that area 
somewhere. 
 
Q: But he was pointing towards the ground? 
 
A: Yeah, kinda like, "I want this checked" (Indicating). 
 
Q: That's what he said? 
 
A: Yeah, to those -- well, I don't know exactly, but something like 
to that effect. 
 
Q: Did Vannatter make any move whatsoever prior to making the 
statement you attributed to him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he indicate to you that he could see something that 
Fuhrman was pointing at? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know what Fuhrman was pointing at at that time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know what Vannatter saw that caused him to say they 
were going to have to do a search of the house at that time? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know what he saw.  I know what we both 
heard. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did you ever find out that morning what Fuhrman was pointing 
to by that front door? 
 
A: I did look at it once I was at the house, once all the commotion 
was over with.  Could have been weeks later. 
 
Q: And what did you see? 
 
A: Like some red paint, looked like it to me. 
 
Q: And that was outside the front door? 
 
A: Just in that vicinity where he was suggesting.  Not to say that he 
was referring to that.  I don't know what he was referring to, but 
that's what I noticed. 
 
Q: How many drops did you notice? 
 
A: It wasn't drops.  It was more like a paint smudge.  Looked 
reddish like -- you know, it looked more like paint to me than 
anything. 
 
Q: Okay.  Could you describe to me exactly what you saw in that 
area weeks later? 
 
A: It looked like old paint that had been there.  Could have been 
red from the brick.  Could have been red from, you know, 
something. 
 
Q: Well, how many smudges did you see? 
 
A: I don't know.  They could be still there, for all I know.  I would 
think so. 
 
Q: Do you know for a fact that is what Fuhrman was pointing at? 
 
A: I don't know for a fact that that's what he was pointing at. 
 
Q: That's just your own conclusion, that that's what you think he 
was pointing at? 
 
A: Like I said earlier, I don't know if that's what he was pointing at 
or he saw something else.  I know that's what I saw. 
 
Q: That morning after Detective Fuhrman made that statement, did 
you have occasion immediately thereafter to walk over where he 
was pointing and look? 
 
A: When he made that statement? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Were you allowed to leave through the front door when you left 
the premises? 
 
A: I think we took the kids out of the side because we went out of 
the other door off the kitchen. 
 
Q: As you stood there approximately eight feet from the front door 
and Detective Fuhrman pointed to the ground, did you ever get 
closer than eight feet to that area after that time? 
 
A: That particular day or at any time? 
 
Q: Yeah, that particular day. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  After Vannatter made that initial statement to you about 
having to do a search of the house, what did you do next? 
 
A: I think Arnelle called Denise or -- 'cause first -- when Vannatter 
said that, I was trying to get my thoughts together to where to take 
the kids, either to my place or I was even thinking of maybe taking 
them over to Wayne's or somewhere, you know, close, and I think 
maybe -- or was it...I don't know if Arnelle was talking to Denise or 
if I was talking to Denise.  Denise say, "Why don't you bring them 
here," and I said, "Okay," or I was told I could bring them to the 
Browns.  I don't know exactly. 
 
Q: Do you recall hearing Arnelle talk to Denise? 
 
A: I don't know if I spoke to Denise or Arnelle was speaking to 
Denise. 
 
Q: Okay.  What, if anything, did you think the moment Vannatter 
said they were going to have to do a search of the house? 
 
A: He said, "Everyone's going to have to leave" so I was 
concentrating on, you know, getting the kids. 
 
Q: Did you have any thoughts as to why he was going to do a 
search of the house? 
 
A: My mind was all confused.  I don't know if I gave it any 
thought.  I just reacted.  He said, "Everyone's got to leave the 
house," and so I said, "Okay." 
 
Q: Did you associate that statement Vannatter made to Nicole's 
death in any way? 
 
A: No, I didn't. 
 
Q: Okay.  When you called Wayne Hughes, could you tell me 
what, if anything, you said to him that morning? 
 
A: I told him that Nicole was dead. 
 
Q: Did you tell him anything other than that? 
 
A: He said, "What happened?" or "How?"  And I don't think I had 
the information at the time.  I didn't know.  I said, "I don't know." 
 
Q: When did you get the information as to how Nicole had died? 
 
A: That Nicole was dead?  When Arnelle called me that morning. 
 
Q: Did you ever -- when did you first find out she had been 
murdered? 
 
A: I think maybe -- to be honest with you, I don't know.  I don't 
know if I eventually heard it on the news or I heard it before I left.  
I really don't  know. 
 
Q: Okay. The first time you were at Rockingham, do you have any 
recollection of the phone ringing at all when you were there the 
first time? 
 
A: It could have been ringing.  I don't know if it was or not. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall it ringing at all when you were there the 
second time? 
 
A: I personally did not answer the phone.  I don't remember it 
ringing the second -- I mean, when I was back there the second 
time, because the kids were in the kitchen. 
 
Q: Do you recall whether the first time there any cells were made 
to Mr. Simpson while you were there? 
 
A: I think they did call O.J. once they got in touch -- once they 
found out where he was.  I don't know if Cathy had given them the 
number and they called O.J. or O.J. called the house.  I really don't 
know. 
 
Q: Do you have a recollection of being at Rockingham when one 
or more of the detectives were talking to Mr. Simpson that 
morning? 
 
A: I don't know how many detectives spoke with O.J. 
 
Q: Do you have a recollection of being at Rockingham that 
morning at any time when one of the detectives spoke to Simpson? 
 
A: Pardon? 
 
Q: Do you remember hearing any detectives speaking to Simpson 
on the phone when you were there that morning? 
 
A: I think there was a conversation between O.J. and one of the 
detectives. 
 
Q: Do you know which detective was on the phone talking to 
Simpson? 
 
A: No, I don't. 
 
Q: Do you recall what the detective on the phone with Simpson 
said? 
 
A: No, I don't. 
 
Q: But you recall being there when that phone call -- 
 
A: I think they made contact with O.J. 
 
Q: While you were there at Rockingham? 
 
A: Maybe by the time I got back, they were maybe still on the 
phone, or once I was there.  I don't know really when they made 
actual contact with O.J. 
 
Q: Is it your best recollection that the first time you arrived at 
Rockingham, nobody had spoken to Simpson yet? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know that for sure, sir. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you have any reason to believe when you arrived at 
Rockingham the first time that anybody had spoken to Mr. 
Simpson yet? 
 
A: I didn't give it any thought. 
 
Q: Okay.  Is it your best recollection that by the second time you 
were at Rockingham, though, someone had spoken to Mr. 
Simpson? 
 
A: I think at that time or time given, I think that they made contact 
with O.J. 
 
Q: And you have a recollection of one of the detectives speaking to 
him when you were there? 
 
A: I think so.  One of the detectives was speaking to O.J., had 
informed O.J.  
 
Q: And you can't tell me anything you heard the detective say to 
Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: No, sir.  I always stayed out of their way.  I wasn't -- you know, 
if they were over by the phone, I was like either at the door from 
the hallway to the kitchen or in the hallway. 
 
Q: Okay.  When you left there, you indicated you walked out the 
side kitchen door? 
 
A: Yeah.  Before I left, Vannatter -- I mean Fuhrman said to me, 
"Here's my card" -- no --"Call us when you get there," and 
Vannatter gave me his card and Fuhrman gave me his card. 
 
Q: Okay.  You had indicated that you had other discussions with 
Vannatter also while you were at Rockingham.  Could you tell me 
what those were? 
 
A: I couldn't tell you exactly because I don't remember. 
 
Q: Just generally if you could tell me what you discussed with 
Vannatter . 
 
A: I don't remember.  I wasn't asking him questions.  He was -- I 
don't know when -- I don't know exactly what we were talking 
about in the hallway before we heard Fuhrman. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did any detective ever ask you if you knew where 
Simpson had been the night before? 
 
A: I don't remember that, no. 
 
Q: Do you remember any detective asking you if you knew -- if 
you had spoken to Simpson the night before? 
 
A: I don't remember.  They may have.  They may have asked me 
what was the last time I had seen O.J. 
 
Q: And what did you tell them? 
 
A: I probably told them I had spoken to him, but I hadn't seen him 
in a few weeks. 
 
Q: Were you able to give any detective any information as to Mr. 
Simpson's activities the previous night, June 12th, 1994, when you 
were at Rockingham that morning? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Okay.  When you left the side kitchen door of Rockingham, 
then, where did you go on the property to exit? 
 
A: I walked to the driveway -- walked down the driveway towards 
Ashford with the kids in my arms. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you walk through the Ashford gate? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you make any observations of any blood in the driveway at 
that time? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Any red paint? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Did you see any little white card markers placed anywhere in 
the driveway at that time? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Did anybody caution you to watch your step in any way? 
 
A: No, sir. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was Mr. Kaelin still on the premises when you left with 
the kids? 
 
A: I remember seeing Kato getting into the black-and-white. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you remember seeing him actually exit the residence 
itself, the house? 
 
A: I saw him -- I didn't see him on the grounds.  When I got to the 
gate, I looked to my right and Kato was getting in the back seat of 
a black-and-white. 
 
Q: Do you know what door he exited the house? 
 
A: No, I don't. 
 
Q: Okay.  And what did you do after you got in your car then? 
 
A: I walked Arnelle -- I got the kids in my car, walked Arnelle over 
to a friend who came by to pick her up; I embraced her and I told 
her, you know, to give me a call -- no.  I asked for his number so I 
could, you know, be in touch. 
 
Q: Was that [Name Deleted] , by any chance? 
 
A: Yes.  Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And he was there at Rockingham that morning to pick 
Arnelle up? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Could you tell me approximately what time that was that you 
were leaving Rockingham the second time? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Was it before 7:00 o'clock in the morning? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Was it before 8:00 o'clock in the morning? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Okay.  What, if anything, did you say to [Name Deleted]  at that 
time? 
 
A: I said, "Take care of her," or, you know, something to that 
effect. 
 
Q: Had you known [Name Deleted]  before this morning? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How long had you known him for? 
 
A: I've known him a long time.  Him and Arnelle are probably the 
best of friends. 
 
Q: Did [Name Deleted]  write a phone number down for you? 
 
A: Yeah, I think he gave me the number where he was. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you ever have occasion to call that number that 
morning? 
 
A: Once I got to the Browns' house, I did call to see how she was 
doing.  
 
Q: Okay.  Do you know what time it was when you got to the 
Browns' house? 
 
A: No, I don't. 
 
Q: Did anybody ride down to the Browns' house besides Sydney 
and Justin? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you have a car phone in that Ford Bronco? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you have a cellular phone?  Or did you have a cellular phone 
on June 12th, 1994? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And you had no car phone in your Ford Bronco on June 12th, 
1994? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you stop anywhere between Rockingham and the Browns' 
house in Dana Point that morning when you drove down there? 
 
A: Could I have stopped? 
 
Q: Did you make any stops? 
 
A: No, I didn't make no stops. 
 
Q: Okay. What did you do with -- I am sorry.  Could you tell me 
the first phone call you made when you got down to Browns' house 
that morning of June l3th? 
 
A: I don't remember making any phone calls once I got down there. 
 
Q: Well, I think you had indicated before you made a call to 
Arnelle. 
 
A: I don't know if that was later on in the day or -- you know, I 
don't know if it was -- oh, I take that back.  I did make -- I called 
back to Rockingham to let them know that I had arrived, because 
they wanted me to call back to the house. 
 
Q: Okay.  And who did you speak to when you called back to 
Rockingham? 
 
A: I think it was Fuhrman. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you speak to anybody else that morning of June 
13th other than that last phone call to Detective Fuhrman?  Did you 
speak to anybody on the phone?  I'm sorry. 
 
A: I think Vannatter got on the phone for a few seconds. 
 
Q: Okay. First of all, could you tell me what your phone 
conversation was with Fuhrman when you called back up to 
Rockingham, 
 
A: That we had arrived in Laguna. 
 
Q: Did you tell him anything else? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he ask you anything else? 
 
A: Not that I remember. 
 
Q: Okay.  And what, if anything, did you discuss with Vannatter 
when you made that phone call back up there? 
 
A: I don't know if Vannatter asked me where I could be reached at 
or where I would be.  I told him that I would be at the Browns with 
the kids. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall what time you arrived at the Browns' 
house? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Could you tell me the next time you spoke to [Name Deleted]  
that day? 
 
A: I don't know.  The time when I called to check on Arnelle, he 
answered his own phone, and I said, "This is A.C.," and I said, 
"How's she doing?"  And he said -- I guess he said, "She's all 
right," or whatever. Then he put her on the phone. 
 
Q: And was that in the morning of June 13th? 
 
A: I don't now if it was the morning, late morning or early 
afternoon.  I don't know exactly when. 
 
Q: Do you know how long after you had arrived down at the 
Browns you put a call in to [Name Deleted] ? 
 
A: No, I don't. 
 
Q: Okay.  Could you tell me, on the morning of June 13th, 1994 
did you have any conversation with Cathy Randa? 
 
A: Not to my knowledge.  I don't think I spoke to Cathy at all. 
 
Q: Could you tell me, on the morning of June 13th, 199- -- I am 
sorry.  You look like you are still thinking about it. 
 
A: I'm trying to --  
 
Q: Okay.  Just think about it for a minute. 
 
A: I don't remember if I did or not speak to Cathy. 
 
Q: Could you tell me whether you spoke to Skip Taft on the 
morning of June 13th, l994? 
 
A: That morning I don't remember if I did or not.  I don't -- I don't 
think so because I don't know Skip's home number by heart.  I 
know his office number by heart, but I don't know his home 
number. 
 
Q: Did you speak to Robert Kardashian at all the morning of June 
13th, 1994? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Could you tell me the first time you spoke to Mr. Simpson -- 
Did you speak to Mr. Simpson at all on June 13th, 1994? 
 
A: Privilege. 
 
MR.PETROCELLI: What was the question? 
 
MR. GROMAN: Did he speak to Simpson. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No --

conversations with Mr. Simpson prior to his arrival back from 
Chicago on June 13th, 1994? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: No, you did not? 
 
A: Wednesday --  
 
MR. RE: Wait a second.  The question is, before he arrived back 
and -- between the time that you heard about the killing until the 
time that he returned to Los Angeles. 
 
THE WITNESS: Oh, no. No.   
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: You had no conversations --  
 
A: No conversations. 
 
Q: -- with Mr. Simpson.  Could you tell me who, if anybody, you 
spoke to on the telephone prior to Mr. Simpson's arrival back to 
Los Angeles on June 13th, 1994? 
 
A: Who I spoke with? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
MR. RE: You mean other than the people he's talked about? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Yeah, other than the people we've talked about already. 
 
A: Wayne.  Wayne stands out in my mind, I'm sure of.  I don't 
know if I talked to anybody else.  
 
Q: You don't remember talking to Cathy Randa? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Do you remember whether you talked to Skip Taft? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Do you remember whether you spoke to Robert Kardashian? 
 
A: No, I didn't speak to Robert. 
 
Q: Okay.  Could you tell me -- could you describe -- Well, who was 
at Browns when you arrived  at the Browns that morning? 
 
A: The family. 
 
Q: Lou was there? 
 
A: Lou, Judy, Tanya, Dominique, I think, and Denise.  And Aaron 
and Sean. 
 
Q: Okay.  And could you describe the situation there when you 
arrived there that morning? 
 
A: Very sad with us.  I don't know what Sean and Aaron knew, but 
they responded to their two cousins and they started jumping up 
and down and playing, but the rest of us was pretty taken. 
 
Q: Do you recall any conversation you had with Lou Brown that 
morning when you arrived there? 
 
A: We probably talked -- what we talked about initially when we 
first got there, I don't remember. 
 
Q: Do you recall having any conversations with Judy Brown when 
you got there this morning -- that morning? 
 
A: Right when we got there?  Eventually we did talk. 
 
Q: Could you tell me the substance of that conversation? 
 
A: She was very upset.  Nobody knew no more than what we all 
knew, that Nicole was dead.  She seemed to be scared. 
 
Q: Upset? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Crying? 
 
A: Yes.  She made a statement, ""Why"" -- I think she was talking 
to Lou.  She says, "Why we gave" -- "Why didn't they take me " or 
"Why" -- something to the effect that she would trade places. 
 
Q: Did you have any conversations with Denise that morning? 
 
A: Yeah, I think we did talk.  About what, I don't know.  I don't 
remember. 
 
Q: No recollection of that conversation? 
 
A: Everything, like I said, was very confusing, very difficult time. 
 
Q: Do you recall having any conversations with Lou Brown 
regarding Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Do you recall having any conversations with Judy Brown 
regarding Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: I think Judy did mention things, mentioned O.J.  In what frame 
I don't remember, because Judy and I talked a lot that day, so I 
don't know where all of it falls in. 
 
Q: Was there any discussion of Mr. Simpson having killed Nicole 
when you spoke to Judy that day? 
 
A: It was discussions.  I think she asked me something to that 
effect.  I don't know if she said, "Did he do it?" or "Do you think 
he did it?" or -- she was very -- very taken. 
 
Q: Do you recall what your response was to those questions? 
 
A: At that time I didn't know anything.  I don't know if I said if I 
didn't know or -- I don't know for sure what I said. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you know at that time whether or not Mr. Simpson 
had murdered Nicole? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay, why don't we break here.

<P>Al Cowlings continued to assert his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination on April 26, 1996, the third day of his deposition. "Why don't you just give me immunity, and I can answer these questions for you," Cowling told the plaintiffs' lawyers. Two months later, Judge Alan Haber denied granting Cowlings limited immunity against prosecution. Cowlings finished his deposition on May 15. Judge Haber's ruling means that Cowlings does not have to answer further questions in a deposition.</P>

EXAMINATION (Resumed)  
 
BY MR. KELLY: Good morning, Mr. Cowlings.  
 
A: Morning. 
 
Q: How you doing? 
 
A: Fine. 
 
Q: Good. Mr. Cowlings, have you spoken to anybody since last Wednesday 
when you left here regarding the testimony you have given us to date? 
 
A: No. Except my lawyer. 
 
Q: Other than Mr. Re, have you spoken to anybody? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you spoken to Mr. Simpson since last Wednesday -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- when you left here? I'm sorry? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. RE: I should make it clear, I have asked him not to speak to Mr. Simpson -- 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
MR. RE: -- during the pendency of this deposition. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay, great. 
 
Q: And you recall that you have asserted what we have referred to as the 
privilege a number of  times the last couple days when asked questions? 
 
A: Pertaining to 
 
Q: Certain events. 
 
A: Certain dates. 
 
Q: Certain dates? 
 
A: (Nods head.) 
 
Q: Yes. And would you be willing to testify fully regarding those dates if given 
immunity by the District Attorney's Office? 
 
MR. RE: I don't think he would have any choice. The only quarrel I have is 
when you say, "immunity by the District Attorney's Office," you mean given 
immunity -- 
 
MR. KELLY: From criminal prosecution. 
 
MR. RE: Theoretically, the immunity would come from the court as opposed to 
the District Attorney's Office. 
 
MR. KELLY: Right. 
 
MR. RE: Okay. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. How long have you known Robert Kardashian, Mr. Cowlings? 
 
A: Quite a long time. I think we met in the early '70s. 
 
Q: And where did you meet him? 
 
A: I actually met Bob through O.J., met Bob and his brother. All of us just 
started -- well, myself, I had just started playing tennis, and they were very nice 
to invite us over to play tennis with them. 
 
Q: What's Bob's brother's name? 
 
A: Tom. Tom Kardashian. 
 
Q: And you used to spend a lot of time at the Kardashian's place? 
 
A: Yeah, there, and we would frequent -- we would go out to dinner, you know. 
Great family. 
 
Q: Okay. And what about his first wife Chris, did you know her? 
 
A: Yes, knew Chris well. 
 
Q: And when did you first meet her? 
 
A: I guess when her and Bob started dating. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall approximately what year that was? 
 
A: Still in the '70s, probably mid '70s, I would think. I don't know for sure. She 
was an airline stewardess when they met, and I helped her move, too, eventually 
when she moved out of her apartment in the Valley. 
 
Q: Okay. When you first met Bob Kardashian, do you know what type of 
employment he was involved in, what his profession was? 
 
A: I think he was a lawyer. 
 
Q: Okay. Did he ever do any legal work or provide any legal services on your 
behalf? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. And when you met him in the early `70s, you indicated you met him 
through Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And do you know what Mr. Simpson's relationship was with Bob Kardashian 
back then? 
 
MR LEONARD: Objection.  Lack of foundation, calls for speculation. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Other than that, you can answer. 
 
A: Bob, as when I met Bob, turned out that he went to USC, too, and he had 
been the head manager of the football team, which the head manager is like an 
assistant to the coach, to the head coach -- 
 
Q: That was while he was still a student there? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: So the connection is USC, and by the fact of O.J. being very successful there 
and being a Heisman Trophy winner, I guess when Bob -- and I don't know 
exactly where they met, but that was the common denominator for them. 
 
Q: But when you met Kardashian in a social -- You met him in a social setting. 
Is that correct? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. And did you used to socialize with both Kardashian and Simpson? 
 
A: At times, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever even see a business card for Mr. Kardashian? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did Mr. Simpson ever talk to you about using Mr. Kardashian as an 
attorney? 
 
A: I don't know, to be honest with you. I know they were great friends. I know 
O.J. eventually -- I think his first office was in Bob's building, and -- yeah, 
something like that. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know if Mr. Simpson ever used Mr. Kardashian in a legal 
capacity? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Not that I know of. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. You don't know of any time Mr. Kardashian provided legal services to 
Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: Not -- 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Same objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: Not that I know of. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. When did you first meet Skip Taft? 
 
A: I met Skip probably my -- probably in the early '70s. He -- my manager at the 
time was a gentleman by the name of Chuck Barnes, who was the same agent -- 
he was the agent -- O.J. wasthat was his agent, too. Skip and I think Chuck 
had been friends through college. 
 
Q: So when you signed out of college, you used Chuck Barnes as an agent? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And Simpson had used Chuck Barnes a year before when he signed out of 
college? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever -- Strike that. Did Skip Taft ever provide you with legal 
services, ever? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you spend much -- Did you meet Mr. Taft through Simpson? 
 
A: I would say I met him through Chuck Barnes when my -- when I became a 
client of Sports -- I think it was Sports Headliners, Incorporated, something like 
that. 
 
Q: Okay. And would you be able to tell me what the relationship was, as you 
understood it, between Skip Taft and Simpson? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. It's vague. Lack of foundation. Calls for 
speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: At that time I don't know. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know whether Mr. Taft was a business advisor of Mr. 
Simpson? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Same objections. 
 
THE WITNESS: I think he was employed by Sports -- I mean by the agency at 
the time. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: That Taft was? 
 
A: I think so. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know whether he provided any business services to Mr. 
Simpson? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Same objections. 
 
THE WITNESS: I think he was there for Sports Headliners and whoever clients 
they had. I don't know if it was all of us or just certain ones. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know whether Mr. Taft ever provided legal services to Mr. 
Simpson? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Same objections. 
 
THE WITNESS: Eventually, when O.J. broke away from Sports Headliners, I 
think Skip at that time became his lawyer in whatever capacity that Skip is 
working for O.J. for. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. What about Ahmad Rashad, how long have you known him for? 
 
MR. LEONARD: I didn't hear the question. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Ahmad Rashad, how long have you known him for, first of all? 
 
A: I've been knowing him for quite a long time. We knew of each other through 
college. He was at Oregon while I was at USC. 
 
Q: Okay. And were you friends even in college? 
 
A: No. We started to become friends once I think he got out of Oregon. He had 
moved to Los Angeles. 
 
Q: Okay. And do you know what Rashad's relationship was with Simpson? 
 
A: Friends. 
 
Q: Still friends to this day?  
 
A: Far as I know. 
 
Q: Okay. We had spoken a little bit about Wayne Hughes the other day. Did you 
have any business dealings with Wayne Hughes? 
 
A: Wayne is one of my closest friends. I have been involved with some of -- 
when Wayne first started his company, he got me -- he had me to invest in it. 
 
Q: Public Storage?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And you did invest in it?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you work for Public Storage for a number of years? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And you still talk to Wayne Hughes regularly? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When was the last time you spoke to him? 
 
A: What's today, Friday? 
 
MR. RE: Uh-huh. 
 
THE WITNESS: Spoke to him Wednesday. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did you discuss anything with regard to the deposition that you've -- where 
you've been giving the testimony here today? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Did he indicate that he knew you were in the middle of your 
deposition testimony when  you 
spoke to him? 
 
A: I guess everybody knows through the leaks in here. Geraldo gets it before 
anybody. 
 
Q: I didn't know anybody knew. 
 
A: Oh, I bet you don't. 
 
Q: When -- Has Mr. Simpson been friends with Wayne Hughes for as long as 
you have, also? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did Mr. Simpson invest in Public Storage in the same manner you did, if you 
know? 
 
A: That I don't know. 
 
Q: Have Simpson and Hughes been long-time friends? 
 
A: Yes.

in jail after Simpson's initial incarceration?

had had with Mr. Simpson in jail? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Mr. Hughes ever indicate to you that he was going to go speak to Mr. 
Simpson in jail? 
 
A: When you say "speak" -- 
 
Q: Visit him. 
 
A: Oh, yeah, he was going to visit O.J., yes. 
 
Q: Did he tell you he was going to? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did Mr. Hughes ever tell you what he was going to speak to Mr. Simpson 
about when he visited him? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did Mr. Hughes express -- ever express to you that he was unhappy with 
what was going on in the media with regard to Nicole Brown Simpson? 
 
A: He was very unhappy with all of it. 
 
Q: I am asking you specifically now: Did he indicate to you that he was very 
unhappy with what was going on in the media with regard to Nicole? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: He didn't say specifically anyone. He was just very upset with 
all of it, the whole picture of it, what the media was doing. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did he ever indicate to you that he felt that Mr. Simpson was responsible for 
a lot of the negative media reports that were coming out about Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Mr. Hughes ever indicate to you that he was going to go speak to Mr. 
Simpson about all the negative media that was coming out regarding Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Mr. Hughes ever indicate to you afterwards that he had spoken to Mr. 
Simpson about the negative media coming out about Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Did Mr. Hughes ever ask you if you could do anything to control all of 
the negative publicity coming out about Nicole? 
 
A: I wish I could have. No. 
 
Q: Okay. Who is Mark Packer? 
 
A: Mark Packer is a friend that lived on -- lives on the East Coast. 
 
Q: New York? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And where do you know him from? 
 
A: I met Mark Packer through a friend of mine out here by the name of Alan 
Schwartz. 
 
Q: And Schwartz is from back East also? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And Schwartz knew Packer before he moved out here to the West Coast? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know what kind of work Packer does here in the East Coast? 
 
A: I think he's in the restaurant business. He owns a number of restaurants back 
on the East Coast.  
 
Q: When was the last time you spoke to Packer? 
 
A: It's been a while. 
 
Q: Have you spoke to him since Simpson's release? 
 
A: I think I spoke to Packer when I was back on the East Coast working. 
 
Q: Do you know whether he and Mr. Simpson still maintain a relationship -- a 
friendship? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: That I don't know. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Were Simpson and Packer friends at one time? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know whether they are friends now or not? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: As far as I know, yes. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. How long have you known Cathy Randa? 
 
A: I've known Cathy for a long time. She used to work for Bob Kardashian. 
 
Q: And in what capacity did she work for Kardashian? 
 
A: She was his assistant. 
 
Q: And as an assistant, what type of work did she do for Kardashian? 
 
A: I guess answering phones, type, took dictation, made appointments. 
Whatever assistant's duties are for, she provided. 
 
Q: Do you know what type of work Kardashian was doing that Cathy Randa 
was assisting in? 
 
A: He was a lawyer. 
 
Q: Do you know anything else he did besides lawyering? 
 
A: Him and his brother had started or bought into a newspaper called R & R, 
which is Radio & Records. It's a public -- a news publication that deals with the 
radio stations across the nation. 
 
Q: Did you personally know of anybody who Bob Kardashian provided legal 
services for? 
 
MR. LEONARD: At any time? 
 
THE WITNESS: At any time? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: At any time. 
 
A: He did get into -- briefly he got into representing ballplayers. 
 
Q: Do you know any ballplayer he represented? 
 
A: The names slip me now. This was early on. 
 
Q: Just like that girlfriend in San Francisco in '79? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object. Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: I answered that question. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: I know. Think you might remember those ballplayers' names later on? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know if he represented them in a agent capacity or a legal capacity? 
 
A: I was -- I -- 
 
MR. LEONARD: I am going to object to that as lack of foundation and asking 
him to speculate. 
 
THE WITNESS: I'd just be guessing. Like I say, I don't know exactly what he 
did for them. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Other than briefly representing ballplayers, do you know of any legal-related 
work he ever did? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I would be guessing. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Going back to Cathy Randa now, how long did she work for Bob 
Kardashian? 
 
A: Long time. I think when Bob -- I don't know if he went full time over to R & 
R or -- whenever he went full time to R &: R, I guess he -- trying to think. That 
would have been... I really don't know. She worked for him for quite a long 
time. 
 
Q: Okay. And do you know where she went to work after she left Kardashian? 
 
A: I think she went to work for O.J. 
 
Q: And did you have a social relationship with Cathy Randa? 
 
A: What do you mean by "social"? 
 
Q: Well, did you ever see her at like parties at Simpson's house? 
 
A: We were friends. I guess she could have been at the house on some events 
that O.J. and Nicole would host. 
 
Q: Would you be able to tell me in what capacity she worked for Simpson? 
 
A: She was O.J.'s assistant. 
 
Q: Do you know what type of work she did for him? 
 
A: She choreographed: She ran his office, made his appointments. 
 
Q: Do you know whether or not she took care of his personal matters also as 
part of her job? 
 
A: When you say -- 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. Calling for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: What do you mean by "personal"? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Well, do you know whether she was responsible for paying the bills for his 
house? 
 
A: I don't think so. 
 
Q: Do you know whether she kept his social calendar? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation, call for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: She probably did, yeah. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Do you know whether Simpson relied on her heavily in terms of running his 
everyday affairs? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation, calls for speculation, and is 
vague. 
 
THE WITNESS: He was paying her. I guess he did. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did he mention her often? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague. 
 
THE WITNESS: Cathy was a very good friend of O.J., too, besides, you know, 
working for him. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did you ever have to coordinate things through Cathy, if you were dealing 
with Mr. Simpson, in terms of appointments and things like that? 
 
A: If I wanted to find out if he was in town or if he was going to be in town 
somewhere, Cathy would be the one that I would call. 
 
Q: Would she always have his travel itinerary available? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. Yes. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
151 Q: Okay. Did you know Paula Barbieri at all? 
 
A: Vaguely. 
 
Q: What do you mean by "vaguely"? 
 
A: I didn't know her that well.  
 
Q: Had you had occasion to see her in the last, say, two months prior to Nicole's 
murder in June of 1994? 
 
A: I may have. I don't know for sure. I remember seeing her in January during 
the Super Bowl, during that whole week. 
 
Q: Was she with Simpson at that time? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where was the Super Bowl that year? 
 
A: It was in Los Angeles that year, out to Pasadena.  That wasn't the year? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: (Shakes head.) 
 
THE WITNESS: What year was that? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I think it was in Atlanta. 
 
THE WITNESS: Oh, that's about the most time I ever spent with her, so it could 
have been the year before. Like I say, I didn't see a lot of Paula. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: But you have a recollection of seeing her at one of the Super Bowls? 
 
A: When the Super Bowl was played here in Los Angeles, yes. 
 
Q: Where did you see her with Simpson that week? 
 
A: She -- everybody was down. His family was down from Los -- I mean from 
San Francisco, his mother, his sister, his brother-in-law. NBC was doing the 
Super Bowl that particular year. I guess that was '8- -- '93 then? '93? So -- and 
friends were in from out of town. It was a big, big event, and --  
 
Q: Was Simpson her escort for that week for those affairs? 
 
A: He was working. I mean, you know, he was doing his -- the interviews with 
both of the teams. I think it was Buffalo and -- and the Dallas Cowboys played 
that year, I think. 
 
MR. RE: Who won? 
 
THE WITNESS: Dallas.   So she -- I was around the house a lot during that 
period, so that's probably the most I've ever spent that much time around Paula. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: And your best recollection is that it was in January of '93? 
 
A: If that's when the Super Bowl was played here, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. I had asked you briefly once before about Joe Stellini. 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: And you had indicated that you had seen him in The Daisy before.  Is that 
correct? 
 
A: Yes. The Daisy club? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: The Daisy, the Luau, at his house for dinner. We played tennis. We jog. Joe 
and I did a lot of things together. 
 
Q: Do you recall whether he was working at The Daisy club back in '79? 
 
A: Not that I know of. 
 
Q: Do you know if he was ever manager there? 
 
A: Not that I know of. 
 
Q: Would you be able to remember who he was dating back then? 
 
A: Probably was Vicky. I think it was Vicky. I don't know her last name. 
 
Q: Can you think of Stellini's girlfriend before Vicky, what her name might 
have been? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to "might have been." Calls for speculation. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did Stellini have a girlfriend before Vicky? 
 
A: Oh, let me back up. Let me back up. Let me back up. You said in '79. I don't 
think he was going with Vicky then. I think he -- that's when he opened his 
restaurant. Him and Donna was still married. So I don't want to hear that on 
"Geraldo" tonight. 
 
Q: Missing the time, anyway. 
 
A: Oh, yeah you got time. 
 
Q: Was -- since this is just --  
 
A: Please, I mean, please, in all honesty, he eventually did go with Vicky, but it 
wasn't in '79. He was still married, happily, with Donna. 
 
Q: One other question following up on that:  Was there another young lady that 
came into Mr. Stelleni's life after Vicky, then, that you can recall? 
 
A: When he eventually started going with  Vicky? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Him and Vicky went together for a long time. I don't know. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know who Stellini's current wife is? 
 
A: Joe is not married. 
 
Q: Has he been married other than the time he was married to Donna? 
 
A: That's the only marriage I knew of. 
 
Q: What about McCullum, how long have you known Tom McCullum for? 
 
A: Off and on for a number of years. O.J. and I started a social softball game 
during the summer -- during the off-season, and eventually it worked into where 
we -- it became a standard thing during the off-season that we'd play softball 
games on the weekends, and we had -- the Daisy had put together a team. Jack -- 
what was his name? He's passed away. He was the owner of The Daisy --  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Hanson? 
 
THE WITNESS: Hanson, right. Jack Hanson put together -- he was very athletic 
and very sports-minded, so they put together a softball team, and I think that's 
how I met Tom, was after one of the games Jack had invited both teams over to 
his house for like cold drinks and what have you, and he lived on Rodeo, I 
think, and he had a tennis court, and Tom was out there, and Tom was a 
tremendous tennis player. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Do you know how long he had been friends with Simpson for? 
 
A: I guess some time. I couldn't put a definite, you know, date on it. I don't 
know -- everybody knew each other. 
 
Q: What type of work did McCullum do? 
 
A: I couldn't tell you. 
 
Q: What about Ornstein, do you know him? 
 
A: Yeah, Mike Ornstein, yeah. 
 
Q: How long did you know him for? 
 
A: When Mike moved down to -- when the Raiders moved down to Los 
Angeles, he was employed by the Los Angeles Raiders, and at that time 
Stellini's restaurant was a very well-known restaurant for, you know, a lot of 
sports figures. 
 
Q: And you'd see Ornstein in there? 
 
A: He came in, yeah. Yeah. I mean, I eventually met him there. I guess he had 
been there a number of times, but I was in there one night, and we introduced 
each other. I knew of him. He knew of me. 
 
Q: Did Ornstein spend a lot of time with Simpson? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, social events.  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Do you know what Mike Ornstein's wife's name is? 
 
A: His wife now? 
 
Q: Well, first of all, his wife then.  
 
MR. LEONARD: When is "then"?  
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, when you say "then" --  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: When did you first meet Ornstein? 
 
A: It's when the Raiders moved to Los Angeles. 
 
Q: Early '70s? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: '83. 
 
MR. KELLY: '83? There you go. 
 
THE WITNESS: I'd be lost without you. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: He was lost without you for a while. 
 
A: I don't think Mike was married then. If he was, I had no knowledge of it. 
 
Q: Is he married now? 
 
A: Yes, he's married now. 
 
Q: And do you know his wife's name?  
 
A: Christian or Chris, something like that. 
 
Q: What about Kolkowitz?  
 
A: Koko?  
 
Q: Yeah.  
 
A: Joe? Yeah, knew Joe.  
 
Q: How long have you known Joe for? 
 
A: I probably met Joe the same time I met  Tom. A tremendous tennis player. 
Him and Tom would -- matter of fact, that particular day over at Jack Hanson, 
they were playing against each other. 
 
Q: By the way, did you happen to see Kolkowitz over at Schwartz's house New 
Year's Day, '89? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: You don't recall seeing him that morning over there? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Do you know whether he picked up Simpson at Schwartz's house that New 
Year's Day morning of '89? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation, calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did Schwartz tell you that Kolkowitz had taken Simpson off somewhere 
from his house? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Do you know Ron Fischman at all?  
 
A: Cora's husband? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Met him one or two times. 
 
Q: Ever write any prescriptions out for you? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: Is that what he does?  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: I am asking you. Did he ever --  
 
A: I don't know what Ron Fischman does. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know Toni Kitaen?  
 
A: Tawny Kitaen? 
 
Q: Tawny. 
 
A: Yeah, I know Tawny. 
 
Q: And where do you know her from? 
 
A: I guess through O.J. 
 
Q: And what was O.J.'s relationship with her --  
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: -- if there was one?  
 
A: Friends. 
 
Q: Anything more than that? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: No, I that take back. I take that back. I met Tawny through 
Marcus. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. What year was that? 
 
A: I couldn't tell you. 
 
Q: Was it in the '80s? 
 
A: Probably, yeah, in the '80s. 
 
Q: Early '80s? 
 
A: That I couldn't tell you. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know whether Mr. Simpson was ever romantically involved 
with Miss Kitaen? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation --  
 
THE WITNESS: Not to my knowledge. 
 
MR. LEONARD: -- calls for speculation. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: I am sorry? 
 
A: Not to my knowledge. 
 
Q: Simpson never told you he was? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: And Kitaen never told you she was? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What was the relationship between Miss Kitaen and Cathy Randa, if any?  
 
A: I think they friends. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
(Discussion held off the record.)  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Do you recognize that picture?  
 
A: I recognize the person, yes. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. That's Exhibit 177 that we are viewing right now. 
 
Q: And who do you recognize that to be? 
 
A: O.J. 
 
Q: Okay. And does that appear to be a fair and accurate representation of Mr. 
Simpson as you know him? 
 
A: Facially, yes. 
 
Q: Other than facially, is there anything else in that picture that strikes you as 
inaccurate? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection -- 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know -- 
 
MR. RE: Wait. Wait. Wait. The problem is that everybody knows that there is a 
big dispute going on as to whether this is a legitimate picture, so you are asking 
him to speculate about what he knows. 
 
MR. KELLY: I am just asking him, based on his own observation, if there is 
anything that doesn't look accurate in that picture. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: In all due respect, Mr. Re, I am not aware of any major 
dispute regarding the authenticity of that picture. 
 
MR. RE: You should watch "Geraldo." 
 
THE WITNESS: May I make a statement? 
 
MR. LEONARD: No. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You don't control the witness, Mr. Leonard. Go ahead. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. What I'm saying, I assume you got this from the tabloids? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: That particular --  
 
A: This particular one.  
 
Q: -- copy, yes. 
 
A: And I know for a fact that they have in the past doctored a lot of their 
pictures, and in one instance they doctored a picture of Nicole once on their 
front page. So what I'm telling you, what I know from here (Indicating), yes, 
that's O.J. Anywhere down from there (Indicating), I don't know. 
 
Q: You don't recognize that --  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- physique? That doesn't appear to be his physique from the neck down? 
 
A: Facially that's O.J. Simpson. 
 
Q: And your testimony is that the body is not O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: I don't know whose body it is.  
 
Q: Is it your testimony that --  
 
A: I don't know whose body it is. 
 
Q: Mr. Cowlings, you have to let me finish answering the question. 
 
MR. RE: You mean asking the question? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Asking. 
 
MR. KELLY: Asking the question. 
 
Q: Is it your testimony that from the neck down that is not Mr. Simpson's body 
portrayed in that picture? 
 
MR. RE: Wait a second. You know, you're badgering him now. He told you 
several times he doesn't know whose body. Now you are asking him if he's 
saying it's not the body. He doesn't know whose body it is. 
 
MR. KELLY: Mr. Re, I am not badgering him at all. He said that basically that 
it's not Mr. Simpson's body. 
 
MR. RE: No, he didn't. He said, "I don't know whose body it is." He said it three 
times. I don't know how much more clear you can make it. 
 
MR. KELLY: Well, I'm trying to make it just a little bit clearer. 
 
Q: Is it your testimony that that does not appear to be Mr. Simpson's body?  
 
A: I don't know whose body it is. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I am going to object -- 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Does it appear to be Mr. Simpson's body? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: I do not know whose body it is. It could be your body, for all I 
know. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Well, you've known Mr. Simpson for about 40 years, haven't you? 
 
A: That's right. 
 
Q: Okay. And you know his build?  
 
A: That's right. 
 
Q: You know his physique?  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Does that appear to be his body, his physique, as you know it, as you sit here 
today, in that picture? 
 
A: I do not know whose body that is. 
 
Q: But you are not satisfied that that is Mr. Simpson's body in that picture.  
 
A: I do not know whose body that is. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: Anything with tabloids, I don't know. 
 
Q: Going back to June 18th, 1994, Mr. Cowlings, could you tell me where you 
went after you had been booked and posted bail? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Do you remember being booked and then being released from the LAPD? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And was that in the early morning hours of June 18th, 1994? 
 
A: I'm quite sure you got the record. Whatever time they released me, that's the 
time I left. Early morning. 
 
Q: By the way, who posted bail for you? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Do you know how much your bail was? 
 
A: They said something like 250,000. 
 
Q: And you have no idea who posted that for you? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did you have 250,000 at that time, Mr. Cowlings? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did -- do you know who made the arrangements for that bail to be posted for 
you? 
 
A: I spoke to my lawyer. 
 
Q: Was that Mr. Re at the time? 
 
A: He called me. 
 
Q: And you never learned after the fact who had posted that bail for you? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: And it's your testimony, as you sit here today, you don't know who put up a 
quarter million l dollars for you to be released from jail that day? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: Don't remember. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. That was a rather memorable day for you, wasn't it, Mr. Cowlings? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative. 
 
MR. RE: Assert a privilege about the date other than the fact -- you are talking 
about the release. Now you are going back into the day. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. After you had been released that day on the 18th, could you tell me 
where you first went? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did you go home? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did you go to Mr. Simpson's house? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you go to Mr. Shapiro's office? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Mr. Taft's office? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know where you went that day? 
 
A: Don't remember. 
 
Q: What is your next recollection of where you might have been that day? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: For the record, what day is this? 
 
MR. KELLY: June 18th. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: After you had been released on the 18th, could you tell me the next time -- or 
the first time you spoke to Mr. Shapiro? 
 
A: I don't know exactly when I spoke with him or what day or -- but I did 
eventually speak with Bob Shapiro. 
 
Q: Could you tell me approximately how many days after you had been released 
you first spoke to Mr. Shapiro? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Could you approximate for me?  
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did you go to his office to speak to him? 
 
MR. RE: Ever? 
 
THE WITNESS: No. I went --  
 
MR. KELLY: Excuse me? 
 
MR. RE: Ever? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Ever after June 18th, after you were released, did you ever go to Mr. Shapiro 
to speak to him at his office?  
 
A: Yes, I had been to his office once.  
 
Q: Could you tell me what month that was? 
 
A: I don't remember the exact month. 
 
Q: Was it June after your release?  
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: How long were you at his office for? 
 
A: 15, 20 minutes, I guess. 
 
Q: Could you tell me what you spoke of about? 
 
A: Not to talk to the media. 
 
Q: Anything other than that in that  20 minutes? 
 
A: I think I was asking him how O.J. was doing. 
 
Q: And what did he tell you?   
 
A: Said he was doing fine. 
 
Q: Did you discuss the facts and circumstances surrounding Nicole's murder at 
all with him? 
 
A: I don't remember that. 
 
Q: Did you talk about any defense strategy with him or where he thought Mr. 
Simpson's case was going at that time? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Compound. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Prior to going to Mr. Shapiro's office, had you spoken to him by phone? 
 
A: Yes. I think. I know I did. When I did, I don't remember. I remember him 
and I spoken, I think I told you last week, when we called some of  Nicole's 
friends. 
 
Q: Was this when he was trying to get Cici or Robin on conference calls? 
 
A: I think he wanted to set up a meeting with them. 
 
Q: Okay. Other than that conversation which you already testified to, did you 
have any other telephone conversations with Mr. Shapiro? 
 
MR. LEONARD: During that time period, John?  When are we talking about? 
 
MR. KELLY: Any time after June 18th. 
 
THE WITNESS: I know I met him at his house once. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: When was that? 
 
A: I couldn't give you a date, but it was over -- it was over a weekend. I 
remember it was -- I don't know if it was a Saturday or a Sunday. 
 
Q: Was that during the trial? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was it before the trial had started? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And do you recall what you spoke to him about at that time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you speak to him at all regarding Mr. Simpson's being accused of this 
murder of Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Had you been invited over by Mr. Shapiro? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Could you tell me what month this was in? 
 
A: No, I couldn't tell you. 
 
Q: Could you tell me who else was there? 
 
A: Just him and I. 
 
Q: And how long were you there for? 
 
A: For a while. 
 
Q: More than 20 minutes? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: More than an hour? 
 
A: Could have been. A little less than an hour. 
 
Q: Okay. Could you tell me in general terms what you and Mr. Shapiro spoke 
about that day?   
 
A: We had lunch, and then he showed me a film of his boxing.  He's a boxing 
fan, and he had sparred with -- the guy was a championship fighter, lightweight 
champion.  Through some way he got -- he sparred with the guy for three 
rounds. The guy bit him on the shoulder or something like that. 
 
Q: Bit Shapiro on the shoulder? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: I suppose this is why Mr. Shapiro had you over to lunch: To show you this 
film. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: He showed it to me. I don't know if that was his reason for 
having me come over there. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Was there anything else -- was there anything you discussed that day while 
you were over at Mr. Shapiro's house, Mr. Cowlings? 
 
A: Well, I had known Bob before this case even started, so we probably talked 
about, you know, friends or whatever. 
 
Q: So his inviting you had nothing to do with his representation of Mr. 
Simpson? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: He probably asked me something,  but I don't remember what 
it was because, like I said, Bob and I have had a relationship before this thing 
happened. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: When was the first time after -- Strike that. Other than the one conversation 
you had  with Marcus Allen out at Wayne Hughes' house, had you had any other 
conversation with Marcus Allen after June 17th -- or 18th after your release and 
before this conversation at Wayne Hughes' house? 
 
A: We have spoken a few times since then. 
 
Q: In between that time period?   
 
A: After. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you speak to Marcus Allen at  any time after your release and 
before you saw him at  Wayne Hughes' house? 
 
A: Before my release? 
 
Q: No. After your release but before you spoke to him at Wayne Hughes' house, 
had you spoken to him at all? 
 
A: Before my release -- after my release --  
 
Q: Right. 
 
A: Between the time I saw him --  
 
Q: Out by the corrals that day. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was there anytime between June 13th and June 17th you spoke to Marcus 
Allen? 
 
A: Marcus -- yes, he called me from -- he was vacationing somewhere. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall which date that was? 
 
A: I think he was -- I don't know exactly where. It could have been on an island 
or whatever.  He had -- when he found out the news, he called me, what had 
happened. 
 
Q: Could you tell me the substance of that  conversation? 
 
A: He was in shock. 
 
Q: Did he ask you any questions about what  had happened? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Do you recall what he asked you?   
 
A: "What happened?" How it happened, just -- it was -- he was just in total 
shock. 
 
Q: What did you tell Marcus Allen had happened? 
 
A: I didn't know any more than what had been  said over the TV: That Nicole 
was dead, and later on  I found out over the media that it was a second  person. 
 
Q: What did you tell Marcus Allen when he asked you how it had happened? 
 
A: I don't think I knew at that time. 
 
Q: Was this on June 13th you spoke to Marcus Allen? 
 
A: I don't know when, if it was June 13 or  the day after or it was -- it could have 
been June 13. Could have been that following day. I really don't remember. 
 
Q: Did you discuss Mr. Simpson at all that time you had the discussion with Mr. 
Allen? 
 
A: We could have. No, wait a minute. Hold it. Back up. No, I didn't talk to 
Marcus. No, I didn't talk to Marcus until some days after. Yeah, because now I 
remember, because I wasn't at home.  There was no way I had --  there was no 
way he could  have gotten in touch with me because I wasn't home, if he had 
called me, because I wasn't there. 
 
Q: You were at the Browns' on the 13th. 
 
A: Right.   
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: And I wouldn't have had no way of getting in touch with him because I didn't 
know where he was. 
 
Q: Would you tell me -- 
 
A: I shouldn't say, "I didn't know where he  was." I wouldn't have known how to 
get in touch with  him where he was. 
 
Q: Do you have a better read on this l conversation now you had with Marcus 
Allen? 
 
A: I think eventually when I spoke with him, because from where he was, I 
guess the information  they got was very little, and he asked me things that -- 
like I said, I didn't know no more than what had already had been said. 
 
Q: Well, what did he ask you? You said he asked you "things." What did he ask 
you? 
 
A: You know, that he had heard; he was very sad; he was shocked; you know, 
what happened. I told him I didn't know. 
 
Q: Did he ask you if Simpson murdered Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he ask you if Simpson had anything to do with Nicole's murder? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you tell Marcus that Simpson was a suspect at that time? 
 
A: I don't remember if I did. 
 
Q: When did you first find out that Simpson  was a suspect to Nicole's murder? 
 
A: Sometime during that week. 
 
Q: It was before the 17th, wasn't it? 
 
A: He had been questioned. I don't know if he was a suspect, but he had been 
questioned by the authorities. 
 
Q: But in your mind he was a suspect, or from what you knew from news 
reports, he was a suspect during that week before the 17th? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Other than knowing he had been questioned by the authorities, what else had 
you heard that would  cause you to think Mr. Simpson was a suspect that week? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. That misstates --  
 
MR. RE: I am going to ask him to invoke the  privilege at that point. 
 
MR. LEONARD: -- his testimony.   
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: When was the next time you spoke to --  Strike that question.  Did you speak 
to Cathy Randa at any time between June 13th and 17th? 
 
MR. RE: Same -- I am going to ask him to invoke the privilege.  You just have 
to say "Privilege." 
 
THE WITNESS: Privilege. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. And could you tell me the first time you spoke to Mr. Simpson after 
you had arrived  down at the Browns on June 13th,1994? 
 
MR. RE: I am going to ask him to assert the  privilege. 
 
THE WITNESS: Privilege. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. When was -- Did you speak to Bill Pavelick at any time between June 
13th and June 17th -- 
 
MR. RE: Same thing. 
 
BY MR. KELLY:   
 
Q: -- 1994? 
 
THE WITNESS: Privilege. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did you ever receive any money from  Skip Taft at any time after June 17th, 
1994? 
 
MR. RE: We are talking about after June 17th? 
 
MR. KELLY: 1994. 
 
MR. RE: Okay. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did you ever receive any money from  Robert Kardashian any time after 
June 17th, 1994? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever receive any money from Cathy Randa after June 17th, 1994? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever receive any money from anybody after June 17th, 1994 on 
behalf of  Mr. Simpson? 
 
MR. RE: I don't even understand what that  question means. What do you mean, 
"on behalf of  Mr. Simpson"? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did someone give you money on to you  on Mr. Simpson's behalf? 
 
A: When? 
 
MR. LEONARD: I am going to object to that as  being vague. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
  
Q: After June 17th, 1994. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague.  
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Going back to the meeting you had had with Robin Greer a couple weeks 
after the murders in June of 1994, you remember we discussed that last week? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you recall again where the location of that meeting was? 
 
A: It was in Brentwood, just east of 26th Street, right off of San Vicente.   
 
Q: Was that the Brentwood Country Mart? 
 
A: No. We -- I met her on the street. We -- I don't know if it was Bristol or 
Burlingame. It was one of the -- we just pulled to the curb. I just pulled to the 
side in front of a house, and we just talked. 
 
Q: Okay. You never met her inside the -- or out front in the seating area of the 
Brentwood Country Mart? 
 
MR. RE: Never? Or are you talking about that day? 
 
BY MR. KELLY:   
 
Q: That day. 
 
A: We could have met there. We could have eventually met there and then she 
got in the car -- we could have. I don't know. But we -- she was playing tennis 
that day or had a tennis lesson, and she was in  the area, so we met. 
 
Q: Now going back to the conversation you had with Robin Greer that day, did 
you ever in substance indicate to her that you had heard that Faye  Resnick had 
wanted to open a coffee shop and needed money and may have borrowed it 
from a drug cartel? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever hear anything like that in June of 1994? 
 
A: There were rumors going around. I don't know if it was Faye or Nicole and 
Faye were thinking about opening up a coffee shop or doing some type of  
business together. That was more or less hearsay, I guess. 
 
Q: What about the part that Faye had  borrowed money from a drug cartel to 
start a coffee  shop? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague. 
 
THE WITNESS: That I never heard.   
 
BY MR. KELLY:  
 
Q: You never heard that? 
 
A: I never heard it. 
 
Q: Who did you hear these rumors from about  Faye and Nicole wanting to open 
a coffee shop? 
 
A: I don't know if it was a coffee shop or some type of business. It was just -- I 
don't know, to be -- I don't know who said it. I remember hearing it. But like I 
say, it was secondhand stuff. It was like a lot of stuff that was flying around, so I 
l didn't give it too much thought. 
 
Q: Did you ever have any discussion with  Robin Greer about Nicole had been 
doing drug deals with Colombians? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever discuss with Robin Greer or  any of Nicole's friends that Nicole 
had been hanging around Colombians in restaurants or nightclubs at all? 
 
A: Not to my knowledge. 
 
Q: Did you ever indicate to anybody that you  had heard Nicole had been 
hanging around Colombians in  the Renaissance? 
 
A: Not to my knowledge. 
 
Q: Never heard any rumor like that even? 
 
A: Even to what? 
 
Q: That Nicole had been hanging around in  the Renaissance with Colombians. 
 
A: I heard that she would go to the Renaissance. It was a popular night spot. 
 
Q: And you never suggested to Robin Greer or  any other friend of Nicole's that 
Nicole had been hanging around with Colombians and doing drug deals with 
them shortly before her death? 
 
A: No. When I asked Robin, I wanted to know what type of people that they 
were hanging around or people were hanging around them, but I never 
specifically said they were drug dealers or she never  said they were drug 
dealers. 
 
Q: You never suggested she had been dealing with drug dealers, that Nicole had 
been dealing with  drug dealers? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You never suggested, ever, that Nicole had been hanging around chug 
dealers at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever suggest to any of Nicole's friends that she had been doing drug 
deals, at all, shortly before her death? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ask any of Nicole's friends -- when I say, "ask any of Nicole's 
friends," you testified last week as to these meetings you had with Cici and Cora 
and Robin and Christian Reichardt? 
 
A: I didn't have a meeting with Christian. 
 
Q: You spoke to him on the phone. 
 
A: I spoke to him on the phone. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you speak to any of these people about Nicole having any 
interaction with drug dealers shortly before her death? 
 
A: No. I was trying to find out who the players were, what type of people that 
they were hanging out with.   
 
Q: You weren't suggesting any people that  Nicole was hanging out with, at all? 
 
A: No. I just wanted to know who the  players were. 
 
Q: Did you ever hear at any time after  Nicole's murder that she had ever been 
associating with any drug dealers shortly before her murder? 
 
A: I would get letters in the mail, people would call my house, people I didn't 
know, and I would  get letters in the mail suggesting that they knew of  
something about Nicole and what she was doing, parties they would run into her 
at. You know, I just shoved  it off, just... 
 
Q: Did you ever find one bit of concrete information that suggested Nicole 
Brown Simpson was  associated with any drug dealers in the months before her 
murder? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague. 
 
THE WITNESS: Any time these people would call  me and talk to me, I said, 
"Well, what you know, are you willing to speak to the investigators?" 
 
And they say, "I don't want to get involved," so I just figured they were lying. 
 
MR. RE: Are you talking about -- when you are  talking about dealing with drug 
dealers, are you talking about dealing with drug dealers in drug deals, or are you 
talking about personal use of drugs? 
 
MR. KELLY:  Any of the above. 
 
Q: Did you ever get any concrete information  anywhere that Nicole was either 
buying drugs or even using drugs in the months before her death? 
 
MR. LEONARD: I am going to object as being  vague. 
 
THE WITNESS: The only concrete thing that  know pertaining to anything 
pertaining to drugs was Faye being... 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: In rehab? 
 
A: In rehab. 
 
Q: Other than Faye being in rehab, did you have any personal knowledge or 
even -- well, it will be called a compound question, so I'll break it down. 
 
THE WITNESS: I've got it talk to you about  that. Excuse us. 
 
MR. KELLY: Sure. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record  now, and the time is 
approximately 10:53. 
 
(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the hearing of  the 
reporter.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record  now, and the time is 
approximately 11:01. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Mr. Cowlings, excluding the period between June 13th and June 17th, did 
you ever receive or have any personal knowledge of Nicole ever using  drugs in 
the months prior to her death? 
 
MR. RE: Excluding the period from June 13th to June 17th. 
 
THE WITNESS: Excluding --  
 
MR. RE: Excluding that, not counting that period. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Excluding that time period, did you ever receive any information as to 
Nicole hanging  out with drug dealers or doing drug deals, at all, in  the couple 
months before her death? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the compound nature of  the question. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did you ever talk to any of Nicole's friends about a jealous boyfriend 
possibly murdering her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever receive any information as to a boyfriend or ex-boyfriend 
having possibly been involved in Nicole's murder? 
 
A: Are you still talking about this time frame? 
 
Q: Yeah, exclude the 13th through the 17th  of June. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you receive any information within  that time frame regarding a jealous 
boyfriend or ex-boyfriend who might have been involved in Nicole's  murder? 
 
MR. RE: Privilege. 
 
THE WITNESS: Privilege. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: In the weeks after June 17th, 1994 -- this is after Mr. Simpson has been 
incarcerated and you've been released -- you indicated you were out  trying to 
get a feel for what Nicole had been doing  the months before her death? 
 
A: I don't know if it was a feel for what  Nicole was doing. I just wanted to 
know who were the players or people that maybe had -- they had been  
socializing with. 
 
Q: Did you ever at any time after  June 17th, 1994 receive any information or 
any suggestion as to someone other than Mr. Simpson being  involved in 
Nicole's murder? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Compound. 
 
THE WITNESS: I'd gotten, like I say, phone  calls, letters making accusations 
about Ron Goldman.  There was one lady who called me a number of times  
claiming that she was at a party with Nicole. 
 
And so I said to her, I said, "Telling me doesn't do you any good. I'd be more 
than willing to  put you in touch with the investigators or you could get in touch 
with the authorities," and she never  would. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. You indicated you had spoken to Bill Pavelick on more than one 
occasion after  June 17th, '94, had you not? 
 
A: Yes, I did speak with the man. 
 
Q: And you spoke to at least one other  investigator who you at least were under 
the  impression was working with Bob -- Bill Pavelick also, did you not? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you spoke to Bob Shapiro on more than  one occasion? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you had been speaking to Mr. Simpson while he was incarcerated?  
 
A: Not that often. 
 
Q: But you did? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you spoke to Skip Taft? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
 Q: And as far as you knew, these people were  dealing with Mr. Simpson 
regularly also, were they  not? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever receive any information yourself from any of these 
people as to  who could possibly, possibly, be responsible for Nicole's murder 
other than Mr. Simpson? 
 
MR. RE: Can I just clarify? Are you talking about directly from him as opposed 
to news reports to  what they said? Because we could get through all  the --  
 
MR. KELLY: I am not talking about news  reports. I am talking about the 
people he had  conversations with. 
 
MR. RE: No, no. For example, if they went on  the news and they said 
something, do you want him to  relate what he heard them saying on the news 
about --  
 
MR. KELLY: Sure, anything. 
 
MR. RE: My God, we could... 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: In your own mind as you sit here today,  do you have any formulation of any 
possible suspect other than Mr. Simpson in the murder of Nicole? 
 
A: Do I have my suspicions or my suspect?  If I'd have known something, I 
probably would have  came forward a long time ago. I don't know anything. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever know anybody who was murdered by a Colombian? 
 
A: Not that I know of. 
 
Q: Do you know anybody who had been  threatened or assaulted for owing 
money on personal-use amounts of cocaine? 
 
A: Have I -- do I? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: The first day of your testimony, you indicated you had a gut feeling that 
Simpson didn't  kill Nicole. Remember stating that? 
 
A: If that's in -- if it's there, yes, I've said it. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you still have that gut feeling that Mr. Simpson didn't kill Nicole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. RE: I just want to make sure, because you slurred it. You said did not. 
Correct? 
 
MR. KELLY: Did not. 
 
THE WITNESS: Did not commit the murders. 
 
BY MR. KELLY:   
 
Q: Right. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You have that gut feeling as you sit here  today? 
 
A: Right, uh-huh. 
 
Q: Did Simpson ever tell you that he did not kill Nicole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When was that? 
 
MR. RE: Well, we will exclude the period? 
 
MR. KELLY: I haven't excluded anything yet. 
 
MR. RE: Okay. Well, then --  
 
THE WITNESS: Privilege. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did Mr. Simpson ever tell you after June 17th, 1994 that he did not kill 
Nicole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When was that? 
 
A: I don't know when, but I remember him telling me. 
 
Q: Do you know what month it was?   
 
A: No, I don't know if -- it could have been the times that I would go down to 
visit him. I couldn't tell you, but I remember him telling me. I couldn't tell you 
where or, you know, what time or what month. 
 
Q: Did you -- was that as a result of you asking him whether he killed Nicole? 
 
A: I never asked O.J., did he kill Nicole. 
 
Q: He just offered that he did not kill Nicole during the course of a 
conversation? 
 
A: During the course of the conversation.

Magli footprints were left at Bundy the night of June 12th, 1994?

A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever discuss any of the  evidence against Mr. Simpson with 
him in any of your  discussions with him? 
 
MR. RE: Excluding the period? 
 
MR. KELLY: Excluding that period. 
 
THE WITNESS: When I would go to visit, he would talk about the events that 
happened in the trial. I never questioned him on things. He would  more or less 
talk about what happened or... 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: By the way, did he ever tell you what  was he doing between 9:00 o'clock 
and 10:30 on June 12th, 1994? 
 
MR. RE: Excluding the period? 
 
MR. KELLY: Excluding the period. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I am going to object. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Not that I remember. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did you ever ask Mr. Simpson what he was doing between 9:00 and 10:30 
p.m. on June 12th, 1994? 
 
MR. RE: Excluding the period?

Q: Did you ever discuss with Mr. Simpson  what he was doing between 9:00 
o'clock and  11:00 o'clock on June 12th, 1994?

BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did you ever -- did you ever ask Simpson what he was doing between 9:00 
o'clock and 11:00 o'clock p.m. on June 12th, 1994? 
 
MR. RE: Excluding the period? 
 
MR. KELLY: For now excluding the period. 
 
THE WITNESS: Probably with him talking, not me  asking, he probably told 
me. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: What do you think he told you? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection to what he thinks. Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: What do you recall him telling you? 
 
MR. RE: Again, you are talking about personal  conversations as opposed to, for 
example, listening to l his video that came out or something like that? 
 
MR. KELLY: I am talking about conversations he  had with Mr. Simpson. 
 
THE WITNESS: Basically when O.J. talks, he just talks, you know. You just 
listen. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: What did you listen to him talking about hen he would talk about the night of 
June 12th, 1994? 
 
A: I don't remember in details.   
 
Q: In general? 
 
A: I couldn't answer that because I really don't remember exactly what he was 
telling me, you  know, what he had did or what it was he was doing. 
 
Q: Do you recall him telling you he had left  the house at all between 9:00 and 
11:00 p.m. that  night of June 12th, 1 994? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: You recall nothing of the conversation  you had with Mr. Simpson regarding 
what he had done  the evening of June 12th, 1994 between 9:00 and  11:00 
p.m.? 
 
A: No. I would just be speculating if  I did. 
 
Q: No recollection? 
 
A: No recollection me personally. 
 
Q: Any other way other than you personally? 
 
A: Just, you know, the stuff that I've heard, you know, through telecasts or 
through his  interview or things that Kato said what they did, but  I don't 
remember him telling me. 
 
Q: This is your closest friend as you sit here today, Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: And he was accused of murdering one of  your other closest friends, his ex-
wife, Nicole Brown  Simpson, on the night of June 12th, 1994. Correct? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did you ever ask Mr. Simpson what he was  doing that night at the 
approximate time his ex-wife and one of your closest friends, Nicole Brown  
Simpson --   
 
A: You talking about the same two people.  You said "ex-wife" and close -- 
 
Q: That's right. That's right. 
 
A: I'm sorry. Go ahead. 
 
Q: Did you ever ask him what he was doing at the approximate time Nicole was 
murdered? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: Like I just stated, he may have told me, but I don't know what 
he had said to me. I know what has been said by hisself through his interviews 
or through what Kato has said. I couldn't  tell you if, you know -- am I making 
myself clear? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Not to me. I am asking you: What do you  remember --  
 
A: I don't remember -- 
 
Q: -- yourself your best friend telling you about what he was doing the night that 
his ex-wife was  murdered? I would think of that as a rather significant question 
and answer in your mind,  Mr. Cowlings. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative. 
 
MR. RE: Is that last part part of the question? 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember. 
 
MR. KELLY: No. It's a statement after the  question. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember. 
 
MR. KELLY: Trying to get an answer. 
 
MR. RE: You got an answer. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: You don't remember? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: What did Katherine Allen, Marcus' wife, call you for a couple months ago? 
You indicated she had called you for information. 
 
A: I didn't say she called me for  information. She probably called me to say, 
you know, say hi. We're still friends. 
 
Q: She didn't call you for any information? 
 
A: No. Just, "How you doing?" She needed to find out something -- information 
on something  else. It had nothing to do with this case or anybody  in this case. 
 
Q: Okay. By the way, did Marcus Allen ever deny he was having an affair with 
Nicole when you told  him you knew about it? 
 
A: Marcus didn't say. 
 
Q: Did he ever deny he was having an affair  with Nicole when you confronted 
him with it? 
 
A: He never said. He just sloughed -- I mean, he just... He was sad, bothered, but 
he never  said one way or another, and I wasn't looking for an answer. 
 
Q: Did he ever deny he was having an affair  with Nicole when you confronted 
him with it? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Asked and answered. 
 
MR. KELLY: It's not answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: He never said anything. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know yourself when was the  last time Marcus Allen saw

Q: Was she there at any time that day?

A: I don't know. How long has Marcus been  married? Three -- three years, four 
years? I don't l know. I don't know exactly. 
 
MR. RE: Dan probably knows it.   
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I do know. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: At the time of Marcus' wedding, were Nicole and O.J. back together?  
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Okay. By the way, we have been talking  about your conversations you had 
with some of Nicole's friends after June 17th, 1994, when you talked to Cora  
and Cici and Robin and some other people.  Did you yourself ever find out what  
Nicole had been doing the night of June 11th, 1994?

Q: Ever find out who she was with? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Would you be able to tell me where Marcus  Allen was the day of June 
11th,1994? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.  Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: June 11th would have been what day?

A: I was with him June 12th, early afternoon. 
 
Q: With Marcus? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where were you with him with -- at? 
 
A: We -- he called me. We went -- he was  thinking about buying a Hummer, one 
of those big four-wheel vehicles -- 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: -- and we drove out --  
 
Q: Where did he call you from? Do you know? 
 
A: I guess from his house. I don't remember  exactly. But he called, and I went 
and picked him up  and we drove out to Thousand Oaks. 
 
Q: What time of day was this that he called  you? 
 
A: I don't know. It could have been in the  morning, late morning. We went out 
there in the afternoon. 
 
Q: And do you recall approximately what time you got back? 
 
A: Late afternoon. I had -- he had invited me for dinner with him and Katherine, 
and I was going  to -- with that in hopes of me taking him and  Katherine to the 
airport, but I had somewhere else to be Sunday night, so I wouldn't have been 
able to take them to the airport. 
 
Q: Okay. He was going out of town Sunday night with his wife? 
 
A: Yes. They were going on some type of  vacation or some --  
 
Q: Did -- 
 
A: I don't know if it was a sports -- sports type of celebrity thing. Something. 
 
Q: Had Marcus told you what he had been  doing the day before when you were 
with him that day? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. On that day did Marcus ever discuss Nicole with you at all?

BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: On the 12th when you were with him.

Q: Okay. Did you ever find out that -- on June 11th, that Saturday night, the 
night before  Nicole's murder, that Sydney, her daughter, had spent the night at 
Schwartz's house? 
 
A: I've heard since then that Sydney had  spent the night there. 
 
Q: Did you ever find out where Nicole was that night, the night of June 
11th,1994? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: No knowledge whatsoever? 
 
A: No knowledge. 
 
Q: By the way, at Rockingham, you are familiar with the security system there? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Let me just pose a --  
 
MR. KELLY: Sure. 
 
MR. LEONARD: At what time? 
 
MR. KELLY: We will say in June of '94. 
 
MR. LEONARD: June of '94. Okay. And I am objecting as vague as what you 
mean by "security system." 
 
MR. KELLY: I'll go into it a little bit.  
 
MR. LEONARD: Okay. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did you know how the alarm was set at Rockingham in June of 1994, how to

BY MR. KELLY:   
 
Q: Did you speak to him at all? 
 
A: Him and I would, you know, when I would  go by there, if he happened to be 
there, we would just speak small talk. I didn't know Kato that well. 
 
Q: Did Simpson tell you he ever spent any time with Kato? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Not that I remember. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did Simpson ever tell you Kato was a  close friend of his? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Not that I remember.   
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Do you know whether or not Kato had the code to the security system in 
June of 1994? 
 
A: Not that I know of. 
 
Q: Was Simpson rather cautious in who he would give the alarm code to in June 
of -- or at any time that you knew him? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation. Lack of foundation.  Vague. 
 
THE WITNESS: Not that I know of. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Well, was Mr. Simpson careful about putting on the alarm when he was 
going to be leaving the house vacant for any period of time? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation, calls for speculation, and it's 
vague. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, if he wasn't there, if nobody was there, if the maid and 
everybody was gone, he'd always put the alarm on. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Would it strike you as out of character for Mr. Simpson to give Kato Kaelin 
the code to his alarm system?   
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection --  
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know.   
 
MR. LEONARD: -- calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know.   
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know if Westec Security could be summoned directly from 
that security system in the Rockingham house? 
 
A: If -- it's been times in the past where I may have tripped the alarm, and 
Westec I think would  call first and then a patrol car would come out -- 
 
Q: Do you know --  
 
A: -- or vice versa, one or the other, but they will respond. 
 
Q: You had been there on occasions when Westec Security had been out to the 
Rockingham house? 
 
A: Yeah. If I had to go by to check on the house and hit the code wrong or 
maybe got up one  morning not knowing that I had the alarm on and opened the 
door, and it goes off. 
 
Q: Do you know whether there was a panic  button on that system where you 
could just hit a  button on the keypad and a Westec Security person would come 
to Rockingham? 
 
MR. LEONARD: At what point in time? 
 
MR. KELLY: At any time, first of all. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Were you ever present there when Westec Security was --  arrived 
there with Nicole and  Simpson there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Did Mr. Simpson ever tell you about a time he broke the windshield of 
a car that Nicole was sitting in at Rockingham? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Nicole ever tell you about a time or an incident where Mr. Simpson had 
shattered the windshield of a car she was sitting in when she was  parked in the 
driveway at Rockingham? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever hear anything about that incident I've just mentioned? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Supposedly, I guess, in the media came -- said something about 
it. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Going back to the San Francisco 1979 incident we discussed before 
with the clothes being chucked out the window? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You described that as when you were sleeping at Simpson's condo that night 
and Nicole was  there also. Do you remember that? 
 
A: We all eventually went to bed. 
 
Q: You were out in the living room, though, at one point? 
 
A: Yeah, after -- I stayed out a little longer after the two of them retired. 
 
Q: But the first time they retired, you were out in the living room, and Nicole 
and Simpson were in the bedroom with the door closed. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And at that time Nicole came out of the bedroom and was upset? 
 
A: Seemed to be, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Had Simpson hit her prior to her coming out of the room? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Not that I know of. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. But Nicole was upset or appeared  to be upset to you when she came 
out of the room? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: I could see that she was bothered by something. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: She was upset. 
 
A: She was bothered. 
 
Q: Do you recall testifying before that she was upset? 
 
A: She was upset, bothered. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you see any bruises on her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Scratches on her?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Black eyes?   
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Nicole tell you what had happened to upset her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was it true Nicole didn't even want to talk about it? 
 
A: I asked her --  
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: I asked her, and she just shook  her head. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Didn't say anything.   
 
A: No 
 
Q: And in fact on New Year's morning, 1989,  when you first arrived at 
Rockingham in the early morning hours, Nicole was upset then also, wasn't she? 
 
A: She was mad. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: She was mad.  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Was she upset also? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: She was upset, but she was probably more mad than upset. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Did you see any bruises on her  then? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. You went into this in detail, Mr. Kelly, I think 
more than once. 
 
THE WITNESS: Like I said, I saw her face red.   Looked like she had been 
flustered or like when she was mad. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. But at that time she didn't tell you what happened to her either, did 
she? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. No, she didn't. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: And she didn't want to talk about it? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: After I asked her a few questions, she said, "A.C., I want to be 
left alone." 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. And after the '79 incident Simpson never told you what happened in 
the bedroom that night, did he, himself? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I think O.J. told me that it started -- the argument started 
because she accused him of buying a gift or something. I don't know exactly 
what. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: This is in '79? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. And after the New Year's Day incident of '89, did Simpson ever tell 
you what had  happened early that morning? 
 
A: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.   
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: '79, disregard that. I mean, I was talking about '89. '89 was where he said that 
she had  accused him of buying something for a girlfriend or  buying something. 
 
Q: Other than that, did he tell you anything else had happened physically 
between them in those early morning hours before you got there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And in '79 when you asked him after the fact what had happened in the 
bedroom between he and Nicole before he threw the clothes out the window, did 
he tell you anything that had happened? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. That --  
 
THE WITNESS: I don't --  
 
MR. LEONARD: First of all, it's leading, and it mischaracterizes his earlier 
testimony. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember ever asking him what happened. Like I said, 
they retired that  evening. When we all woke up the next morning, things  
seemed like they were back to normal. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall where Simpson would usually park his car outside his 
gates at Rockingham? 
 
A: What car?   
 
Q: Bronco. 
 
MR. LEONARD: At what time period? 
 
MR. KELLY: Well, whenever he had the Bronco. 
 
Q: Do you recall what street you would  usually see it parked on, if any? 
 
A: Sometimes it'd be parked on the street.  Sometimes it'd be parked inside. 
 
Q: Was there any particular street he would park it on? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: No specific street. Wherever he felt comfortable in parking his 
car. As long as there was -- if it was on Rockingham or if it was on Ashford. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: And it's your testimony he used to park it on both those streets? 
 
A: At times, yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. By the way, how tall are you, Mr. Cowlings? 
 
A: 6-5. 
 
Q: And how much do you weigh?   
 
A: About 255, 260. 
 
Q: And how tall is Simpson?   
 
A: About 6-1, 6-1-1/2. 
 
Q: Do you know what he weighs? 
 
A: In the 200 pound range, somewhere around  there. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know how tall Nicole was? 
 
A: Nicole could have been about 5-7, 5-8. 
 
Q: Do you know approximately what she weighed? 
 
A: No. 120,125. 
 
Q: Okay. And you had indicated earlier that  you loved Nicole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Felt very protective of her?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. You'd pretty much do anything for her? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And Nicole told you on New Year's  Day, 1989 that Simpson had 
pulled her hair and hit  her? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: No, she didn't tell me that. She didn't tell me about him pulling 
her hair. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: She never told you on New Year's Day, 1989 that Simpson had pulled her 
hair? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Never told you that. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. She told you that Simpson hit her,  didn't she? 
 
A: She said she was hit. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Asked and answered. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did she tell you Simpson hit her? 
 
A: She told me she was hit. 
 
Q: By Mr. Simpson? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative. Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: She didn't say -- she just said,  "I was hit." 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Mr. Cowlings, New Year's morning Nicole had been hit, according to 
her when you got  there. Correct? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did you believe her when she told you she had been hit? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Were you so upset about the fact that she had been hit and her head was 
hurting that you skipped the Rose Bowl that day? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Asked and answered. Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: I skipped the Rose Bowl because I  was concerned, and let her 
know that if she needed me, I was there for her. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: And you were worried about her head hurting and feared she might even 
have a concussion? 
 
A: When I went back that evening and she still said her head was hurting, I said, 
you know, "We  should have it checked. You may have a concussion. " 
 
Q: And you took her to the hospital? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you ever say anything to Mr. Simpson  after that day about what had 
happened between him and Nicole? 
 
A: I could have. Could have asked him, you  know, what happened. 
 
Q: Did you ever say anything to him about,  "Why did you do that to Nicole?  
 
A: I probably could have -- I probably said,  "What happened?" 
 
Q: Did you ever tell him not to do it again? 
 
A: Not that I remember. 
 
Q: Did you ever tell him, if he ever laid a hand on Nicole again, you'd kill him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Nothing like that?   
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Nothing to the defense of Nicole after that warning? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. RE: I am sorry. What was that last -- I didn't understand what you just said. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Yeah, I didn't hear the question. 
 
MR. RE: Nothing to what? 
 
MR. KELLY: You can read it back. 
 
(Record read as follows: 
 
"Q. Nothing to the defense of Nicole after that warning? 
 
A. No. ) 
 
MR. LEONARD: I am going to object as argumentative. 
 
MR. RE: I don't even understand what that means. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't either.   
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: You answered it, didn't you? 
 
A: Well, I was on a roll. 
 
Q: Yeah, say "no," huh? Didn't matter what the question was? 
 
A: No. I justyou ran them close together. 
 
Q: And you gave the same answer, "no," matter what the question was? 
 
A: I probably won't make that mistake again. 
 
Q: Okay. I am going to ask you if you -- You can mark this. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Can I make a suggestion? 
 
MR. KELLY: Yeah. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: John, we can mark a xerox of  that for the record, and we 
can hold onto the original  to that photograph. We have done it with the others. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I will get copies made. 
 
(plaintiffs' exhibit 178 was marked for identification by the reporter  and is 
attached hereto.) 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Do you recognize that picture, Mr. Cowlings? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you recognize everybody in that photo also? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Could you tell me who is in there?   
 
A: Lou Brown, Nicole, O.J., Sydney, Arnelle, Judy, Minnie, Jason, myself, and 
I think that's Tanya between... It looks like Tanya between Jason and  Minnie. 
 
Q: And do you know -- you're in there also. Right? 
 
A: Yeah, I said me. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know when that picture was taken? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Did you say when? 
 
MR. KELLY: When and where. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember where. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Do you recognize that as Hawaii at Christmastime 1988 when you went 
there? 
 
A: I don't know for sure, to be honest with you. 
 
Q: Do you know of any other vacation you took with the Browns where that 
might have been taken? 
 
MR. LEONARD: I am just going to object. That  assumes that that's a 
photograph taken on a vacation  with the Browns. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
MR. LEONARD: But other than that, it's a great question. 
 
MR. KELLY: Thanks. Was it the best of the day? 
 
THE WITNESS: I really couldn't tell you, sir. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. No recollection of when that  picture was taken. 
 
A: Uh-uh, no. 
 
Q: Okay. You had testified earlier that  Simpson had told you about an incident 
at his house with Denise, Nicole and Ed McCabe? Do you recall that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And Simpson had told you something had happened?  
 
A: An argument started between -- discussion started between him and Denise.  
 
Q: Did he tell why it started? 
 
MR. LEONARD: I am just going to object. This has been gone into in detail. 
 
MR. KEI LY: Well, I will change the question. 
 
Q: Did you ever discuss this same incident  with Denise Brown? 
 
A: Not that I remember. 
 
Q: Did you ever discuss it with Nicole? 
 
A: Not that I remember. 
 
Q: Did you ever discuss it with Ed McCabe? 
 
A: Not that I remember. 
 
Q: Was it your understanding this incident  had occurred because Nicole was 
not allowed to smoke inside the house? 
 
A: It was not that she was not allowed.  O.J. just didn't allow smoking in his 
house, and Nicole smoked, and when she would smoke, she would always go 
outside to smoke. 
 
Q: So it' was your understanding that Nicole,  who lived in that house at 
Rockingham, was not allowed  to smoke in that house? 
 
A: No one was allowed to smoke in that house. 
 
Q: But there was only one person who lived there other than Simpson. That was 
his wife, Nicole.  Correct? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: People who would come by and  smoked, and if the urge came 
upon them, they would -- O.J. would -- they asked, and O.J. said, "Well, I prefer 
if you, you know, would go outside to smoke  because I don't allow smoking in 
the house." 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. These other people didn't live in that house, did they? 
 
A: No. He did that on hopes of Nicole  quitting smoking. 
 
Q: Okay. By the way, Marquerite, Jason and Arnelle lived at Rockingham with 
Simpson before the divorce, did they not? 
 
A: As far as I know, yes. 
 
Q: And after the divorce Marquerite, Arnelle and Jason moved out of 
Rockingham and Simpson stayed? 
 
A: No. I think they continued to live there. 
 
Q: But after the divorce. 
 
A: After the divorce they lived there.  
 
Q: Marquerite, Arnelle and Jason? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: For how long? 
 
A: I think for a year. I think whatever the  divorce procedures outlined, I think 
she stayed at the house. That was part of the agreement, I think. 
 
Q: But after a certain period of time --  
 
A: A certain --  
 
Q: -- she and the kids had to move out? 
 
A: Yes, eventually, yes. 
 
Q: And Simpson kept the house. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And likewise, when Simpson divorced  Nicole, is it your understanding that 
Nicole, Jason and Sydney left the house also? 
 
A: Whatever his agreement was. I think O.J. had to buy Marquerite out of her 
portion or whatever  the settlement called for. When Nicole moved, she  moved 
to Gretna Green and the kids went with her. 
 
Q: So Simpson had two wives and four children move out of Rockingham, but 
to this day he  still owns Rockingham himself. Is that correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: You saw Nicole the last couple months before her murder, didn't you? 
 
A: I didn't see Nicole that much when she moved to Bundy. I had only been to 
her place maybe -- maybe three times at the most. I would see her -- Nicole 
would jog in the morning, her and Cora, so I would see her as I was either 
leaving my apartment or coming back to my apartment. 
 
Q: Would she jog every morning, by the way? 
 
A: She jogged an awful lot. 
 
Q: Even in the last couple months before her  murder, did you see her jogging 
often? 
 
A: I don't remember, but I remember seeing  Nicole jog a lot. She was, you 
know... 
 
Q: Healthy? 
 
A: Healthy. 
 
Q: Would it be fair to say she was a fitness  nut? 
 
A: I don't know about a fitness nut, but she was -- Nicole had a nice shape. She 
took pride in her appearance. 
 
Q: Was she careful about the food she ate even, her diet? 
 
A: I guess. I mean, I didn't -- we never  had a discussion on what she was eating. 
I remember I introduced her to her nutritionist, a gentleman -- a Dr. Antoine. 
 
Q: When was that? 
 
A: Years ago. Years ago. Because I had  been going to him, and I was very 
successful in what I was trying to achieve as far as losing weight and all  that, 
and so she wanted to meet with him. 
 
Q: But you did see Nicole in the last couple  months before her murder. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: I can't -- I couldn't answer that question because I really don't 
know. I mean, I would I see her --  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Let me say, did you see her at Mother's Day down at the Browns in May of 
1994? 
 
A: Yes. That I did, yes, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you happen to see her at all on her birthday? 
 
A: I don't think so. 
 
Q: Did you speak to her on her birthday? 
 
A: I probably did, called her, wished her a happy birthday. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you know she had been sick  around that time also? 
 
A: I remember O.J. telling me that she had --  
 
Q: Pneumonia? 
 
A: -- pneumonia or the flu, and he was going  by to see after her. 
 
I went by one night. I had called O.J.'s  house, and he wasn't in. I think -- I don't 
know if  it was Michelle, if she was there or she said, "He's over at Nicole's." So 
I called there; he was there, so I went by and saw him and Nicole and the kids. 
 
Q: Okay. In these times that you spoke to  her or saw Nicole the last couple 
months before her  death, did you see any signs of depression in her?   
 
A: No. I saw Nicole one morning. I was  coming back from working out, and it 
was the week -- or the day -- no -- it was the morning that she was going to Cabo 
with O.J.  
 
Q: That was in April, wasn't it? 
 
A: If that's -- if that's when they went.  And she had rear-ended another car, an 
accident, fender bender. So as I walked -- I walked, and I said, "Nic," and she 
said, "Oh, you see," she says, "oh, I'm in a rush," blah, blah, blah. "O.J.'s  
waiting for me. We're going to Cabo."  
 
She seemed to be very happy about that:, and her and the lady were exchanging 
insurance and  license information because -- whatever time the flight was 
leaving late that morning to Cabo. 
 
Q: Was this a weekday morning, as you  recall it? 
 
A: It could have been. 
 
Q: Do you know what car that was that she had been driving? 
 
A: It was her black jeep. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever hear of any other  accident Nicole had been involved in 
in the last year or two before her murder? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Not personal knowledge. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Did she ever tell you about any? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Going back to the last couple months before Nicole's murder, you 
didn't see any  signs of depression yourself, did you? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. One time I stopped by O.J.'s, and Nicole and him were 
there. They seemed to  be very happy, and they were at that time making plans  
of her moving back. 
 
I remember she was mad. She was mad at  Kato. So while I was there, she 
picked up the phone -- no. He wasn't in. Kato wasn't there, he wasn't at home 
there at O.J.'s, and she said "He gotta get his freeloading ass out of here," or  
something like that, and she picked up the phone and  called his machine and 
laid it in on him. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Were you there when she did that? 
 
A: Yes, I was. 
 
Q: Do you recall exactly what she said? 
  
A: She had choice words. Like I said, she wanted him to get his ass out of there. 
 
Q: Out of Rockingham?   
 
A: Out of Rockingham.  
 
MR. RE: I think you have a phone call to make, don't you?   
 
MR. KELLY: Sound bite.   
 
Q: Just very briefly, Mr. Cowlings, did you  see any signs of depression or a 
change in her mood the last couple months in the times you saw her? Yes --  
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection    
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: -- or no. 
 
A: Not --  
 
MR. LEONARD: Let me get my objection in. 
 
THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Calls for speculation. Lack of  foundation.  
 
THE WITNESS: No.  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Did you see any signs of drug use in Nicole in the last couple months 
when you saw her? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Same objection.  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did you see any signs of her drinking or  abusing alcohol the last couple 
months you saw her? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Same objection.   
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Did you see any signs that she had  transformed into an aggressive, 
promiscuous woman in  the last couple months of '94 before her murder? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Same objection, plus vague. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Any signs of any of these things  in the last couple months before 
Nicole's murder? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Same objections. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay, let's take a brief break here. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: This is the --  
 
THE WITNESS: Making a phone call already?

EXAMINATION (Resumed) 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Mr. Cowlings, going back to the morning  of New Year's Day, 1989, okay, 
and the first time you had arrived at Rockingham after the call to Michelle,  you 
indicated that you at one point saw Simpson leave  the kitchen? 
 
MR. LEONARD: I am just going to object because  it mischaracterizes the 
testimony. You said, "the call to Michelle." You meant --  
 
MR. KELLY: From Michelle. I am sorry. 
 
Q: You had gotten a call from Michelle, you  came over to Rockingham, you 
were in the kitchen talking to Nicole, and Mr. Simpson had walked in the  
kitchen at one point. Is that correct? 
 
A: What had happened, while Nicole and I was talking, when I was just standing 
there, I heard some  noise, like just some faint noise, and I walked  towards 
where I heard the noise, and it was from the  kitchen to the dining room. Just as 
I got close to  that door, O.J. was standing there. 
 
Q: And after he was standing there, what, if  anything, did he do? 
 
MR. LEONARD: I am going to object because this  has been asked and 
answered. It was went -- it was gone into in detail. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: You can answer. 
 
A: He wanted to talk to Nicole, and Nicole  didn't want to hear what he wanted 
to talk about. 
 
Q: And then what did Simpson do? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Same objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: She made a motion or she picked , up the phone to dial 911. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: And what did Simpson do then? 
 
A: Something about she going to call the  police again, and he turned around 
and disappeared  back into the darkness. 
 
Q: Did he head toward the back end of the house at that point? 
 
A: Seemed to me, yes. That's -- I didn't  notice him going out -- going around and 
coming out  the front door. I think he went out the back. 
 
Q: Okay. And that was the last time you saw  him before he called you from 
Schwartz's house? 
 
A: I don't know if he called me or Alan  called me. When I saw him later on that 
morning at  Alan's house -- that's the last time I saw him. 
 
Q: But what I am asking you is: The next I time you saw him after you saw him 
leaving toward the back of the house that morning, wasn't it your testimony that 
he then called you from Schwartz's an  hour or two later? 
 
A: I don't know if he called me or Alan  called me, but I did go to Alan's house, 
and that's  where he was. 
 
Q: Okay. When you got there after the call from either Simpson or Schwartz 
that morning, can you tell me exactly what Simpson said to you when you got  
there that morning? 
 
MR. LEONARD: I am going to object. This was  asked at least once before. 
This has been asked and  answered. 
 
MR. KELLY: I will allow you to have a standing objection to every question I 
am going to ask now about New Year's morning of '89. 
 
MR. RE: That doesn't bode well for where we're  going into, I guess. 
 
MR. KELLY: There's not going to be many. 
 
THE WITNESS: He just babbled. He just talked. O.J. has a tendency when he 
talks, he just  goes on and on and on and on. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Can you tell me specifically what he told you about Alan Schwartz's key and 
the bag of jewelry? 
 
A: I think that came later on while I was  there, that I think Alan knew -- I think 
Alan. was the one that told me that O.J. had lost the keys to his car, 'cause O.J. 
had gotten there by his own car but switched cars. He put his car in Alan's 
garage, and then he used Alan's car to -- I guess to go back up to the house later 
on -- early that morning. So I was asked to see if I could locate the keys and to 
get the  jewelry out of the garbage can. 
 
Q: Okay. What exactly did Simpson tell you  about the keys and the jewelry and 
the garbage can?  What instructions did he give you or directions did he give 
you? 
 
A: The directions he gave me was the location of the jewelry, he knew for a 
fact. The  keys, he just gave me his -- the --  
 
MR. RE: Route? 
 
THE WITNESS: -- the route that he took getting  back. The keys had to be 
somewhere along that  route to get back to the car. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. I want to take those two things separately. First of all, can you tell me 
the exact, route you were given by Simpson in terms of where to locate the 
keys? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Again, I am ,going to object. This was -- you had a diagram 
out. You had him go through it. I think you spent at least a half hour doing this. 
I don't know why we are going through this again, and I am going to object. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: You may answer. 
 
A: I just followed the path that when he left the house earlier that morning, how 
he went back to where he had parked Alan's car. 
 
Q: What did he tell you he had done after he parked Alan's car? 
 
A: I guess he -- I started from outside of the door of the back of his house and 
just followed  the path similar to what he had told me: Across his  tennis court, 
through the gate, through the Van  Wattses' property to the fence and that's 
where I found the keys. 
 
Q: Okay. And had he told you he had gone over the fence at Ashford to get to 
the car again? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Same objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, that's where I found them.  I looked around -- like I say, 
when I jumped when I grabbed and I looked over to where he thought that he 
had jumped over the fence, I looked around in there, and the keys were wedged 
between the grass and the  wall. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did he tell you how he had gotten onto  the property after he had parked 
Alan Schwartz's car? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he tell you whether or not he had  jumped over the wall on Ashford to 
get onto the Van Wattses' property and then get into his property initially? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know whether he did or not? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Lack of foundation --  
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
MR. LEONARD: -- calling for speculation. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Now, going to the jewelry bag, can  you describe exactly where that 
was -- where you retrieved it from? 
 
A: It was a house that was on Bristol.  Could have been one -- it could have been 
two or three  houses up from the corner of Ashford and Bristol on  the west side 
of the street. It was -- I walked down  the driveway and turned to my right, and 
there was a  group of garbage cans. 
 
Q: Is -- would you be able to, if I gave you a sheet of paper, be able to diagram 
the location of  the house and driveway relative to the street corners? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Could you give it a try for me, please? 
 
A: I'll try.  
 
Q: Okay.   
 
MR. LEONARD: I am going to object to him  trying. I think he is now 
speculating. 
 
MR. KELLY: He is not speculating. He's  trying. 
 
Q: Would a map or anything help or -- 
 
A: If you got a map, it'd probably be better. 
 
Q: All I have is --  
 
A: That's the same one we used last time. 
 
Q: Yeah, that's all I've got. 
 
A: All right. It would have been --  
 
Q: Before we mark these, would a photograph like this --  
 
A: Let me see. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You can't tell from those photographs. 
 
MR. KELLY: Let's see if it helps at all in terms of -- 
 
MR. LEONARD: What's the question? 
 
MR. KELLY: The question is: Why are you  standing up back there?  No there 
isn't a question. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I would like to see the photos. 
 
THE WITNESS: No, I can't tell. 
 
MR. KELLY: Help yourself. 
 
THE WITNESS: I can't tell from these. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: If you could just diagram Ashford and  Bristol and just generally indicate 
where Schwartz's  car was and the house with the garbage cans, where the  
jewelry bag was. 
 
MR. RE: You want him to do it on here  (Indicating)? 
 
THE WITNESS: Ashford -- well, you don't have  this street out here 
(Indicating), Bristol. Ashford crosses Bristol. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: As -- has a wall here (Indicating). I went over, found the keys. Like I said, I 
think Alan's car was parked on Bristol or parked on Ashford. 
 
Q: So as you faced -- 
 
A: It's right by -- there's a white house right here on the corner (Indicating). It's a 
big white wall runs right here, (Indicating), and the car was either parked there 
or parked around. I don't know for sure (Indicating). Go ahead. 
 
Q: If I might this would be Bristol here (Indicating)? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And this would be --  
 
A: The Van [sic] Watts. 
 
Q:  Ashford here (Indicating)? 
 
A: Yes, it would be Ashford here (Indicating). This is Bristol (Indicating). 
 
MR. KELLY: Is it all right if I label it? Do you have any objection to that, Mr. 
Re? 
 
THE WITNESS: Go ahead. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Ashford.  And you think this was Schwartz's car  right here (Indicating)? 
 
A: Either it was here (Indicating) or it was  around the corner (Indicating). 
 
Q: On Bristol.   
 
A: On Bristol.   
 
Q: Could you just mark for me where you think it was, approximately? 
 
MR. RE: Is this supposed to be to scale? 
 
MR. KELLY: No. 
 
MR. RE: Because at this rate the Van whatever  property is about an inch wide. 
 
MR. KELLY: Well, for lack of a better word --  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Pretty small house. Van Watts -- excuse me. Von Watts. 
 
MR. KELLY: Von Watts. 
 
THE WITNESS: Von Watts. I'm sorry. Von  Watts. 
 
MR. LEONARD: My objection is you're asking him  to speculate.  Go ahead. 
 
BY MR. KELLY:   
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: Like I said, it could have been the  second house or it could have been the 
third house. 
 
Q: If you made a left    
 
A: If you made a left   
 
Q:  on Bristol  
 
A:  heading north -- 
 
Q: Okay 
 
A: -- it would have been the house  it would have been on the west side of the 
street. 
 
It could have been the second or the third house. 
 
Q: When you say "The west side," would that be the left side of the street  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  as you faced up Bristol?  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: So we are clear now, Schwartz's car was parked on Ashford facing west on 
the left-hand side of  the street? 
 
A: It could have been parked -- 
 
Q: Or if you had made a left, it was on the left-hand side right around the corner 
on Bristol? 
 
A: It was -- it had to be somewhere in here (Indicating), either --  
 
Q: Okay. 
 
Q:  facing  it was facing south on  Bristol or it was parked on Ashford 
facing west. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, if you -- now, could you tell me, as you made a left on Bristol, 
how you got to the jewelry bag in the garbage can? 
 
A: I walked. 
 
Q: Okay. Tell me how far up it was Bristol after you made a left. 
 
A: Could have been the second house -- they  are big houses. Could have been 
the second -- it wasn't the first house. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: That's the white house with the white  wall. It either had to be the second or 
the third house. I don't know for sure. 
 
Q: Okay. And is there a sidewalk on this street? 
 
Did you have to walk along the sidewalk,  or do you have to walk in the street? 
 
A: I don't remember. I couldn't answer  that. 
 
Q: Okay. And when you got to the house, he had told you where the trash cans 
were?  Did you make a left 
 
A: No, he hadn't finished his question yet. 
 
Q: I understood you  
 
MR. LEONARD: I didn't know that  Was that  the end of a question? 
 
MR. KELLY: No. I stopped because... 
 
Q: As you walked up, as you made a left and headed up Bristol, how far up 
Bristol did you go before you stopped? 
 
A: Not that far. It was shorter than halfway up the block. 
 
Q: Okay. And to the best of your recollection, was it the second or third house? 
 
A: Could have been either the second or the third house. 
 
Q: And when you got to that particular house, what, if anything, did you do? 
 
A: From what he had told me, I assumed that I was at the right house because I 
walked back of the drive  I mean the driveway along the side of the  house, 
and just as I gotten to like the backyard area, still cement  I didn't have to 
crawl  open any  fence or gates or anything. It was just wide open  as I got 
back there I saw the garbage cans, and I opened up the lid and there it was. 
 
Q: So you had to walk up someone's driveway  from the street  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  to get to the garbage cans.  And could you just approximate the distance 
you had to walk from the street up the driveway to the garbage cans to get to 
them? 
 
A: A few yards. Five yards. 
 
Q: That's it? 
 
A: Yeah, I guess. 
 
Q: And the house  and the garbage cans  were next to the house? 
 
A: Just as you got in the driveway, it kinda opened up to a larger area, and just 
as I turned -- looked to my right, the garbage cans were right there. 
 
Q: Okay. And how many garbage cans were there? 
 
A: I couldn't give you an exact number. It  was more than two. 
 
Q: And did you find the bag the first  garbage can you opened? 
 
A: I think so, yeah. 
 
Q: And could you describe the size of the bag with the jewelry in it? 
 
A:(Indicating). Probably the size of my  hand, maybe a little larger. I don't 
know. I was able to pick it up with one hand and carry it in one  hand. 
 
Q: Okay. And it was a cloth bag of some sort? 
 
A: Cloth, velvet, something like that. 
 
Q: Okay. All right. Did Simpson tell you  why he had left his car in Schwartz's 
garage when he went back to Rockingham? 
 
A: Up until I got to Alan's that morning, that Alan told me, you know, O.J. had 
keys to his car or lost the keys to his car. I never asked. 
 
Q: Okay. My question is: Did Simpson tell  you why he had left his own car --  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- is, Schwartz's garage? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Simpson ever tell you why he had  taken Schwartz's car back to 
Rockingham and not his own? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation 
 
THE WITNESS: I found out later on that the  police were looking for him. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Did Simpson tell you why he parked Schwartz's car up the street on 
Ashford instead of in  his own driveway? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR.LEONARD: Object.  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did Simpson tell you why he had gone over Von Watts' five-foot wall 
instead of using his own  front gate? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Simpson tell you why he had taken that black bag of jewelry from his 
house?   
 
A: No.   
 
Q: Did Simpson tell you why he had hid that black bag in a neighbor's garbage 
can? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Simpson tell you how he had dropped  the keys to Alan Schwartz's car? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection, lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: No.   
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did Simpson tell you how he had done all  these various things without the 
neighbors seeing or  hearing him around his house at Rockingham? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation, and lack of foundation --   
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
MR.LEONARD: -- assumes facts not in evidence. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did Simpson tell you how he had gotten back in and out of Rockingham 
without Michelle,  Arnelle, Ruth or Nicole seeing him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Did Simpson tell you why he had left Schwartz's house with 
Schwartz's car without  telling Alan Schwartz? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know anything about that. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. At any time after June 12th, 1994 -- okay? We are up to June 12th, 
1994 now.  Okay? 
 
Did Simpson ever tell you how he had left Nicole's condo on 875 South Bundy 
without being seen or heard by the neighbors on the night of June 12th, 1994? 
 
MR. RE: Wait a second. What is this, again? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection. 
 
MR.KELLY: This is June 12th, 1994. 
 
MR.RE: Up until that time did he tell him what happened on  
 
MR. KELLY: No. 
 
Q: After  on the night of June 12th did  Simpson tell you anything about 
leaving the Bundy condo that night without being seen or heard by  neighbors? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection. 
 
MR.RE: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm not  clear whether you are posing a 
question about  something that supposedly was told to him on June 12th  or was 
told to him about something that happened on  June 12th. 
 
MR.KELLY: I'm posing a question to him about  something he may have been 
told happened on June 12th. 
 
MR. RE: Told at any time?  In other words  
 
MR. KELLY: Yes. 
 
MR. RE:  are you saying this had to be told to him on June 12th? 
 
MR. KELLY: No. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Obviously after June 12th. 
 
MR. KELLY: After June 12th. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Could not have been told before June 12th. Unless -- 
 
MR. RE: No, but it sounded like you were saying, were you told on June 12th 
about this thing. 
 
MR. KELLY: No, no. At any time after June 12th. 
 
MR. RE: Were you told at any time after  June 12th... 
 
MR. KELLY: How Simpson may have left Nicole's condo at 875 South Bundy 
on the night of June 12th,  1994 without being seen or heard. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Okay. I am going to object  because it lacks foundation, calls 
for speculation, assumes facts not in evidence. 
 
MR. RE: Let me tell you something: I don't think there is any possibility of an 
individual being able to answer that question. 
 
MR. LEONARD: And it's vague. 
 
MR. KELLY: Why is that? 
 
MR. RE: Because it presumes that something was  told to him without even 
asking him the question of  whether anything like that was ever talked about. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Let me ask you: Did Simpson ever  tell you that he was at Nicole's 
condo on the night of  June 12th, 1994 and left there that night without being 
seen or heard by any neighbors? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
MR. RE: If you are asking whether he was told  that during the period of time 
we have been excluding him -- excluding, then I will advise him to assert a  
privilege as to anything he may have been told during  that period of time. If 
you want to ask him about  some other time, that's fine. 
 
MR. KELLY: Well, first of all, I will ask him during that period of time. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I am going to object to lack of  foundation. 
 
MR. RE: We'll assert a privilege as to whatever he was told about anything 
during that period  of time, without any assumption that he was told anything 
like that. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. Well, I will ask him both ways then. 
 
Q: Did Simpson ever tell you that he had  left Nicole's condo at 875 South 
Bundy the night of  June 12th, 1994 without being seen or heard by any  
neighbors? Did he ever tell you that? 
 
MR. RE: And he has to assert a privilege to that. 
 
THE WITNESS: Privilege. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Did Simpson ever tell you at any time after June 12th, 1994 that he 
had left 875 South  Bundy, Nicole's condo, that night without being seen  or 
heard by Sydney or Justin? 
 
MR. RE: You are assuming that  including that same period? 
 
MR. KELLY: Yeah. 
 
MR. RE: Okay. You are doing this clearly so that you can relate the fact that 
Mr. Cowlings asserted a privilege to this particular area, which is kind of useless 
because we have indicated to you he is going to assert a privilege with regard to 
coming by information during that period. 
 
If you are not interested in whether he heard it at some other time, we will assert 
the privilege, so --  
 
MR. KELLY: Well, I am trying to do it both  ways: Within that time period or 
at any time excluding that time period. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Well, ask it that way then, John. 
 
MR. BREWER: He did. 
 
MR. KELLY: I thought I had. 
 
MR. LEONARD: No, not the last question. 
 
MR. KELLY: Could we have that last question  read back again? 
 
MR. RE: \Why don't you repose it so we don't  have to have it read back. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
Q: At any time  these will be all at any time after June 12th, 1994  did 
Simpson tell you  
 
MR. RE: See, this is what the problem is. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
MR. RE: Let me make a suggestion. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
MR. RE: You can ask the question any way you  want, but this is the problem I 
am having. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
MR. RE: If you were to break it up to say during this particular period that we 
are excluding  were you asked, he will assert a privilege, and then if you want to 
ask after that period of time were you  told it, then he will be able to answer the 
question. 
 
When you ask the question, "At any time,"  then he has to assert the privilege to 
it. It appears  that he is asserting a privilege to a period of  time  
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. Well, that's fine because  what you have suggested, I was 
doing just the opposite. I was going to come back then and ask about  that 
specific period. 
 
MR. RE: The problem we have is the privilege may be asserted then too 
broadly, because when you say  "at any time"  
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. That's fine. I still have to make my record, and you are 
more than welcome to assert it, and I will take your suggestion: I will  ask it the 
opposite. 
 
MR. RE: Okay. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: At any time between June 13th and June 17th, 1994 did Mr. Simpson ever 
tell you that he was able to leave 875 South Bundy the night of June 12th, 1994 
without ever being seen or heard by any neighbors? 
 
MR. RE: And because  
 
MR. LEONARD: Let me object. I am going to object. Lack of foundation, and 
it assumes facts not in evidence. 
 
MR. RE: And because we are asserting a  privilege to that period of time, I am 
asking Mr.  advising Mr. Cowlings to assert a privilege. 
 
THE WITNESS: Privilege. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. At any time after June 17th  Or would you prefer June 18th? 
 
MR. RE: I think June 18th is better than June 17th. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
Q: On June 18th or any time thereafter, did  Mr. Simpson ever  I am sorry. 
Did you want to say  something else? 
 
MR. RE: (Shakes head.)   
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. On June 18th or any time  thereafter, did Mr. Simpson ever tell you 
how he had left 875 South Bundy the night of June 12th, 1994  without ever 
being seen or heard? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
MR. RE: Could you please ask him if he said anything about leaving? In other 
words, you are asking him, did he tell you how he left. That's the how  you 
know, did he tell you he stopped beating his wife  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Suppose O.J. Simpson said,  "Mr. Cowlings, let me tell 
you exactly how I did it"? 
 
MR. RE: But isn't the  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's what John's asking him. 
 
MR. RE: The preliminary question is, did he tell you that he left? Then, did he 
tell you how he left? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He doesn't have to ask it that  way. 
 
MR. KELLY: I don't have to ask it in the light  most favorable to your client as 
he testifies, Mr. Re. 
 
MR. RE: No, no, but you are asking  the question is, did he tell you how he 
left, presupposes that he told him that he was there and left. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He has objected on the grounds of lack of foundation, and 
if you're right, that objection will be sustained and this answer will be of  no 
consequence. 
 
MR. RE: Well, I want to make sure that he knows what he's being asked so that 
he knows what he's answering. If you want to ask it that way, I can't control it, 
but... 
 
MR. KELLY: Could we have the last question  read back again? 
 
(Pending question read as follows: 
 
"Q. Okay. On June 18th  or any time thereafter, did Mr.  Simpson ever tell you 
how he had left 875 South Bundy the night of  June 12th, 1994 without ever 
being seen or heard?") 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.  Assumes facts not in 
evidence. 
 
MR. RE: Go ahead.  
 
THE WITNESS: No.   
 
MR. KELLY: That was pretty painless, wasn't  it? 
 
Q: Okay. Did he ever tell you that he had  been over there at all that night?   
 
MR. RE Again  
 
MR. KELLY: On June 12th, 1994. 
 
Q: Did he ever tell you between June 13th and June 17th, 1994 that he had been 
over at Nicole's condo the night of June 12th, 1994? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
MR. RE.: Because we are asserting a privilege to that time period, I advise him 
to assert the privilege. 
 
THE WITNESS: Privilege.

question, which is, I presume, the way he answered the question also. But go

BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: On June 18th or any time thereafter did Mr. Simpson ever discuss with you

On June 18th or any time thereafter, did  Mr. Simpson ever ask you to retrieve 
clothes, Bruno  Magli shoes or a knife that he had disposed of on the  night of 
June 12th, 1994? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Never. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. At any time after June 12th,  1994  Strike that. We will do it Mr. 
Re's way. At any time between June 13th and  June 17th, 1994 did you ever tell 
anybody that in the  early morning hours of New Year's Day, 1989 how  Mr. 
Simpson had parked up the street from his house  when he returned to the house 
that morning? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
MR. RE: I don't understand it, but I think he is going to assert a privilege.   
 
THE WITNESS: Hold it. You said  
 
MR.PETROCELLI: No. He said something about  '89. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. I think he started with  '94. Can I have the question over 
again?   
 
MR. KELLY: Yeah. In general terms I'm asking,  in '94 if he related to anybody 
what had happened in  '89.   
 
MR. RE: In other words, in the excluded period did he ever tell anybody about 
the '89 incident? 
 
MR. KELLY: Yeah. 
 
MR. RE: Okay. He's going to assert   
 
MR. KELLY: That's generally. I am going to ask it a little more specifically, but 
that's just to let him know what I'm talking  
 
MR. RE: He will assert a privilege to that. 
 
He's asking about, did anybody tell you  during the period of time that we are 
excluding, so you assert a privilege to that... 
 
MR. KELLY: No. Did he ever tell anybody about  this '89 incident of Simpson 
parking up the street, hiding the bag  
 
MR. RE: You're asking  
 
MR. KELLY:  going over walls and everything else. 
 
MR.RE: You are asking whether during the  excluded period  
 
MR. KELLY: Right. 
 
MR. RE:  he discussed that with  he discussed the '89 incident with 
anyone? 
 
MR. KELLY: Right. 
 
MR. RE: So I am advising him to take a privilege with regard to whether he had 
any such  conversations during that excluded period. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. I will ask about four specific questions, but that's where we 
are with that. 
 
Q: Between June 13th and June 17th,1994 did  you ever tell anybody how in the 
early morning hours of New Year's Day, 1989 Mr. Simpson had parked a car up 
the street and gone back down to his property after  the police had left there? 
 
A: Privilege. 
 
Q: Okay. Between June 13th  
 
MR. RE: Let me refine that, because you did  ask him questions that had to do 
with that time period  in which Mr. Cowlings was speaking to the police who  
were up at Rockingham, and he has answered those  questions. So if you want to 
ask him whether he  discussed that with the police, we wouldn't be  asserting a 
privilege to that. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. I thought that fell within the 13th there. 
 
MR. RE: No, but we have tried to narrow it down to not only the time frame, 
but also to whom he  is talking, and as far as the conversations with the police 
that he has had during that period of time when  they  when he went up to 
Rockingham after being  notified of the murders, we have allowed him to  
testify to that. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
Q: When you talked to the police that early  morning on June 13th, 1994  
 
Do you recall when you arrived there and Fuhrman and Vannatter and Lange 
and Phillips were  there? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  did you ever tell them anything about  what had happened at Rockingham 
early New Year's morning in 1989? 
 
MR. LEONARD: I am going to object. Lack of  foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever tell anybody between  the 13th and 17th of June, 1994 
what Mr. Simpson had  done in terms of his actions in getting on and off the  
property at Rockingham in the early morning hours of  1989? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.  Vague. 
 
MR. RE: And I think this is the one he has  already asserted the privilege to. 
 
THE WITNESS: Privilege. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever tell anybody between  June 13th and June 17th, 1994 
about how Mr. Simpson in  the early morning hours of 1989 New Year's Day 
had dropped keys going over a five-foot fence to get onto Von Watts' property? 
 
Did you ever tell anybody about that incident between June 13th and June 17th? 
 
A: Privilege. 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
MR. RE: But with the exception, you can ask  him about telling the police on 
that morning that he  arrived, if he did, and I think he has indicated he  hasn't. 
 
MR. KELLY: That's correct. 
 
Q: You indicated that first morning you were  there you never talked to the cops 
 
 
MR. RE: About anything.  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q:  about anything that happened in the New Year's morning of '89. Is that 
correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Now I am asking you, at any other time between June 13th and June 17th if 
you related to  anybody this New Year's morning '89 incident where Simpson 
had hopped over Von Watts' five-foot wall, lost his keys, taken a jewelry bag, 
hid the jewelry bag in a neighbor's trash can and then gotten back to  Schwartz's 
house in the early morning hours? 
 
Did you ever talk to anybody about that between June 13th and June 17th, 
1994? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.  Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: Privilege. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: At any time on June 18th or thereafter, did you ever discuss with anybody 
Mr. Simpson's actions of that early morning hour on New Year's Day, 1989 
where he had parked Mr. Schwartz's car up the  street on Ashford, gone over the 
five-foot wall at Von Watts, dropped car keys, hid a black jewelry bag in 
someone else's trash can and then got back to  Schwartz's house?  Did you ever 
discuss that with anybody on June 18th or any time thereafter? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
MR. RE You are excluding any conversations he may have had with his 
counsel, I presume? 
 
MR. KELLY: Yes. 
 
MR. RE And you are excluding his having  answered your questions? 
 
MR. KELLY: Yes. 
 
MR. RE Okay. 
 
THE WITNESS: So I  
 
MR. RE: Other than talking to me about it, if you did, or talking to them about 
it. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: So other than the testimony you've given,  your sworn testimony here the last 
couple days, you've never discussed with anybody else what happened that  
early morning hour on New Year's Day, 1989? 
 
MR. RE: With the potential of his lawyer  
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
MR. RE:  being excluded? 
 
MR. KELLY: Yes, of course. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
MR. KELLY: I hate to exclude you, Mr. Re, but  
 
MR. RE: That's okay. I don't feel left out. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Never discussed it with anybody. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Never told anybody. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. You had indicated that  
 
MR. RE: And by the way, you do that. You say,  "Never. "Never." I presume 
you are limiting those  kinds of follow-ups as follow-ups to the preceding 
questions always. 
 
MR. KELLY: Always to the preceding questions  and always with the 
recognition you are excluding  those dates. 
 
MR. RE: Thank you. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
Q: You indicated the other day that there came a time after June 13th at some 
point you had walked out back behind the guesthouse at Rockingham.  Is that 
correct? 
 
MR. RE: I'm sorry. The time on June 13th? 
 
MR. KELLY: No. No. He said sometime after that. He wasn't able to set a date. 
 
MR. RE: Are you talking about the time he went  back with the investigator? 
 
MR. KELLY: No. Before that he had gone back  by himself. 
 
MR. RE: Okay. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Do you recall that testimony? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you go there by yourself? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you see anybody else when you were back there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you talk to anybody else while you were back there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you go anywhere else back there  besides behind the guesthouse? 
 
A: I think I walked through the full length of the walkway to the  it's a back 
area back there. 
 
Q: Okay. Was there anything that you found  back there during your own 
investigation that day? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the term "investigation." 
 
THE WITNESS: Didn't find anything.   
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Didn't remove anything?   
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. The other day you also indicated  that when you went back there 
subsequently or afterwards with an investigator, you talked to him about the 
different ways to get onto the property? 
 
A: Yeah. Not different ways, but it seems  it would have been -- if O.J. did come 
that way, it  would have been easier to come a different way. 
 
Q: Well, what other ways are there onto the  property? 
 
A: Across his tennis court from his  neighbor's house. 
 
Q: Okay. If you were to Where is the front of  That's Von Watts' property? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And where is the front of their house?  Is that on Ashford? 
 
A: No. It's on Bristol. 
 
Q: Okay. And how would you get to the front  of that house if you had parked 
your car at the gate at Rockingham? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: How would you get to where? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Asks him to speculate. 
 
THE WITNESS: To whose house?   
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: How would you get to Von Watts' house to  come back through that way if 
you started at the front  gate of the Rockingham entrance? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.  Calling for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: If you outside on Ashford, you'd walk down the street. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: You'd have to walk down Ashford to there.  Is that correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And could you tell me any other  way onto the property? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.  Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: You asked me how to get from  if you parked on Ashford, 
how to get to Von Watts'  house? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Well  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No. Rockingham, he said. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: If you park on Rockingham, the gate at Rockingham  
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q:  how would you be able to end up going through the tennis court of Von 
Watts to Simpson's  house? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.  Calling for speculation. 
 
MR. RE: You are just asking him physically how you would  
 
MR. KELLY: Yeah. 
 
Q: Describe it. What would you do? 
 
MR. RE: In other words, he is asking you how do you physically, 
geographically -- 
 
THE WITNESS: On Rockingham, okay, if I come through O.J.'s gate and 
walked on the outside through  his tennis court to the Von Wattses. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. But what if you had parked there  and you wanted to get onto the 
property? 
 
A: Onto? 
 
Q: Simpson's property through Von Watts. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I am sorry. Can you repeat the  question? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Let me make it easy. 
 
A: Go ahead. 
 
Q: If you were to pull up and park on  Rockingham at the gate to Mr. Simpson's 
house  
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q:  and you then wanted to get to the Von Watts property, to cut through to 
his house, you  would have to walk down to the corner of Ashford, walk  all the 
way up Ashford and turn right on Bristol and  then come back through, would 
you not? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calling for speculation. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, or you could go through O.J.'s property. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Assuming you didn't want to go through  the property and you wanted to 
come in some other  way. That's what I am asking you. 
 
A: Either   
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.  Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Either O.J.'s property or you walk down Ashford. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Can you move  
 
THE WITNESS: Can you go this way (Indicating)? No, there's a  
 
MR. LEONARD: Who's asking questions? Is that a question, Mr. Petrocelli? 
 
MR. KELLY: That's a whisper. Those don't  count. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Since he's on the same point,  I figured he might as well 
answer that question. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Well, why don't we let Mr. Kelly  ask the questions. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Because he might not think of  asking it. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I can't imagine he wouldn't.  Wait. Is there a question? 
 
THE WITNESS: Go ahead. 
 
MR. KELLY: Strike it. Strike it. 
 
Q: You were having a discussion with the  investigator as to why Mr. Simpson 
would have possibly  come over the Cyclone fence behind the guesthouse. Is  
that correct? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: Cyclone? What's a Cyclone? 
 
BY MR. KELLY:   
 
Q: Cyclone. 
 
A: What's that? That's a western term? 
 
Q: A metal  Midwest. A metal fence.  Right? 
 
A: Wire fence? 
 
Q: Wire fence. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And then you said it didn't make sense  because there are other ways that 
would be easier to  get into the property. Correct? 
 
A: Yeah, that's primarily the way. I used it -- 
 
Q: But  
 
A: Go ahead. 
 
Q: But under the same circumstances, assuming Mr. Simpson had parked  
assuming now, the  same discussion, he had parked his Bronco at the front  gate 
of Rockingham on Rockingham, how would he have  gotten to Von Watts' to 
come back through the tennis  court? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Asked and answered.  Lack of foundation. Calls 
for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: O.J. pulls up on Rockingham. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Right. 
 
A: He gets on his own property to get to the  Von Watts'. Is that what you're 
saying? 
 
Q: No. I'm saying  
 
A: Oh, how would he? 
 
Q: To get to his property from Von Watts'. 
 
A: If he's on Rockingham? 
 
Q: If he parks his car there and he wants to, say, get in the front door without 
being seen from Ashford. 
 
A: He'll walk down Ashford. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. Calls for speculation.  
 
THE WITNESS: He will walk down Ashford.   
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Right. He would have to walk down  Ashford to Bristol. Correct? 
 
A: Yeah. Or if he came through his gate,  walk his own property, go across his 
tennis court into  the Von Watts' and come back that way. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: I am asking you, assuming he didn't want  to come in through his own gate 
for whatever reason,  what his other alternatives would have been, Mr. 
Cowlings. 
 
A: Ashford. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for  speculation. Lack of foundation. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: He would have had to walk up Ashford to  Bristol. Is that correct? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Same objection, and  asked and answered probably 
seven times. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Now, what would be another option  for getting on his property? You 
said there was a number of other ways  he could have gotten on there besides 
coming over that metal fence. One is through Von Watts. Correct? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Wait a minute. I am objecting to  the first part of the question. 
Misstates his  evidence. 
 
MR. KELLY: Which part is misstated,  Mr. Leonard? 
 
MR. LEONARD: When you talk about a "number" of  different ways. 
 
MR. KELLY: I believe he said in his testimony  there were several ways to get 
into his own property  other than coming over that metal fence. 
 
MR. LEONARD: In the context of what you've just talked about? 
 
MR. KELLY: Sure. He's standing back there  with the investigator, and he  
 
MR. LEONARD: With that scenario, with the car  parked on Rockingham, is 
that what you're saying? 
 
MR. KELLY: Well, that's what I'm trying to establish, that there weren't too 
many different  scenarios of how Mr. Simpson could have gotten in except 
coming over that fence, with that scenario. 
 
MR. LEONARD: The assumption you are making in  the beginning of your 
question, I object that it  misstates his former testimony. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Let's see if we can make it simpler.  Assuming you were parked at the 
Rockingham gate of the estate and there was someone else parked at the 
Ashford gate facing in towards the front door, can you tell me how you could 
get onto that property without  being seen other than going over the fence 
behind the  guesthouse? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: So now you're speaking of O.J.'s property, not speaking of 
Von Watts' property? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: I am talking about any way he could have  gotten onto his property -- 
 
A: On his property. 
 
Q: Yeah.  with the car parked at Rockingham and someone at the Ashford 
gate looking in towards the front door. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation,  Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: If it was O.J., he has a key that opens this gate (Indicating) to 
come onto his  property. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: But that goes right up the driveway to  the front door, does it not? 
 
A: This driveway, yes, to the garage and to  the front door. 
 
Q: And if you are facing in from the Ashford  gate, facing that way, you can see 
the front door and  the driveway and the garage, can you not? 
 
A: You can see the front of the house. You  can see  you can't actually see the 
front door. 
 
Q: Okay. But you can see the front of the house and the garage area and 
driveway area, can you not? 
 
A: Yes, sir. 
 
Q: Okay. If you didn't want to be seen in  the front door area or the garage area 
or the driveway area, if you didn't want to be seen coming in what  other way 
could you have gotten onto the property? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.  Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: That I don't know. You asking me something you want me to 
assume   
 
BY MR. KELLY:  
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A:  and I can't assume.  
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: All I know, there's a gate there  (Indicating) that puts you on the driveway 
from off of  Rockingham. 
 
Q: Right. 
 
A: There is another gate on Ashford. If  that Ashford gate is blocked, like you 
said, with the  driver, to get on if you parked here (Indicating),  either  you 
come through that gate. 
 
Q: But you would be visible to someone at Ashford, coming through that gate, 
would you not? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: If he's looking in there, yes. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Calls for speculation. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. So how  is there any other way  he could get onto the property other 
then coming  through the gate on Rockingham? 
 
MR. RE: Except the Ashford gate, other than the Rockingham gate. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: Rockingham gate. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Without being seen. 
 
MR. KELLY: Without being seen. 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.  Calls for speculation. Asked 
and answered. You are now badgering the witness. 
 
MR. RE: And I have to ask you one thing  because I'm not clear about part of 
this question:  When you say, "any other way," you're comparing one  way, as I 
understand it, as being near the air  conditioner and coming around the front of 
the house?  Is that what you're talking about? 
 
Because if you are talking about that,  somebody from Ashford theoretically 
could see, I  guess, the driveway and the front of the house that way, too. So 
when you say "other way," I'm not sure what you are talking about, because you 
could be seen  that way. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: I will ask you something else: Were there back entrances to the house behind 
the guesthouse there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: There is no entrance to the garage back there that runs along that fence? 
 
A: Are you speaking  when you say the "back," I'm speaking all the way to 
the back. When  you speak of the back, you  
 
Q: This area behind the guesthouses here (Indicating). 
 
A: Okay. That's the side of the house.   
 
Q: On the side of the house are there any  entrances in the house there? 
 
A: To get into the house? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: There's two. 
 
Q: Which entrances are those? 
 
A: Off the garage and off the maid's room. 
 
Q: Okay. So if you were to come over the  fence there and go into one of those 
entrances to the  house, you could do that without being seen from the Ashford 
gate, could you not? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.  Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Come over what fence? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: The fence behind the guesthouse. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Same objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: The fence that runs along the  guesthouse on the side of the 
house? When you say  "back," I'm thinking of the back. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: I am talking about the fence that runs  along the guesthouse. You could climb 
over the fence  there and gain entry to the house without ever being  seen from 
Ashford, can you not? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.  Calls for speculation. 
 
MR.RE: When you say "you," you mean  Mr. Cowlings? Is that what you're 
talking about? 
 
MR. KELLY: I am sorry. What? 
 
MR. RE: When you say "you," you mean  Mr. Cowlings? Because there may be 
a key on the door. I don't know what you are asking him. I mean,  is it 
physically possible to move from that back fence  to the back door? 
 
MR. KELLY: Yeah. 
 
Q: Is that, first of all? 
 
A: That I don't know. I've never done it. 
 
Q: Are there doors that you can walk in and out of the house and walk to the 
back gate there  
 
A: Excuse me? You said what, sir? 
 
Q: Are there doors that you can walk in- and outside of the house that run along 
that back    
 
A: That side. 
 
Q:  passageway? 
 
A: That side. 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: That could put you on the side of the  house? 
 
Q: Right. 
 
A. There's two doors, yes. 
 
Q: There's two doors.  So if someone were to come over that  fence behind there 
where that passageway runs, they could gain entry to the house without being 
seen from  the Ashford gate, could they not? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.  Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: They could come over that fence, yes. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: And get into the house without being seen  or visible from the Ashford gate. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Thank you, Mr. Cowlings. 
 
MR. RE: Ask the right question, get the right  answer. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
Q: On June 12th, 1994, could you tell me  where you were that night between, 
say, 9:00 p.m. and  12:00 p.m.? 
 
MR. RE: Now, he is happy to tell you. We are very concerned about the 
identities of these people  becoming public. Is there any way I could give you  
their names  
 
MR. KELLY: Let's go off the record for a  minute. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record  now, and the time is 
approximately 2:03. 
 
(Discussion held off the record.) 
 
(Plaintiffs' exhibit 179 was marked  for identification by the reporter and is 
attached hereto.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the time is 
approximately 2:19. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Mr. Cowlings, it's my understanding that  you were at a party on the night of 
June 12th, 1994. Is that correct?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And could you tell me geographically  approximately where this party was 
at? 
 
A: Baldwin Hills, which is a suburb I'd say close to the Los Angeles Airport. 
 
Q: And could you tell me approximately how  many other people were at that 
party that night? 
 
A: There was a number of people. I couldn't  give you an exact number, but it 
was quite a few.

A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And was there someone who went  with you when you went to the

Q: Are you certain it was after 11:00 p.m.? 
 
A: Could have been. Could have been 11:30. 
 
Q: Could it have been anytime earlier than 11:00 p.m.? 
 
A: I don't know. I doubt it. 
 
MR. RE: You are asking for his best  recollection? 
 
MR. KELLY: Yeah, his best recollection. 
 
MR. RE: That's what he's saying. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, 11:00, 11:30. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. Could it have been as early as 10:30 you left there? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: No, I don't think so. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: You're certain it wasn't as early as  10:30? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know what time it was. I  know it was a school night, a 
Sunday night, and I went home. I couldn't tell you exactly what time. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Could you tell me what time you arrived  home? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Could you tell me approximately what time  you arrived home? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did anybody ride home with you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you drop anybody off on the way home? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Could you provide to me the names of the  last people you spoke to before 
leaving that party?

you recall the  names of the last people you spoke to or were with before leaving 
that party? 
 
A: I don't know who I spoke to last. 
 
Q: Okay. How many people, approximately,  were at this party when you left 
there that night to come back home? 
 
A: I couldn't tell you how many people were  there. I don't know the exact 
number. 
 
Q: Were there more than 20 people there when  you left the party that night? 
 
A: I really didn't notice.

MR. LEONARD: Object to the compound nature of the question. 
 
MR. RE: What was the question? 
 
MR. KELLY: Could you read it back, please. 
 
(Pending question read.) 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object. Compound -- 
 
MR. RE: He has indicated  
 
MR. LEONARD:  vague. 
 
MR. RE: I'm sorry. He has indicated he is going to give you a list of names of 
people who were there. I think some of them can. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
Q: And you drove directly from the party  home that night of June 12th, 1994?

to where you lived? 
 
A: 405 north to Sunset, Sunset west to the Palisades. 
 
Q: You live in the Palisades?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And you can't tell me exactly what time you got home that night? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Asked and answered. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: And you can't tell me exactly what time  you left the party that night? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Asked and answered. 
 
MR. RE: You've already asked him that  question. 
 
THE WITNESS: I couldn't give you an exact, no. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
MR. RE: He has told you his best recollection: 11:00 or 11:30. 
 
MR. KELLY: Excuse me one second. 
 
Q: Since Mr. Simpson's release from prison,  do you know of any affirmative 
steps he has taken to locate the real killers of Nicole Brown Simpson and  Ron 
Goldman? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Has he ever discussed that with you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever heard him mention that he was going to conduct a search for 
the real killers  after his release from prison? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: But you have never discussed that search with him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And you wouldn't be able to tell me anything he has done in an attempt to 
locate the real  killers of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Could you tell me anything more that you,  yourself, Mr. Cowlings, have 
done to locate the real killers of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman other  
than those conversations you had with some of Nicole's friends approximately 
two weeks after their murders?   
 
Q: No. Nothing else you've done?   
 
A: No. 
 
Q: By the way, as of June 12th, 1994, do you think Mr. Simpson was physically 
capable of killing Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.  Calls for speculation. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: You don't think he had the physical  capability of killing Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.  Calls  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: You don't think he had the strength? 
 
MR. LEONARD:  for speculation.  I'm sorry. 
 
THE WITNESS: I know he didn't kill her. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Based on what? 
 
A: That he didn't kill her. 
 
Q: Do you have any factual basis for saying that Simpson did not kill Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Any evidence? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Any explanation for the blood evidence  against him? 
 
A: Don't know anything about the blood. 
 
Q: You don't know anything about Ron and Nicole's blood found in his Bronco? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You don't know anything about his blood being at Bundy? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You don't know anything about -- 
 
MR. RE: Wait a second. Wait, wait, wait.  These questions are really confusing. 
When you say, "You don't know anything about" it, I mean, are you asking 
whether he has heard about news reports, or are  you talking about whether he 
knows specific, or are you asking him whether he knows how it got there if it 
got there? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Everything. 
 
MR. RE: Well. I mean, everybody in the world  has heard about the case, so  
 
THE WITNESS: I have no personal knowledge. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: So other than the fact that you just  don't think Simpson killed Nicole, you 
have no other  basis for that statement? 
 
A: No, I don't. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Would it be fair to say that that statement is based on the fact that Mr. 
Simpson is your best friend? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative. Lack  of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I have stated before, he has told me that he didn't commit the 
murders. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: And when was that?  
 
A: Since he's been out.  
 
Q: Has he told you that more than once? 
 
MR. RE: Well, wait a second. Excluding the period? 
 
MR. KELLY: Well, he said, "Since he's been out," so that clearly excludes the 
period. 
 
MR. RE: Well, but your question didn't. If  your question is limited to since he's 
been out, I  have no objection or no advice or nothing. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Well, what exactly did he tell you since  he's been out about how he didn't 
murder Nicole? 
 
A: He didn't kill them. 
 
Q: Is that all he said to you: He shrugged his shoulders and said he didn't kill 
her? 
 
A: No, he didn't shrug his shoulders. He  said he didn't kill them. 
 
Q: Did he say anything before that or after  that short sentence about whether he 
killed Nicole or not? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: And you didn't ask anything else?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever set up a 900 phone  number? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. What period of time did you set up  that number? 
 
A: Last year, I guess. Yeah, would have been last year. It was '95. 
 
Q: Okay. And what was the purpose of that  number? 
 
A: I had been approached by various people.  One thing led to another. The 
phone line at the time  seemed like it was the most sane thing to do. People  
were approaching me, offering me great sums of money. 
 
Q: Who had approached you? 
 
A: It was a number of people. 
 
Q: Can you name a couple for me, please? 
 
A: Couldn't name them. There was a group  out of Florida. There was a group 
that was  corresponding with me through the mail and  from the Midwest or 
back East somewhere. 
 
MR. RE: Is this limited to just for the 900  number or people who approached 
him with a bunch of money? 
 
MR. KELLY: Well, I digressed on my question. I had originally mentioned the 
900 number, but he  started talking about people that had offered him large 
sums of money, so I want to explore that a  little bit. 
 
THE WITNESS: The phone thing, people was  offering, you know, things, you 
know, mentioned a  great deal of money. 
 
MR. RE: I have to remind A.C. then about the National Enquirer for a million 
dollars? 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, the National Enquirer had  offered me a great deal of 
money. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: National Enquirer offered you over a  million dollars? 
 
MR. RE: 1. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, $1 million. 
 
BY MR. KELLY:  For what? 
 
A: For my story, I guess. 
 
Q: Was it  did it include the date of June 17th? 
 
A: I never spoke to them. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever read anything they had written you? 
 
A: I used to throw it away. 
 
Q: Okay. Did they offer you a million dollars in writing for your story? 
 
A: There were notes and letters left at my house. I assume it was from them. It 
was their  stationery. 
 
Q: Okay. Other than the National Enquirer,  who else offered you a substantial 
amount of money? 
 
A: People from the  people that approached me, the groups that would call me 
to  about the 900  number. 
 
Q: Okay. And what was set up for the 900  number? 
 
A: My  we set it up ourselves and --  
 
Q: Who is "we"? 
 
A: My friend Mike Pulwer. We decided  Mike literally told me, he says, 
"Why  should we"  you know, "If you're going to do this"without me 
knowing, he had investigated the 900 phone line business, and I said, you know, 
we  could do it ourselves. 
 
Q: And what did you do? 
 
A: We set up the 900 number for people who wanted to know or had questions 
pertaining to O.J. and Nicole, nothing that it was gonna be trash or  you 
know, they were going to get the truth, the facts from me about O.J. and Nicole. 
 
Q: And were you going to speak to these  people who called yourself? 
 
A: I spoke to them, yes. 
 
Q: And do you recall what month of last year  this was set up?  This was in '95? 
 
A: Yeah.  I don't know. We ran for I guess  about  I don't know. Ran for some 
months. We had recorded messages going there. I would go online hour a day, 
seven days a week, and answer the calls  personally with the people. 
 
Q: Did you keep the tape recordings of the taped messages you left on the 900 
number? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Could you tell me if anybody did? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did  
 
A: The phone service up in  the phone  service that handled it, it was BFD out 
of Vegas. 
 
Q: I am sorry. BF-  
 
A: BFD out of Las Vegas. 
 
Q: B as in boy, F as in Frank, D as in dog    
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q:  Service in Las Vegas? 
 
A: Yes, that's the phone service.  
 
Q: And did anybody speak on that line other  than you? You mentioned your 
friend, who is your partner also? 
 
A: No. Mike just  he put  you know, did he legwork and all that. No, just 
me. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever discuss with anybody  who called in the events between 
June 13th and June l7th? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever discuss the events of  June 12th at all with anybody who called 
in? 
 
A: Through the advice of my lawyer, and I  was subpoenaed by the defense, and 
Ito's guidelines,  we're not to discuss anything about the case, and so I didn't. So 
any time any people  anybody who talked to me live would say something, I 
would tell them that  I was unable talk about it; or if they asked about  what 
procedures were going on in court, I told them I  was unable to talk about it. 
 
Q: So it was basically you discussing the  relationship as you knew it between 
 
 
A: O.J. :and Nicole. 
 
Q:  Nicole and Simpson?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And how much did you make ultimately from this endeavor?   
 
A: We broke even. 
 
Q: That's all? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: BFD would have the tapes that you made during this period of time? 
 
A: I really don't know. 
 
Q: Did you ever see the tapes yourself? 
 
MR. RE: Excuse me. Are you thinking of  videotapes? 
 
MR. KELLY: As I understand it, they would have  been audiotapes. 
 
MR. RE: Audiotapes. 
 
THE WITINESS: Oh, the audiotapes were done here  not the audio  yeah, 
the audio. I'm sorry. We did it at a sound studio over in Hollywood, where I 
would go in and answer a number of questions  pertaining to the relationship 
between O.J. and  Nicole, some of the other stuff personal about me, and those 
would go on the 900 number. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: What was the name of the sound studio here that you'd go into? 
 
A: I don't know. I'd have to find out. It was on Hollywood Boulevard  no. 
Sunset. It was on  Sunset Boulevard. I'd have to find out.

A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did you ever discuss  or tape-record, I should ask. Did you ever tape 
record any information , regarding the state of the relationship between Nicole  
and Simpson the last two weeks before Nicole's murder? 
 
A: Did I tape?  
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Never discussed their relationship  
 
A: No. You said did I "tape." No, I didn't  tape.

A: I have no idea. 
 
Q: When Simpson and Nicole got divorced in 1992, did you discuss the fact that 
he was getting divorced, with Simpson?   
 
A: Did I discuss to who? 
 
Q: With Simpson the fact that he  
 
A: Did I discuss his divorce with him?  
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Not at all? 
  
A: It was none of my business. 
 
Q: Didn't talk to him about why he and Nicole were getting divorced? 
 
A: Like anything, it came to an end.

divorced?

A: Not that I remember, no. 
 
Q: Did Nicole ever tell you whose idea it  was to get divorced in 1992? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Were you aware of the fact that in  approximately April 1993 Nicole and 
Simpson got back together? 
 
A: I don't know if I did or not. 
 
Q: Well, you knew at some point after they  had gotten divorced, they got back 
together. Correct? 
 
A: Yeah. Yes. 
 
Q: Did Simpson ever tell you whose idea it  was to get back together when they

Q: Were you aware of the fact that in 1994,  shortly before Nicole's murder, that

A: No. Like I said, prior to the fender bender that she had with her car, I was 
under the impression they were still together 'cause they were  going to Cabo. 
 
Q: But after Cabo you never had any  discussions with Simpson regarding his 
relationship  with Nicole from that day to the day of Nicole's  murder? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Not that I could remember. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: And between the day you saw her when she was getting ready to leave to 
Cabo and the day of her  murder, did you ever discuss with Nicole the nature of

A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. I am going to ask you to listen to  a tape right now. Okay? 
 
THE REPORTER: Do you want me to -- 
 
MR. KELLY: No, you don't have to write it. Just  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Just put "Tape played." 
 
MR. KELLY: Just put "Tape played." (Whereupon an audiotape was played.) 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Mr. Cowlings, did you recognize Nicole's  voice on that tape? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you recognize Simpson's voice on that  tape?

Q: Okay. Moving to May 1994  are you with me? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  do you recall being at the Browns'  house in Laguna on Mother's 
Day? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Okay. And that was a Sunday? 
 
A: If it fell on Sunday, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall how you got down  there that day? 
 
A: I was there the night before. I think I  went out, went to a couple clubs down 
there and stayed over, and I called    
 
Q: Where did you stay, by the way? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: You didn't stay with Simpson, did you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: I called over to the Browns I think  earlier that week. Between either O.J. and 
Nicole,  they had said they were going to be in Laguna for the  weekend, so 
since I was down there, I said, "Well,, let me run by to see them." 
 
I called Judy. Judy said they were over at the  over at their condo. So I  I 
don't know  if I drove over there or if I called first, but I did go over to their 
condo over by the Ritz Carlton. 
 
Q: Okay. Were they there when you got  there? 
 
A: When I got there, Nicole was there. O.J. wasn't. 
 
Q: Did you have a conversation with Nicole  at that time? 
 
A: Yeah, briefly. She said O.J. had gone  out. He was in the car. That's what she 
said. I  think he went to go get some  went to get a  newspaper or some juice 
or something. So I called him in the car, let him know I was out there, and he 
said  he was on his way home. 
 
Q: Did Nicole say anything to you about any  fight they may have had the night 
before? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she seem upset in any way? 
 
A: No. She was straightening up around there, and we were going to wait for 
O.J. and go over  to her parents' house. 
 
Q: And did you do that? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. Was that in the morning of Mother's Day that you went over to the 
Browns? 
 
A: I guess, late morning. 
 
Q: Okay. And do you recall spending the entire day at the Browns that day? 
 
A: I didn't stay there that long. I left  after, I don't know, 45 minutes or so, came 
 I drove  back up to Los Angeles. 
 
Q: You were only at the Browns for about  45 minutes that day? 
 
A: I wasn't there that long. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you recall talking to Simpson t at all that day regarding his 
relationship with  Nicole? 
 
A: We had a conver-  he had a conversation. 
 
Q: One-sided? 
 
A: Just listen when O.J. talks. It's like you  he talks. 
 
Q: Okay. Could you tell me what he said  that day? 
 
A: Basically he said that it was over  between him and Nicole and that  
basically that was  it. 
 
And I said something to the effect, "Well, O.J., at least you know now that, you 
know, you  gave it, you know, your best. Hey, you know, now you two can get 
on with your lives." 
 
Q: Did he appear to be upset to you when he  was talking about it? 
 
A: No. We were just, you know, just  talking. 
 
Q: Did he tell you who had ended it between  them, whether it was he or 
Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Did he tell you when it had ended? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he tell you how it had ended? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he indicate to you that this was going to be a final breakup between he 
and Nicole? 
 
A: He said  I mean, you know, it's -- 
 
Q: He said what? 
 
A: He said it was over. I've heard that  before. 
 
Q: Prior to him telling you that at the  Browns, had Nicole said anything to you 
about it being over earlier that day when you saw her? 
 
A: No, Nicole wasn't talking. She didn't talk that much. We made a joke when 
he got back. It  was something -- I moved a barbecue cooker or whatever you 
call those things, and some ashes from it fell on the floor as I was taking it to the 
deck off the kitchen, and O.J. says something, "Nic, A.C.'s made a  mess." 
 
And I said, "Nic, nothing has changed."  Because when I used to move stuff, my 
hands, I'd be sweating, and sweat would get on the wall. I got mattresses, and 
he's sitting down or something like that; he'll say, "Nic, A.C. is messing up the 
wall," or something like that. 
 
So I said, "Nothing has changed," and Nic and I and O.J. just hugged because 
that remind us of other times. 
 
Then once she cleaned that up, we got in  the car and drove over to the Browns. 
Well, they got  in their car  yeah, I guess they drove together. I had my car. I 
met them over at the Browns. 
 
Q: Okay. After you got to Browns, did you  see Nicole leave at all while you 
were there? 
 
A: Not that I remember. 
 
Q: Okay. When was the next time you talked  to Simpson after that day at the 
Browns? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Do you recall when the next time you  talked to Nicole was after that day at 
the Browns? 
 
A: Don't remember. 
 
Q: Did you  did Simpson tell you that he had had a fight the night before with 
Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: He didn't tell you that it was over  because of a fight they had had the night 
before? 
 
A: He just said it was over. He said that, you know, that it just wasn't going on 
anymore. 
 
Q: And you indicated Nicole was very quiet  that morning? 
 
A: Yeah, she was quiet. 
 
Q: Okay. And she had been quiet in '79 when  she walked out of that bedroom 
after Simpson had thrown her clothes out the bedroom also, wasn't she? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object. Asked and answered  twice. 
 
THE WITNESS: Like that New Year's Day  I  mean, her and I had small talk. 
It wasn't like she wasn't talking. You know, her and I had small talk before O.J. 
got back, and she asked me what I did the  night before, and I said I was out to a 
few clubs  around the area, and I don't know if she said they  went out to dinner 
or went for drinks or whatever. I don't know, but  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Do you remember her saying they had been  out to Brios the night before? 
 
A: I don't know. I assume that they went  out. She didn't go into details. You 
know, it was just small talk, nothing that significant, you know,  in the 
conversation. 
 
Q: Were the kids there at that time? 
 
A: No, no, the kids wasn't there. 
 
Q: They definitely weren't there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know whether you spoke to  Nicole at all between that day and 
her birthday, which  would have been May 19th? 
 
A: I could have. She  you know, I would call her. If I wasn't, you know, by 
her house or  wasn't something at O.J.'s house for her or whatever  like what or 
somebody called and said, "We gonna have  something for Nicole," normally 
her and I  you know,  I would call her to wish her a happy birthday. Vice  
versa, on my birthday she'll call. So I don't know if  I did or not, to be honest 
with you. 
 
Q: Okay. Could you tell me when at all you  spoke to Nicole after May 8th and 
prior to her murder? 
 
A: I got a phone call one...  
 
Q: You can  yeah, go on. 
 
A: I probably was talking to her. There was  one time I remember. It was the 
day of the  earthquake. I was seeing after Marcus' house, seeing  what damages 
were done, and when I got home... 
 
Q:  I am asking you about May now. 
 
A: You asked me when I talked to her again. 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: You said from May until  
 
Q: And there was an earthquake in May of  '94? 
 
A: It wasn't an earthquake. I'm trying to  tell you when I saw her. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: When I got home there was a message from  Faye and a message from 
Nicole. Nicole was  wanted  me to come by. She was scared. The kids wasn't 
 the kids were in Laguna. So I drove by her place  
 
A: Her place at Bundy? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: And she was there, and she was saying how  frightened she was because, you 
know, the kids were  down in Laguna, and she didn't want to  she didn't want 
to ride on the freeways. She wanted to know if I  knew of a way of getting to 
Laguna without getting on  the freeways, and I said  
 
Q: Did you? 
 
A: No, not really. You could go the back  way of beach cities south, and 
eventually you got to  get back on, you know, on the freeway. 
 
So I took her as far as Hermosa Beach. She followed me. And I told her, I said 
 no. She was concerned about overpass. That's what she was  concerned 
about, on the freeways. So I took her as  far as I thought that  I took her to 
Hermosa Beach. 
 
Q: Wasn't the earthquake in January of 1994? 
 
A: I don't know when it was. Was that when  it was? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: 17th. January 17th. 
 
THE WITNESS: Okay. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. I am asking you for a time  
 
A: I'm getting all  well  
 
Q: Want to take a break for a minute? 
 
A: No. I'm fine.   
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: Then it was probably before then. Then I  don't remember talking to her, 
anything that sticks out. Maybe I had. Maybe I didn't. I really don't know. 
 
Q: Nothing between Mother's Day and the day  she was murdered? 
 
A: That could have been the time when I went  by that night and O.J. and her  
could have been that  time she was sick. 
 
Q: Did you go by there one night when  Simpson was there  
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q:  when she was sick? 
 
A: No, no, I don't know if she was sick or  not. I went by to see him and her 
because I hadn't seen either one of them in a long time, and I went by  and they 
were up in the bedroom. He was laying across the bed. The kids were on the bed 
with them, and Nic was  they were just one big, happy family. 
 
Q: And this was at Rockingham?   
 
A: No. This was on Bundy. 
 
Q: This was at Bundy?  And was this after Mother's Day? 
 
A: It could have been after Mother's Day. 
 
Q: Do you know whether it was before or  after her birthday? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Do you know whether she was still sick at that time or not? 
 
A: I don't know. She didn't appear  no.  She was up and about. 
 
Q: Okay. Were you aware that Mr. Simpson  had had a fund-raiser for Justin's 
school at his house  in May of that year? 
 
A: There was something going on. I went by there. I didn't know what it was, 
but I went by one  day and I saw a lot of kids, so I just assumed that it  was that 
time of the year when they would have this  event for Justy's Sunshine  
whatever the name of the  school is. They hosted that thing a couple times. 
 
Q: Was the night that you went by Bundy and saw Simpson over there with 
Nicole and the kids  did it happen to be that same night to the day they had  
had the fund-raiser? 
 
A: I don't know. I don't think so. I can't put them both together. I couldn't give 
you an honest  answer. 
 
Q: Okay. But to the best of your  recollection, you had seen them together once 
after  Mother's Day in May of 1994? 
 
A: That could have been after Mother's Day  or it could have been before 
Mother's Day. I can't give you -- 
 
Q: Oh, you're not certain about that, even? 
 
A: I couldn't give you, you know  it could  have been after. 
 
Q: Okay. But on Mother's Day, May 8th, 1994, Simpson had told you he and 
Nicole were  through. Correct? 
 
A: Yeah, he said it was over. 
 
Q: Okay. And to the best of your  recollection, you were over at Bundy at least 
once  after that and Simpson was over there up in the  bedroom with Nicole and 
the kids? 
 
A: Could have been. It could have been that  time. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know whether it was  could have been before or after May 
22nd? 
 
A: I couldn't give you that. No, I wouldn't  know. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever talk to Simpson about  an incident where Nicole returned 
a bracelet to him  that he had given her for her birthday? 
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Never? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever talk to Nicole about such an incident? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever talk to Simpson about an  incident where he had taken back 
diamond earrings he had given Nicole previously? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Nicole ever talk to you about an  incident like that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Could you tell me whether there came a  time in late May that you drove 
Sydney and Justin down  to Palm Springs to be with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: I did drive them down. I don't know  exactly  it was during  it would 
have had to be  during the season, the season of Palm Springs, so it had to have 
been before December, before the season's over. Palm Springs is seasonal for 
people who wants  to take advantage of the months there, because it gets  too 
hot during the summer months. 
 
Q: Do you recall what month that was you  drove Sydney and Justin down to 
Palm Springs? 
 
A: No, I couldn't give you a definite month. 
 
Q: Do you recall it being over the Memorial  Day weekend, the end of May, 
1994? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Asking him to speculate. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know for sure. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Could you tell me how long before  approximately how long before 
Nicole's murder was that  you drove the kids down to Palm Springs? 
 
A: I couldn't tell you. 
 
Q: Do you recall seeing Simpson down in Palm Springs? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you recall who, if anybody, was with  him at that time? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Who was? 
 
A: Marcus and Katherine and Paula. 
 
Q: Okay. And do you recall seeing anybody  else down there with them? 
 
A: It was a golf tournament, I think.  
 
Q: See Allen Austin down there?  
 
A: No, I don't remember if I saw Allen or not. 
 
Q: Did you stay overnight down there? 
 
A: No, I came back. 
 
Q: Did you leave the children there? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you pick them up then and bring them home also? 
 
A: No. They came back with O.J., I guess. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever talk to Simpson after that day and before Nicole's 
murder, at all? 
 
A: After that Palm Springs trip?   
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Did he ever tell you about having any  sort of fight with Paula that weekend 
he was in  Palm Springs? 
 
A: Not that I remember. 
 
Q: Okay. Could you tell me the last time prior to Nicole's murder you talked to 
Simpson? 
 
A: The one time that stands out in my mind was I was back East the week of  
that week before the 12th. I was scheduled to come back on a Wednesday. I 
think I talked to O.J. on a Tuesday. I  said, "Hey, man." I had called him 
because I hadn't  spoken with him. 
 
And he said, "I'm coming back to  New York. " 
 
And I said, "When?" I said, "I'm back  here now." 
 
THE REPORTER: I'm sorry. I'm losing who is  saying these. Could you -- 
 
THE WITNESS: I'm in New York. I called O.J., and he didn't  I don't know if 
he knew I was in  New York. Anyway, he said he was coming to New York.  I 
said, "Well, I'm here now, but I gotta come back." 
 
He says, "I gotta come in and I gotta be here for a couple days, and I gotta get 
back to the  West Coast because of some event for Sydney." 
 
So I said, "Well, if you coming back, why don't we have dinner either Friday or 
Saturday?" 
 
He said, "Okay." He says, "Let's make  sure we talk when we get back" 
"when I get back  Friday." 
 
So I said "Okay," but him and I never  made contact.

EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Mr. Cowlings, my name is Daniel  Petrocelli. I represent Fredric Goldman. 
You have asserted the Fifth Amendment privilege against  self-incrimination a 
number of times throughout this deposition. I would like to ask you some 
questions about that. 
 
Were you aware that your lawyer, Mr. Re,  made comments to the press to the 
effect that you  wanted to talk, you wanted to tell your story? Are you aware of 
that? 
 
MR. RE: Are you asking if he's aware whether  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
MR. RE:  I made comments? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
Q: Are you aware that your lawyer made  comments on your behalf that you 
wanted to testify fully and completely and wanted to tell the complete story that 
you have? 
 
MR. RE: You talking about with the grant of immunity? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Are you aware of that? 
 
A: With the grant of immunity? 
 
Q: Whatever. That you wanted to be able to  tell your story. Yeah, if you had 
immunity, you would  talk. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And is that true? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. What have you done to get immunity? 
 
MR. RE: Well, wait a second. He has no obligation to get immunity, he cannot 
get immunity, and under Kauffman and Daly you are the one who can get  him 
immunity. So there is nothing that he can do in  any event.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Well, the question is: Have you done  anything, have you taken any effort, 
made any effort  to obtain permission from the D.A.'s office or go to court, seek 
relief, or do anything to enable you to  come here in this case and give full and 
complete  testimony? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object  
 
MR. RE: There is no procedure for him to do  that. That's an improper question. 
I direct him not  to answer it. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Have you instructed your lawyer to take  such actions on your behalf? 
 
MR. RE: He is not a lawyer. He can't instruct  me what to do under the law. It's 
an improper  question. There is nothing that can be done in that  regard, and it's 
totally improper. I direct him.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Have you had any discussions with anybody  about whether or not you 
would testify fully and  completely in this deposition in this lawsuit, other  than 
counsel? 
 
A: No. Just with my counsel. 
 
Q: Okay. You understand that the Fifth  Amendment is a right that belongs to 
you and not to your lawyer. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And it's your choice whether or not to  exercise it. You understand that. 
Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you can choose not to exercise it and  testify fully and answer all the 
questions. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you have chosen not to do so. Right? 
 
A: Under the advice of my attorney. 
 
Q: Do you believe you have something to  hide? 
 
MR. RE: That's an improper question. 
 
MR. LEONARD: And I object. 
 
MR. RE: It's completely improper. I direct  him not to answer that kind of 
question. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Do you have something to hide, sir? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation  
 
MR. RE: Again, that's a totally improper question. Anyone who implies  
 
MR. LEONARD: Argumentative. 
 
MR. RE: Anyone who implies that there is  something wrong with asserting the 
Fifth Amendment is doing it for grandstanding and grandstanding only, because 
there is nothing wrong with that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Are you directing him not to answer? 
 
MR. RE: Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
Q: Where do you work, Mr. Cowlings? 
 
A: I work for Jonathan Martin Dress Company. 
 
Q: What exactly do you do there?   
 
A: Production and sales. 
 
Q: And how long have you been there? 
 
A: Over five years now, I would think.   
 
Q: Have you been working there full time for  the last five years? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And normally you work what, 40 hours a  week? 
 
A: Give or take more. 
 
Q: Okay. And have you taken any significant  breaks from your employment in 
the last five years since you've been there?

 people I work for have been very supportive.

A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And you've been compensated anyway, even  though you've taken the time 
off? 
 
A: I get paid. Yes, I get my regular salary. 
 
Q: There hasn't been any reduction in your compensation. Is that right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And you said you're in production?

every once in  a while. 
 
Q: Okay. When is the last time you spoke to  her? 
 
A: Actually, she called me last week. 
 
Q: How often do you talk to her? 
 
A: She's an entertainer, she's on the road a lot, and she was on tour with the 
Rolling Stones for a couple years, I guess, this last tour they had. 
 
Q: In 1994 did you talk to her at all? 
 
A: I could have. I don't remember. 
 
Q: What about in June of 1994? 
 
A: I could have. And most of the time when I go to New York, I may call her to 
see if she's in  town or something. I don't know if I did or not. 
 
Q: Do you recall speaking with her at any  time in the middle of June of 1994? 
 
A: She called after all this had happened to  wish me, you know, good will. 
 
Q: She called during the week of June 13th?

calls, and I was returning phone calls to the people that I knew.  
 
Q: Who else did you talk to in New York City that week? 
 
MR. RE: Wait a second. Which week are you  talking about? 
 
THE WITNESS: Which week? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: June 13th.   
 
MR. RE: Assert the privilege. 
 
THE WITNESS: I wasn't in New York.   
 
MR. RE: No, no. He said, "Who else did you talk to in New York..." I am 
asking you to assert a  privilege to it.   
 
THE WITNESS: Oh, privilege. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Do you know Bobby Bender?   
 
A: Yes, I do. 
 
Q: Is he a good friend of yours?   
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And he lives in Long Island? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you talk to him that week? 
 
MR. RE:  Same thing. Assert the privilege. 
 
THE WITNESS: Privilege.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Okay. Have you been in contact with him since June 17, 1994 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: On a regular basis?   
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And you've spoken to him about  Mr. Simpson's case, haven't you? 
  
A: We have spoken about the situation. 
 
Q: And you spoke to Mr. Bender about the  fact that Mr. Simpson stayed with 
him a couple days before the murder. Right? 
 
A: I don't know for sure. I know I stayed here when I was there that week. 
 
Q: When you were in New York the week that  I guess it would be June 5  
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q:  or June  let me see  yeah, the week of June 5, June 5 being a Sunday, 
you were there  what days that week in New York? 
 
A: I was there the week before  I was  there before that  before the weekend 
all that happened, I was in New York.  I came in the week -- yeah, I guess. 
 
Q: The murders occurred on June 12th  
 
A: 12th. 
 
Q: -- on a Sunday. 
 
A: I came in I think on  like on a  Thursday or a Friday. Yeah, I guess that 
date that you earlier  
 
Q: June 9 or June 10 is when you came back from Long Island, New York? 
 
A: Yeah, I came back on a Wednesday. 
 
Q: Wednesday? So that would be June 8? 
 
A: Yeah, I think so. 
 
Q: And when did you go to New York that week? 
 
A: The week  I think I came in like the following week. Could have been a 
Wednesday or a  Thursday. 
 
Q: And the entire time you were there you  stayed with Bobby Bender? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And, now, you said you had a  telephone call with Mr. Simpson I 
believe on Tuesday  when you were in New York and he was in Los Angeles.  
Is that right? 
 
A: Yes, I think  no. The phone call  no, I take that back. The phone call 
came into  Bob Bender's house, and Bobby and I were there.  O.J.   
 
Q: I see. 
 
A: O.J. had called from his carphone.   
 
Q: And called Bender and you at Bender's  house? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Okay. And then you told Mr. Simpson you  were going back to L A., and he 
was coming out to Bender's, actually. Right? 
 
A: Yes, he was coming in to New York. I  didn't know if he was going to stay 
there. He was  coming into New York.   
 
Q: Okay. Now, you've spoken to Bender about  Simpson's stay with him those 
couple of days that  week, didn't you? 
 
A: No, I don't remember talking to him about it. 
 
Q: Isn't it true that Mr. Bender described to you what O.J. Simpson was like 
during those couple of days at his house? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: You don't have any recollection of  that  
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  of ever having spoken with Mr. Bender  about Mr. Simpson's behavior 
and his demeanor during  those few days? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you have any conversation  with Paula Barbieri in the month of 
June prior to June 12th? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: None at all? 
 
A: There was one  I stopped by O.J.'s one night to get a ball autographed, and 
Paula was there,  Paula, Arnelle, O.J. When that happened, I don't know. It 
would have been before June. 
 
Q: Before you took your trip to Bender's in June? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And was it your understanding when you  saw Mr. Simpson there with Paula 
Barbieri that he had  resumed his relationship with her? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation.  Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I really don't know. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did you know anything about his  relationship with Paula at that time? 
 
A: I know they had been seeing each other. 
 
Q: When was the first time you saw or  learned that he had been seeing her 
again? 
 
A: I never thought too much of it, to be  honest with you. 
 
Q: In fact you never understood that he ever  broke up with her. Right? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I really don't know, sir.  It's  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: In other words, from the first time he  met Paula Barbieri and started to date 
her, you never understood that he broke up with her for an extended period of 
time. True? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. I wasn't around  them. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And you never became aware of a time in  his relationship with Miss 
Barbieri where he stopped seeing her for an extended period of time. True? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I have no knowledge of that. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Well, that's what I'm saying. You don't have any knowledge that he ever 
stopped seeing her for a lengthy period of time. Correct? 
 
A: I don't know. I don't know. I couldn't  answer that. I wasn't around a lot, so I 
couldn't  tell you what status the y were. 
 
Q: Well, you know he was seeing  Miss Barbieri during his divorce with Nicole, 
right,  back in 1992 when he first met her? 
 
A: Yeah, he was seeing  they were dating.

period of time? 
 
A: I wasn't around there a lot. 
 
Q: Okay. How many times have you seen her total in your life before the 
murders? 
 
A: Before the murders? I could probably count it on one hand. 
 
Q: Just about four or five times? 
 
A: If that much. I really didn't see a lot  of Paula and O.J. because I wasn't 
coming around that much. 
 
Q: Okay. So let me make sure we're clear on this. As you sit here today, prior to 
the murders  I am only referring to prior to the murders on  June 12  you 
have no knowledge or information about the status of his relationship with Paula 
Barbieri,  when it was on, when it was off, and so forth? 
 
A: No. No, I don't.   
 
Q: Is that correct?   
 
A: That's correct.   
 
Q: Okay. Do you have any financial  involvement with Mr. Simpson?

Q: When was the last time? 
 
A: He had called me  that's when he was  involved with Swiss Army knives 
 and he said he  he put my name down as something pertaining to a deal  
that he was involved in. And he said he couldn't go  into details at this point in 
time, but, you know, he  let me know that he was thinking of me, and once it  
was finalized or everything was put in it's proper  place, he would be able to 
explain to me a little more  detail what it was about.

Q: Who were they? 
 
A: One was  I don't know  one was  they were brothers, and one was 
named Alan and I  forgot the other one's name. So we didn't see eye to  eye, so I 
left. 
 
Q: What years did you operate Fellini's? 
 
A: I was only there for about three months,  three or four months. 
 
Q: And what year was that? 
 
A: I wouldn't know. 
 
Q: In the '80s? 
 
A: That was in  yeah, probably in the late '80s, I think. 
 
Q: And after Fellini's, what did you do professionally? 
 
A: What did I do. I think I did commercial work. I did a  trying to think, 
figure out when would this fall in. I was the Kool man, Kool cigarettes print ad, 
black model for Kool for two  years. They had a cigarette campaign.  I did 
billboards, print ads, and I did that for about two years, off and on. 
 
Q: After Fellini's?

before. I  really couldn't tell you.

you the exact date. 
 
Q: What year was it? 
 
A: Probably would have been '93. '93? 
 
Q: Did you have a best man? 
 
A: No, uh-uh. We went to Vegas and got  married. 
 
Q: Okay. Does Mr. Simpson know Marion? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How long did they know each other? 
 
A: Her and I went together for about a year  almost. He met her, been out with

A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Marion? 
 
A: I'm sorry. Yes. 
 
Q: And you went out as couples?   
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. How many times did you think that  Nicole and Marion had come into 
contact with each  other? 
 
A: Went by the house once, went to dinner with O.J. and Nicole and two other 
couples. Could  have been two or three times. 
 
Q: Did you and Marion separate before or  after Nicole's death? 
 
A: We just thought that it would have been  best because I wanted to keep her 
out of all this craziness, so I just tried to keep some sanity, you  know, with us. 
It was  just before it happened we kinda like  we were having some 
problems. Then after it happened I just told her, you know, just, you know, be 
best that we just, you know, try to maintain some privacy. 
 
Q: Did she move out of the home you were living in, or did you move out of the 
home? 
 
A: I moved out. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you move out of that home  before or after Nicole's death?   
 
A: Before. 
 
Q: How long before?   
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Days? Weeks? Months? 
 
A: No, it was sometime before. I don't know  when, but I did. 
 
Q: Okay. And what was the address where you  were living in June  on June 
12, 1994? 
 
A: It was on Centinela. 
 
Q: On June 12 of 1994? 
 
A: Oh, June 12th? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: I was up in the Palisades. 
 
Q: And Marion and you were living on  Centinela? 
 
A: Before then, yes. 
 
Q: You moved out and moved to the Palisades? 
 
A: Yes. I still had my apartment in Santa Monica. 
 
Q: Where does the Santa Monica apartment fit in? I'm a little confused. 
Centinela? 
 
A: No. On San Vicente. 
 
Q: Okay. Let me get this straight. You still had a place on San Vicente in Santa 
Monica while you were living with your wife  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  on Centinela? Is that what you re saying? 
 
A: No. Her and I lived on Centinela, but I still had my apartment on San 
Vicente, 7th and  San Vicente. 
 
Q: And it was vacant? 
 
A: Yeah, there was nobody there. 
 
Q: And then you moved into it? 
 
A: When her and I split up, I went back.  Then when the earthquake hit and 
damaged my apartment, I moved up to the Palisades. 
 
Q: Okay. And that's where you were living on June 12, 1994? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Are you still living there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And when did you leave that apartment? 
 
A: Sometime after all the craziness  happened. Could have been a few months 
afterwards. 
 
Q: What was the address of that apartment? 
 
A: Which one? 
 
Q: The one on June 12, 1994, the one where  you were living  
 
A: Up in the Palisades? 
 
Q:  on June 12th. Yeah.   
 
A: It was a house. 
 
Q: Did you own the house? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you rent it? 
 
A: Yes, I rented part of the house. 
 
Q: And were you living there with someone? 
 
A: The owner of the house lived in the other part of the house. 
 
Q: What is the name of the owner of the house? 
 
A: (name deleted). 
 
Q: How do you spell the last name?   
 
A: Is it (name deleted)? 
 
Q: Does (name deleted) still live there?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR.PETROCELLI: Okay. We will have to break now. I was hoping that we 
could commence again on Monday. Mr. Leonard informs me he is not available 
on  Monday, so I guess we are going to have to schedule this at the next best 
date for everyone. 
 
MR. RE: Tuesday? 
 
MR. LEONARD: I won't be available next week. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, I just want to say on  the record that I would like to 
get this done as soon  as possible. 
 
MR. LEONARD: That's fine. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: And perhaps you can rearrange  your schedule to make 
yourself available sometime next week? 
 
MR. LEONARD: No, I won't be able to be available next week. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Well, when can you make  yourself available? 
 
MR. LEONARD: The week after. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: On Monday, May 6? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Let me get back to you. I'm  going over  
 
MR. RE: I'll be in trial that week. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Well, because of all the objections on the record, I 
just think it's  important that we get this transcript completed as soon as 
possible. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Why don't we keep going now? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Because I have to stop at  4:30, and I can't finish in a half 
an hour, anyway. 
 
MR. LEONARD: How about tomorrow? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: And I asked Mr. Re and he is  not available tomorrow, 
although I'm willing to come  in tomorrow to do this. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Well, I am, too, so... 
 
MR. KELLY: I am. 
 
MR. RE: I'm not. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. So  
 
MR. LEONARD: All right. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. So I guess we will have  to adjourn at this point.

EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Have you ever testified under oath before? 
 
A: Yes, I have. 
 
Q: On how many occasions? 
 
A: Once. 
 
Q: When was that? 
 
A: At the trial for Mr. Simpson. 
 
Q: That was the first time you ever testified under oath? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Are you under any medication?  
 
A: No, I'm not. 
 
Q: What is your occupation? 
 
A: I'm a doctor of chiropractic. 
 
Q: How long have you been a chiropractor? 
 
A: I graduated in 1983. 
 
Q: And began practicing --  
 
A: In 1983. 
 
Q: Here in Los Angeles? 
 
A: Started practicing in Illinois for one year and then moved to Los 
Angeles in 1984.  I have been practicing since then. 
 
Q: How old are you?  
 
A: I'm 36. 
 
Q: What is your educational background? 
 
A: Starting from kindergarten? 
 
Q: No.  After high school. 
 
A: After high school I went to College of Du Page, which is a junior 
college in Illinois, and then went to chiropractic college also in 
Illinois. 
 
Q: When did you -- what degree did you get from undergraduate 
school? 
 
A: Was a pre-med course, so no degree, but then a bachelor of 
science at the National College of Chiropractic and then a doctorate 
degree in chiropractic from also the National College of 
Chiropractic. 
 
Q: What year was that? 
 
A: 1983. 
 
Q: Where have you practiced in Los Angeles since 1984 to the 
present? 
 
A: Started in Malibu and still practice in Malibu, and I have an office 
there as well as an office in Santa Monica. 
 
Q: When did you acquire the Santa Monica office? 
 
A: In 1991. 
 
Q: In 1994, prior to the death of Nicole Brown Simpson, you had a 
Malibu office and a Santa Monica office? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: How many employees did you have at that time? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Are we talking about 1994, Dan? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: At that time, correct. 
 
THE WITNESS: In both offices combined? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: I'd say five in -- altogether, both offices. 
 
Q: And can you name them for me, please? 
 
A: [Names Deleted.] 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: Pam. I don't even recall her last name right now. And billing lady 
that came in one day a week.  I don't recall her name either. 
 
Q: Are these individuals still under your employment? 
 
A: Only [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: But they were all employed by you as of June 12, 1994.  Correct? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Was Faye Resnick also employed by you in 1994? 
 
A: She came in and did some office work. 
 
Q: Did you pay her? 
 
A: I paid her, yeah.  She was working there at the office for a period 
of about six weeks. 
 
Q: In l994? 
 
A: In 1994.  And basically performed very poorly and was 
consequently let go. 
 
Q: You fired her? 
 
A: I asked her to not come back into the office. 
 
Q: You fired her.  Correct? 
 
A: Well, how is it when you have a relationship with somebody that 
works in the office and it doesn't work out?  Do you fire them? Do 
you ask them to not come back? What's the legal terminology?  I 
don't know. 
 
Q: But in your opinion, you fired her. 
 
A: I let her go. 
 
Q: Okay.  When was that? 
 
A: That was just before March 18th. 
 
Q: Why does that date stick out in your mind? 
 
A: Because that's when she had her surgery.  And she had just started 
working right after the earthquake, which was January 17th. 
 
Q: Between January 17, 1994 and March 18, 1994, how regularly did 
Ms. Resnick work for you? 
 
A: Was she supposed to or did she actually? 
 
Q: Actually. 
 
A: Probably two half days a week.  And there were times when she'd 
just basically pop in and out of the office.  So combined, probably 
two half days a week. 
 
Q: Was one of the reasons that you asked her to help you out was 
because of the earthquake and the dislocation caused by the 
earthquake? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: How much did you pay her? 
 
A: I paid her $500 for each two week pay period. 
 
Q: From approximately January 17 through March 18, 1994.  Right? 
 
A: Yeah. Or shortly before the 18th, something like that. 
 
Q: Now, I asked you pursuant to a subpoena to bring with you a 
variety of documents and other materials.  I am going to attach this 
as the next exhibit in order.  I will make copies of it at a break.  I am 
going to put Exhibit 166 up here just so we don't forget.  (Plaintiffs' 
Exhibit 166 was marked for identification by the reporter and is 
attached hereto.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I hand you Exhibit 166, Mr. Reichardt.  Have you seen that 
before? 
 
A: Yes, I have. 
 
Q: And have you done anything to respond to it? 
 
A: Yes, I have. 
 
Q: What have you done? 
 
A: I called the phone company to get the phone records and was told 
that the phone records would have to be subpoenaed by the 
attorneys. 
 
Q: If we subpoenaed those records, you will consent to our obtaining 
them? 
 
A: Absolutely, yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: And I've brought my day-timer from that time period. 
 
Q: What did you do to locate records other than call the phone 
company? 
 
A: The only records -- other records that I would have from that 
period of time that was requested is in my desk right where the other 
daytimers are. I just pulled it out. 
 
Q: In your office? 
 
A: No.  At my home. 
 
Q: At your home?  You have a desk at your home? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What is your home address? 
 
A: [Address Deleted]. 
 
Q: Was that your home address in June of 1994? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: How long have you been living there? 
 
A: Since 1987. 
 
Q: Did you ever take any photographs of O.J. Simpson or Nicole 
Brown Simpson or -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: --videotapes?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever get any? 
 
A: I -- when Faye and I used to live together, yes, we did.  We used 
to have some photographs that disappeared as Faye disappeared to 
write a book.  
 
Q: You're saying that the photographs used to be at your place on 
Montana but no longer are there? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And currently you have possession of no photographs? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Tape recordings?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Anything? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Is that correct?  
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Do you have canceled checks going back to early 1994? 
 
A: The bank would have them, most likely. 
 
Q: You have bank statements?  
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Do you have any records indicating the receipt of money from 
O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: Yeah, I probably would have that. 
 
Q: What would those records be? 
 
A: Probably a deposit slip or a deposit showing up on my bank 
statement. 
 
Q: Do you have copies of those statements at home? 
 
A: No, I don't have them at home. 
 
Q: You can request them from the bank? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And what bank is that? 
 
A: Bank of America at the Brentwood branch. 
 
Q: And will you do so?  
 
A: I could do that. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: Yeah.  
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Just for the record, if there are requests that 
will be made, if you could make those to us afterwards at your 
convenience in writing or any way you'd like, we can -- you can 
address a letter to me itemizing what you'd like, and we will 
endeavor to comply with all your requests. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you. 
 
Q: What I would like is all bank records and other documents that 
would indicate any financia1 dealings or transactions between you 
and O.J. Simpson or any of his entities or any of his representatives. 
 
A: That would be very simple. 
 
Q: Okay.  Have you ever been interviewed by any member of the 
media in connection with the death of Nicole Brown? 
 
A: One time, yes. 
 
Q. Who was that? 
 
A: Barbara Walters. 
 
Q: You gave a filmed interview to Barbara Walters? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: When was that? 
 
A: I believe it was in October '94. 
 
Q: Have you spoken to newspaper writers, magazine writers, 
authors, anyone? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You know there have been a number of books written about O.J. 
Simpson and the death of Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown.  
Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Has anyone ever contacted you regarding those books? 
 
A: Oh. everybody -- lots of people have contacted me about it. 
 
Q: And you have declined to comment? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Without exception?  
 
A: Yeah. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Well, may I have a moment? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
THE WITNESS: Everybody got routed towards Dominick's office. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And Dominick Rubalcava is your attorney.  Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How long has Mr. Rubalcava been your attorney? 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Go ahead and answer that.  '87? 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  
 
Q: So since the death of Nicole Brown Simpson, Mr. Rubalcava has 
been your attorney?  
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And he has been advising you in connection with inquiries made 
regarding your knowledge of the facts and circumstances of Nicole's 
death? 
 
A: Can you repeat that? 
 
(Pending question read.) 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes.  Yes. 
 
(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the 
hearing of the reporter.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You have had a chance to confer with your attorney? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Would you like to amplify your answer? 
 
A: Right. Amplify the answer as to interviews concerning the case, it 
was basically on the way out of the courthouse, stopped and 
answered some questions from reporters right outside the 
courthouse, but that was the only other incident. 
 
Q: In connection with the trial testimony that you gave? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you gave that testimony on behalf of O.J. Simpson.  Correct? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: A subpoena by the court. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You were asked to testify by O.J. Simpson's lawyers. Correct? 
 
A: I was asked to testify by the court. 
 
Q: What do you mean, "the court"?  Judge Ito called you up? 
 
A: Well, I got subpoenas from different attorneys' offices. 
 
Q: Who served the subpoena on you? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
MR RUBALCAVA: It was Mr. Cochran's office. 
 
THE WITNESS: Mr. Cochran's office.  So perhaps I'm not 
understanding your question. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You understood that Johnnie Cochran was O.J. Simpson's lawyer.  
Right? 
 
A: I understand that. 
 
Q: And you understood that Johnnie Cochran was asking you to 
come to court to testify. Correct? 
 
A: That's correct.  Phrase it like that, then I understand the question. 
 
Q: Okay.  And before you testified at Mr. Johnnie Cochran's request, 
did you meet with him? 
 
A: I had dinner with him. 
 
Q: Was that dinner the one and only time you had ever met with any 
lawyer or representative of O.J. Simpson in connection with the 
criminal proceedings? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: So you never spoke to Robert Kardashian, for example? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And to this day have never spoken to him.  Correct? 
 
A: I've spoken to him as a friend, but not in connection with the case. 
 
Q: Have you ever spoken to Robert Shapiro? 
 
A: Only at the court. 
 
Q: At the court? 
 
A: While I was at the court.  And I ran into him in a restaurant 
several months ago. 
 
Q: Have you ever spoken to F. Lee Bailey? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or any -- 
 
A: Just at the court again. 
 
Q: You spoke to Mr. Shapiro and Mr. Bailey at court in a meeting? 
 
A: No. Just as, "Hello. How are you?  Nice to meet you." 
 
Q: In the case of both of those lawyers, that's all you said? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And again, the court appearance you're referring to is the trial? 
 
A: That's right. 
 
Q: Did you testify at the preliminary hearing? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or at any of the Grand Jury proceedings? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Other than the Johnnie Cochran dinner, which we'll get to, were 
you ever interviewed by any member of Mr. Simpson's staff, 
including investigators. where they took a statement and asked you 
what you knew? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And tape-recorded it? 
 
A: No.  I met with Mr. Pavelick once, but it was over coffee an also 
was not a formal setting, a statement or tape recording. 
 
Q: Who is Pavelick? 
 
A: Bill Pavelick is one of the investigators for Mr. Simpson's team. 
 
Q: When you met Mr. Pavelick for coffee, is that the first time you 
had ever met him? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And is that the only time you had ever met him? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Have you ever spoken to A.C. Cowlings? 
 
A: Ever in -- 
 
Q: Ever. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Is he a friend of yours? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever speak to Mr. Cowlings regarding anything having to 
do with Mr. Simpson's predicament? 
 
A: Not really. 
 
Q: Are you unsure of yourself? You said, "Not really." 
 
A: No.  I met A.C. a couple times at the -- at O.J.'s house, and we just 
exchanged some words, friendly words, and that's it. 
 
Q: Before Mr. Simpson's incarceration or after? 
 
A: After. 
 
Q: Before Mr. Simpson -- before Nicole's death, had you ever met 
A.C. Cowlings? 
 
A: I met him once briefly, very briefly, couple minutes. 
 
Q: During the entire time -- Withdrawn.  From, June 12, 1994 until 
the day that Mr. Simpson was released from jail in October of 1995, 
did you ever have a conversation with A.C. Cowlings? 
 
A: No, I did not have a conversation with him.  I left him a message 
at his machine. 
 
Q: When was that? 
 
A: That must have been approximately two weeks, two and a half 
weeks after the murders. 
 
Q: And what was your message? 
 
Q: The message was that A.C. had called the house -- 
 
Q: Whose house? 
 
A: My house. -- and talked to Faye, and Faye was acting rather 
sporadic and slammed the phone down, and I called -- I asked Faye 
for A.C.'s phone number, and I left a message back at A.C.'s machine 
saying that Faye's not feeling well at this time and that when Faye's 
feeling better, that we would sit down with him and talk. 
 
Q: Were you present when Faye was talking to A.C. Cowlings? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: The entire time? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: How long did that conversation last? 
 
A: A minute. 
 
Q: And why did you feel it was necessary to contact Mr. Cowlings? 
 
A: Because when he called, Faye put it on the speakerphone, and he 
inquired how Faye was feeling and was very friendly and polite, and 
he said he would love to sit down with her sometime and just talk, 
and Faye started screaming at him on the speakerphone and basically 
said, "Leave me alone.  I don't want to have anything to do with 
anybody," and slammed down the phone.  And I thought it was 
rather strange in how she was reacting, because he just wanted to sit 
down and talk, so I called him back and I said, "Look, you know, 
she's not feeling well." 
 
Q: This was about a week or so after --  
 
A: No.  It was -- 
 
Q: -- the murder? 
 
A: It was after Faye came out of rehab and was doing only the day 
care at the rehab center.  So she was staying at home at night, at the 
house at night. 
 
Q: Again, this was a week or so after the murders? 
 
A: Must have been two weeks. 
 
Q: Two weeks? 
 
A: Two weeks, two and a half weeks, somewhere in there. 
 
Q: And you knew, of course, that A.C. Cowlings at the time of that 
telephone call to Faye Resnick was a friend of O.J. Simpson's. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you had briefly met him before.  Correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Prior to this occasion when A.C. Cowlings called Faye Resnick to 
talk, how many times had A.C. Cowlings called you on the phone? 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: How many times had A.C. Cowlings called Faye Resnick on the 
phone? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: In your presence. 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: How many times had Faye Resnick informed you that she 
received a telephone call from A.C. Cowlings? 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: It was clear to you, was it not, that A.C. Cowlings was calling 
Faye Resnick to talk about O.J. Simpson.  Correct? 
 
A: Or about the murders or -- yeah. 
 
Q: And you thought it was inappropriate for Faye Resnick not to 
speak to him.  Correct? 
 
A: No. I thought it was inappropriate the way she reacted. 
 
Q: You wanted Faye to talk to him.  Correct? 
 
A: That's not -- was not up to me.  It's up to Faye to decide whether 
she wants to talk to him.  I thought it was inappropriate how she 
screamed at him. 
 
Q: You asked Faye to talk to A.C. Cowlings.  Right? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object as leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: I said, "Why wouldn't you want to talk to him?"  
It's up to Faye to decide whether she wants to talk to him, not me. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You said, "Why wouldn't you want to talk to him?"  True? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: What did she say? 
 
A: She screamed.  She just flipped out and ran downstairs. 
 
Q: She had just lost her dearest friend.  Correct? 
 
A: Yeah, well, she was just going through drug rehab. 
 
Q: You can talk about drugs when we get to drugs. I am not really 
focused on drugs right now.  Okay? You will get a chance to talk 
about drugs.  What was my question? 
 
(Pending question read.)  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Nicole Brown was a dear friend of Faye Resnick.  Right? 
 
A: That's right. 
 
Q: You don't deny that, do you?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And Faye Resnick was very upset over Nicole's murder.  Correct? 
 
A: Well, that's where I'm trying to let you know. If somebody goes to 
drug rehabilitation, everything gets amplified significantly. So I 
think it's very difficult to differentiate right now why she reacted like 
that. Was it because she lost a friend or she was going through drug 
rehabilitation. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I move to strike the answer as nonresponsive. 
 
Q: I would like you to answer my question. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Maybe 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me. 
 
Q: Maybe Mr. Leonard can ask you those kinds of questions.  Can 
we get back to my question, please. 
 
MR. LEONARD: No, there is no reason for that kind of a comment, 
Mr. Petrocelli. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Leonard, if you want to examine your 
witness at the appropriate time, you may do so.  I am examining this 
witness, and I am not getting answers to my questions, and I am 
going to press for answers. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I think he is answering your questions. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: So what do you want me to do?  Agree with 
you and move on? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Why don't you ask another question. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You want to take the deposition? 
 
MR. LEONARD: It's your deposition. Go ahead. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Exactly. It is my deposition. That's my point.  
Can you go back to my question, please. 
 
(Pending question read as follows:  "Q. And Faye Resnick was very 
upset over Nicole's murder. Correct?") 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't think that's a question I can answer with yes 
or no because I don't know Faye's state of mind at the time. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Do you think it's -- that Faye had a kind of relationship with 
Nicole Brown -- 
 
A: Yes, she did. Excuse me. 
 
Q: -- that when her friend was murdered; that she would have been 
upset about it? 
 
A: Yes 
 
Q: Now were you on drugs at that tune? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Were you upset? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Over Nicole's murder? 
 
A: Absolutely. 
 
Q: Were you grief-stricken over it?  
 
A: Absolutely. 
 
Q: Did Faye have a closer relationship with Nicole than you did? 
 
A: Absolutely. 
 
Q: So is it fair to say that she was grief-stricken? 
 
A: Absolutely. 
 
Q: More than you?  
 
A: Absolutely. 
 
Q: Irrespective of drugs. Correct? 
 
A: Excuse me? 
 
Q: Irrespective of drugs. Correct?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Thank you. That's all I want to know. 
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q: In fact, you felt so strong about her talking to Mr. Cowlings that 
you called Mr. Cowlings.  Correct? 
 
MR. LEONARD: I am objecting to the leading. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: True? 
 
A: I felt she acted not very respectful to him, so out of respect for all 
the people involved, because I know A.C. was grieving, I called him 
back and said, "Look, at some later time we'll talk to you." 
 
Q: Is it your testimony that you called A.C. Cowlings back to 
apologize for Faye and nothing more? 
 
A: Basically, yeah. 
 
Q: And you didn't mention anything about, "We'll get together and 
talk at some other time"? 
 
A: Yeah, that's what I said: "We'll call when she feels better." 
 
Q: "We'll call." Who is the "we"? 
 
A: We'll call. You know, we'll call. 
 
Q: You and Faye Resnick? 
 
A: Faye, yeah. 
 
Q: How many times -- 
 
A: Faye, A.C, and I and -- 
 
Q: Excuse me.  How many times had you called A.C. Cowlings up 
before -- 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: -- this event? 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: This was the first time? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: How did you get his phone number? 
 
A: Faye had it. 
 
Q: After that telephone call --Withdrawn.  What else did you say in 
your message to A.C. Cowlings -- 
 
A: That was it. 
 
Q: -- other than, "We'll get together and talk"? 
 
A: That was it.  When Faye feels better. 
 
Q: And did you ever get together and talk? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
A: Because there was no need.  Faye didn't want to, so there was no 
need to do it. 
 
Q: And Faye told you she didn't want to.  Correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Faye believed O.J. Simpson killed Nicole, didn't she? 
 
A: That's what she said, yeah. 
 
Q: She told that to you immediately when you first talked to her 
following Nicole's death. True? 
 
A: That's right. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the leading. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: True? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
(Peter Gelblum enters the deposition.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And Faye Resnick obviously knew that A.C. Cowlings was a 
very, very close friend of O.J. Simpson. Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: In fact, Mr. Simpson's closest friend.  True? 
 
A: I don't know whether she knew that or believed that.  I think she 
knew that they were very close. 
 
Q: Have you spoken to any other members of Mr. Simpson's 
entourage? 
 
A: I talked to Dan briefly on Wednesday evening. 
 
Q: And by "Dan," you are not referring to me, of course. You're 
referring to Dan Leonard. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Attorney for O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And why don't you tell me about your conversation with Dan. 
 
A: We briefly talked on Wednesday evening just about procedures of 
today, that we will be here in the morning. 
 
Q: Procedures of today.  Correct? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Meaning today's deposition.  Right? 
 
A: Today's deposition. 
 
Q: And, of course, you have a lawyer: Mr. Rubalcava.  Right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And without getting into the substance of your conversations, 
you've spoken to your lawyer about today's proceedings. Right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Did you call Dan? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Dan called you? 
 
A: No. I talked to Dan at Mr. Simpson's house. 
 
Q: By the way, you've never met me, have you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You've never spoken to me before.  Right? 
 
A: No, I haven't. 
 
Q: And you haven't spoken to any lawyer for Fred Goldman.  
Correct? 
 
A: No, I haven't. 
 
Q: And you haven't met Mr. Brewer before, either. Right? 
 
A: No, I haven't. 
 
Q: Or spoken to any lawyer for Sharon Rufo? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You haven't met Natasha Roit before, have you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or John Kelly? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or any other lawyer for the Brown estate? 
 
A: No, I haven't. 
 
Q: When was your meeting with Dan and O.J. Simpson? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Well, I am going to object to that.  It wasn't a 
meeting. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me. 
 
MR. LEONARD: No.  You just need to get -- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me, Dan.  Let the witness testify.  
Okay? 
 
THE WITNESS: It wasn't a meeting.  It was a phone call. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Okay.  It wasn't a meeting; it was a phone call? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Who called whom? 
 
A: I believe Dan was at the phone at Mr. Simpson's house when I 
arrived at Mr. Simpson's house on Wednesday evening. 
 
Q: So you went over to the house of O.J. Simpson Wednesday. 
Right? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: You have to answer audibly. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And Mr. Simpson handed you the phone. Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And said -- 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And said, "Dan's on it." Right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And then you picked up the phone and you spoke to Dan. Right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Was your lawyer present? 
 
A: No, he wasn't. 
 
Q: Was this the first time you had spoken to Dan Leonard? 
 
A: I had met Dan briefly at Mr. Simpson's house a couple months 
ago. 
 
Q: So you have spoken to Dan Leonard twice? 
 
A: Yeah, two or three times. 
 
Q: What's the third time? 
 
A: I don't recall.  If I stop over at Mr. Simpson's house and if Dan 
happens to be there, we say hello. 
 
Q: Have you spoken to any other lawyer for Mr. Simpson in this 
civil suit, other than Dan Leonard? 
 
A: Concerning the case or just -- 
 
Q: Concerning anything. 
 
A: Yeah.  I've met basically all the members of the team that 
defended Mr. Simpson. 
 
Q: Who are the members of the team that you've met? 
 
A: Mr. Cochran, met Mr. Douglas, met Mr. Bailey, Robert 
Kardashian, Mr. Blasier. 
 
Q: Anyone else? 
 
A: Not that I recall. 
 
Q: And you met these people on multiple occasions, I take it? 
 
A: Some of them on multiple. Mr. Douglas I think I only met at the 
court. 
 
Q: Bailey at the court? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Blasier? 
 
A: Blasier I met at Mr. Simpson's house. 
 
Q: Douglas? 
 
A: Only at the court. 
 
Q: Cochran.  Dinner? 
 
A: Dinner and -- 
 
Q: And other occasions? 
 
A: At court. 
 
Q: Dinner and at court. No other places? 
 
A: I had a meeting with him once at his office that lasted about 10 
minutes, 15 minutes. 
 
Q: Any other occasions? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, Mr. Kardashian, you indicated, was a friend of yours.  
Right? 
 
A: Acquaintance. I met him only three or four times. 
 
Q: When? 
 
A: At some dinner evenings.  I met him sometimes when we dropped 
Faye's daughter off at his house to play with his children. 
 
Q: How many times -- Withdrawn.  Did you know Robert 
Kardashian before Nicole's death? 
 
A: Yes, I did. 
 
Q: And you had met him several times -- 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q:-- before Nicole's death.  Is that right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And since Nicole's death how many times have you spoken to 
him? 
 
A: I think only once. The day after the verdict or the day of the 
verdict. 
 
Q: Where did you talk to him? 
 
A: Excuse me? 
 
Q: Where did you talk to him? 
 
A: At O.J.'s house. 
 
Q: You were at the victory party at Mr. Simpson's house following 
his release from jail? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the form of the question, the 
characterization. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: I don't think it could be characterized as a party, but I was there 
for about an hour right after Mr. Simpson arrived at his house, and 
then I 1eft. 
 
Q: There were a lot of people there.  Right? 
 
A: No. At the time when I was there, there were very few people. 
There was just the family. 
 
Q: Just his close family members? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And you. 
 
A: And me. 
 
Q: And you left after Mr. Simpson arrived? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Mr. Cowlings was there also.  Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Why were you there? 
 
A: When a friend gets out of jail, then, you know, l think it's nice to 
be there and -- 
 
Q: Did you invite yourself? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Who did you talk to to get permission to go there? 
 
A: The family. 
 
Q: Who's "the family"? 
 
A: The sisters and the mother. 
 
Q: You know them all? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: You're a close friend of O.J. Simpson's. Right? 
 
A: Yeah, we're friends. 
 
Q: Not close? 
 
A: What's a "close friend"? 
 
Q: You have trouble with that? 
 
A: With what? 
 
Q: You consider him a close friend of yours? 
 
A: I consider him a close enough friend of mine, yeah. 
 
Q: You consider him a dear friend of yours? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
a: You're a lot closer to him now than ever before.  True? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Prior to Mr. Simpson's arrest, did you ever play golf with him? 
 
A: Yeah, I think we played down in Cabo. 
 
Q: Couple times? 
 
A: I was not a golf player, much of a golf player at the time, so I just 
went with him over the course, hit a few balls once. 
 
Q: Now you're learning the game? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: You have to answer audibly.  You have to answer audibly. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Yes or no. Chris. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And you're practicing and playing with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: No, I'm not practicing and playing with Mr. Simpson.  I hit golf 
balls once in his court -- in his yard. 
 
Q: On camera.  Right? 
 
A: I didn't know who was out there. 
 
Q: There were cameras out there.  Right? 
 
A: I presume so because I saw myself on television. 
 
Q: So did I. Tell me about your conversation with Mr. Leonard about 
this deposition last Wednesday. 
 
A: He basically just said that he will be here this morning and that 
I'll see him at 9:30 in the morning. 
 
Q: Anything more than that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he say -- 
 
A: The only thing he said, that he might ask me some questions 
whenever you're done. 
 
Q: He might? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Depending how things go? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Is that what he said? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What's the objection, Mr. Leonard? 
 
MR. LEONARD: You're leading. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Absolutely. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Well, that's my objection. 
 
MR.PETROCELLI: Is there a law against leading an adverse 
witness? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Well, I don't know that it's been established he is 
an adverse witness. Where has a judge ruled that? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: How. many times have you been to Fred Goldman's house? 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: Are you a friend of his? 
 
A: No.  Don't know the man. 
 
Q: Mr. Leonard said he would examine you depending how things 
went.  Right? 
 
A: He would ask me some questions -- 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: -- perhaps at the end of the day. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And did he tell you what he would ask you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What else did he say to you? 
 
A: That's about it. 
 
Q: Did he mention anything that you might be asked? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he discuss anything that might come up here? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: This is the Wednesday conversation.  Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And did he talk to you at all about Faye Resnick? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did the name Faye Resnick come up in the conversation? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he talk to you about drugs? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, do you know whether Mr. Leonard has spoken to your 
attorney? 
 
A: I don't know.  I don't think so. 
 
Q: Do you know whether any of O.J. Simpson's lawyers have spoken 
to your attorney about this deposition? 
 
A: About this particular deposition? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: I don't think so. 
 
Q: Do you know whether your lawyer has ever met with any of Mr. 
Simpson's lawyers? 
 
A: Concerning this deposition? 
 
Q: Concerning anything. 
 
A: Not other than with me. 
 
Q: So you have had meetings with your lawyer present and Mr. 
Simpson's lawyers? 
 
A: Dominick was present the evening that I had dinner with Mr. 
Cochran. 
 
Q: With Johnnie Cochran.  Was that the only occasion? 
 
A: Also at the meeting at Mr. Cochran's office. 
 
Q: Any other occasions? 
 
A: That's it. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: In court. 
 
THE WITNESS: And in court. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And do you know whether Mr. Rubalcava has spoken with any of 
the civil defense lawyers? 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: Now, you said you had met Mr. Leonard on a previous occasion 
at Mr. Simpson's house.  I take it that since Mr. Simpson's release 
from jail, you spend time at his house. Right? 
 
A: Uh-huh, that's correct. 
 
Q: Do you have a key? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And when you met Mr. Leonard the first time, when was that? 
 
A: That was probably about two months ago. 
 
Q: And was there any discussion at all about this lawsuit? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Just a social event? 
 
A: Just a social event, yeah. 
 
Q: Who else was present? 
 
A: The housekeeper, Gigi. I think at that time -- one time Mr. Blasier 
was there.  That's all I can recall. 
 
Q: Was that around the time of the filming of Mr. Simpson's video? 
 
A: No.  It was after. 
 
Q: It was after that?  Gigi and Mr. Blasier and Mr. Leonard? 
 
A: (Nods head.) 
 
Q: Yourself and O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: You are nodding yes, but you have to answer yes. 
 
A: Yes. Yes. 
 
Q: Anyone else? 
 
A: Gigi's baby. 
 
Q: Anyone else? 
 
A: No, that's all I can recall. 
 
Q: Was Cathy Randa there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever met Cathy Randa? 
 
A: Yes, I have. 
 
Q: A number of occasions? 
 
A: Uh-huh, yes. 
 
Q: And prior to Nicole's death how many times had you met Cathy 
Randa? 
 
A: Several occasions. 
 
Q: Two or three? 
 
A: Yeah, two or three, four.  When O.J. and I were talking about 
making the video for Playboy, we would go to O.J.'s office and 
obviously see Cathy there. 
 
Q: And since Mr. Simpson's release from jail, you've seen Cathy 
Randa? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: A number of times? 
 
A: Number of times. 
 
Q: Much more frequently, correct, than before? 
 
A: Than before, yeah. 
 
Q: Now, when you spoke to -- So you last saw O.J. Simpson when? 
 
A: Wednesday. 
 
Q: When you -- 
 
A: Yeah, Wednesday afternoon. 
 
Q: This Wednesday, right, two days ago? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You were at his house? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: You have to answer yes. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And that's when he handed you the phone, and he was talking to 
Dan Leonard when you walked in.  Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And it was Mr. Simpson's idea that you speak to Mr. Leonard? 
 
A: No. Actually Mr. Simpson said, "Christian just walked in," and I 
guess Mr. Leonard said, "Let me just talk to him for a second." 
 
Q: Is that what -- 
 
A: I guess that's the gist from -- 
 
Q: Who was present at Mr. Simpson's home on Wednesday? 
 
A: Gretchen. 
 
Q: And who is Gretchen? 
 
A: Gretchen is a friend of O.J.'s. 
 
Q: Is that Gretchen Stockdale? 
 
A: I don't know her last name. 
 
Q: Is that the woman that O.J. Simpson called on the telephone on 
June 12th? 
 
A: I don't know. I don't know whether he-- whether that is the person. 
 
Q: Is it his girlfriend? 
 
A: She's a friend of his. 
 
Q: Is she single? 
 
A: I don't know.  I really don't know. 
 
Q: Does she spend the evenings there? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Is this the first time you've met Gretchen? 
 
A: No. I've met Gretchen before. 
 
Q: Did you meet her before Nicole's death? 
 
A: No, I never have. 
 
Q: And when did you first hear of Gretchen? 
 
A: Probably about two months before the murder -- two months 
before the verdict.  Sorry. 
 
Q: Sure? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And how did you hear of Gretchen two months before the verdict 
while Mr. Simpson was in jail? 
 
A: I just heard her name mentioned. 
 
Q: From whom? 
 
A: People while I was at -- visiting Mr. Simpson at the jail one time I 
heard the name mentioned. 
 
Q: In what connection? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: What do you understand the relationship between Gretchen and 
Mr. Simpson to be? 
 
A: Friendship. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Friendship. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And how long do you believe they have been friends? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I really don't know. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: How many times have you seen Gretchen other than Wednesday? 
 
A: Probably four or five times. 
 
Q: In social settings? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: You have to answer yes. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You have gone out with Mr. Simpson and Gretchen? 
 
A: I've gone over to Mr. Simpson's house and Gretchen was there 
sometimes. 
 
Q: Are you currently married? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Are you engaged? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And do you have a girlfriend? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you brought any dates over to Mr. Simpson's house -- 
 
A: Yes, I have. 
 
Q: -- since he's been out of jail? 
 
A: Yes, I have. 
 
Q: Who are they? 
 
A: [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Anyone else? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever bring any friends of yours to visit Mr. Simpson in 
jail? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Is [Name Deleted] the only person you have brought to see Mr. 
Simpson after he got out of jail? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And have you and [Name Deleted] and Gretchen Stockdale and 
O.J. Simpson spent time together? 
 
A: Yes. we have. 
 
Q: At his house? 
 
A: At his house and other friend's house. 
 
Q: Who? 
 
A: [Names Deleted]. I don't even know their last names. 
 
Q: In Santa Barbara? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: I don't know their last name.  They're actually friends of [Name 
Deleted] as well from years back. 
 
Q: [Names Deleted] in Santa Barbara? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you've gone to their home? 
 
A: In Santa Barbara once and once in their home here in Los 
Angeles. 
 
Q: They have a home here in L.A.? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Where is that home? 
 
A: In Beverly Hills.  I don't know the address. 
 
Q: [Name Deleted].  Does that ring a bell? 
 
A: I really don't know their last name. 
 
Q: What does [Name Deleted] do for a living? 
 
A: Business. 
 
Q: What kind of business is he engaged in? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: You know nothing about him? 
 
A: I know very little about them other than they're nice people. 
 
Q: Did you know [Names Deleted] before OJ. Simpson's arrest? 
 
A: No, I didn't. 
 
Q: First you've heard of them is when? 
 
A: Actually when I starred dating [Name Deleted], because [Name 
Deleted] and O.J. were talking one day and they realized that they 
know some of the same people. 
 
Q: Did [Name Deleted] know Mr. Simpson before you met [Name 
Deleted]? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How long has [Name Deleted] known O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: I think they first met probably like 10 years ago. 
 
Q: And did they continue to stay in touch with each other? 
 
A: No, they didn't. 
 
Q: When was the last time before Nicole's death that you know 
[Name Deleted] and O.J. Simpson were in contact? 
 
A: Probably eight, nine years ago.  Prior to that, yeah. 
 
Q: Did [Name Deleted] know Nicole? 
 
A: I think she had met Nicole once. 
 
Q: Was [Name Deleted] a former girlfriend of O.J. Simpson's? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or lover of his? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Sure of that? 
 
A: Absolutely. 
 
Q: She told you? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Did he tell you? 
 
A: She was married to a friend of his. 
 
Q: Who? Who was [Name Deleted] married to? 
 
A: [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: No longer? 
 
A: No longer. 
 
Q: Now, going back to Wednesday when you came to Mr. Simpson's 
house, what was your purpose in doing so? 
 
A: Visit. 
 
Q: Social? 
 
A: Just social. 
 
Q: And who was present at the home? 
 
A: O.J., Gretchen, Gigi the housekeeper.  That's it. 
 
Q: You and [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: No.  By myself. 
 
Q: And how long were you there? 
 
A: Probably about 45 minutes. 
 
Q: Was there any conversation at all about your deposition today? 
 
A: No.  It was just "Good luck on Friday" as I walked out the door. 
 
Q: He knew you were taking a deposition? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you talk about it at all other than his saying "Good luck" to 
you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he talk to you at all about Cora Fischman's deposition? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he say a word to you about it? 
 
A: He said that Cora's depo was today -- was that day -- 
 
Q: And he had been there.  He told you -- 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: -- that he had been there.  Right? 
 
A: No, he didn't.  I don't know. 
 
Q: He didn't say a word to you about it? 
 
A: No. He just said that "Cora had a deposition today" as I walked 
out the door, and he said, "Good luck on Friday." 
 
Q: When he said "Cora," you understood that to be Cora Fischman.  
Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Have you had any conversations with Mr. Simpson at all about 
your deposition? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: About -- 
 
A: Other than saying that Friday's, you know, we're here. 
 
Q: What about this case, this civil lawsuit?  Have you talked to him 
at all about this civil lawsuit? 
 
A: Talked about as implications as to how he feels as a person about 
it, how I feel as a person about it, but no -- 
 
Q: And how do you feel as a person about it? 
 
A: About this civil case? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: I think everybody has their right to pose their questions. 
 
Q: What does that mean? 
 
A: Exactly that: Everybody has a right to pose their questions. 
 
Q: You mean the victims' families have the right to pose questions?  
Is that what you mean by that? 
 
A: And Mr. Simpson's attorneys have the right to pose the questions.  
Everybody's just trying to do their job. 
 
Q: Do you think that this is an unfair rap against Mr. Simpson, this 
case? 
 
A: That's a tough question. I think there is in my mind lots of 
questions about this case as to the validity of it. 
 
Q: What are those questions, Mr. Reichardt? 
 
A: Exactly what are the validity of it?  Did everything go right in this 
case?  Why did things get handled the way that they did? 
 
Q: What do you mean by that?  Could you explain yourself a bit? 
 
A: Yeah, I can. 
 
Q: Please do so. 
 
A: From -- from the beginning of this whole case, it was really a 
question in my mind as to what happened.  This case has really 
shaken my belief in society and the justice system, okay, because I 
see that a lot of people have gone forward and proclaimed things 
that happened in a way that they didn't happen, and, you know. over 
the last year and a half it's been a very trying time for me to figure 
out why people are the way they are. 
 
Q: When you talk about this case, you're referring to the civil case or 
the criminal case or both? 
 
A: I think they are in my mind closely interrelated. 
 
Q: Who are the -- Well, is the gist of what you're saying that people 
are proclaiming things that didn't happen, against Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: Yeah. Not just against Mr. Simpson. 
 
Q: But mainly against him.  Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And you think that's unfair.  True? 
 
A: I don't know whether it's unfair. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Just one second, if I might. 
 
(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the 
hearing of the reporter.) 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Is this a good time to take a quick little break? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay good. 
 
(Recess.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Mr. Reichardt, we were talking about your feelings about this 
case and how you think that aspects of it are unjust, and you were 
telling me that people are proclaiming things that did not happen, 
largely against the interests of O.J. Simpson.  Is there anything else 
that you can tell us about your feelings concerning this case? 
 
A: Sure. Part of the reason why I have these feelings is because I see 
how people have profited from this particular case and profited by 
twisting the information in particular ways.  It's very difficult for me 
to understand why people do that. 
 
Q: You haven't profited? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you have any other feelings that you'd like to express about 
the case? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection to the vague nature of the question. 
 
THE WITNESS: That's about it. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Can you tell us a little bit more about why you think O.J. 
Simpson is being unjustly accused of murdering Nicole and Ron 
Goldman?  
 
A: Yeah. Like I said, I see that people have taken the opportunity to 
change things around in their own personal interest and -- 
 
Q: Who are these people? 
 
A: A whole little group of supposed friends. 
 
Q: Can you name them? 
 
A: Sure. 
 
Q: Please do. 
 
A: Kris Jenner, Bruce Jenner, Candice Garvey, Faye Resnick. 
 
Q: Anyone else? 
 
A: Those are the people that I was -- 
 
Q: Referring to? 
 
A: Well, I was close enough with to know. 
 
Q: How much money has Candice Garvey made in exploiting the 
murders of Ron and Nicole? 
 
A: The exploiting it has nothing necessarily to do with monetary 
compensation. 
 
Q: How has Candice Garvey profited other than money? 
 
A: I think it served her purpose in dealing with her husband and her 
friendships with the Jenners. 
 
Q: But you don't have any information that Candice Garvey received 
any money, 
do you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What about Bruce Jenner?  Do you have any information that he 
received any money as a result of these murders? 
 
A: Well, the information is that, you know, they had a full-time 
publicist working that was feeding information to media, you know.  
And in the weeks after the murder, if Kris Jenner and I had a 
conversation, all of a sudden a few days later I would read about 
those 
conversations in the magazines, and to me the only way that it could 
have been brought forward to certain parts of the media is through 
her. 
 
You know, so I have no dollar amounts; I have seen no canceled 
checks or something like that, but to me it's rather obvious. 
 
Q: Do you have any information at all that Chris or Bruce Jenner 
received money? 
 
A: No. Like I say, I have no proof, but -- 
 
Q: Well, I am not asking for proof in the sense that it would be 
admissible in court.  I am asking for any information.  Maybe 
somebody told you, "Hey, Kris got a hundred grand for talking to so-
and-so," anything like that.  Do you have any information like that? 
 
A: The information that I have is, you know, I know how many 
people have -- from the media have stepped towards me and offered 
me money for information, so to me it's sensible to assume that it 
happened for them also. 
 
Q: But you don't know for a fact. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And no one has ever told you that they have gotten money. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Referring to Kris or Bruce. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or Candice Garvey, for that matter. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And Faye Resnick, how has she made money? 
 
A: You tell me. She wrote a book.  She's done television shows. 
She's done newspaper interviews. 
 
Q: What is your understanding, Mr. Reichardt, concerning which of 
these various activities she received money for? 
 
A: What is my understanding? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Like I said. I've had the same sources approach me with offers 
and dollar amounts, and, you know, so it's sensible to assume that 
she'd get the same offers. 
 
Q: Again. you have no information that she received any money 
from any of the media outlets.  Correct? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or that she even asked for any. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you turned down all those media people. Right? 
 
A: Yes. I did. 
 
Q: Of course, the Jenners could have also turned them down. 
 
A: Well, it's like I said, certain pieces of information, conversations -- 
 
Q: They could have turned down the money is what I meant to say. 
 
A: Yes, they could have. 
 
Q: As Candice Garvey could also have. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And so could Faye Resnick.  Right? 
 
A: Absolutely. 
 
Q: So you're just speculating.  Right? 
 
A: I'm only speculating. 
 
Q: Okay.  Now, do you know how much Faye Resnick has received 
in connection with her two books? 
 
A: I have no idea. 
 
Q: And are you aware of any other persons who you believe have 
proclaimed things that did not happen in connection with the deaths 
of Ron and Nicole? 
 
A: I think that a lot of people have done that, you know.  I know that 
Robin Greer has.  I know Robin Greer approached Faye Resnick in 
the weeks after the murder when Faye was saying she didn't want to 
talk to anybody about it, and Robin Greer approached Faye to say, 
"Hey, if you don't want to say, give me the information.  I will." 
 
Q: Meaning that if Faye was not willing to talk about what had 
happened, then Robin would? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: But you don't know of any information that the two of them were 
going to fabricate events or facts, do you? 
 
A: Well, they were going to fabricate that Robin was present in 
certain conversations with .Nicole that she wasn't. 
 
Q: Who told you that? 
 
A: Faye did. 
 
Q: Faye told you that she had a conversation with Robin Greer in 
which Robin told her that she would falsely claim to be present at 
conversations with Nicole? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: When did Faye tell you this? 
 
A: Probably three weeks, four weeks after the murder. 
 
Q: And Faye told her no, she wouldn't participate in that. True? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: True? 
 
A: That's correct. Because she didn't want Robin to give -- to have 
the information and not Faye, and I said, "Hey, you know, that's 
between you guys.  Leave me out of it." 
 
Q: And because it would be false. 
 
A: That's for Faye to decide. 
 
Q: What I am saying to you is that Faye refused to participate in the 
alleged scheme by Robin Greer to falsify evidence.  True? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Thank you. 
 
A: But she said that she would not do it because she wouldn't want 
Robin to go to the media and profit from it, but Faye would want to 
do that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I move to strike the rest of that answer as 
nonresponsive. 
 
Q: Mr. Leonard will give you ample opportunity to lay out O.J. 
Simpson's ideas and theories. 
 
MR. LEONARD: And I move to strike that comment.  That's totally 
unnecessary, Mr. Petrocelli. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You're right. It's self-evident.  I didn't t have to 
say it. 
 
Q: Are you aware of any other conversations between Faye Resnick 
and anyone else in which there was talk about fabricating evidence, 
other than this one incident concerning Robin Greer? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: And are you aware of any other conversations among any other 
persons to fabricate evidence or trump up facts or otherwise falsify 
information? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the compound nature of the question. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, if you could rephrase the question. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Well, I am trying to make the question as humanly broad as 
possible. In other words, I want to pick up every possible instance of 
information that you have in which people were talking about 
fabricating evidence, lying, making up facts that didn't happen, 
putting themselves in conversations when they were not, anything 
like that, falsifying information. 
 
You've mentioned one alleged incident between Robin Greer and 
Faye Resnick, and now I am asking you for anything else. 
 
A: Faye's book. 
 
Q: You mean your reading of Faye's book. No one told you about 
any conversations -- 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: -- where people said, "Hey, you know, let's say that we were there 
when we're not"-- 
 
A: That's true. 
 
Q: --or, "let's falsify information to get O.J." or anything like that.  
Right? 
 
A: I tried to keep myself away from pretty much everybody in the 
weeks after the murder, the months after the murder, so -- 
 
Q: And by "Faye's book," what you are now saying is that you think 
there is false information in Faye's book.  True? 
 
A: Absolutely. 
 
Q: And you've read Faye's book.  Right? 
 
A: Yes, I have. 
 
Q: And you've talked about it with O.J. Simpson.  Right? 
 
A: Yes, I have. 
 
Q: And you have talked about the false information in the book with 
O.J. Simpson.  Right? 
 
A: And other people. 
 
Q: But with O.J. Simpson.  Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And O.J. Simpson you know agrees with you.  True? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Put aside Faye Resnick's book -- Which book are you referring to, 
by the way?  The first book? 
 
A: Both. 
 
Q: Both of them.  Put aside those two books. Are you aware of any 
other information where people told you or it came to your attention 
that anybody was going to falsify information in connection with the 
deaths of Ron or Nicole? 
 
(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the 
hearing of the reporter.) 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let the record reflect the witness is conferring 
with his lawyer. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: By the way, have you read anything concerning this lawsuit to 
prepare for the deposition? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You said you read Faye Resnick's -- 
 
A: I read Faye's book. 
 
Q: -- first book, "Private Diary"?  Excuse me.  Have you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you read "Shattered," her second book.  Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Have you ever read any of the depositions taken in this case? 
 
A: Only mine. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: That's what I was going to say. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: By your "deposition," you are referring to your trial testimony? 
 
A: No. To my interview -- the paper of my interview with Mr. 
Darden that was taken in November '94. 
 
Q:  Okay, we will get to that.  Anything else? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did anybody talk to you about Faye Resnick's deposition and 
what she's testified to in that deposition? 
 
A: I've heard things in the media, on the news, and that's about it. 
 
Q: And you've read Mr. Simpson's deposition? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you read any documents or reviewed any papers to prepare 
for this deposition? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Just your deposition. 
 
THE WITNESS: Just my -- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Your statement, we'll call it. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Your statement to Chris Darden. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When did you read that statement? 
 
A: Last night. 
 
Q: Last night.  Let me go back and pick something up that you 
mentioned before.  Who was at the dinner with Johnnie Cochran, 
yourself and Mr. Rubalcava? 
 
A: That was it. 
 
Q: The three of you? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And that was before you testified? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And that was to talk about your testimony? 
 
A: No.  It was even before my interview with Mr. Darden.  It was 
basically, once I knew that I'm going to be involved in this case -- 
like I said, I stayed away from a lot of people and that whole group 
of people for a while, but once I realized that I'll be involved in it I 
contacted Dominick, who is besides my attorney a personal friend of 
mine, and we just figured out that it might be a good idea to just sit 
down with Mr. Cochran because Mr. Cochran and Dominick had 
been friends for years. 
 
Q: And when did that occur? 
 
A: September, beginning of September of '94, something like that. 
 
Q: And prior to the time when you sat down with Mr. Rubalcava and 
Johnnie Cochran, had you spoken at length to anyone about your 
knowledge concerning the deaths of Ron and Nicole? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Who? 
 
A: Kris Jenner. 
 
Q: Anyone else? 
 
A: Candice Garvey. 
 
Q: Anyone else? 
 
A: That was it. 
 
Q: Any lawyer? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Any representative of Mr. Simpson's? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Any friend of Mr. Simpson's? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Any member of his family? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Any investigator? 
 
A: Only that one time with Mr. Pavelick. 
 
Q: Did the Pavelick coffee talk occur before or after the Cochran 
dinner? 
 
A: I think the -- I believe it was before. 
 
Q: And where did that occur? 
 
A: At the Starbucks on 7th and Montana. 
 
Q: And who was present? 
 
A: Just Mr. Pavelick and I. 
 
Q: And what was discussed? 
 
A: Mr. Pavelick asked me questions about what I knew about Faye, 
what I knew about Nicole, what I knew about what Nicole and Faye 
were up to in the last three months before Nicole's death. 
 
Q: What was the date of that meeting? 
 
A: I don't recall.  I really don't recall. 
 
Q: Was it within a month of Nicole's death? 
 
A: I think it was later than that.  I think it was after my motorcycle 
trip to South Dakota, which is always in the first week of August.  I 
believe it was after that. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: It would have been after August 5th. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, probably after August 15th. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Had you spoken to Mr. Rubalcava by that time concerning this 
case? 
 
A: Briefly. And like I said, I pretty much stayed away from the 
whole thing, even talking to friends about it. 
 
Q: Have you given anybody any documents, photographs, materials, 
pieces of paper, anything at all regarding Nicole Brown Simpson or 
O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Including your lawyer. 
 
A: Including my lawyer. 
 
Q: The answer is no? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, Mr. Pavelick was asking you about what Nicole and Faye 
were up to. Correct? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And he was trying to -- Withdrawn.  He asked you whether you 
knew of the people that they were associating with.  Right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And you told him.  Right? 
 
A: I told him what I knew, yeah. 
 
Q: What did you tell him? 
 
A: I told him that I knew very little of who they were associating 
with because at that time Faye and I had very much disengaged from 
our relationship, you know, and to me it was a matter of when 
opportunities were such where Faye would be high at the house that I 
would ask her to leave. 
 
So from that point on when she left, I don't follow her; I don't know 
who or where, what she hang out with.  I just knew that very often 
she spent time at Nicole's house. 
 
Q: So you were unable to give Mr. Pavelick the names of anybody. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: True? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: He asked you who Faye might be acquiring drugs from? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you didn't know.  Right? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you remember anything else that he asked you? 
 
A: I think the gist of the conversation was primarily that.  He asked 
me when I talked to O.J. last.  He had asked me what the 
conversation was about.  I had told him that -- before the murder, and 
I told him that I had talked to O.J. last about an hour before the 
murder over the phone, and that was it. 
 
Q: How did you know when the murders occurred? 
 
A: Well, I just know about from what was said in the media and the 
court case and what the accusation is when the murders supposedly 
occurred. 
 
Q: When did you last speak to O.J. on the night of the murder? 
 
A: About 9:00 o'clock that night. 
 
Q: Who was the first person to ever ask you when you spoke to O.J. 
Simpson on the evening of June 12th? 
 
A: The first person who ever asked me were the two detectives that 
came to my office and I had an interview with them. 
 
Q: Have you ever asked for the phone record of your conversation 
with O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And are you aware of any evidence that exists that corroborates 
the time of 9:00 o'clock? 
 
A: I'm sure that if the phone records would be asked for Mr. 
Simpson's phone number, it would be on there. 
 
Q: He called you? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And do you know -- are you absolutely positive it was exactly at 
9:00 p.m.? 
 
A: Right about that time. 
 
Q: What's the earliest it could have been? 
 
A: Within minutes. 
 
Q: Based on your recollection? 
 
A: A minute or two minutes around 9:00 o'clock, because I 
remember  that I looked at the 
clock when he called. 
 
Q: You remember that you picked up the phone and you looked at a 
clock. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you remember that that clock said what? 
 
A: 9:00 o'clock. 
 
Q: Was it a numerical/digital clock? 
 
A: No.  Like a dial. 
 
Q: A dial -- 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Analog. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What did you say? 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Analog. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Analog. That's the word now. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Excuse me.  I didn't mean to interrupt, 
Counsel. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's all right. 
 
Q: It was an analog clock. 
 
A: I was watching a movie, and I looked over and it was 9:00 
o'clock. 
 
Q: Now, why did you look at the clock? 
 
A: I always do. 
 
Q: You always do what? 
 
A: When the phone call comes in. 
 
Q: And do you always jot it down, too? 
 
A: No, but I make a mental note. 
 
Q: Did you keep that piece of information fixed in your mind? 
 
A: Very much. 
 
Q: Why? 
 
A: Because the next morning -- I didn't keep that fixed in my mind in 
that moment, but the next day when I found out that, you know, 
Nicole was dead and then later in the day it was said that the police 
is looking for O.J., I in my mind went, my God, I just talked to him 
last night, you know.  It's like, what time was that. 
 
Q: Did you and OJ. in that conversation talk about the time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What movie were you watching? 
 
A: It was some -- some war movie.  I don't remember the name of it. 
 
Q: What station was it on? 
 
A: I don't remember the station. 
 
Q: Was it a video rental, or was it -- 
 
A: No. It was -- 
 
Q: -- a public -- a free TV movie? 
 
A: Cable. 
 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: It was on cable. I don't know which station on cable, though. 
 
Q: Did you continue to watch the movie? 
 
A: Yeah.  Because I remember that by that time -- by like 10:00 
o'clock I went to bed. 
 
Q: Was the movie over? 
 
A: Yeah. Had just finished -- 
 
Q: At 10:00 o'clock p.m. on June 12? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: You were living alone? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: At the Montana residence? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: No one else was home? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Mr. Pavelick tell you about any suspects that he had 
information regarding? 
 
A: No.  I think at that time it was just -- he was just trying to figure 
out what I knew. 
 
Q: Did you ask him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
A: It's not my place. 
 
Q: Didn't you want to know whether your good friend O.J. Simpson 
killed two people? 
 
A: Yeah, but, you know, like I said. I disengaged very much from 
this whole story right after the murders. 
 
Q: It's fair to say that you did not want to believe that O.J. did it.  
Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you still feel that way.  Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And I take it that you believe he is innocent of these charges.  
Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you believe he did not do it.  Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And in fact you're 100 percent sure of that.  True? 
 
A: Can never be a hundred percent sure, but 99 percent, yeah. 
 
Q: Tell us why you're so sure, 99 percent sure, that O.J. Simpson is 
innocent and did not kill Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown. 
 
A: There's a whole bunch of reasons: Number one, I know his 
physical condition, you know.  If you would put O.J. on a chair and 
ask him to jump down, he wouldn't be able to do it, you know.  Like 
I said, I've seen so much -- 
 
Q: Hold on.  Let's take these one at a time.  OJ. Simpson's physical 
condition. You are aware of his physical condition in June of 1994? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: How were you aware of it? 
 
A: You see him walking downstairs -- 
 
Q: Just by walking? 
 
A: He came in for treatment sometimes. 
 
Q: How many times had you treated him before Nicole's death? 
 
A: Probably four or five times. 
 
Q: What did you treat him for? 
 
A: For his knees primarily.  Show him exercises, stretch him out. 
 
Q: Where did you treat him? 
 
A: Sometimes at the office.  Sometimes at his house. 
 
Q: Your office? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Sometimes where? 
 
A: At his home. 
 
Q: And when was the last time you treated him? 
 
A: Since the murders? 
 
Q: No. Before June 12. I'm sorry. 
 
A: Probably a month prior to that. 
 
Q: Where? 
 
A: At the office in Santa Monica, I believe. 
 
Q: Did he make an appointment? 
 
A: Yeah.  He came in as a -- you know, before me starting to see 
patients, just pop in. 
 
Q: Do you have a calendar or appointment book in your office that 
would reflect that visit? 
 
A: No, because he would just come in and -- say, "Can I come in?"  
And I say, "Yeah, come in before the patients start, and we'll just" -- 
 
Q: Do you make any notes of your treatments? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Is there any piece of paper or information or record in your office 
or anyplace else that would indicate when he last was treated at your 
office -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- before June 12? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, you told me you had an appointment book that you were 
going to show me. 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Is there anything in there about this treatment? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Can I see that? 
 
A: Sure. 
 
Q: We'll have to take copies of it.  For the record, Mr. Reichardt has 
handed me an appointment book called a "Pocket/day-timer" for 
1994.  True? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Black with your handwritten notations in it as to various 
appointments? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: What was the purpose of this book?  How did you use it, in other 
words? 
 
A: That's my calendar, my day-timer, to keep track of appointments 
that I have had. 
 
Q: Of business appointments? 
 
A: Business appointments, personal appointments. 
 
Q: Anything else? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you gone back over this and made any corrections to it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever shown it to anyone -- any lawyer or investigator or 
other person involved in the Simpson saga? 
 
A: No.  I just showed it this morning to Dominick and say, "I 
brought this." 
 
MR.RUBALCAVA: In response to your subpoena.  Mention that. 
 
THE WITNESS: As part of the request of the subpoena. 
 
BY MR.PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Now, I notice that there are some Post-its. Were these Post-its put 
in after the fact? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you reviewed this to see if there are any entries in it relating 
to O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: Yes, I've reviewed it as to what the date was of our meeting at 
Playboy. 
 
Q: Why? 
 
A: Because for my own knowledge, I wanted to know when that 
was. 
 
Q: Has anyone discussed that with you? 
 
A: Discussed? 
 
Q: Your meeting with OJ. Simpson at Playboy or for the Playboy 
video. 
 
A: Yeah, I think it came up in the conversation with Mr. Darden. 
 
Q: Since that time has it ever come up again in any conversations 
with Dan Leonard, with other Simpson lawyers or with Simpson 
himself? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know if the Pavelick appointment is in here? 
 
A: No.  That would be later.  This is the first six months of the year. 
 
Q: Yeah.  Where is the rest of this year?  I notice this only goes 
through the end of June -- 
 
A: I have that at home. 
 
Q: -- of 1994.  You have that at home? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: I would like to see that as well.  In fact, I would like to see them 
all the way through to the present. 
 
A: Great. 
 
Q: I am going to have to at a break -- 
 
A: Copy. 
 
Q: -- review this and take copies.  I don't want to spend more time on 
it now.  You guys want to look? 
 
Okay.  So you were telling me about O.J. Simpson's physical 
condition. and could you generally describe -- 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Can we ask a question?  What is the protocol 
for the handling of Mr. Reichardt's property in terms of privacy?  I 
have no problem with anything that happens that the lawyers need to 
work on or their staff or they have to deal with, but there may be 
information or matters there that are personal and/or private, and is 
there a protective mechanism that can be used -- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No. Well, there isn't any protective order in 
place.  All requests have been denied except for Mr. Simpson's 
financial information. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: So this will become public record, accessible?  
Or to what extent? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What we can do if you would like is not 
include this as an exhibit to the deposition transcript.  What I will do, 
if you like, is just include the front -- 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: If there are relevant entries -- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No.  What I would like is production of the 
whole thing, but what I would do is just include in the deposition 
transcript as an exhibit just the cover page of the -- 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: I appreciate that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: -- of the day-planner. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: I'd appreciate it.  Thank you.  You can use it in 
any way that the attorneys need to use it; I don't have any problem 
with that, but just as a courtesy, and I do appreciate that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
Q: Anyway, you were telling me about O.J. Simpson's physical 
condition as the first reason why you believe he's 99 percent 
innocent.  By the way, there is a 1 percent doubt in your mind.  
Correct? 
 
A: I think there's a I percent doubt in anybody's mind. 
 
Q: About OJ. Simpson? 
 
A: About anything. 
 
Q: So nothing can be a hundred percent. 
 
A: Exactly. 
 
Q: But you re about as sure -- you're as sure that O.J. Simpson is 
innocent as you are sure of any other fact. 
 
A: That's right. 
 
Q: Okay.  And I take it your point about his physical condition is that 
he was not -- he was so physically disabled that he was -- that it was 
impossible for him to have killed anyone.  Is that true? 
 
A: Yeah.  In those -- in that particular fashion as those murders 
occurred, yeah, I think it was -- he is physically not capable of doing 
it. 
 
Q: Would you say that he's crippled? 
 
A: Close. 
 
Q: Close to crippled? 
 
A: He's got some major disabilities. 
 
Q: Have you consulted with any physician of O.J. Simpson's 
concerning his physical condition? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever been asked to? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you discussed with Mr. Simpson what treatment he is 
undergoing for his near-crippled condition? 
 
A: At that time prior to the murders? 
 
Q: Yes, prior to the murders.  What is that? 
 
A: Yeah, we had talked about changing his diet and start an exercise 
program and stretching program would be the appropriate way to 
give him some more flexibility in his 
lower extremities. 
 
Q: Changing diet and stretching program. 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: You have to answer audibly. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when did you recommend that those things begin? 
 
A: Starting in the fall of '93. 
 
Q: Is that when you started to treat him? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And that treatment went through the murders on June 12, and you 
say during that time you may have treated him three or four times? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Do you know whether he did in fact change his diet at your 
recommendation? 
 
A: Yeah. he started to, and he started taking a supplement. 
 
Q: What kind of supplement? 
 
A: Called Juice Plus. 
 
Q: Was that your idea, that he go on Juice Plus? 
 
A: No, but it was my idea that he start a nutritional supplement 
program, and then he found the company Juice Plus.  I reviewed it 
and said, "Yes, that looks good to me." 
 
Q: Did that involve taking vitamins? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did it also involve what food he would eat? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: What kind of food did you recommend that he eat to improve his 
condition? 
 
A: Basically recommended for him to stay away from red meat, eat 
more raw veggies and fruit. 
 
Q: Do you know whether he tried to comply with that? 
 
A: At least when I was around. 
 
Q: Okay.  By "red meat," that would also include McDonald's 
hamburgers, I take it. True? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Stretching program. Do you know whether he began to do the 
stretches that you suggested? 
 
A: I didn't see him make very much progress with his legs, so I 
assume that he didn't do the stretches.  And I asked him and he said, 
"Well, you know how it goes.  You're traveling a lot."  And so 
whenever-you know, over the three or four times that we would get 
together, I would stretch him out, I would show him more stretches 
to do, but I don't really believe that he really followed up on doing 
that. 
 
Q: Is that what he told you? 
 
A: No.  I said what I would find when I would treat him again, that it 
hasn't really changed much. 
 
Q: The last time you treated him, though, was a month or two before 
-- 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: -- June 12.  Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So you don't know what he did by way of stretching for the whole 
month of May. 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And the first two weeks of June. 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Did you advise -- give Mr. Simpson any advice about whether he 
should play golf? 
 
A: Golf didn't seem to bother him, didn't seem to aggravate it. 
 
Q: So the answer is no? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you advise Mr. Simpson that he shouldn't participate in any 
strenuous exercise? 
 
A: No.  I think it's pretty much self-explanatory to him that if you do 
anything that was too much, that he would hurt the next day. 
 
Q: So it wasn't that it was impossible to do strenuous things; it was 
that it would hurt if he did so.  True? 
 
A: Yeah.  And, you know, certain activities I would assume would 
be impossible for him to do.  Like seeing him walking down stairs, 
you see somebody walking down the stairs hardly able to do it and 
having to support his body, you know, it's like I said, I would assume 
in putting him on a chair and having him jump down, he couldn't do 
it. 
 
Q: Now, what aspects of the murders of Ron and Nicole do you think 
it would have been physically impossible, based on your judgment, 
for Mr. Simpson to perform? 
 
A: Well, as I understand, there must have been a fight, two people on 
a relatively close, small area.  If you know a little bit about martial 
arts, that's quite a task, you know. 
 
Q: What is quite a task? 
 
A: To combat two opponents in a small space.  If you know 
something about martial arts, you know, there must be twisting, 
turning, you know.  So I don't think that he would be able to do that. 
 
Q: Is it you believe that Nicole Brown Simpson was an opponent 
like a martial arts opponent?  Is that what you're suggesting? 
 
A: No.  I'm suggesting, from what I understand of how the murders 
occurred, that there was a struggle, and as in any kind of struggle in a 
small space involving three people, it takes a lot of physical 
movement.  I talked to a friend of mine who was a martial artist, and 
he said, "Yeah, it would be very difficult to move in a small space 
like that against two people." 
 
Q: Did you ever discuss this with Dr. Robert Huizenga? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Are you aware of his trial testimony on this issue? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever discussed this point -- did you discuss this point 
with Pavelick? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And did you discuss it with Johnnie Cochran at the dinner? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever discussed this point with O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: I think we talked about it, yeah. 
 
Q: When did you talk about it? 
 
A: Probably about two months ago, three months ago. 
 
Q: Relate that conversation. 
 
A: Excuse me? 
 
Q: Relate that conversation.  Tell me who was present, where it was 
and what was said. 
 
A: I think it was one evening late at night when I was with O.J. just 
by himself, and I was relating him -- I was just relating my thought 
processes on this whole case, and in that process I mentioned that, 
you know, his legs and his knees to me would be prohibitive of 
movement like that. 
 
Q: What did he say? 
 
A: He said, "That's interesting." 
 
Q: Did he agree with you? 
 
A: Yeah, he agreed. 
 
Q: He agreed that it would have been physically impossible for him 
to commit these murders? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the form.  It's leading. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You may answer.  By the way, you shouldn't be influenced one 
iota by anything -- 
 
A: I understand. 
 
Q: -- the lawyers say in terms of their objections.  That's just legal 
stuff that the court can deal with later.  Exempt, of course, for your 
lawyer. 
 
A: Can you rephrase the question or repeat the question? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Why don't you have it repeated. 
 
(Pending question read as follows: 
 
Q: He agreed that it would have been physically impossible for him 
to commit these murders?") 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And that's what he told you.  True? 
 
A: Yeah.  Yes. 
 
Q: And did he tell you why it would have been physically 
impossible, what aspect of his body would have been physically 
unable to perform the required movements? 
 
A: I laid that out for him. 
 
Q: As you have laid it out to me? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And he agreed? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And he said, "Christian. you're right."  True? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
(Discussion held off the record.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Let's go back to your points of innocence. What's the next point? 
The first point was his physical condition. 
 
A: The next point was that I saw how, like I say, information was 
misconstrued, manipulated.  Another point is a jury verdict.  You 
know, the jury put out a verdict of his innocence. 
 
Q: But you were convinced of these things before the jury verdict. 
 
A: The jury verdict absolutely reconfirmed what I was thinking 
before. 
 
Q: Tell me about the second point, concerning the information that 
was manipulated and misconstrued, and be as specific as you can. 
 
A: In the weeks after the murder it was put forward how supposedly 
Mr. Simpson was pursuing Nicole, and I know for a fact that it not to 
be true.  O.J. and I at the time starting approximately -- well, not 
approximately.  I could tell you exact time was after the trip to Cabo 
San Lucas on Easter, we had many conversations that the 
relationships we were in were not healthy and that we needed to get 
out of these relationships.   
 
And I know for a fact that there were many times where Nicole or 
Faye were pursuing their respective partners, and O.J. and I would 
talk later throughout the day and compare notes in the sense of how 
both Nicole and Faye were trying to do the same thing at the separate 
households. 
 
There were times I would call O.J. up and say, "Oh, my God, I can't 
believe it.  Faye came back and today says that in order for her to 
feel safe, she wants me to buy her a new car, you know." 
 
And O.J. would laugh and say something like, "This is what 
happened today:  Nicole came back and said very much the same 
thing." 
 
Not that she wanted a new car, but that she needed to have some 
token of his affection to feel safe.  And I know for a fact that, you 
know, both O.J. and I were contemplating and talking about needing 
to getting out of our respective relationships. 
 
Q: Contemplating what? 
 
A: How to get out of our relationships, which I think O.J. was more 
successful than I in the moment when he connected back with Paula 
Barbieri and he started to go on with his life.  He started to go on and 
live his life again with the knowledge that he doesn't want to work it 
out with Nicole. 
 
I remember a specific conversation.  I don't recall the date, but it was 
in the -- probably a week and a half or so after my birthday -- 
 
Q: Which is? 
 
A: April 28th. -- that O.J. said that, you know, he had -- him and I had 
a conversation a year ago when Nicole and him first got back 
together, and he said, "I'm gonna give this one year, and if it doesn't 
work, then I just can't do it." 
 
And so in the conversation about a week and a half or so after my 
birthday, that was exactly the conversation we had, is that he said, 
"It's been a year and it's not changing.  It's not getting any better," 
and I think a few days later he saw Paula Barbieri and reconciled 
with her. 
 
Q: Anything more? 
 
A: As to -- 
 
Q: This issue about O.J. Simpson not pursuing Nicole. 
 
A: Specific incident where -- actually it was on the way to the 
meeting to Playboy, which is in my day-timer.  It's in March 
sometime -- 
 
Q: You want to look at that right now just so we don' t guess about 
that date? 
 
A: Yeah.  That O.J. and I were driving to the meeting -- 
 
Q: Hold on.  Look at the date first. 
 
A: March 21st.  March 21st, a Monday. 
 
MR.PETROCELLI: Let the record reflect the witness is referring to 
his planner, which we will mark as the next exhibit in order at a 
break, which will be Exhibit 167. 
 
Q: Please continue, Mr. Reichardt. 
 
A: Thank you. We were driving in the car, and Cathy Randa called, 
saying how Nicole was trying frantically to reach O.J., and O.J. said, 
"I'm on my way to a meeting with Christian.  I don't want to talk to 
her now."  And he said, "Don't tell her I'm in the car," 
and that was it. 
 
So, you know, the frame of mind that he was in at that time was not 
the, as he has been described, as the jealous person pursuing Nicole.  
I happen to know for a fact that he and I at the time were definitely 
disengaging from our respective relationships. 
 
And there was a third person who knew about that, which was Ron 
Fischman, who was going through a very similar thing with his wife, 
and so the three of us sometimes would talk about how we do not 
feel that the relationships are working out and the difficulties on how 
to get away from the relationship. 
 
Q: So what you're saying is that based on your knowledge, O.J. 
Simpson was trying to get out of his relationship with Nicole.  
Correct? 
 
A: Well, he -- and he did.  He was successful, in my opinion, 
probably about four weeks prior to the murders. 
 
Q: You're sure that O.J. Simpson wanted to get out of his 
relationship with Nicole? 
 
A: Absolutely. 
 
Q: You're sure he wanted to see that relationship come to an end? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And O.J. Simpson told you that.  Right? 
 
A: Yeah, well, we talked about it quite a bit in those three months. 
 
Q: And he told you that.  Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: In fact, as you just said, you talked about it "quite a bit."  Right? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Over -- you have to answer audibly. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Over a number of months.  Right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And O.J. Simpson was unhappy in that relationship with Nicole.  
Correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Would you flatly deny that it was Nicole who dumped O.J. 
Simpson in that relationship at the very end? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: For clarification, can you specify as to when?  
Because I -- if I'm not mistaken -- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.  Let me withdraw the question.  Okay? 
 
Q: At any time in the last three months of Nicole's life, is it true that 
Nicole rejected O.J. Simpson and said, "I am ending the relationship, 
not you"?  Is that true? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't quite -- I don't think it could be answered 
with yes or no. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Why not?  You just told me O.J. Simpson ended the relationship, 
and I am telling you that the opposite may be true.  Okay?  And I am 
now going to probe on that, and I would like you to tell me if you 
know of any information that what you just told me is false and 
that in fact it was Nicole Brown Simpson who told O.J. Simpson, "I 
am ending 
the relationship with you, not the other way around."  Is that true? 
 
A: So you're asking whether I know any information that negates -- 
I'm trying to clarify the question -- 
 
Q: Yes, yes, yes. 
 
A: -- that you're asking.  I think at the time they both went through 
times of wanting to be together, not wanting to be together -- 
 
Q: My question was limited to the time frame that you were referring 
to in your prior narrative answer: The last several months. 
 
A: Yeah, I think that they went back and forth for a period of time, 
and then about four weeks or so before the murders O.J. went back 
with Paula. 
 
Q: Okay. Let's focus on the last time they broke up, which you say 
was four weeks before the murders. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: True? 
 
A: This was when O.J. started seeing Paula again, yes. 
 
Q: Let's focus on that breakup.  You have that in mind? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: You have to answer audibly. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, that to your knowledge was the last time O.J. Simpson and 
Nicole broke up.  True? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And is what you are saying that it was O.J. Simpson who ended 
that relationship with Nicole -- 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: -- not the other way around.  True? 
 
A: That's correct, yes.  
 
Q: And so anyone who would say that Nicole ended that relationship 
would be lying.  True? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you know that it was O.J. Simpson who ended the 
relationship for the last time because O.J. Simpson told you that.  
Right? 
 
A: That's correct.  At that time. 
 
Q: At that time. 
 
A: He told me at that time. 
 
Q: And you believe now and since Nicole's murder, that that fact has 
been misstated. True? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And you believe that rather than the true fact of O.J. Simpson 
ending the relationship being portrayed, what is being said is that it 
was Nicole who ended it and O.J. was pursuing her to change her 
mind.  True? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And you think that's false. 
 
A: That Nicole -- yes. 
 
Q: And what does any of that have to do with your telling me that 
O.J.'s innocent? 
 
A: Well, I think he has been portrayed as the jealous ex-husband, and 
I don't think that that was the fact. 
 
Q: You don't think O.J.-- 
 
A: As it has been portrayed. 
 
Q: You don't think OJ. was jealous in the last month because you 
think it was he, not Nicole, who wanted to stop the relationship.  
Right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And you think O.J. Simpson was free and happy and content to be 
out of that relationship.  True? 
 
A: Yes.  Much more freer and content than he had been in a while. 
 
Q: And O.J. Simpson told you those feelings.  Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: In conversations that you had with him at the time. 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And has he reaffirmed those feelings to you in your many 
conversations since then? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And has he said to you, you know, "Christian, you know as well 
as I do that it was me who stopped that relationship, not Nicole, and I 
was not pursuing her"? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the form. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Has he said those kinds of things to you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You just told me he reaffirmed -- 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: -- those feelings to you. 
 
A: But not in the fashion that you just -- 
 
Q: Well, how did he do it? 
 
A: It's more saying -- trying to figure out how this whole thing got 
misconstrued the way that it did.  We're trying to figure out, and I 
think he's trying to figure out in his head, I'm trying to figure out in 
my head, where did these accusations come from.  How did it evolve 
from him and I having conversations and knowing -- trying to get out 
of the relationships to he's the insanely raging person that is pursuing 
and going after his ex-wife.  It's very difficult in my head also to 
perceive how that has happened, you know. 
 
Q: How many times -- Well, withdrawn.  You've talked to Mr. 
Simpson about what you just said since he got out of jail.  Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How many times have you seen Mr. Simpson since he got out of 
jail?  Now we're talking October, November, December, January, 
February, March -- 
 
A: 20, 30 times. 
 
Q: 20, 30 times?  And how many times have you spoken to him on 
the phone? 
 
A: At least that many times. 
 
Q: So is it fair, 60, 70 times probably, maybe even a hundred? True? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And in a lot of these conversations Mr. Simpson talks about how 
could this all have happened.  Right? 
 
A: I think it's not just Mr. Simpson talking about it.  It's me also 
trying to comprehend. 
 
Q: Now, during the time that Mr. Simpson was in jail, how many 
times did you visit him? 
 
A: I think probably approximately once every two, three weeks. 
 
Q: Throughout the 16 months? 
 
A: Throughout the 16 months, yes. 
 
Q: And how many times did you speak to him on the phone? 
 
A: Not much, actually. Four, five times. While he was in jail? 
 
Q: Correct. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And in any of the meetings that you had with Mr. Simpson in jail, 
were any of his attorneys present? 
 
A: I think Skip was present a couple times.  Skip -- 
 
Q: Who is Skip, for the record? 
 
A: Skip is his long-time attorney and friend.  Skip Taft is his last 
name. 
 
Q: Skip was at the jail with you a couple times? 
 
A: Yeah, he was at the jail when I would come there, and I go to visit 
and chat, and one time I think Skip was there. 
 
Q: What was the first time you visited Mr. Simpson in jail? 
 
A: Probably several months after the murders. 
 
Q: Why did you wait so long to go see him? 
 
A: You know, the murders and the -- Faye going to rehab, it really 
threw me for a loop as a person; it really devastated me and, like I 
said, I made the decision for a number of months to really just stay 
away. 
 
Q: Were you asked to come visit him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he call you or have people contact you and say, "Christian, I 
really want to talk to you.  I miss you" -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- "don't abandon me"? 
 
A: No.  That was my -- that was my decision to call up Cathy and ask 
how could I get to see O.J. 
 
Q: And "Cathy" is Cathy Randa? 
 
A: Cathy Randa, yes. 
 
Q: Before you made the decision to call Cathy to ask for permission 
to see O.J. Simpson, had you spoken to Cathy Randa at all from the 
time of the murders? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Is it true that you spoke to no one on behalf of Mr. Simpson -- 
lawyers, friends, emissaries, middlemen, whatever -- 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: -- until you made the call to Randa to go see him? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: So this was before the Pavelick meeting.  Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: What is the date of the Randa call? 
 
A: I would place it probably before -- I would place it probably after, 
again, our motorcycle trip.  When I say "our," Dominick comes with 
me. 
 
Q: Oh, he did. Did he ride on the same bike? 
 
A: No.  After the trip to Sturgis, which ends August 15th. 
 
Q: So when you got back into town.  Was the motorcycle trip your 
opportunity to kind of clear your head about all of this? 
 
A: Yeah.  Yes. 
 
Q: When you went to see Mr. Simpson for the first time, did you talk 
about his innocence or his guilt? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you talk about the facts and circumstances of the deaths? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Of the relationship with Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: None of that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What did you talk about? 
 
A: "How are you doing?"  You know, it's -- my purpose of going 
down to see O.J. at jail was the thought process of I don't know what 
happened.  It's not my place to decide what happened.  A friend of 
mine got murdered and another friend of mine is sitting in jail 
accused of the murder, and I think probably as much as for his sake 
as for my sake, I was trying to come to grips and to terms with what 
was going on. 
 
Q: Had you decided in your mind as of this point of this first meeting 
with Mr. Simpson that he was innocent? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When did you make that judgment in your own mind? 
 
A: Probably in the weeks before the verdict. 
 
Q: And what was it that caused you to make that judgment at that 
point in time? 
 
A: The activity and handling of witnesses, me, by the prosecution 
team; the continuous, like I said, declarations of facts that I knew 
were not true in the media, through the media, just came to question, 
well, if they are so sure that he's guilty, why all this rigmarole, why 
all this -- 
 
Q: Explain what you mean about the prosecution's handling of 
witnesses. 
 
A: Well. I happen to know that in my case, for example, Mr. Darden 
was not very polite, not very friendly, not very -- trying to say it 
politely -- 
 
Q: This is not the place to mince words. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: No, let... 
 
(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the 
hearing of the reporter.) 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let the record reflect a consultation between 
Mr. Reichardt and Mr. Rubalcava. 
 
Q: Please proceed with your answer. 
 
A: He was like -- you're being polite, you're being professional, and 
Mr. Darden was not.  He was a jerk, you know.  Not only that, but he 
-- by questions he asked me, I knew that he was obviously in contact 
very much with Faye Resnick.  And when I told him, which is not in 
the deposition -- in the interview written because we talked about that 
after the court reporter had quit taking notes, when I told Mr. Darden 
that Faye Resnick never had a diary on which she based her whole 
book and that a lot of the stories that Faye Resnick was bringing 
forward in her book did not happen the way that they did; and when I 
told him that Faye Resnick called me from where she was writing 
her book trying to get dates as to when we were in restaurants, as to 
when we were on vacation, she couldn't even remember names of the 
hotels, she couldn't even remember people that were there, when I 
told Mr. Darden this he became very indignant, and to me it was a 
question of, well, why hasn't he checked on any of this earlier. 
 
Two days later she got dropped from the witness list.  So to me it 
was very obviously he had not done his homework. 
 
When I talked to him about that I had a conversation with O.J. at 
9:00 o'clock on the evening of June 12th, he never asked me, "What 
did you talk about?"  He never asked me, "How did he seem?"  He 
never asked me, "How long did you talk?"  Nothing.  And to me, as a 
prosecutor trying to get the truth of a murder, I thought those were 
pretty important questions, you know. 
 
So to me that's things that in my mind really confirmed the fact that 
this is a case of  I think the police trying to just clear a case out and 
not follow necessarily up on doing the necessary homework to find 
the truth. 
 
Q: Are you aware of any other instances of prosecutors not handling 
witnesses right besides what you just said? 
 
A: Yeah. I got a phone call from a friend who is an attorney, saying, 
"Who's [Name Deleted] in your life?" 
 
Q: [Name Deleted] who? 
 
A: [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: How do you spell that? 
 
A: [Name Deleted] and I were married for a four-year period of time. 
 
And I said. "What" -- "Why?"  And the answer was, "Well, the D.A.'s 
office is investigating who she is in your life." 
 
"What does she have to do with anything?" you know. 
 
I know that Cora Fischman was treated relatively rudely.  I know 
that Candice Garvey came to my office one day, and it was in 
December of '94, she came in for treatment three, four times in a row 
for headaches, and I asked her, "Candice, what's going on?  You're 
very nervous. What's happening? 
 
And she said, "The prosecution team is driving me nuts." 
 
And I said, "What's up?" Her answer was that they wanted her to 
change her story of what happened at the evening of the recital. 
 
And I said, "Cora" -- "Candice, look, just stick to what you know.  
You know what happened.  Just keep saying what you know what 
happened.  That's it.' 
 
Well, she explained to me that O.J. at that night to her seemed 
quieter, seemed tired, but he seemed pretty normal to her.  However, 
whenever her date was in the court, she gets up in the court and says 
in what gloomy mood he was.  So I know she changed her 
testimony.  I want to know why. 
 
I know through Cora -- I haven't talked to Ron Fischman, but I know 
through Cora that Ron was intimidate and was told that, you know, if 
he comes forward and gives his testimony of what he was talking to 
the D.A.'s office about, that he might get exposed for utilizing or 
taking some medications. 
 
You know, I know people were -- I don't know whether I want to call 
it threatened, but put on warning to not come forward with the 
information they had and, at the same token, people that were not 
relaying the truth were continuously brought forward as this is what 
happened, this is what happened, this is what happened. 
 
Q: Any other instances of which you are aware? 
 
A: No.  That's it.  That's all. 
 
Q: Are you aware of any defense lawyers or investigators 
mishandling or mistreating witnesses?  
 
A: Not that I'm aware of. 
 
Q: If they did the same thing, you would look as badly on them as 
you do the prosecutors? 
 
A: Oh, absolutely. To me it's a question of ethics, you know.  It's -- 
 
Q: Now, what's this about Ron Fischman being exposed for 
prescribing medication?  Tell me about that. 
 
A: I think at the time before the murders, that three-month period of 
time when O.J., Ron and I would talk about Cora, Faye and Nicole 
doing whatever it is that they were doing, I think Ron Fischman was 
definitely the most affected, and he -- his way of dealing with the 
situation was to I think anesthetize himself to some extent to be able 
to deal with it, you know. 
 
Q: Did Ron Fischman provide medication for friends -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- who were not his patients? 
 
A: Not to my knowledge. 
 
Q: Not to your knowledge? 
 
A: Not to my knowledge, no. 
 
Q: Did he prescribe Xanax to O.J. Simpson to your knowledge? 
 
A: Not to my knowledge. 
 
Q: To Faye Resnick? 
 
A: No, definitely not to Faye. 
 
Q: To you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: To Nicole? 
 
A: Not to my knowledge. 
 
Q: Do you know who Naomi Fischman is? 
 
A: I believe it's his mother. 
 
Q: Do you know that a pill vial of Xanax in the name of Naomi 
Fischman was found in O.J. Simpson's possession at the time of his 
arrest? 
 
A: I understand that that's what happened. 
 
Q: And do you know how that pill bottle got there? 
 
A: I understand from what happened at the time before the murders 
when O.J. and I talked is that he -- that Nicole one day called up O.J. 
and said, "O.J. do me a favor.  Call Ron.  He's going nuts." 
 
Because of what happened. O.J. called Ron, and Ron was driving 
around in his car, and he had Ron come to his office, and O.J. asked 
him -- or Nicole had told him that Ron is taking medication, and O.J. 
asked Ron to give him the pills that he was taking, so that Ron had to 
get off the pills and get back to the office and see patients and do his 
business and so forth, and he took him then down to the Starbucks 
around the corner by his office.  So that's how I understand that a 
box of pills got to O.J.'s office. 
 
Q: Is what you're telling me, Mr. Reichardt, that at Nicole's request 
O.J. Simpson went to see Ron Fischman, who was going through 
some considerable stress, and when he saw Mr. Fischman at 
Starbucks, he inquired whether he had any pills on him, and once he 
learned that he had Xanax, he took it away from him?  Is that what 
you're saying? 
 
A: My understanding of it was that Ron came to O.J.'s office, and in 
the office O.J. acquired the tube of pills from Ron -- 
 
Q: And why did O.J. do so? 
 
A: So that Ron wouldn't take them anymore. 
 
Q: O.J. believed that Ron was taking these pills? 
 
A: Right.  Well, we all knew that Ron was taking pills at the time. 
 
Q: Oh, you did know that. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Xanax in particular? 
 
A: I don't know what medications. 
 
Q: What does Xanax treat? 
 
A: I think it's an antidepressive. 
 
Q: And OJ. Simpson believed Ron was taking Xanax? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And he asked Ron for the pills? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And Ron turned them over? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And this occurred in O.J. Simpson's office? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Not in Starbucks? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And Ron -- 
 
A: As far as I understand it. 
 
Q: Ron just happened to have the pills on him. True? 
 
A: Well, I think Ron at that time was taking medications and carried 
them with him. 
 
Q: And do you know why the pill prescription was in the name of 
Naomi Fischman? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: What did O.J. Simpson do with the pills? 
 
A: When we talked on the phone later that day, we didn't talk about 
what happened with the pills.  He said, "I just took them from him." 
 
Q: What did he do with them? 
 
A: I don't know.  He just said, "I took them from him." 
 
Q: Did he throw them away? 
 
A: I don't know.  I really don't know.  I have no idea. 
 
Q: Do you know why he had them on June 17th? 
 
A: I have no idea. 
 
Q: Do you even know if they're the same pills? 
 
A: I have no idea. 
 
Q: Now, everything you've just related to us, you don't know 
firsthand.  Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Who told you all of this?  O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: Later that day or the next day we talked about it.  Because a 
couple days after that I went to Ron Fischman's house because Cora 
called me up and says, "Chris, can you please come over here?  Ron 
is in bed for the last day or two, and he's totally out of it." 
 
So O.J. and I later, we talked about -- 
 
Q: So what you're telling me is not only can you say that O.J. 
Simpson told you this whole story, but you can also corroborate it 
because Ron Fischman told you as well.  Is that what you're saying? 
 
A: No, I don't think Ron told me at the time, because he was too out 
of it. 
 
Q: So who is the other person?  Cora who told you this? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: So both Cora and Ron have given you essentially the same 
account -- excuse me.  Both OJ. Simpson and Cora Fischman told 
you what you just related to me. 
 
A: Essentially, yes. 
 
Q: And you remembered that.  Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Now -- 
 
A: Now -- 
 
Q: -- that is your explanation for why Ron Fischman's pills or Naomi 
Fischman's pills were found in O.J. Simpson's possession? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: While we are on that subject, why don't you also tell me about the 
disguise, the fake goatee and mustache, and tell me why that was in 
O.J. Simpson's possession. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Lack of foundation. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Do you have any information how that happened to be in O.J. 
Simpson's 
possession? 
 
A: No idea. 
 
Q: You've been out with O.J. Simpson many times before June 12, 
1994, including in public.  Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And how many times did you see him don a disguise to conceal 
his identity? 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: And is it fair to say that O.J. Simpson liked being famous? 
 
A: I think he was always very polite to people. 
 
Q: And he didn't try to hide from people who he was.  True? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: True? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: So you never saw him take any efforts to disguise himself.  True? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: So you would therefore find not credible his explanation that he 
obtained this disguise to conceal his identity.  True? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
THE WITN ESS: I wouldn't know how to answer whether I would 
find it credible or not.  It's -- I don't even think about why or why not 
somebody would do that.  It's -- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Have you ever discussed this story about the pill -- the Ron 
Fischman pills with O.J. Simpson since he got out of jail? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And have you discussed with him the mustache, the fake goatee 
and mustache? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever asked him, "Hey, Mr. Simpson," or "O.J.," 
whatever -- What do you call him? 
 
A: O.J. 
 
Q: -- "why was this in your possession?" 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ask him why the pill vial was in his possession? 
 
A: I knew why it was in his possession. 
 
Q: Well, no. You just told me that you knew that he had taken it 
from Ron Fischman at his office in Brentwood. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: But you didn't give me any information as to why weeks later, 
while he's fleeing the police, that the pill vial was in his possession. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the characterization "fleeing the police." 
 
THE WITNESS: To me it's not a question.  I happen to put things 
somewhere and I don't put them away, I don't throw things away -- in 
my mind it didn't create a question why those pills would be there X 
weeks later after knowing the story that happened with Ron. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: "There" being where? 
 
A: At O.J.'s office. 
 
Q: No.  The pills being where? Where were they found on June 17?  
Do you know? 
 
A: I believe, as far as I understand it, that they were found in his 
office. 
 
Q: They were found in his black grip, his -- you know what his black 
grip is, his shoulder bag? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Are you aware of that? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: This is the first time you learned that? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: So when you discussed this with O.J. Simpson, he never said to 
you, "Well, wait a second.  That's not the whole story.  It was in my 
black grip, my shoulder bag, not in my office."  Did he ever say that 
to you? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Yes or no. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't believe so. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: He never explained that to you.  Correct? 
 
A: It's -- 
 
Q: Correct? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. We will break for lunch here. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Good, because I was just going to ask. 
 
(At the hour of 12:20 p.m., a luncheon recess was taken, the 
deposition to resume at 1:20 p.m.) 
 
(At the hour of 1:22 p.m., the deposition of CHRISTIAN H. 
REICHARDT was resumed at the same place, the same persons 
being present.) 
 
(Plaintiffs' exhibit 167 was marked for identification by the reporter 
and is attached hereto.) 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Back on the record. 
 
EXAMINATION (Resumed) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: We are back from lunch.  I would like to start by having you 
relate to us your discussion with Johnnie Cochran at dinner 
sometime when? 
 
A: Probably September of '94. 
 
Q: Okay. Whose idea was it to get together for dinner? 
 
A: I think it was actually Dominick's idea. 
 
Q: Where did you go? 
 
A: We went to Chaya Brasserie on Main Street in Venice. 
 
Q: Okay. Why don't you relate the conversation. 
 
A: The conversation with Mr. Cochran was very similar to the 
conversation that I had with Mr. Pavelick, but a little bit more in 
detail, and it was basically more me relaying things that I knew 
about O.J., the case, Faye, Nicole prior to the murders, in the months 
before the murders. 
 
Q: Was anyone there with Mr. Cochran? 
 
A: No.  He was by himself. 
 
Q: And did he take notes? 
 
A: He took some notes. 
 
Q: And did Mr. Pavelick take notes? 
 
A: Yes, he did take some notes. 
 
Q: Have you ever seen those notes?  
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Pavelick was not at that meeting. 
 
THE WITNESS:  Oh, yeah, he was at a different meeting 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Different meeting.  That was the breakfast at -- did you say 
Starbucks? 
 
A: Starbucks. 
 
Q: Have you ever seen those notes? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Has anyone ever tape-recorded a conversation with you? 
 
A: No.  Other than Christopher Darden. 
 
Q: Other than Christopher Darden? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: So you went over with Mr. Cochran the information you had 
concerning Mr. Simpson's relationship with Nicole? 
 
A: Basically more the events prior to the murders.  We didn't really 
talk about the relationship of O.J. to Nicole at the time. 
 
Q: What do you mean by "the events"? 
 
A: More like times as to when Faye was going over to Nicole's 
house, when the whole thing started that Faye and Nicole started 
going out. 
 
Q: Have you ever written down you information so that you would 
not forget it? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And where did you write it down? 
 
A: I wrote it down in note pads at home. 
 
Q: Where are those note pads?  
 
A: I have them at home. 
 
Q: I need to see those. 
 
A: No problem. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Write it down so you don't forget it. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  
 
Q: Has anyone ever seen those note pads, Mr. Reichardt? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever told anyone about them? 
 
A: I talked to a friend of mine as why I'm keeping notes:  So that I 
can keep it clear in my head and get recollection as to what 
happened. 
 
Q: And who is this? 
 
A: [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: Is that a woman? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: When did you tell [Name Deleted] about the notes? 
 
A: Oh, probably as I was taking the notes, over a course of months. 
 
Q: And when did you begin to take the notes? 
 
A: I would say probably December that year. 
 
Q: After the Cochran dinner? 
 
A: Yeah, way after that. 
 
Q: Did Cochran suggest that you do so? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did anyone suggest it to you? 
 
A: No. 
 
a: Does Mr. Simpson know about these notes? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever told anyone other than [Name Deleted] about these 
notes? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How long are the notes? 
 
A: Probably like 50 pages or so. 
 
Q: Have you prepared these notes in anticipation of writing a book 
one day? 
 
A: I thought about it, but the notes are more my -- helping my own 
thought processing as to what was going on.   
 
Q: I would like you to bring the notes on Monday, but I have a 
request, and that is I don't want you to show them to Mr. Simpson or 
any of his lawyers. 
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q: Okay? 
 
A: No problem. 
 
Q: I don't want him to have access to those notes before I do. 
 
A: No problem. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Is that agreeable? 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: I don't have any problem with that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you. 
 
MR. BREWER: Let me just ask, was it 50 or 15? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: 50, 5-O. 
 
THE WITNESS: 50. 
 
MR. BREWER: Thanks. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And I would request that you not read those notes to Mr. Leonard 
or any other lawyer for Mr. Simpson or to Mr. Simpson.  I would 
like to have a chance to review those without any prior access of Mr. 
Simpson.  Is that fair? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Thank you.  Have you had any discussions with book publishers? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: At any time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you had any discussions with collaborators? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you have any present intention to write a book? 
 
A: I'm thinking about it. 
 
Q: Have you talked to OJ. Simpson about that at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What would your book be about? 
 
A: The book would be about ethics and the book would be about 
questioning why people have behaved the way that they have in the 
light of this trial and in the light of this story. 
 
Q: You're referring to what you believe has been some of the 
inappropriate conduct of witnesses and other events that have caused 
Mr. Simpson to be unjustly accused, in your view.  True? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, if -- Okay.  Now that you've mentioned the notes, is there 
anything else that you have at home or anywhere, for that matter, 
that in any way, shape or form relates to this case, any writings you 
have made, any musings, any tape recordings, anything? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Your lawyer was chiding me during the break about the fact that I 
didn't ask you about computer information, and I didn't because I 
don't venture into that territory since I'm computer illiterate, but -- 
 
A: So am I. 
 
Q: -- but do you have any information on computer, on any kind of a 
hard drive or disk -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- or anything like that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever set down with [Name Deleted] to talk about your 
thoughts? 
 
A: Oh, yeah.  Yeah. 
 
Q: So [Name Deleted] was involved in your preparing these notes? 
 
A: No. She's involved in -- she's a friend of mine that I can talk to 
about what goes on in my head. 
 
Q: When did you first talk to [Name Deleted] about this OJ. Simpson 
situation, that is, the deaths of Nicole and Ron right after they 
happened? 
 
A: Probably in the week after the murders. 
 
Q: She was a friend of yours even before the murders? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: She was someone that you confided in and talked to? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did Faye know her also? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Did O.J. Simpson know her? 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: How far does your relationship with [Name Deleted]date back? 
 
A: 1984. 
 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 168 was marked for identification by the reporter, 
the first page of which is attached hereto and the original was 
retained by Mr. Rubalcava.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I have attached as Exhibit 168 the photocopy of your January to 
June 1994 day-timer. Okay? 
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q: And we will review that over the weekend -- 
 
A: No problem. 
 
Q: -- in preparation for Monday. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: After copies have been made and everyone's 
comfortable with the level of the copies, may the originals be 
returned? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The original day-timers? 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes, I will return them to you with an 
understanding that you will preserve them in their current condition 
and not make them available to anyone until the time of trial. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You had told me before the break about two essential points 
demonstrating Mr. Simpson's innocence: One was his physical 
condition, and the other was the information that was being 
misconstrued and manipulated in the public. 
 
Do you recall that testimony? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Is there anything else that you have to add to that? 
 
A: No.  I think that covers it. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Excuse me a moment. 
 
(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the 
hearing of the reporter.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You have had a chance to confer with your lawyer.  Do you have 
something to add? 
 
A: Yeah. The other part is that since the trial I've been able to follow 
a little bit more of the evidence, and some of the pieces of evidence 
just didn't make that much sense to me. 
 
Q: And what are they? 
 
A: The location of the glove, the supposed... 
 
(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the 
hearing of the reporter.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Your lawyer has just conferred with you again. 
 
A: The testimony of Mr. Fuhrman, the way that Mr. Fuhrman's 
testimony was handled when he was asked to come back. 
 
Q: Anything else? 
 
A: The location of the bloody socks in O.J.'s room, knowing what a 
tidy man he is.  That's just about it. 
 
Q: Now, with respect to the location of the glove, could you explain 
in greater detail what you mean? 
 
A: Well, I haven't gone into the back part of the house, but I know 
the floor plan of the house, and I know where that location would be, 
and it just seems very impossible to me to -- how it was proposed 
that, as far as my understanding is, how somebody that is covered 
with blood goes through the house that is very light carpet, through 
the house to the back corner there, put a glove there and then have no 
blood along the trail where you would have to go in order to drop a 
glove.  It just doesn't make any sense to me. 
 
Q: Anything else about that point? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And the testimony of Mr. Fuhrman, what do you have to say 
about that? 
 
A: It's -- well, number one, it's very unbelievable to me that he never 
used the N word.  To me it was -- it's pretty clear that hardly anybody 
in this room has done that or in this country has done that.  And the 
fact that then when he was asked to come back for further testimony, 
that he just evoke the Fifth Amendment. 
 
Q: Anything else? 
 
A: That's about it. 
 
Q: And the last point, about the bloody socks in O.J. Simpson's 
room. 
 
A: Right. O.J. is a very tidy man.  You know, he gets up in the 
morning and makes his own bed right away.  It's like a very key 
issue to him to have things tidy. 
 
Q: How do you know that, that he makes his own bed in the 
morning? 
 
A: I've been there. 
 
Q: You've been in his bedroom in the morning when he gets up? 
 
A: Sounds funny, but I've helped him in the morning, to come over 
there and do some stretching and get him going and do some 
exercises. 
 
Q: How often have you done that? 
 
A: Like I said, before the murder probably couple times, and since 
the murder, once. 
 
Q: And when you did it before the murder a couple times, you did it 
in his bedroom early in the morning? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Last time was a month or two before the murders? 
 
A: Actually probably more like four months before the murders. 
 
Q: Did you talk to Mr. Simpson during the lunch break? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or anyone? 
 
A: My secretary. 
 
Q: Okay.  And your lawyer. but that's it. Right? 
 
A: And my lawyer. 
 
MR.RUBALCAVA: Excuse me.  We also talked to a mutual friend 
of ours, not about this case at all. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You had no conversations about this case? 
 
MR.RUBALCAVA: No conversations about this case. 
 
BY MR.PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: So now your best recollection is that you did the stretching -- the 
last kind of stretching that you did with O.J. Simpson was about four 
months before June 12, 1994. 
 
A: The last time that I was at his home doing the stretching. 
 
Q: Last time at his home. But the last time you did it at all was 
when? 
 
A: Was a couple or months or so before -- 
 
Q: Couple of months? 
 
A: Yeah, something around then. 
 
Q: And that would have been at your office? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: On this subject of his physical condition. are you planning to 
testify at trial about Mr. Simpson's physical condition? 
 
A: If I'm asked to.  I haven't been asked to. 
 
Q: Have you been asked to? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Are you -- 
 
MR. LEONARD: No, we are not planning to call him as an expert 
witness on that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: And I assume that he will be then offering no 
testimony whatsoever about Mr. Simpson's physical ability or not to 
commit these murders? 
 
MR. LEONARD: No, he will not. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: When you said that you thought it was impossible for him to 
commit these murders, you didn't mean that you had formed a 
professional judgment to that effect. 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: That was just your personal opinion? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And you hadn't done any real analysis or study or made any 
medical or scientific effort to make that judgment.  Right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Now, did you ever talk to O.J. Simpson about this point you made 
concerning the questionable location of the glove?  You've talked to 
him about that.  Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And he agrees with you? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And he agrees with you concerning your comments about Mr. 
Fuhrman? 
 
A: Yeah, we had a conversation about that briefly sometime. 
 
Q: And have you talked to O.J. Simpson about the location of the 
bloody sock in his room? 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: Never once mentioned that at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you seen his video? 
 
A: I've seen a part of it, the first five minutes. 
 
Q: You didn't watch the whole thing? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
A: I had to go. 
 
Q: You had to go where? 
 
A: I went home.  I had to make some phone calls. 
 
Q: Where were you? 
 
A: I was at O.J.'s house. 
 
Q: He was watching it? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: The finished product? 
 
A: The finished product. 
 
Q: Who was there watching it with him? 
 
A: I think Dan was there, Mr. Blasier was there, his housekeeper 
Gigi. 
 
Q: When was this? 
 
A: I just stopped by to say hello. 
 
Q: "Dan" is Dan Leonard.  Right? 
 
A: Dan Leonard, yeah. 
 
Q: And when was this? 
 
A: Whenever that video came out. 
 
Q: And what was O.J. Simpson saying at the time? 
 
A: You know, I really didn't pay that much attention.  I stopped by, 
was there for a few minutes, and I left. 
 
Q: So you've never seen any part of the video other than the first five 
minutes? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did you have any conversations with Mr. Simpson about this 
video before he made it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you know that he is receiving money for it? 
 
A: I believe so, yeah. 
 
Q: Does that trouble you, that he is profiting from the murder of his 
ex-wife and the mother of his children? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't believe that he's profiting from the murder.  
I think he's explaining himself, and I think he has a right to make 
money. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: He has as much right to make money as any other person.  True? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: So you don't fault him that he will receive money for the sale of 
the videotape that deals with the murder of the mother of his 
children.  True? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Have you and O.J. Simpson talked about the so-called efforts on 
his part to find the real killer or killers? 
 
A: We did several months ago. 
 
Q: How many months ago? 
 
A: Probably after the -- after the verdict. 
 
Q: Where were you and where was he when you had this 
conversation? 
 
A: I believe we were at his house, sitting in the garden. 
 
Q: Just you and him? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And relate the conversation. 
 
A: It was very brief, that he said he still would like to find out who 
did the murders. 
 
Q: And did you -- what did you say? 
 
A: I said, "That's a good idea." 
 
Q: What did he say? 
 
A: That's about it, you know.  Nothing -- 
 
Q: End of conversation? 
 
A: End of conversation. 
 
Q: Now, have you had any other conversation with O.J. Simpson 
about finding the real killer or killers? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know whether O.J. Simpson has done anything to find the 
real killer or killers? 
 
A: I don't know.  I'm not privy to that information. 
 
Q: Do you ask him from time to time, "What are you doing?" 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Are you aware of a statement read on his behalf by his son Jason 
following the acquittal that Mr. Simpson would devote his life's 
work to finding the real killer or killers? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And have you pursued with Mr. Simpson what he is doing to 
make -- to satisfy that commitment? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you care if he does anything one way or the other? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
Il21 THEWITNESS: Yes, I would love to find out who the killers 
are, but it's not my job to tell anybody what they should or shouldn't 
do. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And do you care -- 
 
A: Oh, yes. 
 
Q: -- if he does anything to find the real killer? 
 
A: Like I said, see, I detached myself from caring what he does or 
not.  That's not my -- I'm not trying to be argumentative with you.  
I'm trying to explain to you.  It's not my job to ask him what he does 
or to care.  It's -- you know, I draw the line where I get myself 
involved. 
 
Q: Have you -- 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Excuse me.  Excuse me for one second. 
 
(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the 
hearing of the reporter.) 
 
THE WITNESS: As a friend of Nicole, I would like to find out what 
happened, you know.  That's what I was trying to say.  I would like -- 
when I talk to O.J. and he said that he's pursuing it, I said, 'That's a 
good idea." 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And have you followed up with him since that one conversation 
many months ago? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Are you aware whether he has spent any money or done a single 
thing to find the killer? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Do you have any such information? 
 
A: I have no information. 
 
Q: Would it disappoint you to find out that he has done nothing at 
all? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: It would not disappoint you? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
A: Because it's not my job to figure out what he does.  You know, 
people will do what they will do. 
 
Q: Did you ever ask Mr. Simpson why his blood was found at 
Nicole's condominium? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Never did? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever ask him why his blood was found in his -- at the 
Rockingham home? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever ask him why he was bleeding on the very same 
night that his wife was murdered? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever ask him why Nicole's blood was found in the 
Bronco? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or why Ron Goldman's blood was found in the Bronco? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or why fibers from Mr. Simpson's clothing were found on Nicole 
and Ron? 
 
A: Never asked. And that might sound strange, but I don't -- 
 
Q: It does sound strange. 
 
A: -- but I don't involve myself in that, no. 
 
Q: But you've had many, many conversations with Mr. Simpson and 
you have formed the opinion that he is as innocent as a person could 
be, yet you have never once inquired about any of these pieces of 
evidence.  True? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: True? 
 
A: With him directly, no, never.  I never have. 
 
Q: And has he ever bothered to ask you -- or bothered to explain to 
you how that evidence got there? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Has he ever said to you in words or in substance, "Mr. Reichardt" 
or "Christian" -- what does he call you? 
 
A: Christian. 
 
Q: Christian or Chris.  I notice your lawyer cells you Chris. 
 
A: Christian. 
 
Q: "Christian.  I don't want you to get the wrong idea here, but let me 
tell you why that blood was found at Bundy."  He never -- 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: He never said that to you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Never had a discussion about that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Are you curious? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Why don't you ask him? 
 
A: Because it's not my place. 
 
Q: Don't you want to know who killed Nicole? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative. Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes, I do want to know who killed Nicole, but -- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Don't you think by asking him you might be able to satisfy 
yourself one way or the other? 
 
A: No, 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Don't you believe it might give you some insight as to whether 
your friend O.J. Simpson, your very dear friend, may be the guilty 
person? 
 
A: I don't need any further insight. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: So in other words, if Mr. Simpson were to admit that that indeed 
was his blood at Bundy and was his blood at Rockingham and it was 
Nicole's blood in the Bronco and was Ron's blood in the Bronco and 
so forth, it would not change your opinion.  True? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: That's a hard question to answer. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: That's why I asked it. 
 
A: If he himself would say that he committed the murders and that is 
the reason why all the evidence was found, obviously I would 
change my mind. 
 
Q: Have you asked him that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you asked him, "O.J., did you do it?" 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Has he told you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Has he told you that he killed Nicole or Ron Goldman? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Has he told you that he did not do so? 
 
A: No.  See, you have to understand, I don't -- I might not have the 
same questions that many other people have because it's not my 
thought processing to deal with it like that.  There's certain things 
that I can be responsible for, and that's it, and that's just my life, so... 
 
Q: What kind of questions did you ask O.J. Simpson to satisfy your 
own feelings about his responsibility? 
 
A: I didn't. 
 
Q: How did you first hear of Nicole's death? 
 
A: Faye's ex-husband called me at my office. 
 
Q: Paul Resnick? 
 
A: Paul Resnick. 
 
Q: When was that? 
 
A: It was about 10:00 o'clock Monday morning, the day of the 
murder. 
 
Q: And what did he tell you? 
 
A: He told me that Nicole had been murdered, and he asked me 
whether I thought Faye was safe in the rehab center where she was at 
and -- because him and I -- I asked him why, and he thought that 
possibly this was a drug-related murder. 
 
Q: This is what Paul Resnick told you? 
 
A: Right.  And Paul Resnick was one of the few people who knew 
where Faye was, and he asked me whether I had told anybody else 
where Faye was.  He asked me whether I thought it was prudent to 
get Faye out of the rehab center and fly her to his ranch in -- I believe 
it's in Idaho. 
 
And I said, "Well," you know, "nobody other than very closest 
friends know where Faye is at, "so I thought she was safe wherever 
she's at. 
 
Q: In other words, you made the decision that you would not move 
Faye.  Correct? 
 
A: Paul and I made that decision together, yeah. 
 
Q: And you did not move Faye. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And so you thought that she was safe where she was.  True? 
 
A: Because nobody knew where she was. 
 
Q: Regardless of the reasons, you thought she was safe.  True? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And there were a number of people who in fact knew where she 
was.  True? 
 
A: Only the people that were present during the intervention. 
 
Q: The intervention.  And they may have told other people. 
 
A: They may have.  I wouldn't -- yeah. 
 
Q: And the people present at the intervention included yourself. 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Paul Resnick. Of course Nicole was there. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Kris Jenner. 
 
A: Kris Jenner, Bruce Jenner -- 
 
Q: Bruce Jenner. 
 
A: -- and [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: [Name Deleted].  And O.J. Simpson knew, too. Right? 
 
A: He came back into town, and I think at the recital Ron told him -- 
Ron and Cora told him that I had put Faye in the rehab center.  So 
that was what prompted his phone call to me on that Sunday 
evening:  To see how I was doing, to see how I was holding up. 
 
Q: Faye went into the rehab center on June 9? 
 
A: A Thursday. 
 
Q: Thursday? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Look at your calendar. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: He knows the date. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: What is the date? 
 
A: The Thursday of -- 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: The first full week of -- 
 
THE WITNESS: Do you have '94? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Thursday is June 9, 1994. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And that's when Faye was admitted? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: After June 9, 1994, when was the first time you spoke to O.J. 
Simpson? 
 
A: After June 9, was that Sunday evening. 
 
Q: Okay.  So you didn't hear from O.J. Simpson all day on June 9, 
'94. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And you did not hear from him all day on June l0, l994. True? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And you did not hear from O.J Simpson all day on June 11, 1994. 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And you did not hear from OJ. Simpson at all during the hours of 
6:00 a.m. through noon on June 12.  Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And you did not hear from O.J. Simpson at all from noon to 6:00 
o'clock on June 12. True? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: And you didn't hear from O.J. Simpson during the time 6:00 to 
8:30 p.m.  Correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: But you did hear from O.J. Simpson around 9:00 o'clock p.m. on 
June 12. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Couple of hours before he was scheduled to be on an airplane.  
True? 
 
A: Correct.  In fact, I didn't hear from him for about l0 days prior to 
that because he was in Florida. 
 
Q: So the first time you had spoken to O.J. Simpson in about l0 days 
or so was about an hour before the murders occurred. 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Is that right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: In your opinion the murders occurred at 10:00 o'clock? 
 
A: I suppose what was said at the media, the time line were around 
10:30, 10:15, 10:00 o'clock.  I don't know. 
 
Q: Prior to -- by the way, let's talk about that telephone call since you 
have brought it up a number of times. 
 
You were watching this television show on a station that you don't 
remember the name of, on a station that you cannot recall. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you get a phone -- and you're home alone.  Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you get a phone call from O.J. Simpson. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How many times did the phone ring, by the way? 
 
A: Couple times.  The phone was right next to the couch. 
 
Q: You answered it.  You said "Hello."  What did he say? 
 
A: He said, "Christian, how you doing?  How you holding up?  I 
heard about Faye.  How you doing?" 
 
Q: What did you say? 
 
A: I said, "I'm hanging in there.  I'm just sitting at home preparing 
myself for tomorrow." 
 
Q: What did he say? 
 
A: He says, "Good, you got to just hang in there."  Kind of like that's 
the gist of the conversation. 
 
And I think he asked somebody over his shoulder, which I believe 
now must be Kato, what the scores were during the day on the 
football day, and that he's going to Chicago and he's going to be back 
Wednesday and that we should get together for dinner, and that 
Paula has a couple friends that are really cute and that will be great if 
we get together. 
 
Q: Meaning that you would be interested in Paula's friends? 
 
A: Yeah, that Paula has some friends and that would be great to have 
dinner with a few people. 
 
Q: What were the scores that he was asking Kato about? 
 
A: I don't know.  Must be football scores or -- 
 
Q: How do you know it was Kato? 
 
A: That's why I said I assume it was Kato. 
 
Q: What did he say to make you assume it was Kato? 
 
A: Well, I found out later, which makes me assume now that it was 
Kato, knowing that Kato was there at the time, but it was somebody 
who was -- he was very familiar with, saying, "Hey, what were the 
scores today?" 
 
Q: How did you find out it was Kato? 
 
A: Now we know that Kato spent time with him that evening.  At the 
time. 
 
Q: We do? 
 
A: Isn't that what Kato says? 
 
Q: News to me.  I don't know that. 
 
A: Well, they went out to have something to eat. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Red meat. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Red meat. 
 
THE WITNESS: Red meat, right after --  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Against your wishes.  Let me get this straight now.  At the time 
what did you hear Mr. Simpson say to make you think he was 
talking to another person? 
 
A: "What were the scores?"  Obviously, the sound changed. 
 
Q: What were the scores? 
 
A: I don't know.  I'm not interested in football.  I don't know. 
 
Q: In other words, you heard the level of his voice diminish, making 
you believe that he had taken the receiver away from his mouth 
while he was talking to someone else.  Correct? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the form. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Is that true? 
 
A: That's what it sounded like. 
 
Q: Could you tell whether he was on a cell phone or a regular phone? 
 
A: Sounded like pretty clear connection. 
 
Q: And you heard a TV in the background? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And could you hear that it was tuned into a sports event? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  And by the way, did he just in the middle of talking to you 
all of a sudden interrupt and ask this question about the scores? 
 
A: Yeah.  It was like we're talking about going for dinner, and he 
said, "Hold on a second," you know, something comes on television, 
"What were the scores?" 
 
Q: The scores? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And did you ask what scores he was talking about? 
 
A: I'm not interested in sports.  I don't... Doesn't mean much to me. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: For the record, we'll stipulate that proof that he 
doesn't know much about sports is the fact this was in June and he 
said it must have been football, is proof of that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I was going to get to that. 
 
Q: What did -- did O.J. ask you to go out to dinner?  You said, "We 
were talking about going for dinner." 
 
A: The Wednesday when he came back. 
 
Q: Okay. So are you pretty sure that told you that he was leaving 
town in that telephone call? 
 
A: Yeah. I know he said that he was packing his bags -- he was 
getting ready; he was packing his bag to get ready to go out of town. 
 
Q: Are you positive of that? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: So O.J. Simpson called you up and told you that he was packing 
his bags, getting ready to go out of town, and he told you this around 
9:00 p.m. on June 12.  True? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And he also told you that he was leaving that night on an airplane.  
True? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And he told you it was a red eye.  Right? 
 
A: I'm catching the 11:00 o'clock flight, or something. 
 
Q: 11:00 o'clock flight.  Okay.  To where? 
 
A: To Chicago. 
 
Q: He told you all that. 
 
A: When I asked him, you know -- he asked me, "How are you 
doing?"  I asked him, "What's up?  What are you doing?"  He says, 
"I'm packing my bag to go out of town." 
 
Q: By the way, did he ask you for any change? 
 
A: Any change? 
 
Q: For the skycap.  No? 
 
A: (No audible response.) 
 
Q: How long was this call? 
 
A: Probably seven, eight minutes.  You know, it was relatively brief, 
brief conversation, like just a -- 
 
Q: What was your phone number then? 
 
A: Same as now [Deleted telephone number] 
 
Q: What else did you talk about -- Did you say six to seven or seven 
to eight? 
 
A: Seven to eight. 
 
Q: What else did you talk about? 
 
A: That was about it.  He was telling me if Paula -- going for dinner, 
packing bags, Faye briefly being in rehab, hang in there.  That's it. 
 
Q: What did he say about Paula? 
 
A: Yeah, that she has some cute friends, that it will be great if we all 
get together for dinner. 
 
Q: Did he tell you that he and Paula had had an argument? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he tell you that Paula was pissed at him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You have found out since that Paula had ended their relationship 
at 7:00 in the morning on Sunday, the 12th.  Correct? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You may answer. 
 
A: I've heard, but I don't know what the accuracy of that is. 
 
Q: You haven't talked to O.J. Simpson about that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: He didn't tell you that that's what Paula testified to at her 
deposition? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Never discussed that subject at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he say anything to you about Paula other than that he is going 
to try to hook up with some of her friends and you when he gets back 
from Chicago? 
 
A: No.  That was it. 
 
Q: He said he'd be back Wednesday? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Have you ever related that conversation to anyone else? 
 
A: To Pavelick, Mr. Cochran. 
 
Q: Pavelick, Mr. Cochran. 
 
A: And I started to talk about that with Mr. Darden. 
 
Q: Darden. 
 
A: Dominick. 
 
Q: Dominick.  Dominick Rubalcava, your lawyer. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Anyone else? 
 
A: Probably [Name Deleted]. I think in my I deposition -- in my 
interview with Barbara Walters I talked about it briefly, I believe.  I 
don't make a habit of discussing things. 
 
Q: Did you write it down in your notes? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: When was the first time you wrote down the conversation that 
you just reported you had with O.J. Simpson on June 12? 
 
A: I think I made notes on that in December of '94. 
 
Q: After speaking to both Pavelick and Cochran.  Correct? 
 
A: Although they were not the incidents to prompt me to write those 
notes. 
 
Q: But you did write them after speaking to these two lawyers -- or 
these two representatives -- 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: -- of OJ. Simpson. 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: You mentioned the Barbara Walters interview.  I've had during 
the break a transcript of that interview marked as Exhibit 167 and 
asked you during the break to review the statements attributed to 
you.  Have you done so? 
 
A: Yeah, I glanced over them. 
 
Q: Are they accurate? 
 
A: On first view, yeah. 
 
Q: Did you tell the truth? 
 
A: Pretty accurate.  Oh, yes. 
 
Q: If you were under oath, would you have said anything different? 
 
A: That's right. 
 
Q: Would you have? 
 
A: No. Not only under oath.  
 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: Not only under oath. I just say the truth. 
 
Q: You told Barbara Walters the truth, is what I'm asking you.  
Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: The interview occurred on October 21, 1994? 
 
A: Yeah, I think that's what the date was. 
 
Q: And as you stated in the interview to Ms. Walters, O.J. Simpson 
asked you if you would be kind enough to come forward and speak 
on his behalf.  True? 
 
A: If I find inaccuracies with Faye's book, yes. 
 
Q: And you did. Right? 
 
A: I did in my time speaking to Mr. Darden or in that book. 
 
Q: So after Mr. Simpson asked you to come forward and speak on 
his behalf, you did so. Correct? 
 
A: Yes, you could put it like that. 
 
Q: And before he asked you to come forward and speak on your 
behalf, you had never come forward to speak to anyone publicly.  
True? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Have you told us everything that you can recall that was said in 
the conversation of June 12? 
 
A: With Mr. Simpson? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Have you ever discussed that conversation with him since he got 
out of jail? 
 
A: We talked about it briefly, but no -- you know, I don't go and, like 
I said, make a point of discussing it, anything about the case. 
 
Q: He might though.  True? 
 
A: I don't feed into it. 
 
Q: He might have a reason to talk to you about it.  
 
A: I think people want to clarify their own mind, go through 
questions in their own mind, so... 
 
Q: And O.J. Simpson has talked to you about it because in your view 
he wants to clarify in his own mind what was said.  Right? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Did you get his answer? His answer was 
"Right." 
 
THEWITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Now, have you left anything out of that conversation? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Nothing? 
 
A: No, I believe not. 
 
Q: Did you hear any person respond to Mr. Simpson's request about 
the scores while you were on the telephone with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: I take it that Mr. Simpson sounded normal to you on the 
telephone? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: In other words, he didn't sound gloomy.  Right? 
 
A: No.  If anything, he sounded more relieved. 
 
Q: Relieved. 
 
A: He was happy.  He seemed more relaxed.  He seemed more 
jovial. 
 
Q: So in your opinion, he didn't sound like someone who was just 
going to go out and kill somebody.  Right? 
 
A: Definitely not. 
 
Q: Definitely not.  Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: I take it, then, he told you nothing about going to the recital. 
 
A: No 
 
Q: And he told you nothing about Sydney Simpson.  Right? 
 
A: No.  He actually -- we did talk about something else, is that he had 
just come back from a trip with Paula and that it was nice to spend 
time with woman that he got along with very well. 
 
(Telephone interruption.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: In other words, in this conversation an hour or so before the 
murder of Nicole, O.J. Simpson is telling you how, in effect, happy 
he is to be seeing Paula.  True? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: True? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did he say about Paula in this conversation? 
 
A: Just like that one said -- he was saying that how nice it is to be 
with a lady that he gets along with very well. 
 
Q: And you understood that he was contrasting Paula with Nicole, in 
other words. Right? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: That's a fair statement. Right? 
 
A: Yes, that's a fair statement. 
 
Q: And Mr. Leonard doesn't want you to say that by his objections, 
but you are not going to let his objections influence you.  Right? 
 
A: Figure out what -- how to answer the question. 
 
MR. LEONARD: That's not a fair comment, Mr. Petrocelli. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I just want to make sure that you are not influenced and that your 
testimony doesn't come out I shaded or slanted because Mr. 
Simpson's lawyers are objecting.  Okay? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Thank you.  The objections are for the court to deal with, and the 
witnesses are not to be concerned with them. 
 
Did Mr. Simpson, by the way, tell you whether or not he would be 
here today? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, before I asked you if there was anything else that you had to 
add to the conversation.  You said there wasn't, but then you 
remembered the Paula -- 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: -- point.  Let me ask you again now:  Is there anything else that 
was said in that conversation? 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: So he didn't say anything about the recital. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And he didn't say anything about Sydney Simpson. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And having just seen her perform hours before. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And he didn't tell you that he had come all the way back from the 
East Coast to go see her perform.  Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  And he didn't tell you that he had just been in Connecticut 
and in New York.  Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And you didn't know any of that.  Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You hadn't spoken to him for at least two weeks. 
 
A: Yeah, 10 days, something like that. 
 
Q: And you knew nothing about his whereabouts from any other 
person either. True? 
 
A: Right. I thought he was in Florida during the time, for the whole 
time, or the East Coast. 
 
Q: Did you still think he was in Florida at the time of the phone call? 
 
A: No, no.  I knew that he was back at home. 
 
Q: How did you know that? 
 
A: Because I had the conversation with Nicole earlier in the day, 
about 4:30, 5:00, when she called me up to check on how I was 
feeling because of Faye.  She asked me whether I had seen Faye that 
day, and she was getting dressed to go to the recital. 
 
Q: But how did you know that O.J. Simpson called you from his 
house? 
 
A: I don't. 
 
Q: So you don't know where he was when he called you.  Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So he could have been out of town, for all you knew. 
 
A: Yeah.  Sounded like a very clear connection to me, so I assumed 
that he was there because I knew that he was gonna go to the recital 
from Nicole. 
 
Q: So you believed he was in Los Angeles. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And is it fair to say that based on the conversation you had with 
him at the time at 9:00 o'clock, you believed that he was at home at 
Rockingham at the time of the call? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: You talked about packing and television in the background, the 
whole thing.  Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Okay.  Now, tell me about this conversation with Nicole on the 
12th.  Is that the only time you talked to her that day? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when had you spoken to Nicole before June 12th? 
 
A: The Friday evening before, so it would be the 10th. 
 
Q: The 10th. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And when before the 10th? 
 
A: On Thursday morning, the day -- the morning after the 
intervention, because in the intervention Faye had agreed to go to the 
rehab, and then on the morning when she woke up she disagreed.  
She didn't want to go . So I called up the different people that were at 
the intervention to talk to Faye again, and Nicole was one of the 
people. 
 
Q: So you spoke to Nicole on Thursday, the morning of June -- 
 
A: 9th. 
 
Q: -- 9th.  Right?  Is that right? 
 
A: Right, should be the 9th, yeah. 
 
Q: And you spoke to Nicole only one time that day? 
 
A: Right, I believe so. 
 
Q: And the sole subject of that conversation was Faye Resnick and 
her going into rehab.  Right? 
 
A: Right, yeah. 
 
Q: How long -- Was it a phone call? 
 
A: It was a phone call. 
 
Q: How long did it last? 
 
A: Probably not more than a few minutes, because what I was trying 
to do is have everybody just talk to Faye and remind her of the 
promise that she made to everybody the night before. 
 
Q: How many times did you talk to Nicole on that day, June 9? 
 
A: I believe it was just that one time.  It was a pretty hectic morning. 
 
Q: Did you see her that day? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: On June l0, which is Friday -- 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: -- when did you speak to her on Friday? 
 
A: Later in the day, and it was concerning Francesca, what to do with 
Francesca and -- 
 
Q: Francesca is the daughter of -- 
 
A: Faye's daughter. 
 
Q: Faye's daughter? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Faye had already been taken to the rehabilitation center.  Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: What was the name of that place? 
 
A: Exodus. 
 
Q: Exodus. Part of Daniel Freeman Hospital? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you spoke to Nicole about the care of Francesca? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: You called Nicole? 
 
A: No. I think it was actually Nicole calling me. 
 
Q: To find out about Francesca? 
 
A: No. To find out how I was doing, how I was feeling. 
 
Q: How you were feeling. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: She called you where? 
 
A: At home. 
 
Q: What time was it? 
 
A: I don't recall. Probably between 8:00, 9:00 o'clock, something like 
that. 
 
Q: How long did that call last? 
 
A: Actually it was a pretty brief call because Nicole and I disagreed 
as to what to do with Francesca, and so -- 
 
Q: What did Nicole say? 
 
A: She said, "I don't want to deal with it," and she slammed down 
the phone. 
 
Q: Well, why don t you relate the conversation from beginning to 
end so we can better understand it. 
 
A: When I was at home that evening after visiting Faye, I believe it 
was Nicole who called me and wanted to know how I was doing, 
how are things going, and I approached the subject matter of 
Francesca, and Nicole basically said, "Look, I've got enough stuff to 
handle in my own house.  I don't want to get involved.  That's 
between Faye and you," and she hung up the phone. 
 
Q: Is that the first time she ever hung up on you? 
 
A: In that fashion, yeah. 
 
Q: What do you mean, "In that fashion"? 
 
A: Well, you know -- 
 
Q: Angrily? 
 
A: Angrily, yeah. 
 
Q: So that was the first time, on June 10, that Nicole had ever hung 
up on you angrily.  Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: You didn't get a word in edgewise, it sounds. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Very, very short conversation. 
 
A: Very brief conversation. 
 
Q: Did you know what Nicole was referring to, by the way, when she 
talked about what was going on in her life? 
 
A: I think she was very upset that Faye was at the rehab center.  I 
think that really -- that really distressed her. 
 
Q: In what way? 
 
A: In the hours before the intervention Nicole and Paul Resnick and I 
met, and Nicole was very distressed that Faye had deteriorated to 
that degree in her drug use again, and she felt partially responsible 
for letting her slip that far because she had been at Nicole's house for 
I guess the -- since the end of March and free-basing at Nicole's 
house. 
 
So I had asked Nicole that evening as to why didn't she come to me 
earlier than June 8th, that Wednesday, to tell me about it, and she 
said that she and Faye thought that Faye could handle it. 
 
Q: The free-basing? 
 
A: Right.  So Nicole felt pretty distressed about not having brought it 
to anybody's attention earlier. 
 
Q: And because she was distressed, she hung up on you? 
 
A: No.  I thought -- yeah.  On that Friday night? 
 
Q: (Nods head.) 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: So her stress was in your view caused by what happened to her 
friend Faye. 
 
A: Right.  Right. And she didn't want to get in between the 
discussions between Faye and I about Francesca. 
 
Q: What did you want to do with Francesca? 
 
A: I was trying to figure out what the best thing would be. 
 
Q: Did you want Nicole to take her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Who did you want to take her? 
 
A: I was contemplating taking her. 
 
Q: Did you take her? 
 
A: Actually, the first few days she went to Paul's house, and so I was 
trying to figure out a schedule for my work to rearrange it around 
Francesca's school time so that I could take care of her. 
 
Q: That never eventuated? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Is that the only call or contact you had with Nicole on June 10? 
 
A: That Friday, yes.  Not -- and I didn't talk to her until that Sunday. 
 
Q: Now, on June 11 did you try to get in touch with her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you leave her any messages? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you get any messages? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you get any messages from O.J. Simpson at all the week 
before the murder? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: The week of the murder? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you have an answering machine at that time? 
 
A: Yeah. I have a phone service.  Not a machine at home, but, you 
know, with the phone company. 
 
Q: What do you mean by that? 
 
A: What do you call it, phone service? 
 
Q: Voice mail? 
 
A: Voice mail, yeah. 
 
Q: So if someone were to call you and leave a message, they could 
do so on a voice mail and you could pick up that message from 
anywhere? 
 
A: That's right. 
 
Q: And then save it or erase it? 
 
A Right. 
 
Q: You hadn't had any messages from O.J. Simpson for a long time 
before the murders.  Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: In fact you can't remember the last time you had a message from 
him on your voice mail before the murder.  Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Had you ever? 
 
A: Oh. yeah. 
 
Q: So you made no attempt to contact Nicole on the 11th even 
though she hung up on you.  Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And on the 12th did you call her? 
 
A: Which would be the Sunday? 
 
Q: Sunday. 
 
A: No.  I believe also it was her calling me, checking on how I was 
and -- 
 
Q: What time did she call? 
 
A: About 5:00, 5:30, right around that time, because she was getting 
ready -- dressed for the recital. 
 
Q: And relate that conversation. 
 
A: She called me to find out again how I was doing and that she felt 
sorry about having hung up on me that Friday night like that, and she 
asked whether I saw Faye. 
 
I told her Faye was doing decent, and she said she just wanted to 
check.  She's getting dressed, you know -- I could hear on the phone 
she was kind of hurrying around -- to go to the recital, and I said,. 
"I'll talk to you later.  Have fun." 
 
Q: What recital? 
 
A: Of Sydney's. 
 
Q: How did you know about Sydney's recital? 
 
A: Nicole told me about it. 
 
Q: When? 
 
A: That day.  She's on the way to recital of Sydney's. 
 
Q: Did you know what she was referring to when she first brought it 
up? Had you heard about it before? 
 
A: I know that a recital was going to come up in the next few weeks, 
so when I was -- when Nicole told me, then I remembered that there 
was going to be a recital for Sydney. 
 
Q: Was there any conversation about O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: Yeah, she mentioned that O.J.'s going to be back in town. 
 
Q: What did Nicole tell you about Mr. Simpson in this 5:00 
conversation on June 12th? 
 
A: That he's going to be back there later. 
 
Q: Back where? 
 
A: Back in L.A.  He's going to be back to come to the recital. 
 
Q: Which was supposed to start momentarily.  Right?  You said it's 
5:00? 
 
A: Right.  I don't know exactly what time the recital started. 
 
Q: But she said Mr. Simpson was already in town or was coming 
into town?  What did she say to you? 
 
A: "He's going to be there." 
 
Q: At the recital. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: What did that have to do with the rest of the conversation?  
Anything? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah. "What's happening?  What's going on?  
Who's at the recital? What" -- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You asked, "Who's at the recital?" 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Did you ask any questions about O.J.? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you say anything about Paula? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you say, "Will Paula be there?" 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Who brought up O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: I think it was when I asked, "Who's gonna be there?"  She said, 
"Well O.J.'s going to come, too."  The Fischmans were there, their 
family's there.  It's like when you talk to a friend, "You going to a 
recital? Who's going to be there, What's up?" and the other person 
answers. 
 
Q: Did she tell you about what her plans were following the recital? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Is that the best you can do in terms of what was said? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Can't recall anything else? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you related that conversation to anyone? 
 
A: Yeah. I believe I related to Mr. Pavelick and Mr. Cochran and at 
some point Dominick. 
 
Q: Now, who was the first person you ever related the O.J. Simpson 
conversation to on the evening of June 12th, that conversation? 
 
A: I believe it was the first time that I related to anybody was to the 
two detectives that took my statement a week and a half after the 
murder. 
 
Q: And the same thing about this other conversation that you just 
talked about with Nicole? 
 
A: Yeah.  So I most likely talked to the two detectives about that 
call. 
 
Q: Now, was that the last time you ever spoke to Nicole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was around 5:00 on June 12, 1994? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Now, at that moment in time did you know of a single person 
who you believed wanted to kill her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or who would have any reason to kill her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: As of that moment in time, were you aware of anyone who ever 
said he or she would kill Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Had anyone ever told you about anybody who said they might 
want to kill Nicole? Yes or no. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And who was that? 
 
A: That was Faye. 
 
Q: And who was the person that Faye said would kill Nicole -- 
excuse me. Who was the person that Faye said said he would kill 
Nicole? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Objection. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Can we -- do you understand the question? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Vague -- 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Wait a second. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Vague and leading, compound. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Okay.  Do you understand the question? 
 
THE WITNESS: I think I understand what Mr. Petrocelli is leading 
at. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I am sure you do. 
 
A: That's why I say it's not a question that could be answered with 
yes or 
no. 
 
Q: Oh, please try your best. 
 
A: If I answer yes, then it would be construed one way.  If it's not -- 
 
Q: You don't need to worry how it will be construed because there 
are lots of very talented lawyers, far more talented than I, who will 
make sure that it doesn't get misconstrued. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Is Mr. Medvene going to help us there? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I don't know.  You'll have to ask him. 
 
Q: So answer my question, please.  Had anyone ever told you that 
someone had said that he or she would kill Nicole, as of June 12, 
1994? 
 
A: As a figure of speech or as a -- 
 
Q: Kidding around, figure of speech, dead serious, in the middle of a 
confession to a priest, any statement in any context. 
 
A: Kidding around, figure of speech, yes, Faye Resnick told me that 
O.J. had said to her once he's gonna kill her. 
 
Q: Okay. So the only utterance about someone killing Nicole that 
you had ever heard in your entire life as of June 12, 1994 was 
through Faye Resnick that O.J. Simpson said he would kill Nicole.  
True? 
 
A: No, not necessarily true, because Faye might have said at some 
point, "I'm going to kill her if she does that."  Cora might have said -- 
 
Q: I am only talking about what you had heard. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Not what might have happened in the world.  I mean, maybe lots 
of people said things. 
 
A: As I'm recalling the conversations now, yes, that was the only one 
that distinctively, as you're asking for it, is in my mind. 
 
Q: What is the only one? 
 
A: The phone conversation that Faye had with O.J. 
 
Q: Okay.  So Faye had a conversation with O.J. Simpson, and O.J. 
Simpson told Faye that he was going to kill Nicole, and Faye told 
that to you, and that's the only one that you were aware of as of June 
12.  True? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: True? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: May I expand on that? 
 
Q: Well, we'll get to it.  Earlier in your testimony you said that we all 
know now that it was Kato to whom O.J. was asking about the scores 
because we all know that Kato was with O.J. at 9:00 p.m. on the 
evening of June 12.  Now, I want to ask you about that.  How do you 
know that to be a fact? 
 
A: Let's put it -- let me rephrase it, then.  I assumed that it was Kato. 
 
Q: Has anyone ever told you that it was Kato? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever asked O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever say, OJ., when you called me at 9:00 o'clock, who 
was that person that you asked about for the scores?"  Did you ever 
ask him that question? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever say, "Wait a second.  He might be your alibi"? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You never thought of asking that question? 
 
A: No, because later I found out that -- I heard that Kato went with 
him to get something to eat, so I assumed it was Kato. 
 
Q: How did you find out that Kato went with him to get something 
to eat? 
 
A: Well, it's pretty much in the papers. 
 
Q: Had you ever gone out to eat with O.J. Simpson before June 
12th? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: A number of times? 
 
A: Number of times, yeah. 
 
Q: Did you ever go to McDonald's with him? 
 
A: No.  I refused. 
 
Q: Did you ever -- did he ever insist? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever go to a McDonald's -- Withdrawn.  You've never 
gone to McDonald's 
with O.J. Simpson, I take it.  True? 
 
A: I've taken him to -- actually, not a McDonald's.  A Burger King, I 
believe it is. 
 
Q: When was that? 
 
A: Couple of months ago. 
 
Q: Okay. Why did you do that? 
 
A: He wanted to go for a ride.  We had some time.  I took him down 
there. 
 
Q: Down where? 
 
A: To a Burger King on Santa Monica Boulevard and Barrington. 
 
Q: Now, did this have anything to do with reconstructing the events 
of his activities on June 12? 
 
A: No.  It was a milk shake run. 
 
Q: And he didn't have anything.  Right? 
 
A: He had a milk shake. 
 
Q: Okay.  So you never before June 12 went to a McDonald's with 
O.J. Simpson.  Right? Whether or not he ate or you ate, never been 
to one, even in a drive-through.  Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: True? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Have you ever been to a fast-food restaurant with him? 
 
A: No, I don't believe so. 
 
Q: Had you ever seen O.J. Simpson gulp down a hamburger in a car? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you know what size shoe O.J. Simpson wore as of June 12th? 
 
A: No idea. 
 
Q: You pay attention to things like that, shoe size, feet size, don't 
you, as a chiropractor, whether he had big feet, little feet? 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: He's not a podiatrist. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Close enough. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: No? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know whether he ever owned any Bruno Magli shoes? 
 
A: I have no idea. 
 
Q: No idea one way or the other? 
 
A: Right. I don't check what shoes people wear.  I really don't know. 
 
Q: You might not check, but you might know anyway.  Someone 
might tell you. "Hey, look at these Brunos," you know. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So you have no knowledge or information about his shoes.  
Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You saw the shoes that were worn -- excuse me.  You saw the 
shoes that were depicted at trial to be the Bruno Magli shoes? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You didn't see those? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You wouldn't know what they looked like? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You saw those gloves that the prosecutor contended were the 
gloves of O.J. Simpson, the murder gloves? 
 
A: Yeah.  I just saw -- I flipped on the television about it. 
 
Q: And did you know one way or the other whether they were O.J. 
Simpson's gloves? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So they could have been, but you wouldn't know.  Right? 
 
A: Right, exactly. 
 
Q: In this conversation with Paul Resnick, did you and he discuss 
anything about O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: 10:00 o'clock on the morning of June 13? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Nothing? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: His name didn't come up? 
 
A: Not at all.  In fact, Paul was very worried that this was a drug-
related situation.  That was the gist of his focus: "Do we have to get 
Faye out of town?" 
 
Q: Weren't you concerned for your friend, Mr. Simpson, whose wife 
had just been murdered -- or his ex-wife? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Didn't you ask.  "Does O.J. know?"  That didn't even come up? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or, "What about his children?"  None of that came up? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did the thought cross your mind, by the way, that he might be 
responsible for this, in that conversation when you first heard about 
Nicole's death? 
 
A: Not at all.  The -- 
 
Q: Did it cross your mind but you immediately excluded it? 
 
A: No it never even crossed my mind, but the immediate attention 
was that if this is a drug hit, then does Faye have to leave town. 
 
Q: When you heard about the death of Nicole, did you hear about 
how the death occurred? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you hear about there was another person involved? 
 
A: No, not until later that day. 
 
Q: What did you hear later that day? 
 
A: I think I was driving to my office in Malibu and I listened to the 
news, and it was that Nicole and a young man had been murdered. 
 
Q: And when was it that you first found out the name of that young 
man? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: When you first heard that it was a man named Ron Goldman, did 
that name mean anything to you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Had you ever heard that name before? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Had you ever seen anybody who bore the resemblance of the 
person whose pictures you saw as Ron Goldman? 
 
A: No.  No. 
 
Q: And looking back now, do you know whether you've ever seen 
Ron Goldman while he was alive? 
 
A: I doubt it. 
 
Q: And Faye never mentioned him to you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or anybody.  Is that right? 
 
A: Yeah, that's right. 
 
Q: Now, when you heard that Nicole had been killed, other than 
drive off to your office in Malibu, did you do anything? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: What did do you? 
 
A: I called the Exodus Rehab Center and related to the head of the 
center that I talked to -- I asked him for advice.  I asked him what to 
do. 
 
Q: What did he say? 
 
A: I asked him whether I should come down there and to talk to 
Faye, and he said, "Well, we're the professionals here, so let us 
handle it."  He took down my phone number where I was gonna be, 
and he asked me to be available for him. 
 
Q: Did he already know about Nicole's death? 
 
A: No.  I told him. 
 
Q: Did you expect that he then would inform Faye? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Were you going to be there when Faye was told? 
 
A: Well, he said they're going to talk to her, being the professionals 
there, and I said, "Well, I'll keep myself available for" -- 
 
Q: What did you tell this person?  First of all, what is the name of 
this person? 
 
A: I don't remember right now. 
 
Q: What did you tell this person about the way that Nicole had been 
killed? 
 
A: I just said that Nicole had been killed, because that's all I knew. 
 
Q: But you knew it wasn't a car accident.  Right? You knew it was a 
murder. Right? 
 
A: Yeah, Paul said that she was murdered at her house.  So that was 
it. 
 
Q: You didn't know if it was a gunshot, a knife wound or whatever.  
Right? 
 
A: No, I had no idea. 
 
Q: So you didn't pass any information on to this person. Right? 
 
A: No.  His name was Albert. 
 
Q: Albert.  What did you do then after your call with Albert? 
 
A: I went to my office in Malibu. 
 
Q: And then what was your next contact regarding this situation? 
 
A: I think my next contact was that later that afternoon -- later that 
evening I went to Exodus. 
 
Q: Had you spoken to anyone in between? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Had you gained any additional information? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Had you learned that O.J. Simpson was a suspect? 
 
A: No, not at that time. 
 
Q: Now, when you went to Exodus, did you see Faye? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did you see her alone? 
 
A: Was I alone in the room with her? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Briefly. 
 
Q: Did you go with anyone? 
 
A: No.  I went by myself. 
 
Q: Did you bring Francesca? 
 
A: No. Francesca was at Paul's.  We had arranged -- Paul and I had 
arranged for him to pick up Francesca at school. 
 
Q: When?  The end of the school day? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Paul called you in the morning.  Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: So I take it, then, that neither you nor Paul thought there was any 
threat to Francesca's security such that she had to be removed from 
school.  True? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And Francesca remained with Paul the remaining -- the ensuing 
days? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: When you went to Exodus, did you first before seeing Faye talk 
to anyone about whether Faye had been informed of Nicole's death? 
 
A: Yeah, I went to see Albert first. 
 
Q: And what did Albert say to you? 
 
A: Albert said that Faye basically freaked out. 
 
Q: Did Albert tell you what Faye had said when informed of Nicole's 
death? 
 
A: No.  He was -- he said that she was running through the center 
screaming, yelling. 
 
Q: Did Albert tell you that Faye had said anything about O.J. 
Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Albert tell you that Faye had immediately said when told of 
Nicole's death, "O.J. did it.  OJ. killed her.  He said he would and he 
did"? 
 
A: No.  Faye said that later to me. 
 
Q: Do you believe Faye made that up? 
 
A: Yeah, I do.  Hold on.  Let me clarify.  That she made up what? 
 
Q: Do you believe that Faye made up the fact that she, when told of 
Nicole's death, immediately told the counselors who informed her 
that "OJ. Simpson did it"-- 
 
MR.LEONARD: Object -- 
 
BY MR.PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: -- "he said he would and he did"?  Do you believe she made that 
up? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the form of the question. 
 
THE WITNESS: I believe that Faye was very paranoid at the time, 
and I think that -- 
 
BY MR.PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: That's not my question.  My question is:  Regardless of whatever 
motives you might ascribe to Faye or why she may do something, 
my question is simply whether you believe that Faye actually said to 
the counselors, when told of Nicole's death, "O.J. did it." 
 
A: Yeah, if -- 
 
Q: Do you believe that? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Object.  Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: If -- how do I say that.  If the counselors at this 
point say that that's what she said, then chances are that that's what 
she said. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Okay.  That's what I'm asking you. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: You don't have any reason to believe that that did not occur if 
everyone said it occurred.  Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: When you talked to Faye and -- well, when you spoke to Faye, did 
you already know by that time that O.J. Simpson was a suspect? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you know anything at all about O.J. Simpson's involvement 
in this in terms of whether the police were looking for him or even 
talking to him or questioning him, or had you seen him on television, 
anything? 
 
A: I don't believe so because I went straight from my of office down 
to Exodus, so -- 
 
Q: What time did you get to Exodus? 
 
A: Oh, about 7:00 o'clock. 
 
Q: In the evening? 
 
A: In the evening. 
 
Q: And you had heard no reports about O.J. Simpson by then? 
 
A: I went from my office in the morning to the office, saw my 
patients and drove down to Exodus.  I don't listen to the radio during 
the day.  I don't stop and buy a paper or -- 
 
Q: Your patients didn't talk to you about it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you spoke to Faye, did she say anything to you about O.J. 
Simpson? 
 
A: She said that she believes that O.J. killed Nicole. 
 
Q: She was still upset when you saw her.  Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay.  And it was just the two of you alone? 
 
A: Actually we were sitting out in the courtyard because Faye, she 
was extremely frantic. 
 
Q: And when she said that she thought O.J. Simpson killed Nicole, 
what did you say? 
 
A: I said, "Well, what makes you think that?"  You know, I tried to 
stay calm and relaxed and tried to accommodate her franticness. 
 
Q: Now, was her statement to you that O.J. Simpson killed Nicole 
the first time that that thought had ever entered your mind: When 
someone else had mentioned it to you? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And that was the first person who mentioned it? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: What did you say to her? 
 
A: I tried to comfort her.  I didn't believe it.  I did not believe it.  It 
wasn't even in my mind right now who did what.  It was like there's 
this woman who is absolutely frantic.  How do we take care of that 
right now. 
 
Q: And I think you said a moment ago that you asked her, "Why do 
you think that?" 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And what did she say to you? 
 
A: She said, "I think he did it.  I think O.J. did it."  And I said, "What 
makes you think that?"  You know, it's like what -- try to kind of -- 
instead of her being all frantic, to try to draw out -- 
 
Q: And what did she say? 
 
A: And she said, "Well, he told me on the phone once." 
 
Q: Told her what? 
 
A: That he's gonna kill her. 
 
Q: And what did you say? 
 
A: Well, I said, you know, 'That conversation was not the way that it 
happened, that you're perceiving it, and relax and try to get some 
sleep," and just try to mellow her out. 
 
Q: Were you able to? 
 
A: No.  No way.  What people don't understand, if somebody is four 
days into drug rehab, you know. they're not calm. 
 
Q: Did you and she have any conversation then about any details or 
information concerning Nicole's activities on the 12th or the 11th or 
O.J. Simpson's activities, any conversation about that? 
 
A: No.  It wasn't really possible to have a conversation with her. 
 
Q: Did she ask you whether you had talked to Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: What was it? 
 
Q: Did she ask you whether you had spoken to -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- Mr. Simpson?  After you left her -- How long were you with 
her? 
 
A: About half an hour, 45 minutes. 
 
Q: Did you talk about Francesca? 
 
A: Yeah, I mentioned to her that I had talked to Paul, that Francesca 
is taken care of, that Francesca is at Paul's house. 
 
Q: Did you tell her that Paul Resnick had said this might be a drug 
hit? 
 
A: I mentioned it to her the day later. 
 
Q: Not that day. 
 
A: Not that day. 
 
Q: The next time you spoke to her was the next day? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Did you ask her any questions the first day -- this is the evening of 
the 13th -- about drug people? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: After you left the Exodus treatment center, did you do anything 
else the remainder of that evening concerning -- 
 
A: Just went home. 
 
Q: Did you talk to anyone? 
 
A: I don't think I talked to anyone. I was shocked.  I was just -- 
 
Q: Did you call the Brown family? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Had you called the Simpson family? 
 
A: No.  I think -- I believe I talked to Kris Jenner. 
 
Q: When? 
 
A: That evening. 
 
Q: That evening? 
 
A: That evening, yeah. 
 
Q: Did Kris tell you that O.J. Simpson was a suspect or that the cops 
were questioning him? 
 
A: No.  When I come home, I turned on the television to listen to the 
news. 
 
Q: And what did you hear? 
 
A: That the police -- that O.J. was down at the police station for an 
interview. 
 
Q: Now, did that shock you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: It didn't shock you that this person was being questioned for his 
involvement in the death of Nicole? 
 
A: I don't believe that that day it was questioned of his involvement.  
I believe he was questioned whether he knew anything. 
 
Q: I see.  So you still had no idea that he was a suspect. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And then you went to bed? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: By the way, didn't Kris Jenner tell you that he was a suspect? 
 
A: I don't believe at that time anybody thought he was a suspect. 
 
Q: She didn't say anything to you about that in that conversation? 
 
A: No.  Actually, in fact, if anything, over the next day or two after 
the murder Kris Jenner, Bruce Jenner, me, we thought that it was a 
drug hit, because they were asking, "Is Faye safe where she's at?"  
They were talking about could this possibly be a drug hit. 
 
Q: Did you pick up the phone to tell the police that you thought that 
Nicole's killer was drug related? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you have any information, any evidence,. anything at all to 
indicate that Nicole's killing might have been drug related? 
 
A:  Just the fact that, you know, Faye had been involved in drug use 
at Nicole's house and knew Faye didn't have any money at the time.  
When Nicole told me that Faye had been free-basing at her house, to 
me, I went, "Oh my God, where did she get the money for that?  
How long had she been doing this?  Three months, or two and a half 
months?  How did she afford that?"  You know, to me the question 
was, if this has been going on for this time, what are the implications 
that now Nicole is dead. Who could have had possibly any interest in 
-- 
 
Q: Why would you in any way connect up Faye Resnick owing drug 
lords money to Nicole's death? 
 
A: Well, I think it's a pretty sensible thought process when you're 
standing there, you just brought the lady that you're seeing into a 
rehab center, like I said, all those different things are going on in 
your head, that the woman -- the person that was the friend that she 
had stayed with over the last X number of months gets found killed -- 
 
Q: Why wouldn't the person killed have been Faye Resnick?  Why 
Nicole? 
 
A: Because Faye was in rehab. 
 
Q: But they could have killed Faye on June 8 or June 7 or June 6 or 
May 31 or -- 
 
A: Yeah, they could have. 
 
Q: -- or any time. 
 
A: Could have. 
 
Q: But what I don't understand about your thought process is:  What 
did any of that have to do with Nicole? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection. You are asking him to speculate. 
 
THE WITNESS: That's the question, you know, but in the moment -- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Faye Resnick also stayed with you during this three-month 
period. Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you were not killed. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: I was extremely worried after that. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: She also stayed with [Name Deleted] for a night or two.  Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And [Name Deleted] wasn't killed. 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: But she wasn't spending four or five nights a week 
at either place.  She was spending four or five nights a week at 
Nicole's house and -- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: When you found out how Nicole was killed, that she had been 
brutally stabbed and slashed, did you still think it was a drug hit at 
that time? 
 
A: That's what made me even consider it more. 
 
Q: And why is that? 
 
A: Just because of the -- to me that was the only option.  To me it 
was much more -- it was the only option that I could think about:  
Why would anybody do that. 
 
Q: You mean your thought process was that Nicole was brutally 
slashed and stabbed by an assailant with a knife who mistakenly 
believed that person being killed was Faye? 
 
A: No. Because in the two-month period of time Nicole and Faye 
had been going out a lot; Nicole had been drinking a lot; the two 
girls were out a lot.  So we didn't know, especially then after Nicole 
had come and told me about Faye's drug use, actually free-basing at 
her house, then I all of a sudden realized that, you know, this was not 
prescription medication, as Faye had led me to believe all along.  
Faye was back smoking. 
 
Q: At any point in time had you acquired any information that Nicole 
gave money to drug people for drugs? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: At any point in time had you come across any information that 
Nicole herself had any contact with any person who sold drugs? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Can we take a break?  We've been going for a 
little bit.  The reporter, I am sure, is tired.  I need to make a phone 
call to my office. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Fine. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Thank you. 
 
(Recess.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Getting back to the conversation you had with Faye at Exodus on 
the evening of June 13, did you and she discuss that Francesca was 
okay? 
 
A: Right.  I let her know that Francesca is with Paul. 
 
Q: And that she was safe and secure? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Was Faye concerned about that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she ask about Francesca? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you tell her about Francesca? 
 
A: I tried to give her information to calm her down. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you tell her you would be back to see her? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, at this point in time you and she were still together.  Right? 
 
A: I felt that having brought her to the rehab center for the second 
time and paid for the rehabilitation, that I had done my due diligence 
for that relationship, and that was it for me. 
 
In fact, the day -- the Saturday -- the first Saturday that she was in 
rehab in a group session, one of the counselors engaged Faye and I in 
a conversation, and we agreed that that's it. 
 
Q: Before you took Faye to the rehab center, had you and she 
discussed splitting up? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And had you officially split up? 
 
A: No, but we had started to live very, very separate lives. 
 
Q: Her primary residence was still with you. Right? 
 
A: Approximately a week or so before, she basically took a bunch of 
her things to Nicole's house, before the intervention. 
 
Q: And had she returned to your house? 
 
A: Throughout the day when I was at work. 
 
Q: She would come -- 
 
A: She would come in the day, do some things, get some things, and 
then in the evening when I was home, she wasn't there. 
 
Q: When was the last time she slept at your home before Nicole's 
death? 
 
A: I think it was the night of the intervention. 
 
Q: June 9? 
 
A: June 9, a Wednesday. 
 
Q: Before June 9 when was the last time? 
 
A: I believe it was Friday -- Thursday or Friday the week before, 
which would be -- 
 
Q: Why don't you use the calendar. 
 
A: That would be the 2nd or the 3rd of June. 
 
Q: And before then when was the last time she slept there? 
 
A: Probably the days before there -- before then. 
 
Q: So the days that she didn't sleep at the house when she moved out, 
so to speak, were between June -- 
 
A: 2nd. 
 
Q: -- 3 and June 9.  Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: So a period of about five days. 
 
A: Right.  That's when I asked her to not be there when I'm there. 
 
Q: And then June 8 she slept at your place? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And then June 9 you took her to Exodus.  Right? 
 
A: Right.  She was going to stay -- I was going to leave out of town 
June 8th to go on a trip for four days, and she was going to stay at 
the house during that period of time. 
 
Q: June 8 to what? 
 
A: 8th through the 12th. 
 
Q: You didn't take that trip? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Because of her going into Exodus? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Was that a business trip? 
 
A: No. Motorcycle trip. 
 
Q: Motorcycle trip? 
 
A: (Nods head.) 
 
Q: Every year that time of year? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: That exact weekend. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That exact -- 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: That exact weekend. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
Q: Okay.  So this was a big event for you to miss. 
 
A: Definitely. 
 
Q: What did you do the next day, on the 14th? 
 
A: Tuesday. I was going to visit Faye in the morning.  I worked in 
the afternoons from about 1:00 until 7:00, so that's when I would see 
patients, and I would -- probably went to see Faye the Tuesday 
morning because that Tuesday evening I went to an Al-Anon 
meeting, as per the suggestion of Albert who heads the Exodus 
center. 
 
Q: And when you saw Faye in the morning, did you spend some 
time with her? 
 
A: I probably brought her some things, but probably didn't spend a 
lot of time with her. 
 
Q: Was there any discussion about Nicole's death? 
 
A: I don't really recall that day very much. 
 
Q: And by that time did you know that O.J. Simpson was a suspect? 
 
A: I knew that at that time that he was called in to talk on that 
Monday afternoon, but I don't recall whether he was a suspect or not. 
 
Q: Had you spoken to any member of his family? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or the Brown family? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  And after you met Faye in the morning, what did you do 
in relation to Nicole's death? 
 
A: Went to work and went to the meeting. 
 
Q: And that evening? 
 
A: After the meeting' 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Just probably went home. 
 
Q: And the next day is the 15th. 
 
A: The next day is the 15th.  I see patients in the morning, had a 
appointment with a patient -- 
 
Q: You are looking at your calendar, for the record -- 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: -- Exhibit 168.  Continue. 
 
A: Right.  Talked to my cousin later that afternoon. 
 
Q: Who is your cousin? 
 
A: Christa Oetjen, O-e-t-j-e-n. 
 
Q: And what is her phone number? 
 
A: [Deleted telephone number] 
 
Q: She works in Los Angeles and lives here? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did you discuss with her anything about O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: I certainly did. yeah. 
 
Q: What did you say? 
 
A: I talked to her about Nicole's death and I talked to her about Faye 
being in rehab, you know, just trying to relate some of my thoughts 
to her. 
 
Q: Now, by this time did you know that O.J. was a suspect? 
 
A: It's really difficult for me to discern what point I became aware 
that the police considered him a suspect. 
 
Q: When is that point? 
 
A: I think it probably was in the day before the funeral. 
 
Q: What was it?  Just a media report? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Now, when you heard that -- Well, let me back up again.  Finish 
off what you did in relation to Mr. Simpson on the 15th. 
 
A: Actually, I was going to a concert that evening, but I didn't go. 
 
Q: Did you talk to any of Nicole's friends?  Cora Fischman, Cici 
Shahian? 
 
A: Probably Kris Jenner -- Kris Jenner and Bruce Jenner were 
probably the only two people that I talked to about this case in that 
time. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: Might have briefly talked to Paul about Francesca, called over to 
Paul's house about Francesca, but that's it. 
 
Q: Was anybody developing any information to support this idea of 
yours that this was a drug hit? 
 
A: Well, I think in those days still Kris, Bruce, Paul, everybody 
thought that that's -- that was what happened. 
 
Q: But there was no information to support that. True? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: True? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Before the break I was asking you some questions about contacts 
Nicole had with people involved in drugs, and you were not aware of 
any.  Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Prior to June 12 --Withdrawn.  Have you become aware of any 
information that Nicole herself was free-basing? 
 
A: Nicole-free-basing, no.  Nicole admitted in the intervention that 
she had used cocaine with Faye at a couple opportunities, couple 
times. 
 
Q: But no free-basing. 
 
A: No free-basing.  And the word ''free-basing'' wasn't specifically 
used. 
 
Q: Now, at the intervention did it come up that Faye had been free-
basing? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And the purpose of the intervention was to intervene in Faye's life 
and try to get her some help.  Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And in that vein, she was confronted by you and her friends, 
including Nicole, to urge her to do so.  Right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And her drug use was discussed, and she was forced to admit it.  
Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you got her to admit that she had been free-basing? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Since how long? 
 
A: Nicole admitted in that intervention that it had been about three 
days before the trip to Cabo, which was Easter. 
 
Q: Give me the dates of the Cabo trip from looking at Exhibit 168, 
your calendar. 
 
A: April 1 -- I went April 1 through the 4th, '94. 
 
Q: And when did Faye go to Cabo? 
 
A: I think Nicole, Faye and the kids left the day before me. 
 
Q: So 3-31? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And when did they return? 
 
A: They returned the -- I believe the 8th. 
 
Q: Okay.  And in the intervention Nicole said that Faye's free-basing 
began when? 
 
A: Three days before their trip to Cabo. 
 
Q: So around March 28th? 
 
A: Around March 28, yes. 
 
Q: And continued through the date of the intervention, which was 
June 7th.  Right? 
 
A: 8th. 
 
Q: Excuse me.  June 8th. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Now, did she -- did Nicole indicate how frequently Faye was free-
basing? 
 
A: No. She didn't say whether it was a daily thing, but she had 
contacted Faye's ex-husband, Paul Resnick, who contacted me on 
Wednesday, the 8th, and to have a meeting with him and Nicole on 
Wednesday, the 8th, in the evening, and in that meeting Nicole, like I 
said, was very distressed on how Faye had degenerated and that the 
free-basing has become a big problem. 
 
Q: But no indication was made how often she would free-base? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And in what quantities. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was there any other drug use described besides free-basing? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What about Faye's taking of pills? 
 
A: No, that -- well, I brought up that part; Nicole didn't bring up that 
part, because I was under the impression that Faye in those weeks -- 
actually two months had been using prescription medication since 
her surgery -- 
 
Q: Which was? 
 
A: Which was March 18th. 
 
Q: Surgery for what? 
 
A: Breast augmentation. 
 
Q: Who performed that surgery?  Do you know? 
 
A: Koplin, Dr. Koplin, Larry Koplin. 
 
Q: And what kind of medication was Faye taking following the 
breast surgery? 
 
A: Pain medication. 
 
Q: What was the type of medication? 
 
A: I don't know the name of the medication, but I know that later I 
found vials of Percodan, Valium prescribed, and I had found some 
vials at the house. 
 
Q: After she left? 
 
A: No.  Before she left. 
 
Q: Percodan, Valium. 
 
A: Fiorinals. 
 
Q: Was there any discussion at the intervention of how much, if any, 
of these pills Faye was taking? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And was there any discussion of her doing anything else? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And did Nicole say that she had been doing drugs? 
 
A: She had -- Faye said that she will only admit to go to a rehab 
center if Nicole would go also, and Faye had asked Nicole to go for 
alcohol, and when confronted with the -- basically what Faye did is 
she tried to blame everybody else in the room and she said, "Well, 
Nicole, you've done it with me."  And Nicole said, "Well, I've only 
snorted" -- "I've only used it a couple times with you." 
 
Q: Used cocaine? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Couple of times. 
 
A: Couple of times. 
 
Q: Over what period of time? 
 
A: Over those months. 
 
Q: How do you know it was those months? 
 
A: That was the inferring. 
 
Q: But she didn't say it was in those months. 
 
A: No. No. 
 
Q: So Nicole said. "I've only used cocaine a couple of times with 
you." 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Correct? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And was there a discussion of any other drug use by Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And was there discussion of alcohol use by Nicole? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: At the intervention? 
 
A: At the intervention. 
 
Q: And what was said in that regard? 
 
A: That Nicole was drinking way too much in the last three months, 
four months. 
 
Q: Who said that? 
 
A: Faye did. 
 
Q: What did Nicole say about that? 
 
A: She said, "You're right." 
 
Q: Did either Nicole or Faye indicate how much Nicole was 
drinking? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And how often? 
 
A: It was just discussed that Nicole was drinking a lot of tequila 
when they were going out. 
 
Q: A lot of tequila? 
 
A: (Nods head.) 
 
Q: You're shaking your head. 
 
A: Yeah, a lot of tequila. 
 
Q: You understand the reporter can't pick up a shake of the head, 
only audible sounds. 
 
A: Great. Okay. 
 
Q: At the intervention was there any discussion of how much money 
had been spent to acquire the drugs that Faye was using? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ask? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was there any statement or discussion at the intervention that 
Faye had borrowed money to acquire drugs? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or that Nicole had? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or that anybody had incurred financial burdens to acquire drugs? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was there any discussion that Faye had gotten in trouble by 
meeting up with undesirable types in connection with her drug 
activity? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ask where Faye got the drugs? 
 
A: No, never asked her. 
 
Q: Was there any discussion about the source of the drugs? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now let's focus on the time period of March, April, May and June 
before Faye went into rehabilitation on June 9.  How many times had 
you yourself witnessed Faye using drugs? 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: How many times had you witnessed her drunk from alcohol 
consumption in those -- in that period of time? 
 
A: Specifically being drunk, drunk or high, or just specifically 
alcohol? 
 
Q: Intoxicated. 
 
A: In general, whether it's alcohol, drugs? 
 
Q: Well, I asked you how many times you had seen her take drugs.  
You said none. 
 
A: I didn't see her using it, but I've seen her high almost every day 
during that period of time.  There were only two or three days in 
between where she was not obviously high. 
 
Q: Now, did her daughter live with you then? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: When you said you saw her high every day, you didn't know 
whether it was from drugs or alcohol.  True? 
 
A: I assumed it was from the medication from the -- still from the 
surgery. 
 
Q: So you didn't think she was abusing drugs; you thought she was 
using drugs for pain or for other purposes related to her surgery.  
Right? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object as leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: No, I -- for an addict even a drop of alcohol is 
abusing it.  So if an addict like Faye takes half a glass of wine, she 
gets pretty drunk.  If that is done in addition to one pain pill, she's 
out there.  She slurs her speech.  She can't walk.  She falls over.  She 
-- you know, cigarettes burning all over the house. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: But you didn't think she was incapable of going on a vacation 
with you, for example. Correct? 
 
A: Well, actually, part of -- we had a discussion.  We were at a 
dinner, Nicole, O.J., Faye and I, about a week before going on the 
trip to Cabo -- actually 10 days before going to Cabo, and Faye was-- 
had taken some pills at home, and she went to the dinner and she 
ordered some wine, and I said to her, "Don t have the wine because 
you just took the medications," which was basically about two weeks 
or so after the surgery. 
 
Q: Well, the surgery was March 18th. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: 10 days before the Cabo trip is March 21.  So this sounds about a 
day or two after the surgery, not two weeks after.  True? 
 
A: Right, yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: But we had this -- we had this dinner, and we were talking about 
that Faye is going to be down in Cabo with us, and we don't want her 
to be high on drugs down in Mexico, so we asked her to really slow 
down on taking pills as much as she can and definitely not drinking.  
So -- 
 
Q: But you went with her. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you didn't tell her she couldn't go. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you didn't, when you got back, prevent her from driving.  
Right? 
 
A: Yes, actually on a few occasions I did. 
 
Q: But for the most part she was driving. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you knew so. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And she was picking up Francesca from school. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And doing her activities.  Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And nothing happened to Francesca.  Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And there were no car accidents, right, during this period of time? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And there was no physical injury that occurred to Faye as a result 
of drug use or alcohol use.  Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And she was going about her daily chores.  Right? 
 
A: If you consider staying at home doing her daily chore, because 
she couldn't move and didn't do much, then yeah. 
 
Q: Well, she took care of her daughter.  Right? 
 
A: Well, more or less.  I mean, they had a housekeeper.  The 
housekeeper took care -- 
 
Q: You didn't have the daughter taken away, for example.  Right? 
 
A: No, but I took her daughter -- I woke up her daughter in the 
morning; I dressed her; I got her to school; I made her lunch; I 
arranged for somebody to pick up Francesca from school and -- 
 
Q: Are you saying that Faye didn't do any of that for three months? 
 
A: Very little. 
 
Q: She didn't pick up her daughter once or -- 
 
A: No, she picked up her daughter periodically, but I think it was 
very trying for her to -- 
 
Q: But not trying enough to have her admitted. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Right? 
 
A: I talked to her many times about going back to meetings, seeing 
her counselor, getting back on track many times. 
 
Q: But you didn't have her put into a treatment center. 
 
A: No, because at that -- 
 
Q: And you cared for her.  Right? 
 
A: Well, at that time I had, like I said, made up my mind that this is 
not a healthy relationship for me, so I started really detaching.  This 
was at a time when O.J. and I were talking a lot about these are not -- 
he was not in a healthy relationship; I was not in a healthy 
relationship; Ron was not in a healthy relationship -- 
 
Q: You are not referring to the time period before Cabo now when 
you were talking with Mr. Simpson about his having an unhealthy 
relationship, are you? 
 
A: I think it actually started in this -- right around that time. 
 
Q: What does that mean, "right around that time"?  Before Cabo?  
After Cabo?  During Cabo? 
 
A: Both. 
 
Q: Both what? 
 
A: Before -- just briefly before Cabo. 
 
Q: So O.J. Simpson before the Cabo trip told you that he thought he 
was in an unhealthy relationship. 
 
A: Right. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And during the Cabo trip, when you and he were down there, you 
discussed the same thing? 
 
A: Well, there were great days and there were wonderful days, and 
there were days when something would happen and -- 
 
Q: Well, there were only four days.  We're only talking April 1 to 
April 4.  So when you say "there were great days" and there were 
bad days -- 
 
A: Right, exactly. 
 
Q: -- you have four days.  Right? 
 
A: Right.  On the trip.  On the trip, those immediate days.  I mean, 
the whole time period probably starting, yeah, just before the Cabo 
trip. 
 
Q: Okay.  Just before the Cabo trip -- 
 
A: Perhaps it would help, at this dinner -- 
 
Q: What dinner? 
 
A: The dinner where we --  
 
Q: On March 21st? 
 
A: Right, around that time. 
 
Q: Okay.  Proceed. 
 
A: There were a lot of -- there was a lot of activity happening in the 
sense of it was discussed that Nicole and O.J. wanted to go away 
somewhere for Easter, okay, and then Nicole said she wants to have 
Faye and me and Francesca with us. 
 
We decided to go to Mexico.  All of a sudden Kris Jenner and Bruce 
Jenner wanted to come along, too.  All of a sudden Nicole said, "I 
don't want them to go."  So O.J. was sitting there, having organized 
the house in Cabo, and Nicole now saying she doesn't want to go 
because the Jenners want to go, and it was getting confusing. 
 
And so O.J. realized, and again I realized, that this is getting very 
complicated and that the people were making things much more 
complicated than they needed to be.  So he started figuring out, my 
God, this is not the way that we would like to have -- that he 
would like to have a relationship, the way that I would like to have a 
relationship, and it deteriorated significantly after the Cabo trip. 
 
So in that time period. you know, it started out with he realizing that 
something's not right in the relationship, and it slowly degenerates. 
 
So what O.J. and I and Ron were doing, we were talking to each 
other about how to handle it, what to do, hang in there, just keep 
communication open and all that stuff. 
 
Q: Getting back to Faye's activities did you see her consume 
excessive alcohol during the months of March, April, May and June? 
 
A: Again, for her one drink is excessive. 
 
Q: Did you see her consume at any time more than one drink? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: On how many occasions? 
 
A: Particularly down in Cabo she was drinking quite a few 
margaritas. 
 
Q: After Cabo did you ever have occasion to see her drink more than 
one drink at a time? 
 
A: At my birthday party. 
 
Q: Which was when? 
 
A: April 30th. 
 
Q: Where was that? 
 
A: At my house. 
 
Q: And did she have a lot to drink that night? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: How many drinks? 
 
A: I don't know, but she was -- I didn't count how many drinks she 
had, but she was definitely high that night. 
 
Q: So any other occasions when you saw her drink more than one 
drink besides your birthday party after Cabo? 
 
A: I think that was it. 
 
Q: And you have no knowledge as to what quantity, if any, of 
prescription medication she was taking.  Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know where she got her medication? 
 
A: When I found the vials, I asked her who the doctors had been that 
gave her the medication because I didn't recognize the names, and 
they were different doctors where she had gotten her medications, 
prescription medications, in the past. 
 
Q: And what did she tell you? 
 
A: That's what she said. "I went to my dentist and" -- 
 
Q: And didn't give you any names? 
 
A: Yeah, she gave me names, but I forgot the names.  They were 
actually written on the label, you know, but I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did you see O.J. Simpson use cocaine, ever? 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: You ever see him take any drugs? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Never saw him use cocaine at the Harley-Davidson Cafe 
opening? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever used cocaine? 
 
A: Last time in 1981. 
 
Q: Not since 1981? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you used any illegal drugs since 1981? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And you're not -- Have you learned from any source that O.J. 
Simpson has used illegal drugs? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Have you ever asked him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Does he have bottles of pills at his house that are multicolored? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you heard that he does? 
 
A: I heard Faye write or saw written in Faye's book, but I think Faye 
wrote in her book that this was on the coffee table in his living room, 
and that's absolute nonsense. 
 
Q: Is it someplace else? 
 
A: No.  I never saw it. 
 
Q: You never saw it? 
 
A: No.  That's... 
 
Q: And you never saw Nicole take any drugs either. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you seen Cora Fischman at all since O.J. Simpson's release 
from prison? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: On how many occasions? 
 
A: Probably three, four times. 
 
Q: And where have you seen Cora Fischman? 
 
A: At Starbucks in Brentwood. 
 
Q: Anywhere else? 
 
A: I saw her once at O.J.'s house, and I've seen her -- actually, she's 
recently come into my office to be treated. 
 
Q: Who was present at O.J. Simpson's house when Cora Fischman 
was there and you were there? 
 
A: O.J., Cora and again Gigi, the housekeeper, me. 
 
Q: Did you talk about this situation at all, the lawsuit, the case? 
 
A: Actually, no.  I stopped in, said hello, and I had to go to the 
office, so she was there -- I was with her there for a couple minutes. 
 
Q: Why did you stop in? 
 
A: Just to say hello. 
 
Q: Have you traveled anywhere with Mr. Simpson other than Santa 
Barbara? 
 
A: Since his release? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you been to any -- So the only place you've been with him is 
Santa Barbara and Rockingham?  Nowhere else? 
 
A: At Nancy and Mark's home one evening here in L.A. 
 
Q: Anyplace else? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Burger King. 
 
THE WITNESS: The Burger King. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: The milk shake run.  Right? 
 
A: The milk shake run.  And Nancy has a shop at the Beverly 
Connection. 
 
Q: What's the name of the shop? 
 
A: I don't recall.  It's like a designer place.  And went to a restaurant 
next door. 
 
Q: Who was present at the -- did you say the Steinmans? 
 
A: I don't recall their last -- I don't know their last name. 
 
Q: Who was present there? 
 
A: Barbara, a man that builds cars, Suburbans, out of someplace in 
San Jose, Mark and Nancy, Rachel, and another couple that I didn't 
talk with very much, and their housekeeper. 
 
Q: Have you spoken to Paula Barbieri at all since O.J.'s release from 
jail? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: While he was in jail? 
 
A: Yeah 
 
Q: When? 
 
A: Pretty early on that one day I was at the jail, and I gave her a ride 
back.  That's it. 
 
Q: Did you talk to her about her knowledge of what had happened? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When did Mr. Simpson -- Well, let me back up.  Before the Cabo 
trip, you said that O.J. said things indicating that he was having an 
unhealthy relationship with Nicole.  When is the first time you can 
remember him making such a comment to you before the Cabo trip? 
 
A: Just about that time. 
 
Q: Now, you understood he was trying to reconcile with Nicole? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And he had been trying for the past year? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Correct? 
 
A: They had both been trying. yeah. 
 
Q: And during that entire year had he ever said anything to you 
about the progress of the relationship? 
 
A: There were a couple incidences where they proved to be difficult 
for both of them. I think.  One incidence was the incidence at a sushi 
bar, and the other incidence was at Christmas. 
 
Q: Christmas 1993? 
 
A: '93, yeah. 
 
Q: The California Sushi Bar was when? 
 
A: Was in the fall of '93. 
 
Q: You also went back to the opening of the Harley-Davidson Cafe.  
Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And was there an incident there, a quarrel between Nicole and 
O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: No. They were actually very happy.  I was only there for a day 
and a half. 
 
Q: And you saw no tension or conflict or fighting or arguments.  
Right? 
 
A: No.  On the contrary, the time that I was there, they seemed really 
happy. 
 
Q: Before I get to these two incidents -- I guess I haven't done this -- 
let me ask you a couple of background questions. 
 
Q: When did you first become friendly with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: Early summer '93. 
 
Q: When did you first meet him? 
 
A: Around that time.  I don't know the specific date. 
 
Q: When did you meet Faye Resnick? 
 
A: Fall of 1990. 
 
Q: When did you start to date her? 
 
A: Fall of 1990. 
 
Q: And when did you become engaged to her? 
 
A: Engaged? 
 
Q: To marry her. 
 
A: Actually not engaged to marry her, but engaged to give her a 
sense of security, was in December '93, Christmas '93. 
 
Q: Were you ever engaged to marry her? 
 
A: The way that it was -- that I brought it forward to her is she 
wanted to marry me, and I said, "There's no way that I will marry 
you unless you start addressing your problems," and then she says 
that she doesn't feel secure to be able to have the stamina to address 
her problems, so I said, 'Then let s do this:  As a token of me coming 
a step forward, I'll give you an engagement ring, but I will only 
consider getting into a marriage situation if for a period of a year, 
year and a half you've been in meetings, you've been holding a job 
and you've been getting your life together."  So that was the gist of 
the engagement. 
 
Q: You meant that when you said that? 
 
A: Oh, absolutely, yeah. 
 
Q: So from fall of 1990 to December of 1993 you were dating Faye? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: But not living with her? 
 
A: First dating.  Then she moved in --  she moved out of her 
husband's house -- 
 
Q: Mr. Resnick? 
 
A: Mr. Resnick's.  Then she got her own place, and she moved in I 
think in November '92.  I think it was. 
 
Q: Into your home. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And she lived there until after the -- after Exodus.  Right? 
 
A: No. There was a time when we were broken up. 
 
Q: When was that? 
 
A: That was -- no, actually I believe when she moved in was 
November '91. 
 
Q: '91. 
 
A: And then she was there until November '92 or October '92.  We 
broke up.  She had her own place, and she moved back in May '93. 
 
Q: And during the time that you knew her, from the fall of '90 until 
the first time she moved in in November of '91, was she in any 
treatment programs for drug or alcohol use? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And what about from thereafter? 
 
A: Yeah, I would -- 
 
Q: After November of '91. 
 
A: I took her to Betty Ford Clinic in I believe it was the spring of '92.  
Yeah, '92. 
 
Q: For what problem? 
 
A: For free-base cocaine. 
 
Q: And how long was she at Betty Ford? 
 
A: Three weeks. 
 
Q: Now, when she came out of Betty Ford, she lived at her own 
place for a while; then moved in with you in May of '93? 
 
A: Actually when she came out of Betty Ford, she was staying at my 
place again until later that year -- 
 
Q: Oh, I see.  Until October of '92. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Now, after Betty Ford, spring of '92, did she have any relapses? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: When? 
 
A: Which actually led to the breakup in the fall of -- 
 
Q: '92. 
 
A: So about --  
 
Q: Did she get any treatment? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How long did that relapse last? 
 
A: You know, there was a time when I just didn't see her because she 
had relapsed, and then she and I started talking again in January '93. 
 
Q: January '93.  And from January to May of '93 there was no 
relapse.  Correct? 
 
A: I believe that in the time she was actually trying to get a handle 
on her life. 
 
Q: And she moved in in May of '93? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And from May of '93 until her surgery no treatments? 
 
A: No treatments and no meetings -- 
 
Q: And no relapses? 
 
A: Well, there was periodic times where she would drink and have a 
couple of days of taking pills and going back out of that again and be 
able to last for three, four weeks and then have another three, four 
days of relapsing, but no concentrated treatment effort. 
 
Q: And the only time she had been admitted for drug use was Betty 
Ford in the spring of '92 during the time you knew her? 
 
A: Right.  Until -- 
 
Q: Exodus in June of '94. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: You said you were married before? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: For how long? 
 
A: For probably four years, four and a half years. 
 
Q: And do you have any children? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And have you been married any other occasions? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What years were you married? 
 
A: '86 through '90. But we separated in '88. 
 
Q: What is the name of your former wife? 
 
A: [Name Deleted] 
 
Q: And has [Name Deleted] ever met O.J. Simpson to your 
knowledge? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, did you first meet Nicole or O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: I first met Nicole. 
 
Q: When was that? 
 
A: Actually in January of '93. 
 
Q: And at that time Nicole was single woman.  Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And was not going out with O.J. Simpson.  Right? 
 
A That's correct 
 
Q: And you met her how? 
 
A: Actually Faye introduced me to her because Faye and Nicole 
were going to start seeing a counselor for group sessions to figure 
out some of their personal issues, and Faye and I just had started 
talking a little bit.  Faye was calling me to let me know that 
Francesca was missing me and so on and so forth. 
 
So Faye actually asked me to -- I think I met Nicole once or twice 
before at Faye's place, and then Faye asked me one day to come with 
them to one of these group sessions to get my opinion as to what I 
thought about this particular group and the guy that was heading it. 
 
Q: Is this Carl? 
 
A: It's somewhere off Sunset. 
 
Q: In that area? 
 
A: In that area, yeah. 
 
Q: You don't remember his name? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You went one time? 
 
A: Just one time. 
 
Q: And Faye was there and Nicole was there? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Any other of her friends there? 
 
A: I think there were -- there was a young man that Nicole had met. 
 
Q: Was that [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: Grant, yeah, that's right. 
 
Q: You went one session.  Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And what did you tell them about it? 
 
A: That I thought it was a very acceptable group, that the people 
there really seemed to be wanting to work on their personal issues. 
 
Q: How long did Faye and Nicole go to that group? 
 
A: I think Faye went one more time. 
 
Q: And Nicole?  Do you know? 
 
A: Nicole went four -- I don't know exactly how long the weeks 
were, but she actually opted to go for like an accelerated in-depth 
course of several weeks that she pulled through -- that she went 
through and -- 
 
Q: And you know this how? 
 
A: Because we would meet sometimes, Faye and Nicole and I, and 
Nicole would tell us about how great she felt about this class and so 
on and so forth and that she had -- at the end had come to the 
conclusion that she would like to try and work it out with O.J. again. 
 
Q: What issues was Nicole trying to work on by going to this group 
therapy? 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the lack of foundation. 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: To your knowledge, if you know from your conversations with 
her. 
A: I would say the things that were important to her were her 
insecurities, were her questioning her capacity of commitment, her 
guilt feelings concerning the kids -- 
Q: In what respect?A: Of having a broken-up family.  I think those 
would be like the primary things. 
 
Q: And she talked to you about these issues -- 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: -- in conversations that you had with her? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: So is it fair to say that after first meeting her and going to this 
group therapy session, you began to talk to her -- 
 
MR. LEONARD: Excuse me. I'm having trouble -- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: -- and having a friendship with her?  Is that fair to say? 
 
MR. LEONARD: I'm having trouble hearing, Mr. Petrocelli. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Is it fair to say that you developed a friendship with her during 
this period of time in early 1993? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And were talking -- you were talking with her about these various 
issues.  Right? 
 
A: Right.  I would ask her, you know, how things are going and then 
she would come and would give me feedback as to how the class is 
going for her. 
 
Q: And during this time you still had not met O.J. Simpson.  Right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Okay.  And in connection with talking about these issues, she told 
you that she was the former wife of O.J. Simpson and he was the 
father of her two children.  Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: She had split up from him? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And she was contemplating whether that was the right thing to 
do? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And whether she might go back to him? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did she tell you about the beatings that she suffered at his hands? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: She never mentioned that to you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she tell you about her abortions? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she tell you about the 1989 incident? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And did there come a time when she stopped going to this to your 
knowledge? 
 
A: Yeah, I think -- 
 
Q: This therapy. 
 
A: I think the course was done; the course was finished. 
 
Q: And what did she tell you at the end of the course about her 
plans? 
 
A: That she had started to talk to O.J. about reconsidering and trying 
to put their family back together. 
 
Q: And what did she tell you O.J. said? 
 
A: That at first he was very hesitant and that they talked I presume 
several times, but that they had made a decision to try to work it out. 
 
Q: And by the time Nicole told you that she and O.J. had made a 
decision to try to work it out, you still had not met Mr. Simpson.  
Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Or spoken to him.  Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did Nicole ever tell you why she had broken up with Mr. 
Simpson in the first place? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: What did she say? 
 
A: She said that what was very difficult for her to handle in their 
marriage were infidelity. 
 
Q: By O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did she describe to you the infidelities? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Who the persons were? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How many there were? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How pervasive it was? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Nothing like that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: She gave you no details one way or the other. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she tell you about any other problems besides infidelities? 
 
A: No, that was it. 
 
Q: Did you like Nicole? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Were you fond of her? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Did you continue to be fond of her throughout the remaining time 
that you knew her? 
 
A: Absolutely, yeah. 
 
Q: And did you find her to be a good person? 
 
A: I found her to be a good person that was going through a difficult 
time in her life, so sometimes she would react in a fashion that I 
wouldn't have reacted like that, but that was Nicole, so... 
 
Q: Did you find her to be an honest person? 
 
A: Yeah.  Yeah.  That's why I was so shocked, when she asked to 
come to the June 8th meeting about Faye's drug abuse, that she 
hadn't mentioned it to me before. 
 
Q: That she hadn't mentioned what to you before? 
 
A: Faye's drug use, because I had talked to Nicole about Faye. 
 
Q: When? 
 
A: About her drug use.  During the times since the surgery. 
 
Q: What did you ask her? 
 
A: "What's Faye doing? What's up with her? She's spending a lot of 
time with you. What's going on?" 
 
Q: And what did Nicole say? 
 
A: "Oh, nothing.  She's trying" -- Nicole was basically trying to let 
me know that all of Faye's problems were due to my inability to 
commit. 
 
Q: You're laughing as you say that. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Is that because you didn't believe that? 
 
A: Right.  I knew that that wasn't the case. 
 
Q: By the way, when O.J. Simpson told you about some of the 
doubts he was having about his relationship with Nicole, did you tell 
Nicole that?  Did you pick up the phone and say, "I just spoke to 
O.J., and he told me, you know, that he's having doubts about you"? 
 
A: No.  No. 
 
Q: And when -- 
 
A: Because by that time a little bit of a polarization had occurred 
between Cora, Faye and Nicole and Ron and O.J. and I, that there 
was this -- 
 
Q: Men against women.  Right? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
HE WITNESS: No, not men against women.  Just some guys trying 
to figure out what's going on in their life, yeah. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Say that again.  Guys trying to figure out what's going on in their 
lives? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And the guys were you, O.J. Simpson and Ron Fischman? 
 
A: Right.  I think it just occurred the same way that the girls were 
trying to figure out what to do with their life. 
 
Q: Now getting back to the story here, when did you first get 
together with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: I believe it was the early summer of '93. 
 
Q: And what was the occasion? 
 
A: I think he came to a dinner. 
 
Q: Whose dinner? 
 
A: To -- 
 
MR. LEONARD: Excuse me -- 
 
THE WITNESS: At a restaurant. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Excuse me.  I guess it's because of the air-
conditioning.  I'm really having a lot of trouble here. 
 
THE WITNESS: I think it was a dinner at Toscana restaurant. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Is that the first time that you ever met him? 
 
A: I believe so, yeah. 
 
Q: Is that the dinner that's described in Faye's book? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Is that the event at Toscana's where -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- Mr. Simpson threatened Alessandro/Marcello? 
 
MR. LEONARD: You mean allegedly? 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, allegedly, because it didn't happen at all, that 
incident, but that did not -- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I notice that you and Dan are agreeing on -- you almost said 
"allegedly" simultaneously.  Why is that? 
 
A: You said that Mr. Simpson threatened Alessandro. 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: He never did.  That evening in particular, I don't know on any 
other occasions, but that evening there was -- 
 
Q: I am not asking you to refute what Faye is saying, although I'm 
sure you'll get that out sooner or later, but what I am asking you is 
whether that's the same event. 
 
A: No, that's not. 
 
Q: Okay.  This was a different dinner at Toscana's with you and Faye 
Resnick -- 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: -- O.J. Simpson and Nicole.  Right? 
 
A: Yeah.  And some other people might have been there.  I know the 
first time I met him was in a restaurant setting. 
 
Q: Now, by this point in time had Nicole and O.J. begun their 
reconciliation process? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you're still continuing to talk to Nicole; in other words, she's 
more your friend at this point than O.J. is. 
 
A: Yes.  Yeah. 
 
Q: And how long did that continue to be the case, where you 
considered Nicole the closer friend? 
 
A: I would say until the Cabo trip. 
 
Q: Cabo of '94? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: April '94. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Now, let's start with that period of time in 1993 through Cabo '94.  
You first met Mr. Simpson at Toscana's in the summer.  From that 
point in time  on until Cabo in '94, how many times had you done 
things with him alone, if any? 
 
A: Not very much.  We went -- 
 
Q: Can you recall a single event that you and he did without the 
women? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And so fair to say then during that period of time the two of you 
were not close friends? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And you didn't do things together. 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And you didn't pick up the phone and call each other. 
 
A: Actually starting in probably December, we started more of a 
periodic checking in with each other. 
 
Q: December of 1993? 
 
A: '93, yeah.  But it wasn't a close friendship.  We started to develop 
a friendship. 
 
Q: Just started to. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And are you telling me that from starting in December, he would 
begin calling you just to see how you are? 
 
A: Right.  Or I would call him. 
 
Q: And how often would those phone calls occur? 
 
A: Infrequent.  Probably once every two weeks or so, because we 
also had started to talk about doing a business venture together. 
 
Q: When did that begin, that discussion? 
 
A: Probably about December '93. 
 
Q: Now, what business venture was that, by the way? 
 
A: O.J. had an offer to do a video for the Playboy Magazine, and that 
was a video geared towards the frequent traveler, and he had talked 
to me about in the past sometimes that traveling a lot or frequently is 
really -- it's difficult for the body, and I had given him some advice 
as to how to handle it. 
 
And so as Playboy started talking to him about it, he approached me 
to say, "Look, you've given me pieces of information in the past.  
Can we do something together here where we'll put together a 
package of information that we then do this Playboy video 
together?" 
 
And I said, "Yeah, sure." 
 
Q: Did he mention Playboy to you as early as December of '93 -- 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: -- or just the concept? 
 
A: The concept.  I don't really recall. 
 
Q: And what would your role in the Playboy video be, as outlined by 
him in these early discussions? 
 
A: Be the person who puts together the information for him. 
 
Q: And did you do so? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you get any money for that? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: How much? 
 
A: $5,000. 
 
Q: How did you agree on that sum? 
 
A: We didn't. 
 
Q: How did it come to be? 
 
A: I think it was a matter of I told O.J. sometimes that I worked 
about 60 hours on putting all that information together. 
 
Q: 6-0? 
 
A: 60, yeah.  6-0.  Over a period of like two months.  "And the thing 
is like when Playboy 
pays something, you'll get something." I wasn't concerned about 
getting payment for particular -- 
 
Q: You were willing to do it for free.  Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: When you put this time in to develop this information, it wasn't 
with the expectation, let alone agreement, that you would be paid. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And when did you get the money? 
 
A: I think in May '94 when -- 
 
Q: What's the date of the check? 
 
A: I don't know.  I don't know off the top of my head. 
 
Q: Who paid you the money? 
 
A: I think it came through O.J.'s office. 
 
Q: Not from Playboy? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Correct? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did you get a credit on the video? 
 
A: No.  I don't -- 
 
Q: Do you appear on the video? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Were you present at the making of the video? 
 
A: No. I was present at the negotiation -- one of the negotiations for 
the video. 
 
Q: For what reason? 
 
A: To pitch our -- play our pieces of information to the people from -- 
 
Q: You helped him pitch the project? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And who did you pitch it to? 
 
A: There were two people from Playboy Magazine there and I think 
the young man that actually, ended up being the instructor on the 
exercise part. 
 
Q: Now, what information did you on your own develop for this that 
you pitched to the Playboy people and to O.J.? 
 
A: There's a whole way on how to deal with jet lag and how to eat 
right, drink right, take the -- do the right kind of exercises, pick the 
right kind of times to fly and so forth, what vitamins to take to help 
you get yourself getting over jet lag, w hat foods to not eat. 
 
Q: What foods are you not supposed to eat? 
 
A: Meats. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Red meat. 
 
THE WITNESS: Heavy sauces. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Including McDonald's hamburgers. 
 
A: And milk shakes. 
 
Q: Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Can you give me the date of that?  Do you have a copy of the 
check? 
 
A: Copy of the? 
 
Q: The check. 
 
A: No, but I could -- 
 
Q: I would like to know when you got paid. 
 
A: Okay, we could probably find that out. 
 
Q: So you only had one meeting, then, in connection with this whole 
project.  Right? 
 
A: With Playboy. 
 
Q: With Playboy. 
 
A: But I had probably four or five meetings with 0.J. 
 
Q: What would happen at these meetings? 
 
A: We would sit down together and go over the information, how to 
put it in a logical sequence for presentation. 
 
Q: Okay.  And you were not present while the video was shot? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Not at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you see any of the outtakes? 
 
A: I never even saw the video. 
 
Q: Never? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know if it was ever released? 
 
A: I don't know.  I know that there was some footage shown during 
the trial, but I don't know -- 
 
Q: When Mr. Simpson gave you the money, did you ask him how 
the project came out?  Ask him for a copy of it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You accepted the money.  Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Is that the only time you ever received money from O.J. 
Simpson? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: $5,000? 
 
A: That's it.  Actually, I have that written down already to get you 
that copy of the bank statement. 
 
Q: Right.  Is that the only business venture you've ever entered into 
with O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: That's correct, yeah. 
 
Q: And you've had no other discussions or negotiations? 
 
A: We had a discussion in that whole time for that same project.  We 
talked about the vitamins, Juice Plus that he was taking, and we had 
actually pitched a little exercise piece of equipment to Playboy in 
conjunction with a whole jet lag thing. 
 
Q: Where was the Playboy meeting? 
 
A: At the Playboy building in Beverly Hills. 
 
Q: When did that occur? 
 
A: I have it written down in here under "O.J. meeting."  You have it 
in the copies there.  March 21st. 
 
Q: That was the meeting with Playboy? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: After March 21st did you do anything else with Mr. Simpson 
concerning this project? 
 
A: Well, we still talked about it sometimes as to I think one day I sat 
down with him for two hours before the shooting of the video and 
just have him recite the information to me, and I will talk to him -- 
 
Q: Critique him? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: At the end of the meeting did Playboy indicate that they were 
going to go forward with the project? 
 
A: No.  At that time they were just holding on this. 
 
Q: So that's it in terms of your history of business dealings with O.J. 
Simpson, including after he got out of jail? 
 
A: That's it. 
 
Q: Have you had any discussions with him about other business 
propositions or opportunities? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And have you ever lent any money to him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or borrowed money from him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How many times did you go out of town with O.J. Simpson prior 
to the Cabo '94 trip? 
 
A: Prior to the Cabo trip?  Well, I joined them in New York for the 
opening of the Harley-Davidson Cafe: went down to their house in 
Laguna one time. 
 
Q: The Simpson's house? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: With Faye Resnick? 
 
A: With Faye and my dad and Francesca. 
 
Q: And who is your dad? 
 
A: [Name Deleted] Reichardt. 
 
Q: Does he live in Los Angeles? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Where does he live? 
 
A: In Germany. 
 
Q: He was visiting? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And you took him to see O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Okay.  Tell me then about this Toscana event that Faye Resnick 
describes in her book. 
 
A: We were sitting there having dinner, and Alessandro walked in.  
Alessandro is actually -- I knew Alessandro before I knew O.J. and 
Nicole. 
 
Q: How? 
 
A: From riding motorcycles. 
 
Q: He is a motorcycle rider? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Does he ride in the same gang that you ride in? 
 
MR.RUBALCAVA: No. 
 
THE WITNESS: No gang. No, he just rides himself.  So Alessandro 
walked in, and he looked over to the table and he greeted us, and he 
went to proceed to move to another table.  And actually Nicole said 
something about Alessandro having been to one of her birthday 
parties and he did something that she didn't appreciate, and O.J. just 
looked over to the guy and said, "So that's the guy," You know, no 
big commotion as it was described by Faye. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Well, was there any discussion that Nicole had dated Alessandro? 
 
A:I think there was established earlier. 
 
Q: Earlier when? 
 
A: Earlier, a few weeks ago. 
 
Q: So you understood that Mr. Simpson knew that Nicole had 
already dated -- 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: -- Alessandro.  Correct? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did you know she had dated Alessandro? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you know it as of the time of this dinner. 
 
A: No.  Until basically that dinner, I really had no knowledge that 
she had dated him. 
 
Q: And what happened in the dinner to inform you that Nicole had 
dated Alessandro? 
 
A: That Nicole was saying that Alessandro came to her party and he 
got pretty drunk there and that he went into the garage and I guess 
pulled his pants down and took a picture of himself, and Nicole said 
something to the effect as, you know "He didn't have to do that, 
knowing that I had been with him," you know, something to that 
effect. 
 
Q: What did he do with the photograph?  Did she say? 
 
A: He showed it around at the party. 
 
Q: And Nicole described that at the dinner table? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Okay.  And when she described that, what did O.J. Simpson say? 
 
A: O.J. Simpson said, "So that's the guy." 
 
Q: Kidding? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Serious?  Upset?  What was the tenor of the comment? 
 
A: Almost like I really don't want to hear about it, you know. 
 
Q: In other words, cut it out. 
 
A: Yeah.  Quit it. 
 
Q: Quit it. 
 
A: Yeah. Quit it. 
 
Q: Quit it. 
 
A: Yeah.  Basically he looked at A1essandro and said. "Oh, that's the 
guy.  Oh, let's not talk about it." 
 
Q: And did Nicole respect his wish that she should not talk about it 
anymore? 
 
A: Actually, I think from there it ensued to Nicole saying that he 
doesn't have a right to be so controlling as to control the 
conversation, and from there it got into more of a disagreement as to 
what controlling is and not, but within a couple of minutes it was 
resolved, and things went on.  We stayed there; we finished our 
dinners; everybody went their merry way. 
 
Q: Nicole was complaining about O.J. Simpson being too 
controlling? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: What did O.J. Simpson say in response to Nicole's comments? 
 
A: I think the gist of the conversation was such as, "What's 
controlling about that?  I don't want to hear about the guy." 
 
Q: Did you weigh in in this debate? 
 
A: Oh, absolutely. 
 
Q: What did you say? 
 
A:I agreed with him, because the circumstances where somebody 
walks in from their past, from the girl's past, it was always okay for 
them to talk about it, but if either -- let's say if I mentioned the name 
of a former lover, Faye would go nuts.  If O.J. mentioned Paula or a 
picture was seen of Paula, Nicole went crazy. 
 
You know, so it was a matter of saying, "Well, what is it?  It's okay 
for you guys to talk about it and not for us?"  And then we are called 
being controlling, something like that. 
 
Q: Well, Nicole wasn't calling you controlling.  She was calling O.J. 
controlling. 
 
A: That night. 
 
 
Q: That night.  When did that occur? 
 
A:I think that was in the fall of '93. 
 
Q: Now, you also mentioned something about a dinner at the 
California Sushi Bar? 
 
A: Uh-huh.  Yes. 
 
Q: And that was also discussed in Faye's book.  Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: When did that occur, the sushi bar? 
 
A: I think that was in the early fall of '93 also. 
 
Q: Relate that incident. 
 
A: That incident was that I picked up Faye after the office to go 
down and join O.J. and Nicole.  They were doing a taping, an 
interview.  And so Faye and I drove down to Hermosa Beach, 
something like that, and when O.J. was finished we got in our 
respective cars and drove down to the sushi restaurant and were 
sitting at the sushi bar. 
 
And I think it was a nice evening.  It was a great evening.  Just 
talking.  And Nicole and Faye started talking about wanting to go out 
dancing after having dinner and -- 
 
Q: Were you sitting at a sushi bar -- 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: -- or at a table? 
 
A: Sitting at a bar. 
 
Q: Where were you positioned at the bar? 
 
A: There was -- 
 
Q: Near the end, in the middle or where? 
 
A: I was at the end. 
 
Q: At the very end of the bar? 
 
A: At the very end of the bar.  There's a stairway that goes down.  
We were sitting at the very end of the bar and the bar continues to go 
around like that (Indicating).  At the very corner there was O.J. 
sitting; next to him, Nicole; next to Nicole, Faye -- 
 
Q: I thought you said you were at the corner. 
 
A: No, we were -- the whole group, we were at the corner. 
 
Q: Okay.  So describe the order again. 
 
A: O.J.'s sitting in the very corner, Nicole sitting next to him, Faye 
sitting next to her and then me.  And so we were talking, the four of 
us talking like that, and Faye and Nicole were talking about going 
dancing, and all of a sudden Nicole started talking about going to the 
place that Joseph always took them.  And we all knew that Joseph 
was a former lover of Nicole's -- 
 
Q: How did you know? 
 
A: Because Joseph also had been a former lover of Faye's, and so it 
was pretty much common knowledge, and basically -- 
 
Q: I still don't understand how you knew. 
 
(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the 
hearing of the reporter.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I still don't understand how you knew that Joseph used to go out 
with Nicole. 
 
A: Because Faye and Nicole had talked about him. 
 
Q: To you? 
 
A: Or in my presence. 
 
Q: Okay.  Go back to this incident. 
 
A: So I know that a couple days earlier O.J. and Nicole had had a 
disagreement about Paula again, and so O.J. said, you know, 
basically, "Why do you have to bring up his name?" 
 
Q: Whose name? 
 
A: Joseph's name.  When I know in his head he was thinking a few 
days earlier she was getting on O.J.'s case about taking pictures 
down and so on and so forth, with the argument that Nicole doesn't 
want to hear anything about or see anything about O.J.'s former 
lovers while they were separated, but here was Nicole going -- 
bringing out her former lover.  And OJ. just said, "Why do you have 
to bring up that name?"  And Nicole started going ahead again, a 
similar type of situation. "Don't be so controlling and I can do what I 
want." 
 
So O.J. got up and went down to the restroom, and then a couple 
minutes later Faye went down into the restroom.  O.J. came back up 
and he basically said, you know, "Let's go. Let's blow out of here. 
This is ridiculous." 
 
And he proceeded to order the check and started moving towards the 
door.  He said goodbye to the owner that came over, and Faye came 
back up and basically we walked out of the place. 
 
Q: Then what happened? 
 
A: Then on the street O.J. was going towards his car, and Nicole 
threw something after him verbally in the sense of, you know, "Here 
you go again.  You run off like that," something in that fashion, you 
know.  O.J. just turned around and said, "Look, you know, I don't 
need to hear all this stuff.  Let's just go home." 
 
And Nicole almost was kind of like -- almost like they were both 
provoking verbally each other, and it ended up that we took Nicole 
home and O.J. drove home by himself. 
 
Q: How did it end up that way?  Why did it end up that way? 
 
A: Because I don't think that either one of them wanted to sit in the 
car with each other and talk more about the same issue. 
 
Q: Now, did O.J. -- so O.J. was upset.  Correct? 
 
A: Well, they both were upset. 
 
Q: Well, I am not talking about both.  I am only talking about O.J. 
Simpson.  He was upset that evening.  Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: As a result of this incident. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Correct? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And he elevated his voice during the argument.  Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And stormed out of there. Right? 
 
A: I wouldn't say he "stormed out of there," but we all walked 
together out of there. 
 
Q: Well, he terminated the evening early.  True? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Because he was upset.  Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: At the mention of Joseph's name.  Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: By the way, did you bill Mr. Simpson for the chiropractic 
treatments? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You did it for free? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Who else have you treated for free? 
 
A: The list is endless. 
 
Q: Is it? 
 
A: Yeah.  I treat friends for free.  If Dominick gets hurt in a 
motorcycle accident -- you know, I don't charge friends. 
 
Q: Have you ever treated Dan for free? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Meaning he has had to pay? 
 
A: I treated the court reporter for free. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, you had said in this story that you just related that in 
your -- in O.J.'s mind, you knew he was thinking about 
disagreements that Nicole had had over Paula, and that's why he was 
upset.  In other words, you were justifying O.J.'s thinking process.  
How did you know all about Paula and disagreements between O.J. 
Simpson and Nicole about her? 
 
A: Because we had talked, Nicole and I -- Nicole actually talked to 
Faye about it at the house one evening. 
 
Q: Before this -- 
 
A: Before it, right. 
 
Q: -- California Sushi Bar dinner? 
 
A: Right. 
 
I Q: And what had you been told about that? 
 
A: That, well, Nicole was still kind of trying to go through the 
thought process of what she had learned in that group thing, and she 
was trying to figure out what of that argument that they had was her 
involvement and what wasn't.  So that's how I know about that. 
 
Q: You didn't know about it from Mr. Simpson.  Right? 
 
A: Yeah.  No, I didn't know from Mr. Simpson. 
 
Q: When you recounted the sushi bar incident, you said that Nicole 
and O.J. had disagreements about Paula again.  You used the word 
"again," as though to suggest that she was a frequent topic of 
disagreement between the two. 
 
A: Periodically, yeah. 
 
Q: And your knowledge or that was gained exclusively from Faye 
and Nicole.  Right? 
 
A: On the Christmas evening I gained that knowledge from O.J. 
 
Q: This is before Christmas, though 
 
A: No. No. 
 
Q: So as of the California sushi dinner, you had never spoken to O.J. 
Simpson about Paula.  Right? 
 
A: Right, correct. 
 
Q: And the information that you had gained from Faye and Nicole 
concerning Paula was what? 
 
A: That O.J. had been dating her. 
 
Q: And what else? 
 
A: That's it. 
 
Q: And you said something about photographs. 
 
A: Yeah, that there were photos in O.J.'s house of Paula. 
 
Q: And Nicole had asked O.J. Simpson to take them down? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did you know about the incident at Gretna Green in October of 
1993 when Nicole Simpson had to call the police? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Mr. Simpson didn't tell you about that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Nicole tell you -- 
 
A: You mean at that time? 
 
Q: At that time. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he call you up the next day and say, "You won't believe what 
happened"? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Nicole tell you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Faye tell you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: To your knowledge did Nicole tell Faye? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: When did you first find out about it? 
 
A: I think after the trial had started. 
 
Q: When you heard that tape of Nicole's voice, were you surprised? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
A: Because Nicole raised her voice often like that. 
 
Q: Did you detect fear in her voice when you heard the tape? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Terror? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
Q: Did you hear O.J. Simpson's voice on that tape? 
 
A: No. I didn't even listen to the whole tape. You know, it's like 
when the things in the trial came up, very often I just switched off. 
 
Q: So -- 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Excuse me one second. 
 
(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the 
hearing of the reporter.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Your lawyer wants you to clarify something. 
 
A: Right.  From the moment on that I had the subpoena, I was asked 
to not watch the trial, so part of when you hear me say "I don't listen 
to it" is because when something comes on, I would switch off the 
television.  You know, it's like... 
 
Q: After you testified, did you listen to the tape? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever heard the tape? 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Excuse me just one second. 
 
(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the 
hearing of the reporter.) 
 
THE WITNESS: I heard only little pieces of the tape, and Dominick 
also informed me that there might be a retrial coming at some point, 
so to keep myself away from newspapers and -- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: In any event, you've never heard the tape.  Is that what you're 
saying? 
 
A: Not the full tape.  Just like -- 
 
Q: You've never heard OJ. Simpson on that tape? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Screaming and ranting and raving? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection to the characterization. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: No? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Cursing and using vulgarity -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- and profanity? 
 
A: I heard just a little bit of Nicole one time on the tape, and to me... 
 
Q: Prior to Mr. Simpson's arrest, did you ever hear him scream and 
yell -- 
 
A: No 
 
Q: -- at Nicole or about Nicole? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Did you ever see him push her or -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- touch her in an aggressive way? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: He was always the perfect gentleman.  Is that fair to say? 
 
A: Yeah, in my presence, definitely. 
 
Q: Did you ever find out from him that he beat her up on New Year's 
Eve? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: He didn't tell you that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Not even when you became close friends? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the argumentative question. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you saw -- You saw those pictures of Nicole beaten and 
bruised? 
 
A: Glimpse of it. 
 
Q: Did you ever ask Mr. Simpson why he had done that to her? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Not interested in knowing? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: It doesn't concern you -- 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the argumentative question. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Fair to say? 
 
A: Fair to say it doesn't -- it's not my point in life to find that out, no. 
 
Q: You are not interested in finding out who killed Nicole.  True? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object. Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: I would like to find out who killed Nicole. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I mean, you'd like to as a matter of idle curiosity, but you're not 
interested to the point where you're going to do something about it.  
True? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: That's correct. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And you value your friendship with O.J. Simpson.  Right? 
 
A: I value friendships. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Argumentative. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Well, I am not asking you about other friendships.  I am only 
asking about O.J. Simpson.  He is the focus of my question.  You 
value your friendship with him.  Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Have you ever seen Mr. Simpson exercise? 
 
A: If you can call it exercise. yeah. 
 
Q: Prior to Nicole's death? 
 
A: Yeah. Just -- not really exercise, but do some stretching and do a 
couple little weights.  That's all. 
 
Q: You mean early in the morning? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: What was he wearing? 
 
A: When he -- 
 
Q: Was doing the exercising that you witnessed. 
 
A: Sweat pants. 
 
Q: Have you ever gone jogging with him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or running? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or anything like that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What color were the sweat pants? 
 
A: I think they were gray. 
 
Q: You only saw one color? 
 
A: Yeah, for the exercise. yeah.  It was one morning in his garage; he 
was doing some stuff. 
 
Q: Oh, in the garage? 
 
A: Uh-huh.  For weights.  For stretching sometimes, like I said in the 
past, we did that in his bedroom. 
 
Q: The weights are in his garage.  Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What was he wearing when he was doing the stretching in his 
bedroom? 
 
A: The same gray sweat pants. 
 
Q: The exact same pair of pants, or they were also gray? 
 
A: Also gray.  I don't know if they were the same exact. 
 
Q: Did he have any dark sweat pants? 
 
A: Not that I know of. 
 
Q: He didn't? 
 
A: I don't know whether he has dark sweat pants or not. 
 
Q: You have no idea. Right? 
 
A: I have no idea. 
 
Q: By the way, are you wearing Bruno Magli shoes today? 
 
A: No.  I'm not.  Hush Puppies. 
 
Q: Do you own a pair of Bruno Magli shoes? 
 
A: No, I don't. 
 
Q: You told me about another incident in Christmas of 1993. 
 
A: Uh-huh 
 
Q: You want to relate that to me? 
 
A: Christmas '93 was at Kris Jenner's house.  It was a Christmas 
party at Kris Jenner's house, and Faye, Francesca, my dad and I were 
driving up to the house of the Jenners, stopped right in front of the 
garage to get some presents out of the trunk, and O.J. came walking 
out the door and saying, "I don't need this crap," and he walked 
towards his car. 
 
And we were standing there, going like, "What the hell is happening 
now, " and Nicole came running after him, screaming and yelling at 
him, and Faye went to talk to Nicole and I went to talk to O.J., and I 
said, "What's up?" I leaned over in his car and said. "What's going 
on?" 
 
And he related to me at that moment that I think it was Joseph was at 
the Christmas party and that they had a disagreement about Paula -- 
O.J. and Nicole had a -- he relayed to me that he doesn't need that, to 
have to deal with Nicole's crap, and he was gonna go home. 
 
Nicole came then across the street with Faye in tow, and they started 
arguing, and then Faye took Nicole away -- 
 
Q: Who started arguing? 
 
A: O.J. and Nicole. 
 
Q: What were they saying? 
 
A: That O.J. was saying, "Look, I don't need this stuff.  I don't need 
this crap in my life."  And Nicole was going -- saying, "This is no 
crap. You have Paula and," nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, and just going 
back and forth like that.  And it ended up that Nicole went upstairs, 
got the kids, and they went in O.J.'s car and they drove off. 
 
Q: When you spoke privately to O.J., what was he saying to you?  
What did he say to you? 
 
A: He was talking to me about that he doesn't need to deal with 
having to be confronted with Cora's ex-lovers -- 
 
Q: Cora? 
 
A: Sorry. -- Nicole's ex-lovers if at the same token she accuses him or 
wants him to never mention and have nothing of his ex-lovers in his 
life. 
 
Q: And did he explain to you how he had been confronted with an 
ex-lover of Nicole? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: What did he say? 
 
A: He said that -- I don't know right now whether it was Joseph or 
someone else that was at that Christmas party at the Jenners' house, 
and that was probably the extent of the conversation that moment 
before they drove off. 
 
Q: Did he say that Nicole had done anything at the Christmas party 
in reference to Joseph? 
 
A: I don't think that at that moment when I talked to him in the car 
we talked about it, but a couple days later him and I talked about it, 
that Nicole had come over to his house and again raised questions 
about Paula, because Paula had sent a Christmas basket to O.J. and it 
happened to be delivered when Nicole was at his house. 
 
So Nicole started to get on O.J.'s case about still being with Paula, 
and O.J. said, "I'm not with Paula," but she's grateful for what he had 
done in the past for her, so she sends him a Christmas basket, so no 
big deal.  So Nicole went off on him about this Christmas basket, 
then only to get in the car going over to the Jenners' house and to be 
confronted with one of Nicole's ex-lovers. 
 
Q: Did O.J. say he was confronted with Nicole's ex-lover? 
 
A: Well, just walking in a situation and having him be there. 
 
Q: Did he think Nicole had set him up for this? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did he tell that you Nicole planned this, that we would go to the 
party and that Joseph would be there? 
 
A: No.  Perhaps I should use a different word.  When I say being 
"confronted" with Joseph.  I think it was -- 
 
Q: What you mean to say was in the same room? 
 
A: In the same room, right. 
 
Q: But he didn't say that Nicole was responsible for putting him in 
the same room as an ex-lover. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Right? 
 
A: No, he wasn't saying that.  He was saying -- 
 
Q: But the mere sight of Joseph there is what upset him? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: No.  What upset him was the fact that Nicole was 
on O.J.'s case for having received a Christmas basket and then O.J. 
dealing with Joseph at the Jenners' house. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: When you say "dealing with Joseph," the only thing that 
happened to him that he told you about is that he saw Joseph. 
 
A: Right. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: And the only thing that happened at the house was 
that Paula sent the basket, and then Nicole -- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I am not asking you to defend O.J. Simpson.  You know, I just 
want you to answer my questions.  Okay? 
 
A: And I want to clarify the way that you're asking the questions. 
 
Q: I know, but you don't need to do that because there's really good 
lawyers who will bring out the other side to this, if there is another 
side. Okay? 
 
I just want to make this clear: The only thing that O.J. Simpson told 
you in reference to Joseph at the Jenners' party was that he saw 
Joseph.  Correct? 
 
A: Right.  Actually he went to Joseph, said hello to Joseph; then 
walked over to Nicole and said, "See, ex-lovers in our lives are going 
to be around." 
 
Nicole in that moment turned around to him, called him a liar and 
said that "You're still seeing Paula, and I know it." 
 
That's what got O.J. upset, not the view of Joseph.  What got him 
upset is the -- that it would be okay for Nicole to get on his case 
about an ex-lover and -- 
 
Q: Now, did O.J. Simpson specifically tell you, "Now, Christian, I 
want you to understand this because you might have to repeat it a 
couple of years from now: It wasn't seeing Joseph that upset me" -- 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: -- "it was the fact that Nicole started yelling at me in front of 
everybody.  That's what upset me"? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the argumentative nature of the question. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Is that what you're saying that O.J. Simpson said to you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: What I'm saying is that he was upset about the fact that Nicole 
yelled at him about something that would be okay for her.  It was 
okay for her but not for him, and for a couple trying to get back 
together, that doesn't quite work -- 
 
Q: In terms of the conflict at the Jenner residence, based on what 
O.J. Simpson said to you, it began with O.J. Simpson seeing Joseph.  
True? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the word conflict. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: No? 
 
A: No.  It began with -- the conflict began in the moment when O.J. 
went to Nicole and Nicole yelling at him.  That's what started the 
conflict, not Joseph -- 
 
Q: But O.J. Simpson said he went to Nicole and said, "See, you can 
be together in the same room with ex-lovers."  Right? 
 
A: But that wasn't the -- 
 
Q: And O.J. told you he had no problem with seeing Joseph there. 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And he told you that he was happy to be there and stay there.  
Right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And O.J. told you that in fact he struck up a conversation with 
Joseph.  Right? 
 
A: He went over and said, "Hello, Joseph." 
 
Q: And they got along handsomely.  Right? 
 
A: I don t know whether they talked very much.  I wasn't there. 
 
Q: I am only asking you what O.J. Simpson told you. 
 
A: Right, that's correct. 
 
Q: Okay.  And they got along, and then he goes over to Nicole and 
Nicole blows up at him, and that's why he got upset.  Right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: In other words, once again O.J.'s telling you it's Nicole's fault.  
True? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't think that he's saying it is Nicole's fault.  I 
think it is a matter of two people getting into arguments over former 
lovers. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: We'll stop there. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Okay, propitious timing. 
 
We are off the record? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: We are off the record, Mr. Rubalcava. 
 
(ENDING TIME: 4:30 P.M.) 
 
I DECLARE UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY THAT THE 
FOREGOING IS TRUE AND CORRECT. 
 
SUBSCRIBED AT , CALIFORNIA. THIS _ DAY OF _, 19_.

EXAMINATION (Resumed) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Mr. Reichardt, have you spoken to anybody since the 
adjournment of the deposition on Friday concerning this case, this 
lawsuit, or your deposition? 
 
A: No, I have not. 
 
Q: Have you had any contact with O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: No, I haven't. 
 
Q: Have you talked to him on the phone? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you been to his house? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you purposefully stay away? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you spoken to his lawyers -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- including Dan Leonard? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or anyone else? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: No? 
 
A: No, I haven't. 
 
Q: Did you read anything, review anything, look at anything -- 
 
A: No 
 
Q: -- having to do with this case? 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Except those documents. 
 
THE WITNESS: I just separated out those documents, but I 
haven't reviewed anything. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Now, you came here with some materials in response to my 
subpoena, and for the record I will identify them and then mark 
them later on when we get  copies made. 
 
It appears that you produced your Pocket Day-Timer for July 1994 
through December 1994, one for January through June of 1995, 
and one for July through December of 1995; is that correct? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you already gave us the January to June 1994 last week? 
 
A: That's right. 
 
Q: Now, the other three that you gave to us today July of 1994 
through December of 1995, do you know whether they contain any 
entries having any connection whatsoever to O.J. Simpson or this 
lawsuit? 
 
A: I doubt it. 
 
Q: Briefly describe your custom and practice with respect to these 
Day-Timers, what they are for, what their purpose is for, how you 
use them, and so forth. 
 
A: Basically they help me keep my days a little bit more organized.  
I write down people that I need to call, people I have appointments 
with, vacations.  That's about it. 
 
Q: Does anyone else have access to these other than yourself? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Your secretary or assistant or anyone like that? 
 
A: No.  It stays pretty much always with me. 
 
Q: You are the only person who would make entries in these 
books? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do they contain your business appointments? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q But not your patients? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: That is bookkeeping done in the office? 
 
A: That is done at the office, right. 
 
Q You also mentioned something else? 
 
A: This is the beginning of '96 Day-Timer -- 
 
Q: That you have in front of you? 
 
A: -- which is my current right now. 
 
Q: And the bank statement showing the $5,000 transaction with 
O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: Those are still with my accountant.  I submitted everything to 
him for tax returns and all of  that stuff stays with him. 
 
MR.RUBALCAVA: Can your accountant forward a copy of that 
particular statement directly to Mr. Petrocelli?  You will see that 
that happens? 
 
THE WITNESS: I will organize in getting that done for you. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: What is his name? 
 
A: [Deleted name] 
 
Q: [Deleted name]? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q Where is his office? 
 
A: He has an office in Pasadena and another one in Tazana. 
 
Q: What is his telephone number? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Now, you are looking at a book with some phone numbers that 
is at the end of your planner for 1996 -- 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: -- is that a book with telephone numbers that was had and used 
in 1994? 
 
A: Yes.  No.  Actually, I rewrote it at the beginning of this year to 
clean it up. 
 
Q: Where is the one that you had for 1994? 
 
A: I threw it away. 
 
Q: How many entries in the telephone book there pertain to O.J. 
Simpson, family, friends, et cetera? A number of them? 
 
A: Yes.  Probably 10, 15, something like that. 
 
Q: May I see that? 
 
A: Sure. 
 
Q: Cora appears in here.  Is that Cora Fischman? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Gigi appears in here, is that Mr. Simpson's housekeeper Gigi?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: It is another Gigi; right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Keith appears in here.  I take it that that is not Keith 
Zlomsowitzh; true? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Rolf appears in here.  Is that Rolf Bauer? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: With regards to reproduction, I would prefer 
that you look through the documents that Dr. Reichardt has given 
to you and reproduce only those that pertain to this case.  This is 
his specific request.  There are documents there that really have 
nothing to do with this case or Mr. Simpson. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I will have to do that at the lunch break. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: That's fine.  I appreciate that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: At a minimum, what I will do is make copies 
of the documents that the witness acknowledges pertain to this 
matter. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: That's a good idea. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I would like an equal opportunity. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: This is your witness.  You met with him.  
You have talked to him. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I haven't seen these documents. 
 
MR.PETROCELLI: That remains to be seen. 
 
(Mr. Fredric Goldman enters the deposition proceedings.) 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Can I have copies made of  these for 
everyone.  And I would like copies made of  these documents.  
Wait a second. 
 
Q: Mr. Reichardt, we are going to have copies made of the Day-
Timers that you gave us that I just described a few moments ago. 
 
And now I am looking at this yellow folder that has materials in it 
including some typewritten materials and copies of articles and 
some hand-written notes, and these materials were assembled and 
collected by you in hopes of writing a book as part of that effort; is 
that true? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And this is the book that you mentioned in your testimony on 
Friday the idea for which was spawned by the O.J. Simpson case; 
correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And part of this book relates to your experiences and your 
knowledge of the O.J. Simpson case; correct? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: And part of it relates to your thoughts, musings, and 
philosophies about life in general; is that true? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Now, this first -- Let me back up.  I asked you on Friday not to 
show these materials to Mr. Simpson and his lawyers, and did you 
keep that promise? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So they haven't seen these to your knowledge? 
 
A: No, they haven't. 
 
Q: And you have not discussed it with them? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, these typewritten materials, I am holding in my hand the 
group of papers that you told me relate to the O.J. Simpson case.  
The remainder of the materials are in the yellow file that you think 
are just general thoughts and ideas that have no specific application 
to this case; correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: For now, let's focus on the O.J. Simpson papers.  They are 10 
pages or so of white typewritten notes; correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Who typed those? 
 
A: My secretary. 
 
Q: What is her name? 
 
A: [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: Is she still your secretary? 
 
A: Yes, she is. 
 
Q: There are seven pages of pink hand-printed notes.  Are these 
your notes? 
 
A: Yes, they are. 
 
Q: All in your handwriting? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And then we have a page with handwriting on both sides.  Are 
these in your handwriting also? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What I am going to do now is have these copied, and then later 
on during a break I will review them and we will come back to 
them.  Okay? 
 
A: Great. 
 
Q: Can you identify any time other than 9 o'clock on the evening 
of June 12 when O.J. Simpson called you up on the telephone to 
tell you where he  would be later that same evening? 
 
A: Other than calling during the day and saying, "We will see you 
later tonight at dinner" some other times, no, nothing -- no specific 
incident. 
 
Q: So the only time that you can recall O.J. Simpson ever calling 
you up to tell you where he would be later that evening was on the 
evening of June 12, 1994 when he called you at approximately 
9:00 p.m.; true? 
 
MR. LEONARD: I am going to object -- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me. 
 
Q: True? 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: I am going to consult. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, you cannot consult in the middle of an 
answer. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: I think you can. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No, you can't.  He can answer the question.  
If you have an objection, you can make it, but there is no reason to 
talk to him about my question.  I don't understand that. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Do you want to talk to me? 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Can I get my objection in. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, I would like to get an  answer first to 
my question. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I have an objection. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I want an answer without your talking to your 
lawyer, and then you can talk to your lawyer, and if you want to 
clarify, then you can clarify.  I am entitled to that.  You can make 
your objection first.  Go ahead. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I am going to object.  It misstates his prior 
testimony. 
 
MR.PETROCELLI: That's fine. Are you finished? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.  Please repeat the question and repeat 
it in the transcript as well. 
 
I want a simple question and answer.  And then you may answer 
and then you can consult, and then if you want to change your 
testimony or amplify it, that is your choice. 
 
(The record was read as follows: 
 
"Q: So the only time that  you can recall O.J. Simpson ever calling 
you up to tell you where he would be later that evening  was on the 
evening of June 12, 1994 when he called you at approximately 
9:00 p.m.; true?") 
 
THE WITNESS: That I can specifically recall, yes. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Okay. 
 
(Discussion was held between the witness and his counsel out of  
the hearing of the reporter.) 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Which is consistent with what you have 
testified to before. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Now, let me ask you this question. 
 
A: Can I clarify my answer from before? 
 
Q: When Mr. Leonard examines you, I think he will give you an 
ample opportunity to try to deal with that answer. 
 
You testified before that you knew the time was 9 o'clock, you 
were pretty sure of that, too, one minute off perhaps? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you said that the clock was one of  those analog clocks 
with a face on it; right? 
 
A: (Witness nods head.) 
 
Q: Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Where was this clock located? 
 
A: On a piece of artwork at the end of the living room. 
 
Q: Do you still have it? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Is it a free-standing clock? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was it situated in view, eye's view of the television? 
 
A: No. It was situated off to the left. 
 
Q: Is that where the telephone was located? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you have to get up to answer the telephone? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Is it a portable phone that you were using? 
 
A: No.  It was a phone that was standing right by the couch. 
 
Q: Were you lying on the couch or sitting? 
 
A: Sitting. 
 
Q: So you were sitting on the couch alone watching television and 
the phone rang and you reached over where, to your right? 
 
A: To the left. 
 
Q: To your left.  And you picked up the phone? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Then as you picked up the phone did you look to your left or to 
your right? 
 
A: To the left. 
 
Q: To the left. 
 
A: To the clock. 
 
Q: And how far was that clock from you? 
 
A: Ten feet. 
 
Q: Was the light on -- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- in the room? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was it in the same room as the television? 
 
A: The clock? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And is it a big clock? 
  
A: (Indicating ) 
 
Q: Could you estimate for the record the diameter of that? 
 
A: Ten inches across, eight inches across. 
 
Q: You were showing a much smaller diameter in my view with 
your fingers just now, like more like five inches.  Do you think it is 
about -- 
 
A: Eight to ten inches. 
 
Q: Okay.  Is it your habit, by the way, when you pick up the phone 
to look at that particular clock? 
 
A: Yes, pretty much. 
 
Q: Why? 
 
A: Because the phone is right there.  I look at it -- Throughout the 
day I look at clocks and whatever time it is. 
 
Q: Did you have a watch on? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: What were you wearing, by the way, when you were sitting on 
the couch watching television? 
 
A: Probably some sweats, a sweat suit. 
 
Q: Not probably.  What exactly were you wearing? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Can you tell me, as clearly as you knew it was around 9 o'clock, 
can you tell me what you were wearing? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Did you have shoes on? 
 
A: Doubtful.  I hardly ever wear shoes at home. 
 
Q: But you do not know for sure? 
 
A: I don't know for sure. 
 
Q: Now, there was an incident when you were with Faye Resnick 
in your -- Is it an apartment? 
 
A: Condominium. 
 
Q: Condominium.  On [Address Deleted]? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: -- when Faye informed you that O.J. Simpson had just told her 
that he was going to kill Nicole; correct? 
 
A: (Witness shakes head.) 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Leading. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: To the best of your knowledge when did that occur? 
 
A: The date or the time of day?  What are you looking for? 
 
Q: Everything.  I want to know all the details. 
 
A: I would think it was probably approximately four weeks prior to 
the murder. 
 
Q: And you were home alone with Faye Resnick; true? 
 
A: That's correct, right. 
 
Q: And Faye had just gotten off the phone with O.J. Simpson and 
you overheard their conversation? 
 
A: Right. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Not both sides. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Rubalcava, I appreciate that you want to 
get out certain information, but I really am entitled to examine him. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Excuse me. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: And Mr. Leonard with whom this witness is 
fairly friendly -- 
 
MR. LEONARD: I object to that characterization. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, you can object, but it is true.  You have 
met with him twice.  He has talked to your client 100 times since 
he got out of jail.  It is clear what has been going on here and your 
client's effort to co-opt and convert witnesses and -- 
 
MR. LEONARD: That is not an appropriate comment. 
 
MR.PETROCELLI: -- you can do whatever you want when it is 
your time to examine him, but I am here trying to examine this 
witness, and I do not want you or his lawyer, frankly, impeding 
that effort. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I am not attempting to impede.  I just -- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's all I am trying to do. 
 
MR. LEONARD: -- am making a legitimate objection. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You should have nothing to hide because, as you have said 
before, you are sure that O.J. Simpson is innocent as you are of any 
other fact? 
 
A: Mr. Petrocelli, I don't have anything to hide. 
 
Q: Thank you.  So we are on the same wavelength? 
 
A: Exactly.  You are trying to do your job, and I am just telling 
you the truth. 
 
Q: Thank you.  So you were on the couch, the same couch that you 
were on the evening of June 12; right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And Faye Resnick was on that couch  talking to O.J. Simpson; 
right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Where was she? 
 
A: She was off to the left walking around the living room. 
 
Q: Was it a portable phone? 
 
A: She was on a portable phone. 
 
Q: Is it the same phone number as the one that you were using on 
the evening of June 12? 
 
A: Was it the same phone number? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: There are three phone numbers in the house that are ringing 
with that same phone number. 
 
Q: And who called who? 
 
A: I believe that it was O.J. calling Faye that evening. 
 
Q: O.J. of course is O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And Mr. Simpson called Faye Resnick around what time? 
 
A: It must have been after 8 o'clock because that is when I get 
home from the office. 
 
Q And when you got home, Ms. Resnick was already there; right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Was anyone else home? 
 
A: I believe her daughter was in her room. 
 
Q: And her daughter is Francesca? 
 
A: Francesca. 
 
Q: Do you know whether her daughter overheard Ms. Resnick on 
the phone with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: You didn't see her in the room? 
 
A: She was not in the room.  She was downstairs. 
 
Q: Did she overhear to your knowledge the ensuing conversation 
between you and Ms. Resnick? 
 
A: No, she did not. 
 
Q: And this event occurred about one month before the murder of 
Nicole and the murder of Ron; correct? 
 
A: Approximately.  Approximately, yes. 
 
Q: And this was after you had come back from Cabo? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And this was after your birthday party; true? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And this is after you had heard about a  split or a rift between 
Nicole and Mr. Simpson following the Cabo trip; right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You heard no such information at all as of this point in time? 
 
A: I knew that they were going through difficult times and that 
they were thinking about  splitting back up, yes. 
 
Q: Thinking of ending that one-year effort to reconcile? 
 
A: That's right. 
 
Q: Ms. Resnick was having an animated conversation with O.J. 
Simpson? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Correct? 
 
A: Ms. Resnick was high at the time so any conversation is 
animated with her. 
 
Q: I am not asking about drug use again.  Dan will, I am sure, elicit 
that.  I am only asking about your observations and what you heard 
and what you saw. 
 
A: All right.  Yes, Faye Resnick was distraught. 
 
Q: As she was talking to O.J. Simpson; correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And it was apparent to you from listening to Faye Resnick talk 
to O.J. Simpson that there was an upsetting conversation going on 
between both parties; right? 
 
A: Not really. 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection.  Lack of foundation. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Well, you did not get the impression from listening to Ms. 
Resnick that O.J. Simpson was talking about his golf game, right? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: But I had the impression that Ms. Resnick was 
high and she was animated when she was high. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I am not talking about her drug use again. 
 
A: I know you are not. 
 
Q: I am talking about the content of her conversation, the words, 
the subject matter, okay.  To your knowledge, based on what you 
recall, they were talking about the relationship between O.J. 
Simpson and Nicole; true? 
 
A: That's correct.  That's correct. 
 
Q: And Ms. Resnick in this discussion with O.J. Simpson about his 
relationship with Nicole was visibly upset and animated; true? 
 
A: But I don't know whether it was because of the content or her 
state of mind. 
 
Q: I didn't ask you that. 
 
A: I know. 
 
Q: That is for some other lawyer to ask you? 
 
A: It is not an answer I can do with yes or no. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Please repeat my question.  And regardless of 
what you think caused it, just give us the answer.  Someone else 
will present Mr. Simpson's side of the story. 
 
(Discussion was held between the witness and his counsel out of 
the hearing of the reporter.) 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let the record reflect that -- I am going to 
object to any more conferences while questions are pending. 
 
THE WITNESS: The question is not pending.  I answered the 
question. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I want the question read back, please.  I 
would like a "yes" or "no" answer. 
 
(The record was read as follows: 
 
"Q: And Ms. Resnick in this discussion with O.J. Simpson about 
his relationship with Nicole was visibly upset and animated; 
true?") 
 
THE WITNESS: That's correct. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: How long did the conversation between O.J. Simpson and Faye 
Resnick last? 
 
A: Approximately l0 minutes. 
 
Q: Had you spoken to O.J. Simpson that day? 
 
A: I spoke to him after that. 
 
Q: That same evening? 
 
A: (Witness nods head.) 
 
Q: You have to answer audibly. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Before the Resnick conversation had you  spoken to Mr. 
Simpson by phone that day? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Had you spoken to him in person that day? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Had you spoken to him the day before? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: And when the phone rang, who picked it up? 
 
A: Faye did. 
 
Q: Okay.  And Faye did not say to you, "Mr. Simpson wants to 
speak to you, Christian"; correct? 
 
A: No.  She wanted me to talk to him. 
 
Q: But Mr. Simpson had called to speak to Faye Resnick; true? 
 
A: That's right. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Lack of foundation. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: True? 
 
A: That's right. 
 
Q: In other words, at no point did Resnick tell you, "Here, he is 
calling to speak to you, Christian"; true? 
 
A: That's right. 
 
Q: And you did not get on that phone call at all; right? 
 
A: Yes, I got on the phone call later. 
 
Q: On the same call? 
 
A: No.  No.  Sorry.  Not that call.  
 
Q: A later call; right? 
 
A: A later call. 
 
Q: Let's stick with this phone call.  You did not get on this phone 
call; right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Tell me everything that you can remember Faye Resnick saying 
as you listened to her conversation with O.J. Simpson. 
 
A: I didn't listen into their conversation very much at all. 
 
Q: Tell me what you heard. 
 
A: I remember saying that --Faye saying that she was wanting to 
stay -- remain friends with O.J. regardless of what happens between 
Nicole and O.J. 
 
Q: And you remember specifically that that  was said by Faye in 
this conversation? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you understand that Faye had a concern that if O.J. 
Simpson and Nicole split up that she, Faye Resnick, would then 
lose her relationship and friendship with O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: Can you repeat the question, please. 
 
MR.PETROCELLI: Yes.  Please. 
 
(The record was read as follows: 
 
"Q: Did you understand that Faye had a concern that if O.J. 
Simpson and Nicole split up that she, Faye Resnick, would then 
lose her relationship and friendship with O.J. Simpson?") 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes, that's correct. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And she, based on your overhearing this conversation, was 
telling Mr. Simpson she did not want  to see that happen; correct? 
 
A: That's right. 
 
Q: In this conversation do you know whether there was any 
discussion of the Sports Spectacular event on July 4? 
 
A: I think that's what prompted the phone call from O.J. to Faye. 
 
Q: Why do you think that? 
 
A: Because later Faye and I were talking about it. 
 
Q: Okay. Before we get to what Faye and you  discussed, can you 
tell me anything else that you remember hearing in the O.J. 
Simpson/Faye Resnick conversation? 
 
A: They were just talking about the Spectacular, to go there 
together and to -- like I said, Faye was concerned not wanting to 
get into separation of the friendships, she is not wanting to lose 
either friend. 
 
Q: So by this time it was pretty clear to you that Mr. Simpson and 
Nicole Brown were splitting up; right? 
 
A: Yes, they were, I think, going through the moves of splitting up. 
 
Q: In fact, Mr. Simpson had already gotten together with his 
former girlfriend Paula Barbieri -- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- by this time; right? 
 
A: I think it was all about the same time. 
 
Q: With whom he was planning to take to the Sports Spectacular? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Not Nicole? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: So the whole issue that you overheard on this one point was 
Faye going to an event with Mr. Simpson without Nicole? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Okay.  Now, after -- First of all, have you told us everything that 
you can remember about the Resnick/Simpson conversation? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q Now, when Faye got off the phone, she then immediately told 
you what Mr. Simpson had just said; right? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: After the phone call after Faye hung up, she went 
over and hung the phone up in the kitchen, she came back to the 
couch and plopped  herself down on the couch -- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I thought you said it was a portable phone? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: But she put it in the kitchen? 
 
A: Right.  The base for the portable phone is in the kitchen.  Then 
she plopped herself on the couch and she said, "He said he is going 
to kill her." 
 
Q: What did you say? 
 
A: I said, "What do you mean?" 
 
Q: What did she say? 
 
A: She said, "He is going to kill her if she keeps doing this driving 
him crazy." 
 
Q: And what did you say? 
 
A: I said, "Well, you know, that is a figure of speech." 
 
Q: What is a figure of speech? 
 
A: That trying to kill someone. 
 
Q: How do you know? 
 
A: I used the terminology. 
 
Q: Have you ever told anyone that you were going to kill Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Had O.J. Simpson ever told you before this evening that he was 
going to kill Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Had he ever told you before this evening that he was going to 
kill Nicole when you construed that as a figure of speech -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- or in a joking way or in any other way; right? 
 
A: Right, no. 
 
Q: So the first time that you ever heard a statement attributed to 
Mr. Simpson that he was going to kill Nicole was on this evening 
of this conversation that Resnick had with Simpson and then 
reported to you; true? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: And did you ever hear that statement made after that evening -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- attributed to Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: That was a bad question.  Did you ever hear a statement 
attributed to Mr. Simpson that he was going to kill Nicole after this 
conversation that you just described? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So that was the only time that you heard it; true? 
 
A: That he said that he would kill Nicole, but it is a figure of 
speech -- 
 
Q: Forget the "but" part, okay. That is Dan's job. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I object to that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What was the beginning of my question?  
Give me the question and the answer. 
 
(The record was read as follows: 
 
"Q: So that was the only time that you heard it; true? 
 
"A. That he said that he would kill Nicole, but it is a figure of 
speech -- 
 
"Q. Forget the 'but' part, okay.") 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: So the only time that you heard a statement attributed by Mr. 
Simpson that he would kill Nicole was that evening? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And you were not on the phone with O.J. Simpson when Ms. 
Resnick was; right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Nor did you hear him talking when Ms. Resnick was speaking 
to Mr. Simpson; right? 
 
A: Right.  
 
Q: You were not listening on the other end; right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And you could not hear his voice, I take it? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
A: So you had no idea whether he meant it seriously, joking, figure 
of speech or otherwise; true? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me. 
 
Q: True. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: Since I did not listen to the voice, I cannot say. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: So can you answer my question?  True; is that right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: But you nonetheless told Faye Resnick that it was a figure of 
speech; right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Now, you have just told us that Faye Resnick told you that O.J. 
Simpson said he would kill Nicole; correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: What else did Faye Resnick tell you that O.J. Simpson said? 
 
A: That was it.  After that she went downstairs. 
 
Q: Was there any discussion of the Sports Spectacular event, 
whether Mr. Simpson said he would invite her, notwithstanding 
that Nicole would not be there, anything like that mentioned? 
 
A: That evening? 
 
Q: In this conversation now between you and Faye reporting on her 
just concluded conversation with Mr. Simpson. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, when Ms. Resnick told you what O.J. Simpson had said, 
it is fair to say that she appeared to you to be upset? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: True? 
 
A: Not any more or less upset than she usually was in her 
condition. 
 
Q: Well, aside from the reason for her being upset, she seemed to 
you to be distraught --true? -- 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: True? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- (Continuing) at the time that she reported the O.J. Simpson 
statement to you; true? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, you said that after she reported O.J. Simpson's statement 
that he would kill Nicole she went downstairs? 
 
A: After she had plopped herself on the couch she then went 
downstairs. 
 
Q When you say she plopped herself on the couch, how long was 
she down there on the couch with you? 
 
A: Thirty seconds. 
 
Q: And then she got up and walked away;  right?

A: No. 
 
Q: -- or that day? 
 
A: (Witness shakes head.)

the Resnick conversation?

A: Faye and I. 
 
Q: Anything else said? 
 
A: I think it was a very brief conversation. 
 
Q: So you cannot remember anything else?

A: I don't recall.  A big round table. 
 
Q: And did you pay? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Mr. Simpson pay? 
 
A: Yes.  I assume so.  I don't know who paid. 
 
Q: You didn't pay.  Do you know how much it cost him -- 
 
A: I have no idea. 
 
Q: -- for you and for Ms. Resnick? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Had you been there the year before in 1992? 
 
A: No.

A: No. 
 
Q: Did he ever talk to you about whether the gloves that were 
found at the Rockingham scene and the Bundy crime scene were 
his gloves? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or whether the shoe prints were his shoes? 
 
A: No.

video? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he ask your advice? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he ask for your opinions at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he ask whether you thought it would be a good or bad idea 
to make the video? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: You are talking about Mr. Simpson's post-
release video as opposed to the video that Mr. Reichardt consulted 
with on the exercise? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. I am talking about the video in which he 
tries to persuade people that he is innocent, that video, not the 
exercise video. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Okay. 
 
THE WITNESS: Right. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Now, you went to Cabo San Lucas with Mr. Simpson in April 
of 1994; right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Could you look at your calendar and tell me -- I think you told 
us what the dates were actually. 
 
A: Easter. 
 
Q: You told us it was March 31 through, I guess, April 3 or 4; is 
that right? 
 
A: Yes.  April 1 through the 4th. 
 
Q: How did you get to Cabo? 
 
A: I flew. 
 
Q Did you fly alone? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where did you stay there? 
 
A: We stayed at a house by the Palmilla Hotel. 
 
Q: And whose house was it? 
 
A: It was a rented house. 
 
Q: Did you pay for the rental? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Who paid? 
 
A: Mr. Simpson. 
 
Q: Who stayed in your particular condominium?  You and Ms. 
Resnick? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And Francesca? 
 
A: No.  Francesca was supposed to be staying over at the general 
house. 
 
Q: So just the two of you? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And when did Faye Resnick come down to Cabo? 
 
A: They left the day before me. 
 
Q: And when did O.J. Simpson go down there? 
 
A: I think they all went together with O.J. 
 
Q: So you came one day later? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And you stayed there until the 4th and you left on the 4th? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And did you leave alone? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And where did you go? 
 
A: Back to Los Angeles. 
 
Q: And do you know when Mr. Simpson left Cabo? 
 
A: He left the day before me. 
 
Q: On the 3rd? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did you take him to the airport? 
 
A: Yes, I did. 
 
Q: You drove him? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What kind of car? 
 
A: A VW bus. 
 
Q: To whom did it belong? 
 
A: I think it belonged to the house. 
 
Q: Did it have a phone in it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Mr. Simpson make any phone calls on that ride to the 
airport? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he use his portable phone to make any calls? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did anybody else take you to the airport -- go with you and Mr. 
Simpson to the airport? 
 
A: No.  It was just me.  I think it was just the two of us. 
 
Q: And he was going off to catch a plane to Puerto Rico? 
 
A: I think first back to LA. and then to Puerto Rico, however the 
transition was. 
 
Q: Did he give you a number where he could be reached in Puerto 
Rico? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he make plans to see you again? 
 
A: Yes, when his show was done, when his film was done in 
Puerto Rico. 
 
Q: Did he give you a date certain or event when you would next 
see each other? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he say how long he would be gone? 
 
A: I think he said about a week-and-a-half. 
 
Q: Now, can you tell us what you and Mr. Simpson did in Cabo 
San Lucas together during the three days that you were there? 
 
A: Everybody or him and I specifically? 
 
Q: Did the two of you ever spend any time alone other than going 
to the airport to take him to the airport? 
 
A: No.  It was always a whole group of people together. 
 
Q: Did you observe the interaction between Mr. Simpson and 
Nicole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And can you characterize it for us. 
 
A: It was very loving and happy.  They were -- they seemed pretty 
happy at the time. 
 
Q: Now, you testified Friday that you had already had 
conversations with Mr. Simpson about them being in an unhealthy 
relationship, or he was saying that to you and you were saying that 
to him about your respective relationships; is that -- 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Did it come to you as a surprise, then, to see Nicole and Mr. 
Simpson interacting so positively? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever have a chance to talk with Mr. Simpson about 
whether he had different feelings now about his relationship and 
his plans? 
 
A: In Cabo? 
 
Q: Yes, in Cabo. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Including on the way to the airport. 
 
A: Just something that I thought it was -- I mentioned to him, I 
think on the way to the airport, that I thought it was great that they 
were getting along. 
 
Q: What did he say? 
 
A: He felt happy.  He felt good.  He had a good time in Cabo. 
 
Q: Did he say, "You know, I think I'm going to stay with her and 
have her move back in?" 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: "I think it is now going to work out"? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he tell you that it was not going to work out? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So he gave you no idea one way or the other what was going to 
happen with his relationship insofar as he was concerned? 
 
A: At that moment, right. 
 
Q: Was there an episode or incident that occurred when Mr. 
Simpson was talking to Nicole about frogs and about his being the 
FROGMAN? 
 
A: There was a time when we discussed his role as the 
FROGMAN where everybody was sitting out on the patio, and he 
was basically saying that it was funny that Nicole had this fear of 
frogs and here he is doing this role as the FROGMAN and 
everybody was laughing about it. 
 
Q: Did Nicole laugh? 
 
A: Absolutely. 
 
Q: Did Nicole show any signs of being upset by this? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she say anything to Mr. Simpson about that comment? 
 
A: I think everybody was just jesting around with the comment. 
 
Q: Who made the comment, Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: Yes.  Actually, I think it was talk between O.J. and Faye that 
started it, you know, was the start of it, "What are you reading for?  
What is the script?  What is it about?"  You know, and that is  how 
the conversation started. 
 
Q: And Mr. Simpson made a comment in this conversation that 
"Isn't it funny how Nicole is afraid of frogs and I am playing the 
role of FROGMAN"? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you did not see any signs of Nicole being upset by that? 
 
A: Not at all. 
 
Q: Did Faye comment to you later on about Nicole's reaction to 
that comment? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you see Mr. Simpson flirt with any other women during 
that time in Cabo? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you see him talk to any other women? 
 
A: No.  Just our group, that was it. 
 
Q: Did Mr. Simpson describe any of the script in FROGMAN or 
the scenes in FROGMAN or the actions he would perform? 
 
A: He only described briefly what kind of script it was. 
 
Q: What did he say? 
 
A: That it was a script about an aging military guy that is putting 
together a team and like a detective-type story. 
 
Q: Did he tell you that it was written by an ex-Navy seal man? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did he tell you about his conversations with this ex-Navy seal 
man? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he tell you his name? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he show you any movements or actions with a knife? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Can you recall any conversations that you had with Mr. 
Simpson about his relationship with Nicole during this Cabo trip? 
 
A: Other than the brief comment on the way  back to the airport, 
no. 
 
Q: And did you have any discussions with either Nicole or Faye 
Resnick about Nicole's relationship with Mr. Simpson during this 
trip? 
 
A: Just that Faye and I thought that it was good to see them having 
a good time, enjoying each other. 
 
Q: You said that to one another? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Now, after you went back to Los Angeles, when was the next 
time you heard from Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: That I spoke to him in person? 
 
Q: No, not in person.  Spoke to him either in person or over the 
telephone or received a fax from him or any communication. 
 
A: April 30th I talked to him in person over the phone. 
 
Q: That was the next time? 
 
A: That was my birthday party, right. 
 
Q: So it was about a month later? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And between April 3 and April 30 you had no contact at all 
with O.J. Simpson -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- is that true? 
 
A: That's right. 
 
Q: Now, your party was at your condominium on [Address 
Deleted]; correct? 
 
A: That's right. 
 
Q: And had that party been planned to your knowledge by Faye 
Resnick? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And had it been planned to your knowledge as early as the trip 
to Cabo? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Was there any talk about that party? 
 
A: No.  I think initially she wanted to make it a surprise party, but 
then later it turned out not to be a surprise party. 
 
Q: How many people attended? 
 
A: Thirty people, thirty-five people. 
 
Q: All right.  And did Mr. Simpson arrive at that party with 
Nicole? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And they arrived together? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did you understand that he had just returned from Puerto Rico? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And how did you know that? 
 
A: I think Faye was telling me that -- Well, actually the reason why 
the birthday party was moved  from my birthday the 28th to the 
30th was because O.J. was going to come back a 
couple of days late. 
 
Q: Why was the party moved?  Just to accommodate O.J. 
Simpson? 
 
A: Faye thought that that is what she wanted to do. 
 
Q: Where is the calendar for that period of time? 
 
A: Right here. 
 
Q: Let me see that for a second.  Your birthday was on April 28th? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Which was a Thursday? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And it was moved to April 30th, Saturday? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Now, did you speak to Mr. Simpson at that party? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you speak to him alone at all? 
 
A: No.  We were sitting on the couch. 
 
Q: Did you observe the interaction between Mr. Simpson and 
Nicole? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And can you describe it for us, please. 
 
A: He was sitting on a chair at the moment and Nicole was sitting 
in front of him on the floor so -- and they were -- they seemed to 
enjoy their time.  They just had a good time. 
 
Q: Was that the last time that you saw them together? 
 
A:  Yes, I believe so.  I believe so.  We might have had another 
dinner in between, but I don't recall. 
 
Q: Did you say you had no private conversation with Mr. Simpson 
at that time? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Now, the next day, did you talk to him about the party or about 
his relationship with Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you remember the next time that you spoke to O.J. Simpson 
after April 30 when you saw him at the party? 
 
A: Yes.  I believe in the next couple of days after the party.  Not 
the first day but the next couple of days afterwards. 
 
Q: In the beginning of May? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And what was the occasion? 
 
A: Like I said, checking in with each other as friends to see how 
the other one was doing, and he was talking to me about how 
Nicole would be one day happy, one day not happy, one day 
everything would be fine, one day they had a fight, and he was just 
talking about how he doesn't want to do that anymore, he doesn't 
want to have that in his life anymore. 
 
Q: Now, tell me when that conversation occurred.  And if you need 
to, look at your calendar, the one that you just described. 
 
A: Like I said, it must have been in the next few days after the 
birthday party. 
 
Q: Was it a telephone call? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did that -- 
 
A: Several calls over, you know, a few days' period of time. 
 
Q: Can you separate them out in your mind or do they all run 
together? 
 
A: They all pretty much run together. 
 
Q: In these collective conversations Mr. Simpson talked to you 
about the problems he was having with Nicole; true? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Did this come as a surprise to you given that you had last 
observed them interacting positively on your birthday on April 30 
and the immediately prior time you saw them together was in Cabo 
and they also interacted positively together? 
 
A: No, it didn't seem strange to me. 
 
A: And you had not talked to him at all about his relationship? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Had you heard from Faye Resnick or from Nicole about what 
was happening between Mr. Simpson and Nicole? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Object to the compound question. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes and no.  Sorry.  I don't know how to answer 
with one. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Had you heard from Nicole about what was happening in her 
relationship with Mr. Simpson about the Cabo trip and your 
birthday party on April 30? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You had no discussions at all with Nicole -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- about that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Had you had any interaction at all with Nicole between Cabo 
and April 30? 
 
A: Very little.  Very little. 
 
Q: What do you remember? 
 
A: Just that she would come over and pick up the kids, if I would 
go over there and pick up Francesca, drop off Francesca, just to 
play with the kids. 
 
Q: Anything beyond that? 
 
A: No.  I doubt it. 
 
Q Did you talk with Faye Resnick between Cabo and your birthday 
party on April 30th about the relationship between Mr. Simpson 
and Nicole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you have a number of  conversations? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did you learn about the relationship in those 
conversations? 
 
A: That it was going up and down. 
 
Q: What did Faye tell you? 
 
A: That they were going through difficult times. 
 
Q: Well, Mr. Simpson was off filming something in Puerto Rico? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did you question how they could be going through difficult 
times -- 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: -- since he is not even with her? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: What did she say? 
 
A: Well, Mr. Simpson would talk to Faye on the phone and ask 
Faye why Nicole would be reacting certain ways, the way that she 
was, and then Faye would relay to me how Nicole and O.J. were 
going through difficult times. 
 
A: When you got back from Cabo, how long thereafter did Faye 
Resnick return? 
 
A: I returned on a Monday.  I believe she returned on a Friday. 
 
Q: April what? 
 
A: 7th. 
 
Q: Or thereabouts? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you and she talk over the telephone during the four or five 
days that you were in Los  Angeles and she was still in Cabo? 
 
A: Perhaps once. 
 
Q: Was your conversation about Nicole's relationship with Mr. 
Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q And when she came back, did she talk to you about that subject? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q Did she tell you, "By the way, Nicole is splitting up with O.J. or 
is thinking about splitting up"? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she tell you that Nicole had met a man in Cabo? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she tell you about a man named Brett? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever heard about a man named  Brett that Nicole 
and/or Faye Resnick met in Cabo? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: To this day you have no knowledge about a man named Brett? 
 
A: The only knowledge I have is what I read in Faye's book.  
That's all. 
 
Q: When you read it, what did you think in terms of whether that 
was true or not? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Lack of foundation. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did you ask her or anybody any questions about it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What did you read in her book? 
 
A: That Faye and Nicole had met two people down in Cabo and 
that Nicole ended up spending the night with one of them. 
 
Q: So when you heard that for the first time, or read that, you did 
not check into that or ask anyone about it; right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, did there come a time when following Faye Resnick's 
return from Cabo she told you about problems in Nicole's 
relationship with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did she tell you? 
 
A: Just that they were having problems, they were going through 
difficult times. 
 
Q: Did she explain why? 
 
A: No. 
 
A: Did she explain anything that had caused these problems? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You do not remember any information she gave you at all? 
 
A: It is not that I don't remember.  I didn't talk to Faye much at that 
time. 
 
Q: Well, you just said that she was talking with you about these 
problems. 
 
A: Briefly.  You are asking me what all the things she said.  At that 
time Faye and I did not interact very well at all, so whatever small 
polite conversations we had it was just they were having problems 
and I would say, well, okay, so I did not  check into anything, I did 
not have lengthy conversations with her. 
 
Q: And you did not contact Mr. Simpson either -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- to find out what was going on from his end; right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: But you did know that Mr. Simpson was having telephone 
conversations with Faye Resnick about this; right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And those calls were coming into the condominium; is that 
correct? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you would be there when Faye was talking to him; right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Including when Mr. Simpson was in Puerto  Rico; right? 
 
A: I don't know that -- which calls that he had, whether they were 
from Puerto Rico or not. 
 
Q: And there were a large number of calls during this time period? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: They were probably talking once or twice a 
week, lengthy, right in -- right in the times right after Cabo. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And at no time, by the way, did you pick up the phone to talk to 
Mr. Simpson during these conversations he had with Faye Resnick; 
right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And you could overhear from Ms. Resnick's side of the 
conversation that they were talking about, the problems that he was 
having with Nicole; right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And did you then inquire to Faye what was going on? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Could you tell from listening to one-half of the conversation 
what was going on?  Did you get  the gist of it, in other words? 
 
A: Yes.  The gist of it was Faye trying to remain friends with both 
of them. 
 
A: Wasn't the gist of it that O.J. Simpson was trying to find out 
from Faye what was going on with Nicole? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Don't you remember that? 
 
A: I think that was part of it, yes. 
 
Q: And don't you remember that Mr. Simpson was getting no 
communication or receiving no communication from Nicole 
following the Cabo trip and he was trying to find out from Faye 
what had happened to her since they had such a good time together 
in Cabo? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: Right.  And it just was also Faye trying to explain 
to O.J. why she and I were having problems, and that was basically 
the gist, two people talking about their respective difficulties in 
relationships. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Now, do you recall explanations or reasons that Faye Resnick 
gave to Mr. Simpson on the phone as to why Nicole was behaving 
the way she was? 
 
A: The gist of it was that Nicole just needed some time and space 
and Faye was trying to explain that to O.J. 
 
Q: Do you know whether Nicole was seeing a counselor or a 
therapist during this time frame? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: By "this time frame" I mean April, May, and into June of 1994? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Faye see a counselor or a therapist during this time frame? 
 
A: No, not to my knowledge. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, you said that there came a time when you then had 
some conversations with Mr. Simpson, and I guess it was a couple 
of days after your party in the first week of May; right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you said you had a couple of them and you cannot separate 
them out, that they all kind of run together; right? 
 
A: Right.  We had several, more than a couple. 
 
Q: Now, apart from these telephone calls, did you ever have a time 
from your party through June 12 when you and O.J. Simpson sat 
down together and had a lengthy conversation about his problems 
with Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever have any conversation about Nicole in person with 
Mr. Simpson from April 30 to June 12? 
 
A: Can you repeat that.  Whether I had -- 
 
Q: Yes.  I am trying to figure out whether you were ever alone with 
Mr. Simpson in person where you talked about his problems or his 
relationship with Nicole from the date of your party until Nicole's 
death on June 12? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever see him at all during that time frame? 
 
A: Yes.  I think we had a couple of dinners together. 
 
Q: Who went out for those dinners? 
 
A: Faye, Nicole, O.J., and I. 
 
Q: Can you identify the dates of those dinners? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Can you look at your calendar to see if that refreshes your 
recollection? 
 
A: I don't put dinner dates in here. 
 
Q: Do you know for a fact that there were such dinners following 
your party? 
 
A: I am pretty certain. 
 
Q: Why? 
 
A: Because that is what we used to do. 
 
Q: But this was a time when you and Faye were not talking to one 
another and when you were hearing that O.J. Simpson and Nicole 
were having problems; right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: But you still believe that given those facts that there were these 
dinners that the four of you went out on, or could it be that that was 
before the Cabo trip? 
 
A: It could be that it was before the Cabo trip.  I know that four 
people -- exactly Ron and Cora also as a group of friends were still 
trying to figure out how to work things out. 
 
Q: But as you sit here today you cannot specifically recall going 
out with Mr. Simpson to an event, whether it be a dinner or 
something else, between April 30 your birthday and June 12; true? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: And these dinners that you just mentioned might well have 
occurred before the Cabo trip -- right?  -- and not after the Cabo 
trip? 
 
A: Yes.  I am trying to figure it out in my head where these dates 
were. 
 
Q: And Cora and Ron Fischman were also having their difficulties, 
too; right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: By the way, did you speak to Ron Fischman at all about this 
problem that he was having with Cora? 
 
A: When? 
 
Q: Let's say, any time after your birthday party through June 12th. 
 
A: I don't recall a particular time. 
 
Q: You don't recall? 
 
A: A particular time that I talked to him, but like I said, in that time 
we were trying to -- everybody was trying to figure out -- 
 
Q: Did you spend any time with Mr. Fischman alone? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know whether he knew before June 12 of his wife's 
affair with [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: I don't believe that he knew. 
 
Q: Did you ever talk to Mr. Simpson about whether -- about that 
situation? 
 
A: About what situation? 
 
Q: Cora Fischman, Ron Fischman and [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: At what time? 
 
Q: After your birthday party -- 
 
A: After my birthday party. 
 
Q: -- before June 12? 
 
A: Yes, I am sure that we did. 
 
Q: Why are you sure? 
 
A: Because it was the other couple that was involved in a similar 
type of situation. 
 
Q: Can you remember any time when you were together with Mr. 
Simpson at all in person after your birthday party and before June 
12th? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And it may well be that the two of you did not see each other in 
person during that time frame? 
 
A: Right.  But talked over the phone quite a bit. 
 
Q: When you say "quite a bit," you were not close friends with him 
during this time frame? 
 
A: We were getting closer at the time because we were going 
through two similar things. 
 
Q: Did you take another trip to Cabo in May? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Do you want to look at your calendar and tell me when that trip 
occurred. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Can we turn the air conditioner down. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Sure. 
 
(Discussion held off the record.) 
 
THE WITNESS: That was May 27 through the 30th, Memorial 
Day weekend. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Where did he stay in Cabo? 
 
A: At the Palmina Hotel. 
 
Q: Did you pay for that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Who did you go with? 
 
A: The [Name Deleted] family. 
 
Q: Is that [Name Deleted] ? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And who else? 
 
A: Faye. 
 
Q: And anyone else? 
 
A: The kids. 
 
Q: Francesca? 
 
A: Francesca. 
 
Q: And the [Name Deleted] children? 
 
A: And the [Name Deleted] children.  And one of  the [Name 
Deleted] daughter's is called Nicole, her boyfriend. 
 
Q: Anyone else? 
 
A: No.  That was it. 
 
Q: So your relationship with Faye had not obviously ended by this 
time; right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Was there any conversations with Nicole over the telephone 
during this trip to Cabo -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- that either you or Faye had? 
 
A: That I had, no.  That Faye had, I don't know. 
 
Q: And did you have any conversations with Mr. Simpson during 
this time frame? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And do you recall whether you and the [Name Deleted]s and 
Faye Resnick were discussing the Simpsons and their relationship 
-- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: --and what was going on in it?  No? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, prior to June 12 did you ever have any conversation with 
Mr. Simpson about the IRS issue that he was confronting Nicole 
about? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you know about it? 
 
A: I knew about it from Faye. 
 
Q: What did Faye tell you? 
 
A: That Nicole was trying to have a residence at O.J.'s house 
because of some tax-related issue. 
 
Q: What did she tell you about O.J. Simpson's conduct toward 
Nicole in that regard? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection.  Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I didn't talk to her much about it. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did you know that Mr. Simpson was threatening her with IRS 
action?  "Her," Nicole that is. 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Misstates the evidence. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You didn't know that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you know that Mr. Simpson had told Nicole that he would 
take every last penny that she had and put her out on the street? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Would that surprise you to learn that he had said such a thing to 
her? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did he ever express to you that kind of hostility or venom about 
Nicole in his conversations with you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Would it surprise you to learn that he sent a letter to Nicole 
telling her that she should refrain from getting him in trouble with 
the IRS? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: Would it surprise me -- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Right. 
 
A: -- if I knew that -- 
 
Q: Exactly.  That he had gone that far as to write a letter with 
lawyers and so forth and have it hand-delivered by messenger to 
her home a week before she was killed. 
 
A: Yes, I think it would surprise me. 
 
Q: Did he tell you that he was doing so? 
 
A: (Witness shakes head.) 
 
Q: Did he tell about that letter? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he tell you about a letter that he had written to Nicole 
saying you know, stay away from my housekeeper," did he tell you 
about that letter? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he tell you about all of the events for his children that he 
was not attending in the first two weeks of June because he was out 
of town? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did he tell you that he was missing important events for his 
children -- 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: -- (continuing) while he was playing golf with rich people in the 
East? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: No? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he tell you about his trip to Connecticut? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he tell you about going to the Forschner board meeting and 
picking up knives and watches there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he tell you about his friend [Name Deleted] in New York? 
 
A: I know [Name Deleted] from New York but I am not quite 
understanding -- 
 
Q: Prior to June 12 -- These are the things that were going on in 
Mr. Simpson's life, and I am trying to find out whether he shared 
any of these with you at all. 
 
A: No.  I just knew, as I said on Friday, that he was going on a trip 
towards the East Coast and I thought it was Florida. 
 
Q: And he told you nothing about coming back on Sunday for a 
recital? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And he never even mentioned the recital to you; right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he tell you about this event that he attended with Ms. 
Barbieri on Saturday night? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Where the then First Lady of Israel was in attendance? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he tell you about the fight he had with Paula Barbieri or 
argument, conflict with her? 
 
A: No.

Q: Did he tell you about any of his interaction with Ms. Barbieri on 
Memorial Day weekend? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he tell you that he even saw her on Memorial Day 
weekend? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he tell you what he did on Memorial Day weekend? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Faye talk to you about Nicole hanging up on O.J. Simpson 
in the last 10 days of Nicole's life? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, before you went away to Cabo on Memorial Day 
weekend, Faye was not sleeping over Nicole's house then; right? 
This was after Memorial Day weekend; right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: So you got back from the Memorial Day trip to Cabo when? 
 
A: The 30th. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: Memorial Day, the evening. 
 
Q: And Faye spent June 8th at your house, the night of the 
intervention; right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And on the morning of the 9th you took  her to Exodus; right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: The evening of the 30th you and Faye spent together at your 
condominium; right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: The evening of June 7th Faye spent at the [Name Deleted]s, is 
that right? 
 
A: The evening of the 7th, Tuesday, right. 
 
Q: Or was it at your place? 
 
A: No. I am pretty sure that she spent it at Nicole's -- or at the 
[Name Deleted]s. 
 
Q: The [Name Deleted]s; right? The 7th right? 
 
A: At that time she was staying at different people's houses. 
 
Q: What I am trying to find out is how many nights can you tell us 
for sure that Faye Resnick spent at the home of Nicole on Bundy?  
And we now have narrowed it down starting with May 31 through 
June 6th -- May 31, June 1, June 2, June 3, June 4, June 5, June 6.  
There is seven days their, okay. 
 
Now, during those seven days tell us how many of them you know 
for sure that Faye spent at the house of Nicole? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: And how many she spent at the house of the [Name Deleted]s? 
 
A: I think she only spent one night at the [Name Deleted]s. 
 
Q: And you think that that was what night? 
 
A: I don't know.  I'm not sure.  And actually the days before Cabo 
at times she would spend time at Nicole's. 
 
Q: I am now talking about when she, in effect, moved out of your 
place as you were testifying about on Friday.  Okay? 
 
A: I am not Faye's keeper.  I don't know where she spent her 
nights. 
 
Q: But you do know if she is not spending them with you? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: You slept at the [Address Deleted] condominium during this 
entire period of time -- 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: -- as opposed to some other place; right? 
 
A: No.  Actually the 4th and 5th I went to San Diego. 
 
Q: June 4th and June 5th you were out of town those two nights? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: So you do not know whether Faye spent those in her condo or 
not; right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: You never took her keys away; right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So it is fair to say that you don't know how many nights she 
spent at Nicole's house during the first 12 days of June; true? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: You do not even know if she spent any nights there, do you? 
 
A: That's right.  Well, no, that is not correct. I know that she called 
me in San Diego, repeatedly throughout the night from Nicole's 
house. 
 
Q: What night was that? 
 
A: That would be Saturday the 4th.   
 
Q: And what was the -- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Off the record for a second. 
 
(Discussion held off the record.) 
 
MR.PETROCELLI: Back on. What was the last question that I 
asked? 
 
(The record was read as follows: 
 
"Q: What night was that? 
 
That would be Saturday the 4th.") 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: What was Faye calling you about repeatedly on the evening of 
June 4? 
 
A: She was checking in whether I was having somebody over, and 
we were having a friend over, a girl over at this friend's of mine 
place in San Diego. 
 
Q: Who were you staying with? 
 
A: [Name Deleted]  
 
Q: She thought you were seeing another woman or something? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did you tell her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, did she tell you what she and Faye Resnick -- what she 
and Nicole were doing that evening? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: During this period of time, let's say, starting from after your 
birthday party, May and up through the first 12 days of June when 
Nicole was killed, did you come across any information from 
anybody -- Mr. Simpson, Mr. Fischman, Cora Fischman, Nicole, 
whoever -- that Faye Resnick was having any kind of relationship, 
intimate relationship with Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or that Faye Resnick and Nicole were having intimate relations 
with other men, threesomes? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Anything like that? 
 
A: (Witness shakes head.) 
 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or that they were going with dangerous people? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or that they were going out with people who you felt might be a 
threat to their safety? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or that they had received any threats on their lives? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or anyone had threatened them? 
 
A: (Witness shakes head.) 
 
Q: "Them" of course being Nicole and Faye Resnick? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So it is fair to say that prior to June 12 you did not receive any 
information whatsoever that in your mind led you to believe that 
Faye's life was in danger; true? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Or that Nicole's life was in danger; true? 
 
A: Right. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: We can break here for lunch. 
 
(At the hour of 12:33 p.m. a luncheon recess was taken, the 
deposition resume at 1:30 p.m.) 
 
(At the hour of 1:50 p.m. the  deposition of CHRISTIAN H. 
REICHARDT was resumed at the same place, the same persons 
being present with the exception of Mr. Fredric Goldman.) 
 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibits 169 through 172 were marked for 
identification by the reporter are attached hereto.) 
 
EXAMINATION (Resumed) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Mr. Reichardt, you gave a statement to the District Attorney's 
office on November 29, 1994; right? 
 
A: Yes. I believe that's the date. 
 
Q: With Christopher Darden and investigator Dana Thompson? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And your attorney Mr. Rubalcava was present? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did you answer all the questions truthfully? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you did not omit anything important in response to the 
questions; right? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: Not that I am aware. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And you would have said the same thing had you been under 
oath; right? 
 
A: Absolutely. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: I think you were sworn, weren't you? 
 
THE WITNESS: I was sworn in. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You were put under oath? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: I believe so, and I believe there was a court 
reporter there. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
MR. LEONARD: It does not indicate that in the transcript. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It says at the beginning of the transcript on 
page 1, it says "Christian Reichardt, called as a witness, testified as 
follows," but it does not literally indicate whether you were put 
under oath. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: But he was. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: But you would have said the same thing and 
your lawyer has indicated that you were put under oath. Okay. 
 
I am not going to bother marking this as an exhibit to the 
deposition, but let me just ask you a question or two. 
 
Q: At page 16 of the transcript of that interview you were asked 
about the phone calls between O.J. Simpson and Faye Resnick that 
were made to your residence and specifically about the phone call 
in which Mr. Simpson said he would kill Nicole. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I object to the characterization. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And you said on page 16 starting at line 11, "I think he called 
her.  At that time for about a two-week period of time Faye and 
O.J. would talk on the phone for hours, each other calling."  That's 
true -- right? --  that that's what happened? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: You say down at line 18, "And I think O.J. was trying to find 
out what's up with Nicole, because if he would call Nicole he 
couldn't talk to her.  Faye was one of -- was Nicole's best friend at 
the time and O.J. was trying to find out where Nicole's head's at, so 
he would call the house and get into these long conversations with 
Faye about what's happening with Nicole and him."  And all of that 
is true; correct? 
 
A: (Witness nods head.) 
 
Q: That is what O.J. Simpson was trying to do; right? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Lack of foundation. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: True? 
 
A: I think they were both trying to do that. 
 
Q: But what you said here, what I just read to you was true; right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: That wasn't a lie, right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You were not making that up; right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: On page 23 of the transcript you are talking about a telephone 
conversation that you had with O.J. Simpson, I think the last time 
you spoke to him before Nicole's death, and starting at line 9, the 
question was, "He called your house?"  And your answer, "Yeah, 
actually Faye called to tell O.J. to talk to me." And then -- I will 
continue. 
 
"That I am such a terrible person for not marrying her.  So O.J. got 
on the phone and, you know, Faye brought the phone up to me and 
O.J. and I talked about  that. I said, 'I don't 
know what's wrong with our ladies.'  And I said, 'Faye is definitely 
going off the deep end here.'  And O.J. said, 'and I'm splitting 
town, you know, I don't want to deal with this anymore, I'm getting 
out of this."'  That is true; right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I am just going to object that -- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: That is what O.J. Simpson said to you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. LEONARD: -- it mischaracterizes his earlier testimony. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: That is what O.J. Simpson said to you; right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: He said, "I'm splitting town, you know, I don't want to deal with 
this anymore, I'm getting out of this"; true? 
 
A: Right 
 
Q: And he said this to you in a telephone call; true? 
 
A: He talked about the same kind of issue over a period of time, 
yes. 
 
(Telephone interruption ) 
 
(Discussion held off the record.) 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Could I have his last answer read back. 
 
(The record was read as follows:  A: He talked about the same kind 
of issue over a period of time, yes.") 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You told the prosecutor that O.J. Simpson said to you, "I'm 
splitting town, you know, I don't want to deal with this anymore, 
I'm getting out of this"?  It is true that O.J. Simpson said that to 
you; right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And he said that to you in the last telephone conversation that 
you and he had weeks before the murder; correct? 
 
A: One of the last.  I don't specifically recall whether it was the 
last, but it was in that  
time period.  That was the gist of the conversation, yes. 
 
Q: And O.J. Simpson told you in substance that Nicole was driving 
him crazy; correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: In this same conversation and series of conversations; correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: By the way, it was Faye who broke off the relationship or the 
engagement with you, not the other way around; true? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Isn't it true that on the second trip to Cabo it was Faye who said, 
"As far as I am concerned, our engagement was off"; isn't that 
true? 
 
A: That's correct. And then two hours later she came and 
apologized profusely. 
 
Q: Well, you told the prosecutors as follows: 
 
"Question by Darden: Well, who was it that broke off the 
engagement? You? 
 
"Answer: No. 
 
"Question: Okay. 
 
"Answer: It was Faye.  Our trip, second trip to Mexico, not with 
the Simpsons, that she walked into the room after we had flown 
down there with friends and she just said, 'as far as I am concerned, 
our engagement is off."'  That is the end of the answer.  That is the 
testimony that you gave to the prosecutors -- right? -- the statements 
that you gave to the prosecutor; correct? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And that statement was correct; right? 
 
A: But not finished.  Nobody asked me further to explain that later 
Faye came and apologized and was wanting to try to get back 
together. 
 
Q: But that statement that you made was true? 
 
A: That's correct, right. 
 
Q: I want to ask you whether Nicole ever told you about a phone 
call that she had with O.J. Simpson and then a subsequent 
conversation on June 3 and on June 2 of 1994. 
 
Have you ever seen these notes before?  They are notes in Nicole's 
handwriting. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Nicole's entry starts with Sunday, May  22, 1994.  It says, 
"We've officially split.  I told O.J. we are going back to every other 
weekend."  And then she talks about arrangements for the children. 
 
Did you ever have any conversations with Nicole about her official 
split with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you have any conversations with Mr. Simpson about that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: With Faye Resnick? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you know that Mr. Simpson had given Nicole some very 
valuable jewelry? 
 
A: I heard about it. 
 
Q: From? 
 
A: Faye. 
 
Q: And did you know that Nicole returned that jewelry to him 
when she broke off the relationship for good? 
 
A: I knew that Nicole had given it back to him. 
 
Q: When did you find that out? 
 
A: Probably in the middle of May, approximately middle of May. 
 
Q: From whom? 
 
A: From Faye. 
 
Q: Did she tell you why? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she tell you what jewelry it was? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she tell you the circumstances under which it was given to 
Nicole by Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you have any understanding why Mr. Simpson would give 
Nicole such valuable jewelry for her birthday in the middle of May 
of 1994? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Object. Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And did you have any information as to the circumstances 
concerning why Nicole returned the jewelry? 
 
A: As far as I knew, Nicole and O.J. were going through difficult 
times so I have no knowledge as to why she would have done that, 
no. 
 
Q: Do you have any knowledge as to why Mr. Simpson would be 
giving her this valuable jewelry if he were trying to truly move on 
with his life? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: No? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Are you aware of any blowup in the car between O.J. Simpson 
and Cora Fischman? 
 
A: (Witness shakes head.) 
 
Q: Any argument between them in the last months of Nicole's life? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you have conversations with Cora directly? 
 
A: No.  Since when? 
 
Q: Before Nicole's death. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And you have seen her -- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- since Mr. Simpson's release from jail? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: She is a patient of yours? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you talked about Mr. Simpson from time to time? 
 
A: Rarely. 
 
A: Did you hear from anyone about O.J. Simpson's not taking the 
kids or being attentive to the kids in the last month of Nicole's life? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And did you hear about Nicole hanging up on O.J. on June 2? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, Nicole writes in these notes, and I don't know exactly 
what to call these other than her notes on June 3, "O.J. came to 
pick up kids at 8:30 p.m.  They wanted to stay home because I let 
them organize sleepovers at last minute, thought daddy wasn't 
coming.  Told O.J. I would drop them off first thing in the 
morning."  Did you come across any information about that 
incident? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection.  Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Let me read on, and perhaps it will refresh your recollection. 
 
"He," referring to O.J., "said okay."  Then, quoting O.J. Simpson, 
"You hung up on me last night.  You are going to pay for this, 
Bitch.  You are holding money from the IRS. You are going to jail, 
you f******g c**t.  You think you can do any freaking thing you 
want.  You've got it coming.  I have already talked to my lawyers 
about this, Bitch.  They will get you for tax evasion, Bitch.  I will 
see to it.  You are not going to have a f***ing dime left, Bitch," et 
cetera.  Now, did you ever come across any information about this 
confrontation between O.J. Simpson and Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection.  Lack of foundation. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Do you have any information as to whether Nicole would make 
up something like this? 
 
A: No 
 
Q Did you know her to make up things in her conversations or 
dealings with you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you know her to fabricate events that did not occur? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you know her to lie to you? 
 
A: Obviously. 
 
Q: About? 
 
A: About her interactions with Faye. 
 
Q: Not telling you about Faye's taking of drugs, assuming she was 
taking drugs? 
 
A: And having their intimacy.  There's a number of things. 
 
Q: But rather than not telling you certain  things, did you know her 
to affirmatively make up things that did not occur -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- that were a complete fabrication and figment of her 
imagination? 
 
A: No. 
Q Did you ever have that experience with her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Mr. Simpson ever tell you that Nicole had done such 
things? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection.  Lack of foundation. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Has anyone ever told you that Nicole made up such things -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q -- or would make things up against O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Have you ever discussed with Mr. Simpson his belief as 
testified to in his deposition that  Nicole invented all of these 
things because she had a vivid imagination? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When Mr. Simpson told you that Nicole was driving him nuts 
and that he was going to split town and get himself out of it, he did 
not tell you about his fight with Nicole over the IRS issue? 
 
A: (Witness shakes head.) 
 
Q: Or any other issue? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Her seeing other men? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: He did not express any feelings to you about what she was 
doing and how it affected him? 
 
A: No.  The conversation was about that it  was not working out 
between them and he was leaving. 
 
Q: Okay.  While we were off the record, I had marked as Exhibit 
169 your Day-Timer for the period July to December of 1994. 
 
Will you confirm that that is Exhibit 169? 
 
A: Yes, it is. 
 
Q: And Exhibit 170 your Day-Timer for January through June of 
1995, will you confirm that? 
 
A: Yes, it is. 
 
Q And Exhibit 171 your Day-Timer for July to December of 1995, 
will you confirm that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And I attached as Exhibit 172 the notes that you made in 
contemplation of writing the book about the O.J. Simpson case; is 
that right? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Exhibit 172? 
 
A: It is not about the O.J. Simpson case. 
 
Q: What is it about? 
 
A: It is a book about ethics and how people interact and what they 
do in their life. 
 
Q: But the genesis of it is the O.J. Simpson case; right? 
 
A: The genesis of it is the course of events that happened at that 
point in my life. 
 
Q: Starting with this O.J. Simpson situation -- right? -- Nicole's 
death, his being accused of it, and the ethical issues that have been 
in your mind spawned as a result of that; right? 
 
A: No. Actually, the thought process happened way before this 
case, and a lot of the thoughts had come out of the relationship that 
I had with Faye and prior to. 
 
Q: Well, the truth of the matter is before the O.J. case, and by that I 
mean before Nicole's death and Mr. Simpson standing accused for 
her murder, you never wrote down any of these notes, did you? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: These notes all came about after the O.J. Simpson situation? 
 
A: The notes came.  The thought process was before that. 
 
Q: But you never really got serious enough to put pen to paper 
until the O.J. Simpson -- 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: -- situation; right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And you were going to do a book deal on these notes; right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you were actually contemplating doing a co-authorship 
with Faye Resnick? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You never discussed that with her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, all of the notes here, and a number a of pages are in 
typewritten form and a number are handwritten are all yours; right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: All of the statements are yours; right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And nobody helped you write them; right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: There is a symbol that I am pointing to on one of the 
handwritten pages, a 
triangle. that is  that symbol for in your notes? 
 
A: My symbol for change. 
 
Q: Change, the Delta sign? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And what is the word right before that Delta sign?  I am 
referring to the first page of your handwritten notes. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Are we on the first page of handwritten notes? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
THE WITNESS: Faye's. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I see.  I am looking at the third page of handwritten notes, and I 
can't read all the writing there.  Why don't you take a look at the 
original.  There is a reference to $5,000 and 60 hours and so forth.  
Can you read that to me. 
 
A: The first line says dollar sign. 
 
Q: Dollars? 
 
A: "Dollars from O.J.  Worked 60 hours on Playboy info.  Made up 
Gizmo." 
 
Q: "Gizmo," what is the Gizmo? 
 
A: The Gizmo is the little workout exercise banner. 
 
Q: You made that? 
 
A: Was paid $5,000 for -- which calculates out to about $83 an 
hour. 
 
Q: What does the rest of that say? 
 
A: Much less than in office. 
 
Q: What does that mean? 
 
A: It means that I made in that particular instance less dollars than 
I would working in the office. 
 
Q: You are trying to show that you are not profiting from O.J. 
Simpson; right? 
 
A: This was -- I wrote this page as a result of an interview that Faye 
did relatively recently. 
 
A: Down at the very bottom there is a reference to children, what 
does that say? 
 
A: Children, they love him, they jump on dad and hug him.  That is 
in reference to how his children are behaving to him at this time. 
 
Q: At this time? 
 
A: Right.  Recently. 
 
Q: Since he has been out of jail? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: When did you write this page right here? 
 
A: This was probably about a month ago, two months ago. 
 
Q: Let me ask you a question. These typewritten pages, when were 
they written? 
 
A: Those were written through '95. 
 
Q: And going to the first -- 
 
A: These, I would say, probably December of '94 through 
September. 
 
Q: Of? 
 
A: Of '95. 
 
Q: What is? 
 
A: The typed notes. 
 
Q: The typed notes.  Now go to the handwritten notes. 
 
A: The handwritten notes would be after that. 
 
Q: Starting when and going to when? 
 
A: From the middle of last year until a month ago, two months 
ago, something like that. 
 
Q: Have you told O.J. Simpson about this contemplated book? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, you have a statement on the top of one of these pages that 
says, amazing how many people did not come forward in order not 
to -- it looks like become involved or be involved.  Do you see that 
right here (indicating)? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Who are those people? 
 
A: Well --  
 
Q: Name them. 
 
A: I think Ron Fischman, I think Cora.  You know, there are a 
number of people that have not gone as public as a lot of other 
people have. 
 
Q: Are you actually saying, then, that the number of people who 
have not come forward is amazing, indicating a staggering number. 
 
A: I think that a lot --  
 
Q: Who are those people besides Cora and Ron. 
 
A: I think -- 
 
Q: Cora was on The Barbara Walters Show so she did come 
forward; right? 
 
A: Yes.  But, you know, there is a way of coming forward and 
there is a way of coming forward. 
 
Q: Do you think Cora has more to say, you mean? 
 
A: I don't know what she said in the deposition with you, but I 
know that she has not stepped in the media saying -- 
 
Q: Is it fair to say that you are referring to people who should come 
forward on behalf of O.J. Simpson to speak out in his defense; is 
that a fair statement? 
 
A: No.  This has nothing to do with O.J.  Simpson.  It has to do 
with, I think, people are scared about the process. 
 
Q: Well, when you say it does not have to do about O.J. Simpson, 
you are talking about people coming forward to talk about their 
knowledge of this case; right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And Cora is one of them; right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what do you understand Cora Fischman to know that is so 
important about this case? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection.  Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I think that, you know, her belief of what 
happened.  She hasn't fully --She hasn't gone into the media and 
exploited it. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: What do you understand her belief of what happened to be? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: That O.J. is innocent. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And did she explain why O.J. is innocent to you? 
 
A: No. But she explained to me that that is what she believed. 
 
Q: And what about -- By the way, have you spoken to her since her 
deposition was taken? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you talked to her about whether she still has that belief 
now? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What about Ron Fischman? 
 
A: I haven't talked to him in probably a couple of years, a year-
and-a-half or whatever. 
 
Q: What would Ron Fischman have to say had he come forward? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Lack of foundation, speculation. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: To your knowledge. 
 
A: His understanding of O.J. and Nicole's relationship. 
 
Q: What did he understand to your knowledge? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Same objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: That they were having a really difficult time 
before the murders, that they were really working hard to try to 
figure things out but it didn't work. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And do you have an understanding whether Ron Fischman 
believes that Mr. Simpson is innocent? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Guilty? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Who else did not come forward who knows about the facts of 
this case? 
 
A: I don't know whether they know about the facts of the case, but, 
you know, I think some people have opted to not be vocal about it, 
about what their knowledge is. 
 
Q: Who are they? 
 
A: [Name Deleted], for example. 
 
Q: What does [Name Deleted] know to your knowledge? 
 
A: I am not sure what he knows, but I just  know that there was an 
absence -- 
 
Q: Do you know what his opinion is on Mr. Simpson's guilt? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Anyone else besides [Name Deleted], Cora Fischman, and Ron 
Fischman? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You say in here, "One friend is dead, the other in jail, accused.  
I only have interest in finding out what really happened, the truth 
will set one self free." But, in fact, you have done nothing to find 
out what really happened; true? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: That's right. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: True? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You don't really have a genuine interest in finding out what 
really happened; right? 
 
A: Wrong. 
 
Q: You have had plenty of opportunity, perhaps more than anyone, 
to ask O.J. Simpson what really happened and you never did; 
right? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: But it is not my job see.  It is not my job in my 
life to find out what happened on that particular end of the case, 
although I have a tremendous interest in finding out, but I am not 
going to -- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I didn't say it was your job.  No one is suggesting that it is your 
job.  But even though you have a tremendous interest in finding 
out what really happened and even though you have had a 
tremendous opportunity to find out by asking Mr. Simpson, you 
have not done so; is that right? 
 
A: That's right. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
A: If Mr. Simpson told you that he killed Ron and Nicole, would 
you still be his friend? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: I can't answer that question with a yes or no. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Why not? Suppose he said, "I did it.  You really want to know 
what happened, I did it."  Would you still be his friend? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: Give me a few days' time to think about the 
answer. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You would have to think about it for a few days? 
 
A: I think -- 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: I think it is an extremely difficult question to answer. 
 
Q: And you would have to think about it for a few days before you 
could decide whether to be his friend or not; true? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: I guess if you give me five days' time, I will give 
you an answer. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Two days and now five days.  How many days would you 
need? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: Let's not get into the argument about time.  It's 
ridiculous. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I just want an answer to my question. 
 
A: I cannot give you an answer. 
 
Q: You need a couple of days to find out whether you would still 
be his friend or not? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: I couldn't give you an answer other than I would 
need time to find it out, yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Now, the third page from the end appears, Mr. Reichardt, to be 
a chronology.  Why don't you read this to me so that I do not miss 
anything on this starting with June 8.  You have your handwritten 
m account of events from June 8, it looks like, to June 12; right? 
 
A: No.  Actually fall of '90 through 11-29. 
 
Q: Is that part of the same chronology? 
 
A: That's right. 
 
Q: Okay.  I see.  The last page -- this is obviously out of order -- 
starts the chronology; right? 
 
A: It starts with Fall '90 at the top of the page. 
 
Q: Why don't you read that starting with that page. 
 
A: "Fall '90 met Faye.

A: Faye. 
 
Q: Now, you wrote all of these notes long after the events in 
question; right? 
 
A: Right 
 
Q: Looking back? 
 
A: (Witness nods head.) 
 
Q: And what materials, if any, did you use to reconstruct these 
events, the dates, the times? 
 
A: The Day-Timers. 
 
Q: And if the information does not appear in the Day-Timer, it was 
from your memory? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: For example, what O.J. Simpson said to you on the evening of 
June 12 and your description of his demeanor and so forth, that is 
not in your Day-Timer; right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: In fact, nothing is in your Day-Timer of any substance 
concerning these comments in your notes; right? 
 
A: From that particular day? 
 
Q: From any of these events. 
 
A: Just times of travel arrangements. 
 
Q: Not what was said, who said what, who was there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: None of that. That was all from your memory; right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And when did you prepare this chronology? 
 
A: Probably in the earlier part of last year. 
 
Q: Did you do it at one sitting? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How long did it take? 
 
A: A couple of hours. 
 
Q: Why did you do it? 
 
A: To keep in my -- To get clarity in my mind as to what the 
sequence of events were and how things progressed. 
 
Q: Was this in anticipation of testifying at the criminal trial? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was it after you testified? 
 
A: I think it was done before, but it was not in anticipation for that. 
 
Q: But before you testified? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And did you discuss -- Did you do this alone? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you discuss it with anyone? 
 
A: No.  Actually, I think I mentioned it to you that I was doing it at 
some time. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: You may have. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Could you go to the one page that has at the top -- I can't read 
the heading.  What is that (indicating)? 
 
A: "Accusations." 
 
Q: "Accusations" to what? 
 
A: "CHR," me. 
 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: "CHR." 
 
Q: That's you.  Accusations to you? 
 
A: To Chris, yes. 
 
 
Q: Now, on the second side of that page, on the back side of it, 
could you read starting in the middle of the page.  
 
A: Yes.  "Some people new cars, houses, it's their new job pays 
well.  They want to continue it.  For example, Faye, Denise.  Faye 
on Geraldo talking about O.J.'s next moves.  Kim Goldman into 
deposition.  She is not a plaintiff no reason to be there." 
 
Q: Let me stop you right there.  What is this reference concerning 
Kim Goldman? 
 
A: Just one day I was sitting at the television and I saw Kim 
Goldman on the television -- 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: -- being very vocal. 
 
Q: About what? 
 
A: About why she was not in the deposition. 
 
Q: And that troubled you? 
 
A: Well, no, it didn't trouble me, but it makes me wonder why 
people do the things they do. 
 
Q: Why she would want to attend the deposition -- 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: -- of the man she believes murdered her brother? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: You think that is something that you cannot understand? 
 
A: I don't know whether she is a plaintiff in the case or not. 
 
Q: Does that make a difference to you? 
 
A: Yes.  If somebody is not a plaintiff in the case, they should not 
be at a deposition. 
 
Q: What is this thing about Faye's talking about O.J. Simpson's 
next moves?  What is that in reference to? 
 
A: That is just one thing that I switched channels and it was Faye 
on, that she knows what O.J.'s next moves were. 
 
Q: What were they? 
 
A: How did she know?  I didn't know. 
 
Q: But you wrote that down.  What was your purpose in writing 
this down, this business about Kim Goldman and Faye's talking on 
the Geraldo show? 
 
A: It is my observation of what people do and why people do it. 
 
Q: What is your point for writing it on paper, is this for use in your 
book -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -on this ethics issue? 
 
A: No.  This is my thought processing and remembering -- trying to 
remember, giving me impetus as to why people do things. 
 
Q: Why do you care about that to the point where you would write 
that down.  What is your fascination with all of this? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: No fascination. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Why would you sit there with a piece of paper and write down 
that Kim Goldman wants to attend the deposition of O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: No fascination.  Just thoughts. 
 
Q: This has nothing to do with possible use later on down the road 
with your book? 
 
A: No.  This one didn't. 
 
Q: Do you take notes and then share them with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Strategize -- 
 
A: No 
 
Q: -- as team members? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: What is the last paragraph? 
 
A: "Media screw ups -- change of info continues post verdict.  
Three jurors upset.  How one shows that they now would give 
different verdict.  On Larry King they complained it's a lie." 
 
Q: "They complained it's a lie"? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When did you make these notes on this page? 
 
A: I guess this was -- The front part of this was I think Faye doing 
one television show, I don't know which one it was, but those were 
the things that she was talking about, so I guess this must have 
been at the same time, whichever one it was.  Recently when she 
was doing a slew of different shows. 
 
Q: Is this a running commentary that you are keeping on these 
pages? 
 
A: No. I haven't done anything with it anymore since then. 
 
Q: Now, at the top of that page could you read that. 
 
A: "Good about case.  It brought some issues forward.  Physical 
abuse, some race problems, some rogue cops, DA can be 
challenged, truth persists." 
 
Q: Could you go to the prior page and could  you read the last 
section there. 
 
A: The front of that? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: "Questions, 1, about abuse.  I condone not abnormal violence, 
mental, emotional, or physical.  O.J. and Nicole not only people 
getting physical -- especially" -- I can't read my own handwriting 
there, the last word.  "Faye described abuse situation's not true.  I 
have total different view." 
 
Q: Stop right there.  How did O.J. Simpson and Nicole get 
physical? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: To your knowledge. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: To my knowledge that one incident, that I have 
seen pictures of but that's it. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And did you talk to O.J. Simpson about  that at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You never once asked him if he struck Nicole or hit Nicole or 
what happened? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And he has never volunteered that to you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So you have had no conversations whatsoever about his history 
of abuse or his abuse of Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So you don't know what happened; right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: So what is your totally different view on this? 
 
A: No.  Faye described abuse situation's not true.  I have totally 
different view on what Faye describes. 
 
Q: You are not talking about situations where O.J. Simpson struck 
Nicole; right? 
 
A: No.  I am talking about the situations that Faye describes in her 
book. 
 
Q: You mean the restaurant -- 
 
A: The restaurant. 
 
Q: -- incidents that you were present at? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Can you read on. 
 
A: "2, O.J. making money.  You don't want him to make money, 
only if you think he is guilty," which is ignorant, I think.  The 
people that screamed loudest are the ones that made the most 
money on it." 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: "3, children."  I think we did that earlier.  "They love him.  
Jump on Dad.  Hug him." 
 
Q: Okay.  Now, could you go up to the top where it says 
"Accusations to 
Christian Reichardt, drugs, stopped 1981." What is the next line? 
 
A: Chris and Faye write book together -- bullshit.  Darden in court 
said himself I asked Faye and me not to speak.  Obviously I'm not 
in the media at this time." 
 
Q: And who made an accusation that you were going to write a 
book with Faye Resnick? 
 
A: Faye. 
 
Q: And that was not true from your perspective; right? 
 
A: Not only from my perspective. 
 
Q: But from hers too? 
 
A: She knows that that's a lie. 
 
Q: Did she tell you? 
 
A: No.  She knows. 
 
Q: Have you spoken to Faye Resnick recently? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When was the last time? 
 
A: That I spoke to her it was probably in December of '94 when I 
asked her to not ever contact me again. 
 
Q: Have you read her deposition? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What I am going to do at this time is defer to 
one of the other lawyers because I want to read some notes that I 
have, but otherwise I am through. 
 
EXAMINATION BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q: Mr. Reichardt, I just have a few questions over the next few 
minutes.  I want to focus your attention for a moment on the June 
12th phone call. 
 
Was it your understanding in talking with Mr. Simpson that he was 
packing at the time that you were having this phone call? 
 
A: That's right. 
 
Q: And when you say that he was packing, that he was physically 
packing as he was speaking to you on the phone? 
 
A: I don't know that.  It might have been in the sense of I am 
getting my things together.  Whether he is actually packing or 
moving around the house to get the things together, I don't know. 
 
Q: Well, could you hear him doing things as you were on the 
telephone with him that led you believe that he was putting things 
in suitcases or moving things around in an effort to pack at the 
time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You indicated when you had this telephone conversation with 
Mr. Simpson the television was on; isn't that correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Based upon your ability to heard the television over the 
telephone could you tell what volume it was at? 
 
A: It was in the background. 
 
Q: Could you tell what room Mr. Simpson was in at the time that 
he was talking with you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he tell you what room he was in? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was there anything about what you heard that enabled you to 
discern what room he was in at the time that you had the telephone 
conversation with him. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And at some point, as you testified to, he asked somebody the 
score of the game; is that correct? 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: Right. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q: And I think the way you described it was as though he said over 
his shoulder, "What's the score," something of that nature? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: He did not yell it out, did he? 
 
A: No 
 
 
Q: So as you described it, it was a normal -- the pitch of his voice 
and the volume of his voice was normal conversation as though -- 
 
A: Well, I think it was more like he did not yell it out to somebody, 
but as he was speaking on the phone and you talk to somebody, 
and somebody catches you and you are speaking a little louder to 
somebody, and then he came back. 
 
Q: It did not appear to you as though he was yelling out the front 
door -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- or out the window asking somebody the score; is that correct? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.   
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q: Based upon the manner in which he asked that question, it was 
clear to you that that person was in the same room with Mr. 
Simpson -- 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Lack of foundation. 
 
MR.BREWER: Wait a second.  You can make your objection but 
let me finish my question. 
 
Do we have the question completed on the record? 
 
(The record was read as follows: 
 
Q: Based upon the manner in which he asked that question, it was 
clear to you that that person was in the same room with Mr. 
Simpson --") 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q: Is that true? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: It appeared to me like that. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q: And your answer is yes? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you not hear anyone say anything in response to that 
question that was asked by Mr. Simpson; is that true? 
 
A: That's true. 
 
Q: Was there a period of time after he asked the question where 
there was some silence where you could hear them had they said 
something? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q: In other words -- Strike the question.  He asked the question of 
somebody about the score; right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection.  Lack of foundation. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q: Was there a pause in his voice in order to allow --  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- whoever he asked the question to to respond? 
 
A: Right.  Yes. 
 
Q: Did you hear anyone say anything? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Were you able to still hear the television at the time? 
 
A: Yes.  But it was making, like, background noise. 
 
Q: Were you able to discern that there was a game on? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you say "background noise," what do you mean? 
 
A: You hear that there is something going on in the background 
televisionwise, but you cannot differentiate what it is. 
 
Q: Were you able to hear a voice announcing something or 
describing something? 
 
A: I didn't pay attention to that. 
 
Q: When you say "background noise," did you hear voices talking, 
gun shooting, cars crashing?  What exactly --. 
 
A: It was voices talking. 
 
Q: Could you tell whether it was a male voice or a female voice 
that you heard? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: And was the television on, as far as you knew, the whole time 
that you were talking with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And was it relatively close in the beginning of the conversation 
that he asked this person the score? 
 
A: No. It was later on. 
 
Q: This was about an eight-minute conversation? 
 
A: Yes, eight. 
 
Q: Was it about halfway through the conversation? 
 
A: Well, halfway or later.  Because at first we talked about, you 
know, Paula and going on this trip later, towards the end of the 
conversation. 
 
Q: So there was a conversation about Paula first? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then what was the next subject matter? 
 
A: That he is packing his bag. 
 
Q: He told you he was packing his bag? 
 
A: Right.  But not word for word, "I am packing my bag."  It was 
like "I'm getting my things together.  I'm going to Chicago." 
 
Q: Did he tell you whether he had been packing earlier? 
 
A: No.  I don't recall. 
 
Q: Did he say anything about that he was finishing packing? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: He just said to you that he was packing? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did he tell you that he was going to be back in town on 
Wednesday? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: So it was your understanding based upon what Mr. Simpson 
told you at that time that he was not scheduled to return from 
Chicago until Wednesday? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Are you certain of that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you ask him what he was going to do in Chicago for 
three days? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he volunteer that information? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he indicate he was going to play golf? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he indicate where he was staying? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So you had no idea other than the fact that he was leaving for 
Chicago why he was going there? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did you know whether it was a business trip or leisure trip? 
 
A: I assumed it was a business trip, but he didn't say anything. 
 
Q: Why did you assume that it was a business trip? 
 
A: Because he goes out of town a lot on business. 
 
Q: Have you ever been with Mr. Simpson when he has left on 
business from his house? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever traveled with him on vacations or otherwise 
leaving from his house? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you have any familiarity with his habits in terms of ordering 
limousine services or  utilizing limousine services when he travels? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was it your impression, based upon what Mr. Simpson told 
you, that he was leisurely packing? 
 
A: Yes.  You know, getting this together. 
 
Q: But was it your sense that he was doing this in a leisurely way? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR.LEONARD: Objection.  Asking for speculation. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q: And did he say something to you that led you to that 
conclusion? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: That was just an inference that you drew as a result of your 
conversation? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did he tell you that he had to do anything else that evening to 
get ready to go to Chicago? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he tell you whether he was going to go have something to 
eat? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he tell you whether he had already eaten? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Mr. Simpson mention to you that Mr. Kaelin was at home? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you met Mr. Kaelin on previous occasions? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Have you spoken with him? 
 
A: Briefly. 
 
Q: You were familiar with his voice? 
 
A: That's a tough question. 
 
Q: As of June 12, 1994, if Kato Kaelin picked up the telephone and 
you had a conversation with him, would you be able to recognize 
that it is Kato Kaelin's voice? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: If you had overheard Kato Kaelin say something to Mr. 
Simpson on the telephone, you would have been able to recognize 
that person as Kato Kaelin; is that correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did Mr. Simpson say that anyone else was at home that 
evening? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Would you say that in the weeks and months before Nicole's 
death O.J. Simpson was depressed? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Not at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You never described Mr. Simpson to anyone as being 
depressed? 
 
A: I think everybody was going through so many different moods, 
you know, there might have been a day of being depressed, there 
might have been days of not being depressed, not happy, upset. 
 
Q: Just so that you are clear, I really don't care about anyone else 
other than O.J. Simpson for the purpose of my question. 
 
My question is: Is it fair to say that you have described on previous 
occasions O.J. Simpson being depressed in the weeks and months 
before Nicole Brown Simpson's death? 
 
A: I don't recall.  It is possible, yes. 
 
Q: You are saying that it is possible that you described -- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And that is because he was depressed; isn't that true? 
 
A: At times, yes. 
 
Q: And at times he was upset; isn't that true? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when you say he was upset, he was agitated in the weeks 
and months before her death; isn't that true? 
 
A: At times, yes. 
 
Q: Did you ever talk to O.J. Simpson about his seeking some kind 
of counseling or assistance in order to help deal with his agitation 
and depression? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he ever suggest that he was thinking about that with you? 
 
A: I think we talked about it at some point, that he had thought 
about that that might be a good idea. 
 
Q: To go talk to someone? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And did you tell him that you thought that that might be a good 
idea? 
 
A: I think it is a good idea for anybody. 
 
Q: Sure.  If somebody is depressed and upset over a relationship to 
go talk to a professional, that would be a good idea; right? 
 
A: Yes. Somebody who is happy who is not depressed, it is a good 
idea. 
 
Q: But you were not talking with Mr. Simpson in the context of his 
telling you that he was happy and thinking about seeing a 
counselor; right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: You were talking with Mr. Simpson wherein he was describing 
to you being depressed and upset in the weeks and months before 
Nicole's death; true? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Misstates testimony. 
 
THE WITNESS: Can you rephrase it or can you repeat it? 
 
MR. BREWER: Sure. 
 
Q: In the context of this discussion that you had with Mr. Simpson 
wherein he indicated to you that he was thinking about seeking 
some professional assistance, that discussion occurred while Mr. 
Simpson was telling you about depression and being upset with 
Nicole; right? 
 
A: But I also mentioned that it would be a good idea for me as well 
or anybody who is going through a difficult time.  It wasn't a 
discussion.  It was more like a comment. 
 
Q: A comment that you made? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You were telling Mr.Simpson that it is a good idea to get 
professional help for anyone? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Point being, though, when Mr. Simpson and you were talking 
about this, he was telling you that he was upset and depressed; 
right? 
 
A: No.  It was more about it was a difficult time, so I think it 
would be a good idea to go see somebody, and I said yes. 
 
Q: Did he tell you who he was going to go see? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he tell you whether he ever followed through and actually 
saw someone? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When was this discussion that you had with Mr. Simpson about 
his seeking some professional assistance? 
 
A: It was probably even before the Cabo trip. 
 
Q: Before the Cabo trip -- 
 
A: Right around that time. 
 
Q: Which Cabo trip, the May or -- 
 
A: The April one. 
 
Q: Was it a telephone conversation? 
 
A: I think we were sitting at dinner.  Faye and Nicole had gone to 
the rest room, and that is when we briefly talked, had a couple 
minutes' time. 
 
Q: So while they were gone, you and Mr. Simpson had a 
discussion where the idea of some professional counseling came 
up; is that true? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did he bring it up to you? 
 
A: I don't recall who started it. 
 
Q: At the time of dinner, did he tell you or in this discussion did he 
tell you whether he had done any investigation into the names of 
any individuals that he was thinking about seeing? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you talked to Mr. Simpson about any of his analysis with 
respect to witnesses that have testified in the civil case? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You haven't talked to him about his analysis of Mr. Kaelin's 
deposition? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You have not talked to him about his analysis with respect to 
Paula Barbieri's deposition? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You have not talked to him about Cora Fischman's deposition? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Has he ever taken you around the property in an effort to go 
through some analysis with respect to some of the physical 
evidence? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Pointing out where things were found? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know, for example, as you sit here today why blood 
drops were found on his property? 
 
A: I have from pictures and photographs that I have seen, but no. 
 
Q: You have seen photographs? 
 
A: Yes.  Whatever pops up on television sometimes. 
 
Q: Has Mr. Simpson ever said anything about the location of those 
blood drops found on his property? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: No discussion at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: No discussions at all relative to the glove, where it was found? 
 
A: No.  I don't think so. 
 
Q: Or the fact that there was no blood around the glove where, 
according to you, one would have suspected that there would have 
been blood? 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: Was there any discussion with respect to the production of the 
1-800 videotape? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And you only looked at part of it? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you have your own copy? 
 
A: I have my own copy.  It is still unopened. 
 
Q: And it was given to you by Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did he suggest that you take a look at it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ask for a copy? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he volunteer it? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: For free; right? 
 
A: (No audible response.) 
 
Q: Did he give you more than one copy? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you care who wins this lawsuit? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q: Do you want Mr. Simpson to prevail in this case? 
 
A: It is not up to me to decide on who should or who will. 
 
Q: Well, the jury will ultimately decide but I am asking for your 
own personal belief. 
 
A: It is not my decision. 
 
Q: So you have no personal view whatsoever with respect to the 
outcome of this case? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Do you think it is unfair that Mr. Simpson is undergoing a 
second process where he is being tried? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q: No thoughts whatsoever on that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever talked to Mr. Simpson about whether he thinks it 
is unfair? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Whether he thinks it is unconstitutional in some way? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Could you tell whether Mr. Simpson, going back to the June 
12th conversation, was on a hand-held telephone versus a regular 
phone? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q: You did not hear any static? 
 
A: No.  It sounded like a really clear connection. 
 
Q: Does he have a television in his bedroom? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And he has one in the den -- right? -- the TV room downstairs? 
 
A: Downstairs in the living room, yes. 
 
Q: And you have heard both televisions? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You have watched TV in both rooms? 
 
A: That's right. 
 
Q: Were you able to discern based upon the television that you 
heard in the background which television was on as you were 
having this telephone conversation with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. BREWER: I don't have anything further. 
 
MS. ROIT: I just have a couple of questions. 
 
EXAMINATION BY MS. ROIT: 
 
Q: I want to go back to Wednesday night when you went over to 
Mr. Simpson's house and you spoke with Mr. Leonard.  Do you 
recall that testimony? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. LEONARD: No.  I don't think -- I think that misstates 
testimony. 
 
THE WITNESS: Right.  t was a phone call. 
 
MS. ROIT: I understand. 
 
Q: You were going over to Mr. Simpson's house but you spoke to 
Mr. Leonard.  That is what I meant. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did Mr. Simpson know you were coming that night? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: He did not know you were coming? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You just dropped by? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: You had no conversations with Mr. Simpson prior to going over 
that night that you were coming over? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Is that a frequent occurrence, that you would drop by his house 
without telling him that you were coming over? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: How long was your telephone conversation with Mr. Leonard? 
 
A: A few minutes. 
 
Q: And after you were done with whatever conversation you had 
with Mr. Leonard, did you hand the phone back over to Mr. 
Simpson? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did you overhear anything else Mr. Simpson said to Mr. 
Leonard subsequent to that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did they continue speaking on the phone? 
 
A: I believe so.  I walked out of the room. 
 
Q: When was the last time prior to that night that you went over to 
Mr. Simpson's house? 
 
A: Probably two weeks ago, three weeks earlier. 
 
Q: And your deposition was scheduled for Friday morning 
following that Wednesday night; correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Is it your testimony here that going over to Mr. Simpson's on 
Wednesday night with your deposition scheduled for Friday 
morning was a complete coincidence? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Just a couple of questions about the June 12th phone call. You 
indicated that you were watching a movie on cable; correct? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: What cable company are you with? 
 
A: Century Cable. 
 
Q: And you do not recall which cable channel it was? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you recall whether it was one it was one of the movie 
channels like HBO or Cinemax, the ones you have to pay a little 
extra for? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: Do you remember anything about the movie you were 
watching? 
 
A: It was some -- I believe it was a war movie. 
 
Q: I recall your mentioning it was a war movie.  Was it a black and 
white?  Was it a color movie? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: You do not recall that? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Do you recall what war? 
 
A: No.  I just remember looking back it was some type of shooting 
up type of movie. 
 
Q: Was it one of the World Wars? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Do you recall which scene you were watching before Mr. 
Simpson phoned you? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Do you remember if the movie was at the beginning or middle 
or at the end? 
 
A: I think it was in the middle. 
 
Q: Do you remember which scene you were watching when you 
went back to seeing it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So would it be correct to say that you recall nothing about that 
movie other than that it was some war movie that you were 
watching? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And when you learned of the murders and you went back in 
your head, I assume, to reconstruct the events of June 12th, you 
recalled clearly the time of the phone call and the phone call; right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did you try to reconstruct what you were watching at the time? 
 
A: You know, I thought about it. 
 
Q: You did? 
 
A: Yeah.  I thought about it, and I couldn't figure out what I was 
watching.  I just remember that it was some relatively violent kind 
of thing. 
 
Q: Did you jot any notes down other than what you have produced 
at any time about the content of your conversation with Mr. 
Simpson on June 12th? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You have indicated that you treated Mr. Simpson for free; 
right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was Mr. Simpson a source of client referrals for your business? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he ever refer any clients to you? 
 
A: No. 
 
MS. ROIT: I don't have any other questions. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I have some more questions. 
 
EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You were born where, Mr. Reichardt? 
 
A: In Germany. 
 
Q: In what year? 
 
A: '59. 
 
Q: When did you come to the United States? 
 
A: In '78. 
 
Q: So from 1959 to 1978 you lived in Germany? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Did you ever spend anytime with Paula Barbieri, let's say, after 
your birthday party on April 30, 1994 until Nicole's death? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You never saw her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q You never spoke to her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: It is a fair statement, is it not, that you had asked O.J. Simpson 
to make referrals to you of celebrities and athletes? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: This is before Nicole's death. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: That is not a fair statement? 
 
A: That is not a fair statement. 
 
Q: That is not true? 
 
A: That's not true. 
 
Q: Did O.J. Simpson tell you that he had once used cocaine? 
 
A: Years ago. 
 
Q: What did he say to you? 
 
A: That years, in years past, the days when he was playing ball that 
he had used it sometimes. 
 
Q: And you seem to really emphasize how long ago that was.  Why 
is that? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: Because I remember -- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You don't have any interest, it could be yesterday for all you 
care? 
 
A: No.  Because we -- 
 
Q: You are not trying to protect him, are you? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: I remember we talked about how athletes get 
injured. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And he told you that he had used cocaine; true? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And he told you that he had used pills also; correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And he told you that he had been addicted to drugs at one point 
in his life; right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: He never told you that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When was the last time, to your knowledge, that he used 
cocaine? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Lack of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: As far as I knew it from that conversation, it was 
in the days when he was playing ball. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And who else was present during that conversation? 
 
A: I think it was him and I in a treatment room.  Nobody else. 
 
Q: When did he tell you that? 
 
A: One of the visits that he came to my office. 
 
Q: In 1994? 
 
A: Or '93. '94. One of the visits that he came. 
 
Q: You said they started in late 1993 so -- 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: -- this conversation occurred in late 1993 or into '94; right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: You saw a draft of Faye Resnick's book before it was 
published?  I am talking about Private Diary.  Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You never saw it before -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she discuss it with you? 
 
A: She discussed it -- In the days before the release of the book, she 
gave me a copy of the book. 
 
Q: That's what I mean, before the release of the book. 
 
A: But it wasn't a draft. 
 
Q: Okay.  It wasn't a draft. 
 
A: It was a finished print --  
 
Q: But you read it before it was released; right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you told her not to release it;  right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You told her that you had objections to it; right? 
 
A: I told her that there are a number of things in there that I know 
not to be the truth. 
 
Q: And you told her to take them out; right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Isn't it true that you told her that there were things that she was 
saying about O.J. Simpson that were untrue? 
 
A: I told her that there were things in the whole book that are not 
true. 
 
Q: Specifically about O.J. Simpson that portrayed him in a bad 
light; right? 
 
A: No. No. 
 
Q: What were the things that you told her were untrue? 
 
A: The way she was portraying the -- particularly the two incidents 
at the sushi bar and -- 
 
Q: And Toscana? 
 
A: And Toscana. 
 
Q: And in both of those portrayals you thought her portrayal of 
O.J. Simpson was false; right? 
 
A: Right.  Not just of O.J. Simpson but the whole group.  She 
described the whole group acting in a certain way that was not 
correct. 
 
Q: But the gist of her portrayals of O.J. Simpson was that he went 
into a rage; right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you thought that was false; right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you thought that O.J. Simpson did not go into a rage; 
right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: What else was untrue? 
 
A: I don't know any specifics right now.  I do not remember any 
specifics right now, but the whole gist of the book was very 
strange.  There were incidents, for example, where she describes 
the second Cabo trip and forgets that I was in there, that I was at 
the trip, things like that. 
 
Q: You cannot recall any other specifics? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Didn't you tell Ms. Resnick that you also have a story to tell 
about abused men? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And about how you were abused by her and Nicole was abused 
by O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You never said that? 
 
A: No. 
 
A: Didn't O.J. Simpson call you from jail several times and leave 
you messages? 
 
A: Yes, probably. 
 
Q: And wasn't he asking you in those messages to help clear his 
name and find out information for him.' 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Wasn't he asking you to set the record straight as far as Faye 
Resnick was concerned? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And to go public and refute Faye's story? 
 
A: He had asked me on one occasion that if I found something 
wrong in Faye's first book, whether I would comment. 
 
Q: You mean to say that if you find something wrong rather than 
you know something's wrong? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Why would he say "if" if you and he knew for a fact that Faye's 
statements were untrue? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: I think that it is not a matter of him convincing 
me what I have to do, it is just... 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Didn't he say to you to go convince people that her book is a 
pack of lies? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know who Arthur Barrons is? 
 
A: I sure do. 
 
Q: Who is he? 
 
A: He is Faye's attorney. 
 
Q: Did you ever have any conversations with him about a book 
deal? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever have any conversations at all with him? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: About what? 
 
A: About a personal injury case that I treated Faye for. 
 
Q: When was that? 
 
A: I think it was in '93, '92. 
 
Q: But you never spoke to him about a suggestion concerning you 
and Faye Resnick co-authoring the book? 
 
A: Absolutely not. 
 
Q: Did you ever hear that Faye Resnick had met with the stars 
Tony Frost? 
 
A: I found that out later, yes. 
 
Q: And when you found out, did you get upset? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Was Ms. Resnick present when you were upset? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: And did you pound holes in the wall and throw perfume bottles 
at her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you do anything violent at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Why were you upset? 
 
A: I was upset because in the days after -- when Faye was still at 
the rehab center we had agreed to stay out of the media because we 
both knew that this was going to be a media crazy thing, and the 
first opportunity she had, I believe, was a few days after she came 
out of the day care at Exodus, as I found out later.  She told me that 
she had gone to have coffee with a friend at 10 o'clock at night, 
and, then Kris Jenner a couple of days later told me that  she had 
actually met with someone from the Star instead of this friend. 
 
Q: And that upset you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You did not want her going to the media; right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: You were concerned about her own protection and safety; right? 
 
A: Also. 
 
Q: In addition to what? 
 
A: Not getting herself involved with something that is not her 
place to get involved with. 
 
Q Didn't you also tell her not to go to the prosecution? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Didn't you tell her to stay away from the prosecutors? 
 
A: No.  The only discussion we had was about the media. 
 
Q: And you didn't go to the prosecutors either, did you? 
 
A: A week-and-a-half after the murders the prosecutors came to 
see me. 
 
Q: But before they came to see you, you didn't go see them, right? 
 
A: This was like two days after the murders the detectives called 
me up and we scheduled an appointment for a week-and-a-half 
after. 
 
Q: Two days?  On what day did they call you? 
 
A: A few days.  A couple of days after the murder.  I remember 
between the two detectives and I we were trying to figure out a 
mutual convenient time. 
 
Q: Did you ever discuss the account of the conversation with O.J. 
Simpson on June 12 that appears in your notes, that account with 
anyone else prior to today and prior to Friday, of course? 
 
A: I think I mentioned it to Bill Pavelick.  I believe I talked to 
Johnnie Cochran about it. 
 
Q And before you wrote that account of the conversation down in 
your notes, or thereabouts during that period of time, did you call 
O.J. Simpson to go over it with him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ask him what his recollection was? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever asked him what his recollection of that 
conversation was? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: His lawyer Johnnie Cochran told you what Mr. Simpson's 
recollection was; right? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: Right. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: He discussed that with you, didn't he? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Mr. Pavelick did; right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So you are saying that to this day you do not know what Mr. 
Simpson's recollection of that conversation was? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: You do not know what his account of it was? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Not even in general terms? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And you do not know if it is completely inconsistent with or 
totally consistent with yours? 
 
A: I have no idea. 
 
Q: Is it just a coincidence that both you and he give almost 
verbatim accounts word by word of that conversation? 
 
A: I have no -- 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: I have no idea.  I don't know whether it is a 
coincidence or not. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Now, you said Mr. Simpson called the house after the Cabo trip 
in April of '94 numerous times to speak to Faye; correct? 
 
A: (Witness nods head.) 
 
Q: You have to answer audibly. 
 
A: I'm sorry.  My thought was wandering for a moment. 
 
Q: After the Cabo trip Mr. Simpson called the house numerous 
times to speak to Faye about Nicole; correct? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And he would call even in the wee hours of the morning from 
time to time; right? 
 
A: I think I would -- if I talked to him, it was usually after the 
office at night. 
 
Q: He sometimes called 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning and you 
would answer the phone and hand it to Faye; true? 
 
A: Not that I recall. 
 
Q: Not once? 
 
A: I don't recall that at all. 
 
Q: You recall that it did not occur or you just do not recall? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't recall that it ever occurred.  I don't answer 
the phone after 10:00.  I go to sleep. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: So if Faye got phone calls at 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning you 
would not know; right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: You would have no way of refuting her testimony on that; 
right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Do you have a collection of ceramic frogs? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Is it true that Nicole would not go near that? 
 
A: I have no idea. 
 
Q: Did she know about your ceramic frog collection? 
 
A: I don't know.  They are in my bathroom. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: You have frogs? 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: You never told me that. 
 
THE WITNESS: They are in my bathroom, so I assume if she went 
to the bathroom downstairs she must have been near them. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Do you recall an incident in Cabo San Lucas in April of 1994 
when you were driving with Mr. Simpson in a van together with 
Bruce Jenner, Nicole, Christian, Faye, and the children, the van 
was cut off by another car and Mr. Simpson said, "Can you 
imagine if we had just been killed by that car, they would think we 
were in a van like a bunch of Mexicans crammed in here.  And, 
Bruce, who do you think would get top billing, you or me?"  Do 
you recall that? 
 
A: No. Do they really say these things.   Sorry. 
 
Q: Did you almost get into a fight with Christopher Darden when 
you were interviewed by him? 
 
A: I don't think a fight, but he was not very polite. 
 
Q: Did you have an argument with him not on the record that was 
not being recorded by the stenographer? 
 
A: Yes. Yes.  I think I asked him to change his tone of voice, 
please. 
 
Q: And what did he say to you that offended you? 
 
A: It was not what he was saying, it was how he was saying it and 
how he was trying to -- just his voice inflections. 
 
Q: What bothered you about his voice inflections? 
 
A: He was very aggressive. 
 
Q: And so you were offended by that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was there an implication in your mind that you were not telling 
him everything that you knew? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You were not being truthful to him. 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Calls for speculation. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And that you were trying to help your good buddy O.J. 
Simpson? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: (Witness shakes head.) 
 
(Discussion was held between the witness and his counsel out of 
the hearing of the reporter.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Are you aware of any argument between Nicole and Faye in the 
last month or so of Nicole's life? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Didn't you overhear an argument between Nicole and Faye 
when Nicole called Faye about the fact that she was planning to 
attend the Sports Spectacular event on July 4 -- 
 
A: I wasn't -- 
 
Q: -- even though she had split up with O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: I was not present at that conversation, but I know they -- they 
were talking about that.  I don't know whether they had an 
argument, but I know that they didn't -- that Nicole didn't want us 
to go with O.J. to the Sports Spectacular. 
 
Q: Did Faye tell you that she had had an argument with Nicole 
about this? 
 
A: Faye told me that she talked to Nicole about it. 
 
Q: And that Nicole was very unhappy; right? 
 
A: Yes.  But I don't know whether it was an argument.  I wasn't 
present at the conversation. 
 
A: Wasn't it reported to you that Nicole said that O.J. Simpson was 
trying to buy her friends? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: Faye said that that had been an issue for Nicole, 
yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Including your taking $5,000 from O.J. Simpson; right? 
 
A: No.  That was something that Faye started bringing up later 
after the murders. 
 
Q: What was the reference to buying the friends that came up at the 
time? 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: Which time? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Before the murders. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Lack of foundation, calls for speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: That was when Nicole talked to Faye, as far as I 
understand it, where they were going -- Faye was talking to Nicole 
that we were going with O.J. to the Sports Spectacular and Nicole 
was unhappy that we did or that we wanted to. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Isn't it true that after the conversation between Faye and O.J. 
Simpson about this event, this Sports Spectacular event, that Mr. 
Simpson called you and asked you what was going on, and you 
told him that Faye and Nicole had just had a heated conversation; 
is that true? 
 
A: I don't recall that. 
 
Q: And then Faye came on the phone and told Mr. Simpson that 
Nicole was upset because she thought that he was taking her 
friends away from her? 
 
A: I know that O.J. and Faye had that one conversation about that, 
but I don't know whether Faye and Nicole -- I don't recall whether 
they had the conversation. 
 
Q: And you do not remember having that conversation with O.J. 
Simpson? 
 
A: No.  No, I don't recall that.  I have talked about so many things 
in that time. 
 
Q: Did you ever attend a dinner with O.J. Simpson, Nicole, and 
Faye Resnick where pills were taken away from Faye? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When was that? 
 
A: That was, I think probably 10 days or so before the Cabo trip. 
 
Q: And describe the pills that were taken. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Can we just know which Cabo trip. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The first Cabo trip. 
 
THE WITNESS: The first Cabo trip. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And what pills were taken away? 
 
A: I believe they were pain medications for -- that Faye was taking 
for her surgery. 
 
Q: Just days before; right? 
 
A: Right.  Or -- 
 
Q: You took those pills away from her? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Now, you previously have testified from time to time that Faye 
Resnick was high at certain points in time.  Describe to us how you 
could tell. 
 
A: I would come home and there are 15 or 20 cigarettes burning in 
different ashtrays all over the house, drawers are emptied out on 
the floor.  I would find her half unconscious in the bathtub almost 
drowning with her mouth hanging in the water.  I would find her 
unconscious in front of the bed.  Other times I would find her just 
running around very upset, frantic in the house. 
 
Q: It was very obvious? 
 
A: It was very obvious.  Not pretty. 
 
Q: Not able to conduct herself normally; right? 
 
A: Right.  Yes. 
 
Q: Not able to carry on normal conversations; right? 
 
A: Not normal conversations.  Conversations rather frantic . She 
carried on those at times.  You know, it varied.  It depends, I guess, 
on what types of things she was doing or taking at the time. 
 
Q: Was she able to conduct herself nonetheless even though she 
was high? 
 
A: At times, yes; at times, no.  Like I said, depending on, I assume, 
what she was taking.  There were times when she was -- 
 
Q: You had never seen her take these things, so you are just going 
on what she looked like; right? 
 
A: What she was conducting herself like.  Sometimes she would be 
just sluggish and other days she was frantic and other days she was 
unconscious so... 
 
Q: When she was high this way, did she make things up that didn't 
happen? 
 
A: Oh, absolutely. 
 
Q: And tell me everything you can remember that she fabricated 
when she was high? 
 
A: Supposedly I was having different affairs, constantly.  I was 
taking money away from her.  I was not giving her her freedom.  I 
was not buying her a car.  I was not getting married to her.  I was 
not liking her friends.  I was not -- like you name it, every day it 
was something different. 
 
Q: Can you remember anything else that she fabricated which she 
was high? 
 
A: No. I think that pretty much wraps it up. 
 
Q: Did she ever fabricate anything about O.J. Simpson when she 
was high? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: As you sit here now can you think of anything that she 
fabricated about O.J. Simpson -- 
 
MR. LEONARD: Objection.  Lack of -- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: -- while high? 
 
MR. LEONARD: foundation -- 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know whether she was high when she 
wrote the book.  I know she was under the influence at those 
dinners. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I am saying something that you know for a fact that she made 
up invented, it didn't happen, when she was high? 
 
A: Not that I know of, no. 
 
MR.PETROCELLI: Okay.  I don't have anything further. 
 
MR. LEONARD: No questions. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I didn't think so. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: You are done.  Does that mean no dinner? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No dinner. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Thank you for lunch, then. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: By the way, before we go off  the record, 
though, Ms. Reporter, I would like you to let him put those notes in 
the right order.  So if you could remove the staple.  This is Exhibit 
172.  I would like you to put those notes in the right order. 
 
MR.RUBALCAVA: And if Mr. Reichardt mails you a copy of that 
bank statement that you requested, will you make that available to 
all the other attorneys so he does not have to send one to all of 
them. 
 
MR.PETROCELLI: Sure.  No problem. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: I think that is the only thing that you still 
want -- is that correct? --is that bank statement? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Apparently. 
 
THE WITNESS: I think that is the only thing that we talked about. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That sounds right. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Okay.  We will get that to you as soon as 
possible. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: While he is looking through those notes, what 
we will do is put on the same stipulation that we have been using 
for the other witnesses, which is that the witness can sign this 
under penalty of perjury; the court reporter is relieved of her 
statutory duties under the Code; the original transcript will go to 
you; the witness will have 30 days from your receipt in which to 
review and sign it, and if necessary, make any changes, though the 
witness is admonished that those changes, if he does make any, 
could have an adverse effect on his credibility. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Would or could? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Could.  You will return the transcript to me 
within 30 days.  If we do not get a transcription to you within 30 
days, then a copy may be used in lieu of the original in the form 
transcribed.  Is that acceptable? 
 
THE WITNESS: Should I number these for you?  That is how the 
sequence should be. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You know what, why don't you number them.  
For the record, this is Exhibit No. 172 starting with your 
handwritten notes.  Why don't you put numbers at the top. 
 
THE WITNESS: (Witness complies.) 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: And also before we go off the record, may I 
have a stipulation from you, Mr. Rubalcava, that the originals of 
these materials will be preserved, they will not be tampered with, 
destroyed, or discarded -- 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Changed or modif 
ied. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: And they will not be changed or modified, 
and they will be made available to us at the time of trial? 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Yes.  When we get close to trial -- I don't 
know what your date is for trial -- and I don't know when -- 
 
MR.PETROCELLI: September 9 is our trial date. 
 
MR.RUBALCAVA: We may have some conflict.  I don't know 
how long your trial is going to go and I have no idea -- 
 
MR. BREWER: I think it is more than two weeks. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Given Mr. Reichardt's deposition testimony, 
we will very likely want him as a witness, so we will let you know. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Okay. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
MR. RUBALCAVA: Because there will be some schedule 
conflicts potentially, and we want to make sure we know what they 
are early on. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you. 
 
MR.BREWER: Stipulate as to the transcript. 
 
(ENDING TIME: 3:28 P.M.) 
 
I DECLARE UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY THAT THE 
FOREGOING IS TRUE AND CORRECT.

She never showed up at our house. 
 
Q: Who? 
 
A: Alvia Alionzo. 
 
Q: Did you sue Alvia?

MR. BAKER: Let me put my objection on the record. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Please. Go ahead.

THE WITNESS: Thank you.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  
 
Q: Did you sue Alvia? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q : Have you ever asked Alvia whether she took the picture?

Q: When was Alvia working in your home? 
 
A: When?  
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: On -- during the time when she worked for Nicole, and she 
worked for me on weekends, and then when Nicole died I hired her 
full time because she didn't have a job. 
 
Q: When did you first have Alvia work in your home part time 
while she was still working for Nicole? Can you give me a time 
frame, please? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Month? Year? Anything? 
 
A: Well, it was during the time when Nicole moved to Bundy, so --   
 
Q: It was after that? 
 
A: I would say a month after, you know. 
 
Q: February of 1994? 
 
A: You can say that.

Q: Who took the photograph. Excuse me. Who shot the 
photograph?

Q:  -- photograph? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Well, I --  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Is there anything else in that lawsuit that you are contending 
having to do in any way, shape or form with Nicole Brown 
Simpson or O.J. Simpson?  
 
MR. BAKER: I am going to object as irrelevant and calls for a 
legal conclusion. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You can answer. 
 
A: I'm sorry. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You want to repeat the question? 
 
Q: Let me make something clear: You will hear lawyers objecting 
from time to time. You are to disregard those objections, unless 
your own lawyer tells you not to answer a question. Okay? 
 
A: Okay. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Read the question back, please. 
 
(Pending question read as follows: 
 
"Q. Is there anything else in that lawsuit that you are contending 
having to do in any way, shape or form with Nicole Brown 
Simpson or O.J. Simpson?") 
 
MR. KRAMER: If you know. He is asking your understanding. 
 
THE WITNESS: No, that's it. It's just a picture. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Just about the picture? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: How long was your deposition? 
 
THE WITNESS: How long was my deposition? 
 
MR. KRAMER: He is asking -- I am not -- he is asking for your 
recollection. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Yeah, just yours. You can't go to your lawyer for answers 
during the deposition. 
 
A: About two hours. 
 
Q: Do you have a copy of it, a written copy of it? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you bring it with you? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. I think it's responsive to the subpoena. 
I would ask that it be produced tomorrow. I'd be happy to make a 
copy of it. 
 
MR. BAKER: Could I see that subpoena? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah. I am going to ask her some questions 
about it, about all the documents here. 
 
Q: Is that the only deposition you've ever given? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So I take it you've never been examined under oath about this 
case at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or about the facts and circumstances surrounding Nicole's 
death. Is that right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Have you ever made any public statements in the form of 
interviews or other lengthy statements about the facts and 
circumstances of this case? 
 
A: I've done a couple. 
 
Q: What have you done? 
 
A: I don't remember -- I mean, I did Barbara Walters. I did HARD 
COPY when they did -- for Nicole's birthday, we did a little bit of 
a -- who Nicole was. 
 
Q: Barbara Walters and HARD COPY did interviews that aired on 
television. Is that what you're saying? 
 
A: Yes. Yes. I don't know. A few of the television [sic]. You know, 
Channel 2 when they walked into my house. 
 
Q: Channel 2 walked into your house? 
 
A: Oh, yeah, Harvey Levin.  
 
Q: Harvey Levin? 
 
A: Yes. Walked into my house. 
 
Q: And you did an interview with him at that time? 
 
A: Well, I had no choice. He put the mike right in front of my face, 
so... 
 
Q: So the answer is yes? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Any others? 
 
A: I'm thinking. I think that's about it.  
 
Q: Have you issued any interviews in print? 
 
A: In print?  
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Yeah. I did -- we did before the --  that was the Christmas story. 
The Star did an article about my Christmas celebration with 
Simpson. 
 
Q: Which Christmas?

"Raging Heart," I spoke to her one time.

Times. 
 
Q: L.A. Times interviewed you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: On how many occasions? 
 
A: They just did one article about Nicole. 
 
Q: Any others?  
 
A: That's it. 
 
MR. KRAMER: You're asking about interviews for publications? 
Is that the scope of your question? 
 
MR.PETROCELLI: As opposed to what, Mr. Kramer? 
 
MR. KRAMER: As opposed to having meetings, interviews in 
connection with the underlying criminal case and --  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes, publications, any kind of media. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, well --  
 
MR. KRAMER: You understood that to be the question? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Not for lawyers. I will get into lawyers. 
 
A: These are just interviews that they -- 
 
Q: Press, media people. 
 
A: Yes, exactly. That's fine. 
 
Q: Okay. You get paid for any of this?  
 
A: The Star. 
 
Q: How much did the Star pay you?  
 
A: They paid me fifteen for that. 
 
Q: Fifteen what? 
 
A: 15,000. 
 
Q: What did you do for $15,000?  
 
A: What did I do? 
 
Q: Yeah, what did you do? 
 
A: Well, I wrote a -- they wrote an article about what we did at 
Christmas because I wanted to -- at that time I wanted a good story 
about Nicole. I was just tired of all this bad things about Nicole, 
and I thought that I would say something about the type of family

A: Oh, a book agent is a literary agent. Right? 
 
Q: Literary agent, right, someone to represent you. 
 
A: At the time, yes. It was -- it's called Fifi, F-i-f-i, Agency in New 
York. 
 
Q: F-i-f-i Agency. And who at Fifi was working with you on the 
book at that time? 
 
A: It was Brooke Skulski was supposed to be my collaborator on 
that book, but we had a year contract, and it expired November 5th, 
'95. 
 
Q: So you entered into that contract around November of --  
 
A: November, right. 
 
Q:  -- '94? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You have to let me ask my question because he can't get us both 
down at same time. Then you can answer, and I won't interrupt 
you. 
 
So you had a one-year contract with Fifi Agency? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you ever meet Brooke Skulski? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you ever do any writing with her? 
 
A: Yes. Not writing. Yeah, we did. 
 
Q: You sat and had sessions with her? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:How many? 
 
A: I don't know. We had two weeks of sessions at that time. 
 
Q: Were they tape-recorded? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And were any manuscripts produced? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you see any written material at all? 
 
A: She saw me sample of that.  
 
Q: She what? 
 
A: She gave me a sample of -- you know, she gave me like eight 
pages of what I said to her. 
 
Q: Just one time --   
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  -- eight pages?  
 
A: Yes. Yes. 
 
Q: Nothing else she gave you? 
 
A: Well, that was pretty much. Not more. She couldn't find a 
publisher, so --  
 
Q: Are you saying that there were only eight pages that were ever 
written down by Brooke Skulski based on her work with you? 
 
A: That's what she gave me, yes. 
 
Q: Do you know of any other pages that she wrote besides the 
eight? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Have you ever asked to see? 
 
A: I never asked. 
 
Q: Did you ask for the material back when you entered into the 
contract with John Taplin Williams, who is writing your new 
book? 
 
A: John Taylor Williams?  
 
Q: John Taylor Williams.  
 
A: Did I ask for the tapes or whatever? 
 
Q: Yes, the tapes or the written materials or anything else that she 
produced. 
 
A: When that contract expired with Brooke Skulski, I asked for 
those tapes, and she refused to give it back to me because she said 
it's her tape. 
 
And I said, you know, "It's my life story," so she -- I don't have 
possession of it. 
 
Q: What about the eight pages? Where are they? 
 
A: Well, I don't have it anymore.  
 
Q: Threw them away? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: When did you throw them away? 
 
A: Well, I can find -- I can look in my, you know -- I don't know. I 
moved --  
 
Q: You were subpoenaed with these materials. You were supposed 
to bring them here to the deposition today, and I can't complete it 
without those materials. 
 
A: Okay. 
 
MR. KRAMER: This actually is an ideal time for me to assert 
certain privacy rights that Cora Fischman has. She told me that she 
had no documents, and I informed your office or had my associate 
informed your office. 
 
If it turns out that she does have documents, we are not waiving 
her rights of privacy protected by Article I, Section 1, of the 
California Constitution, and I would want to look at whatever 
documents she has to make certain that the disclosure of those 
documents don't somehow invade or impede her right of privacy. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Well, that all should have been done 
before today. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Well, actually the Rutter Group has a section that 
says that now is the appropriate time for --  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am not interested in your lecturing me on 
the law. I only want to get the documents that I subpoenaed, and it 
seems to me that you've made no effort to find them, and I am now 
going to have to examine the witness on what she did to locate 
these documents. 
 
THE WITNESS: You know, I've moved a couple times --  
 
MR. KRAMER: Hold on. Hold on. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: We will get into that, how many times you 
moved. Okay? Let's focus on what we were talking about before. 
 
MR. KRAMER: I have no intention of lecturing you on the law.  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.  
 
MR. KRAMER: All I want to do is preserve the rights of my 
client, which I have now done. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I have --  
 
MR. BAKER: No concern about the rights of his client? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I have no problem with what you want to do 
on behalf of your client. There is no need to thrust over the table 
Rutter Group materials to me. 
 
Q: So let's get back to what I was asking you. Where are the eight 
pages? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
MR.BAKER: I think she's been asked and answered. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I don't care. 
 
Q: Answer it again. 
 
A: I said I don't know. 
 
MR. BAKER: You don't care if you are asking questions over and 
over harassing the witness? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I don't care to comment, Mr. Baker. Let's just 
get on with the deposition. You are just wasting time. 
 
Q: Please, Miss Fischman, answer the question. 
 
A: I said I don't know. But I can look. I will look for it. 
 
Q: Have you looked for anything? 
 
A: Have I looked for anything? 
 
Q: In response to my subpoena. 
 
A: Yes, I did. 
 
Q: Where did you look? 
 
A: Well, you know, I've looked in my boxes. I've moved twice 
already, so... But I didn't think that was important. 
 
Q: I have subpoenaed every single thing that you have in your 
possession: Tape-recordings, documents, pieces of paper, notes, 
calendars, anything at all about O.J. Simpson and about Nicole 
Brown Simpson --  
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q: -- or anything related in any way to the various issues that are 
enumerated in the subpoena. 
 
Did you ever see a copy of the subpoena? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. When did you first see it? 
 
A: That subpoena?  
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: When it was handed to me. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let me mark this as Exhibit 1. 
 
(Discussion held off the record.) 
 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 151 was marked for identification by the 
reporter 
and is attached hereto.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Let me show you Exhibit 151, which is a subpoena duces tecum 
requesting you to appear here and bring materials with you. 
 
When did you first see a copy of that subpoena or the original of 
it? 
 
A: When did I see this? The day that the man gave this to me. 
 
Q: And what records did you search? 
 
A: What records did I search? You know, I really never paid 
attention to it because I thought I didn't have any records of 
anything, so... 
 
Q: Well, you were required by law to pay attention to it, so will 
you tonight search everything in your possession, custody and 
control --  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  -- in response to that subpoena? 
 
MR. BAKER: You don't need to take legal advice from Mr. 
Petrocelli. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: Yes, sir. 
 
Q: Will you do so?  
 
A: Yes, sir. 
 
Q: Including photographs, any notes, any handwritten pieces of 
paper, anything, tape recordings, anything. 
 
A: Yes, sir. 
 
Q: Are you aware of any tape recordings that in any way relate to 
Nicole Brown Simpson or O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: Not aware of any. 
 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
MR. KELLY: I'm sorry. I can't hear you, Miss Fischman. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: What do you mean, you don't know? 
 
A: What do you mean, aware of tapes? 
 
Q: Yeah. Are there any tape recordings that you've ever made other 
than the ones that you've mentioned with regards to Brooke 
Skulski? 
 
A: That's the only one I have. 
 
Q: Okay. The only one you have? 
 
A: I don't have it, but the only one I did, with Brooke Skulski. 
 
Q: That's the only one you're aware of? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you think -- Withdrawn. Do you know where those seven 
or eight pages of manuscripts are? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You are going to look? 
 
A: I don't know. Yes, I am going to look. 
 
Q: Where do you live now? 
 
A: On [Address Deleted]. 
 
Q: When did you move in there?  
 
A: November of '95.  
 
Q: '95?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where did you live before that?  
 
MR. KRAMER: Just the street.  
 
THE WITNESS: Goshen.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: What's the address on Goshen? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Why do you need to know that? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I want to know. 
 
THE WITNESS: [Address Deleted] 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: [Address Deleted]? 
 
MR. BAKER: Just to be clear, there is some concerns that this 
information gets disseminated. What we have been doing on 
personal information is having him write it down and kept in the 
possession of plaintiffs' attorney. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: There is nothing confidential about a prior 
address. 
 
MR. KRAMER: This is a prior address. This is why --  
 
MR. BAKER: Well, I'm just  --  you are obviously going to ask 
about the 15th Street address, I assume, and if you do, just so we're 
clear, that can be handled in a way to protect Miss Fischman's 
privacy. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Thank you. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You live on 15th Street in Santa Monica now? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you lived at [Address Deleted] before? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How long did you live at Goshen Avenue? 
 
A: One year. 
 
Q: From 11-94 to 11-95?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where did you live before Goshen Avenue? 
 
A: Rockingham Avenue.  
 
Q: 200?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: How long did you live at [Address Deleted]?  
 
A: Since 1986. 
 
Q: l986 to -94?  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Does Ron Fischman still reside there? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Who do you live with currently? 
 
MR. KRAMER: None of your business. 
 
You don't have to answer that. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't live with anyone. With my children. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: How many children do you have?  
 
A: I have three children.  
 
Q: What are their names? 
 
A: Michael Alan, Leslie Allison and Nicole Adele. 
 
Q: Michael Alan. Correct? 
 
A: Leslie Fisch- -- I mean Leslie Allison. 
 
Q: Allison, right.  
 
A: And Nicole. 
 
Q: What is Nicole's middle name?  
 
A: Adele. 
 
Q: Adele. And how old is Michael Alan? 
 
A: 12. 
 
Q: And how old -- 
 
A: 10. 
 
Q:  -- is Leslie Allison? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Let him finish his question. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And how old is Nicole? 
 
A: Seven. 
 
Q: And they all live with you. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And does anyone else live with you? 
 
MR. BAKER: This is totally irrelevant.  
 
THE WITNESS: No one. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Okay. And have you lived with the three children the entire 
time at 15th Street in Santa Monica? 
 
A: Entire time? 
 
Q: Yeah, that you've been there. 
 
A: I share it with my husband, so we share custody, so --  
 
Q: And the children stay where?  
 
A: I don't get it. 
 
Q: What I am trying to find outis this: Has anyone else resided 
with you in Santa Monica --  
 
A: Nobody --  
 
Q:  -- other than your children?  
 
A: Exactly. 
 
 
Q: No one else. Correct? 
 
A: No one else. 
 
Q: And has anyone else resided with you at Goshen Avenue other 
than your children? 
 
A: Exactly. 
 
Q: Correct? 
 
A: My kids, yes. 
 
Q: Now, you said something about custody. Are you divorced? 
 
A: I'm in the process of getting divorced. 
 
Q: Okay. That's not complete yet? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And you became separated from your husband when you moved 
into Goshen Avenue in November of '94. Is that correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And before November of '94 you were at all times residing at 
200 North Rockingham? 
 
A: All times? 
 
Q: Up -- down to 1986. 
 
A: No. I lived on Barrington one time in 1990. 
 
Q: For a short period of time?  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: How long? 
 
A: For six months.  
 
Q: Alone? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: While you were separated from your husband? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. 19- -- in 1990 you lived on Barrington for six months in 
an apartment. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And other than that six-month interval, from 1986 until 
November of 1994 you resided at all times at 200 North 
Rockingham. Is --  
 
A: Exactly. 
 
Q:  -- that correct?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Is Nicole Adele named after Nicole Brown, first name? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Nothing to do with her?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Who does Ron Fischman currently reside with?  
 
A: Who he does --   
 
Q: (Nods head.) 
 
A: No one. 
 
Q: He lives alone? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. When did you file for divorce? 
 
MR. BAKER: Irrelevant. 
 
THE WITNESS: June of '95.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did you file for legal separation before then? 
 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So the first legal proceeding was June of '95. Right? 
 
A: Was November. When I moved in November, that was basically 
-- the lawyer said we were legally separated when I moved out in 
November. 
 
Q: Were papers filed with the court then? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Whatever your lawyer might have told you, that's 
between you and your lawyer. Okay? 
 
THE WITNESS: Okay. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Were papers filed in November of '94? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Who is your divorce lawyer? 
 
MR. BAKER: Let me just state that the divorce status -- the 
marital status of a non-party witness is completely out of bounds 
and totally irrelevant to this litigation.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  
 
Q: You may answer. What is the name of your divorce lawyer? 
 
A: I'm changing it, so I don't have anyone right now. 
 
Q: Well, who was the last divorce lawyer you had? 
 
A: We have a mediator. His name is Mr. Marsden. 
 
Q: But who is the name of your lawyer? 
 
A: Mr. Weissman. 
 
Q: What's his first name?  
 
A: Ken Weissman. 
 
Q: Okay. And who is Mr. Fischman's lawyer? 
 
A: I don't know. I've forgot his name.  
 
Q: Do you have a new lawyer, divorce lawyer? 
 
A: Planning to, yes. 
 
Q: And what's his or her name? 
 
A: Her name is Miss La Guardia.  
 
Q: First name?  
 
A: Maryanne.  
 
Q: Maryanne? 
 
A: Uh-huh. Yes. 
 
Q: Have any depositions been taken in your divorce case? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, going back to the time when you were paid $15,000 by 
Star Magazine, you said that you wanted to say some good things 
about the Simpsons because bad things were being said about 
Nicole. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. What bad things were being said about Nicole? 
 
A: Bad things? 
 
Q:Yeah. 
 
A: Well, the way she was portrayed by the media. 
 
Q: How was she being portrayed? 
 
A: How? Just didn't like the way she was portrayed by the tabloid 
with like this happy-go-lucky woman, you know. That's not the 
woman that I knew.  
 
Q: Any other bad things that were being said or were portrayed 
about her that you objected to and wanted to set the record straight 
about? 
 
A: I don't remember. To me everything was bad when it all came 
out.  
 
Q: What about her was bad that you specifically objected to that 
caused you to --  
 
A: Yeah, all the pictures --   
 
Q: Star Magazine? 
 
A: All the tabloids, all these different men. I mean... 
 
Q: The fact that she was being portrayed as a woman who dated 
lots of men? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And that bothered you?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Any time you want to take a break, please feel free to do so. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Need a minute? 
 
Let's take just a moment. All right?  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Sure. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the 
time is approximately 10:19. 
 
(Recess.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 10:28. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Off -- right before the break you were telling me that you had -- 
were having real problems with Nicole being portrayed as a kind of 
loose woman dating many men. You were objecting to Nicole's 
portrayal as a loose woman. 
 
Do you recall that testimony? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And as a result, you felt compelled to come out and say 
something in her behalf. Is that right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did you say in her behalf? 
 
 
A: Well, I tried to humanize Nicole. You know, she was a mom. 
She was  -- we did a lot of things together as mom, not just those 
going out clubbing and going out with different men and stuff like 
that. She was portrayed negatively by the media, so... 
 
Q: Did you read any books that portrayed her negatively? 
 
A: Books?  
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: There was Faye Resnick's book.  
 
Q: You read that book? 
 
A: I didn't read it. I glanced through it. 
 
Q: And in glancing through it, you saw material in there that you 
thought was objectionable? 
 
A: I thought it was tasteless.  
 
Q: What material was that? 
 
A: Faye Resnick book. 
 
Q: What material in the Resnick book did you regard as tasteless? 
 
A: I think overall the book was. 
 
Q: Overall? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: But you never read it. You just glanced through it. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you don't like Faye Resnick. Do you? 
 
A: I don't like -- I mean, it's not that. I just feel sorry for her. 
 
Q: Why? 
 
A: Just the type of woman she is. 
 
Q: What type of woman is she? 
 
A: Well, I think as Nicole and I used to call her the drama queen, 
so that speaks for itself.  
 
Q: What does that mean? 
 
A: She's a very -- I don't know. To me I never trusted that woman, 
the first day I met her. 
 
Q: Did you tell her that? 
 
A: Well, no. Cici Shahian told me; Chris Jenner told me --  
 
Q: Told you what? 
 
A: That, "Watch out for Faye. She's a very high-maintenance 
woman." 
 
Q: Was she your friend? 
 
A: No, she was not my friend. 
 
Q: Never socialized with Faye Resnick? 
 
A: I socialized with Faye because of Nicole, you know, but she 
pretty much was Nicole's friend. 
 
Q: Did you try to persuade Nicole not to have a relationship with 
Faye? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: On numerous occasions? 
 
A: Well, I would say yes. 
 
Q: Starting when? 
 
A: The first time I met her and when -- 
 
Q: When was that? 
 
A: I don't remember. When she used to live on Gretna Green. 
 
Q: When Nicole lived on Gretna Green? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: First time you met Faye Resnick? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You don't know what month that is or year? 
 
A: Must be the summer of '93. 
  
Q: So from the summer of '93 --  
 
A: Summer, summer. I don't know about -- June, July, around that 
time. 
 
Q: From around the summer of 1993 until Nicole's death, you tried 
to persuade Nicole not to be friends with Faye Resnick? 
 
A: Well, a couple of times I did that. One time was with O.J. I said 
to Nicole and 
 O.J., "I don't trust Faye." 
 
And Nicole said, "Oh, come on, Cora, you know, loosen up." 
 
Q: Loosen up? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And at some point did you accept  -- come to accept Nicole's 
friendship with Faye? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you would go out with Nicole and Faye. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. So you could have chosen to stay home, but you went 
with them. Right? 
 
A: I didn't go out a lot -- most -- a lot -- you know, I didn't -- I 
probably went like couple times, two, three times with them, but I 
didn't go out every time with them. 
 
Q: You've only been out three times together with Nicole and Faye 
Resnick? 
 
A: Something like that. Two, three times. I mean --  
 
Q: I don't mean just the three of you alone, but any time you were -
-  
 
A: Oh, no, no, no. I mean --  you mean with other groups, you 
mean?  
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Well, then more than three times.  
 
Q: How many? 
 
A: I don't know.  
 
Q: Hundreds? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: 20? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Less than 20? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: 10? 
 
A: Probably. Yes. 
 
Q: So 10 times you were in the same group as Faye, and only three 
times Nicole, Faye and you were together alone. Is that about 
right? 
 
A: Just the three of us?  
 
Q: Yes. 
 
MR. KRAMER: You're asking about being out, clubbing or 
something, out? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Anywhere. 
 
THE WITNESS: No  --  I would say yeah, about three times. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever spend any time alone with Faye Resnick? 
 
A: One time I drove her to the car rental. That's about it. That's the 
only time I was with her alone. 
 
Q: When was that? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Before Nicole's death?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you ever talk to her on the phone? 
 
A: When? 
 
Q: At any time. 
 
A: Yes, of course. 
 
Q: You and Faye Resnick?  
 
A: Yes. She -- yeah. 
 
Q: She would call you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you would converse with her on the phone? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Numerous times. Right?  
 
A: I would say yes. 
 
Q: Now, isn't it true that you had conversations with Faye Resnick 
about writing a book together after Nicole's death? 
 
A: Not writing a book together, no. 
 
Q: And no discussions with her about collaborating on a book --  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- or writing books together?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you have discussions with Faye that you would be 
writing a book? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have any conversadons at all with Faye Resnick after Nicole's 
death about writing of books? 
 
A: She told me that she's planning on writing a book, so that was 
the conversation. 
 
Q: What did you say?  
 
A: What did I say? 
 
Q: (Nods head.) 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know if anything in her book is false? 
 
A: Is false? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
MR. BAKER: I think she said she skimmed it. You're asking her --  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Browsed it. Or "glanced" is what she said. 
 
THE WlTNESS: I don't know. The whole thing is she --  
 
MR. KRAMER: The question was: Is there anything that you read 
in the book that you perceive to be false? 
 
THE WITNESS: To be false? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Untrue. 
 
A: The tone. The tone of that is so untrue, you know. 
 
Q: What tone are you referring to? 
 
A: She has a lot of anger in that book.  
 
Q: Anger about whom. 
 
A: About O.J. and --  
 
Q: What's false about that anger? 
 
A: About how, you know, all this anger that -- the violent anger of 
O.J. --  
 
 
Q: You think that's false? 
 
A: Well, to me I never saw it, so... 
 
Q: You know O.J. Simpson has a violent temper. Right? 
 
A: I know that. 
 
Q: You know that to be true. Correct? 
 
A: I have not seen him, though. 
 
Q: You know that to be true, correct, that he has a violent temper? 
 
MR. KRAMER: That calls for a yes or no, if you know. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. I have not seen him get angry. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Have you ever told anyone that O.J. Simpson had a violent 
temper? Yes or no. 
 
A: Have I said?  
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Were you lying when you said that? 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  
 
Q: You may answer. 
 
A: Was I lying? I probably was unsure. 
 
Q: You said -- Who did you tell that O.J. Simpson had a violent 
temper? 
 
A: Nicole told me one time. She said it like, "Oh, God, it's like -- 
you know, like typical husband. When they get  -- when they 
scream, they scream, and we get mad at them," so... 
 
Q: Who did you tell that O.J. Simpson had a violent temper? 
 
A: Who? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Were you telling the truth when you said that? 
 
A: I probably was -- at that time I was like -- there was a lot of 
confusion, so, see, it's all hearsay, what Nicole told me. 
 
Q: No, I am not asking you that. I am asking whether you told the 
truth when you told someone that O.J. Simpson had a violent 
temper. 
 
Were you telling the truth? 
 
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: Was I telling the truth? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: If I tell -- if I'm telling the truth if I saw him? I never saw him 
with a violent temper, though. 
 
Q: You didn't answer my question. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Do you understand the question? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You told someone that O.J. Simpson had a violent temper. 
When you did so, were you telling the truth? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Either you were or you weren't or you don't know. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: There is no need to coach the witness. 
 
MR. KRAMER: I have no interest in coaching the witness. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The questions are crystal clear. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember. 
 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You don't remember if you were telling the truth? 
 
A: Well, you know, there was a lot of confusion. You know, my 
girlfriend died. You know, there was just all these things going on. 
The media was saying, "What do you think? What do you think?" I 
mean --  
 
Q: You were confused about whether O.J. Simpson had a violent 
temper? 
 
A: Because I never saw that temper, I never saw that violent 
behavior. Nicole had mentioned to me, she says, "Oh, Nicole" -- 
she says that O.J. can get mad. 
 
I said, "Oh, the same as Ron," so... 
 
Q: Let me tell you this: We are not talking about Ron Fischman 
now. 
 
MR. BAKER: You are cutting her off. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: We'll get to Ron Fischman later on. We are talking about O.J. 
Simpson. Okay? 
 
When Nicole told you that O.J. Simpson had a violent temper, do 
you think she was telling you the truth? 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: At the time I believed her. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did you believe her? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And did you know of any reason she had to lie to you at 
that time? 
 
A: There was no reason, no. 
 
Q: You were a dear friend of hers. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And she of yours. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: In fact, you say that you were her closest friend. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: For a number of years up to the time of her death. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, have you learned since Nicole's told you that O.J. 
Simpson had a violent temper that she was not telling you the truth 
at that time? Have you learned that statement by her to be false? 
 
A: Have I -- no. 
 
Q: Have you learned of anything to indicate to you that Nicole was 
lying to you when she told you that O.J. Simpson had a violent 
temper? 
 
MR. BAKER: I am going to say it mischaracterizes her testimony. 
I don't recall her saying that Nicole told her that she --  that he had 
a violent temper. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You can try and put as many words in this 
witness' mouth as you want. You can cross-examine her to your 
heart's delight when I am concluded with my examination. 
 
Q: You may answer. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Do you have the question in mind? 
 
THE WlTNESS: No. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Could we have the question back, please? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Please read the question. 
 
THE WITNESS: Could you repeat the question, please? 
 
(Pending question read as follows: 
 
"Q. Have you learned of anything to indicate to you that Nicole 
was lying to you when she told you that O.J. Simpson had a violent 
temper?") 
 
THE WITNESS: Nicole was not lying.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Okay. And you have not learned anything since Nicole told you 
that to indicate that she was lying to you at that time. Is that right? 
 
A: Have I learned? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: I don't know how tn answer that. 
 
Q: Have you, since the time Nicole told you that, learned that that 
statement is not true? 
 
A: Never thought of it. 
 
Q: Have you -- has anyone told you it was false? Have you read 
anything, have you learned anything, to indicate to you that the 
statement that Nicole made to you was false? That's all I'm asking 
you. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Thank you. You observed O.J. Simpson and Nicole interacting 
quite a bit during the course of your relationship with them. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you spent many, many hours with Nicole alone. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And she talked to you often about her feelings towards Mr. 
Simpson and her relationship with him. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you've also had some conversations with O.J. Simpson 
about his relationship with Nicole and his feelings about her. 
Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you've been together with them alone, and you've been 
together with them in groups of people. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So you've had as much opportunity as perhaps anyone in the 
last four years of Nicole's life to observe them interacting. Is that 
right? 
 
MR. KRAMER: If you know. 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: If -- I'm sorry. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You've had as much opportunity as anyone to observe them in 
the last three or four years of Nicole's life. Right? 
 
A: As much opportunity? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, in your opinion was Mr. Simpson a jealous man when it 
came to Nicole? 
 
A: I thought he was. 
 
Q: Was he a controlling man when it came to Nicole? 
 
A: Controlling in what way? 
 
Q: Controlling towards Nicole, tried to control her. 
 
A: Nicole said yes, yeah. 
 
Q: And you observed that to be true also. Right? 
 
A: Controlling, I would say yes, at the time. 
 
Q: And Mr. Simpson was, based on your observations, also 
obsessive, acted obsessively towards Nicole, didn't he? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Do you understand what that means? 
 
THE WITNESS: Obsessive? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Yeah, you know what that means. 
 
By the way, just so your lawyer doesn't have to interrupt and ask 
you, if there isn't -- if you don't understand my question, just ask 
me, and I will be happy to try to explain them to you. 
 
 
A: What do you mean by "obsessively"? 
 
Q: Obsessive, act obsessively towards Nicole. 
 
MR. BAKER: That's not the greatest definition I've ever heard. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I don't want to define it. 
 
Q: You --  
 
A: They were both obsessed with each other. 
 
Q: Was O.J. Simpson obsessed with Nicole? Yes or no. 
 
MR. BAKER: If you can answer it with a yes or no. 
 
THE WITNESS: Obsession, what do you mean by "obsession"? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Miss Fischman, you just told me they were both obsessed with 
each other. Correct? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Now I am just asking you: Was O.J. Simpson obsessed with 
Nicole? 
 
Do you have trouble answering that question? 
 
A: Well, because what Nicole told me  --  Nicole told me that O.J. 
was obsessed with her. 
 
Q: Did you agree with that? 
 
A: See, but at the time I never realy saw him that often, so I never 
really saw the obsession. 
 
Q: Later on did you see the obsession? 
 
MR. BAKER: You're cutting her off.  
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Never saw any evidence of obsession? 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative and asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And never told anybody that O.J. Simpson was obsessive 
towards Nicole. Is that right? 
 
A: Well, at the time when Nicole died, I said that there was a 
problem at the time that they were obsessed with each other. 
 
Q: When you say, "they were obsessed with each other," by that 
you mean that O.J. Simpson was obsessed with Nicole and Nicole 
was obsessed with O.J. Simpson. Is that right? 
 
A: It's --  
 
Q: Is that right? 
 
A: I would say right. 
 
Q: Do you think Mr. Simpson killed Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you think he's innocent? 
 
A: At first I thought he did but then when the evidence came, it just 
didn't work out. The two didn't match. 
 
Q: What evidence made you conclude Mr. Simpson did not kill 
Nicole? 
 
A: The evidence were just too enormous. There was just --  
 
MR. KELLY: I'm sorry. I can't hear you, Miss Fischman. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: The evidence of Mr. Simpson's innocence is just too enormous. 
Is that what you're saying? 
 
A: Right, yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. So you are not aware of any evidence incriminating Mr. 
Simpson. Is that what you're saying? 
 
A: What does that mean? 
 
MR. KRAMER: You don't know what it means? Would you 
rephrase the question? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
Q: Are you aware of any evidence that points towards Mr. 
Simpson's guilt as the person who killed Nicole? 
 
MR. BAKER: Object to the term "evidence." 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, she understood it very clearly when she 
said there was enormous evidence of his innocence. 
 
Q: Are you aware of any evidence of his guilt? That's all I'm asking 
you. 
 
A: That he loved Nicole. 
 
Q: Now, you said there was a time when you thought that he did it. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When was that? 
 
A: When all this thing happened, when Nicole just died and 
everybody was saying O.J. did it, and the media came to me and 
says, "When was their last fight?" It's like the media said O.J. did 
it. So we all based it from he did it, so --  
 
Q: So you just believed the media. Is that what you're saying? 
 
A: It was a lot of confusion. 
 
MR. BAKER: You have now cut her off three times. 
 
THE WITNESS: You know what it is? It was my girlfriend died. I 
was so confused; I was shocked; I didn't know what was going on; 
the media was after me, and friends were saying, "He did it." 
 
So we said, "Okay, if he did it, what did he do? How did he do it?" 
So that's how all of us were thinking about that. And then when all 
the evidences came out, we started saying, "Wait a minute. It didn't 
match. What's going on?" 
 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: What didn't match? What didn't match? 
 
A: What didn't match?  
 
Q: Yes. 
 
 
A: The gloves, why was one there and one --  and there was no 
blood around. If he's the one who did it, why was there no blood 
around the house. I mean, his carpet is white. Why was there no 
bloodstain on the carpet around. And the socks, why was there no 
blood around the socks. If he took a shower, why were there no  -- 
you know. 
 
Q: Why were there no what? 
 
A: No blood in the shower, nothing.  
 
Q: Who were the friends that were saying that O.J. did it? 
 
A: I don't have any friends, so...Who were the friends of who? 
 
Q: You said earlier the friends were saying O.J. did it. Who were 
those friends? 
 
A: Nicole's friends, I guess.  
 
Q: Who were they? 
 
A: Cici Shahian, Kris Jenner, Faye Resnick. 
 
Q: Who else? 
 
A: Those are the people I know that she hang out with. 
 
Q: And those are the people who told you that O.J. did it. Is that 
right? 
 
A: Yeah. And they told me that he did it or else they will not talk 
to me ever again. 
 
Q: What does that mean? 
 
A: There was a thing, says, "If" --  "either you say O.J. did it, we'll 
group ourselves, and this is what we gonna do." 
 
Q: So you're saying that you had a meeting with Cici, Faye and 
Kris in which they all approached you and said that you were to 
agree that O.J. did it or else they would never talk to you again. Is 
that right? 
 
A: It's more like that and --  
 
Q: Is that what you're saying?  
 
A: Pretty much, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Where did this meeting occur? 
 
A: Not meeting. It was all conversation, and I had a -- I had dinner 
with -- 
 
Q: Dinner with whom? 
 
A: With Cici Shahian and Robin Greer, and that's it, and they told 
me that I have to support them or else they're going to destroy me.  
 
Q: You said Cici and Robin were there? 
 
A: Yeah.  
 
Q: And did Kris Jenner tell you the same thing? 
 
A: No. Kris Jenner just called me a couple times. 
 
Q: So your statement about Kris Jenner being part of this is false 
then. Right? 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Is that what you're now saying? 
 
A: Not part of it's false. She was also there. She was not at the 
meeting, but she was... I don't know how to answer this. 
 
Q: She was what? 
 
A: I met with her also a couple times, and we talked about it, and 
they wanted me to talk to the media on Nicole's behalf, and, you 
know... 
 
Q: Did Kris Jenner tell you that if you didn't say O.J. did it, she 
would never talk to you again? 
 
A: No, she didn't say that. But the Browns did that, told me. Judy 
told me. 
 
Q: Judy told you to say that O.J. did it; otherwise she would never 
talk with you again? 
 
A: No. If I ever talked to O.J., that they would not talk to me ever 
again. 
 
Q: Okay. That's a different question. Who are the people that told 
you to say that O.J. Simpson killed Nicole --  for you to say that, 
and if you didn't say that, they would never talk to you again? 
 
A: Nobody said that to me. 
 
Q: Well, you just told me that there was conversations in which 
Kris Jenner, Robin Greer and Cici Shahian told you to say that. 
Are you now saying that that isn't true? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Gather your thoughts --  
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative, and let her finish her answer. You 
cut her off every time --  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am not cutting her off, Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. BAKER: -- you get an answer that you don't like. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Gather your thoughts, think about your answer 
and answer the question to the best of your ability. Do you have 
the question in mind? Do you need a moment? 
 
THE WITNESS: Would you repeat that question, please? 
 
(Pending question read as follows: 
 
 Q: Well, you just told me that there was conversations in which 
Kris Jenner, Robin Greer and Cici Shahian told you to say that. 
Are you now saying that that isn't true?") 
 
THE WITNESS: No. That's true.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: So they all told you to say that O.J. killed Nicole, and if you 
didn't say that, they would not talk to you again. Is --  
 
A: Pretty much, yes. 
 
Q: And the people who said that were Robin Greer, Cici Shahian 
and Kris Jenner. Is that right? 
 
A: Yes. Faye Resnick.  
 
Q: And Faye Resnick. 
 
A: Judy Brown.  
 
Q: Judy Brown. Anyone else?  
 
A: Those are the people. 
 
Q: And did you agree to go along with that at that time? 
 
A: No. I just didn't want to -- I felt like I should leave it to the 
justice system. I said, "I wasn't there. I was a bystander. I mean, 
I'm not a witness. Nicole didn't call me and said, you know, `O.J. 
just killed me.'" I mean, we were all shocked. We were -- we didn't 
know. 
 
Q: Did you ever tell anybody that you thought O.J. killed Nicole? 
 
A: Yeah, of course. It entered my mind. 
 
Q: What do you mean, "of course"?  
 
A: It entered my mind. 
 
Q: Why did you say "of course"? 
 
A: Because at the time there was just a lot of things going on. I 
mean, they had -- they had --  they were trying to reconcile, and 
Nicole was doing a lot of things, too, on the -- you know, I mean, 
she I wanted to go back, she didn't want to go back, and then, you 
know -- and then at some point -- there was a lot of confusion 
between the two. 
 
O.J. said, "I feel like a battered husband." 
 
And then Nicole says, "I don't know if I should move back. I 
should" -- you know, so, yeah. So when Nicole died, the first thing 
is, oh, my God, what happened here? 
 
Q: The first thing that crossed your mind is that O.J. did it. Right? 
 
A: Exactly. 
 
Q: Did you ask O.J. if he did it?  
 
A: No. He didn't --  
 
Q: You didn't ask him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When did you first see him after Nicole's death? 
 
A: When he got out of prison.  
 
Q: When did you --  
 
A: The week after the verdict. 
 
Q: Well, you saw him at the wake, didn't you? 
 
A: Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm sorry. Yeah, you're right. 
 
Q: And you saw him at the funeral. Right? 
 
A: Yeah, right. I'm sorry. Yeah, that's true. 
 
Q: You talked to him on the telephone also, didn't you? 
 
A: When he was in jail, yeah, he called a couple times. 
 
Q: Now, when you saw him at the wake and the funeral, didn't you 
go up to him and say, "Why did you do this?" 
 
A: No, that's true -- that's not true. I'm sorry. I was hysterical --  
 
 
MR. KRAMER: There is no question pending. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You were hysterical? You may complete your thought. Go 
ahead. 
 
A: I was hysterical; I couldn't believe that Nicole was there, and I 
went to him and I started pounding his chest, and I said, "Who did 
this to my friend? What happened?" 
 
And I was pounding his chest, and I was like really angry. I said, 
"What happened? What happened here? You know, all she wanted 
to do was take care of Sydney and Justin." 
 
And then he said, "I just" -- "I love her. I love her so much, Cora," 
and that was it, and then we were like -- I was... 
 
Q: You deny asking him at that time if he killed Nicole or if he did 
this or if he was responsible for her death? You deny that? 
 
A: Denied what? 
 
Q: Deny asking him that at that time. 
 
A: If he -- I didn't even ask him. I was like --  
 
MR. KRAMER: So the answer is yes, you deny asking him. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You deny asking him. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You have a very clear memory of what you said to him even 
though you were hysterical. Is that right? 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. She's answered this question. 
 
THE WITNESS: I said those, yeah. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  
 
Q: You said what? 
 
A: I said -- those are the words I said, you know, "What happened? 
What happened here?" 
 
Q: Did he say to you, "I loved her too much"? Did he say that to 
you? 
 
A: "I loved her so much." 
 
Q: "So much." Not "too much." You distinctly recall that. Is that 
right? 
 
A: That I don't remember, what -- you know, I was crying 
hysterically. 
 
Q: So you don't remember.  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So he could have said to you, "I loved her too much" --  
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: -- rather than "so much." Is that right? 
 
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered.  
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You don't recall? 
 
A: That -- see, you know, I was crying, I was hysterical --  
 
MR. KRAMER: Cora, you remember the distinction, or you don't? 
That's the question. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember the distinction. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: So it could have been either one. Right? 
 
A: It could have been either one. 
 
Q: Okay. At anytime did you ever ask Mr. Simpson whether he 
killed Nicole, your dear friend? 
 
A: If I asked him? No. 
 
Q: Now, you never asked him. Right? 
 
A: I never asked him. 
 
Q: Up until this day. Is that right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, you said O.J. Simpson entered your mind as the 
person who might have killed Nicole when you first heard of her 
death. 
 
Did any other person enter your mind? 
 
MR. KRAMER: At the time? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
THE WITNESS: At that time, yes --  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Who? 
 
A: -- because, see, Faye Resnick --  see, Faye Resnick was running 
out of money; she didn't have a home, and they were doing a lot of 
-- they were doing cocaine and they were doing  -- they were 
soliciting men, and so they were out almost every night, and so I 
said, "Oh, my God, somebody could have done" -- you know.  
 
Q: I take it, then, that you were with Nicole and Faye when they 
were doing cocaine. Is that right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And I take it you were with Nicole and Faye when they were 
soliciting men. Is that right? 
 
A: I was not with them. 
 
 
Q: I see. So you have no firsthand knowledge of any of that. Is that 
right? Yes or no. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You have no firsthand knowledge that Nicole Brown Simpson 
was doing cocaine at the end --  
 
A: Faye told me. 
 
Q:  -- of her life. You have no firsthand knowledge. You didn't see 
it. Is that right? 
 
A: I didn't see it. 
 
Q: And you didn't see her soliciting men. Is that right? 
 
MR. BAKER: Stop arguing with the witness and pointing at her. 
 
THE WITNESS: I didn't see them, but -- 
 
MR. KRAMER: You didn't see them.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You didn't see them. 
 
A: I didn't see them. 
 
Q: You didn't --  
 
A: I didn't know. 
 
Q: Any man ever come up to you and say that "Nicole Brown 
Simpson solicited me"? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Who? 
 
A: [Name Deleted] 
 
Q: When did [Name Deleted] tell you that? 
 
A: When I saw him at Starbucks coffee with his friend. 
 
Q: After Nicole's death?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what did [Name Deleted] tell you?  
 
A: Well, we were consoling, and he said to me nice things about 
Nicole.  
 
Q: Excuse me. I can't concentrate because Mr. Simpson is talking 
to Mr. Kelly. 
 
A: And they -- and he told me that "I wanted to tell you something 
about Nicole." 
 
I said, "Well" -- then he told me that they went out to dinner, and 
Nicole asked them if they do threesome. 
 
Q: Nicole and [Name Deleted] went out to dinner? 
 
A: And Ron Goldman. Ron Goldman, [Name Deleted] and Nicole. 
That was their first -- they went out to dinner. 
 
Q: This is being related to you by [Name Deleted]. Is that right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And this is sometime after Nicole's death. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When was this? 
 
A: Must be a week, during that week.  
 
Q: Okay. And where did you and [Name Deleted] --  
 
A: Saw --  
 
Q:  -- go? Starbucks, did you say?  
 
A: We didn't go. I saw him at Starbucks coffee. 
 
Q: Just ran into him? 
 
A: Yes, I ran into him. 
 
Q: Middle of the day? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And he just told this to you? 
 
A: Well, he gave me a hug because he knew. 
 
Q: And said, "Oh, by the way, did you know that Nicole was 
soliciting men?" Is that what you told --  
 
A: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: He didn't say it quite that way. 
 
He just gave me a hug and he said, "You know, I'm sorry for what 
happened." 
 
And I said, you know -- and he said nice things about Nicole, and I 
said --  so he asked me about Faye Resnick. I said, "Yeah, you 
know, and" --  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: What did he ask you about Faye Resnick? 
 
A: He said, "Who is Faye Resnick?" I said, "Well, you know, it's 
Nicole and" --  
 
Q: What did you say to him? 
 
A: I said, "This is Nicole's friend." 
 
Q: Okay. Continue. 
 
A: And --  
 
MR. BAKER: Continue with her answer? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
MR. BAKER: So you interrupted her. 
 
THE WITNESS: And he told me that they went out to dinner, and 
Nicole got a little drunk and started asking about that question, and 
he says, "It's not that I want to shock you." 
 
I said, "Well, I know that already. She told me," and that was it. 
So, you know... 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: So that's the extent of the conversation with you and [Name 
Deleted]? 
 
 
A: That was pretty much, you know. And then we still talk about, 
you know  -- that's pretty much the basic. 
 
Q: What did [Name Deleted] say in response to Nicole's 
solicitation? 
 
A: He was embarrassed. 
 
Q: What did he tell you that he said? 
 
A: She [sic] said, "Have you guys done" -- "have you guys done it 
with another woman?" 
 
And [Name Deleted] said they were embarrassed when Nicole 
asked that question, and he says, "With whom?" [Name Deleted] 
said, "With whom?" He says, "With Cora?" 
 
And then Nicole said, "No, not with Cora. With Faye Resnick," 
and that's why [Name Deleted] asked me who Faye Resnick is. 
 
And then -- so when I described to him Faye Resnick, he says, 
"No, no, no," he says, "Cora doesn't do those things," and --  
 
THE REP0RTER: I'm sorry. I can't hear the "he says" or "she 
says." You're dropping your voice. 
 
 (Record read.) 
 
THE WITNESS: No. When [Name Deleted] said, "With Cora?" 
because -- you know, because Nicole and I go to Starbucks coffee a 
lot after our run, and Nicole said, "No, Cora doesn't do those 
things. With Faye Resnick." And so that was it, you know. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: So did Keller tell you whether they went through with this? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did --  
 
A: Then Nicole apologized to them. She said, "Oh, I'm sorry," you 
know, "I'm embarrassed. I'm embarrassing myself. I'm sorry," and 
that was it. 
 
Q: Did Keller tell you whether Nicole's comments were directed to 
him or to Ron Goldman? 
 
A: That I don't know. He didn't specify that. It was pretty much, 
you know, the three of them having conversation. 
 
 
Q: And you said you had already heard that from Nicole before she 
died. Right? 
 
A: Yes, she told me. 
 
Q: How many times? 
 
MR. KRAMER: You are asking how many times did this topic 
come up? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember. Once, twice. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Just relate the conversations to me. 
 
A: Nicole told me that she did -- she did it with Faye and another 
guy, and Faye told me after Nicole died, because I wanted answers, 
I wanted to know if that really happened, and Faye confirmed it.  
 
Q: Confirmed it? 
 
A: Well, she told me. She told me the same thing what Nicole told 
me. 
 
Q: Okay. When did Nicole tell you this? Give me a date. 
 
A: I would say around April, late April. 
 
Q: '94? 
 
A: '94. 
 
Q: Where were you and Nicole when you had this conversation? 
 
A: Starbucks. 
 
Q: Just the two of you?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And was this after her trip to Cabo? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was Mr. Simpson in Puerto Rico at the time? 
 
A: Yes. No. They all went to Cabo, and then -- they all went to 
Cabo, and then he -- I think he went home  -- I don't know. I think 
he went --  probably he went to Puerto Rico at the time. 
 
Q: Mr. Simpson?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And filmed FROGMAN. Right?  
 
A: Yes. Yes. 
 
Q: And Nicole came back to Los Angeles. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And she had a conversation with you at Starbucks in which she 
related to you that she and Faye Resnick had had sex with another 
man. Is that right? 
 
A: That was later, that time. It wasn't right away when they got 
back from Cabo. 
 
Q: Couple weeks later?  
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And did she indicate that this incident occurred in Cabo or in 
Los Angeles? 
 
A: That I don't know, but she told me that they met a guy in Cabo. 
 
Q: And was this the guy that was involved in the incident? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did this incident -- What's that guy's name? 
 
A: Guy's name is Brett. 
 
Q: What's Brett's last name?  
 
A: That I don't know. 
 
Q: Have you ever seen Brett?  
 
A: No, never met him. 
 
Q: Have you ever talked to Brett?  
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: And Nicole identified Brett by name? 
 
A: Uh-huh, yes. 
 
Q: Did Faye also?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Is that the extent of the conversation that you had with Nicole 
about Brett? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you said Nicole mentioned this topic again to you on 
another occasion?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And describe that to me.  
 
A: This must be a week after -- I don't remember, but she kinda 
mentioned it in passing that, "Don't get mad at me, but I" -- "Faye 
and I did it." 
 
Q: Did what? 
 
A: That's exactly what she told me. Did what. They did it. And 
then she started to giggle. 
 
Q: You mean that Faye -- she told you that Faye Resnick and she 
had sex with another man? 
 
A: Well, she told me that "Faye and I did it," so that's as far as I --  
 
Q: What did you understand that to mean? 
 
A: That the two of them had an affair together. 
 
Q: Alone? Or with another man? 
 
A: Alone and with another man. Well, she said they did it, and 
says, "Don't get mad at me." 
 
I said, "I'm not going to get mad at you." 
 
Q: Wait a second. You said, "Alone and with another man." 
 
A: Well, later on she told me that they did it with a man. So they 
did it before, and then they did it with another man. 
 
Q: And she told you this in the second conversation that you had 
with her. You already told me about the first time. 
 
A: Yes. Yes. 
 
Q: Now, when she said, "Don't get mad," had you previously 
expressed your disapproval to her when she related the incident the 
first time? 
 
A: Well, because she knew me --   
 
MR. KRAMER: It's a yes or a no. 
 
THE WITNESS: What -- I'm sorry. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Did you express your disapproval to her when she 
told you the first time, was the question? 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: What did you say when she told you about the incident? 
 
A: What did --  
 
Q: First time. 
 
A: What did who? 
 
Q: What did you say to Nicole? 
 
A: I said "Nicole," and then that's it.  
 
Q: You said "Nicole" and didn't say anything more? 
 
A: I just say, "Be careful." 
 
Q: "Be careful"? About what? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Are you asking her what did she say or what did 
she think? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Yeah, what did you say? 
 
A: That's what I said: "Nicole be careful." 
 
 
Q: What did you have in mind? 
 
A: I had in mind was she was doing something that wasn't right. 
 
Q: You mean morally right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, when she told you the second time, what did you 
say to her then? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Now, when you had a conversation with Resnick after Nicole's 
death, did you ask Resnick about these two incidents that Nicole 
related to you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And she confirmed them both?  
  
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what did you say to Resnick at that time? 
 
A: At that time she was -- actually she was shocked when I told 
her, and she said, "Yeah, I thought" -- "Nicole told me," I said, 
"that you two had an affair, and she told me not to tell you or else 
you're gonna kill her," because Nicole used to say that, "Oh, don't 
tell Faye. Faye's gonna kill me if you tell her that I told you about 
this." 
 
Q: Okay. By the way, do you think Faye Resnick killed Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You don't think that that statement had anything to do with 
Nicole's death? 
 
A: Well, Nicole used that word "kill" a lot, you know, as a figure 
of speech, so I really didn't have -- to me it was like I was saying I 
killed somebody, you know, "My dad's gonna kill me if I do 
something wrong," you know, or --  
 
Q: I see. So when she said to you that O.J. was going to kill her, 
you took that as just a figure of speech and not seriously. Is that 
what you're trying to say? 
 
A: Hearing from her most -- yeah, right. Like, "Judy's gonna kill 
me if she finds out I'm smoking. Don't tell my mom," you know. 
 
Q: And she used that figure of speech in relation to O.J. Simpson, 
too, from time to time. Is that right?  
 
A: I never paid attention. To me it was like I saw her every day, so 
--  
 
Q: My question to you is: She said to you from time to time, 
"O.J.'s going to kill me." Is that true? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when she said that to you, you attached no significance to 
it? 
 
A: I never did, yeah. 
 
Q: You thought she didn't really mean what she was saying. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Is that right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And the reason you thought that is because she used this figure 
of speech all the time. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And she said that Judy was going to kill her. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And Faye was going to kill her. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And how many other people were going to kill her? What other 
people did she include in that when she used that figure of speech? 
 
A: Well, pretty much -- you know it's sort of like you don't pay 
attention to it, you know. 
 
Q: Can you remember any other names, Miss Fischman? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. You knew that Faye Resnick was in a treatment center at 
the night of Nicole's death. Right? 
 
MR. BAKER: Does she know that now? 
 
 
THE WITNESS: I didn't know at that time. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You know that now. Right?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Who told you about Nicole's use of cocaine? 
 
A: Faye told me.  
 
Q: Before or after Nicole's death?   
 
A: After Nicole's death. 
 
Q: So before Nicole's death you had no knowledge whatsoever of 
her using cocaine in the last months of her life. Is that right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And after Nicole's death Faye told you exactly what in 
that regard? 
 
A: That they were doing cocaine.  
 
Q: On what days? 
 
A: What days? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: She didn't specify. 
 
Q: So you had no idea from your conversation with Faye Resnick 
whether it was once or a hundred times. Right? Is that a fair 
statement? 
 
A: She said that they were free-basing, so I don't know what that 
means. 
 
Q: But you don't know how often. Correct? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And you don't know what quantities either. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: That's correct. Right? 
 
A: Yes, correct, I don't know what quantities. 
 
Q: And you don't know where the cocaine was obtained from. 
Correct? 
 
A: Yes, correct. 
 
Q: Okay. So other than Faye Resnick saying to you after Nicole's 
death that she and Nicole had been free-basing, you don't have any 
information whatsoever on Nicole's drug use prior to her death. Is 
that right? 
 
A: She said that when -- they were doing it when Nicole used to 
live on Gretna Green. 
 
Q: I am talking about the last couple of months. 
 
A: Oh. 
 
Q: You are also covering up your mouth with your hand, and it's 
hard to hear you. 
 
A: Oh, sorry. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Is there a question pending? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The answer is no. 
 
(Question read as follows: 
 
"Q. Okay. So other than Faye Resnick saying to you after Nicole's 
death that she and Nicole had been free-basing, you don't have any 
information whatsoever on Nicole's drug use prior to her death. Is 
that right?") 
 
THE WlTNESS: Prior to her death, yes, right. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And in fact you don't even know when Faye Resnick and Nicole 
were allegedly free-basing. Correct? 
 
A: I don't know when? 
 
Q: Correct. You don't know when. Right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Faye didn't tell you when they did that. Right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Okay. Have you learned from any other person besides Faye 
Resnick of any drug use by Nicole in the two months or three 
months before her death? 
 
A: Have I learned from? 
 
Q: (Nods head.) 
 
A: No. No. 
 
Q: And have you learned from any source other than Nicole and 
Faye any further information about her soliciting other men to have 
sex in the last few months of her life? 
 
MR. BAKER: Other than what she's testified to? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah. 
 
THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. Have I what? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Have you learned any other information on the topic of Nicole 
soliciting sex with men in the last few months of her life, other 
than what you've already told us? 
 
A: No. That's --  
 
Q: So have you now told us everything that you have heard or 
came to know on the topic of Nicole's drug use and Nicole's 
solicitation of men in the months leading up to her death? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
MR. KELLY: Why don't we take a break. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: One second. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Now let me get back to my -- to something you said earlier. We 
started out this line when I asked you whether anybody else 
entered your mind --  
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: -- in terms of who may have killed Nicole, and then you started 
talking about Faye Resnick and these topics. Okay? 
 
Was there a person who came to mind besides O.J. Simpson who 
you thought might have killed Nicole? 
 
A: Well, I thought it could be, because they were going out a lot, 
could be men they met when they went out, and because when 
Faye told me they were doing drugs. Again, I don't know whether 
this is public record}, and she didn't have any money, so I thought, 
okay, somebody could have been  --  you know, could be drugs. 
 
Q: Did any names come to mind? 
 
A: No, no names. 
 
Q: Okay. So you knew of no other person. Correct? 
 
MR. BAKER: Other than --  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Other than O.J. Simpson, who came into your mind as a person 
who might have killed Nicole. Is that right? 
 
A: No. No. 
 
Q: Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Okay. And I take it that you immediately communicated this 
information about Nicole's drug use and solicitation to the police 
so that they could track down possible people responsible for her 
death. Right? 
 
A: I -- yes. I told that to Marcia Clark.  
  
Q: When did you tell that to Marcia Clark? 
 
A: When she asked me. 
 
Q: Well, did you immediately pick up the phone and --  
 
A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. 
 
Q:  -- go to the police to tell them this information? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Well, you knew that O.J. Simpson was being charged with these 
crimes. Right? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: You saw it on television. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: In fact you were interviewed on 6-14, June 14th, 1994, by 
Officers LeFall and Luper. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you didn't tell them about -- any information about this 
drug or this solicitation information. Correct? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: You didn't tell them that. Is that right? 
 
MR. BAKER: She just answered your question. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember. I probably did. I probably did 
not. I mean --  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You probably did. You probably did not. What does that mean? 
 
A: I said I don't remember. 
 
Q: Did you tell them? Yes or no. 
 
MR. KRAMER: She has answered the question. 
 
THE WITNESS: I said I don't remember. 
 
MR. KRAMER: If you want to try to refresh her recollection, that's 
fine. She doesn't remember. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Okay. Did you tell Officer -- excuse me -- Detective Payne on 
June 24 about the drug use and the solicitation? 
 
A: You know, I don't even know what questions they asked me. I 
probably did. 
 
Q: So if they didn't ask you, you wouldn't have told them. Fair 
statement? 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Is that a fair statement? If they didn't ask you, you wouldn't 
have told them. 
 
A: They didn't ask me, so why would I give information. 
 
Q: So you didn't tell them. Is that right? 
 
MR. BAKER: If she recalls. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You said to me, "They didn't ask me" -- 
 
A: I don't remember. I mean --  
 
Q: -- "so why would I give them the information." 
 
So if they didn't ask you, you didn't give them the information. 
That's all I'm trying to find out. Is that --  
 
A: You know, when my girlfriend died, I didn't even know what 
was going on. There was a lot of confusion here. 
 
Q: I am not asking about your confusion. I am asking whether you 
told the police this important information that you've related to us 
in this deposition. 
 
MR. BAKER: And you've asked her that six times. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  
 
Q: You may answer. 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay. If they didn't ask you about this specifically, is it your 
testimony -- 
 
A: I probably did not. 
 
Q: Okay. That's all I'm trying to find out. You probably did not tell 
them. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. We can take a break now. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record, and the time 
is approximately 11:19. 
 
(Recess.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 11:37. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Have you spoken to any person other than Faye Resnick and 
other than [Name Deleted] concerning the alleged solicitation of 
men by Nicole? 
 
MR. BAKER: And Nicole? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: And Nicole. 
 
THE WITNESS: Have I? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Yes.  
 
A: It's just those three people, yes. 
 
Q: So you've spoken to no one else about that. Is that correct? 
 
A: Yes, correct. 
 
Q: At any time. Right? 
 
A: Correct, yeah. 
 
Q: And the same is true about the alleged drug use by Nicole in the 
last weeks and months of her --  
 
A: I mean, have I spoken to other people about that, you mean, or 
have I heard from other people? 
 
Q: Heard from other people. 
 
 
A: Oh, yes, only from the three of them. 
 
Q: Okay. And the same is true of the alleged drug use by Nicole in 
the last months of her life, that the only persons that you heard that 
from were from -- actually the only person you heard that from at 
all was Faye Resnick. Is that right?  
 
A: Yeah, Faye Resnick, right. 
 
Q: Okay. And since the early days after Nicole's death, you have 
heard  -- you have gained no further information on those topics. 
Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, who have you told about those incidents other than 
me at this deposition? 
 
A: Who have I told? 
 
Q: Have you told anyone else? 
 
MR. KRAMER: And you are not asking any questions with her 
attorneys.  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No. By "attorneys," I assume you mean Mr. 
Kramer or members of his law firm. 
 
MR. KRAMER: That's what I had in mind. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
THE WITNESS: I've told a lot of people. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Who have you told?  
 
A: A lot. 
 
Q: Name them.  
 
A: I told --  
 
Q: So that the question is clear, I am talking about the alleged drug 
use and the alleged solicitation of men. 
 
A: I told that to Cici, to...I told that to the Browns, to Judy --  
 
Q: Judy Brown? 
 
A: Yes. To -- I don't remember. It's pretty much the people I spoke 
to. I was trying to, you know --  
 
Q: Ron Fischman? 
 
A: Told that to Ron.  
 
Q: Anyone else? 
 
A: I think I mentioned that to Kato, too. 
 
Q: After Nicole's death?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Anyone else? 
 
A: Told that to Brooke Skulski, you know, when I was planning on 
writing a book. I told that to Mr. Kramer, to --   
 
MR. KRAMER: The conversations you had with me are 
privileged. 
 
THE WITNESS: Okay. To Jean Strauss, the book -- the lady I'm 
collaborating with. Told this to Michael Viner. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  
 
Q: Who is he? 
 
A: He's the one who wrote Faye's book. 
 
Q: He's an author? 
 
A: Not an author, but a publisher of Faye's book. 
 
That's it. I mean, I can't even remember names at this point. 
 
Q: Were your conversations with Jean Strauss tape-recorded? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: None of them?  
 
A: None at all. 
 
Q: When did you tell Michael Viner?  
 
A: This was after Faye Resnick wrote the book. 
 
MR. KELLY: I am sorry. I can't hear you, Miss Fischman. 
 
THE WITNESS: This is when Faye Resnick -- when her book 
came out.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And why were you telling this to the publisher of her book? 
 
A: Because I wanted to make a statement about the book. I want to 
-- I was very hurt by what she wrote about Nicole, and I thought I 
could make a statement in behalf of Nicole, who Nicole was to me, 
and I thought he could help me. 
 
Q: Make that statement?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How could he help you? 
 
A: Through an article in a newspaper or whatever. 
 
Q: You needed Michael Viner to get an article in a newspaper? 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Is that what you're saying?  
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't need Michael Viner, but Cici and Robin 
suggested that to me. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: So you told Michael Viner what -- this information about the 
solicitation and the drug use? Is that what you're saying? 
 
A: I -- yes. Yes. 
 
Q: And what did you ask him to do with that information? 
 
A: No. What happened was he taped it, and I told him how I felt 
about the whole thing. 
 
Q: He taped it? 
 
A: It was on tape when I made statement to Michael Viner. 
 
Q: I asked you about tape recordings before. You didn't mention 
this. Why is that? 
 
A: I didn't remember. 
 
Q: But after your break with your lawyer for about a half an hour, 
you suddenly remembered. Is that true? 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative.  
 
THE WITNESS: You know --  
 
MR. BAKER: Is this deposition --  
 
THE WITNESS: This is very  --  it's been like --  this has been for 
three years. I'm rehashing for a whole lot of years here and --  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Are you now saying to me that after the deposition  --  after the 
lengthy break and you met with your lawyer, you remembered the 
tape recording by Michael Viner? 
 
A: Well, because you had mentioned to me about the people who I 
told you about solicitation, and I'm trying to give you an honest 
answer. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you discuss this during the break? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Stop. Wait a minute. Stop. Stop. Stop. I don't 
mean to yell at you. I'm sorry. 
 
I meant to yell at you. 
 
MR.PETROCELLI: You don't have to yell. There is no point in 
yelling. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Dan, that's outrageous. 
 
MR.PETROCELLI: It's not outrageous. It's totally unprivileged. 
You tell the witness what to say; I'm completely at liberty to ask 
about that, and I intend to ask about that. 
 
MR. KRAMER: I instruct you to not answer any questions about 
the conversations you and I had. They are protected by the 
attorney-client communication privilege. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You talked to Mr. Baker at all today, Phil Baker? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever meet him before today? 
 
A: First time I meet him here. 
 
Q: Did you ever meet any of Mr. Simpson's lawyers in this case 
before today? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever talk to any of them?  
 
A: No. 
 
 
Q: Did you ever talk to O.J. Simpson?  
 
A: Have I ever talked to him? 
 
Q: Before today --  
 
A: Not before today. 
 
Q:  -- concerning your deposition.  
 
Q: Huh? 
 
A: Not -- no. 
 
Q: Today you talked to him? 
 
A: No, I didn't. I said hello to him today. 
 
Q: Did you talk to him about your deposition? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: At any time?  
 
A: At any time?  
 
Q: Yes, about the fact that you're coming here to testify. 
 
A: I told him Sunday that I'm gonna be --  my subpoena is on 
Tuesday. 
 
Q: What did he say? 
 
A: He just smiled. He says, "Good luck." 
 
Q: Okay. Was that the extent of the conversation: You said, "I'm 
coming Sunday," and he said, smiling, "Good luck," end of 
conversation?  
 
A: End of conversation.  
 
Q: Okay. Where did that occur?  
 
A: At his place. 
 
Q: You were there?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What were you doing there? 
 
A: My kids played with her -- with his kids this weekend. 
 
Q: I see. That's a common thing since he's been out of jail: Your 
kids go over there and play? 
 
A: Every other weekend. 
 
Q: So you're good friends with O.J. Simpson now. Right? 
 
A: We were good friends way before. As a family, we were. 
 
Q: Your friendship hasn't grown since Nicole's death. Is that with 
you're saying? 
 
A: Our friendship has not grown?  
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: We're still friends. 
 
Q: Has your friendship grown --   
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  -- since Nicole's death?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You now spend time with Mr. Simpson alone. Correct? 
 
A: I don't spend time with him alone. 
 
Q: At the time of Nicole's death, Nicole was primarily your friend, 
not O.J. Simpson. Is that true? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: Okay. How many times have you been in Mr. Simpson's 
company since his acquittal and release from jail? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Do you understand that question? 
 
THE WITNESS: How many times? 
 
MR. KRAMER: The "company," in his "company," what do you 
mean by that? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Do you understand the question? How many times have you 
been with him? 
 
A: With him?  
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: With the family, many times.  
 
Q: How many? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: October, November, December, January, February. We are now 
March 19th. So you have five and a half months. How many times 
have you been with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: Okay. Whenever the kids were around. 
 
 
Q: How many times? 
 
A: I don't remember. I can't count that. Whenever the kids were 
around. 
 
Q: Numerous times. Right?  
 
A: Numerous times. 
 
Q: And where have you been in his company? In his house, 
Rockingham? 
 
A: When I drop off kids, yes. 
 
Q: And you go and visit with him for a while at the house? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: At Rockingham, 360 North Rockingham?  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you've been in that house numerous occasions since Mr. 
Simpson's release from jail? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And have you spent any time with Mr. Simpson since his 
release from jail other than at 360 North Rockingham?  
 
A: Other than that? 
 
Q: Yes, at any other location, any other place.  
 
A: That's it.  
 
Q: Are you unsure?  
 
A: Well, I'm trying to remember.  
 
Q: Please, I want you to. 
 
A: When the kids went to Santa Barbara, I dropped off Leslie to 
Santa Barbara. 
 
Q: Did you visit with Mr. Simpson there? 
 
A: Mr. Simpson was there with his friends. 
 
Q: When was this? 
 
A: Before December. 
 
Q: Where in Santa Barbara? 
 
A: Santa Barbara. I don't remember, but it's in Santa Barbara. 
 
Q: Where did you drop them off in Santa Barbara? 
 
A: At his friends' house.  
 
Q: Who was the friend?  
 
A: [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: Who is [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: [Name Deleted] is O.J.'s friend. I met her the first time in Santa 
Barbara.  
 
Q: Where does she live? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: You dropped your children off?  
 
A: Yeah. Leslie. 
 
Q: For what reason? 
 
A: Because that's where Sydney was, and she wanted Nicole -- I 
mean Leslie to be there. 
 
Q: At the house of [Name Deleted]?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And that's where your children went? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did they go anyplace else?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And then they came back home?  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Okay. And did you visit with Mr. Simpson on that occasion? 
 
A: Did I visit him? 
 
Q: Yes, when you dropped off the children. 
 
A: Well, [Name Deleted] invited me to have dinner with them 
because --  
 
Q: So who was present at this dinner? What adults were present? 
 
MR. BAKER: You cut her off again. 
 
THE WITNESS: It was the [Name Deleted]s' family and me and 
O.J. and the kids. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I see. Did you come home that evening? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Where did you spend the night?  
 
A: Well, I spent it there with the [Name Deleted]s. 
 
Q: Okay. And where did Mr. Simpson spend the night? 
 
A: Mr. [Name Deleted] spent -- I mean Mr. Simpson spend it there, 
too. 
 
Q: So you and Mr. Simpson slept in the same house that evening. 
Is that right? 
 
MR. BAKER: Relevancy. 
 
THE WITNESS: He was in the guest house. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I didn't ask you if you slept with him, although I will in a 
moment. I am only asking you if you slept in the same house. 
 
A: Same house? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And how many times since his release from jail have you slept 
in the same house with O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: That's one time. That's in Santa Barbara. They didn't want me to 
go home because it was too far to pick up the kids. 
 
Q: You sound very defensive. I'm just asking you --  
 
A: You know what? Because --   
 
Q: Because why? 
 
A: Mr. Pet- --   
 
B: Petrocelli. 
 
A: I don't know your last name. Can't even pronounce it. 
 
Q: Petrocelli. Why are you defensive? 
 
A: Because of what the media has said yesterday. 
 
Q: What did they say yesterday? 
 
A: That I am having an affair with Mr. Simpson, and that's a lie. I 
see Mr. Simpson because of my kids. I will not deny my kids' 
friendship with his kids. 
 
Q: And because of the friendship --   
 
A: Sydney and Justin were Nicole's kids, and they've been friends 
with my kids since they were little, and I will continue to do that 
because Nicole and I said the same thing: We will take care of 
these kids no matter what.  
 
Q: Would you like to take a break?  
 
MR. KRAMER: Yeah, let's take a moment. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: This is the end of tape No. 1. The time is 
approximately 11:51, and we are off the record. 
 
(Recess.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are on the record. The time is 
approximately 11:54. This is the beginning of tape No. 2. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Now, before the break, Ms. Fischman, you made a statement 
that Nicole told you that you should take care of her kids no matter 
what. Is that right? Is that what Nicole said to you? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Meaning that if something should happen to her, she wanted 
you and your children to maintain a relationship with her children? 
Is that what she told you? 
 
A: Nicole and I made a pact of whatever happens between us, that 
we will take care of our kids. 
 
Q: And you would like to honor that pact. Is that what you're 
saying? 
 
A: Exactly. 
 
Q: And did Nicole tell you that if O.J. Simpson should kill her, she 
would like you to take care of her children? 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: Nicole never said that to me. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Nicole never uttered a word to you that O.J. Simpson might 
some day kill her. Is that what you're saying? 
 
A: Nicole never said that to me. 
 
Q: Did Nicole ever tell you that O.J. told her, "If I ever catch you 
with another woman, I'll kill you"? 
 
A: "If I ever catch you with another woman"? 
 
Q: Yes. Did Nicole ever relate to you that O.J. had said -- excuse 
me. Did Nicole ever relate to you that O.J. had said to her, "If I 
ever catch you with another man, I will kill you"? 
 
A: Nicole told me that, yes. 
 
Q: When did Nicole tell that you? 
 
A: When Nicole told O.J. about Marcus Allen. 
 
Q: And that's about the time that Nicole told you. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: That O.J. had said this. Right?  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Was that in 1993 when Nicole was living at Gretna Green? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Okay. And did Nicole ever tell you on any other occasions that 
O.J. said he might kill her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you report that statement to the police? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: Didn't pay attention. It's like I didn't --  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Excuse me. After Nicole's death did you report that statement to 
the police? 
 
A: After Nicole's...I probably did. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know of any person  -- prior to Nicole's death, do 
you know of any person who you think had it out to kill her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Other than the statement that O.J.  --  other than the statement 
Nicole made to you that O.J. Simpson said that he might kill her, 
did she ever tell you that anybody else might kill her?  
 
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered.  
 
THE WITNESS: Might kill her? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Yes. Or would kill her.  
 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So the only person that Nicole Simpson ever told you that might 
some day kill her is O.J. Simpson. True? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: Now getting back to the evening at the --  what's that family's 
name in Santa Barbara? I didn't write it down.  
 
A: [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: Excuse me?  
 
A: [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: [Name Deleted]. What is [Name Deleted]'s first name? 
 
A: [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: Is [Name Deleted] married?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What's her husband's name?  
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Had you ever met the [Name Deleted]s before this occasion? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Had you ever heard of them? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know how long O.J. Simpson has known the 
[Name Deleted]s?  
 
A: A long time. 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Long time. Now, the only occasion that you have slept in the 
same house with Mr. Simpson was at this place at the [Name 
Deleted]s' residence in Santa Monica? 
 
A: Could you rephrase that? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Santa Barbara? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Santa Barbara. Excuse me. 
 
Q: That's the only occasion when you and Mr. Simpson slept in the 
same house together since Nicole's death? 
 
MR. BAKER: I think she said there's a guest house also. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes, it's the first time.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did you and he sleep together?  
 
A: No 
 
Q: Have you ever had a sexual relationship with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever solicited such a relationship with him? 
 
A: Solicited? 
 
Q: Yes. Have you ever sought to have such --  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- a relationship with him?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: No? Never?  
 
A: Never. 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. Badgering a non-party witness. This 
is a deposition for ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT, not this 
litigation anymore, Dan. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Are you finished, Mr. Baker? 
 
MR. BAKER: Right now I am.  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
Q: Has he ever solicited an interest in having a sexual relationship 
with you?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever discussed it with each other? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Have you been out to dinner together at all? 
 
A: After when? After the verdict?  
 
Q: Nicole's death. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you eaten any --  
 
A: Oh, yes, yes. In Santa Barbara with the kids, we went to a 
Chinese restaurant. 
 
Q: Who went?  
 
A: Everybody.  
 
Q: You, Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: The [Name Deleted]s, [Name Deleted]s' kids, my kids, Sydney 
and Justin. 
 
Q: Okay. Is that the only time that you've had a meal with Mr. 
Simpson since his release from jail? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Have you had any meals at his house? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How many? 
 
A: I don't -- numerous times.  
 
Q: Since Nicole's death? 
 
A: Well, when the kids are there when I picked them up, I go to 
their kitchen, and then if there's food, I eat.  
 
Q: Okay. So you have a very friendly relationship right now. Is 
that right? 
 
A: I was friendly with the family, yes.  
 
Q: And you're still very friendly with Mr. Simpson. Right? 
Currently. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Your kids go there every other weekend? 
 
A: Most of the time, yes, whenever the kids are there. 
 
Q: And how long do they stay there?  
 
A: They stay there whenever Sydney is there. So from --  
 
Q: No. How long during the day?  
 
A: Oh, all day.  
 
Q: Both days?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: They sleep over?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you drop them off on Saturday? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when do you come get them? 
 
A: Sunday, Sunday night. 
 
Q: And do you spend lengthy periods of time there on Saturday 
and Sunday?  
 
A: Not really. I just drop them off, and then that's it. 
 
Q: Okay. Have you been to any parties with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: Parties? 
 
Q: Any social events, other than this event at the [Name Deleted]s' 
residence. 
 
MR. BAKER: After October 3rd? 
 
THE WITNESS: What do you mean  -- no. What do you mean, 
"parties"?  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Any events where there were people gathering socially at that 
time. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Super Bowl party. 
 
A: Well, you know, when he had friends, yes, I was there, yeah. 
 
Q: Why did you say no a couple minutes ago? 
 
A: Well, I don't know what you mean by "events." 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I said "party." You didn't know what I meant by "party" either? 
 
A: You see, his house --  
 
MR. BAKER: I am going to object as vague and ambiguous. 
"Party" can mean different things to different people. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I want to get the truth. Do you have any reason for not telling 
the truth here? 
 
A: I'm telling the truth, but I'm just getting confused with your 
questions, because when you ask me questions, when you say 
"gathering," their house is a lot of people there all the time. 
 
Q: I want to know everything. 
 
MR. BAKER: So is that a party to you? 
 
THE WlTNESS: Fine. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  
 
Q: Tell me --  
 
A: Do you consider that a party? If I -- 
 
Q: Tell me each time you've been to Rockingham since his 
acquittal and release from jail when there have been gatherings of 
people other than your children and his children. 
 
A: Whenever my kids were there, I go there, and, you know, that's 
it. I don't go there without my kids. Is that how you -- is that what 
you want? 
 
Q: No. 
 
A: That's it. 
 
Q: You went there for a Super Bowl party. Is that right? 
 
A: But my kids -- because my kids were there. 
 
Q: Okay. And who else was there? What adults were there? 
 
A: Oh, I don't remember. There were  -- I mean, there were -- 
everybody was there. 
 
Q: Who's "everybody"?  
 
A: His family. 
 
Q: What witnesses in this case were there? 
 
A: Witnesses in that case? 
 
Q: Yeah, what people who are involved as witnesses in this case? 
 
MR. BAKER: In the criminal case or the civil case? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Either one. 
 
MR.BAKER: Assuming she even knows. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember. I mean, I don't know most of 
the names. I mean, his family was there. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Just his family. No one else, no other friends? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Is that whet you're saying, just family? 
 
MR. KRAMER: You're asking about the --  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Super Bowl. 
 
MR. KRAMER: -- some function during the Super Bowl --  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Super Bowl.  
 
MR. KRAMER: -- this year? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Do you remember who was there, Cora? 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't even know if he had a Super Bowl party. 
He didn't even have any. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You told me he did. 
 
MR. BAKER: I think she said a gathering. 
 
THE WITNESS: It was -- see, what happens, I went to pick up the 
kids, and there were food outside so I ate. There's food, so that's it. 
I mean -- but I didn't sit down there and watch Super Bowl. I'm not 
even into Super Bowl. I don't think I -- my kids were there, yes, 
and I went to pick them up, so I ate because there was food there. 
They offered me -- her sister -- his sister offered me food, and I ate. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You're friends of the familUy? You're a friend of the --  
 
A: I'm not friends of the family. I mean, I know them. 
 
Q: You talk to them when you see them there? 
 
A: I talk to them when I see them. 
 
Q: Have you been to any parties at Mr. Simpson's house since his 
acquittal from jail? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Do you understand -- 
 
What do you mean by "parties"? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am not going to define that term. 
 
THE WITNESS: You know what? No.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Okay. Have you been to any sitdown dinners at his house? 
 
A: Yes.

exchanged kids.  
 
Q: Anyone else? 
 
A: I don't remember. Oh, and then Arnelle's friends. 
 
Q: Was Christian Reichardt there?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever seen Christian Reichardt at Mr. Simpson's house 
since Mr. Simpson was released from jail? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. And have you ever seen --  have you ever been in Mr. 
Reichardt's company since Mr. Simpson's release -- 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: -- from jail? When?  
 
A: I go for my back.  
 
Q: I see. So he treats you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What about on a social basis?  
 
A: I've had coffee with him, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. On how many occasions?  
 
A: Numerous occasions. 
 
Q: Just you and he alone?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Anyone else ever present?  
 
A: Anyone ever present? No.  
 
Q: No. Okay. Now, other than the Christmas Day party, did you 
attend any other parties at Mr. Simpson's residence since his 
release from jail? 
 
MR. BAKER: We've got to get a definition of "party." 
 
THE WITNESS: No more. That's it. I told you that's one time, that 
the Christmas Day. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Okay. And have you been at any other social events at Mr. 
Simpson's residence since his release from jail?  
 
MR. KRAMER: Do you understand what that term is? 
 
THE WITNESS: Social events? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Yeah.  
 
A: No.

release from jail?  
 
A: No  
 
Q: Have you given him any gifts?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. And you've never traveled anywhere with him since his -
-  
 
A: No.

with Mr. Simpson since his release from jail about this case? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: About this deposition? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: About your testimony?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: About your knowledge of the facts?

Q: Okay. How many such conversations have you had? 
 
A: I don't remember. I don't remember. 
 
Q: By the way, were you at Mr. Simpson's house the day of his 
acquittal?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. When is the first time you saw Mr. Simpson after his 
release from jail? 
 
A: I would say a week or two weeks after. 
 
Q: And who contacted whom?  
 
A: His housekeeper called. 
 
Q: Who is his housekeeper?  
 
A: Gigi. 
 
Q: What did she call for? 
 
A: She said that "Mr. Simpson is here." I said, "Okay," and I asked 
him how he's doing, and I said, "Where are the kids? When are we 
going to see the kids?" So... 
 
Q: If you thought Mr. Simpson were guilty, would you let your 
children visit his children at his house? 
 
A: If I thought he was guilty? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: You said you had a pact with Nicole. Would you honor that 
pact if Mr. Simpson were guilty or found guilty? 
 
A: I probably would. Because our kids come first. 
 
Q: Tell me about your conversations with Mr. Simpson concerning 
your knowledge of the facts and this lawsuit. 
 
MR. KRAMER: In this lawsuit? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah. 
 
MR. KRAMER: The civil case? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: (Nods head.) 
 
Q: Relate them to me. 
 
A: We always talk about Nicole, you know. We try to relive 
Nicole. That's all. 
 
Q: What does he say? 
 
A: I don't remember. I mean, it's...  
 
Q: You don't remember? 
 
A: Well, we always talked about Nicole, what happened, what -- 
you know, this whole thing. I mean, it's like reliving the whole 
thing, reliving two years of their life. 
 
Q: So you and he have long conversations about the last couple of 
years of Nicole's life? Is that what you're saying? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Why do you have those conversations? 
 
A: Because part I'm trying to understand what really happened. 
 
Q: And do you have a better understanding now that you've had a 
chance to talk to Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: Well, but he talked to me even before, when Nicole was alive. I 
mean, he called me every time there was --  they had a problem. 
 
Q: Excuse me. You said that "I'm trying to understand what really 
happened." 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And now that you've had a chance to talk to Mr. Simpson 
numerous occasions at length about what really happened, do you 
now have a better understanding? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  
 
Q: You don't? 
 
A: I don't think I'll ever find out the answer. 
 
Q: The answer to what really happened? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: What do you mean by "what really happened"? Why she was 
killed and how she was killed? 
 
A: Exactly. 
 
Q: So you and Mr. Simpson spend long hours talking about that? 
 
A: I did not say "long hours." 
 
Q: Many conversations. Right? 
 
A: I was -- not many conversations. I mean, we always -- we talk 
about kids, too. I mean, I don't know how to say this. This is like 
when you talk --  
 
MR. KRAMER: Slow down and regroup your thoughts and say it 
as best as you can. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Has Mr. Simpson told you how Nicole was killed? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Does he -- has he told you how he believes she was killed? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Has he offered to you a single suggestion or idea about how she 
was killed? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Has he ever identified to you a single person that he thinks is 
responsible for killing Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Are you aware of anything Mr. Simpson has done to 
locate the so-called real killer or killers? 
 
A: Have you what? 
 
Q: Have you talked to Mr. Simpson about anything that he has 
done to locate the so-called real killer or killers? 
 
A: Yeah, he told me. 
 
Q: What did he tell you? 
 
A: That he's got investigators. 
 
Q: And what has he told you about that? 
 
A: That's it. I didn't ask him any more questions. 
 
Q: You asked him, "What are you doing, O.J., to find the killer or 
killers?" 
 
A: Exactly. 
 
Q: When did you ask him that? 
 
A: The first time I saw him after the verdict, you know, weeks after 
the verdict. 
 
Q: And what did he say to you? "I've got investigators"?

Q: Did he tell you who the investigators were? 
 
A: No, he didn't tell me. 
 
Q: Did he ask you to sit down and meet with his investigators to 
provide them information to assist them in their investigation?

Q: Have you ever met with his investigators? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you even know who they are?  
 
A: I don't know them. 
 
Q: Do you know a single thing these investigators have done?

THE WITNESS: I don't know.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You've never been contacted by them? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever asked to meet the investigators so you could help 
find the real killer or killers? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Are you interested in finding the real killer or killers? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What have you done in that regard? 
 
A: Nothing.  
 
Q: Why? 
 
A: Because I'm out of energy. Okay?  
 
Q: Do you have any plans --  
 
A: I have a family. 
 
Q: Do you have any plans to do anything? 
 
MR. BAKER: You're cutting her off. 
 
THE WITNESS: Do I have any plans?  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: I don't have the money to do it. 
 
Q: Mr. Simpson does, though. Right?  
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Have you asked him that?  
 
A: No. 
 
 
Q: Have you been approached by any of Mr. Simpson's lawyers in 
this case about your knowledge or information?

Questions like the ones I'm asking you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And you gave him the answers. Right? 
 
A: No. He didn't ask me questions. He asked me what I think -- 
what --  Gave you the answers, yes. 
 
Q: You gave him the answers. Right?  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And then he would discuss with you your answers. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: He would follow up on your answers. Right? 
 
A: He would ask -- yes.

Q: (Nods head.)  
 
A: About Nicole.

use?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. So that's another person that you've told, then. Right? 
 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Does that bring to mind anyone else you may have told 
that to? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay. What else did you and Mr. Leonard talk about? 
 
A: If -- I don't remember. Just the same thing as what you were 
telling me -- you were asking me. 
 
Q: He would ask you the same questions I'm asking you? 
 
A: Pretty much, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And you answered them. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Were you under oath at that time, do you know?

MR. KRAMER: Is that a yes?  
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Were these friends of Nicole, do you know? 
 
A: Yes.

A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. I mentioned to you the Harouch family. Do you know 
who they are? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. How long was your meeting with Mr. Shapiro? 
 
A: Like half an hour. 
 
Q: Is that the only time you met with any of Mr. Simpson's 
lawyers? 
 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What about any investigators of Mr. Simpson or his lawyers? 
Did you meet with any of them or talk with any of them? 
 
A: I don't remember. I mean, I was talking to a lot of investigators 
before. I mean... 
 
Q: You don't remember?  
 
A: No, I don't remember.  
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: I'm sorry. 
 
Q: You talked about an interview or a discussion with Michael 
Viner. Do you recall that? a tape recording? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you have that tape recording?  
 
A: Oh, no, I don't have that tape. 
 
Q: Have you ever seen a transcription of it? 
 
A: No, but it showed  --  yeah, it showed in the newspaper. 
 
Q: It was in the newspapers?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And do you know if -- do you know why Mr. Viner recorded 
his conversation with you? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did you ask him to? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Why? 
 
A: Because he wanted to record at that time -- I don't know. He 
recorded it because, I guess, to meet with magazine or whatever. 
 
Q: So you and he had a private meeting, it was tape-recorded, and 
he was going to take this recording and give it to or show it to or 
play it to other people? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And where did you and he meet? 
 
A: At his office. 
 
Q: And how long? 
 
A: I don't remember. An hour, two hours. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, you told me that originally the purpose of this was 
to respond to Faye's book. Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: So what did you and Mr. Viner talk about for two hours? 
 
A: Well, it's about Nicole and different --  the men in her life. 
Pretty much it's the same thing as I told you.  
 
Q: What was your point in talking about those issues? You said 
that the point of this was --  
 
A: Because he asked me questions. 
 
Q:  -- to respond to Faye's book and the unfair portrayal of Nicole 
in that book. 
 
A: Because he asked me questions and I answered them. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you authorize him to issue a statement to the press 
responding on your behalf? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
A: Because I guess he didn't like what I have to say about Faye 
Resnick, so...  
 
Q: Is that what he told you? 
 
A: That's what Robin told me and Cici told me. 
 
Q: Well, did you then on your own without Mr. Viner respond to 
Faye Resnick's book? 
 
A: I did not respond at all. I mean, it didn't come out, so... 
 
 
Q: What didn't come out? 
 
A: Whatever statement I made.  
 
Q: Why not? 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I'm a little confused. You're telling me that you went to Mr. 
Viner's so you could respond to Resnick's book. He didn't want to 
participate because you were critical of Resnick. Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you then did nothing more about it? 
 
A: Nothing, because he said to me nobody --  that there were no 
offers. 
 
Q: Offers for what? 
 
A: To write the article, what I said, the statement I made. 
 
Q: You mean you were looking for money? 
 
A: I was not looking for money, okay -- 
 
Q: This was for money, you mean? You were going to make a 
response for money. Is that what you're saying? 
 
A: No, I did not do it for money. 
 
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: I said to Mr. Viner, "I would like to make a 
statement about my friend," okay. 
 
And he said, you know, "What do you have to say?" That's it. And 
then he told me, he says, you know, "You can make money out of 
this."  
 
I said, "I don't care. I just want to make a statement about my 
girlfriend. I want to correct what Faye Resnick said." 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: But you never made that statement. 
 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And because nobody would take the statement from you. Is that 
what you're saying? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you try --  
 
A: This is what he told me. 
 
Q: Did you try to give the statement to anyone? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you call anybody up and say, "I have some information I 
would like to release to you," any member of the media? Did you 
do that? 
 
A: I didn't want to talk to the media anymore. I was like -- I 
thought this guy was a good guy. 
 
Q: Who? 
 
A: Mr. Viner. 
 
Q: Now, did anybody ever learn about your conversation with Mr. 
Viner? 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Did anyone? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Yeah. Did you ever tell anyone about it? 
 
A: God, here we go again. I told probably the same group of 
people now. 
 
Q: Okay. Where did you and Mr. Viner meet again? 
 
A: At his office.  
 
Q: Just the two of you? 
 
A: With two other guys from --  a reporter --  two reporters. I don't 
remember. 
 
Q: So now there's two other people at the meeting with you and 
Mr. Viner? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And who are these people? 
 
A: I don't remember. They were two guys from tabloids. 
 
Q: So your meeting with Mr. Viner was with members of the 
tabloids? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So you wanted to make a statement to the tabloids? 
 
A: No. He suggested to me to talk to tabloid to get a -- for 
everybody to hear. He said the tabloid is what people see right 
away, and that's why. 
 
Q: And you agreed to do that? 
 
A: I was confused. Okay? I didn't know what was going on. I was 
just trying to see what would be the best place for me to even talk 
to --  
 
Q: It had nothing to do with your desire to investigate the 
exploitation of your story for money. Is that right? 
 
MR. BAKER: You interrupted her last answer. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Is that right? 
 
MR. BAKER: It's argumentative this question. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Is that your testimony, that your sitting now with Mr. Viner and 
two members from a tabloid to tell your story had nothing to do 
with your desire to make money? 
 
A: No, I had no desire to make money. 
 
Q: No concern whatsoever. 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: I just wanted to correct -- I didn't know, but this 
is what Cici told me. Cici told me, "If you need to speak, go to 
Michael Viner. He will help you." 
 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did you give the tabloids permission to use the story? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
A: I did not give them permission.  
 
Q: Why not? 
 
A: Why? 
 
Q: Did they tell you they were unwilling to write the story? 
 
A: Because Michael -- I don't know. I don't know. 
 
Q: Because why? 
 
A: I don't know. Because probably Michael Viner didn't want to 
bring it out. 
 
Q: It was your story, not Michael Viner's. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, in truth, you told those members of the tabloid that they 
didn't have permission to write this story. Correct?  
 
A: Correct.  
 
Q: That's the truth.  
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And the truth is, had you given them permission, they would 
have written it. Correct? 
 
MR. KRAMER: If you know. 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation and argumentative. 
 
MR. KRAMER: If you know.  
 
THE WITNESS: What?  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  
 
Q: If you had given them permission to use the story, they would 
have used it, and they told you so. Correct? 
 
A: If I gave them permission?  
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: I didn't give them permission. 
 
Q: Had you given them permission, they would have used the 
story. Correct? 
 
MR. KRAMER: If you know.  
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes, probably.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: So your statement before that no one was willing to take the 
statement was false. Correct? 
 
A: What? I didn't -- I'm lost. 
 
Q: Your testimony just a few minuses ago that nobody was 
prepared to take your statement was false -- 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative --  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  
 
Q: -- correct? 
 
MR. BAKER: --  mischaracterizes her testimony. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You gave false testimony in this deposition just a few minutes 
ago. Isn't that true? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Stop bullying her.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Answer the question, please. 
 
A: I'm lost. My mind is out now. I mean, would you mind 
repeating --  
 
Q: You gave false testimony in this deposition just a few moments 
ago --  
 
A: That's not true. 
 
Q:  -- correct? 
 
A: That's not true. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Let her answer. 
 
THE WITNESS: That's not true. 
 
MR. BAKER: You are harassing this witness. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You knew that these reporters would write the story and they 
would publish it and they would put it on the front page of the 
National Enquirer --  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q:  -- had you given them permission to do so. Correct? 
 
A: They didn't have any permission because they signed a non-
disclosure agreement. 
 
Q: So this had nothing to do with your wanting to respond to Faye 
Resnick in the interest of public information for your friend Nicole. 
This had to do with money. Correct? 
 
A: No, this had nothing to do with money. 
 
That's wrong. That's wrong. 
 
Q: And you weren't being truthful in this deposition when I asked 
you about this earlier. Correct? 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative, harassing, asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: That's wrong.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: What's wrong? 
 
A: That you're saying that I was after money to make a statement 
on behalf. At that time I didn't know that these were tabloids. Cici 
told me to go to Michael Viner. 
 
Q: Excuse me. Are you trying to tell me that you did not know that 
the people in the room with you were from a tabloid, specifically 
the National Enquirer? Is that what you're saying? 
 
A: Because Michael Viner told me that "You can express your 
statement about Nicole through these people." 
 
I said, "No, I really don't want to do it," okay. 
 
"But this is the only place you could do it." 
 
I said, "No, I'd rather do it for a different magazine." 
 
So that's it. And so these guys were there, and that was it, but --  
 
Q: You knew --  
 
A:  -- we didn't talk about money. 
 
Q: You knew they were from the National Enquirer. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Okay. And you knew that they were interested in getting your 
story. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And you knew that they would get your story with only your 
permission. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And you knew that they were willing to pay you. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. We'll take a break now.

EXAMINATION (Resumed) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: We were talking about your attempt to clear Nicole's name in 
response to the Faye Resnick book. Do you recall that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And in order to clear Nicole's name, you met with Michael 
Viner and the National Enquirer, and you've talked about that 
meeting. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Now, what ever happened after that meeting with the National 
Enquirer? 
 
A: Nothing happened. 
 
Q: Did you talk to them? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you have any further conversations? 
 
A: I told Michael Viner I didn't want the National -- I didn't want a 
tabloid to do it. I said I'd rather do something through a decent 
magazine, but not National Enquirer. 
 
Q: You didn't mention that to me before the break. Is that 
something --  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: --  you discussed during the break? 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. 
 
MR. KRAMER: You are not going to talk about anything that you 
had conversations with me, attorney-client communication. 
 
THE WITNESS: Okay. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Something you just remembered over lunch? 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. 
 
 
THE WITNESS: No. You explained  -- you asked me the question 
clearly, so --  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Well, Miss Fischman, at the time you sat down with the 
National Enquirer, you knew that the representatives there were 
from the National Enquirer. Correct? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: But you agreed to talk on the condition that they pay you if they 
used --  
 
A: No, there was no --  
 
Q:  -- the story. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Let him finish his question, and then you can 
answer. Okay? 
 
THE WITNESS: Okay. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You agreed to talk to the National Enquirer. In other words, you 
didn't get up and storm out of the room and say, "I'm not talking to 
the tabloids." Correct? Is that correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Okay. And you agreed to talk to the National Enquirer on the 
condition that if they used the story, they were going to have to pay 
you. Right? 
 
A: There was no payment discussed.  
 
Q: No, but they were going to have to pay you. 
 
A: Michael Viner said they are going to pay me. 
 
Q: And you agreed with that. Right?  
 
A: I did not agree on anything. 
 
Q: Did you object to Mr. Viner's statement to that effect? 
 
A: Mr. Viner told me, "Okay, we'll see what you have to say." 
 
Q: Did you object when Mr. Viner said that they will have to pay 
you? Yes or no. 
 
MR. BAKER: Harassing. You don't have... 
 
THE WITNESS: I did not object. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Okay. By the way, have you seen a transcript of that tape 
recording? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you heard the tape?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Ever? 
 
A: Ever. 
 
Q: Ever talked to Mr. Viner about it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When was the last time you've spoken with Mr. Viner? 
 
A: That was the last time. That was after -- after that tape I told -- 
after that discussion I had with him, I told him, "I don't want to do 
it. I don't want to do a tabloid. I'd rather do it with a magazine," or 
something like that. 
 
Q: And did you thereafter? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So you did nothing to clear Nicole's name. Correct? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Is that correct?  
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Okay. And you thought that telling the National Enquirer about 
the solicitation of men by Nicole and free-basing by Nicole would 
somehow serve to clear her name? 
 
MR. BAKER: Objection. Asked and answered. 
 
THE WlTNESS: Michael Viner asked me those questions, okay, so 
I answered them. 
 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You could have refused to answer. Right? 
 
A: I could have. 
 
Q: But you didn't. Right? 
 
A: I did not. 
 
Q: Okay. So this is all Michael Viner's fault. He forced --  
 
A: No, it's not Michael Viner's fault.  
 
Q: --  you to talk. It was your decision. Right? 
 
A: No, it's not Michael Viner's fault. 
 
Q: It was your choice to talk, not Michael Viner's. Right? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Let him fmish his question, and then think about 
it and make your answer. Okay? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: It was your choice to talk, not Michael Viner's. Right? 
 
A: Of course it was my choice to talk. 
 
Q: He didn't have a gun to your head. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Are you looking for a book publisher right now? 
 
A: Am I looking for a book publisher? 
 
Q: (Nods head.)  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Is someone looking for a publisher on your behalf? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Who? 
 
A: Mr. John Taylor Williams. 
 
Q: Okay. What is the subject of your book? 
 
A: It's about my reladonship with Nicole. 
 
Q: What material -- source material do you have in writing for that 
book? Any? 
 
A: Source in writing?  
 
Q: Source material. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Do you understand what that is? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Source material is documentation, papers, pictures, anything 
you might refer to to help write your book. 
 
Do you have any such source material? 
 
A: I don't have it. 
 
Q: Are you going to be getting some from anyone? 
 
A: Probably. 
 
Q: From whom? 
 
A: Miss Jean Strauss. 
 
Q: Where is Jean Strauss going to get it? 
 
A: What? 
 
Q: Where is Jean Strauss going to get the source material? 
 
A: Well, she's the one -- I'm collaborating the book with her. 
 
MR. KRAMER: I don't think the witness understands "source 
material." 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: What I am trying to find out is whether you have in your 
possession or have access to obtaining any papers, any writings, 
any photographs, any materials from which you will then use to 
write your book. 
 
A: I do, yes. 
 
Q: Where are those? 
 
A: I have -- Miss Strauss has it. 
 
Q: What does Miss Strauss have? 
 
A: Pictures. 
 
Q: What else does Miss Strauss have? 
 
A: Well, information about myself and Nicole. 
 
Q: Besides photographs -- you mean photographs when you said 
"Pictures"? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: You have to answer audibly. 
 
A: Yes. Yes. 
 
Q: Does she have anything else in terms of pieces of paper that you 
gave her? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Could you perhaps give Miss Fischman some 
ideas --  some examples of source materials so that she can answer 
your question? 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't have any. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did you give Miss Strauss anything other than photographs? 
 
A: No, I didn't give her -- it's just photographs. 
 
Q: You just gave her photographs. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What photographs did you give her? 
 
A: Photographs of the kids. 
 
Q: Whose children? 
 
A: My children and Sydney and Justin. 
 
Q: Any other photographs? 
 
A: My photograph with her -- I mean my birthday party in 1993, 
the Christmas pictures that we had in '93. 
 
Q: Any videotapes? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Can you bring those photographs tomorrow? 
 
A: Okay, yes. 
 
MR. KRAMER: I actually have, at your request of my associate, 
the negatives and the pictures in connection with the National 
Enquirer lawsuit. I didn't know when to give those to you, but I 
have those here. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Please give them to me now. 
 
Q: While we're waiting for those pictures, on the National 
Enquirer, when did you discover  --  the lawsuit, when did you 
discover that the photograph was missing? 
 
A: When? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Around that time when it came out in October. 
 
Q: Is it one photograph? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, your lawyer has handed me four photographs. They 
all bear a date at the bottom of December 22, 1993. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You want to pass those around to the other 
lawyers? 
 
Q: While they are looking at those photographs, are these 
photographs that you took? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
 
Q: And was one of these photographs the one taken by the -- by 
this person that's the subject of your lawsuit? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You will identify that one for us? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Why is it that you are bringing a lawsuit against the Enquirer 
over one photograph? 
 
MR. BAKER: Irrelevant. 
 
THE WITNESS: Why? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Because at that time when I was collaborating a book with 
Brooke Skulski, Brooke told me that they need pictures for this 
Christmas story. And so I have those pictures, and then when they 
wanted to use the family picture on front page, they said, "You 
know, the Star won't put that on front page because National 
Enquirer said they own the copyright." 
 
And so that's when I said, "You know, they don't own the 
copyright." 
 
So Brooke said -- I thought she was my friend. She said, "You 
know, Cora, they said you could sue them. They don't care. You 
can sue them and" -- and, you know, "and that's the only thing you 
can do," but they weren't gonna stop, and print that picture anyway.  
 
Q: What Christmas story are you referring to? 
 
A: The Christmas story of 1993, and it was published in 1994. 
 
Q: By? 
 
A: By Star. It was written by Brooke Skulski. 
 
Q: I see. And you provided Brooke with photographs for that Star 
Magazine --  
 
A: Exactly. 
 
Q: -- story? And that's the story for which you were paid the 
money? 
 
A: Right. 
 
 
Q: Okay. And did you clear Nicole's name in that story? 
 
A: Pretty much it was a good story about the family. It was -- there 
was nothing negative, because I told Brooke, "I don't want 
anything"  --  I mean, I wanted her pictured as a mom and just, you 
know, things that we did. 
 
Q: You have to speak up. How did the National Enquirer get this 
photograph? 
 
A: How? 
 
Q: Yeah. Did you give it to them --  
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  -- originally?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you give Mr. Viner any photographs when you met with the 
National Enquirer? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, when you've had your many conversations with O.J. 
Simpson, since he got out of jail, about this case, have he and you 
discussed this topic of solicitation of men by Nicole?  
 
MR. BAKER: I am going to object to the term "many." 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  
 
Q: You may answer. 
 
A: Yes, I mentioned to him. 
 
Q: And he has discussed it with you?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What do you mean, "No"? He's never discussed it with you? 
 
A: No. Well, I told him, and he was shocked, couldn't believe it. 
 
Q: Couldn't believe that Nicole did such a thing? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And did you tell him about the free-basing? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And what was his reaction to that? 
 
A: Well, he was shocked, because he said, "That's not the Nicole 
that I knew," you know, "Nicole was different." 
 
Q: Now, Mr. Simpson told you to say these things at this 
deposition about solicitation of men --  
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  --  by Nicole and free-basing of drugs, didn't he?  
 
A: Who? If O.J.?  
 
Q: Mr. Simpson told you to say these things. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You and he discussed that you would bring this out at this 
deposition. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You deny that? You deny that, ever talking with Mr. Simpson 
that you would be testifying about these topics today? 
 
A: What do you mean, I "deny"? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Do you understand the question? 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
MR. KRAMER: He's asking -- You might want to rephrase it.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Do you deny that you and Mr. Simpson have discussed that you 
would be talking about those topics at this deposition? 
 
A: If I deny it? I -- see, you're just asking me questions, so I'm 
answering you. I mentioned to Mr. Simpson about what these 
things with Nicole but he didn't tell me to tell you. 
 
Q: Did you talk about the fact that you would be testifying about 
these things 
 
at the deposition? 
 
A: No, we never talked about what would come out here. 
 
Q: Okay. When did you first tell Mr. Simpson about the 
solicitation of men by Nicole and free-basing? 
 
A: After the -- you know, when I saw him after the verdict, like a 
week, two weeks after, I was crying, I was teling him what 
happened, you know, what was Nicole doing, and he was shocked. 
He was crying, you know, so... 
 
Q: You never told him on the telephone in your conversations? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
MR. KRAMER: What telephone conversations? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You spoke to him on the phone a number of times when he was 
in jail?  
 
A: A number of times? 
 
Q: Correct. 
 
A: Not a number of times. Twice. 
 
Q: Did you tell him on those two occasion?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Didn't you think it was important for him to know to defend 
himself in the criminal case? 
 
A: I never -- I never volunteered information. He never asked me, 
and I never gave it to him, you know. 
 
Q: But you volunteered it when he got out of jail, didn't you? 
 
A: Well, because it was already all over the media, it was all over 
the press, and that's why I told him. 
 
Q: What was in the press? 
 
A: About this solicitation and the free-basing and stuff. 
 
 
Q: And when did that come out in the press? 
 
A: Faye Resnick's book. 
 
Q: That was a year before Mr. Simpson's release from jail that it 
came out in the press. Right? 
 
A: It was also in the tabloid --   
 
Q: Okay. Now, during --  
 
A: -- that they were doing cocaine and... 
 
Q: During that year after it came out, did you ever discuss it with 
Mr. Simpson on the telephone? 
 
A: I never discuss it with him over the phone. 
 
Q: What did you discuss with him over the phone? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: No recollection at all? 
 
A: Well, I was crying. I mean, I don't remember. I was grieving for 
Nicole.  
 
Q: You don't recall what you and O.J. discussed? 
 
A: He was crying, too. He was crying.  
 
Q: So what did you talk about? 
 
A: We talked about Nicole. 
 
Q: What did he want to know? 
 
A: He missed Nicole, and we're trying to -- I don't know. We were 
grieving for Nicole. 
 
Q: On the telephone together. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did he ask you any questions about her activities during the last 
weeks and months of her life? 
 
MR. KRAMER: This is again just the telephone conversations that 
they had --  
 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: While he was in jail, right. 
 
THE WITNESS: You know, I don't remember. I mean... 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You have no recollection? 
 
A: We were crying about Nicole, what really happened, and stuff 
like that. 
 
Q: You have no recollection of his inquiring about her activities. Is 
that your testimony? 
 
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: If he asked me, you mean? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  
 
Q: (Nods head.) 
 
A: He did ask me a few things. 
 
Q: What did he ask you? 
 
A: "What happened to Nicole?" 
 
Q: What did you say? 
 
A: I said, "I don't know. I mean, you know, I said, "The last six 
weeks she was different." 
 
Q: And what else did he ask you? 
 
A: And he says, you know, "She want to go back. She doesn't want 
to go back." And he said, "I wanted to move on with my life. You 
know, I'm back with Paula. What's going on here?" 
 
MR. KRAMER: Is this all the same time frame? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Are you telling us this is what Mr. Simpson told you on the 
telephone? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: That he's back with Paula, "What's going on here?" That's what 
he said? 
 
A: You know, it was so confusing. When you're grieving for a 
friend and you're trying to understand, I mean it's -- and that's what 
happened. 
 
Q: Is that what he said to you, that he was back with Paula? 
 
A: He was back with Paula, yes. 
 
Q: And what did he say about Nicole that you were telling me 
about a few moments ago? First she wants to go back; then she 
doesn't want to go back? What did he say about that subject? 
 
A: He says, "What does Nicole want?" you know. "She calls me. 
She says, `I want my family back,'and then when I'm -- you know, 
"and then she changes her mind. She says, `You know, O.J., I'm 
not ready. I'm confused.'" 
 
MR. KRAMER: I think the witness has a different time frame. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You are relating conversations that you had with Mr. Simpson 
while he was in jail. Is that right? 
 
A: Yeah, things like that, yeah. 
 
Q: And he was talking to you about the fact that Nicole kept 
changing her mind about her desire to have a relationship with Mr. 
Simpson? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you knew all about that, of course, from your own private 
conversations with Nicole. Right? 
 
A: I guess, yes. 
 
Q: And what did you say to Mr. Simpson when he said that to you? 
 
A: I don't remember. I was crying. I mean, it was -- we were just 
crying.  
 
Q: Now, when they broke up for the last time, it was Nicole who 
ended the relationship. Right? 
 
A: It was pretty much both of them.  
 
Q: Now, you have previously told others that it was Nicole who 
ended it and she ended it in Cabo, and she told you when she came 
back that she ended the relationship. Is that true?  
 
A: She didn't end it in Cabo. 
 
Q: She told you she was going to end the relationship. Is that true? 
 
A: That she was planning to, yes.  
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So Nicole told you she was planning to end the relationship. 
Correct?  
 
A: Right. Correct. 
 
Q: And she told that you when she came back from Cabo in April 
of 1994. Correct? 
 
A: It has -- it's not after that. It's probably weeks after that. I'm not 
sure, but --  
 
Q: After she came back from Cabo, sometime afterwards. 
 
A: That's what she said, yes. 
 
Q: You were not in Cabo with Nicole -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  -- on that trip. Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Faye Resnick was with her and the Jenners -- or Kris Jenner. 
Correct? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Christian Reichardt?  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Mr. Simpson?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when she came back, she told you that she planned to end 
the relationship. Correct? 
 
A: No, she didn't say that. She said she had a great time in Cabo, 
and she had the best time in Cabo, but then -- with O.J.  
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
 
A: And then she started going out with Faye, and then that's the 
week when she started saying, "I'm not going to Puerto Rico. I'm 
going to stay here." 
 
Q: When did she tell you that she was going to end the relationship 
with O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: She didn't say she wanted to end. She said that she was early in 
trying to go back to O.J. and that she wanted another year of 
herself without O.J.  
 
Q: You previously testified just a few moments ago that she told 
you that she was planning to end the relationship with O.J. 
Simpson. 
 
Do you want me to read that back to you? 
 
A: You just read it to me. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, she told you that. Correct? 
 
A: To my recollection she said it, but she was not sure as to when 
she wanted to end it. 
 
Q: When did she tell you that? That's what I'm asking you.  
 
A: I don't remember.  
 
Q: It was sometime when she came back from Cabo. Correct?  
 
A: You're telling me that. 
 
Q: No. I'm asking you that.  
 
A: Oh, you're asking me. 
 
Q: I'm asking. Did she tell you that she planned to end the 
relationship at some time when she came back from Cabo? 
 
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered.  
 
THE WITNESS: Not after her Cabo trip, but after that. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: When? What month? 
 
A: When was the Cabo trip? 
 
Q: April, middle of April 1994. 
 
 
MR. SIMPSON: That's incorrect. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Simpson wants to testify again. He says -
-  
 
MR. BAKER: So do you. 
 
THE WITNESS: She said it around --   
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I'll be happy to swear him in again. In fact, I 
plan to do that. 
 
MR. BAKER: Is that right? 
 
MR. BREWER: Day ll, held hostage.  
 
THE WITNESS: After  --  See, now you distracted me. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Hold on. Hold on second. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I'm sorry, Miss Fischman. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Just regroup your thoughts, focus on --  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I am asking you to give me your best estimate as to the time 
when Nicole Brown Simpson told you that she planned --  
 
A: I'm trying. 
 
Q:  -- to end her relationship with O.J. Simpson. 
 
That's the question.  
 
A: Okay. 
 
MR. KRAMER: So that I'm sure it's clear, you want to know not 
when the timing that it would end, but when the conversation took 
place. Is that right? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I've been asking that about 30 times. It's 
crystal clear.  
 
MR. KRAMER: Well, it's crystal clear to you. You're asking --  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It's crystal clear to anyone listening. 
 
 
MR. BAKER: Not me. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Almost everyone. 
 
MR. KELLY: You don't count, Phil. 
 
THE WITNESS: I will tell you a story. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I really just want you to answer the question. Then you can tell 
me the story. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Do you have the question in mind? 
 
THE WlTNESS: It's probably two weeks after Cabo trip. 
  
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Okay. Now, what's the story you want to tell? 
 
A: No, I don't want to tell you. 
 
Q: Do you have some story that you want to relate? 
 
A: No, no. I wanted to tell you what happened those times. 
 
Q: What happened? 
 
A: That was it. She said that she had the best time with O.J., and 
that was it, and that's why when you told me afterwards, it couldn't 
happen --  
 
Q: So what made her --  
 
A: -- because she had said she had great sex with O.J. 
 
Q: She had great sex with O.J. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: That's what she told you. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And what made her change her mind? 
 
A: What made her change her mind? 
 
Q: What made her decide to end the relationship? That is, what did 
she tell you, if anything? 
 
A: Oh, God, she said that Faye and she met a guy in Cabo and that 
he's a good-looking guy. 
 
Q: So she was interested in another man. 
 
A: Yes. She said --  
 
Q: This man named Brett? 
 
A: Yeah. She said, "I mess around with her" -- "with him." I'm 
sorry. 
 
Q: This is not Brett Shaves, by the way. Right? 
 
A: No, no, no, no, no, no. 
 
Q: This is another Brett. Right? 
 
A: Another Brett. He's an actor, apparently. 
 
Q: Okay. He lives here in town? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Have you seen him or ever spoken to him? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Before I get back to that subject again, why 
don't we identify each of these photographs. I will have copies 
made. What is the -- we are up to 152? 
 
I am marking these 152, 153, 154 and 155. 
 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibits 152 through 155 were marked for 
identification by the reporter and are attached hereto.)  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:

THE WITNESS: Oh, I'm sorry. It's --   
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Exhibit? 
 
A: Exhibit 155. 
 
Q: Okay. And this was taken in December of 1993?

A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now take a look at Exhibit 152, and who is the gentleman in 
that picture depicted with Mr. Simpson and Nicole? 
 
MR. KRAMER: I am handing the witness 152. 
 
THE WITNESS: That's Ron Fischman.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Okay. So you and Ron spent Christmas evening with the 
Simpsons? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Thank you. I'll get copies made. 
 
These are the negatives? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Yes, they are. 
 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I can keep these negatives? Can I keep these 
prints? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Actually, I can have copies of everything made 
for you, but these -- I took them this morning from my safe-deposit 
box. I need those for my lawsuit. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay, we'll talk about that at a break. Okay? 
 
Q: When -- did you tell Mr. Simpson about this relationship with 
Brett that Nicole had in May or June before Nicole's death? Did 
you tell him --  
 
A: Before Nicole's death? 
 
Q: Yeah, before. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever tell him anything about that relationship? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know if he knew about it? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You don't have any --  
 
A: I don't think --  
 
Q: -- information? 
 
A: What? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Let him finish his question. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Do you have any information as to whether he knew about 
Nicole's relationship with Brett? 
 
A: Do I have any information? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: During the -- a time after the Cabo trip, did Mr. Simpson call 
you from time to time inquiring what was wrong with Nicole; that 
they had a great time in Cabo and now she's not responding 
anymore? Did he ever call you and ask you anything like that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he make any calls to you during the months of May or June 
of 1994? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you have any contact at all with him during those two 
months? 
 
A: No contact. 
 
Q: You didn't see him at all. Is that right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Throughout the month of May and throughout June before 
Nicole's death, you didn't see or speak to O.J. Simpson. Is that 
true? 
 
A: I spoke to him at the recital. 
 
Q: What about before the recital? 
 
A: No, I don't think so. 
 
Q: So when before the recital on June 12th had you last spoken to 
O.J. Simpson? 
 
A: See, he was away. I don't know. 
 
Q: I know what his schedule was. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: You don't need to tell me. I'm just asking you when you last 
spoke to him. 
 
A: When I last spoke to him? 
 
Q: Before June 12, 1994, either on the telephone or in person. 
 
A: I spoke to him around -- oh, God, what -- May or April, around 
that time -- no, before -- I saw him -- he went to pick up the kids, 
and I was behind him. I said, "O.J., I want to talk to you," and then 
he went to -- he said, "Come to my house and we'll go around the 
neighborhood." 
 
I said, "Okay, fine." So I just had to bring my son to a game. I went 
to his house, and we walked around the block, and at that time I 
told O.J., "You have one" -- I wanted -- see, I told him, "You have" 
-- "you could still save your marriage. Why don't you go and move 
to Florida?" She wanted to do. "That's the only way you can save -- 
get out of L.A." 
 
Q: That's the only way you could save your marriage? 
 
A: Yeah. I said, you know, "If you really want your marriage, 
Nicole wants her family, why don't you go and move to Florida?" 
And that was our conversation. 
 
Q: What did he say? 
 
A: Well, he said, you know, "This whole thing is crazy," you 
know. "I'm back with Paula, but I don't know what Nicole wants. 
Nicole wants me back. I try to go back, and then she keeps on 
changing her mind. What's going on here, Cora? What's going on?" 
 
I said, you know, "Give her some time. Give her some time. You 
know, she wants to work things out, but" -- you know, that's pretty 
much the gist of our conversation. 
 
Q: And did Nicole ask you to have that conversation? 
 
A: No. I volunteered because I wanted to help their relationship 
because Nicole really wanted to go back, but she just didn't know 
when. 
 
Because there were times when she said, "Cora, I really want to go 
back because I want to have my family back." Then at the end she 
says, you know, "When" -- she says, "You know, O.J. keeps on 
leaving me, you know. Every time he goes on trips I feel lonely." 
And so that's why she goes out with Faye and stuff like that. 
 
Q: Why did you suggest to O.J. that he take Nicole to Florida to 
live? 
 
A: Because when they tried to reconcile in April --  
 
Q: Of what year? The year before? 
 
A: Oh, God. '93. 
 
Q: Yes? 
 
A: O.J. said this is not the town for them. He says, "All these 
women, who are these women?" Stuff like that.  
 
So O.J. said -- I mean Nicole said, "I'II move to wherever you" -- 
you know, "We can move." 
 
 
So they suggested Florida because he loves golf, and Nicole and I 
even took golf lessons because she really wanted to work things 
out with -- you know, we took golf lessons at the Riviera Country 
Club. 
 
Q: So you -- did Nicole suggest to you in May of 1994 that she 
wanted to move to Florida --  
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: -- with O.J.? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when did she tell you that? 
 
A: Well, she said, "I'm gonna move to Florida," you know. "That's 
where we're gonna move, and we're gonna play golf," you know. 
She just wanted her family. 
 
Q: Now, when you -- Nicole had not been seeing any other men 
other than O.J. from 1993 in April until this incident in Cabo with 
Brett. Is that right? 
 
A: Well, she saw Marcus Allen intermittently. 
 
Q: But you understood starting in April of 1993 that O.J. and 
Nicole were going to try to work things out. Right? 
 
A: Oh, yes, they tried, yes, right. 
 
Q: And Mr. Simpson stopped seeing Paula Barbieri. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And that process lasted for about a year. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then when Nicole came back from Cabo, sometime when 
she  -- after she returned, she told you that she was not going to see 
Mr. Simpson anymore. She was going to end the relationship. 
Right? 
 
A: At some point, yes. 
 
Q: And she told you she was interested in this Brett person. Right? 
 
A: She was not interested with this Brett person, no. She really 
didn't care about the guy. 
 
Q: But she wanted to see him. 
 
A: She just wanted to have that --  
 
Q: Freedom to date. 
 
A: Right. She just wanted, yeah, to see the guy with Faye. 
 
Q: Did she tell you that she wanted to date other men as well? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she tell you what had caused her to decide to end her 
reconciliation process with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: She said that she was confused, that she still wants to -- she still 
wants -- she wanted the freedom, and that's about it. 
 
Q: She wanted the freedom. 
 
A: Right. She still wanted to go out with the girls. 
 
Q: So those were the reasons: She wanted to go out with the girls 
and she wanted the freedom. Right? 
 
A: Yeah, because O.J. will not allow him --  her to go out with 
girls and stuff like that if she'd go back to O.J. 
 
Q: Okay. When you say "go back to O.J.," you mean move into 
Rockingham? 
 
A: Exactly, right. 
 
Q: Okay. So she then decided she wasn't prepared to move back 
into Rockingham and give up her freedom. Is that right? 
 
A: Exactly. 
 
Q: Okay. But you thought that you might try to patch things up 
between O.J. and her by talking to O.J. without asking Nicole for 
her permission in advance. Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And when is the date of this walk around the house? 
 
Was this Rockingham you walked around? 
 
A: Uh-huh. We walked --  
 
MR. KRAMER: Is that a yes? 
 
THE WITNESS: You mean O.J. and I? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: We just walked around -- I mean just around Ashford, and then 
we went to his office. 
 
Q: And when did this occur? 
 
A: When? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Oh, I don't remember. Somewhere around May. When he got 
back from Puerto Rico. I don't remember that. It's got to be May. 
May? April? I don't know. 
 
Q: And where did you bump into Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: At Carl Thorp, my kids' school. I told you he went to pick up 
his kids, and I was behind him to pick up my kids. 
 
Q: And was that the first time you had spoken to Mr. Simpson in --  
how long? 
 
A: Months. 
 
Q: You hadn't spoken to him since his return from Cabo or Puerto 
Rico?  
 
A: I had not spoken to him? Yes, I have not spoken to him. 
 
Q: And was this before or after Nicole's birthday on May 19?  
 
A: Was this before -- before.  
 
Q: It was before her birthday.  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what is your best estimate of the date? 
 
A: I don't remember. I can't  --  I would say late April, early May. 
 
Q: Did you go to Christian Reichardt's party on April 30? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. May 8 was a Sunday, and that was Mother's Day. Was 
your discussion with Mr. Simpson before or after Mother's Day? 
 
A: Before. 
 
Q: Before Mother's Day. Okay. Now, can you hear Mr. Simpson, 
by the way, talking to his lawyer, saying things like "That's not 
true" and so forth? Can you hear that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. If you do hear those comments, please disregard them. 
Okay?  
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q: Don't let him -- By the way, is his presence here influencing 
your testimony at all? 
 
A: Not at all. 
 
Q: Okay. It's very important that you not let his presence affect 
your testimony, that you tell the truth. 
 
A: I am under oath. Right? 
 
Q: You are under oath, exactly.  
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q: When Nicole told you that she was going to end the 
reconciliation process with O.J. Simpson, did you try to talk her 
out of it? 
 
A: Not really, no. 
 
Q: What did you say to her when she told you that's what she 
planned to do? 
 
A: I don't remember. We had so many discussions that I don't --  I 
can't remember. 
 
Q: What was her general state of mind during this time frame after 
she came back from Cabo and when she was talking to you about 
ending this reconciliation with O.J. Simpson? As communicated to 
you by her, what was her state of mind? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Do you mean her mood? Is that what you mean? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: What she was thinking, what her thoughts and feelings were. 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: She had this fear of aging. She said, you know, 
"I'm afraid of getting old," you know. "I'll be 60 years old and 
nobody's gonna look at me. O.J.'s gonna be 60 and O.J. will still 
find a 20-, 30-year-old wife, and I'll be 60; nobody's gonna look at 
me." So that was pretty much the stuff that -- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did she communicate to you that because of her growing 
awareness of her age, she had an attraction for younger men? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you try to talk her out of those kinds of feelings and 
thoughts? 
 
A: Actually, I said to her, "You just have to be careful," you know. 
That's pretty much what, you know... 
 
Q: Did you and she have any discussions about whether Mr. 
Simpson knew about her seeing other men? 
 
A: I'm sorry. Could you repeat that? 
 
Q: Did you and she talk about whether or not O.J. Simpson knew 
that she was seeing other men in April or May of '94? 
 
A: If O.J. knew? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she tell you not to tell him? 
 
A: No, she didn't tell me that, because she knew I wouldn't tell O.J. 
 
Q: You would not tell him. 
 
A: No. I mean... 
 
Q: You wouldn't betray that confidence. Right? 
 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did -- what happened after you told O.J. about your idea that 
they should move off to Florida together? Did anything come of 
that to your knowledge? 
 
A: Well, O.J. said, you know, "Nicole has to have a sense of 
commitment." That's pretty much the conversation. 
 
Q: And O.J. was telling you that she lacked that commitment at 
that time? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And therefore he was not prepared to move to Florida? 
 
A: No, he didn't say he's not prepared to. I mean, that was just the 
thought that I --  
 
Q: Did he tell you that if Nicole would give him that commitment, 
that he would move to Florida? 
 
A: Yeah, they would move anywhere. They even wanted to move 
to Cabo. 
 
Q: Did you then communicate to Nicole your conversation with 
O.J.? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Never told her about it? 
 
A: But she told me that, "I heard you spoke to O.J." 
 
I said, "Oh, why? He told you?" And she said, "Yeah," so that was 
it, so --  
 
Q: When did she tell you that? 
 
A: A week after, two weeks after. Later on she told me. 
 
Q: And was she upset with you? 
 
A: She was not upset with me, no. 
 
Q: Did she tell you whether she was going to make a commitment 
to him at that time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: At any time from this point when she told you that she was 
going to end the relationship did she tell you that she planned to go 
back to O.J. Simpson? 
 
 
A: At some point in time, yeah, she was planning to. 
 
Q: When did she tell you that? 
 
A: She told me that several times. She said --  
 
Q: I am focusing very specifically on the time periods of May and 
June of 1994. 
 
A: Okay. 
 
MR. BAKER: You cut her off very badly on that one. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: After she came back from Cabo in April of '94, not the past, and 
I would like to know: After she had the conversation with you 
when she said that she was going to stop the reconciliation process 
with Mr. Simpson, did she thereafter ever tell you that she planned 
to go back to him, to move into the house, for example, or anything 
like that?  
 
A: No, because she was angry.  
 
Q: She was angry? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: What was she angry about? 
 
A: She was angry at -- she was mad at O.J. 
 
Q: Why? 
 
A: Because she spoke to O.J. that --  she said, you know, "O.J.'s 
trying to steal all my friends," and, you know, she said, "It's always 
O.J. trying to steal, trying to take all my friends away from me." 
 
Q: Because they had split up and O.J. was responding by taking 
her friends? That's what she thought? 
 
A: Well, that's what she told -- yeah. She thought that Faye -- that 
Faye was getting to be on his side. 
 
Q: And she thought that O.J. was trying to buy some of her friends, 
too. Right? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know exactly  -- what do you mean, 
"buy"? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Like pay Christian Reichardt $5,000. She made that comment to 
you, "He's trying to buy my friends," did she not? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And years before when she initially split up with O.J., 
she confided in you that she felt very bad that many of her friends 
had abandoned her at that time --  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- in favor of O.J.  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: But you did not abandon her then. 
 
A: Well, I became friendly with her when she split up already, so I 
was not friendly with them during the time they were married. 
 
Q: But she saw the same thing happening again in May of 1994. 
 
A: Exactly. 
 
Q: Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And who were the friends that she told you were abandoning 
her in favor of O.J.? 
 
A: Faye Resnick.  
 
Q: Anyone else?  
 
A: That's it. At that time she was very close to Faye. 
 
Q: You and she -- throughout this period of time in May and June 
of 1994 before she died, you remained in a very close relationship 
with Nicole. Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Okay. You never had a falling-out where you didn't talk to each 
other for days or weeks at a time. Right? 
 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. And you used to run almost every day. Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And in the --  
 
A: Except the time when he had -- she had pneumonia. 
 
Q: She had double pneumonia?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And how long was she confined to the house? Do you 
remember? 
 
A: Oh, God, I don't remember. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Give your best estimate. 
 
THE WITNESS: I'd say a week.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: A week? Did you visit her while she was ill? 
 
A: One time, yes. I mean, I did almost every day, but Faye was 
always there.  
 
Q: Okay. And would you call her on the phone? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So you didn't abandon her while she was ill with pneumonia, 
did you?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. You kept in close contact with Nicole. Right? 
 
A: Yes. Uh-huh. 
 
Q: And Faye was there also. Right? 
 
A: When I was there, yes, she was there. 
 
Q: And did you see Mr. Simpson there frequently during that 
period of time? 
 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Nicole tell you that Mr. Simpson was trying to care for her 
during her illness? 
 
A: Yeah. She said he sent flowers and chicken soup. 
 
Q: And what did she tell you about that? 
 
A: That was it. Because, you know, when I walked in there, I said, 
"Gee, you got flowers." 
 
She said, "Oh, yeah, O.J. gave them to me." 
 
Q: Did she tell you that because she got these flowers, that she was 
changing her mind and would now go back to O.J.? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Did she tell you that O.J. was being very nice to her? 
 
A: With the chicken soup, I guess so, yeah. 
 
MR. KELLY: Miss Fischman, I can't hear you back here. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: "With the chicken soup, I guess so." 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did she tell you that O.J. had given her a birthday present? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did she tell you about that? 
 
A: She told me that she got a Cartier lighter and a bracelet. 
 
Q: What kind of bracelet? 
 
A: It's a diamond with sapphire bracelet. 
 
Q: Were you shocked that O.J. had given her a cigarette lighter? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: O.J. was anti-smoking, wasn't he? 
 
A: I guess -- I don't even know, you know. I mean... 
 
Q: You don't know? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Don't you remember an incident in a restaurant where he was 
ranting and raving about the women smoking and people smoking? 
 
A: Yes, I remember that. 
 
Q: So you knew he didn't approve of smoking. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Anyway, what about this bracelet? 
 
A: The bracelet? 
 
Q: Yeah. What kind of bracelet did Nicole describe to you? 
 
A: I mean, it was this diamonds with sapphire in the middle, and 
she said, "You know, I can't have this. This is not me." 
 
That's not Nicole. She doesn't use those -- she's not very flashy 
when it comes to jewelry. 
 
Q: Did she tell you -- did she ever show you the bracelet? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: When? 
 
A: When we went to Starbucks. She wore it. She said, "It's just not 
me." 
 
Q: Was it an expensive bracelet? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: What did --  
 
A: What? 
 
Q: What was your estimate of its value? 
 
A: I don't know. It was diamonds and platinum with sapphire. I 
don't know. 
 
Q: Okay. Did she tell you why Mr. Simpson had given her such an 
expensive bracelet? 
 
A: Well, that was actually, you know, I guess -- I don't know. I 
mean. she -- 
 
Q: What did she tell you? 
 
A: She felt funny. She just felt funny with that bracelet. She said, 
"I feel guilty," you know. 
 
"It's not my" -- "It's not my"... 
 
Q: Now, she returned that bracelet, didn't she? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And didn't she tell you that she wasn't -- she could not be 
bought by Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: No, she didn't say that. She said you know, "I cannot" -- she 
said, "I'm trying to" -- she felt funny with that bracelet, and I guess 
at the time she said, you know, "I don't know what O.J.'s trying to 
do, if he's trying to buy me." I mean... 
 
Q: That's what I'm asking you about. What did she say in that 
regard? 
 
A: That's as far as I can remember. 
 
Q: That O.J. was trying to buy her. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And she could not be bought. That's what she told you. Right? 
 
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Okay. And did she tell you what Mr. Simpson's reaction was 
when she returned the bracelet? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: You don't remember? 
 
A: No. I don't think we even talked about it. 
 
Q: About her returning the bracelet? 
 
A: Well, she did say she returned the bracelet because she felt 
funny about it. Because you have to understand, she was already -- 
she was going out with this guy, and she said, you know, "I feel 
funny with this bracelet. It's so expensive. It's not me. Where am I 
going to use this?" 
 
Q: After she returned the bracelet, did she ever tell you whether 
O.J. Simpson became angry toward her in the last few weeks of her 
life? 
 
A: Angry? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Oh, God, I don't remember now. I don't remember now. 
 
Q: You have no recollection at all?  
 
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered.  
 
THE WITNESS: He became angry because of what happened 
between Faye and Nicole. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  
 
Q: What happened? 
 
A: Well, Nicole called me and said, "Oh, I'm not going to talk to 
O.J. again because O.J.'s trying to get all my friends." And she was 
upset that Faye was invited to this sports spectacular that -- this 
thing in July -- 
  
Q: July 4. Right? 
 
A: Right. And... I'm trying to remember. 
 
Q: Take your time. 
 
A: So she called O.J. and said, "Why are you taking my friends?" 
 
And then O.J. got upset apparently and said, you know, "I'm not" -- 
"I didn't invite Faye. I invited"  --  "I invited Christian, but Faye 
volunteered," and stuff like that. He says, you know, 
"Apparently"... 
 
Q: And that's the only thing that Nicole told you O.J. and she were 
fighting about in the last couple of weeks?  
 
A: Yes. She had this fear of losing Faye. She didn't want to lose 
Faye because, you know, she lost all her friends, and now just 
because they're splitting up, now all of a sudden, you know, "O.J.'s 
trying to take my friends away from me." 
 
MR. BAKER: Objection to the term "fighting." 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: What did you say in response to that? 
 
A: I don't remember. I mean...  
 
Q: You don't remember? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Could we go off the record for just a moment, 
please? Is that all right?  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Take it --

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the

BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Now, isn't it true that O.J. and Nicole had a big argument about 
this subject of --  
 
MR. BAKER: Objection. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q:  --  her friends being invited by O.J.? Right? 
 
MR. BAKER: Objection to the term "big" and "argument." 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: They had a big fight and argument about this topic. Correct? 
Nicole related this to you. Right? 
 
 
A: Exactly, right. 
 
Q: And isn't it true Nicole told you she called O.J. and said. "How 
dare you buy everything. 
You took my friends away, took my family away," all the things 
important in her life? Isn't it true that Nicole told you that? 
 
A: She said that, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And isn't it true that she told you that she told O.J., "You 
can't buy me with this bracelet"? Isn't that true also? 
 
A: She told me that, yes. 
 
Q: And isn't it also true that O.J. called you and said, "What's 
going on here? I left her in April. In Cabo we were like lovers. We 
were planning to be together. She was planning to move in. You 
know, we had the best sex, you know. She was going to follow me 
to Florida, and then she was going to go to Florida because there 
was a wedding there. She was going to go to Florida and she was 
going to go to Puerto Rico with me and all of a sudden, what 
happened? What happened?" 
 
Didn't O.J. say that to you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, you also know that O.J. and Nicole fought about things 
other than Nicole's friends in those last weeks. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. BAKER: Objection to the term "fought." 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: What else did they fight about? 
 
A: What else did they fight about? 
 
MR. KRAMER: That's the question. Do you have the question in 
mind? What else did they fight about? There was an objection 
there, but that's the question. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Well, there was an issue about Nicole being upset that O.J. was 
going to get her thrown out of the house on the streets with the 
children. Correct? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes, she told me that, yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And she told you that she was very upset with O.J. because he 
was threatening to have the IRS take action against her. Right? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes, she got a letter from O.J. about the house, 
you know, the... 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And she was extremely upset about that, wasn't she? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And she told you that she viewed that as a threat to her security 
and the security of her children. Correct? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: So it's fair to say that in the last days of Nicole's life, you knew 
that she was extremely upset with O.J. Simpson. 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation and leading. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  
 
Q: Correct? 
 
A: She was upset, yes. 
 
Q: And she was seeing a therapist or counselor at that time over 
this, was she not? 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know.  
 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: She told you that she was seeing somebody because of how 
upset she was over what was happening with Mr. Simpson. 
Correct? 
 
A: She was seeing -- they were seeing a therapist? I don't know. 
 
Q: Did she tell you that she was seeing a therapist during this 
period of time, in the last month or so of her life? 
 
A: No, I don't remember. I don't think she was. I don't remember. 
 
Q: She never told you about that? 
 
A: She was seeing Mr. Michaels, Barry Michaels. 
 
Q: Barry Michaels? 
 
A: Yes, she saw Barry Michaels a couple times. 
 
Q: Near the end? 
 
A: I don't know if it was near the end. Probably, yeah. 
 
Q: Have you seen Barry Michaels?  
 
A: Yeah, I saw Mr. Michaels, too. 
 
Q: On your own? 
 
A: Yes. No. With Ron Fischman. 
 
Q: Did you refer Nicole to Barry Michaels? 
 
A: No. They referred -- Nicole referred Barry Michaels to us. 
 
Q: Okay. And where is Mr. Michaels' office? 
 
A: I don't remember.  
 
Q: What city is it in? 
 
A: Los Angeles. 
 
Q: Beverly Hills? What street is it on? 
 
 
MR. KRAMER: You're nodding your head. Is that --  
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. I don't remember. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: What street is it on?  
 
A: What street? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: I don't remember. I don't remember. 
 
Q: Nicole told you she was seeing Barry Michaels. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, Nicole also told you in the last few weeks of her 
life that she had a fear of Mr. Simpson. Correct? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: She -- yes.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Now, did you tell her to -- did you give her any advice with 
respect to her statements to you that she was afraid of Mr. 
Simpson? 
 
A: Did I give her advice?  
 
Q: Yeah. As a friend. 
 
A: At that time I -- I just told her just to be careful, you know. As 
long as she's happy, as long as, you know, she doesn't get into 
trouble. 
 
Q: Did you tell her to call the battered women's shelter? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Sojourn?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you know that she did so?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she tell you that?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, you also knew that based on what Nicole told you, 
that O.J. was following her around during these last weeks of her 
life. Correct? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. Vague. 
 
THE WlTNESS: She mentioned to me when we were at Starbucks, 
she says, "You know, Cora, I think O.J.'s following us again." 
 
I said, "What do you mean?" 
 
"I saw this Bentley." 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And what did you say? 
 
A: I said, "Oh, really?" That was it.  
 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: I said, "Oh, really?" 
 
Q: You discussed this with Barbara Walters, didn't you? 
 
A: I mentioned it to him, yes. Yes, to her, yes. 
 
Q: In fact, Barbara Walters said to you: "Cora, there have been 
rumors that 
O.J. was stalking Nicole, spying on her. 
 
"Cora Fischman: Yes. 
 
"Barbara Walters: Do you know anything about this? 
 
"Cora Fischman: He did follow us. But he said it was just 
coincidence, you know, that it just so happened that he was there at 
a place where we were." 
 
A: Okay, that happened when they just got separated. There were 
two incidents: One was at the Tryst, okay, it was an opening night 
of this restaurant on La Cienega, and one was Mezzaluna in 
Beverly Hills. 
 
Q: And the latter one was in the weeks before Nicole's death. 
Right? 
 
A: What do you mean, "the latter one"? No, those two --  
 
Q: The Mezzaluna incident. 
 
A: No. The Mezzaluna in Beverly Hills, I remember we went on a 
Tuesday, and that was -- we walked in there. I was in the 
bathroom, and then O.J. was there with a friend, and that was --  at 
that time Nicole wanted to go there because that was the place to 
go on a Tuesday. 
 
Q: What year was this?  
 
A: 1992. 
 
Q: When you told Barbara Fischman that O.J. Simpson was 
following you and Nicole --  
 
MR. KRAMER: Is this about Barbara Walters? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me. 
 
Q: When you told Barbara Walters that O.J. Simpson was 
following you and Nicole, when was he following you and Nicole? 
 
A: That was in 1992. 
 
Q: You were telling Barbara Walters about incidents that occurred 
in 1992. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And not in 1994?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: But you knew that O.J. was following Nicole in 1994 because 
she told you. 
 
A: Exactly. 
 
Q: Okay. And you knew that O.J. had done this in the past, right, 
based on your own personal experiences? 
 
A: Right, about what Nicole told me, yes. 
 
Q: Now, what following of Nicole did she --  what following of 
Nicole by O.J. did she report to you in the last few weeks of her 
life? 
 
 
A: That was it. 
 
Q: Relate it to me again. What did she tell you? 
 
A: She told me, "O.J.'s following me." You know what? She said, 
"O.J. followed me. I think O.J.'s car was behind me." That was it. 
"I think he's following me." 
 
I said "Oh, really?" I said, "Oh, okay." 
 
Q: Did you do anything about that when she told you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, and it's true that you told Barbara Walters that Nicole was 
very fearful of O.J. Correct? 
 
A: Very fearful? 
 
Q: Yes. Those are your words. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Correct? Now, in fact Nicole told you, "Oh, I'm so scared of 
O.J. I'm so scared of O.J.," didn't she? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Correct? 
 
A: "I'm so scared of O.J."? 
 
Q: "I'm so scared of O.J." Those are the words of Nicole that she 
told you. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you had known about O.J. beating Nicole in their marriage. 
Right? 
 
MR. BAKER: Objecton to the term "beating." 
 
THE WITNESS: She told me the 1989 incident. That was it. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: She told you that O.J. beat her then. Right? 
 
A: That 1989, yes. 
 
Q: Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And when did she tell you that O.J. beat her in 1989? 
 
A: I don't know. During one of our runs she told me she felt funny 
about it. 
 
Q: Now, in fact during one of your runs you told her that -- or you 
showed her that you had some black-and-blue marks, didn't you? 
 
A: I had? 
 
Q: On your body, yeah. 
 
A: I had black-and-blue marks? 
 
Q: Yeah, you told her you had some bruises. And she said, "That's 
nothing. You should see what's happened to me." 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes, she told me that, yeah. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Referring to the beatings that she had received at the hands of 
Mr. Simpson. Correct? 
 
MR. BAKER: Objection. She said the 1989 incident. 
 
THE WITNESS: She didn't --   
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Don't be led by what the lawyers are trying to coach you to say. 
 
A: No, she didn't tell me that, though. She said -- she didn't say that 
to me, that she said, "O.J. did this to me," but she said, you know, 
"You should see"  -- she said, "That's nothing." 
 
Q: What's nothing? 
 
A: She said, "You should see, that's nothing compared to what I 
had." 
 
 
Q: Meaning as a result of being beat. 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: That's how you understood it. Correct? 
 
A: Exactly, yes. 
 
Q: Meaning that the beating injuries that she received were worse 
than the bruises that you were showing her. Correct? 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Correct, yeah.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: In fact she said your bruises were nothing compared to hers. 
Correct? Those were her words. Right? 
 
A: She -- yeah, she said that, yes. 
 
Q: Now, Nicole told you during your many, many talks together 
that she could not stop O.J.'s womanizing. True? 
 
A: I don't remember. Did I say that?  
 
MR. BAKER: You want to show her the transcript? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: "Barbara Walters: What did you talk about on those 10-mile 
runs? 
 
"Cora Fischman: Well, you know, when you run 10 miles it's kind 
of hard to talk because you're huffing and puffing. We talked about 
our lives. She always was talking about how she always had 
wanted to be, how O.J. could just change -- how O.J. could just 
stop womanizing. 
 
"Barbara Walters: She knew of the rumors that O.J. had other 
women when they were married? 
 
"Cora Fischman: Yes, she knew that." That's true, what you told 
Barbara Walters? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did Nicole tell you about O.J.'s womanizing and how she 
couldn't stop it? 
 
A: How she could stop it? 
 
Q: How she couldn't stop it. 
 
A: She couldn't stop it? I don't remember. 
 
Q: You don't remember? You're covering your mouth up also with 
your hands. 
 
A: I'm blanking out here, so --  
 
Q: Well, we want your best testimony. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
MR. BAKER: Would you like to take a break, Ma'am.? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah, let's take a short break --  
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, I'm blanking out here. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: -- and get a cup of coffee. 
 
THE VIDE0GRAPHER: This is the end of tape No. 2. The time is

approximately 2:57. This is the beginning of tape No. 3. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Before Nicole died, she told you that she was no longer seeing 
this Brett guy that she met in Cabo. Correct? 
 
A: She was no longer seeing? I don't remember. I don't remember. 
 
Q: You have to speak up.  
 
A: I don't remember, so...  
 
Q: You told the detectives that she wasn't seeing anyone at the time 
of her death. Is that right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
 
Q: So she wasn't seeing this Brett fellow anymore. Correct? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Is that correct? That's what she told you, that she had stopped 
seeing this fellow? 
 
A: Well, you know, she was still seeing Marcus Allen. 
 
Q: You looked at Mr. Simpson when you said that. Are you 
concerned about his --  
 
A: Well, because he wrote it down, too, and I felt bad because they 
were friends, so --  
 
Q: You felt bad that --  
 
A: Marcus and O.J. were friends. 
 
Q: -- that Marcus and O.J. were friends, and just shortly before 
Nicole's death that Nicole was seeing Marcus Allen. Right? 
 
A: Well, I don't know before the death, but they were still talking. 
 
Q: In May and June of 1994. Correct?  
 
A: I would say correct, yes. 
 
Q: And Nicole told you that. Right? Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you saw Marcus at Nicole's condo at Bundy. Correct? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You saw his car there. Right?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What did Nicole tell you about her seeing Marcus Allen in the 
May and June of '94 time frame? Tell me what she related to you, 
as best you can recall. 
 
A: There was one day where after Nicole and I had coffee I said, 
"What happened?" 
 
 
She said, "Well, I just saw Brett," and then that same day she saw 
Marcus Allen. 
 
Q: Did she call you after that day to tell you that she had seen 
Marcus or  -- I'm a little confused. 
 
A: No. In the afternoon. We saw each other in the afternoon. 
 
Q: And she told you in that same day she had seen both Brett and 
Marcus?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Together or separately?  
 
A: Separately. 
 
Q: And what did she say about seeing Brett? 
 
That she had had sex with him? 
 
A: Well, she didn't go -- she just said that words, "I saw Brett 
today." 
 
Q: Where? At her --  
 
A: At her apartment, at her condo. 
 
Q: And where did she say she had seen Marcus Allen? 
 
A: I assumed that same place. 
 
Q: And when was this day when she told you that she had seen 
both Brett and Marcus Allen on the same day? 
 
A: When? 
 
Q: Yeah. And maybe you can think about this in reference to her 
birthday and her bout with pneumonia. Was it before or after? 
 
A: I'm trying to -- it could be before her pneumonia. 
 
Q: Was this the first time in a while that she had told you about 
Marcus Allen, about seeing Marcus Allen again? 
 
A: If -- I'm sorry. Could you repeat the question? 
 
Q: When she told you that she had seen Marcus Allen on this 
occasion when you had coffee together --  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- where was this? In Starbucks? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was this the first time in a while that she had mentioned Marcus 
Allen to you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. So to your knowledge she hadn't been seeing Marcus 
Allen for a long time before this conversation. Is that right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And this conversation was the first time that you found out that 
she was seeing Marcus Allen again. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what did you say when she told you that? 
 
A: I said -- I don't remember. I was -- just smiled. I said, you know, 
"Why? O.J.'s out of town again?" You know, so that was it. I 
mean... 
 
Q: Meaning that she would not feel secure about seeing Marcus 
Allen while O.J. was in town? 
 
A: Well, no. Marcus calls Nicole when O.J. is out of town. 
 
Q: Marcus to your knowledge would seize the opportunity of O.J. 
being out of town --  
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation --  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q:  -- to call Nicole and see her. Is that what you're saying? 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: That's what she told me, but --  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: That Marcus liked to call her when Marcus knew or believed 
that O.J. was out of town. 
 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Correct? 
 
A: Marcus [sic] was out of town. Correct. 
 
Q: And Nicole told you how upset O.J. would be if he were to find 
out that Marcus was seeing Nicole. 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: At that time Nicole didn't say that, no. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: But you knew from prior conversations that it was a source of 
great anger on O.J. Simpson's part. Correct? 
 
A: That's what she told me, yes. 
 
Q: And you knew that O.J. Simpson and Marcus Allen were very 
close friends. Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you knew that Marcus Allen had seen Nicole romantically 
the year before, before he was married to Katherine. Right? 
 
A: Right, yes. 
 
Q: And you knew that when Mr. Simpson found out about that, 
how upset he was. Right? 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: He was upset because he was shocked. He said, 
"What more surprises are you going to give me?" So... 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And you knew that O.J. Simpson was a very jealous guy. 
Right? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Nicole told me, yes.  
 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And Nicole told you that O.J. Simpson was a very jealous guy. 
Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And very obsessive. Right? 
 
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Nicole told you that O.J. was very obsessive. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, did you tell Nicole, when she told you in May of 1994 
that she was seeing Marcus Allen again, to be careful and look out 
for her physical safety? 
 
A: Did I? 
 
Q: Yeah. Did you warn her?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Did she talk to you again before she died about Marcus 
Ahen?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: That was the only time?  
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: You never brought it up?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And did you talk to anyone else about Nicole seeing Marcus 
Allen? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you mention it to Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever told him about this conversation? 
 
A: I mentioned to him, yes. 
 
Q: When? 
 
A: When the book came out.  
 
Q: What book? 
 
A: Faye Resnick's book came out, yeah. And he asked me, "Is this 
true?" I said, "Yes," you know, and he didn't know that it happened 
after their reconciliation. 
 
Q: Mr. Simpson did not know about the relationship between 
Nicole and Marcus in May of '94, according to what he told you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: That's what he told you: He didn't know. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. You don't know one way or the other whether he knew at 
the time. Right? 
 
A: At that time, if I knew? 
 
Q: You don't know whether or not he knew at that time. Right? 
 
A: Yes, I don't know. 
 
Q: You never talked to him about it then. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, you testified previously about having a conversation with 
Mr. Simpson when he was -- you took the walk, and he was 
discussing how Nicole would not make a commitment to him, and 
you suggested that they go off to Florida. 
 
Do you recall that?  
 
A: Move to Florida.  
 
Q: And then there was other testimony that you gave a little while 
ago about Mr. Simpson expressing disbelief in why Nicole was 
doing this to him, that they had had a good time in Cabo, and he 
didn't understand what was going on. 
 
Do you recall that?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, that conversation about his confusion over what was 
going on with Nicole, when did that occur? 
 
A: That was when we were sitting in the -- in his office that day 
that I wanted to talk to him. 
 
Q: That all occurred in the same time? 
 
A: Right. That conversation, yes. 
 
Q: I read to you statements that you had made on tape where you 
said O.J. said: 
 
"What's going on here? I left her in April in Cabo. We were like 
lovers. We were planning to be together. She was going to move 
in. We had the best sex. She was going to following me to Florida 
because there was a wedding there and she was going to Puerto 
Rico with me and all of a sudden, what happened? What 
happened?" 
 
A: I must have said that, yes. 
 
Q: That's what O.J. Simpson said to you in his office? 
 
A: No, no, no. 
 
Q: When did he say this to you? 
 
A: I think that was one of a telephone conversation we had. Yeah, 
one of the telephone conversation.  
 
Q: And he called you from his home?  
 
A: I don't know, but he called me. 
 
Q: You were at your house --  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- at 200 North Rockingham? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And what did you tell him when he said these things to 
you? 
 
A: I said, you know, "Just give her some time," you know. "She 
really ultimately wants to move back, and she's just confused right 
now." I even told him, I said, "You're the one who even told her 
that she's going through a phase in her life where, you know, in the 
thirties she's going to go through this difficult time." 
 
And even Nicole told me how O.J. is understanding. You know, 
"At least he understands what I'm going through." And she even 
told me, you know, "You know, Cora, it's really not O.J. It's not 
Ron. It's us," you know. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let me read that back. One second. 
 
Q: "It's," you know, "...Ron." Who's Ron? 
 
A: Ron Fischman. 
 
Q: What does Ron Fischman have to do with this conversation 
you're having with O.J. Simpson about why Nicole has left him? 
 
A: Why Nicole has left him?  
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Well, we always talked about how we need to do something for 
ourselves, you know. You know, "We're married to wealthy men, 
and we needed -- we need to do something for ourself," you know, 
I told Nicole. 
 
"We cannot just run all the time. And it's not Ron. It's not O.J. It's 
us," you know. That's what Nicole said. 
 
She says, you know, "Cora, we're the ones screwed up, not O.J., 
not Ron. It's us. 99 percent of women would love to have what we 
have." That's what she told me.  
 
Q: And you were relating to O.J. Simpson what Nicole and you 
had said? 
 
A: Yes, exactly. 
 
Q: Trying to make him feel better, that it was not him that was the 
problem, but it was that Nicole was going -- 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q:  -- through this phase of her life?  
 
A: Exactly. 
 
Q: And that he, O.J., had to be patient and understanding before he 
could get her back? 
 
A: I didn't say it that way, but --  
 
Q: But that was the sense of what you were saying to him? 
 
A: Pretty much, yes. 
 
Q: And what was his reaction to that? 
 
A: Nothing. I mean... 
 
Q: So that's a telephone conversation. Right? That's what you said. 
Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And can you remember anything else Mr. Simpson said to you 
in that telephone conversation? 
 
A: I don't remember any more. 
 
Q: You're covering your mouth up.  
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you tell Nicole that Mr. Simpson had said these 
things to you on the telephone? 
 
A: Did I tell Nicole?  
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: I must have. 
 
Q: Why do you say that? 
 
A: Because Nicole was the one who told me about this. 
 
Q: You were reporting a conversation that you had with O.J. 
Simpson. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And what I am asking you is whether you told Nicole about 
your conversation with O.J. Simpson. 
 
A: I usually don't tell Nicole about my conversation with O.J. 
 
Q: Okay. And the next conversation you had with O.J. Simpson 
was when you had the talk in his office? 
 
 
A: The next? 
 
Q: After this telephone call?  
 
A: No, no, no, no, no. No. 
 
Q: What do you mean, "No"? 
 
A: He just got back from a trip, and I saw him picking up the kids. 
So that's when --  
 
Q: What I am trying to find out is: You've now told me about two 
conversations: One telephone call, which we just discussed what 
was said, and then another conversation in which you met him at 
the school and went off to the office. 
 
A: You know what? It could be that conversation was probably just 
in the office then. I don't remember, you know, between telephone 
conversation and discussion in the office. 
 
Q: You don't recall if there were two conversations or one? 
 
A: I don't. Probably I just had one, and that was all the 
conversation I had. 
 
Q: Why are you saying probably you only had one? 
 
A: Because I don't remember. It's been a while, and I had 
discussion with both of them for a long time. This is -- you know, 
I'm trying to rehash my memory here. 
 
Q: Okay. So you can't recall if there was two or one. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you speak to Mr. Simpson after he gave Nicole the 
bracelet? 
 
A: Did I speak to him? I don't remember. 
 
Q: Now, you know that there was an argument between Nicole and 
O.J. when she returned the bracelet to him? 
 
MR. BAKER: Objection. Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, Nicole told me. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And what did she tell you about that? 
 
A: That she told me that O.J. was upset. 
 
Q: About what? 
 
A: About her returning the bracelet. 
 
Q: And what did O.J. -- what did Nicole tell you that O.J. said? 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember. I don't remember. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Isn't it true that Nicole told you at that time she didn't want to 
have anything more to do with Mr. Simpson? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: She was very mad at him. She was very mad at 
him, yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And she told you that she was very mad at him. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And that she didn't want to have anything more to do with him. 
Right?  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Okay. And do you know what made her feel that way? 
 
A: What made her feel that way? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Because she felt that O.J. was taking her friends 
away from her, one; and two was because of that letter that O.J. 
wrote to her about the IRS. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did you try to talk Nicole into taking O.J. back? 
 
A: Did I try to tell Nicole? 
 
Q: Yeah, during this period of time. 
 
A: No, not reaUy. 
 
Q: Did you come to believe that --  
 
A: Well, you know what? I tried to because -- at that time when I 
did the Florida, but, see -- that Florida -- when I told O.J., "Why 
don't you go move to Florida, and that would be your last chance 
of, you know, getting back together as a family." 
 
Q: Yes. So you tried that way --  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q:  -- with O.J., but you didn't try with Nicole. Right? 
 
A: Later on I did tell Nicole, "Why don't you move to Florida," 
you know. 
 
Q: And what did she say? 
 
A: She said, "I have my friends here." 
 
Q: Meaning you? 
 
A: Meaning me, meaning Faye, you know. She says she has 
friends here now. She didn't want to leave her friends. 
 
Q: Now, you told the officers that when Nicole gave -- excuse me -
-  when O.J. Simpson gave Nicole the expensive bracelet, quote, 
"To him this was his last chance to get back with Nicole," end of 
quotes. 
 
Would you like --  
 
A: This was what Nicole told -- what did you say? 
 
Q: Yeah. I am referring to your statement to -- your first police 
statement on 6-14. It says right here: "Nicole gave O.J. the bracelet 
back. This made O.J. angry. To him this was his last chance to get 
back with Nicole." 
 
Do you see that? Okay? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: How did you know that? 
 
 
A: That was just my assumption.  
 
Q: Who told you that? 
 
A: I thought at that time that was O.J.'s way of trying to reconcile 
and try and get Nicole back. 
 
Q: I see. Did you talk to O.J. about that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you spoke to O.J. about Nicole ending the relationship 
with him, what was his mood? 
 
A: When Nicole --  
 
Q: Yeah. When you spoke to O.J. in his office or on the telephone 
about Nicole ending the relationship with him, what was his 
mood? 
 
A: He was --  he was not -- they were not ending it. It's just that he 
was angry and upset because he didn't understand what was going 
on with Nicole. 
 
Q: What did he not understand? 
 
A: You know, the back and forth, back and forth, you know, "I 
want to go back" and then "I don't want to go back." 
 
Q: Nicole was initiating this back and forth --  
 
A: Exactly. 
 
Q: -- like a yo-yo. Right?  
 
A: Exactly. 
 
Q: It wasn't Mr. Simpson that was doing it. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Mr. Simpson didn't tell you that he dumped Nicole on 
Mother's Day, did he? 
 
A: He didn't. 
 
Q: He didn't tell you that. Right?  
 
A: I didn't know that. 
 
Q: Huh? 
 
A: I didn't know that. 
 
Q: I am not asking you if you know that from any source. I am 
asking you whether he told you that. 
 
A: He didn't tell me that. 
 
Q: And he didn't tell you that he dumped her the day after Mother's 
Day, did he?  
 
A: He didn't tell me that. 
 
Q: And he didn't tell you that it was he who decided to tell Nicole 
that he was ending the relationship once and for all. Correct? He 
didn't tell you that. Correct? 
 
A: No. See, I --  
 
Q: When he was complaining --   
 
A: -- never spoke to him. 
 
Q: What he was complaining --   
 
MR. BAKER: Let her answer. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: What he was complaining to you about was that Nicole kept 
going back and forth with him, and he didn't understand that and 
he was confused and it was making him upset. Correct? 
 
A: He was confused, yes, uh-huh.  
 
Q: Okay. And he wanted to have a relationship with Nicole. 
Correct? 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation.  
 
And why don't we let her answer. 
 
THE WITNESS: He was trying to see what -- if they could still get 
back together. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Yeah. That's what he told you. Right? 
 
A: But both of them wanted the relationship to work. 
 
 
Q: O.J. Simpson told you he wanted the relationship with Nicole to 
work when he talked to you in his office. Right? 
 
A: No. At the time he really was -- he says, you know, "Either we 
work it out or we don't work it out, but I" -- you know, he said, "I 
have another life here, Cora. I can't go on like this. Either" --  
 
Q: Can't go on like what? 
 
MR. BAKER: You stopped her again. 
 
THE WITNESS: The back and forth, the back and forth situation. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did you think that was unfair, what Nicole was doing to him? 
 
A: At that time Nicole even felt it that way, you know. She told 
me, "I guess I should just leave O.J. alone." 
 
Q: Did you tell that to O.J. Simpson, that Nicole had said that? 
 
A: Well, I told O.J. before, "Just give her some time. Give her 
some time. She's going through a phase in her life." I reassured him 
many times that "She loves you, and at some point in her time she 
wants to go back to you." 
 
Q: And what would he say in response to that? 
 
A: He said, you know, "Cora, I feel like a battered husband here. I 
don't know. 
I mean, I want to have my own life with Paula, and then here 
comes" --  "she wants to come back" -- you know, like, "I want to 
have my own life, and then when she sees that I have my own life, 
she comes back." He says, "What does she want? Tell me what she 
wants." 
 
Q: And what did you tell him? 
 
A: I told him, I said, "Give her some time. Give her some time." 
 
Q: And what did he say? 
 
A: He says, "I don't know what to do. What do we do here?" As he 
said, "I'm in the back nine. You're in the front nine." You know, 
"I'm 47 years old." 
 
Q: Did Mr. Simpson tell you that he was concerned about his age 
relative to Nicole's age? 
 
A: No. I think it was more so Nicole was concerned with her age 
because, as I told you before, she was worried about getting old, 
aging. 
 
Q: Did Mr. Simpson tell you that Nicole had told him, you know, 
"I'm going to be" -- "you're gonna be an old man and not" --  
 
A: Yeah, "You're gonna be an old man and you're still going to be 
able to find a 20-year-old. I'll be 50; nobody's gonna look at us," 
you know. 
 
Q: Did Mr. Simpson tell you that he felt like a battered husband? 
 
A: Yeah, he told me that. That was at the conversation in the 
office. In fact, even Nicole said, "God, gee," you know, "they feel 
they're battered husbands here," you know, so... 
 
Q: What was your reaction to his statement to you that he was a 
battered husband? 
 
A: At the time Nicole and I were thinking -- see, I guess what 
battered to me meant was emotionally, the back and forth. That's 
all. You know, Nicole bringing tapes and bringing muffins to O.J. 
and then, you know, "I want my family back," and then, "I don't 
want my family back. I still want to have the year off." I mean --  
 
MR. KELLY: Miss Fischman, I can't hear you. 
 
THE WITNESS: Oh, sorry. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did Mr. -- do you know why Mr. Simpson -- Withdrawn. 
 
Is that conversation with him in the office the last one you had with 
him? 
 
A: As far as I can recall, yes. Yes. 
 
Q: You said you saw him at the recital? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did he say to you at the recital? 
 
A: We didn't talk much. I actually -- when he -- he came, he kissed 
everybody, you know, Judy and Denise, you know, and then he sat 
back and I asked him, "You look tired," and he said that he's been 
all over. He was in New York, and he's gonna go to Chicago. He's 
gonna take a red eye to Chicago. 
 
Q: He told you all that at the time --  
 
A: Yeah, he said he's just tired, you know. 
 
 
Q: Did he have a tired expression on his face? 
 
A: Yes, he did look tired. 
 
Q: And he told you that he was going to be going to Chicago that 
night. Right? 
 
A: Yeah, he says, "I'm going to go take a red eye to Chicago." 
 
Q: And he made a point of telling you that. Right? 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation.  
 
THE WlTNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Okay. He said "red eye"? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where did he sit?  
 
A: What? 
 
Q: Where did he sit? 
 
A: Where -- behind me -- not behind me, but -- I would say the row 
behind me. 
 
Q: Where did he sit relative to Nicole? 
 
A: They were about four seats, three seats away from each other, 
because the kids were -- there were a lot of kids, too, in and out of 
that. We were trying to give room for the kids, too, so... They were 
four seats apart. 
 
Q: Did they speak to one another?  
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did you see them at all times, so that if they did speak, you 
would have known? 
 
A: No, because I was behind them. 
 
Q: Okay. What about during intermission or after the recital was 
over? Did you -- were you with one or the other of them the whole 
time? 
 
A: No, I didn't see them. I didn't see them talk. 
 
Q: Okay. So you don't know one way or the other whether they 
spoke to one another or had words. Correct? 
 
A: Right. Correct. 
 
Q: Did you talk to Nicole that evening? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Were you upset with her? 
 
A: No, I was not upset with her.  
 
Q: Why didn't you speak to her?  
 
A: Well, because at the time we were busy. She was -- she went to 
Mezzaluna; I went to Toscana, and then I figured the following day 
we were going to run together. 
 
See, we don't normally talk like that. We just automatically we call 
each other the following morning, and then that's when we talk. 
 
Q: Now, you had had a fight with Nicole the night before in fact --  
 
A: We didn't have a fight. 
 
Q:  -- correct? 
 
A: We didn't have a fight. 
 
Q: You had an argument on the phone the night before and in the 
morning of the 12th as well. Correct? 
 
A: No, I didn't talk to Nicole. 
 
Q: You had no conversation with her on the morning of the 12th?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You found out that your husband Ron had a conversation with 
Nicole on Saturday night, June 11. Right? 
 
A: Exactly, yes. 
 
Q: And Ron was looking for you. Right? 
 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you were out with a young man named Terrence? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Or Torrance?  
 
A: Terrence. 
 
Q: Terrance, with whom you were having an affair at that time. 
Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. BAKER: Irrelevant.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And you had asked Nicole to cover for you in the event that 
your husband had called. Right? 
 
MR. BAKER: This is irrelevant and invades the privacy interests 
of this witness. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Do you represent the witness? 
 
MR. BAKER: I am just putting my objection on the record, Mr. 
Petrocelli. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I know you would like to silence the witness, 
and I know you would like to hide this information --  
 
MR. BAKER: I don't think so. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: -- but the witness is ably represented by 
counsel. 
 
MR. BAKER: Do you want to mark that so Geraldo can find it 
easier? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: In fact, I think Geraldo's on real time, Mr. 
Baker, so it's probably already on the air. 
 
MR. BAKER: Perfect. 
 
THE WITNESS: It's coming out. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It's coming out.  
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah. 
 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You guys are obsessed with Geraldo. 
 
(Pending question read as follows: 
 
"Q. And you had asked Nicole to cover for you in the event that 
your husband had called. Right?") 
 
THE WITNESS: To cover? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Yes, to say that -- where you were. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: But not to tell Ron that you were with Terrence. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And Nicole and Ron had an argument about this because Nicole 
got frustrated that you were not at home with your children. 
 
A: I didn't know that. 
 
Q: But you found that out later. Right? 
 
A: Through Cici, yes. Yesterday. 
 
Q: You found that out yesterday? 
 
A: Well, no. From -- I know where the sources came. From Cici, 
yes. 
 
Q: What do you mean? When did you find this out? 
 
A: Found this out from Cici. 
 
Q: You spoke to Cici yesterday? 
 
A: No, no. I don't talk to her anymore. 
 
Q: What did you say about yesterday? I misunderstood you. 
 
A: Well, it was in the newspaper yesterday. 
 
Q: I see. 
 
 
A: About the testimony. 
 
Q: Okay. When did you find out that Ron and Nicole had had a 
phone call on the evening of June 11 about your whereabouts? 
 
A: My sister-in-law told me. 
 
Q: Who is your sister-in-law? 
 
A: My sister-in-law [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: And what is [Name Deleted]'s last name? 
 
A: Harraka. I mean [Name Deleted], my maiden name. [Name 
Deleted]. 
 
Q: [Name Deleted] is married to your brother? 
 
A: Exactly. 
 
Q: And [Name Deleted] lives where? 
 
A: In New Jersey. 
 
Q: What city? 
 
A: Clifton. 
 
Q: Okay. How did [Name Deleted] come to find this out? 
 
A: Because Ron called [Name Deleted] and told [Name Deleted] 
that she spoke to -- that 
she spoke to Ron. Ron was upset. 
 
Q: When did Ron call [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: Must be that evening, too. I don't know. 
 
Q: On June 11? 
 
A: Must be, yes. 
 
Q: And told [Name Deleted], your sister-in-law, that --  
 
A: "Where is she?" 
 
Q: "Where is Cora?"  
 
 
A: Exactly. 
 
Q: And when he called [Name Deleted], where was [Name 
Deleted] at that time? 
 
A: [Name Deleted] was at her house. 
 
Q: In Clifton, New Jersey? 
 
A: Clifton, New Jersey. 
 
Q: And Ron called Clifton, New Jersey, looking for you? 
 
A: Asking where I was. 
 
Q: Okay. You want to pass a note to -- at the behest of your client, 
Mr. Simpson? 
 
MR. BAKER: Excuse me? Are you speaking to me? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Are you passing a note to Mr. -- Miss 
Fischman's lawyer? 
 
MR. BAKER: No. You are very paranoid today, Dan. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You're making me paranoid. 
 
THE WITNESS: I just want to know what's the relevance of this 
with Nicole and O.J.'s --  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: It's extremely relevant.  
 
A: Why? It has nothing --   
 
Q: It has to go with bias against Nicole, other among other things. 
 
A: No, but there was nothing -- you know, my personal life has 
nothing to do with what happened to Nicole. 
 
MR. BAKER: That's exactly right. This is entirely irrelevant. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't think it's fair for you to even know my 
personal life. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: We will let the court decide that. 
 
A: My marital problem had nothing to do with their -- whatever 
happened to them. 
 
Q: Obviously it did when your husband --  
 
A: But I just want to put it on record. 
 
Q: -- when your husband and Nicole are having a conversation 
about your whereabouts within hours of her murder. 
 
A: Exactly. 
 
Q: Okay. So I am entitled to probe, and I intend to, and I intend to 
ask your husband about all this as well. 
 
MR. BAKER: Beyond the scope of anything relevant. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You found out from [Name Deleted] when about Ron 
Fischman's telephone call with Nicole? 
 
A: Well, the same week. I talk to my sister-in-law every day. 
 
Q: Did you find out the next morning before Nicole's death? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you know as of the time of the recital that Ron had spoken 
to Nicole? 
 
A: By the time of the recital --  
 
Q: Right. 
 
A: -- that Ron had spoken to Nicole. I didn't know. I don't know. I 
didn't know. 
 
Q: Did Ron tell you? 
 
A: Ron and I were not talking. 
 
Q: Did you see Ron before the recital? 
 
A: Yes, because we went to take the kids to the recital. We even all 
went out to dinner to Toscana. 
 
Q: Okay. And you went with your children --  
 
A: Yes. 
 
 
Q:  -- and with Ron. And with anyone else? 
 
A: That's it. 
 
Q: And before the recital -- Well, withdrawn. At the recital -- at the 
dinner -- excuse me -- with Ron, did he tell you about his phone 
call with Nicole? 
 
A: At the recital? 
 
Q: At the dinner. 
 
A: At the dinner? 
 
Q: After the recital. 
 
A: Did Ron --  
 
Q: Tell you that he had spoken to Nicole --  
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  -- the night before? 
 
A: No, we didn't talk about that. 
 
Q: Okay. So prior to Nicole's death, you had no knowledge 
whatsoever that Nicole and Ron had spoken. 
 
A: Exactly. 
 
Q: Okay. And you did not talk to Nicole at any time the next 
morning, on the 12th, correct, after your evening with Terrence? 
 
MR. KRAMER: You're talking about Sunday morning. Right? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
Q: Is that what you're saying? 
 
A: Yeah, I went to Terrence's house because I was afraid of Ron 
because Ron was mad, and I didn't want to go home. That's why. 
 
Q: So you spent the evening of June 11 --  
 
MR. BAKER: This is irrelevant. 
 
 
THE WITNESS: This is not to have an affair is what you're saying. 
To me, I went there because I was afraid of my husband. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Okay. So you spent the evening at the home of Terrence on 
June 11. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you return to your home the next day, Sunday? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What time? 
 
A: I don't know. I don't remember.  
 
Q: Before noon? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And when you got home, did you and your husband have 
any discussion or conversation? 
 
A: No. We were not talking anymore.  
 
Q: Not at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. And when you got to the recital, did you guys drive 
together in the same car? 
 
MR. BAKER: This is irrelevant and could very --  
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember. 
 
MR. BAKER: -- well be violative of the spousal privilege. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You may answer. Did you drive together? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
 
Q: Okay. And when you were at the recital, did you speak to your 
husband at all? 
 
A: Yeah, we spoke. I even told him to take the pictures of Sydney 
and O.J. 
 
Q: Why did you tell him to do that?  
 
A: Well, because, you know, I thought it would be nice to have a 
father and son picture because Nicole -- Sydney looked so cute in 
that. 
 
Q: Because Nicole wasn't talking to O.J., and you knew that Nicole 
wasn't going to take that picture. 
 
A: No, you're putting words in my mouth. No, I --  
 
Q: True? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You knew that Nicole was extremely upset with Mr. Simpson 
on the evening of that recital. Right? 
 
MR. BAKER: Badgering and leading.  
 
THE WITNESS: I didn't know that. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You knew that if you didn't see that that picture was taken, it 
never would have been taken by anyone else. True? 
 
MR. BAKER: Same. 
 
THE WITNESS: Well, I asked Ron to take the picture. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And at no time did you ask Nicole to take the picture. Right? 
 
A: Because Nicole at that time wasn't even there. She was running 
around. She had her own camera. I don't know where she was. She 
was back and forth. You know, the recital, we were back and forth, 
in the backstage, you know, back -- I mean, there were a lot of 
kids. 
 
Q: You didn't talk to Nicole at all. Right? 
 
A: We said hello. I mean, I noticed the dress. 
 
 
Q: You didn't talk to her other than say hello? 
 
A: We said hello. We were standing in line. Just "Hi." "Hi." Nicole 
and I don't talk that often. We always talk when we run. I mean, it's 
not like -- you know, we see each other most of the time, so... 
 
Q: So it's your testimony that --  
 
A: It's like we see each other every day --  
 
Q: -- there was no conflict or tension between the two of you that 
evening? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: None at all. 
 
A: We were like sisters, yeah. I mean, we probably had a little 
disagreement, but, you know, we just don't --  
 
Q: Did you have a disagreement? 
 
A: No, we didn't have a -- I said we probably -- sometimes we have 
a disagreement, but we leave each other alone, you know. We don't 
fight or anything like that. 
 
Q: Did you ever tell anyone that the last six weeks Nicole and you 
had a falling-out? 
 
A: The last six weeks? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: I didn't say "falling-out," but it's gotten to the point where we 
were -- Nicole was spending more time and time with Faye, and at 
the time I was seeing Terrence. 
 
Q: And isn't it true that you said that the last two months you felt 
like you were not there for Nicole? 
 
A: Yeah, I felt -- yeah, at that time I was -- I felt, you know, I 
should have been there for her. 
 
Q: So your relationship with Nicole cooled in the last six weeks of 
her life. Correct? 
 
A: No, I wouldn't say "cooled," because we still saw each other. 
 
Q: Do you deny telling Michael Viner and the National Enquirer 
that your relationship -- that you had a falling-out in your 
relationship the last two months? 
 
A: I don't think that's true. That's not -- I don't consider that falling 
out. 
 
Q: So if you said that, you were lying? 
 
A: If I was lying? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't think I was lying. I was confused. There 
was a lot of confusion at the time. I was trying to understand what 
was going on with Nicole. I don't think I was lying. I was 
confused, yes, but not lying. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You were confused when you talked to Michael Viner and the 
National Enquirer? 
 
A: I was confused? 
 
Q: Is that what you're telling us, you were confused when you 
talked to them? 
 
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. Argumentative. Let me think 
up some other ones. Okay. 
 
THE WITNESS: I was confused? Yeah, I would say I was 
confused, yeah. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You're -- are you confused now?  
 
MR. KRAMER: Think about that question. 
 
THE WITNESS: If I'm confused now?  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Are you confused now?  
 
A: About what? 
 
Q: About your testimony.  
 
A: No, I don't consider it.  
 
Q: Are you on any medication today?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You are under no drugs or medication that would affect your 
ability to testify? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: Say no to drugs. 
 
Q: Or any kind of prescription medicine? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, one of the reasons your relationship with Nicole 
cooled is because you were seeing this fellow Terrence, and she 
was -- didn't approve of that. True? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Well, no. See, I didn't approve of what she was 
doing, too. She was seeing Faye more and more, and I told her, "I 
don't like Faye." They were going out a lot, and I didn't like the 
fact that they were going to different clubs. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Well, how do you know how much they were going out? 
 
A: Because she told me. She said, "Do you want to come with us? 
We're going to the Whiskey bar." I said, "No, I don't want to do 
that." 
 
Q: What time period are we talking about? 
 
A: Well, that's the last -- that's after Cabo, after Puerto -- you 
know, around that time, May. 
 
Q: May of 1994? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Okay. And you don't know how much they were going out, do 
you? You weren't with them. 
 
A: No, I wasn't with them, but also they were -- when I would call 
her, I said, "Where are you going?" 
 
And she said, "Oh, Faye and I are just going to hang out at home." 
 
Q: And you were seeing this fellow Terrence during this time 
period. Right? 
 
 
MR. BAKER: Irrelevant. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes, I was seeing him. I was going out to lunch 
with him, yeah. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You were having an affair with him. Right? 
 
MR. BAKER: Irrelevant, invasion of her privacy interests. 
 
THE WITNESS: An affair, I don't consider an affair. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: A sexual relationship with Terrence. 
 
MR. BAKER: Completely irrelevant.  
 
THE WITNESS: At the time --  
 
MR. KRAMER: You have -- let me take a moment with the 
witness. 
 
Actually, is this a good time to break for the evening? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, not when we have a question pending. 
 
Q: Answer the question. 
 
A: Well, let's just continue. What? I mean --  
 
Q: Answer the question. 
 
MR. BAKER: This is totally irrelevant. I think she has testified she 
has current divorce proceedings. I don't know the impact of those, 
but it doesn't relate to this litigation. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You may answer. You were having a sexual relationship with 
Nicole during the month of May --  
 
A: With Nicole, no, I was not having a sexual relationship with 
Nicole. 
 
Q:  -- with Terrence during the month of May of 1994. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
 
Q: And Nicole did not approve of it, and she told you that. 
Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And she thought that it would ruin your family. Correct? 
 
A: No, she didn't say that. She said that, "Be careful because Ron 
might find out." 
 
Q: And if --  
 
A: And I said to her, "You have to watch out with what you're 
doing," because at that time she was doing this threesome and she 
was having a lesbian affair with Faye, and I didn't approve of that. 
So that was what was happening. 
 
So Terrence became my friend and my confidante at the time. 
That's why I became close to Terrence. 
 
Q: And you slept at Terrence's home on the evening of June 11. 
Correct? 
 
A: That a Saturday? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Saturday night. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: At a time when you were still having a romantic affair with 
him. Right? 
 
A: I think I was at home. It could be -- I don't know. Probably, yes. 
Oh, yes. 
 
Q: This is the night when your husband was calling Nicole. 
 
A: Yes, because we attend a wedding and he's going -- you know, I 
was afraid of him, so I went to Terrence. I said, you know. "I don't 
want to go home." 
 
Q: Now, you said that Nicole didn't approve of what you were 
doing, and you didn't approve of what Nicole was doing. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: But you don't really know what Nicole was doing. You had one 
conversation with her --  
 
A: Well, she told me --  
 
Q: Excuse me. You testified that you had one conversation --  
 
MR. BAKER: That was a very major interruption. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I didn't ask her a question. 
 
MR. BAKER: Oh, you didn't? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: Oh. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You told me earlier that you only had one conversation with 
Nicole in which she mentioned this incident regarding --  
 
A: Yes. She told me that over --  
 
MR. KRAMER: Let him finish his question. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And she didn't tell you that this was an ongoing thing with 
Faye. 
 
A: Well, at that time I assumed it was an ongoing thing because 
she said that she did it with Brett three times, so -- and Faye was 
there a lot on Bundy, so I assumed that they were doing it. 
 
Q: That was your assumption, right, that --  
 
A: Faye confirmed it to me. 
 
Q: Oh, Faye told --  
 
A: After -- when Nicole died, she confirmed it to me that, yes, she 
was, and she was embarrassed about the whole thing. 
 
Q: Faye confirmed to you that she was having a romantic 
relationship with Nicole on multiple occasions? 
 
A: Not on multiple occasions --  
 
Q: More than once? 
 
A: -- but she did say that she had an affair with Nicole. 
 
 
Q: More than one incident? 
 
A: I don't know when they -- I don't know about that. 
 
Q: Is it your testimony that Faye told you that there was more than 
one incident? 
 
MR. BAKER: Badgering, argumentative. You're killing Dave --  
 
THE WITNESS: More than once? 
 
MR. BAKER: -- by stepping on her answers. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I certainly don't want to do that. 
 
THE WITNESS: You know what? I wasn't there, so -- I wasn't 
there. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  
 
Q: So you don't know. 
 
MR. BAKER: Objection  
 
THE WITNESS: I only -- I'm telling you only what Faye told me 
and what Nicole told me. So I don't know how many times they 
did. I mean, they didn't call me every time they did it, so... 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Under oath here you are testifying that you are assuming that 
Nicole and Faye had an ongoing lesbian relationship. Is that what 
you're telling us? 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. 
 
THE WlTNESS: Yes, because Faye was there almost every day. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: What days was Faye there, Miss Fischman? 
 
A: What days?  
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: I don't remember, but every time I would go upstairs -- every 
time I would go there when we would go out for a run, Faye was 
upstairs sleeping. 
 
Q: Give me the days that she was there. Can you name them? 
 
 
A: Oh, I don't remember.  
 
Q: Give me the weeks. 
 
A: Oh, I don't remember. 
 
Q: So you can't tell us a single day that Faye Resnick was sleeping 
over at Nicole's house. 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: Faye and I -- I mean Nicole and I ran at least 
three or four times a day, so I assume every time I was there, she 
was there. I mean, in fact even -- she even called us upstairs, Cici 
and I. She says, you know, "Go upstairs and look where Faye is." 
 
I said, "Where is she?" 
 
"She's sleeping. " And Nicole said, "Doesn't she look cute?" and 
Cici and I look at each other. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: But you don't have any knowledge about how many nights she 
slept over at Nicole's house. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: Well, I know she didn't have a place because Christian threw 
her out of the house, so she was finding a place to... 
 
Q: You were having a severe conflict with your husband Ron 
during the period of May and June of 1994. In fact, you weren't 
talking to each other, you said. Correct? 
 
MR. BAKER: Irrelevant. 
 
THE WITNESS: Ron and I have been having problems for the last 
six years. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Including during that time frame. Right? 
 
A: Including that time, yes. 
 
Q: And you were under great stress during that time period. Right? 
 
A: I wouldn't say "great stress." 
 
Q: No? Not under any stress? 
 
MR. BAKER: You're switching your question. Great stress the 
first time. Just stress the second time. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  
 
Q: You may answer. 
 
A: It wasn't great stress. I mean, you know, I was very unhappy 
with my husband, so... 
 
Q: Were you taking any medication or drugs at that time? 
 
A: No, I don't do drugs. 
 
Q: Were you taking Xanax?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was Nicole taking Xanax?  
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Was Faye taking it?  
 
A: No, I don't know. 
 
Q: Do you know that your husband was prescribing Xanax to your 
friends and his friends?  
 
A: No, that's -- I don't think so. 
 
Q: You understand that a pill vial of Xanax was found in Mr. 
Simpson's luggage. Right? 
 
A: See, I don't know that. 
 
Q: You never heard that before? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You never heard that a Xanax prescription made out to Naomi 
Fischman, who was Ron's mother, correct --  
 
A: Yeah, Naomi. yeah. 
 
 
Q: -- was found in Mr. Simpson's possession when he was 
arrested? 
 
A: I don't know, so... 
 
Q: Is it your testimony that you have no knowledge of Mr. -- of 
your husband, Mr. Fischman, providing Xanax to your friends and 
his friends? Is that your testimony? 
 
A: Well, you know --  
 
Q: Can you answer that yes or no? 
 
A: Could you repeat the question again? 
 
Q: Yes. Is it your testimony that you have no knowledge that your 
husband, Ron Fischman, was providing Xanax to your friends and 
his friends? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You have no such knowledge?  
 
A: Yes, I didn't know that, so... 
 
Q: You don't? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you know whether Nicole had access to Xanax in her 
house? 
 
A: I didn't know that, no. 
 
Q: Do you know whether Mr. Simpson did? 
 
A: No, I didn't know that. 
 
Q: Have you ever seen your husband or learned about your 
husband giving Xanax to Nicole? 
 
A: No, I don't know that.  
 
Q: To Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: I don't know that. 
 
Q: Or to Faye Resnick?  
 
A: I don't know that. 
 
 
Q: Do you know how Xanax in the name of Naomi Fischman got 
in Mr. Simpson's possession?  
 
A: I don't know what happened there. I don't know. 
 
Q: Do you have any explanation for that? 
 
A: I don't know. I didn't even know that. 
 
Q: You are just finding that out today? 
 
A: Well, you're telling me, yes. 
 
Q: Mr. Simpson didn't tell you --  
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  -- in your long talks together?  
 
A: No. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Is this a convenient spot to break? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
MR. KELLY: Not for the day, is it? Is that what we're talking 
about? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I thought you just meant a break. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Oh, I thought you originally said we were going 
to go -- I'm an hour early. I must be on some other time. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: We can take a short break here, though. 
 
MR. KRAMER: ActuaUy, I was just going to get a jump on 
traffic. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let's take a short break. Give the reporter a 
rest. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the 
time is approximately 3:46. 
 
(Recess.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 4:02. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
 
Q: When was the last time you spoke to Nicole before she died? 
 
A: Before she died? At the recital when we said hello. 
 
Q: Anything else besides hello? 
 
A: Well, the night -- this day before we talked about the rehearsal, 
you know, that she was going to take my kids to the rehearsal. 
 
Q: When was that conversation? 
 
A: That was Saturday morning that she was gonna do that and put 
the kids' makeup and everything like that and take them to the 
rehearsal. 
 
Q: And did she do so?  
 
A: Yes, she did. 
 
Q: Was that a telephone call?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you talk about anything else? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she tell that you Mr. Simpson was coming to the recital? 
 
A: No, we didn't talk about that. 
 
Q: Did you know that he was coming? 
 
A: I didn't even think about it. I didn't ask, so I don't know. 
 
Q: So you did not go to the rehearsal.  
 
A: I didn't go to the rehearsal because I went to a wedding with 
Ron.  
 
Q: Whose wedding? 
 
A: Our friend's daughter's wedding.  
 
Q: Friend's daughter's wedding. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
 
Q: What's the name of this bride?  
 
A: [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: Last name is what?  
 
A: [Name Deleted].  
 
Q: Now, reading from your statement to Michael Viner, et al., 
concerning the recital, you said: 
 
"Nicole was in the back with Justin. O.J. was like all the way in the 
back and he was -- he was -- he looked you know, so tired and 
really -- hc felt so sad because the whole family was there. And, 
um, I actually, um, told Ron at that time I was going to take a 
picture of Sydney and Justin and Sydney and O.J. That picture has 
been -- everybody wanted that picture to the point where Shapiro 
wanted it, Marcia Clark wanted it, but that was the -- that was the 
last picture." Okay. Do you recall making those statements? 
 
A: Yeah, that was the last picture, yes. 
 
Q: Were all the statements that I just read statements that you 
made? 
 
A: Yes, I made them. 
 
Q: And were they all true to the best of your knowledge? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Including the statement that O.J. looked "so tired"? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And that O.J. "felt so sad"? 
 
A: Well, from -- I mean, you could see -- tired and sad is -- I felt 
bad too, because at the time, too, Ron and I were fighting, so it was 
a manifestation of my feeling of loneliness, too. 
 
Q: You feel some reason to withdraw from your statement that O.J. 
felt sad that evening? 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You seem like you have trouble now owning up to the fact that 
you said that. 
 
A: Well, when I looked at him, he did look sad because he was all 
the way at the corner. 
 
 
Q: Thank you. He looked sad. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Thank you. 
 
A: Tired and sad. 
 
Q: And you know that he didn't go out with his family that night. 
Right? 
 
A: I didn't know that. 
 
Q: He wasn't sitting with his family. Right? 
 
A: No, he wasn't. 
 
Q: Did you -- You did not know that -- where he went after he left 
the recital? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Are you asking if she knew then --  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: At the time. At the time. 
 
MR. KRAMER: -- or if she knows now? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: At the time. 
 
THE WITNESS: At the time, no. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did you ask Nicole, "Where are you going" --  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- that evening at the recital? 
 
A: They said they were going to go to Mezzaluna. 
 
Q: Did they invite you and your family to come along? 
 
A: No, because it was the whole family, and then we were going to 
go separate families. 
 
Q: Did you understand that Mr. Simpson was going with Nicole 
and the rest of the family to Mezzaluna? 
 
A: I didn't even think of that. 
 
Q: Did you have an understanding as to whether or not he was 
going with them? 
 
A: I assumed. 
 
Q: You assumed what? 
 
A: That they were going to go. 
 
Q: That Mr. Simpson was going also.  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. You've never told anyone about that assumption before. 
Correct? 
 
A: I'm just telling you now. I mean...  
 
Q: You didn't tell the police officers that, did you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: But you knew that Nicole and Mr. Simpson were having a 
severe conflict at that time --  
 
MR. BAKER: Leading.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  
 
Q: -- about the IRS and about the conversation concerning buying 
Nicole's friends and taking Nicole's friends. Correct? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading and vague.  
 
THE WITNESS: Correct, yeah. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: So why would you assume that they were going out together 
that evening? 
 
A: Because their family -- their children came first. It's like Ron 
and I, you know, no matter how big fighting we had, we still did 
for the kids. 
 
Q: Nicole never told you that she was going out with Mr. Simpson 
that evening. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or that she would be inviting him to dinner. Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And on Saturday when you spoke about the rehearsal, did you 
also talk about dinner plans on Sunday evening after the recital? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, the next day after Nicole's death was June 13. 
Correct?  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you were at your house with Ron Fischman and, for a time, 
Cici Shahian. Right?  
 
A: June 13?  
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Cici wasn't there.  
 
Q: At no time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: At no time the rest of that week after Nicole's death were you 
with Ron and Cynthia Shahian? 
 
A: Ron --  
 
Q: Ron, your husband, and Cynthia Shahian? 
 
A: I don't remember. She was in and out of our house at the time. 
 
Q: So there was a time --  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- when she was in your house. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you ever speak to your husband Ron about his 
conversation with O.J. Simpson that evening? 
 
 
A: No, because Ron and I were not talking. 
 
Q: Not at all? 
 
A: We would talk about kids, but -- we talked, but we didn't -- we 
weren't talking about those things because he was mad at me and I 
was mad at him, so... 
 
Q: So that evening at dinner he didn't say anything to you about 
Mr. Simpson's conduct or demeanor? 
 
MR. KRAMER: This is the Sunday night? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Sunday evening, correct. 
 
THE WITNESS: Sunday night, no.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And the next day after you found out Nicole had been 
murdered, did you and Ron Fischman talk about Nicole's death? 
 
A: Of course we did. We were saddened by it. 
 
Q: And did you talk about who was responsible for it? 
 
A: We were confused. We were like -- it's just, "What happened?" 
We were afraid to speak. 
 
Q: Privately to each other, did you talk to each other about what 
had happened to Nicole the next day when you found out? 
 
A: What had happened?  
 
Q: Yes.  
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: And did you and Ron discuss whether Mr. Simpson killed 
Nicole?  
 
A: We thought about it, yes. 
 
Q: And you talked about it. Right?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what did Ron Fischman tell you about that? 
 
 
A: What did Ron Fischman?  
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Well, the same thing that I was -- we were talking about, you 
know, how they were trying to work things out and it didn't work 
out. "What happened?" you know. 
 
Q: Did Ron tell you about his conversations with Mr. Simpson at 
the recital -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- that next day?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Isn't it true that Ron told you and Cynthia Shahian that 
O.J. Simpson said to him that evening that he would get evening -- 
he would get even with Nicole, that he's not done with her yet? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  
 
Q: Isn't it true that you were told that? 
 
A: That's not true. 
 
Q: You deny that? 
 
A: He didn't tell me. 
 
Q: Didn't he tell you and Miss Shahian words to that effect? 
  
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: You know, I don't remember, you know, so I 
don't know.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: So if your husband would testify to that, would you say he'd be 
Iying?  
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative.  
 
THE WITNESS: He'd be lying? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Yes, if he testifies to that, would he be lying? Yes or no. 
 
A: l don't know if he said that. He didn't tell me. So if he said that, 
yes, he would be lying, because I didn't -- he didn't tell me. 
 
Q: And if Cynthia Shahian testifies that your husband said that to 
you and her, would she be lying? 
 
A: Well, I don't know Cynthia, you know. 
 
Q: You don't know her? 
 
A: Well, not now. I don't know that woman anymore. 
 
Q: You're upset with her? 
 
A: No, I'm not upset with her. It's just that she has sold a lot of 
stories about my girlfriend, and I'm very upset with that. 
 
Q: So you're not -- you don't have a relationship with her anymore. 
Right? 
 
A: Not anymore. 
 
Q: And at one time she used to be your friend. Right? 
 
A: I thought she was, but she really wasn't my friend. She was just 
being friendly with me because I was Nicole's friend. 
 
Q: And after Nicole died your friendship stopped? 
 
A: No. Actually she was calling me every day and wanting to be 
friends with me, and my sister [Name Deleted] said, "Just be 
careful, you know, these people are getting information from you." 
You know, "Don't trust them." 
 
Q: And you're upset with Cynthia because she has profited from 
the exploitation of Nicole's death? 
 
A: No. She has said things that weren't true. 
 
Q: Didn't you say that she has sold her story to many people, or 
words to that effect? 
 
A: That's what I heard, because all the things I told her, it was 
coming out in the tabloid. That's why the Browns thought I was the 
one selling it to the tabloids. 
 
Q: So you think Cynthia Shahian has been selling stories to the 
tabloids? 
 
A: I thought so, too, yes. 
 
Q: Do you know that for a fact? 
 
A: Michael Viner told me. 
 
Q: And what did Michael tell you? 
 
A: Cynthia and Candice Garvey. 
 
Q: Have been selling stories to the tabloids? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: For money?  
 
A: I assume. 
 
Q: Did he tell you that it was for money? 
 
A: He told me that Candice Garvey made a hundred thousand 
dollars. 
 
Q: For doing what? 
 
A: For giving information. 
 
Q: To whom? 
 
A: To the tabloid. 
 
Q: Does that bother you, that she would do so? 
 
A: It doesn't -- it bothers me, yes. 
 
Q: That she would make money? 
 
A: No, not the money issue. It's giving information to the people 
that -- it's invasion of privacy. I mean, you know, my girlfriend's 
dead. Why would you even tell the whole world what happened to 
her, you know, her private life. 
 
Q: So it bothered you that Candice Garvey was telling tabloids 
things about Nicole's private life? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And that's not something you would ever do. Right? 
 
A: I wouldn't want to do that. I mean, you know, you paint a 
picture of... 
 
Q: And how much did Cynthia Shahian get? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Do you know if she got a dime? 
 
A: What? 
 
Q: Do you know if she got even one dime? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: So you don't have any information that she got even one cent 
for selling information or providing information to tabloids. 
Correct? 
 
A: I would say correct then. 
 
Q: But yet you have no further relationship with her or friendship 
at all with her. Right? 
 
A: Well, they all betrayed me. They don't talk to me anymore. 
 
Q: How did she betray you? 
 
A: How? When I was having problems when I...When I did my 
suicide attempt, she was the only one there and Ron and my kids 
and Terrence, and then three months after it was in the headline of 
National Enquirer and Star. 
 
Q: And you assumed that Miss Shahian --  
 
A: Because she was the ony one there. 
 
Q: But there were other people there. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Did you ask her if she provided the information? 
 
A: I just heard from other people that she was -- she felt so bad that 
she did it. 
 
Q: She felt so bad about what? 
 
A: That she told the tabloid. 
 
 
Q: Have you asked her if she did so? 
 
A: I don't know because I don't -- I can't reach her. 
 
Q: Do you know where she works? 
 
A: No. She works for Michael Viner. 
 
Q: Have you tried calling her? 
 
A: No. Why should I. 
 
Q: But you assume she told the tabloids about your suicide 
attempt. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And for that reason you're unhappy with her. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did --  
 
A: I never disgraced them, you know. I never told their private 
lives. 
 
Q: When was your suicide attempt? 
 
A: In October. 
 
Q: 1994? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What was the reason for that? 
 
MR. BAKER: Irrelevant. 
 
THE WITNESS: I was just overwhelmed by everything. The 
media was after me, my marital problem, my children, you know, 
couldn't even take care of my kids because of the media; every 
week there were stories of Nicole, and I felt like I wanted to 
control this. I couldn't control it. 
 
And I was getting pressure from the Browns, "You can't talk to" -- 
"you have to speak in behalf of Nicole," you know. And then the 
friends are saying, you know, "You can't talk to the Simpson. You 
can only talk to the Brown." 
 
So the pressure was too much, it was overwhelming, and then 
media was always after me, you know, "Do this. Do that. You can't 
say this. You can't say that," and... 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And how did you attempt suicide? 
 
MR. BAKER: Totally irrelevant. Clearly invades this witness' right 
of privacy. 
 
THE WITNESS: I think I was in so much pain, I was -- I took 
Tylenol. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Okay. How many? 
 
A: 24 -- you know, it's like a bottle.  
 
Q: Took a whole bottle full? 
 
A: Half that in the evening, because I thought that that would -- my 
pain would go away, and then the other half. 
 
Q: And isn't it true that Cynthia Shahian helped revive you and --  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  -- and helped save your life, didn't she? 
 
A: Yes. I actually was the one -- I called her. I said, "You know 
what? I need your help. I took" -- "took something. I want you to 
be here for my kids." 
 
And she said, "What did you do?" And so she helped me. 
 
Q: Okay. And she helped you through that. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And she helped get you medical treatment. Right? 
 
A: No, she -- that was it. And then from then on, she didn't --  
 
Q: When you say "that was it," what do you mean, "that was it"? 
 
A: I mean she helped me to -- yeah, she helped me through the 
medical treatment, yes. 
 
Q: You were taken to an emergency room. Correct? 
 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And your husband Ron was there also. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And Cynthia called him there. Right? 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Not Cynthia caUed. Ron called home --  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And Cynthia told him to come home right away. Right? 
 
A: Exactly. 
 
Q: And how long were you in the hospital? 
 
A: Five days, four days. 
 
Q: And did you get any treatment after you got out of the hospital? 
 
MR. BAKER: Irrelevant. 
 
THE WITNESS: A treatment?  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Medical treatment.  
 
A: Yeah, I was seeing a psychologist.  
 
Q: Barry Michaels? 
 
A: No, not Barry Michaels. 
 
Q: Were you taking medication?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you taken any psychiatric medication? 
 
A: No. 
 
 
Q: When was the last time you spoke to Mr. Simpson before 
today? 
 
A: When was the last time? That was Sunday when we went to -- 
with -- the kids were there.  
 
Q: To his home?  
 
A: I went to pick up the kids, yeah.  
 
Q: Have you slept at the Rockingham residence at all --   
 
MR. BAKER: Irrelevant.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q:  -- since --  
 
A: Have I slept where? 
 
Q: At the Rockingham residence. 
 
MR. KRAMER: You are talking about the Simpson residence? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah. 
 
Q: Mr. Simpson's Rockingham residence --  
 
A: No, never. 
 
Q:  -- since his release from jail.  
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: Do you have any photographs of Mr. Simpson in your 
possession other than the ones that you brought here today? 
 
A: That's it. 
 
Q: What about in your boxes of -- at home and your private 
personal belongings, do you have any photographs of him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: None at all? 
 
A: Well, I do have pictures, but pretty much that and, you know -- 
I mean, I can look. I mean, I'm sure I have pictures. 
 
Q: Have you given Mr. Simpson any photographs since he's been 
released from jail? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you given any of his representatives any photographs7 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Have you been asked to provide any photographs? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you given him any materials? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And have you been asked to? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you ever recall Mr. Simpson wearing Bruno Magli shoes? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know what they are? 
 
A: I know what a Bruno Magli shoe is. 
 
Q: You do? 
 
A: I mean --  
 
Q: A men's shoe? 
 
A: No, no. I know --  
 
Q: And you wouldn't know whether he was wearing them or not. 
Correct? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Correct? 
 
A: Correct, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. You saw pictures of those shoes at the criminal trial, did 
you not? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You did not? 
 
A: (Shakes head.) 
 
Q: Did you see pictures of those gloves that were alleged to be the 
gloves the killer wore? Did you see those gloves?  
 
A: Actual?  
 
Q: Yeah. Did you see --   
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- them on television?  
 
A: On television? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Are you asking about pictures of the bloody 
gloves? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
THE WITNESS: I saw, yeah.  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did you ever see Mr. Simpson wear gloves like that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever see him wear any gloves? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. You knew about this incident where Mr. Simpson was 
looking in at Nicole having sex with [Name Deleted]. Right? 
 
A: I'm sorry. What? 
 
Q: You knew about this incident when Mr. Simpson was looking 
in while Nicole was having sex with [Name Deleted] at the Gretna 
Green apartment? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
 
Q: And you knew about that because Nicole told you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what did she tell you exactly? 
 
A: That O.J. saw them do it. That was it. 
 
Q: And how did she know O.J. saw them? 
 
A: Because O.J. apparently told --  confronted them that day or that 
following day. I don't know, but... 
 
Q: Nicole related this to you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what did she say that -- about O.J. confronting her and 
Keith the next day? 
 
A: That was it. She just said, "O.J. caught us." As far as I can 
remember, that's pretty much --  
 
Q: Did she tell you what O.J. said to Keith and her the next day --  
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  -- after O.J. caught them? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Nothing at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And this was during the period of time when Nicole had split 
from O.J.? 
 
A: Yeah, that was on Gretna Green yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. And during this period of time Mr. Simpson would call 
you frequently to find out about Nicole's whereabouts. Correct? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. Vague as to the term "frequently." 
 
THE WITNESS: Nicole -- no. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  
 
Q: You deny that? 
 
A: Pretty much where -- how Nicole was doing, what's on her 
mind, yeah. 
 
Q: But not where is she and who is she dating? 
 
A: No. I don't remember. I don't think -- see, Nicole told O.J. 
 
Q: Yeah, but I am not asking about that. Is it true that O.J. would 
call you frequently to ask you what is Nicole up to? 
 
A: Yes. That's exactly, yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. What is she up to. Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you would tell him what Nicole was up to. Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And you understood that Mr. Simpson was very jealous at that 
time in his life in reference to Nicole. Right? 
 
MR.BAKER: Speculation and leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Okay. And at that -- You were in a restaurant, in fact, with 
Nicole when -- at Toscana's when --  
 
A: Toscana? 
 
Q: Do you recall that incident? 
 
A: Well, if you rehash me. I don't remember --  
 
Q: Do you recall an incident when you were in a restaurant with 
Nicole and O.J. Simpson at a restaurant called Toscana's? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: When Mr. Simpson got very jealous about another man? 
 
A: Oh, see, I wasn't there. We came late. They were -- I wasn't 
there at the time. We came in for dessert at that time. 
 
Q: So you --  
 
A: So I didn't see that. 
 
Q: You didn't see the incident?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you hear about it?  
 
A: Nicole told me. 
 
Q: And what did Nicole tell you? 
 
A: She was first a little bit embarrassed and said that, you know -- I 
don't know who was there, so I don't even remember who was 
there because I wasn't there. We came late. Ron and I came late. 
 
Q: She was embarrassed about what?  
 
A: That the guy was there. 
 
Q: Alessandro? 
 
A: Yeah, Alejandro [sic]. 
 
Q: Did she tell you what O.J. Simpson's reaction was to seeing 
Alessandro there? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: You don't remember?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. And were you with Nicole and Mr. Simpson at a 
restaurant called Tryst with Nicole when Mr. Simpson was also 
there? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And did you observe Mr. Simpson's behavior towards Nicole on 
that evening? 
 
A: They were friendly. They said hello. 
 
Q: Okay. Was there any sign of jealousy on his part that evening? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: None at all?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And you've never told anybody that. Correct? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay. You don't recall?  
 
A: I don't recall, no. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, how often would O.J. Simpson call you when 
Nicole and he were separated in 1992 to 1993?  
 
A: How often? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Not that often.  
 
Q: Once a week?  
 
A: No, not really.  
 
Q: How often? 
 
A: I don't know. Once a month, once every three weeks. It wasn't 
really --  it wasn't that often. 
 
Q: It wasn't very often?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And so if you told someone that it was often, you weren't telling 
the truth. Correct? 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, I probably used the wrong word. So I'm 
not --  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
 
Q: So rethinking that, you would like -- your memory now is that 
Mr. Simpson did not ask you often what Nicole was up to, just 
from time to time. Is that right? 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: Understand, when they were separated, yes, I was 
talking to him because we were -- they were -- we were all trying 
to figure out what happened, you know, trying to  -- but I don't say 
"often" in a way every day, no. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Couple times a week?  
 
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't -- I don't recall. I mean. I don't remember. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Now, when -- would you tell him what Nicole's activities were, 
what men she was dating? 
 
A: No, I never said that to O.J.  
 
Q: Not at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You would lie to him? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And did Nicole know that O.J. was asking about her 
activities? 
 
A: No, I didn't tell -- I mean, I would just tell her that "O.J. called 
about you," and that was it, and we really didn't -- we don't talk 
much about it.  
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever see Mr. Simpson yell or scream at Nicole in 
your presence?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Did you ever see him strike her in your presence? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever see Mr. Simpson take drugs in your presence? 
 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You never saw Nicole take drugs either. Correct? 
 
A: My presence?  
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. KRAMER: I think we may have a double negative there. Did 
you mean to say correct, you never saw her take drugs? 
 
THE WITNESS: I never saw her take drugs. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Okay. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Now, in May of 1994 did you ever get introduced to Ron 
Goldman? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And how many times did you meet Mr. Goldman? 
 
A: I actually just met him once. That was the day when we were at 
Starbucks, and [Name Deleted] said hello to us, and he came and 
said, "This is our friend Ron," and that's where we met him. 
 
Q: [Name Deleted] said -- [Name Deleted] introduced you to Ron 
Goldman? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And who else was there?  
 
A: Just Nicole and I. 
 
Q: Now, did you know of any relationship between Nicole and 
Ron Goldman? 
 
MR. KRAMER: At that time? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.  
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
 
Q: And did you know who this Ron Goldman was? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Just a friend of [Name Deleted]'s. Right?  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And is that the only time you ever saw him? 
 
A: That's the first -- yeah.  
 
Q: The first and only time.  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And had you ever heard his name mentioned again --  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  -- before Nicole's death? Before Nicole's death? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When? 
 
A: When? Nicole -- actually, that evening Nicole, Faye and Ron 
and [Name Deleted] went out. They went to Roxbury, and so that's 
why. 
 
Q: How did you find out about that?  
 
A: Because that evening Ron had those things for the club, free 
entrance, and invited Nicole to go to that, to Roxbury. And so she 
invited me to go. I said, "No, I don't want to go." 
 
She said, "Oh, that's okay. I'll take Faye with me." 
 
So they went. So Nicole just told me, yeah, they did go, and they 
were very drunk and that Ron was the one who drove them home. 
 
Q: She told you that the next day? 
 
A: Yes. She said she couldn't drive, that Ron had to drive the 
Ferrari home. 
 
Q: Okay. And is that the last time you heard Ron Goldman's name? 
 
A: And she also mentioned about Ron calling -- calling -- calling 
her up and Nicole -- basically trying, you know, to court Nicole, 
because she -- he was attracted to Nicole. 
 
Q: Is that what Nicole said?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And she told that you Ron was interested in her? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did she tell you that they had gone out other than on this 
one occasion? 
 
A: I know they went out to dinner. They went to Locanda Veneta. 
 
Q: How do you know that? 
 
A: Because she told me. Because she told me that she paid for that 
dinner.  
 
Q: Why did she pay for it? Did she tell you? 
 
A: Because she felt bad. She said, you know, "This guy don't have 
any money, and I felt bad." 
 
Q: Now, when did she go out with Ron Goldman on that dinner? 
 
A: When? It's got to be any time after that. 
 
Q: Was it before or after her illness in May? 
 
A: It's got to be after her illness.  
 
Q: After? 
 
A: Yeah.  
 
Q: And was it just the two of them that went out to dinner? 
 
A: No. With [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: [Name Deleted], Ron Goldman and Nicole? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And was that the only other time she told you she went out with 
Mr. Goldman?  
 
A: Yes.  
 
 
Q: And do you know whether they had a sexual relationship? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Nicole tell you --  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -- that she had or had not? 
 
A: Well, she told me that she was not really interested with Ron. 
She says, "I'm not attracted to Ron." 
 
Q: That's what she told you?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Had she told Ron that she was not attracted to him? 
 
A: That I don't know. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know whether Ron drove her car other than on 
that one occasion that she told you about? 
 
A: If I know? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: No, I don't know. 
 
Q: Do you have any information as to why Ron Goldman was at 
her condominium that evening on June 12 when he was killed? 
 
A: Do I know?  
 
Q: (Nods head.) 
 
A: No, I didn't know that he was there. 
 
Q: You had no information about him being there except what you 
heard in the media afterwards. Right? 
 
A: Right. And also what Faye told me. 
 
Q: What did Faye tell you? 
 
 
A: Faye told me that --  
 
Q: Can you speak up, please? 
 
A: Faye told me that Ron was going to be there that evening, and 
that -- that was it. 
 
Q: When did Faye tell you this? 
 
A: That day that Faye and I had coffee in Starbucks. 
 
Q: After Nicole's death? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How long afterwards? 
 
A: I don't know. Week, two weeks after. Oh, no. She told me at the 
funeral, when we were in the car. 
 
Q: And she said to you that Ron Goldman was what? 
 
A: Ron Goldman. Because she spoke -- Faye spoke to Nicole, she 
said, around 9:30, and that Faye had told -- I mean Nicole had told 
Faye that Ron Goldman was coming. 
 
Q: At 9:30. 
 
A: Yeah. No, that's what Faye told me. They spoke around 9:30. 
 
Q: And in that conversation Nicole told Faye that Ron Goldman 
was coming over.  
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did she say -- did Faye tell you why Ron Goldman was coming 
over? 
 
A: Well, Faye told me that he was going -- she was going to see if 
he's good, and then if he's good, that they were going to do the 
three thing, the threesome thing. 
 
Q: Faye told you that if who's good? I'm confused. Could you 
relate that conversation to me again? 
 
A: They were trying to -- Faye told me that Nicole was going to try 
Ron Goldman and... 
 
MR. KRAMER: Let's take a moment. Okay? You'll have your 
answer. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the

(Recess.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 4:40. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Before the break you were telling us about a conversation you 
had with Faye Resnick concerning Ron Goldman. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: First of all, that conversation took place where? 
 
A: She mentioned to me about that at the funeral, in the car. 
 
Q: In the car? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was anyone else in the car with you and Faye? 
 
A: Yeah.  
 
Q: Who? 
 
A: The Jenners, the -- Cici and Christian, you know, the whole --  
 
Q: And was Ron Fischman there? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: So this conversation occurred in the presence of all those 
people. Right? 
 
A: Well, you know, she was kinda like whispering, and then when 
we went out and had coffee again she mentioned it to me again, 
that they were giggling and said that "Ron Goldman's gonna come 
tonight" -- 
 
Q: Who was giggling? 
 
A: Nicole and Faye over the phone were -- you know, she said that 
they were giggling and they say that they were -- that Ron 
Goldman was gonna come that evening. 
 
Q: Okay. Faye -- first of all, back to the car. Is it your testimony 
that no one else overheard to your knowledge the comments that --  
 
A: Well, see, she just said to me --  
 
Q: Faye said to you? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Listen to the question. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You are saying she whispered it in your ear in a limousine in 
which all those other persons were present. Is that what you're 
saying? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And she then later told you this in a coffee shop just 
when the two of you were alone. Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And what she told you is around 9:30 p.m. that she, Faye 
Resnick, had a telephone call with Nicole on the evening of June 
12th. Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And that the two of them, Nicole and Faye, were giggling in 
this telephone conversation --  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- right? And Nicole at the time was in Bundy and Faye was at 
the treatment center. Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And then she told you that Nicole said Ron Goldman was 
coming over to her place? 
 
A: Faye told me.  
 
Q: Right. That -- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -- Nicole told her that Ron Goldman was on his way over to see 
her, Nicole? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: For what purpose? 
 
 
A: They were giggling that they were gonna do it. 
 
Q: That Nicole and Ron Goldman were going to have sex that 
evening?  
 
A: I don't know if it was sex, but they said they were going to do it. 
 
Q: What does "do it" mean? What is the "it"? 
 
A: Well, if you think sex -- I don't know. I wasn't there. 
 
Q: It's not what I think. What did you understand her to mean when 
she said that to you? 
 
A: Well, what Faye told me was exactly what I told you, that they 
were going to do it that evening. 
 
Q: What did you understand that to mean? 
 
A: Probably they were going to have a -- they were going to have 
sex. 
 
Q: Okay. And is that all that Faye told you? 
 
A: She told me that Nicole was going to see if he's good --  
 
Q: Good at sex? 
 
A: Right, if he's good in bed. Then when she comes out of the 
rehab, that they were gonna do it.  
 
Q: Who was going to do it?  
 
A: The three of them. 
 
Q: And when Faye told you that, did she indicate whether Nicole 
and she were joking about this or whether they were serious about 
this? 
 
A: At that time I thought they were serious because they already 
have done it before with another guy, so...  
 
Q: Now, you knew, of course, based on what Nicole herself had 
told you, that she had no sexual interest in Ron Goldman. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So I assume --  
 
A: No, she was not attracted to Ron Goldman. 
 
Q: So I assume you didn't believe this story that you were being 
told. 
 
A: She told me she was not attracted to Ron Goldman, but, you 
know --  
 
Q: But what? 
 
A: That "Ron keeps on verbally seducing me. I don't know what to 
do with him." 
 
Q: Nicole told you that Ron kept verbally seducing her? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: When did Nicole tell you that? 
 
A: Those weeks that Ron was calling him -- calling her. I'm sorry. 
 
Q: What did Nicole tell you that Ron was saying to her? 
 
A: I don't remember. I mean verbally seducing, you know, like she 
said, "I can't wait to be with you, both naked," and this and that, 
and Nicole was getting tickled by what Ron was telling her. 
 
Q: Did Nicole tell you that she was changing her attitude towards 
Ron and that she was considering having a relationship with him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. So the last you knew is that she had no interest -- she was 
not attracted to him, as 
you put it. Right? 
 
A: She was not attracted to Nicole -- to Ron, yes. 
 
Q: Did Faye tell you anything else about this conversation? 
 
A: Faye told me that -- that's pretty much what I told you, that 
Nicole just kept on wanting to do this, you know, this thing that 
they just did with Brett, and she wanted to try it out again, and they 
thought that Ron Goldman would be the next guy that they could 
try. 
 
Q: Faye -- Nicole never mentioned that to you, right, having a 
threesome with Ron Goldman? 
 
A: No, no, no. 
 
Q: That all comes from Faye Resnick? 
 
A: Faye told me, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever tell that to Mr. Simpson, what you just 
related to us about this conversation with Faye Resnick? 
 
A: I told him. 
 
Q: When did you tell him? 
 
A: After the verdict. You know, I was like trying to understand 
Nicole. 
 
Q: And what did Mr. Simpson say when you told him? 
 
A: He was shocked. He said, "That's not the Nicole I know. Nicole 
was a devoted" --  
 
Q: Mr. Simpson express his views about Faye Resnick to you? 
 
MR. BAKER: You cut her off. 
 
THE WITNESS: Well, he's also upset about the book. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: "Also " meaning you are also upset?  
 
A: I was upset about the book, yes. 
 
Q: You are also upset about what Faye wrote about you and your 
affair with Terrence. Right? 
 
A: That's minor, but the whole -- the general tone of the book was 
inappropriate. A friend wouldn't write a book like that. 
 
Q: So I take it you no longer regard Faye Resnick as a friend. 
Right? 
 
A: I never regarded her as a friend. 
 
Q: But you are particularly unhappy about the book that she wrote. 
Correct? 
 
A: I thought so, too, yeah. The book was very tasteless. 
 
Q: When was the last time you spoke to Faye Resnick? 
 
A: Last time? 
 
Q: (Nods head.) 
 
A: When she was driving her car, her Range Rover, she saw me. I 
was on Highwood in Brentwood, and I said hello, you know. I 
said, "What did you do?" That's all. 
 
And she said, you know, she said, "Nicole was my friend." 
 
I said, "Well, Nicole was my friend, too. Why did you have to do 
that?" 
 
And then she said, "Call me." So she gave her card to me. I never 
called her back. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you -- were you driving in a car with Kris Jenner 
during the week of June 13 when you ran into Mr. Simpson at all? 
 
A: Christian? 
 
Q: Kris Jenner --  
 
A: Kris Jenner. 
 
Q: -- and you driving in a car on June 13 or 14 when you ran into 
Mr. Simpson in a car with Mr. Kardashian. Do you recall that 
incident? 
 
A: That wasn't Kris. That was Cici. Cici Shahian. 
 
Q: You and Cici?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. You recall than incident?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Describe it to me. 
 
A: Well, Cici and I felt funny about it. It Goes, "Oh, my God, look, 
there's my cousin with O.J. and here you are with me," and that 
was it. We just felt funny. 
 
Q: And what day was this? 
 
A: What day was this?  
 
Q: (Nods head.) 
 
A: Wednesday? I don't know.  
 
Q: Tuesday or Wednesday? 
 
A: Yeah, somewhere around there.  
 
Q: Where were you? 
 
A: I was in the car with Cici. 
 
Q: And where were you driving?  
 
A: On San Vicente. 
 
Q: And were you stopped at a light?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And next to you was Mr. Kardashian and Mr. Simpson in Mr. 
Kardashian's Mercedes. Correct? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Okay. And did you get out of the car? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you roll down the window to talk to them?  
 
A: No.  
 
Q: Did they say anything to you?  
 
A: No. I don't think they saw us.  
 
Q: Did they say anything to you?  
 
A: No. 
 
Q: All right. You don't know one way or the other whether they 
saw you. Right? 
 
A: No, I don't know.  
 
Q: Correct?  
 
A: Correct.  
 
Q: And what did you say to Cici and what did she say to you about 
this? 
 
A: What did she say... We just both felt funny. That was it. 
 
 
Q: Now, you hadn't seen O.J. Simpson since you had learned of 
Nicole's murder up until this point in time. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Didn't you want to get out of the car and embrace him and 
grieve with him? Didn't you want to get his attention? 
 
A: We were in the car, so it was kinda hard to --  
 
Q: I understand. 
 
A: And they were talking, and Cici and I were like talking to --  
 
Q: How do you know they were talking? 
 
A: I mean, we saw their mouths opening (Indicating), you know, 
so... 
 
Q: So you made no attempt to talk to him. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. What time of day was this?  
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay. Afternoon? Morning? Evening? 
 
A: I just don't remember. I'm sorry. 
 
Q: Which direction was Mr.Simpson and Mr. Kardashian headed 
in their car? 
 
A: We were going west.  
 
Q: On? 
 
A: San Vicente. 
 
Q: San Vicente. Okay. And why were you driving with Cici on that 
occasion, the day after Nicole's murder?  
 
MR. KRAMER: I am not sure you've established the actual date, 
but we will --  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: June 13.  
 
THE WITNESS: Why?  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: I don't remember. I don't know --  she was seeing me every day, 
almost every day at the time. 
 
Q: You were not upset with her then. Right? 
 
A: I thought she was my friend. 
 
Q: Right. You had no reason to be upset with her at that time. 
Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay, we will stop here. 
 
THE WITNESS: Okay. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Resume tomorrow at 9:30.

 EXAMINATION  BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Morning, Miss 
Fischman. 
 
A: Good morning. 
 
Q: Have you done anything to prepare for today's session of the 
deposition? 
 
A: Not really. I just looked for the  photos. 
 
 MR. KELLY: Can you speak up a little,  Miss Fischman? I can't 
hear you. 
 
THE WITNESS: Have I done anything? 
 
 BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Yes. Have you read anything, have 
you  talked to anyone, have you done anything since you  left here 
yesterday-   
 
A: No. 
 
Q:-other than to give a press conference to say that you were not 
sleeping with OJ. Simpson? 
 
A: That's pretty much, yes, what I did. 
 
Q: Okay. You haven't read anything at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you talk to anybody other than Mr. Kramer? 
 
A: I spoke to him, yeah, this morning. 
 
Q: Is that the only person? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, before yesterday's deposition  session did you do anything 
at all to get ready for or prepare for the deposition? 
 
A: I spoke to Mr. Kramer. 
 
Q: Did you speak to anyone else? 
 
A: That's pretty much...That's pretty much who I spoke to. 
 
Q: "Pretty much"? What does that mean? 
 
A: Well, I spoke to my lawyer-not my  lawyer-Mr. Williams in-did 
I speak- 
 
Q: John Taylor Williams? 
 
A: Yes. Yes. Oh, no, I didn't speak to him  yesterday. 
 
Q: I don't mean conversations yesterday. I   
 
mean any conversation about the deposition, about getting ready 
for the deposition, to prepare for the deposition. 
 
A: No, I didn't speak. Only Mr. Kramer. 
 
Q: And did you review or read any materials- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  -for that purpose? No? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Now, yesterday you had said to us that  you paid no attention to 
the subpoena. Now, I asked  you to go back and review all of your 
files, records  and documents and anything else that you might 
have in  response to the subpoena. Have you done so? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  What did you search? 
 
A: I looked-I tried to look for the  Brooke Skulski book notes, and 
I couldn't find that,  so - and the picture that you told me, I 
couldn't-  you know, see, the picture that you told me about  OJ., I 
gave that to Shapiro and to Marcia Clark, so I  couldn't find it. 
 
Q:  Well, did you look through all of your   
 
possessions and belongings for anything relating to Simpson, Mr. 
Simpson. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  -or Nicole? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q:  You found nothing? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: No other photographs? 
 
A: No more. 
 
Q: You don't have a single other picture that you took in the many 
year of your relationship  with Nicole? 
 
A: You're talking about pictures of Nicole  and my kids? There are 
a lot of pictures of my kids  with Sydney and Justin. 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: But I don't have pictures, you know- Nicole and I, our picture 
together was just my  birthday party. I mean, we didn't take a lot of  
pictures of ourselves, so... 
 
Q: Do you have pictures of Nicole and you at  a birthday party? 
 
A: My birthday party, 1993. 
 
Q: 1993. 
 
A: Right.   
 
Q:  Do you have any pictures of Nicole other than that picture? 
 
A: No, that's it. 
 
Q:  Do you have any pictures of OJ. Simpson other than what you 
produced yesterday? 
 
A: That's pretty much it. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Well, she also testified that she had a picture that 
she gave to Mr. Shapiro- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
MR. KRAMER:-and Miss Clark. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q:  Other than the Shapiro picture and the one that you produced 
yesterday? 
 
A: That's pretty much the pictures that we  have. 
 
Q:  Do you have any videotapes? 
 
A: No, no video. 
 
Q:  Does Ron Fischman have any, to your  knowledge, 
photographs and/or videotapes of  OJ. Simpson? 
 
A:  We don't have video. We never took  videotapes. 
 
Q:  Does Mr. Simpson have photographs of- does Mr. Fischman 
have photographs of OJ. Simpson? 
 
A: I don't know.   
 
Q:  Okay. What is [Name Deleted]'s last name? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Hold it.  Wait a second.  Is there-I-let me first 
explore whether there is some other way to do this rather than 
having this put in the transcript. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, I intend to take [Name Deleted]'s 
deposition, and I need to know his name and I need to know where 
he lives so that I can subpoena him. 
 
MR. BAKER: Object to all this as irrelevant. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You can object, but, you know,  I am still 
entitled to the information. It's a discovery process, and he may 
have relevant information concerning these murders, and I intend 
to  ask him. 
 
MR. KRAMER: I understand your desire to know  and that this 
may be reasonably calculated to lead to  the discovery of 
admissible evidence. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah. 
 
MR. KRAMER: I've got to balance, and the court  may have to 
balance, certain privacy interests- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me [Name Deleted]'s last  name and 
address are not, you k now, highly sensitive information. He is an 
ordinary person, like the rest  of us, whose name and address may 
appear in hundreds   
 
of different materials and documents. I don't understand why this is 
so sensitive. 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, the sensitivity is the concern that this 
deposition will be disseminated again and the press is going to 
harass [Name Deleted]. When we took the deposition of Kim 
Goldman, you were sensitive about her friends, and we wrote down 
addresses and their names. I don't understand the difference. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I don't believe that this is  necessary at all.  
Will you let the witness answer the  question? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Before I decide whether or not to  instruct her one 
way or another, and I will make that  determination, I wanted to 
see whether there was a  different way to go about it that might 
accomplish-might satisfy my needs. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What do you have in mind, sir? 
 
 MR. KRAMER: If there is some way that she can  give you this 
information without it being part of the  transcript, and if that is-
and I'm not privy to  whatever accommodations or measures you've 
taken in the  past to ensure that security measure, that privacy  
measure, but I would like to see if we could explore  that.   
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Well, what we'll do, without waiving 
any right whatsoever known to mankind concerning this, is agree 
to let her write it on a piece of paper, name and address and 
telephone number. 
 
MR. KRAMER: All right.  To the best of her knowledge. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It will become an exhibit. It will be the next 
exhibit in order, but it will say omitted in the transcript, and I Will 
keep possession  of it. Okay? 
 
MR. KRAMER: That's acceptable.  Fine. Okay. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you. It's Exhibit 160. 
 
MR. KELLY: Dan, is this from the beginning of  time also? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Do you have a phone number, please? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Want to write down the phone  number? 
 
THE WITNESS: Okay. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Home and work. 
 
A: I don't know his work number at all. 
 
Q:  Okay.  MR. BREWER: Did you get the employer and 
employer's address also?   
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Yeah, why don't you write that down 
also, the employer's name and address and telephone number. 
 
A: The employer's? 
 
Q:  Yeah, [Name Deleted]'s employer. 
 
A: I don't know the employer, but he works for UCLA. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Okay. All right. That's fine. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  What department? Do you know? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  What is-We are on the record. What does [Name Deleted] do 
for a living? 
 
A: He's a technologist. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Reporter, you will put an  omitted from 
the transcript on No. 160. 
 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 160 was marked for identification by the 
reporter and was retained by Mr. Petrocelli.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Okay. When you were with-
withdrawn.  Are you still seeing [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: As a friend, yeah. 
 
Q:  When did your romantic relationship with  [Name Deleted] 
end?   
 
MR. BAKER: Irrelevant. 
 
THE WITNESS: Do I have to answer that? 
 
MR. KRAMER: (Nods head.) 
 
THE WITNESS: I would say last year. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  1995? 
 
A: '95 
 
Q:  Okay.  Now, when you were at the home of [Name Deleted] on 
the evening of June 11- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  - you indicated you spent the night  there. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Did [Name Deleted] receive a phone call  from Nicole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  You didn't mention that to us yesterday, did you? 
 
A: No.  You didn't ask me. 
 
Q:  Okay. Fair enough.  I did ask you if you heard from Nicole,  
and you said no, but [Name Deleted]- 
 
A: I didn't talk to Nicole. I thought you  meant yesterday if I talked 
to Nicole. 
 
Q: But [Name Deleted] talked to Nicole.  Right?   
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  And [Name Deleted] got a phone call from Nicole while you 
were laying in bed right next to him. Right? 
 
A: I was not in bed. I was in the living room. We were talking. 
 
Q:  And then while you were talking in the living room, the phone 
rings, it's 2:00 o'clock in the morning, and it's Nicole. Right? 
 
A: Yeah. He went to his room and he picked up the phone. 
 
Q:  And he was on the phone with Nicole for a  bit. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Andy on over heard him talking to Nicole.  Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q:  And then he got off the phone, and then  you and [Name 
Deleted] discussed Nicole's call. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  And tell us as best as you can recall  everything that [Name 
Deleted] told you about that phone call with Nicole on June 12, 
wee hours of the morning. 
 
A: She apparently wanted to know if I was  there, and I told [Name 
Deleted], "Tell her I'm not here,   
 
because I don't want to go home." 
 
And so Nicole apparently said, "Tell her to go home because her 
kids are looking for her and Ron is angry.  Ron's been calling." 
 
So that's pretty much the conversation. 
 
Q: And knowing that Nicole was looking for you and knowing that 
you had instructed [Name Deleted] to lie on your behalf to Nicole- 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  -did you not feel any need to talk to 
Nicole the next morning to explain your whereabouts  and to 
maybe quell any anxieties on her part as to where you were? 
 
A: You know what? We were so busy with the recital, I figured 
we'd talk when we go for our run that Monday, because usually 
Monday we do our run, and I figured that would be the best time 
for us to talk. 
 
Q:  So the answer is no - 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  -you didn't feel the need to say anything to her on Sunday- 
 
A: No, I thought- 
 
Q:-correct? 
 
A: Yes, correct.   
 
Q:  Thank you. 
 
MR. BAKER: You guys are talking on top of each other again. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Please try to answer the question. 
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q:  Thank you. 
 
MR. KRAMER: And wait till he finishes his question, and then 
think about your response and make  your response. 
 
THE WITNESS: Okay. 
 
MR. BAKER: And let her answer. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Is that the only time that [Name 
Deleted] to your knowledge ever spoke to Nicole? 
 
A: To my knowledge? 
 
Q:  (Nods head.) 
 
A: They spoke the following morning. 
 
Q:  They did. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  How do you know? 
 
A: Because [Name Deleted] told me that they spoke  for an hour, 
Nicole and-Nicole called [Name Deleted] the  following morning. 
 
Q: What time?   
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Were you there? A: No, I wasn't there. 
 
Q: And when did you find out about [Name Deleted]'s phone call 
with Nicole? 
 
A: I spoke to him that day. He called me. 
 
Q:  Before the recital? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Where were you when you spoke to [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: I don't know. Maybe at home on Rockingham.  I don't know. 
 
Q: You were at Rockingham.' 
 
A: Probably. 
 
Q: And how long was your phone call with [Name Deleted]? 
 
A:  I don't remember. 
 
Q:  And tell me what was said. 
 
A: What was said? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
A: Pretty much what they talked about the  night before: That-that 
I should-that [Name Deleted]  should leave me alone for a while, 
that Cora's  marriage-let Cora take care of what she has to take care 
of, and pretty much she asked questions on how   
 
often I go to his house, and mainly they talked about the kids, and 
that's it. 
 
Q:  Was the evening before or the wee hours of Sunday morning 
on June 12 the first time that [Name Deleted] and Nicole ever 
spoke? 
 
MR. BAKER:  Speculation. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  To your knowledge. 
 
A:  To my knowledge? 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Have they ever met before? 
 
A: Oh, they have met before, yes. 
 
Q:  They had met. 
 
A: Oh, you mean before-what do you mean,  "before"? I mean, 
they've known each other for years. 
 
Q:  Oh, [Name Deleted] and Nicole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  I see. Was [Name Deleted]'s conversation with Nicole on the 
afternoon of June-on the morning of  June 12 the last time they 
spoke? 
 
A: Yes. As far as I know. 
 
Q:  Okay. 
 
MR. KRAMER: You said, "As far as I know?" 
 
THE WITNESS: As far as I know.   
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Okay. Do you know whether [Name 
Deleted] has ever been interviewed by the police department? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: By the D A? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or by Mr. Simpson's lawyers- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  -in the criminal or civil case? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Do you if he has or hasn't, or do you not  know one way or the 
other? 
 
A: He hasn't been interviewed. 
 
Q:  Have you ever supplied his name to anyone  before? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So when you went to the recital, you knew  of [Name Deleted]'s 
one-hour phone call with Nicole and what  was discussed in that 
call. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And Nicole was making-was expressing  her views to [Name 
Deleted] that he should stop seeing you  for a while. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. Because Nicole felt guilty about- that's why she called 
[Name Deleted].   
 
Q:  Why did Nicole feel guilty? 
 
A: Because she felt guilty because she's the one who kinda 
instigated me being-having a relationship with [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: You mean Nicole felt it was her fault- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  -that you were abandoning your family and- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  -children and carrying on with [Name Deleted]? 
 
A:  No, that's not why.  She felt guilty,  because she said to [Name 
Deleted], "I feel guilty. I feel  I'm the one who pushed Cora into 
having a relationship  with you." 
 
Q:  Did Nicole ever express that view to you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Was that true? 
 
A:  In a way, yes. 
 
Q:  How did Nicole instigate you to have a  relationship with 
[Name Deleted]? 
 
A: This is very-this has nothing to do  with Mr. Simpson's- 
 
Q:  In my view it's highly relevant, and I would ask that you 
answer the questions.   
 
MR. BAKER: It's totally irrelevant. BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: I 
know Mr. Simpson and his lawyers would like you to withhold 
from us this information- 
 
A: I- 
 
MR. BAKER: Let me just put my objection on the record. BY MR. 
PETROCELLI: Q:  -but I am going to press you to answer the 
question- 
 
MR. BAKER: That is- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:-and if you decline to answer the 
question, I will go to the judge. 
 
MR. BAKER: That is beautiful, but the point is  you are invading 
this woman's privacy rights in an  attempt to harass her. She has 
constitutional privacy rights which you are treading over in your 
diatribe to bring out as much rumor and gossip as you possibly  
can. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You are getting very good, Mr. Baker. 
 
 MR. BAKER: Thank you. 
 
 BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  You may answer the question.   
 
MR. KRAMER: Do you want to talk to me for a moment? 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
MR. KRAMER: We are going to want to take a break. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  I will be delving into this  area in detail. It 
directly involves Nicole, and it's highly relevant to understanding 
this witness' relationship with Nicole and her bias. Thank you. 
 
 THE WITNESS: Bias? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
 THEVIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record  now, and 
the time is approximately 10:09. 
 
 (Discussion held between the witness  and counsel outside the 
hearing of the reporter.) 
 
 THEVIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 10:14. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  The question I believe I asked before 
your break was: How did Nicole instigate you to have  a 
relationship with [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: She told me to loosen up.  She says, you  know, "Cora, you 
have such a bad marriage. Why don't you just relax, and probably 
this will help your   
 
marriage in the long run." 
 
Q:  What was the time frame? 
 
A: That was around February of '95 -no-94- 
 
Q:  '94? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you said that Nicole had known [Name Deleted] before 
you met [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: Well, in the neighborhood, because [Name Deleted] used to 
play basketball at the park, and they've seen-not-they don't know, 
but [Name Deleted]  knew her as being OJ.'s wife.  Not personally.  
They  didn't know each other personally. 
 
Q:  Did they ever go out together Nicole and [Name Deleted]? 
 
A:  Did they ever go out? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A:  The three-not together, no. 
 
Q: The two alone, to your knowledge? 
 
A: To my knowledge? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
A: They didn't go out.  They didn't go out. 
 
Q:  Are you unsure? You seem like you're  hesitating a bit.  A: 
Well, I don't know. I can say I don't 
 
know. But as far as I know, they never went out, the two of them. 
 
Q: Did they have any relationship between them before you met 
and started to go OUt with [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: No, they didn't have a relationship. 
 
Q: How old is [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: He's 32 years old. 
 
Q:  Okay. What is your age? 
 
A: I'm 41. 
 
Q:  The-when did you start to go out with  [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: When did I start? 
 
Q:  (Nods head.) 
 
A:  In February of '94. 
 
Q:  And when did to your knowledge your  husband find out about 
your affair with [Name Deleted]? 
 
MR. BAKER: Irrelevant. 
 
THE WITNESS: When? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Yes. 
 
A:  Around that time, in June. 
 
Q:  Before the recital. Correct? 
 
A:  Before the recital? Yes, yes, before the recital. 
 
Q:  And do you know how your husband found out? 
 
A:  The two of them talked to each other.  [Name Deleted] and Ron 
talked to each other. 
 
Q:  Do you know how that conversation came about? 
 
A:  Do I know? 
 
Q:  (Nods head.) 
 
A: Ron found out where [Name Deleted] was working,  and that's 
pretty much how they did. 
 
Q:  Where was [Name Deleted] working? 
 
A:  He used to work at the store. 
 
Q:  What store? 
 
A:  Vicente Foods. 
 
Q:  San Vicente Foods? 
 
A:  Uh-huh. 
 
Q:  And what did he do there? 
 
A: He's a-he works at the store.  I don't  know.  I guess Faye said 
grocery clerk. 
 
Q:  Grocery clerk.  Do you know whether OJ. Simpson told Ron  
about your affair with [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: If OJ. Simpson? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
A:  I don't know. 
 
Q:  Do you know whether Ron and Mr. Simpson ever talked about 
the affair that you were having and Ron's problems? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q:  You have no- 
 
A:  I don't know. 
 
Q:  -knowledge about that? 
 
A: Yeah, I don't know. 
 
Q:  Have you and Mr. Simpson ever talked  about his 
conversations with Ron concerning your marriage? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Never? 
 
A: We talked about why our marriage was  falling apart, but that's- 
 
Q:  You and Mr. Simpson did? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: When did you talk about that? 
 
A: When he was in jail. He said, you know,  "I wish you two could 
work your problems out." 
 
Q:  Before June 12 did you ever talk with  Mr. Simpson about your 
marital problems? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Or your affair with [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Okay. And you don't know whether Ron did? 
 
A:  I don't know. 
 
Q:  Okay. Do you know whether Ron was at Mr. Simpson's home 
on June 12 on June 11? 
 
A:  I know? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
A:  I don't know. 
 
Q:  Did you ever discuss that with Ron? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Okay. Now, did you and [Name Deleted] and  Nicole ever go 
out together? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  On how many occasions? 
 
A: Must be like two or three occasion. 
 
Q: Was there anyone else in the group besides the three of you on 
those occasions? 
 
A: No. It was just the three of us. 
 
Q:  And have you ever been out with Nicole,  [Name Deleted], you 
and someone else? 
 
A: There was one time when the- Nicole,  [Name Deleted] and I 
went out, and then [Name Deleted] was at the  place, too, and so 
the four of us, yeah. 
 
Q:  Okay. Where was that? 
 
A: Renaissance. 
 
Q:  Is that a nightclub? 
 
A: That's a club, yes. 
 
Q:  And when was that? 
 
A: When? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
A: It's got to be around February of '94. 
 
Q: Do you know whether OJ. Simpson at this time knew about 
your affair with [Name Deleted]? 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: In February? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Yes. 
 
A:  I didn't have- 
 
Q: Well, whenever it began, do you know  whether Mr. Simpson 
knew about it? 
 
A: No, I don't think he - 
 
Q: Did you tell Nicole not to tell him, 
 
A:  We didn't talk about it. I mean, it was like-we didn't talk about 
it. 
 
Q:  Okay. Did you understand that Nicole  would not tell him 
about the affair? 
 
A: Did I understand? 
 
Q: (Nods head.) 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Where else did you and [Name Deleted] 
 
and Nicole go out together besides the Renaissance? 
 
A: I think that's pretty much it. 
 
Q: Prior to Nicole's going to Cabo, she had expressed to you 
doubts about whether her relationship with OJ. Simpson was going 
to work out. Correct? 
 
A: Before Cabo? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
A:  She always had doubts about her relationship with OJ. 
 
Q:  Well, there was a time the prior year, in April of 1993, when 
she was very confident and optimistic that things would work out 
again and that  she- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  -went back with Mr. Simpson. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  And you encouraged her to do that. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: For the sake of putting her family back  together. Right? 
 
A: Yes, because that's what she wanted. 
 
Q: And Nicole had been going to some therapy  sessions and had 
experienced some self-growth and felt  that there was a better 
chance of her relationship  working. True?   
 
A: True. 
 
Q: By the way, do you know who the therapist was? 
 
A: No. You know what? It was-it was a group therapy thing. 
 
Q: Did you participate at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: A guy named [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: [Name Deleted] also attended? 
 
A: [Name Deleted] actually was the one who  recommended this 
one. 
 
Q: Faye Resnick also attended some sessions? 
 
A:  Well, she asked me to go, but there was  no way I could do it, 
and so she asked Faye, and so  they went a couple times to this 
session group. 
 
Q: Well, let's focus a little bit then on that time frame. You had 
many discussions with Nicole  about her decision to go back to Mr. 
Simpson in April  '93 and before. Correct? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q:  And what did she say to you in the final  analysis as to why she 
was going to go back with him? 
 
A:  Because she still loved OJ. At the time  she was afraid that OJ. 
will be completely out of her   
 
life.  She-and I told her, I said, "You make sure that if this is what 
you want this is what you want,"  because at the time OJ. was 
going out with Paula already, and she wanted her family back. 
 
Q: Did she tell you- 
 
A: She didn't think all these guys were-matched up with OJ. 
 
Q: In other words, she had had an  opportunity to date other men- 
 
A: Yes.  Yes. 
 
Q:  -for the first time in her adult life? 
 
A:  I would say yes, yeah. 
 
Q:  She had become involved with Mr. Simpson  at a very young 
age. Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And after a year or so of dating other  men, she decided that 
OJ. was the best person for her? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  And she told you all these things and you talked about them? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Did you and she discuss the problems that they had in 
the marriage and whether they would resurface if she got back 
together with   
 
OJ. Simpson? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  And relate to me what Nicole said to you about that. 
 
A: The problem? 
 
Q:  (Nods head.) 
 
A: One was if only OJ. could be around the kids. He travels too 
much. He-he traveled, he works too much. If only they could have 
a simple life  as opposed to all this, you know- 
 
Q:  Hollywood lifestyle? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Nicole didn't like that? 
 
A: She was not into that. She wanted -she  just wanted to raise her 
kids. 
 
Q: What about the womanizing issue, did she  discuss that with 
you? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Well, when they went back-when  they got back 
together, they both kinda talked to each other, saying that that will 
be over. Whatever  happened the last seven years of their marriage,  
they're gonna work on that.  That's why she was gonna clean up her 
act, and OJ., whatever he was doing, it was just going to be the two 
of them. They were going to make a commitment and it's just  
going to be the two of them.  No more of these other men or other 
women. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: So Nicole told you that she had reason 
to believe that OJ.'s womanizing would not be a problem anymore? 
 
A:  That's pretty much what-yeah. 
 
Q: What about OJ.'s violent temper? Did Nicole discuss with you 
whether that would be a problem - 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  -if she got back together? 
 
A: Well, you know what? We didn't talk  about that.  We talked 
about how husbands get angry,  you know, and we talked about 
how we said sometimes  we'd push each other's button, because 
knowing-you know, that's pretty much our conversation. 
 
Q: But did Nicole discuss with you her concerns about whether she 
would run into problems with physical abuse or violence if she got 
back with  OJ. Simpson? 
 
A: She never-she never talked to me about  that. 
 
Q: Not once?   
 
A: Not once. 
 
Q: But you knew her way as far back as May of 1989, correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:-Nicole? And you knew that she was unhappy in her marriage- 
 
A: Not '89. I knew her then, yeah, but the time that I really knew 
her was when she got separated from OJ.  So it was in the later part 
of '91. 
 
Q: And Nicole told you that one of the  things that caused her to 
end her relationship or her marriage with OJ. Simpson was the 
beating she  received in 1989. Correct? 
 
A: No, she didn't tell me that. 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: She told you that from that point on, 
she  wanted out of the relationship. Correct? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. She was just tired of  everything already, the 
womanizing, the-pretty much  everything. That's what she said.  
And also she  already was having an affair with [Name Deleted]. 
She   
 
found this guy, and they had been going out. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  She was having that affair while she 
was still married and living at Rockingham. Correct? 
 
A: Yes, Yes. 
 
Q:  Before she moved out of Rockingham, had Nicole told you 
about the New Year's Eve beating in 1989? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You only learned about it after she moved out? 
 
A: Yes. Yes, she told me. 
 
Q: After she moved out? 
 
A: After she moved out, yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. So when she decided to end her  marriage and move out, 
she discussed that with you.  Right? 
 
A: When she-yes. 
 
Q: And she discussed the fact that she was  having an affair with 
Alessandro, with you. Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  When did that affair begin to your knowledge? 
 
A:  To my knowledge?  I don't know. When  I-when we got really 
close, she already said it's been going on and she's thinking of 
moving in with this guy, so I'm not sure as to the time frame. It 
could be six months. 
 
Q: Six months before she actually moved out? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. And during that six-month period you and she would 
have- started to have many conversations together. Right? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: And that's when you started to develop a close bond with her.  
Right? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: You have to answer audibly. 
 
A:  Yes, yes. 
 
Q:  In those conversations did she tell you  about the physical 
abuse in her marriage? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: But she told you about womanizing, right,  by OJ. Simpson? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: And his not being around home and 
around  the kids, issues like that. Correct? 
 
A: Right, because of his traveling. And she   
 
always wished that his work could be here in California so they 
could be together. That's the intention. 
 
Q:  Now, did she tell you that she was afraid of talking to OJ. 
Simpson and telling him about her decision to leave the marriage? 
 
MR. KRAMER: At what time? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Before she made the decision-before she told 
him. 
 
Q: Did she discuss with you the anticipation of telling Mr. 
Simpson and what that was going to be  like? 
 
A:  The anticipation? You know, I don't  remember, because all I 
know is I told her, you know,  "You can't go on with your affair if 
you're gonna live  there. You have to move out and try to"-that's  
pretty much-I don't know the-I mean, because  when we started 
talking, she already-when OJ. got back from New York, she spoke 
to OJ., and they-you  know, she said, "I wanted out." 
 
Q:  Did she relate to you what OJ.'s  reaction was? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you understand that OJ. was  opposed to the 
marriage ending?   
 
A: Of course, yeah. 
 
Q:  And Nicole told you that? 
 
A: Uh-huh.  Yes. 
 
Q: And OJ. told you that also? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you discuss Nicole's affair with OJ. before Nicole left the 
house? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And what about afterwards? 
 
A: Afterwards? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Didn't OJ. ask you about the affair? 
 
A: Yes, but I denied it. 
 
Q:  When did he ask you? 
 
A:  Even during the time - the whole time  that they were trying to 
reconcile-I mean, they  tried to reconcile, and even the time when 
he was  trying to understand why she wanted to get out of the  
marriage. 
 
Q: Throughout that time period he would ask  you- 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q:  -whether Nicole had an affair? 
 
A:  Why did she want to move out, what was   
 
the reason, and, you know, he said, "Is she having an affair?" I said 
no. 
 
Q: Didn't he make some comment to you about Alessandro to the 
effect that he's drinking his champagne and eating his caviar? 
 
A: Yes. See, he suspected that-he suspected that she was having an 
affair with [Name Deleted], and he asked me, he says, "Are they 
having an affair?" 
 
I said, "No. They're just friends."  And he says, "Well, someone's 
eating the  caviar and champagne every time I leave." 
 
 So he made that comment, yes. 
 
Q: I see.  But you didn't tell him about the  affair. 
 
A: I denied the affair. I said they were just friends. 
 
Q: Now, how often in the beginning 
 
A: Because Nicole made-because Nicole  told me, "Don't ever, 
whatever happens, don't ever  tell OJ. that I had an affair before I 
left Rockingham," and I-I made a promise to her. 
 
Q: After Nicole moved out of the house, she  continued to see 
Alessandro? 
 
A: I'm sorry.  What?   
 
Q: After Nicole moved out of Rockingham, did she continue to see 
Allessandro? A: Yes. 
 
Q: And how long did that relationship last? 
 
A: Oh, God. Well, it kinda fell apart  when-started to fell-fall apart 
when Nicole moved out of Rockingham pretty much. 
 
Q: And do you know the reason? 
 
A: Well, as Nicole said, "It kinda fade away," you know. 
 
Q: Did she tell you that Alessandro was  concerned about Mr. 
Simpson being jealous and  vindictive? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, and also Nicole kinda  wanted-yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Okay. Who was Nicole's next 
relationship after Alessandro? 
 
A: Relationship? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Are you talking about 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Men she dated. 
 
THE WITNESS: Men she dated? 
 
MR. KRAMER: A relationship in terms of substance or-I'm not 
sure   
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Man-woman relationship, dating, whatever-
however you want to characterize it. 
 
THE WITNESS: Okay. Well, in passing was Keith, because Keith 
moved in. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Keith moved in the Gretna Green? 
 
A:  Well, not moved in. As a guest, as a house guest, because at the 
time he was fix--he was  trying to open up Mezzaluna in 
Brentwood, and he  needed, you know, he needed a place and 
Nicole offered her guest house. 
 
Q:  And while-Nicole dated Keith for a  while. Right? 
 
A:  They didn't date, but Keith was very attracted to Nicole, and 
Nicole being lonely, they had  a-they had sex. 
 
Q:  More than once? 
 
A:  That I don't know, but I got mad at her about that. 
 
Q:  Why? 
 
A:  Because-because I told her that she was vulnerable and that she 
shouldn't do it just for  sex, you know, at that time. 
 
Q: Nicole told you, you told us yesterday,   
 
how OJ. confronted Keith and her the next day after he observed 
them having sex together. Do you recall that? 
 
A: If-yes.  Yes. 
 
Q: And did she tell you that Mr. Simpson was yelling and 
screaming when he confronted Nicole and OJ.-and Keith? 
 
A:  You know, because the following day when we went out for 
our run, Nicole said, "Oh, OJ. saw  us." 
 
I said, "What do you mean?"  She says, "OJ. saw us, and he heard  
everything." 
 
 I said, "Oh, really"  And that's pretty  much the conversation.  I 
said, "Was he mad?" I said. 
 
"Yeah."  And then so I said, "Was he mad"  And she said, "Yes." 
 
Q: So this was after OJ. had confronted  Keith and Nicole the 
following morning that you had  this conversation- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  -with Nicole? 
 
A: Yes, the following morning, that 
 
Q:  Now, you told Barbara Walters the following: "She," referring 
to Nicole, "told me the following day that OJ." -Withdrawn. 
 
Q:  Did Nicole tell you that OJ. screamed and yelled when he 
confronted Keith and Nicole the next day? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Screamed and yelled? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Yeah, at them for what they were 
doing. 
 
A: Nicole said to me, "OJ. was mad. " 
 
Q:  Did she tell you why OJ. was mad? 
 
A: Because OJ. saw them doing the act. 
 
Q: Did she tell you why OJ. was there  watching the two of them 
do the act? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you ask OJ. why she-he was outside looking at them? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Have you ever asked OJ. Simpson about  this? 
 
A:  I don't think so. 
 
Q: Okay.  After Keith, who did Nicole date? 
 
A:  Refresh my memory, yeah. Okay. After Keith was [Name 
Deleted]. She was attracted to this  guy, and so she asked Kris 
Jenner, she says, "I want   to meet this guy," so that's how this 
whole thing was set up. 
 
While Keith was still a house guest at Gretna Green, Nicole went 
to Cabo with Kris and [Name Deleted] and Faye, and Kris invited 
Nicole.  She said, "[Name Deleted]'s gonna be there," and that's 
where they all went. 
 
Q: What was [Name Deleted]'s occupation? 
 
A: He was a shoe salesman for Neiman-Marcus  at the time. 
 
Q: What was Alessandro's occupation, by the  way? 
 
A: He used to be the maitre d' of Toscana,  and then he-at the same, 
a hairdresser. 
 
Q: Okay. How long did Nicole date Keith- 
 
A: Keith? 
 
 MR. BAKER: [Name Deleted]. 
 
 BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:-[Name Deleted]? 
 
A: I would say not that long, because [Name Deleted]- 
 
MR. KRAMER: You've answered the question. If  he wants to 
know why, then that's fine. 
 
THE WITNESS: Oh, okay. 
 
MR. KRAMER: But just answer the question. It will speed things 
up. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  And what was the reason? 
 
A: What? 
 
Q: You were just about to explain why. 
 
A: It just didn't work out. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know whether Mr. Simpson ever confronted 
[Name Deleted] during that relationship? 
 
A: Confronted? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: If I know, no. 
 
Q: And did Nicole ever tell you such a  thing? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Okay. This is all in the year 1992.  Correct? 
 
A: Yes.  
 
Q: Now, what was Nicole's next relationship after [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: [Name Deleted]? Well, she was getting a  divorce, so she met 
[Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: Okay. And how long did that relationship  last? 
 
A: About four months. Yeah, four to six months, something like 
that. 
 
Q: And do you know whether Mr. Simpson ever confronted [Name 
Deleted]? 
 
A: If Mr. Simpson confronted? 
 
Q:  (Nods head.) 
 
A: I don't think he confronted [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: Okay. Did Mr. Simpson know that Nicole was dating [Name 
Deleted] when she was dating him? 
 
A: If I knew- 
 
Q: Whether he was aware of that relationship when it was going 
on. 
 
A: Of [Name Deleted]? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And how do you know that? 
 
A: If Mr. Simpson knew about- 
 
Q: (Nods head.) 
 
A: Because Nicole told OJ. on Mother's  Day-I remember that 
Mother's Day, and she actually  told OJ., "I'm in love, and I want to 
be with this  person"- 
 
Q: And- 
 
A:-"So don't mess it up, " or something like that. She says, "Don't 
mess it up.  I love this man." 
 
Q: This is May of 1992? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  And as of this point in time OJ. Simpson had not yet to your 
knowledge had a relationship with Paula Barbieri. Correct? 
 
A: At that time they were going out. I knew that they were going-
that OJ. was going out with Paula.  They were dating. 
 
Q: And to your knowledge OJ. Simpson at this point in time was 
still interested in getting Nicole back, as of the time Nicole sat 
down with him  on Mother's Day? 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: At that time? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: (Nods head.) 
 
A: See, at the time they were working on their divorce already, you 
know, and so that's pretty  much what their conversations- 
 
Q: But you understood form your  conversations with Nicole that 
Mr. Simpson was still  interested in putting the marriage back 
together for a  period of time. Correct? 
 
A: Yes.  Yes.   
 
Q:  And that period of time to your knowledge lasted the spring of 
1992. Correct? 
 
A: Spring of 1992, which is March April? Yes. 
 
Q:  And Mr. Simpson called you and would talk to you from time 
to time about Nicole. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  And asked what she's up to? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q:  Correct? 
 
A:  Yes, correct. 
 
Q:  And he would express to you his desire to want to work things 
out with Nicole. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q:  Even though they were in the middle of  divorce proceedings. 
Correct? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And what would you say to him and what would he say to you 
in these conversations? 
 
A:  Well, he's trying to understand Nicole. He was trying to 
understand Nicole and what was- what does she really want, and I 
told-you know, I  told him, "Just leave her alone.  She needs some 
time to be alone. She needs to reassess her life," and  pretty much, 
you know, said that, "She loves you. She   
 
loves you.  She still wants the kids," words like that. 
 
Q:  And what would he say to you? 
 
A: Well, he says you know "I love that woman." You know, "We 
had such a great marriage. What happened?" 
 
Q: Did you ask him about the incident when he beat her, in these 
conversations? 
 
A: Did I ask who? 
 
Q:  Mr. Simpson. 
 
A: No, I never asked Mr. Simpson. 
 
Q:  Did you mention to him the incident involving Keith 
Zlomsowitzh after it occurred and after Nicole told you about it? 
 
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: Keith? Yeah, I asked. I asked  him about that, and 
he said he saw them, and he said that-he says, you know, "I don't 
like what Nicole  does because the kids are there." He says, "If she 
wants to do something like that, she should do it someplace, but 
not with the kids around." 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Did you question Mr. Simpson as to 
why he  was looking in the window? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You didn't? 
 
A: Well, he just told me, but that's about-I didn't even know he was 
at the window. He told me that he saw, so I don't know-you know, 
to me probably you're right. 
 
Q:  Did he describe what he saw? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Okay.  You had already heard about this from Nicole. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. Did there come a time in 1992 when  to your knowledge 
Mr. Simpson stopped pursuing Nicole in trying to get the marriage 
back together? 
 
A: You know, after when they got divorced,  
 
Q:  That was October of '92. A: Yes. 
 
Q: So all the way through October of '92, your understanding was 
that Mr. Simpson was still interested in putting things back 
together with  Nicole? 
 
A: I mean, they were still talking, yes, about that, yes. 
 
Q:  And you know this based on your conversations with Mr. 
Simpson and Nicole?   
 
A:  About what? 
 
Q:  That he was skill interested in putting the relationship back 
together. 
 
A: Yes, they were both interested in trying to work things out. See, 
Nicole didn't want a divorce. She just wanted a separation. OJ. 
wanted a divorce, and so- 
 
Q: Why did OJ. want a divorce on the one hand and on the other 
hand put his marriage back  together? 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Well, because, see, to him, if she wants to 
continue having men in her life, OJ.  said, "Well, if that's what she 
wants, that's what she  wants, and we get divorced." But, see, 
Nicole just  wanted a separation because she just wanted to know  
what was going on in her life. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  So OJ. told you that if Nicole wanted 
to date men, then he wanted a divorce? 
 
A: Oh, no, no, no, no. He says, you know,  - "you want a 
separation, then we get divorced. That's it. It's over." 
 
Q:  So OJ. told you that if Nicole wanted a  separation, then he 
wanted a divorce, but he did not want to have a separation. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Is that what you're saying? 
 
A:  Yes.  Yes. 
 
Q:  But he told you that he was prepared to go back in the 
marriage, but no legal separation, get back together 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  -live in the same house. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q:  And Nicole told you that that was not  acceptable to her. 
Correct?  She wanted a separation. 
 
A:  She wanted a separation, yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. And after [Name Deleted], who did  Nicole next have a 
relationship with? 
 
A: [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q:  And after [Name Deleted]?  
 
A: [Name Deleted]-I mean [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q:  And after [Name Deleted]? 
 
A:  [Name Deleted]? [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q:  [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: [Name Deleted], you know, the guy, the Cabo. 
 
Q:  That's the next year, though. Right? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Correct?   
 
She had a relationship with [Name Deleted] in 1992- 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q:-and into 1993. Right? A: Uh-huh. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Is that a yes? 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. Wait. Could you repeat the question? I want 
to make sure- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  I think you jumped a year on me. 
 
A: Yeah, I'm getting confused now. 
 
Q:  Okay.  After [Name Deleted] she then dated  [Name Deleted], 
and that was the Christmas of '92 into January of '93. Correct? 
 
A: '93, correct, yes. 
 
Q:  And after [Name Deleted] she went back with Mr. Simpson.  
Correct? 
 
A:  Yes, around March, yes. 
 
Q:  Around March. And in between there,  there's Marcus Allen 
somewhere. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: The first time. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q:  And when was-   
 
A: In between also, when she left- when she went to move to 
Gretna Green, that's when the relationship with Marcus Allen 
started. You know, whenever Marcus Allen was in town, she saw 
Marcus. 
 
Q:  She saw Marcus Allen almost immediately when she moved 
into the Gretna Green- 
 
A: Not right away, no. 
 
Q:  She moved in January of '93 or- excuse me-January of 1992 or 
thereabouts. 
 
A:  Uh-huh.  Yes. 
 
Q:  That was the first place she moved into  out of Rockingham. 
Correct? 
 
A:  Right, Uh-huh. 
 
Q:  And you are saying not too long thereafter she began to see 
Marcus Allen? 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Did she see him continuously through the year of 1992? 
 
A: Not continuously. Whenever he was  around, whenever he was 
in town. 
 
Q: And did there come a time when she  stopped seeing Marcus 
Allen? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  And when was that? 
 
A: When she went back to OJ.   
 
In around March or April of 1993. 
 
Correct? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Okay. Do you know whether Mr. Simpson ever confronted 
[Name Deleted] or [Name Deleted] while Nicole was dating them? 
 
A: No, OJ. didn't confront them. 
 
Q: And do you know whether he ever confronted Marcus Allen 
about Nicole's dating him.' 
 
A: I-yes, I think the two of them talked. 
 
Q:  And how do you know that? 
 
A: Because Nicole told me and OJ. told me. 
 
Q:  Tell me what OJ. told you about that talk. 
 
A: That they talked and that Marcus Allen  apologized. That's 
pretty much, you know- 
 
Q:  When did OJ. tell you that? 
 
A: Around-it was around that tune when Nicole told-when Nicole 
told OJ. about the affair,  so say April, May, June, because they 
were already playing golf already, and then Marcus' wedding took  
place at Rockingham. 
 
Q:  Did OJ. tell you he was unhappy when he  learned about that 
affair? 
 
A: Of course, yeah. He was shocked, yeah.   
 
He was shocked? A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  Do you know what prompted Nicole to tell Mr. Simpson about 
her affair with Marcus Allen? 
 
A:  Because she felt that if they were gonna start a life together, 
that they were gonna come clean both ways. No more womanizing, 
and she's not going to have any secrets or any men. If it's the two 
of them, it's just the two of them. 
 
Q:  And at that point she told Mr. Simpson the various men- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:-she had been dating? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q:  Including Marcus Allen? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, wasn't that Mr. Simpson's idea, that  she disclose to him 
all of her relationships? 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS:  It was not his idea. It was also Nicole's idea, 
because she felt like if they gonna  start something, they gonna 
start fresh with no  secrets. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Did she tell you, Nicole, that   
 
Mr. Simpson had asked her to disclose all those relationships? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Did she  tell you that? 
 
A: I think the two of them volunteered it, talked about their 
relationship. 
 
Q: How do you know they both volunteered? 
 
A: Because she told me. 
 
Q:  That's what she said? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Did you ever ask Mr. Simpson about that? 
 
A: Well, he told me- 
 
MR. KRAMER: Did you ask? 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  And what did he tell you? 
 
A: That Nicole told-see, but- 
 
Q:  What did he tell you? That's my  question. 
 
A: Oh, that Nicole told him everything. 
 
Q:  Did he tell you that he had asked Nicole  to tell him.' 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Okay. Did he tell Nicole everything?   
 
MR. BAKER:  Speculation. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Did he tell you that he then told Nicole 
everything? 
 
A: Yeah, I think so, yes. 
 
Q:  What did he tell you that he told Nicole? MR. BAKER: I think 
that's triple hearsay. 
 
THE WITNESS: What did- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  What did he tell you that he told 
Nicole? 
 
A:  Well, they talked about Paula. 
 
Q:  Anyone else? 
 
A: That was it. 
 
Q:  Okay. And this conversation occurred when they reconciled? 
 
A: They were trying-yes. 
 
Q:  And so when they reconciled, the understanding was neither 
would date anyone else. Right? 
 
A:  Excuse me? 
 
Q:  Neither would date anyone else. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q:  Now, did either Nicole or OJ. Simpson  tell you of any ground 
rules that they set for their  reconciliation period?   
 
A: Ground rules? 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
A: That they were to be committed to each other. 
 
Q:  And that Nicole would move in? 
 
A: Oh, no, they didn't talk about that right away, no. No. 
 
Q: Did OJ. Simpson ever talk to you during this year in which they 
were trying to reconcile about letting Nicole move back in? 
 
A: They weren't even thinking of that,  moving back in, no. 
 
Q:  How do you know that? 
 
A: Because Nicole at the time said they really have to work 
themselves first before the two of  them move back. 
 
Q:  Did Mr. Simpson say to you that he wanted Nicole to move 
back in at anytime since they began to reconcile? 
 
A:  If Mr. Simpson asked? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he ever have a conversation with you  when he said, "I want 
Nicole to move in now.  I think  it's time that she move in"?   
 
A: Well, if they move in, they said they have to be ready for each 
other. 
 
Q: What did OJ. Simpson say to you about that? That's what I'm 
trying to find out. 
 
A:  What did OJ. Simpson say? 
 
Q:  About Nicole moving in. Tell me what he said to you. 
 
A:  You know, the moving in, it's kinda -what they-the two of them 
talk about moving back together, and they say, "No.  We love each 
other, but we cannot live together. I think it's better to have each 
other place," you know. So I don't know what kind of answer you 
want me to- 
 
Q: I am just trying to get from you what  Mr. Simpson told you 
about the subject of Nicole  moving into his house, what he told 
you. 
 
A: I don't remember. They both wanted to be  together, but they 
could not find the time or-they seemed not ready to live in one 
house because they  said that they don't want any more fighting, 
you know,  because they said, you know, "You can't put the kids 
back and forth from one house and then separate." So  they were 
just more concerned about the kids.  Especially Nicole was 
concerned also about the kids, 
 
  
 
you know. 
 
Q: Did- 
 
A:  So I cannot answer.  It's hard for me to answer that question. 
 
Q:  Did OJ. Simpson tell you that he had given Nicole any rules or 
requirements or stipulations for this reconciliation? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Mr. Simpson told you that? 
 
A:  Well, yeah, he mentioned to me. 
 
Q:  What did he tell you? 
 
A: He said that, you know, "If we move back  together, I will not"-
"I will not allow this going  out with the girls and going out 
dancing." That was  one. And, you know, he says, "If we were 
committed to  each other, that's it; we're committed to each other,  
but I will not tolerate the going out and going out  with girls and 
coming back at 3:00, 4:00 o'clock in  the morning?" That's what he 
said. 
 
Q:  Did he tell you that there were any  friends of Nicole that he 
would not allow her to see? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Who? 
 
A:  Like [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q:  What did he say to you about [Name Deleted]   
 
and not wanting Nicole to see her? 
 
A:  Because [Name Deleted] is a cocaine addict. 
 
Q:  Is that what Mr. Simpson told you? A:  Well, Nicole told me 
that, too, that OJ. doesn't like [Name Deleted] because, you know, 
they're bad influence. 
 
Q:  And Mr. Simpson told you that also? 
 
A:  At some point, yeah, he mentioned to me. 
 
Q:  Any other friends that he said he didn't  want Nicole to see? 
 
A: That's pretty much who. 
 
Q:  Did he tell you that there was a period  of time, a deadline, for 
which he was going to  participate in this reconciliation process 
with  Nicole? 
 
A:  A deadline? 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
A:  There was never a deadline on this two,  anyway. 
 
Q:  He never told you of any such deadline.  Correct? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: He never said, "I'm only going to give it  one year and that's it." 
Correct? Correct? 
 
A:  I don't remember that. I don't want to   
 
say yes and then, you know-I don't remember that. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And Nicole never told you of a one-year deadline either. 
Correct? 
 
A: Correct, yeah. 
 
Q:  Do you know if they then began to see a therapist together at 
any time during this period? 
 
A: Yeah, they tried-they saw a therapist. 
 
Q:  And who was the therapist? 
 
A: [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you know how often they went together  to [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: I don't know. I don't remember. 
 
Q:  Did Nicole tell you about her visits with  Mr. Michaels from 
time to time? 
 
A: Yeah, she told me, yes. 
 
Q:  And did she tell you how OJ. was responding to going to see 
[Name Deleted]? 
 
A: Yeah, the two of them, yes. 
 
Q: And what did she tell you about that? 
 
A: She says that they're going to try to  make a commitment and 
that they're working on their  relationship and that they're gonna try 
and-that's pretty much that's what it is.  They're gonna try and   
 
work it out, see what happens. 
 
Q: And after the visits to [Name Deleted], would Nicole tell you 
how they went? 
 
A: How they went? 
 
Q: Yeah, how the visits went and how OJ. was responding to the 
visits. 
 
A: No, not really. 
 
Q: Did you ever talk to OJ. Simpson about his visits with [Name 
Deleted]? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  No. Okay.  Now, was there a period of time aftern they began 
to see one another in April of '93 that  things were going well, 
based on your observations? 
 
A: Right, yeah. 
 
Q:  And how long was that? 
 
A:  '93 was when they went to Cabo. They had  a great time in 
Cabo, so- and then when he left, it  started- Nicole started changing 
her mind, and she didn't want- 
 
Q:  When Mr. Simpson left to go to New York  for the football 
season.  Is that what you mean? 
 
A: Football season? 
 
Q:  You said "when he left." 
 
A: You're talking about April? You're  talking about April of '93? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
MR. KRAMER: I think you're talking about '94. 
 
THE WITNESS: Oh, '94. You talking about April of '94? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  No. I am talking about now the two 
of them are planning to get back together, and they start their 
reconciliation. 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  -April of '93- 
 
A:  I'm sorry. 
 
Q:  -and I asked you if there was period of  time during which 
things appeared to you to be going  well between them, and you 
said yes. 
 
A: Yes.  Yes.  Right. 
 
Q:  Okay. And I asked you how long a period  of time was that. 
 
A:  Pretty much that whole year, from April to the time that they 
went to Cabo. 
 
Q:  When did they go to Cabo? 
 
A:  In March, late March of '93-'94. 
 
Q:  So for that entire year, based on your  observations- 
 
A: Uh-huh.   
 
Q:-the relationship was progressing very well? 
 
A:  It was off and on yeah, because- 
 
Q:  "Off and on," I'm confused by that. What does "off and on" 
mean ? 
 
A: Well, they would plan on getting married the following year, 
and then they said no, they're really not ready to live together, but 
they could be  together but not living together, so that's what I  
mean by off and on?  But if they had a good  relationship, I would 
say yes, they did. 
 
Q:  During that year. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  There were no breaks in that relationship during that year? 
 
A: I don't think so, no. 
 
Q:  Did Nicole ever tell you during that year  that it was not going 
to work out and she was changing  her mind and . . .  
 
A:  April...You know what? She must have said it at one time, 
yeah. 
 
Q:  When did she say it? 
 
A: I don't remember. You know, it's  hard when you're running and 
you're just talking,  it's-I don't remember but, yeah, we talked about   
that. Like sometimes she feels like it was too early for her to go 
back to OJ., like she's not really ready. She felt like she just wanted 
like another year. She said, "I came back to OJ. too early," but she 
was willing to work it out, you know. 
 
Q:  Well, yeah.  What I am trying to find out is, you're talking 
about when they would get back together as a husband and wife 
and live in the same home again. Right? 
 
A:  Yeah, right. 
 
Q:  But during this period of time you  understood that what they 
were doing was not seeing other people, but just concentrating- 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  -on their relationship, right, to try  to make it work. Right? 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  But was there a time in that year when Nicole told you or OJ. 
Simpson told you that they don't want to try it make it work 
anymore, that they  want to stop it? 
 
A: Oh, no, no, they- 
 
Q: That never happened? 
 
A:  No, it didn't happen. 
 
Q:  And Nicole never said to you, 
 
"You know,   
 
I want to start seeing other men again," or, "I want to start dating 
again"? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  At no time? A: No. No time, no. 
 
Q:  Did you talk to Mr. Simpson from time to time during that year 
about this relationship and his feelings about it? 
 
A: Uh-huh, yes. 
 
Q:  And what did he tell you, as that year progressed, about the 
relationship? 
 
A:  Well, you know, they both were 
 
Q:  I am asking you what he did, not -what  he told you. 
 
A: Oh, what he told me?  He just wants to  make sure that what 
Nicole is doing is-whatever she  was doing is what she wants to do. 
That's pretty much  it. He says, "Do you think she really is serious  
about that?" 
 
I said, "Yeah," you know, "look what we're  doing," you know, 
"we even taking" _ "playing"-you know, she never liked to play 
golf.  We started taking  golf lessons. You know, we did a lot of 
things. And  at the time she was gonna move to wherever OJ. 
wanted  her to move.  That time they talked about Cabo San   
 
Lucas.  You know, they found a place. 
 
Q:  Tell me about that. They found a place in Cabo? 
 
A: Yes, they found-no. OJ. said they had a lot in Cabo and- 
 
Q: A lot? A: A- MR. BAKER: A space, lot. 
 
THE WITNESS: A lot. A lot. Space. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Right. They had- 
 
A: Property. 
 
Q:-purchased it? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  Who purchased it? 
 
A:  I don't know.  But-so Nicole was  excited about that because 
she said, "Oh, that's  great. I'll just be in Cabo and sunbathe the  
whole"-you know, and Nicole wanted to move to  wherever OJ. 
wanted to move, so... 
 
Q:  Did Nicole tell you that she would have  to sell her-or use her 
savings to help pay for that  place in Cabo, to build it out? 
 
A:  To use her savings? 
 
Q:  Yeah, to use the money she had gotten   
 
from her divorce settlement. 
 
A:  She never- 
 
Q:  Never discussed that with you? 
 
A:  No, she didn't talk to me.  We didn't even, you know, didn't talk 
about that. 
 
Q:  Did either person, Nicole or OJ. Simpson, ever tell you of any 
fights or arguments that they had during that year from April of '93 
to April of '94? 
 
A:  I'm sorry.  What? 
 
Q:  Did either one ever tell you about I any fights or arguments that 
they had during that year? 
 
A: Huge fight, no, but I'm sure arguments,  they had arguments. 
 
Q:  you don't recall any major- 
 
A:  A major- 
 
Q -battles between them, 
 
A: No, no major battles. 
 
Q:  In October of '93 there was an incident  when Nicole called 
911. Correct? 
 
A: Oh, yes. Right, yeah. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you about that incident? 
 
A:  She told me that incident the day after  our run, and she said, 
you know, "OJ. got mad at me." 
 
 And I said, "Why?" 
 
"Oh, about those pictures I have in the house." 
 
I says, "You mean all the guys'  pictures." 
 
She says, "Yeah." 
 
Q:  Whose pictures? 
 
A: All the guys.  Nicole has all these  pictures of all the different 
men in her family room, and, see- 
 
Q:  In a photo album? 
 
A: No. It's just like in, what do you call  this, frames. 
 
Q:  And they were laid out on tables 
 
A: Laid out in the living room and the  family room, you know. 
 
Q:  You are saying that when she and  Mr. Simpson decided to 
work things out in April of  '93, she kept those pictures out? 
 
A: Some of them out, yes, but then she put  away most of the solo 
pictures of the different men. 
 
Q:  Put them away? 
 
A: Put them away. 
 
Q:  Okay. 
 
A: But what made OJ. mad was when they were  in-see, what 
Nicole told me and also what OJ. also told me was Nicole went to 
Rockingham and noticed the picture of Paula in the family room, 
and Nicole got  mad at OJ. She said, "You said there won't be any 
more pictures. Why is there a picture of Paula here?. And Nicole 
got mad because the frame that was used was the frame of their 
wedding picture, and so Nicole was upset with that. 
 
So she-they started fighting over  that, and she went home, and OJ. 
went to her house,  and they were already saying-you know, they 
were  fighting. He says, "What's going on? You're telling me not to 
have pictures, and here you have pictures."  And he says, "Look at 
you, look at all these pictures you have." You know, "Who's 
Keith?" And Marcus Allen, whatever.  That's the time-and he was  
yelling. She went upstairs and called 911. 
 
Q:  She told you that- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  -the next day? 
 
A: Yeah, she called me-no, she didn't  tell me about that. I just 
realized that the 911 tape  was when I was watching the video, you 
know, whatever  the testifying. 
 
Q:  I see. So Nicole never told you after  this incident on October 
25, 1993 that it had occurred   to the extent that it did. Right? A: 
Uh-huh, yeah. 
 
Q:  Correct? 
 
A: She didn't tell me about the 911, no. She just told me that they 
had a fight. 
 
Q:  She didn't tell you about the police coming out. Right? 
 
A: No, she didn't tell me. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you that OJ. had broken a door down? 
 
A: She didn't tell me that. 
 
Q:  So based on what she told you, you didn't  regard it as a big 
fight, just an argument. Right? 
 
A: Yeah, well, because the way she told me. 
 
 Q:  So were you surprised when you heard the  tape? 
 
A: Very surprised, yeah. 
 
Q:  Do you have any reason-do you know of  any reason why 
Nicole didn't tell you the truth about  what happened? 
 
 MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
 THE WITNESS: The reason why? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Yes. 
 
A: When I found out, I was shocked.   
 
Q:  You know, what I am asking you is: Given your close 
relationship with Nicole- 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: - do you have any reason or belief why she didn't tell you about 
it? 
 
A: I don't know why she didn't tell me. 
 
Q:  Did she tend to guard things like that and keep them private? 
 
A: Probably, yes, yes. 
 
Q: Was she embarrassed by incidents like  that? 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. Probably. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Now, did you speak to OJ. Simpson 
about  that incident shortly after it occurred? 
 
A:  Yeah, she told-he told me about the  pictures, you know, they 
fought about pictures. He  says, you know "I'm looking at the 
pictures. She's  mad at the pictures, and I go to her house; they've 
got pictures"-"she's got pictures of all the men in  her life, though." 
That's pretty much- 
 
Q: Did he tell you that she had called 911? 
 
A: Did he tell me? 
 
Q:  Yes.   
 
A: He didn't tell me. 
 
Q:  Did he tell you that he had broken a door? 
 
A: He didn't tell me. 
 
Q:  Did he tell you that the police had come out? 
 
A: I didn't know that. He didn't tell me. 
 
Q:  Did Nicole during her divorce proceedings with OJ. Simpson 
tell you that the divorce was-that she was going to settle the case 
rather than go  to court? Did she discuss that with you? 
 
A: No, she didn't discuss that with me. 
 
Q: Do you know that her-a trial in her  divorce case actually 
began? Did you know that? 
 
A: No, I did not. 
 
Q: Did you attend the trial? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she tell you when she had settled  with OJ. Simpson that 
she had done so? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did she tell you why she had done so? 
 
A: Pretty much, yes. 
 
Q: And what did she tell you? 
 
Q:  She told me that she just wanted to end  and that she wanted to 
have a life with [Name Deleted], and   
 
[Name Deleted]has kinda told her that, you know, "Why don't you 
just settle, so that way we can buy a house." You  know, because 
she was planning on living together with [Name Deleted] at that 
time. 
 
Q: Did she tell you that Mr. Simpson pressured her into not 
testifying in court about their relationship? 
 
A: Pressured? 
 
Q:  (Nods head.) 
 
A: No, she didn't tell me about that. 
 
Q: Did she tell you that Mr. Simpson had  discussed with her that it 
would not be wise  financially for the whole family if she testified 
in  court? 
 
A: She didn't tell me that. 
 
Q:  Never discussed any of that with you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she tell you that she was seeing a  therapist named [Name 
Deleted]? 
 
A:  Yes, she told me that. 
 
Q:  Did-she tell you that she was seeing [Name Deleted] at the time 
that she was seeing her, or was  it much later that she told you? 
 
A: No, she told me those-she had two  sessions with that lady-   
 
Q: [Name Deleted]?  
 
A: [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: When did she tell you about [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: During the time that she was seeing- 
 
Q: Okay. And what- A: It was of the early part of '92. 
 
Q:  Correct.  And what did she tell you about [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: She said it was too expensive and she  wasn't getting anything 
from it. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you why she was seeing [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: Because she read this book about obsessive love and she 
thought it was interesting, and  that she said, "Oh, my God, look at 
this," and so that's why she went and contacted the author. 
 
Q: [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: And when she read "Obsessive Love," she  told you that it 
reminded her of things that had  happened in her relationship with 
OJ. Simpson.  Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you-in all the years you knew  Nicole, did you believe her 
to be a dishonest person?   A: Did I who? 
 
Q:  Believe her to be a dishonest person. 
 
A: No. I believed, no. 
 
Q: Do you believe that she was a person who would deceive other 
people or try to deceive other people? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. You answered no. 
 
MR. KELLY:  I'm sorry. I didn't hear the  answer. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Did Nicole tell you that she was 
going to try to deceive OJ. Simpson in order to get money from  
him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Nicole tell you that she was involved   in a scheme, a fraud 
that would be perpetrated on OJ.  Simpson in order to get money 
from him- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:-in order to get out of a prenuptial agreement? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did she ever tell you that she was doing  such things?   
 
A:  She never told me. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Did she tell you that she was going to invent stories of 
abuse about OJ. Simpson in order to assist her ease in the divorce 
proceedings? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Has anyone ever asked you whether Nicole made up stories of 
abuse against OJ. Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did Mr. Simpson ever ask you that at any time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he ever discuss that subject with you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Have you ever heard Mr. Simpson's claim  that Nicole invented 
stories of abuse in order to  deceive him in the divorce case? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Are you aware that he has testified to  that in his deposition? 
 
A: No, I'm not aware of it. 
 
Q:  Okay. Have you read his deposition? 
 
A: No. 
 
 MR. BAKER: That would take a week. 
 
 THE WITNESS: I don't follow these things,   
 
So... 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Okay. Do you believe that Nicole was 
the kind of person who would do such a thing? 
 
A: Do what? 
 
Q: Invent stories- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:-of abuse? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Let him finish his question- 
 
 THE WITNESS: Sorry. 
 
 MR. KRAMER:- and then think about the answer  and then 
answer the question. 
 
 THE WITNESS: If I know the answer.  MR. PETROCELLI: She 
said no, she was not that  kind of person. 
 
Q: Is that your testimony? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Based on your knowledge and experience and your 
relationship with Nicole, if  Nicole wrote down incidents of abuse, 
do you believe  that they occurred? 
 
A: If I believe? 
 
Q: If she wrote them down and described them, would you say that 
she was telling the truth? 
 
A: If it was her writing, yes.   
 
Q: Did she ever tell you about any incident of abuse other than the 
New Year's Eve incident? 
 
A: No. That was the only one. 
 
Q: Did you ever ask her?  A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever ask her, "How many times did OJ. beat you?" 
 
A: No, we never talked about it. 
 
Q: Did she ever ask you whether your husband  beat you? 
 
 MR. BAKER: Irrelevant. 
 
 THE WITNESS: That one? Yes, I said 
 
 BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: I'm sorry.  What- 
 
Q: Did she ever ask you whether your husband  beat you or hit 
you- 
 
A: Oh, me? 
 
Q: Yeah. -or abused you? A: She did ask me. 
 
Q: And what did you tell her? A: I said, "No, never." 
 
Q: When did she ask you? 
 
A: I don't know.  When we go for our runs   
 
and stuff like that. 
 
Q:  Okay. What did she tell you about [Name Deleted], about their 
sessions? 
 
A:  That her sessions were boring and that her sessions were-she 
really didn't help her at all understand and that she couldn't afford 
it. That's  pretty much what she told me. 
 
Q:  Now, you told Barbara Walters that there was a period of time 
when OJ. was following Nicole  and you around. Do you 
remember that? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Now, was that during the period when OJ.  and Nicole were 
going through their divorce? 
 
A: Yeah.  '92. 
 
Q:  In 1992. Correct? A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q:  And could you tell us where OJ. was  following Nicole and you 
around and how he was doing  so? 
 
 MR. KRAMER: Is this different from the  questions of yesterday- 
 
 MR. PETROCELLI: Well, yesterday focused I  think on the '94 
time period in particular. 
 
MR. KRAMER: The two restaurants? 
 
THE WITNESS: But I told you the two.  There   
 
were two-twice that we-that OJ. was there when we got there: One 
was Mezzaluna.  I remember that was  a Tuesday, and we were 
there, and OJ. walked in with a friend, and at that time Nicole-there 
were like a lot of guys sitting, and there was one guy sitting on her 
lap, and when OJ. walked in, he said to Nicole, "Is this what you 
wanted?" and all of a sudden, all the guys just left and- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Who was the guy sitting on Nicole's 
lap? 
 
A: Oh, God, I don't remember.  The bartender-at the time Keith 
was there. 
 
Q:  This is 1992? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q:  And OJ. was upset when he said that? 
 
A: Well, kinda like he was shocked. He  goes, "This is what you 
wanted." 
 
Q:  What does that mean, "This is what you wanted?" 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Well, all the men all over- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  All over Nicole? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q:  And was it just Nicole surrounded by a   
 
bunch of men? 
 
A: Yeah.  Yeah. 
 
Q: Were you there? 
 
A: Well, I was there.  What I was doing, I went to the bathroom, 
and I was there.  I saw all of a sudden all the guys started 
disappearing. 
 
Q:  Where did they go? 
 
A:  They all went into different directions. 
 
Q: When all the men scattered, was Nicole  left alone at the table 
then? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  And what did OJ. say to her at that time? 
 
A:  OJ. just-OJ. was away. OJ. went to  the bar, to the other side. 
 
Q: He only made that one comment, "Is that  what you want, all of 
this?" 
 
A:  "This is all what you want."-"Is this  all what you wanted?" 
 
Q: Okay. Now, is that the only incident  where you think he 
followed her in 1992? 
 
A: That one end then when we went to Tryst. 
 
Q:  Again in 1992? 
 
A: In 1992, yeah. 
 
Q:  Describe that one for us again.   
 
A: Oh, God. We were waiting for our table. That was the opening 
night of that restaurant.  We were waiting at the table-for our table, 
and it was crowded, and all of a sudden, you know, a few minuses 
after OJ. was there, and so Nicole goes, "Guess what? He's 
around." 
 
Q:  Who were you with? 
 
A:  At that time I was with [Name Deleted]; [Name Deleted] was 
there; Keith was there. I think that was  it. 
 
Q:  And then OJ. entered? 
 
A:  OJ. walked in with another friend 
 
Q:  Who was it? 
 
A:  I don't remember.  I don't know the names.  And then he left. 
 
Q: Did he say anything to Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Nothing? 
 
A: See, we were there. I was-we were  kinda like trying to avoid 
him, you know, because we  felt uncomfortable, and said, "Oh, 
God, he's here.." 
 
Q:  Did he see Nicole? 
 
A: He must have seen Nicole. 
 
Q:  Did he say anything to her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he appear upset? 
 
A: Well, we sort of like - they walked in and then he walked out. 
 
Q: Is that all you can remember? A: That's-yeah. A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Now, there was an incident at Toscana's when he threatened 
Alessandro. Correct? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS:  See, I wasn't there. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Did you see him threaten Alessandro? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Were you told that he had done so? 
 
A:  Who told me? 
 
Q:  Anyone. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Nobody told you? 
 
A: No. All I know is she told me that 
 
MR. KRAMER: "She" is who? 
 
THE WITNESS: Nicole said, Guess what?  [Name Deleted] was 
here." 
 
 I said, "Oh, really?"  "Yeah." That was it. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: That's it. Nothing else. 
 
A: Nothing else. 
 
Q:  So you don't know of any threat by OJ. against Alessandro? 
 
A:  No, I don't know anything about that. 
 
Q:  Okay. Now, you gave a statement that Nicole was being 
followed by OJ. in late 1994 or-that is, in May or June of 1994 
while she was doing her errands. Do you recall that? 
 
A: Uh-huh, she told me that. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Tell me what she said in that  regard. 
 
A: She said, "Oh, God, I think I saw OJ.'s  car behind me when I 
was doing all my errands." 
 
 I said, "Oh, really?"  That was it. That was the conversation I had. 
 
Q:  That's it? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Let me get back to your Alessandro  incident. He was a 
hairdresser? 
 
A: Uh-huh, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Let me read your statement that  you gave to [Name 
Deleted] 
 
"We were at Toscana"-  "this hairdresser . . . . at some point when 
we were. . . at Toscana the guy was there.. And he went crazy . . . "  
Does that refresh your recollection as to what you saw that evening 
at Toscana? 
 
MR. BAKER: What page are you on? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: 6-5 and 6. 
 
"And he went crazy . . . " 
 
A:  See, I wasn't there. See, at that time- 
 
Q: That's what you said. 
 
A: Well, see, I wasn't there- 
 
MR. KRAMER:  Cora, the question was, does  that-the reading of 
that statement refresh your  recollection of what happened that 
night and what you  saw? Either it does or it doesn't.  THE 
WITNESS: It doesn't. 
 
 BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Why did you tell Michael Viner that 
OJ.  went crazy? 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Were you lying to him.' 
 
MMR. BAKER: Argumentative 
 
THE WITNESS: See, I don't remember that incident. See, when 
we left there, it must have been Faye and Christian were there, and- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Let me ask you a question: Is  
everything-when you were talking to Michael Viner and the 
gentlemen there from the media, was everything  that you told 
them true to the best of your knowledge at that time? 
 
A: At the time, yes. 
 
Q:  Did you knowingly fabricate anything? 
 
A: Fabricate? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Make it up. Invent. 
 
A: No. I've always- 
 
Q:  Lie. 
 
A: I've never lied, no. 
 
Q:  So everything you told them was truthful. Correct? 
 
A: As far as-yes. 
 
Q:  And if you were under oath that day, you would have said the 
same thing. Correct? 
 
A: Correct, yes. 
 
Q:  And while we are on that topic, we have   pre-marked exhibits 
156, 157 and 158 and 159, which are all statements by you. Okay? 
 
Exhibit 156 is an interview-is a summary of a statement that you 
gave to Detectives LeFall and A.J. Luper on June 14, 1994, and 
Exhibit 157 is a summary of a statement you gave to Detective 
Payne on June 24. The first statement, by the way, is June 14th. 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q:  Exhibit 156 is June 14. Exhibit 157 is June 24. The third 
statement you gave is on  September 15th, 1994, and that was to a 
Detective  Vannatter. 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q:  Exhibit 158 is a summary of that statement.  And Exhibit 159 
is the Star article that  you were paid- 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q:  -for giving an interview. 
 
A:  Uh-huh. 
 
Q:  Okay?  That's Exhibit 159. Now, were all the statements that 
you  gave to the officers and to the Star people truthful? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Hold on just a second. That-I  am going to make a 
distinction in the question,   
 
because I want to make sure the witness is clear. You're asking 
whether what she said at the time to the people was truthful- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Correct. 
 
MR. KRAMER:-you are not asking her whether everything 
contained in those exhibits is what she said. Right? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  I am asking, whatever you said, was 
it not truthful?  Whatever you told the officers and told the Star 
Magazine- 
 
A: As far as I can remember? 
 
Q:  As far as you knew at the time- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  -was it honest and truthful? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  And you didn't say anything that was  untrue to your 
knowledge. Correct? 
 
A: To my knowledge, yes. 
 
Q:  And if you were under oath in all those  interviews and 
statements to the police and to the  Star Magazine you would have 
said the same thing.  Correct? 
 
A:  Okay.  But the Star Magazine is not my words, though.  They-I 
told them the story-   
 
MR. KRAMER: Cora, that's not the question. 
 
THE WITNESS: Okay. BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: If you were 
under oath, you would have told them the same things that you told 
them. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q:  The fact that you were not under oath didn't cause you to lie or 
make things up. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Or with-okay? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I will get back to the statements. I will have 
her read them at a break, and then she can confirm that they're 
accurate things that  she said. Okay? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Fine. 
 
MR. BAKER: Why don't we take a quick break  right now. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Okay.  That's fine. 
 
 THEVIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record  now, and 
the time is approximately 11:20. 
 
 (Recess.) 
 
 THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record  now, and the 
time is approximately 11:45.   
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Did Nicole ever tell you that OJ. 
would spy on her from the bushes outside her apartment at Gretna 
Green? 
 
A:  Bushes? 
 
Q:  Or outside on the property? 
 
A:  I remember one time, yes. 
 
Q:  What did she say to you in that regard? 
 
A:  She said, "Oh, you know, what, Cora?  There was a black man 
by my kitchen door and"- 
 
Q:  At Gretna Green? 
 
A:  Yes.  And she got scared, and at that  time she said, "It looks 
like it's" -"it looks like Jason." 
 
Q:  And it's also true that she told you that  she believed that OJ. 
put Jason up to- 
 
A:  That's what she said. 
 
Q:  -going there. Correct? 
 
A:  Correct. Yes. 
 
Q:  You're cutting me off- 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q:  -So my questions are mishmash. 
 
A: Okay. I'm sorry. 
 
Q:  But she told you that she thought  OJ. Simpson had sent his son 
Jason there to frighten  7 
 
her. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Okay. That was when she was living at Gretna Green? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q:  What's the time frame of that? 
 
A: That's nighttime. 
 
Q: That's a good answer.  That's a good answer. 
 
A: Time frame? When she just- 
 
Q:  Nighttime. 
 
A: When she just moved to Gretna Green, so  early part. 
 
Q: Of 1992? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q:  Did she relate to you any other incidents  during her time at 
Gretna Green when she thought  OJ. Simpson was looking at her or 
spying on her or  hiding in the bushes or anything like that other 
than  the Keith Zlomsowitzh incident? 
 
A:  That was the one, the Keith. 
 
Q:  What about at Bundy? When she moved to  Bundy, did she tell 
you about- 
 
A: Bundy, no. 
 
Q:- any incidents where OJ. would come 
 
Pag 418 and look at her, look in the windows or hide in the 
bushes? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  You don't know anything about that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Did you ever talk to any of her friends about that? A: Of her 
friends? 
 
Q:  Yeah, like Faye Resnick or [Name Deleted]. 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  No? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Never heard of any of that? 
 
A:  No. At that time, no. 
 
Q:  Do you recall the chapter in Faye  Resnick's book called "The 
Bush Syndrome"? Did you  read that chapter? 
 
A: I didn't read the book.  That's why. I  glanced- 
 
Q:  You're not familiar with that chapter? 
 
A: What's it about? 
 
Q: About OJ. Simpson hiding in the bushes. 
 
A: Of where? 
 
Q:  At Bundy. 
 
A: See, I don't know that.   
 
Q: You don't know anything about that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Okay. When you used to run with Nicole, did Nicole carry a 
key with her? 
 
A: Yes. No, we don't, no. We had- 
 
Q: Let me clarify my question. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q:  When Nicole was living at Bundy 
 
A: Uh-huh.  Yes. 
 
Q: - you and she would run together. Would she carry a key on her 
person, either like on a ring finger- a ring with a key  attached to it? 
 
A: She never carried a key. 
 
Q:  Never? 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q:  How did she get in the house? 
 
A: What we do is, when we run, she has a spare key that we-that 
she throws it by the plant by her gate, and we put it there and then 
we run. 
 
Q: Was that key a single key or a key on a  key chain? 
 
A: It's a key on a key chain. 
 
Q:  And can you describe the key chain? 
 
A: God, I don't remember now.   
 
Q: Did she have a little Smoky the Bear key chain? 
 
A: Smokey the Bear. 
 
Q:  Little Smoky the Bear ring with a key attached to it? 
 
A: It was just a round key. 
 
Q:  How many keys were on that? 
 
A: I think two. 
 
Q:  Two? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q:  And what did the keys operate? The front  gate? 
 
A:  Just the front gate and the door. 
 
Q:  Front door? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  And also the back gate? 
 
A: See, the front and the door is one key, I  think, for all- 
 
Q:  One key? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And the back gate was a separate key? 
 
A: See, I don't know the back door because  we never went through 
that back door, so... 
 
Q:  The back gate? 
 
A: The back gate. I assume that that one   
 
key is for the three gates. 
 
Q:  There was one key or two keys on this key chain that she 
would hide under the planter? How many keys? 
 
A: You know what? I think not from my own-I think it's just one, 
because we just throw it in the bushes. 
 
Q: When you would arrive at Nicole's condo at Bundy during the 
period January through June of  1994, would you buzz the gate in 
front? 
 
A: Sometimes I do or sometimes- then when  she gave me a key, I 
just opened it with my key. 
 
Q:  Well, when you used to buzz the gate,  could you describe how 
that worked? 
 
A: How it works? 
 
Q:  Yes.  In other words, there was a doorbell.  Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q:  You would press the button, press the doorbell? 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  And then she could talk to you; there was  a little speaker box? 
 
A:  Yes.  Yes. 
 
Q:  And you said, "This is Cora?   
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  And if she wanted to let you in, how could she let you in? Did 
she buzz it, or did she have to come and open the gate manually? 
 
A:  Sometimes she buzz it.  Sometimes -see, that thing works off 
and on. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't work. 
 
Q:  Okay.  When it's working, how can she let you in from inside 
the condo? 
 
A: She will buzz it and the door will open. It would buzz, and then 
you open- 
 
Q:  You open it. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  But there were times when it wasn't  working. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q:  And when it wasn't working and you didn't  use your key, how 
would she let you in? 
 
A:  She would get out and then open the- 
 
Q:  Go out the front door, walk down to the gate and then have to 
manually open it? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And do you remember whether the buzzer on  the gate was 
working in dune of 1994? 
 
A: If it was working?   
 
Q:  Or whether it was not working. 
 
A:  I don't remember, but it was working off and on. I already told 
you that. 
 
Q:  But do you know if it was working or not working around the 
time of her death? 
 
A:  I don't know that. 
 
Q:  When did you get the key? 
 
A:  When did I get the key? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
A:  Well, she moved in January of '94, so any time after that. 
 
Q:  Sometime after January of '94? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  And under what circumstances would you  use the key? 
 
A:  Because every morning I go there, so it  was easier for me to 
just walk in and out. Plus- 
 
Q:  So when you got the key, you would just  use the key? 
 
A:  Right, yes. 
 
Q:  And then go to her front door and knock  on the door or let 
yourself in? 
 
A:  Sometimes I knock at the door. Sometimes-the door is always 
unlocked, anyway. She  leaves it unlocked, and I would just walk 
in or I use   
 
my key, so... 
 
Q:  During the time she was at Bundy, did Nicole ever tell you that 
she thought OJ. was spying on her at Bundy? 
 
A: She never told me that, no. 
 
Q:  Never? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Did you ever let anybody use the key that Nicole gave you to 
her condo? 
 
A: No. It was always on my key chain. 
 
Q:  Did OJ. Simpson know that you had a key  to that condo? 
 
A: He didn't know. 
 
Q: Did there come a time before Nicole's  death when one of her 
house keys was lost? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  When did that occur? 
 
A:  Around June. 
 
Q:  And tell me what you know about that  incident. 
 
A:  Well, we were gonna go for a run, and  then she noticed that 
her key was missing. She said "Oh, my key is missing. I can't find 
it."  So I said, "Okay, fine, we'll run," So-  but that was the 
conversation that we had.   
 
Q: Was it the same key that she had been using to put under the 
planter? 
 
A:  The one that we would throw in the bushes, yes. 
 
Q:  So what did she then do to get back to the house that day? 
 
A:  Well, it was either my key or we leave it unlocked or-[Name 
Deleted] was there, so- 
 
Q:  It was not a problem. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And do you know whether she ever found  that key before she 
died? 
 
A: I didn't know that. 
 
Q: How long before her death did this  incident occur? 
 
A: What do you mean, "incident"? The key  missing? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: I would say early part of June. 
 
Q: Did she tell you that she thought OJ. might have taken it? 
 
A:  At that time she thought that either OJ.  or Faye, because at that 
time she said "Probably OJ.  has it or and then she said, "probably 
Faye has it." 
 
Q:  Why did she-do you know why she 
 
thought that OJ. might have taken the key? 
 
A: Well, because at the time OJ. was in and out of the house, too, 
because, see, OJ. was feeding-was helping -at that time OJ. was 
helping the kids, too, because he was there most of the time. They 
were trying to reconcile, too, at the time, so he was there. 
 
Q:  Wait a second.  You're trying to tell me that they were trying to 
reconcile in June of 1994? 
 
A: Well, now, he was-see, he was -she had pneumonia at that week 
of- 
 
Q:  That's middle of May. 
 
A:-May. 
 
Q:  You told the police officers that their final breakup occurred a 
week and a half before her  death. 
 
MR. BAKER: Is that a question? A statement? 
 
THE WITNESS: A week and a half? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Yes. You're not suggesting now that 
they were trying to reconcile that week and a half, are you? 
 
A:  No. No, they were not. 
 
Q:  So during that week and a half OJ. wouldn't have permission to 
your knowledge to go onto   
 
Bundy with a key to her house. Right? 
 
A: See, she didn't know that OJ. had a key to the house. 
 
Q:  Is that right? 
 
A:  I'm sorry.  What? 
 
Q:  It's not your understanding that OJ. had permission to have a 
key to Nicole's house during the last week and a half? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  That's - 
 
A:  Yes, that's- 
 
Q:  That's true. Right? 
 
A:  That's true, yes. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you that she was concerned  that OJ. might have a 
key to her house- 
 
A:  Yes, she did mention that, yes. 
 
Q:  -and that she wafted to get it back? 
 
A:  She didn't specify that. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Do you know whether she did  anything to get her key 
back? 
 
A:  She didn't-she didn't tell me that. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Now, during the break you had a chance to review 
exhibits 156, 157, 158, which are all statements that you gave to 
police officers- actually, their reports of your statements.   
 
A:  Uh-huh. 
 
Q:  And 159 is the Star Magazine article for which you were paid 
money. Let's talk about Exhibit 156, June 14 interview with 
Detectives LeFall and A. J. Luper.  Are all the statements reported 
in Exhibit 156 accurate? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Thank you. Exhibit 157 is a report of your interview with 
Detective Payne.  Are all the statements in Exhibit 157 accurate? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Exhibit 158- 
 
MR. KRAMER: I am pointing something-I am calling to the 
attention something to the witness. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Why? She can testify for herself. 
 
MR. KRAMER: That's right. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Thank you.  Exhibit 158 is a report of 
your third  interview with the police, this one with Detective 
Vannatter. That's on September 15th, 1994. Are the   
 
statements on Exhibit 158 accurate? 
 
A:  This- 
 
Q:  Are the statements accurate? 
 
A:  The statements are accurate, right. 
 
Q:  Thank you.  And Exhibit 159, the article with the Star, are the 
statements attributed to you in this exhibit accurate? 
 
A:  Attributed to me? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Is there anything in Exhibit 159 that you  believe is inaccurate? 
 
A:  Inaccurate? This part here (Indicating),  because I was not 
there, so 
 
Q:  The witness is referring to the page 27  of the Star Magazine 
article, the description of the Kris and Bruce Jenner Christmas 
party in December of 1993? 
 
A:  (Nods head.) 
 
Q:  And you are indicating that you were not present? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  So the statements about that party attributed to you are not 
correct?   
 
A: Right. 
 
Q:  Or the observations attributed to you are not correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q:  Okay. Now, what is the reason that you broke off your 
agreement with Brooke Skulski? 
 
A: First, she wanted a sensationalized book, and I said, "I don't 
want a sensationalized book." 
 
She says, "Cora, you have to expose  yourself. You've got to talk. 
Nobody knows you." 
 
That's why I ended up doing that, because she said, "You've got to 
do something or else  nobody"-no publisher will want your book 
because  nobody knows who Cora Fischman is." 
 
And I said no, and that's why I kept on  refusing to-I hold onto that 
one-year contract with  her, but I told her, "I'll just put the book on 
hold,"  because I didn't want a sensational book.  She wanted  a 
sensational book, and I said I wanted to humanize  Nicole; I 
wanted people to know who Nicole was.  That's all I was-that was 
my intention if I wanted  to ever write a book. 
 
Q: Okay. And that was unacceptable to her? 
 
A: She believes that if you do something like this in the tabloid, 
you would-people will   
 
know who I am, and this is exactly what she wanted me to do. 
 
Q:  She wanted you to do the Star Magazine article, and you did 
so. Right? 
 
A: I did so, yeah, but I insisted only if it's a good article. I will not 
do anything that would harm. 
 
Q:  And after you did this article, what then caused you to stop 
working with Brooke Skulski on the  book? 
 
A:  One was because I was subpoenaed, so when you're 
subpoenaed in the criminal, you can't do  anything; you can't talk 
about the case or anything  like that. So that one. Number two, she 
was very opinionated, and  the voice that was coming from her, I 
didn't like the  tone of her voice. It was just too-she-it was  more a 
tabloid, and I didn't want a sensationalized  book. I wanted a book 
that would memorialize my  friend. That's all I wanted. 
 
Q: Is-your lawsuit against the National Enquirer, does that have 
anything to do with Brooke  Skulski? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  What does that have to do with Brooke?   
 
A:  Because of that picture. She is the one, you know, she said, you 
know, "We need pictures." 
 
I said, "Well, what kind of pictures? I don't want"-and I said, 
"Okay, we'll take this picture. It's been in the National Enquirer,  I 
said, "Yeah, my housekeeper stole that picture," and that's when 
the lawsuit came. 
 
Q:  But you authorized the Star to print that picture. Right? 
 
 Was that picture included in the Star Magazine article? 
 
A: Yeah. But they didn't put it on the first page, but they put it on 
the inside page, see,  because they couldn't do that because at that 
time  National Enquirer put it on the front page. 
 
Q:  Before this article came out, the National Enquirer printed- 
 
A:  No.  The same week they had the same  article. One was the 
Christmas story but with my  picture on the National Enquirer. 
Whatever that  family picture, National Enquirer put it on the front  
page and Star put it on the middle page. 
 
Q: Did you agree to do an article for National Enquirer also? 
 
A: No.   
 
Q:  And so what article did National Enquirer do the same week 
about you? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q:  But you had nothing to do with that article? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Did Brooke provide information for that article? 
 
A:  I don't know. I don't think so. 
 
Q:  Did you copyright that photograph?  Did you apply for a 
copyright on that  photograph? 
 
MR. BAKER: Irrelevant. 
 
THE WITNESS: When? At that time? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  No.  At any time 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  How many photographs- 
 
A: How many photographs? 
 
Q: -did you seek to copyright? 
 
A: I don't know. How many photos? 
 
MR. KRAMER: He is asking your knowledge. It's  attached to 
exhibits to the deposition transcript. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  
 
Q:  Why did you seek a copyright on a photograph? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Don't say anything that your lawyers may have 
told you. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  You can't answer because of lawyers? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Let's get beck to the chronology of events in 1993 to 1994. 
Okay? And I was asking you  about whether Nicole and OJ. 
Simpson had ever had any big fights, and you told me you didn't 
know of any at  the time; later on found out about the 911 call.  
Okay? 
 
A:  Okay. 
 
Q:  Now, was there any time at all going into early '94 leading up 
to Nicole's trip to Cabo that she  told you that she did not think 
things were going to work out after all? 
 
A:  As far as I can remember, she said that I  think around February 
of '94. 
 
Q:  What did she say to you then? 
 
A:  She said that-I don't know. It's -I  think it was also-I think it 
was after Cabo.  That  was after the- that's when she decided that 
it's not  gonna work out.   
 
Q:  Did she tell you what caused her to feel that way, that it was 
not going to work out after all? 
 
A:  Because she said, "It's really not fair. OJ. and I, when we see 
each other, we get into each other and then he leaves," and then she 
said she gets  lonely again, and she doesn't like that feeling. So she 
says, "I crave for him. I crave for him." 
 
Q:  So you are saying that she wanted to break off the relationship 
because she didn't want to  be alone so much of the time? 
 
A:  Yes.  Yes. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you about anything that  happened at Cabo that 
disturbed her or upset her? 
 
A: This was one incident where she said,  "Oh, what happened?  
There were"-she said at some  point she felt bored. 
 
 I said, "Why?" 
 
 "Because," she says, "it's so typical, you  know.  Everybody talks 
to OJ., and I'm just sitting  there." 
 
And I said, "What do you mean," you know? "It's like you're like a 
second- class citizen?" 
 
 And she said, "Yeah." 
 
I said, "Well," you know, "that's  what"-"gee, you're married to 
OJ."   
 
Q: Did she tell you that OJ. and she had had an argument or fight 
in Cabo? 
 
A:  No.  Actually, she said they had a great time.  They had a great-
that was-she said that was their best sex. They had a great time. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you that OJ. had upset her about making comments 
concerning frogs? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Frogs? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Frogs. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you know that Nicole had a frog  phobia? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: She told you that? 
 
A: Oh, yes. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you that OJ. was teasing  her about that in Cabo? 
 
A:  It was [Name Deleted]who was teasing her, [Name Deleted]  
 
Q: Who is that? 
 
A: [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q:  [Name Deleted]? You don't mean [Name Deleted], do you? 
[Name Deleted] is the fellow that she   
 
met a year or two before. 
 
A:  Yeah, right, before.  That's how this whole thing started, where 
[Name Deleted]tried to tease-  
 
Q: [Name Deleted]? 
 
A:  [Name Deleted] tried to tease Nicole with the frog and Nicole 
started screaming, or something like that. 
 
Q: But that didn't occur in Cabo in April of '94. Right? 
 
A: No, not in April. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you that OJ. had teased her  about frogs in April 
'94? 
 
A: No, she didn't tell me that. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you that OJ. had been flirting with another woman 
in Cabo? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  She told you that she had had sex with another guy named 
[Name Deleted]in Cabo.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes.  She messed around. 
 
Q:  She messed around.  And to your knowledge, now, this was the  
first time she had been with another man in over a year, since the 
time she decided to make things work with OJ. Simpson. Right? 
 
A:  Uh-huh, yes.   
 
Q:  So weren't you surprised by that? 
 
A:  Yes, I was. 
 
Q:  So did you inquire what happened, "Why did you decide to end 
your reconciliation?. 
 
A:  Well, at that time she was also seeing Marcus Allen. See, 
Marcus Allen was at her house intermittently. You know, not all 
the time. But I told you whenever Nicole-whenever OJ. was out of 
town- 
 
Q: You mean even during the time that Nicole was living at 
Bundy? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And even before the Cabo trip? 
 
A: I think so, yes. 
 
Q: So when did she start to see Marcus Allen  again? 
 
A: You know, I can't-see, sometimes his  name just popped out one 
time and goes, "He just called and I saw him." 
 
 I said, "Oh, really?"  You know, so I really was not paying  
attention to the time frame. 
 
Q:  By this time Marcus Allen was married.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes.   
 
Q:  Marcus had gotten married at  OJ. Simpson's house in August 
of 1993. Right? 
 
A:  June of 19-- 
 
Q:  June of 1993. Right? 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  Now, how long after June of 1993 did Nicole start seeing 
Marcus again? 
 
A:  I don't know. I don't know. 
 
Q:  Now, earlier you had told me that Nicole and OJ. had agreed to 
be monogamous when they decided to reconcile in April of '93.  
Right? 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  And so as far as you know, Nicole  breached that understanding 
and that agreement when  she started to see Marcus Allen when he 
would come  into town when OJ. would go out of town. Right? 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  And is that the only example of that you knew of Nicole 
breaching that agreement with  OJ. Simpson? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  When Nicole would tell you that she would see Marcus, did 
she also tell you that she didn't want  things to work out any longer 
with OJ. Simpson or  that she was still going to try to do that? 
 
Paga440 
 
A:  Yes, she still wanted to work things out with- 
 
Q:  Well, did she tell you why then she was continuing to see 
Marcus Allen from time to time? 
 
A: Well, Marcus Allen kept on coming on to her. 
 
Q: Did they have a strong sexual attraction, Marcus Allen and 
Nicole? 
 
A: Yes.  Yes. 
 
Q: Have you ever spoken to Marcus Allen about any of this? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When Nicole told you that she 
 
had messed around in Cabo with this guy named [Name Deleted], 
she also  told you that at this point in time she didn't think  things 
were going to work out with Mr. Simpson,  right, and she was 
going to try to move on with her  life? 
 
A: She didn't say that yet. She said she's  not ready to be with OJ. 
yet. 
 
Q: I see. But she was going to still try to  pretend that she was 
going to work things out with  him. Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: But then later on when she came back a 
 
while later, she told you that she was going to stop altogether. 
Right? 
 
A: Yeah, right. 
 
Q:  And just so I'm clear on this, can you give me a date when that-
when she told you that it was over for good? 
 
A:  That was when OJ. wrote that letter. 
 
Q:  Around that time? 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  That's when she told you it's over for good? 
 
A:  She says, "I don't want to"-yes. 
 
Q:  Is that the first time that she told you that that was it; she wasn't 
going to try to work things out any longer with him.' 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: But by that time wasn't she going out  with girlfriends and 
dating and going partying with  [Name Deleted] and Ron 
Goldman? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  But that's not something she was doing  earlier, before her trip 
to Cabo. Right., 
 
A:  Before her trip to Cabo? 
 
Q:  Yeah. She wasn't going out with other  men?   
 
A:  No, she wasn't going- 
 
Q:  So her behavior after Cabo changed considerably.  Correct? 
 
A:  Oh, wait a minute. She was seeing another man around... I'm 
trying to keep my... February she met somebody. 
 
Q:  February of 1994, the year that she died. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And who did she meet? 
 
A: [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: And who is [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: [Name Deleted] is a friend of [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q: Okay.  And tell me about this  relationship. 
 
A:  We met-it was actually February-it  was March now, around- 
 
Q:  Before Cabo. 
 
A:  Yes, before Cabo, because we went  shopping.  Yeah, March of 
1994. Nicole and I were  shopping for clothes at Brentwood 
Gardens, and these two guys kept following us, and one of the 
guys  introduced herself-himself to Nicole, and that was  [Name 
Deleted]. 
 
Q:  And who was the other person? 
 
A:  I don't know.   
 
Q:  Was it Ron Goldman? 
 
A:  I don't know. 
 
Q:  By this time you had never met Ron Goldman. Right? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  And Nicole hadn't either to you knowledge. Right? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q: And what then happened between Mike Davis  and Nicole? 
 
A: Mike-Nicole was very attracted to Michael, and she told me that 
she liked that guy. 
 
 "He's really cute." So that was-and she kind of  pursued Michael, 
but Michael-when Michael found out  that she was OJ.'s ex-wife, 
that's when, you know,  she - you know, he stopped-kinda like 
backed off a  little bit, but Nicole still continued pursuing  [Name 
Deleted]. 
 
Q:  And how old was [Name Deleted]? 
 
A:  Michael's 24. 
 
Q:  What did he do? 
 
A:  He's a trainer. 
 
Q:  Where? 
 
A:  At The Gym. 
 
Q: That's the name of a health-   
 
-The Gym. 
 
-club in Brentwood called The Gym.' 
 
A: The Gym. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And he's a trainer there? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Did she have a romantic relationship with [Name Deleted]? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  How long did that last? 
 
A:  Not really a romantic relationship, but- 
 
Q:  They had sex? 
 
A:  Is that what you call it, sex, oral sex?  I don't know. What do 
you call it?  I don't know. 
 
MR. KELLY: Push that a little bit, Dan. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Yeah, I would call oral sex sex, if 
that's what you're asking me. 
 
A:  Okay. 
 
Q:  They had oral sex 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  --is that what you're telling us? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And how do you know that? 
 
A:  Because Nicole told me. 
 
Q:  They had oral sex on more than one occasion? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Did she say that that's all they had together? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And, now, when Nicole was having this relationship 
with [Name Deleted], did you ask her what did this mean in terms 
of her relationship with  OJ. Simpson, whether she was growing 
disenchanted with that relationship, why she was doing this? 
 
A:  Well, she said that she was getting old  and that she-she says, 
you know, "Core, when we're  50 years old, nobody's gonna look 
at.  Look at  this." You know, she says-I think she was  fascinated 
by young men being attracted to her.  You know, she liked that 
feeling. 
 
 MR. PETROCELLI: Why don't we break here for  lunch.

EXAMINATION (Resumed) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  I would like to have-or have had  
marked during the break, I should say, the next  exhibit in order, 
Exhibit 161, which is your  deposition 
 
in the case against the National Enquirer,   
 
and that's the only other document that you have found responsive 
to our subpoena. Is that correct? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  You don't have the Brooke Skulski pages? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Exhibit 162 is a photograph of a key.  Do you recognize the 
key depicted in that photograph? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Is that-what is it? 
 
A: It's my key. 
 
Q: It's the key that Nicole gave you to her  condominium, 875 
Bundy? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Exhibit 163, do you recognize it? It's a  photograph of, as you 
can see, two keys on a key  chain. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  What are the keys that you see depicted  in Exhibit 163? 
 
A:  These are the keys that-what do you  call them-the detective 
showed me. 
 
Q:  Are those the keys that Nicole would put under her planter- 
 
Q:-when she would go jogging-  
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  -when she lived at Bundy? A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  You talked about that before. Right?  You talked about that 
earlier today, that she would put the two keys on a key chain in a 
planter in front on her condominium when you and she would go 
off running when she lived at Bundy. Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And those are the keys that you see in Exhibit 163. Correct? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Thank you. These keys were found in OJ. Simpson's  
possession when he was arrested on June 17. Do you  know how 
they got there? 
 
A:  I don't know. 
 
Q:  These keys, the ones depicted in Exhibit 163, are the keys that 
Nicole told you were  missing in the last days of her life. Correct? 
 
A:  That's the key, then. 
 
Q: Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Did Nicole ever tell you about an  incident concerning Mr. 
Simpson's maid Michelle? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Relate that incident to us. Excuse me. Tell us what Nicole told 
you about that incident. 
 
A: She slapped Michelle, and Michelle fell on the floor, because 
she couldn't stand her. 
 
Q:  Who couldn't stand whom? 
 
A:  Nicole couldn't find-couldn't stand Michelle. 
 
Q:  Nicole told you that she just walked up to Michelle and 
knocked her down to the floor? 
 
A:  Oh, no, no.  They had an argument. They had an argument 
about-at the time they had an  argument about the kids wanting to 
play inside, and  Michelle doesn't like the kids inside because the 
house will get dirty, you know, and they had a heated  
conversation, and then what Nicole did was slap  Michelle, and 
Michelle fell on the floor. 
 
Q:  What happened then? 
 
A:  What happened then? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
A:  She called me that day and she said, "Don't tell anybody about 
this, but," you know, "I  just couldn't stand Michelle, and 
Michelle's a crazy  woman, and I just slapped her. I couldn't stand 
the  way she talked to me." And that was it. And then 
 
Michelle left- 
 
Q:  Because of that incident? 
 
A:  Pretty much that incident, too, you know. 
 
Q:  And she knew that-Michelle knew that OJ. and Nicole were 
still seeing each other and that Nicole might move back in the 
house? 
 
A:  Right.  See, one of the reasons why Nicole told me she didn't 
want to move there unless-unless Michelle lives there , because 
Michelle  and Nicole couldn't get along well. 
 
Q:  So Nicole wanted Michelle to leave before she moved back? 
 
A:  Exactly. 
 
Q:  And did you ever talk to OJ. Simpson  about this? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what did OJ. say? 
 
A:  Well, OJ. thought that Nicole was wrong  in doing that, 
because at the time he told me that she  doesn't have -"Nicole 
doesn't have the right to slap  Michelle because," he said, you 
know, "I'm paying this  woman, not Nicole. This is my 
housekeeper, not Nicole's.. So pretty much that's what- 
 
Q:  Did Mr. Simpson say to you that he would  ask Michelle to 
leave if Nicole moved back into the 
 
Pag 451 
 
house? 
 
A:  Well, it kinda worked out that way already because Michelle at 
that time said, "I'm not gonna work for Mrs. Simpson," you know. 
 
Q:  For whom? 
 
A:  Mrs. Simpson. 
 
Q:  "Mrs. Simpson," meaning Nicole? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  So Michelle, based on your understanding,  was anticipating 
Nicole's moving back into the house? 
 
A:  Right, uh-huh. 
 
Q:  And OJ. Let her go? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So OJ. didn't tell her, "Don't leave  because Nicole's not moving 
in." He never said that to her to your knowledge.  Right? 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: No- 
 
MR. KRAMER: Do you have any knowledge one way  or the 
other? 
 
THE WITNESS: If what? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Whether this conversation took  place between 
Mr. Simpson and Michelle. 
 
THE WITNESS:  Well, no, I don't know that  conversation. I'm 
sorry. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Who is [Name Deleted]? 
 
A:  [Name Deleted] is the bartender of one of the clubs that was 
very attracted to Nicole, and that's pretty much, you know-as 
Nicole calls-Nicole  called [Name Deleted] the freeloader. 
 
:Q:  Why? 
 
A:  Because every time they went on vacation he was there, and he 
got everything free. 
 
Q:  From whom' 
 
A:  All the trips when they went to Cabo, he  was there. 
 
Q:  Who paid his way? 
 
A: Who paid? 
 
Q:  How did he go there for free? 
 
A: Well, when Nicole went to Cabo, I mean everything was paid 
for, so it was like he was there. I mean, he didn't pay for the hotel 
or the villa. 
 
Q: You mean he stayed there for free? 
 
A:  Exactly. 
 
Q:  And he was Nicole's friend? 
 
A:  Pretty much, yes. 
 
Q:  And how long did Nicole know [Name Deleted]? 
 
A:  I don't know. 
 
Q:  A year or more?   
 
A:  Excuse me? 
 
Q:  A year or more? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And were you friendly with him also? 
 
A: No. I knew of him, but I wasn't  friendly. 
 
Q:  Okay. Before the break we were talking about [Name Deleted]. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  And I had asked you earlier whether Marcus Allen was the 
only breach of Nicole's  understanding with OJ. about being 
monogamous during  the reconciliation period, and you said yes. 
Then  later on you told me about another person with whom she 
had sex; namely, [Name Deleted]. 
 
A: Well, you know, it just- 
 
Q:  You didn't remember? 
 
A:  I didn't remember, and then as we got  along, you know- 
 
Q:  Are there any other persons now that you  may remember that 
you didn't tell me about before? 
 
A: That's it. 
 
Q:  Is that it? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Now, do you know whether  
 
OJ. Simpson knew about Mike Davis? A: No, he doesn't know 
about Mike Davis. 
 
Q: Did you ever tell him about it? A: No. 
 
Q: At any point in time? A: No. 
 
Q:  Up to today? 
 
A: Well, you know, about the book, yes. He asked me about that 
"Brentwood Hello," so... 
 
Q:  Is Mike Davis the person who is mentioned in the book when it 
discusses the "Brentwood Hello? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  So that occurred in the 1994 time period? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  I see.  How do you know that that person  in the book in the 
discussion of the "Brentwood Hello"  incident is Mike Davis? 
 
A:  Because Nicole told me.  And also I- after Nicole- 
 
Q:  Nicole called it the "Brentwood Hello"?  She used that 
terminology to you? 
 
A: No. Faye used that. I was just  surprised when I read about that 
in the book. 
 
Q:  So how do you know it's the same  incident, is what I'm getting 
to?   
 
A:  How come it's the same incident? 
 
Q:  How do you know that it is the same incident? 
 
As I understand the reference in the book, there was a person that 
Nicole didn't even know and just went into this guy's apartment 
and had oral sex with somebody. 
 
A: Exactly.  That's him. 
 
Q: But she knew Mike Davis. 
 
A:  She didn't know [Name Deleted]. We just  met [Name Deleted] 
around March. 
 
Q:  Yeah? 
 
A:  I mean, Nicole didn't just walk into a  stranger's house and do 
the act. 
 
Q:  So this was Mike Davis, then. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And what happened to stop the Davis relationship?  How 
did that come to an end? 
 
A:  There was really no relationship. 
 
Q:  Just sex? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Was it clear in your mind, as of the time  of this Mike Davis 
incident together with the Marcus  Allen situation, that Nicole 
really wasn't going to be  getting back together with Mr. Simpson 
on a permanent   basis? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: On a permanent basis? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Yeah.  Was it becoming clear to you 
that that was not going to happen? 
 
A:  I don't know. I can't answer that. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you that it was unlikely that she was going to move 
back in at that point in time? 
 
A: She told me she was not reedy to move  back in. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you that she had told 
 
Mr. Simpson that she wasn't ready? 
 
A: I think she was thinking about mentioning it to him. 
 
Q:  And do you know when she first told him/ 
 
A: I think when she returned the bracelet,  that's when she told OJ. 
 
Q:  I am going to be asking you some  questions from the 
statement that you have made to  Michael Viner and the people 
from the National  Enquirer that was recorded on tape. 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q:  You've already told us everything that   you said was true to the 
best of your knowledge, but I want to follow up on a couple of 
specific topics. 
 
Do you have a copy of this? 
 
MR. BAKER: I do. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am going to be - the page references that I 
will mention will be to the District Attorney's transcription of that 
interview. Okay? 
 
Q: On page 2, you say, referring to OJ. Simpson: 
 
 ...this guy did everything. He  kept on saying he's 47 years old  
and don't wanna have another family, he just wanted to be with  
Nicole." 
 
A: Wanted-yes. 
 
Q:  And that's what OJ. Simpson told you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  When did he tell you that? 
 
A: During one of our conversations, you  know. 
 
Q:  Told you that more than once? 
 
A:  I would say yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. You also on page 3 of the transcript, you mention that 
Nicole told you she lost  her self-worth and identity.   
 
Is that something Nicole told you? 
 
A: We talked about it. We talked about it, how you lose your 
identity being with this powerful men. It's sort of like we became a 
shadow of our husbands. 
 
Q: And that's how Nicole told you she felt? 
 
A: Yes. \When she was living with and married to OJ. Simpson 
and she had felt that she had lost her  self worth and identity? 
 
A: Well, I didn't say-we- 
 
Q:  Is that- 
 
A: We talked about it. 
 
Q:  And that's what she told you, that that's  how she felt. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  You indicate at page 5 of this transcript  that: 
 
 "...Nicole had a lot of friends.  She thought she had a lot of 
friends. When she moved out all of  them disappeared, they all 
went to  OJ." You are talking about the time when Nicole got 
divorced from OJ. Correct?   
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  And who were the friends that left? 
 
A: That didn't stop talking? Well, like Linda Schulman, she was 
very friendly with Linda Schulman, and she was hurt by the 
breakup of that relationship, and, you know, a few people. I mean, 
I don't know the other friends. 
 
Q:  Linda Schulman is one of the people you had in mind? 
 
A:  Yeah.  Yeah. 
 
Q: And anybody else who abandoned Nicole and  went to OJ. 
when Nicole and OJ. split up? 
 
A: Well, you know, they had a lot of friends, but she kept on 
mentioning about, "Most of my  friends who I thought were my 
friends all went to OJ." 
 
Q: Can you name any of them besides Linda  Schulman? 
 
A:  I can only name Linda Schulman because  she's the only one I 
knew. 
 
Q:  At page 6 you state that when 
 
Nicole  was-after she and OJ. separated and were divorced: 
 
 "...I know OJ. wanted to know more  about Nicole, whatever 
Nicole was  doing with me because he knew I was   
 
out...with her" That's true, that OJ. would waft to find out from you 
what Nicole was doing. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  You say on page 7 that when Nicole, again, got 
divorced: 
 
"...nobody supported her, even her  family.  The family didn't talk 
to her, nobody was there for her, and  she felt really bad about it." 
Is that what she told you? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Now we are back in the May and June of  1994 time frame, 
right before Nicole's death. We're  talking about this IRS letter and- 
 
 MR. BAKER: What page? 
 
 MR. PETROCELLI: Page 17. 
 
 BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  -and you say: 
 
 "I think part of the reason why  OJ. was so upset with Nicole was 
OJ called Nicole ...- Nicole called _ OJ. and said, 'How  dare you 
buy my...friends? How  come you're buying my friends?' -   
 
"The reason why she said that was because...OJ. wrote a check  
to...Christian for five thousand and something." 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  Okay. Is that what Nicole told you? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And did OJ. also tell you that? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you have a conversation with OJ. about this? 
 
MR. BAKER: Which part? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  About the part that Nicole was so 
upset  with him and he was upset with her because- 
 
A:  Oh, yes, OJ. told me about that. 
 
Q:  Okay. Now relate that conversation to me. 
 
A: Well, he told me that the 5,000 was- they were doing a 
business, and Faye also told me  this, that they were doing a 
business venture about  some pills or whatever, vitamins or 
whatever.  I don't  remember.  Or jet lag pill, something like that, 
and  that was the $5,000. 
 
Q:  But OJ. Simpson told you that he was   
 
very upset with Nicole at this point in time.  Right? 
 
A:  Yes, because he said, you know, "Why does she think I'm 
buying her friends?  I'm not buying her friends. Faye was the one 
who invited herself to go to that sports spectacular." 
 
Q:  And OJ. told you that Nicole had called him up and was 
screaming at him about this. Right? 
 
A: Yes.  And he thought that she was being unfair. 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: Who's being unfair? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  OJ. told you that he didn't think 
Nicole  was being "fair with him. Correct? 
 
A: Being fair with him' 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: He didn't think it was his fault, in other words. Right? 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. I'm lost. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  OJ. told you that he didn't do 
anything wrong; nothing was his fault; Nicole had no right to  be 
upset with him.   
 
A: Right. 
 
Q:  That's the substance of what he told you Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q:  And you say at page 19 on the same subject, "And so she," 
referring to Nicole, "called OJ. and said to OJ., 'How dare you buy-
you buy everything.  You took my friends away, took my family,'" 
blank, "important in her life," I guess  meaning everything 
important in her life. 
 
Is that what Nicole told you? 
 
A: Pretty much, yes. 
 
Q:  On page 20, referring to the recital, you indicate that your 
husband, Ron Fischman, talked to  OJ. Simpson at the recital. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  What did Ron tell you that he said to your husband-to OJ. 
Simpson at the recital? 
 
A:  What they talked about is - when I said  they talked, is they 
talked because they were gonna have pictures taken, but other than 
that, I don't know  what they talked about, so... 
 
Q:  On page 24. On page 24 of your  transcript, you are talking 
about Nicole's feelings  concerning the beating in 1989.   
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q:  And you say: "...that was the only one that I know, 'cause she 
really never talked about it, she felt embarrassed, she felt that 
nobody should know about these things." Is that what Nicole told 
you? 
 
A:  She told me she was embarrassed, yeah, with that '89 incident. 
 
Q:  And she told you that she felt that  nobody should know about 
these things? 
 
A: She felt funny, yes. 
 
Q:  She felt ashamed? 
 
A: Kinda felt funny because she felt that it was her fault. 
 
Q:  Okay. Did she tell you that this was the sort of thing she was 
not comfortable telling people; this was private? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you she was ashamed of the  incident? 
 
A: No. She said she was just embarrassed. 
 
Q:  Embarrassed? 
 
A: Yeah.   
 
Q:  Okay.  Page25.  You're talking about the Gretna Green incident 
in October of 1993. 
 
MR. KRAMER:  Do you know the incident to which he is 
referring? 
 
THE WITNESS: The 911? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Yeah. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Okay. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  "See what happened"-this is you  
talking: 
 
 "See, what happened is Nicole is so  afraid of OJ.'s voice. OJ.  
when...he's upset, I mean, he is  really -he's got a very bad  temper.  
And, in fact, Nicole said  to OJ., 'If you really went this  marriage 
to work out you're gonna  have to go to therapy to control  your 
anger.'   And OJ. said, 'Yeah, I'm  going to. I'm working on it, I'm  
working on it."' 
 
A: That's what Nicole told me, yes. Nicole  told me that. 
 
Q:  And did you talk to OJ. about that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q;  When you said, "And OJ. said, 'Yeah, I'm going to. I'm 
working on it, I'm working on it.'" 
 
A: That's what Nicole told me. 
 
Q: That OJ. said? 
 
A: That was their conversation, yeah. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Page 27. 
 
Q: Concerning the reason for the beating on  New Year's Eve 1989, 
you mentioned on page 27 of this transcript that the reason why 
that happened was  because of a "pair of earrings." 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  Can you tell us what Nicole told you  about that incident? 
 
A:  She sew those pair of earrings and she thought it was hers, and 
then when she asked OJ. or  something like that, she found out it 
wasn't really hers, but it was for another woman. 
 
Q:  Named? 
 
A:  I don't know. 
 
Q: Tawny Kitaen? 
 
A: She didn't mention. 
 
Q:  Okay.  If you told Michael Viner and the  National Enquirer 
that it was Tawny Kitaen, would that be accurate? 
 
A:  Well, at the time they were mentioning Tawny Kitaen, so I 
would assume, but I'm not sure. 
 
Q:  Okay. Page 28.  You were talking here about OJ. Simpson's 
statement in his suicide letter that he was a battered spouse, and 
you were asked  about that, and you said: 
 
"Because Nicole didn't know what to do. First, she'd want to go 
back to the rely on  --that she wanted to go back to the relationship.  
Then she would say...I mean, like they went to -we went to Super  
Bowl.  She said, 'Oh, I have to be  nice now to OJ. or else, you 
know,  we won't go. I mean, you know, for  you I'll be nice because 
we're all  going to the Super Bowl.' Things  like that."  Is that what 
Nicole told you? 
 
A: Well, on our run we kid around. I mean,  she said, "I'd better be 
nice to him," you know,  because she'd never been to a Super 
Bowl. Yeah, she  mentioned that. It's all there. 
 
MR. KELLY: I'm sorry. I couldn't hear that.   
 
THE WITNESS: I said it's all there, I said. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Talking about Nicole's not willing to 
make a commitment to OJ. Simpson, on page 30, talking about 
Nicole going through a phase, and Nicole says, "You know, Cora, 
well, I'm just going through a phase in my life." And now you 
continue: "And I remember OJ. used to say,  'Oh, Nicole, you're 
going '- 'you're gonna go through this, I  wonder-'he says, 'I don't 
know  if I can go through when you turn  40, you know: ... He'd 
kid around.  He says, 'You're only 35, and look what happened, 
you don't even wanna be with me 'cause I'm old:" 
 
A: Yeah, it's true. 
 
Q: Is that what OJ. told you? 
 
A: No. That was the conversation- I was  there when we used to 
kid around about our age and  stuff, yeah. 
 
Q:  What I want to know is whether you- 
 
A: No. Nicole told me that. 
 
Q:  OJ. Simpson told you none of that?   
 
A: No.  See, he didn't tell me, but that was like the-when we were 
together, that was the conversatioin. 
 
Q:  When you were together with whom' 
 
A:  With OJ. and Nicole. 
 
Q:  And you would hear OJ.- 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  -say, "Oh, Nicole you're gonna go through this.  I don't know if 
I can go through when  you turn 40"? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  "You're only 35 and look what  happened. You don't 
even wanna be with me because I'm  old." 
 
A: Exactly. 
 
Q:  Those are statements that OJ. made in  your presence to Nicole. 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  Okay. Now, later on on the same page,  page 30, you say: 
 
"I felt like he," referring to  OJ. Simpson, "was abused too is  
because she kind of destroyed him to a point where like she really 
is  saying, 'How dare you. You're too 
 
  
 
old, you know, I don't wanna be  with you anymore. You know, 
you're  no fun to be with:" 
 
A:  Yeah, Nicole said that. 
 
Q:  And then you quote OJ. as saying: "Hey, listen, I'm 47-okay, 
my knees start cracking, okay, but I've worked hard, I used to 
(blank) you know, when I was 29 I was...all tight." 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  OJ. used to say that? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  In your presence? 
 
A:  Yeah, we had that conversation. 
 
Q:  On page 33 you're referring to a big  fight that you had with 
Nicole about I guess Marcus  Allen. 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q:  And you state, beginning at line 13:  "...well, what happened 
was...I  confirmed to OJ. that I knew it.  And 'cause-and OJ. didn't 
like  the fact that, uh, people knew  about the affair because OJ. 
thought that it was just him and Nicole who knew about the affair. 
It turned out we knew. 
 
"And I said, "Well, don't worry about that, you know, I won't say 
anything: "Nicole confronted me on that one and I didn't like it the 
way she confronted me.  And I said,  'Listen (blank) "But that was 
it.  It wasn't, you know, a major fight  
 
"And Nicole is tough.  I mean,  she can scream.  Well, she has also 
a bad temper." 
 
Q:  When did that occur? 
 
A: That was when Nicole told OJ. about her  relationship with 
Marcus Allen. 
 
Q:  When they began to reconcile? 
 
A:  Exactly. 
 
Q:  And then OJ. Simpson called you up and  got upset with you 
because you knew or-You said  you-   
 
A: No. -confirmed to OJ.- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  -that you knew. That's what you said here. 
 
A:  During one of our conversation he did ask me- 
 
Q:  Who? 
 
A: OJ. 
 
Q:  What did he ask you? 
 
A: Oh, no, you know what? I know what  happened there. I was 
upset because Nicole got mad at  Ron at the time- 
 
Q:  Ron who? 
 
A: Ron Fischman, because OJ. spoke to Ron  about their 
reconcilliation, and when OJ. mentioned about Marcus Allen, Ron 
did not confirm or deny. And what happened was Nicole got upset  
that Ron knew about the Marcus Allen, and so Nicole  confronted 
me. She says, "Why"-you know,  "Why did  you tell Ron," or, 
"Why did Ron tell Marcus Allen"- 
 
Q:  Why did Ron tell who? 
 
A:  "Why did Ron tell OJ?" And that was pretty much the gist of 
the conversation. 
 
Q:  And did you talk to OJ. Simpson about- 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:-the fact that you knew? 
 
A: No, I don't think so. 
 
Q:  So you said in the transcript, "I  confirmed to OJ. that I knew it. 
 
A: Must be. I don't know. I don't remember. 
 
Q:  Can you recall anything about that conversatioin with OJ. 
Simpson? 
 
A: I must have told him. I don't know. I'm pretty sure. 
 
Q:  And did he tell you that he was upset  with you that you knew? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: No, he was not upset with me.  Nicole was upset 
with me. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Was Mr. Simpson upset with Nicole 
that  you knew? 
 
A:  Yes, I think so. 
 
Q:  And did he tell you- 
 
A:  That other people knew about their affair. 
 
Q: Mr. Simpson told you he was upset because  other people knew 
about the affair?   
 
A: No. Nicole was upset with me, not OJ. Nicole was upset with 
me. 
 
Q: But I am trying to find out what OJ. Simpson said to you about 
this. Okay? When you spoke to him about this, did he tell you that 
he was upset that other people knew? 
 
A:  No.  Nicole told me that. 
 
Q:  Told you what? 
 
A:  That OJ. was upset with her that other  people knew about the 
affair. Okay.  And did you confirm that when you  spoke to OJ. 
Simpson about this? 
 
A:  I don't remember. You know, that's pretty much... 
 
Q:  You don't remember? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  At page 36 you're talking about the early  years of Mr. 
Simpson's relationship with Nicole, and you said in the interview 
with Mr. Viner, "And I  remember OJ. used to say, 'I remember 
when Nicole was 17, I molded her.'" That's what OJ. Simpson told 
you. Right? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  No? 
 
A:  That's not what OJ. Simpson said. 
 
Q:  That's what you said here. 
 
A:  That's what Ron used to tell me.  "I molded you. " So I must 
have used that term to- 
 
Q: You deny that? A: Yes, I deny- 
 
Q:  You deny that OJ. Simpson told you that "I remember when 
Nicole was 17, I molded her"? 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative and asked and  answered. 
 
THE WITNESS:  That's not true. I'm referring  to myself in that 
one. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: What do you mean, you are referring 
to  yourself? 
 
A:  Ron and I used to kid around about how-you know, Ron used 
to kid around with me.  He says, "I molded you," so I must have 
used the word molded"  with that, yeah, but Nicole was 17 when- 
 
Q:  Well, did OJ. Simpson tell you, "I  remember when Nicole was 
17, I molded her"? 
 
A:  No, that's not true, so I will deny that. 
 
Q:  Let me read on. Line 15: 
 
A:  Yeah, she screamed at me in that. She  got mad at me and-yeah, 
that's true. "And I actually blame OJ. for this.  I spoke to OJ. at 
some   point and said, 'You know, it's actually your fault, you 
molded this woman (blank) you know. You exposed her to this 
lifestyle."' 
 
A:  Yes, I must have mentioned that to OJ., yes. 
 
Q:  So that is true, then. 
 
MR. BAKER: What's true? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: That you had this conversation with 
OJ. about OJ. molding Nicole. 
 
A: OJ. did not tell me that he molded  Nicole. I'm-I used that word 
"molded." Know what I'm saying? 
 
Q:  No, I don't. Right in here you told  Mr. Viner that OJ. Simpson 
said, "I remember when Nicole was 17, I molded her," and you're 
now denying  that OJ. Simpson said that? 
 
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: I already told you that word "molded" came from 
Ron, and I always talk about how he  molded me because I met 
Ron when I was young, so-but OJ. never told me about that. Yes, 
OJ. told me that he met Nicole when  he was 17, how she looked 
so pretty and she was 17 and   didn't know anything.  Yes, so I 
must have used the word "molded" from that, but OJ. didn't tell me 
that. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: So you made all that up in here? 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  You made this all up? This whole 
paragraph is invented by you? 
 
A:  I don't think that's invented, but the  gist of the situation is 
there. I mean-you know. 
 
Q:  No, I don't understand why it's there.  Explain it to me. 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, that's not a question. It doesn't matter if you 
understand anything. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Do you understand the question? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Here, why don't you read what you 
said.  Okay? I would just like you to confirm that what-that that is 
true. 
 
MR. KRAMER: From what line to what line would you like her to 
read? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: 13. 
 
MR. KRAMER: From line 13 on page 36. 
 
THE WITNESS: OJ. didn't say that. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Read on. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Well, read it. Why don't you just take a moment 
and read from line 13 down. 
 
(Witness reviews document.) 
 
MR. KRAMER: Okay? You read it? 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  So is it true what you said in the  
interview as reported here? 
 
MR. BAKER: What's true? 
 
THE WITNESS: I didn't use the word "molded "  I mean, no, OJ. 
didn't say -use the word "molded,"  no. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  And so you never blamed OJ.  You 
never  said, "you know, it's...your fault, you molded this woman." 
You never said that?" 
 
A:  Probably said that because I was mad.  I don't know. But I 
never used the word "molded,"  that he molded -I used the word 
"molded," but OJ.  did not say that, "I molded." 
 
Q:  So OJ.-what- 
 
A:  Must have used another word, but 
 
Q:  What you said here is false, then. Right?   
 
A:  Then we'll say false. 
 
Q:  So that was false.  Okay?  And also false is that you blamed 
OJ., said, "It's...your fault, you molded this woman." That's also 
false? 
 
A:  See, I remember I made that statement to him, so I remember 
that. 
 
Q:  You made what statement to him? 
 
A:  That I said, you know, "You molded Nicole  for who she was." 
 
Q:  And what did he say in response to that? 
 
A:  I don't remember. 
 
Q:  Did he agree or disagree? 
 
A:  I think that that was a conversation that  I had with him when 
he was in jail, so if he did that-if he-I didn't see his reaction, so... 
 
Q:  Why not? You were on the phone? 
 
A:  Over the phone, yeah. 
 
Q:  Did he disagree or agree with your  statement? 
 
MR. BAKER:  You've asked her that twice now. 
 
THE WITNESS:  He didn't-I didn't see his  reaction. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Well, what did he say?   
 
A: He didn't disagree, so I don't know. There was silence. 
 
Q:  Okay. So he didn't say to you, "No, that's wrong. That's false. 
That's untrue. I never molded her"? 
 
A: No, he didn't say anything like that. 
 
Q:  Okay. And why did you think that he had molded Nicole? 
 
A:  Because I felt that-well, this is what  I feel about the whole 
thing: Like she was young and-you know, she was 17, and then she 
led a life  with OJ. 
 
Q:  And did you also tell OJ., "You made her  exactly like you"? 
 
A:  I must have told-yeah, I must have  told him that. 
 
Q:  And that's what you believed. Right? 
 
A:  I felt at that time, yeah, exactly. 
 
Q:  Have you ever spoken to Sydney Simpson about her-about the 
evening of June 12? 
 
A:  The evening of June 12? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Which day of the week was June 12? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: The evening of June 12 when her 
mother   was killed, did you speak to her about what she heard and 
whether her mom had received any phone calls? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Never spoken to her about that? A:  No. 
 
Q:  Or do you know if Mr. Simpson has? 
 
A:  I don't know. 
 
Q:  Did you ever ask him. A: No. 
 
Q:  Did you ever ask him, "Have you spoken to Sydney and what 
did she hear?" 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you ever speak to Justin about that? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Do you know whether Mr. Simpson has? 
 
A:  I don't know. 
 
Q:  Have you ever asked him? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you know that there was a knife found on Nicole's counter 
that evening? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
MR. BAKER: Irrelevant. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Excuse me. 
 
A: I don't know.   
 
Q:  Did you ever ask Mr. Simpson about that knife? A: I don't 
know. 
 
Q:  Did you ever see Mr. Simpson's video? 
 
A: What video? 
 
Q:  You know, the video that he has been selling for money to try 
to convince people that he's innocent. 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: Oh, that was a beautiful question. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: You've never seen that video? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, yesterday you were explaining to us  why OJ. Simpson 
was innocent: Because things didn't match. You know, there's no- 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q:-blood on the carpet- 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q:-and things like this.  Do you remember that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What about the fact that there was  OJ. Simpson's blood found 
at Nicole's condo?   
 
MR. BAKER:  What's the question? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Do you have an explanation for that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Do you know of any reason why that blood was found there? 
 
A:  Well, I felt there was a vial missing. Wasn't there?  See, I didn't 
follow because I was not allowed to watch the whole thing. 
 
Q:  Well, you said yesterday that OJ. Simpson's innocent because 
the evidence is just not  there. 
 
A: The evidence, it was enormous. 
 
Q:  What evidence was enormous? 
 
A: It was just-it was just too much.  It  was like-feel like somebody 
just framed him,  somebody just- 
 
Q:  Oh, you mean the evidence of his guilt  was enormous. 
 
A:  Right. Like all this evidences were out  there. It was just- 
 
Q:  So you mean the evidence of his guilt was  so enormous that in 
your mind it created a suspicion  that he was being framed. Is that 
what you're saying? 
 
A: Yes.   
 
Q:  I see.  And the enormous evidence of guilt would include such 
things as his blood found at the crime scene. Right? 
 
MR. BAKER: This is irrelevant- 
 
THE WITNESS: The evidence of guilt? 
 
MR. BAKER:-and you are doing this- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Excuse me? 
 
MR. BAKER:-totally for television shows,  Mr. Petrocelli, and you 
know it. 
 
MR. BREWER: Leave out- 
 
MR. KELLY: What show? 
 
MR. BAKER: Whatever he's going to appear on  next. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's uncalled for. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Do you have the question in mind? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  I am probing her bias, and she  thinks Mr. 
Simpson's innocent in the face of, as she has just indicated, 
"enormous" evidence of his guilt 
 
Q:  And I would like to know why you have  what appears to me- 
 
A:  You know what- 
 
Q:  -to be a totally irrational viewpoint. 
 
MR. BAKER: Oh, is that right?  Mr. Petrocelli, you are not the 
judge or the jury, although you'd like to be 13 people at the same 
time. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Let the lawyers have their barbed exchange- 
 
THE WITNESS: Okay 
 
MR. KRAMER:-and then I want to make sure you have the 
question in mind.  I want you to think about it, and then everybody 
in this room is entitled to your answer. 
 
THE WITNESS: Okay. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Well, let me ask you this question: 
What  evidence do you have that Mr. Simpson was framed? 
 
MR. BAKER:  She currently maintains. 
 
THE WITNESS:  The gloves, the socks; the-you  know, the three 
blood stains on the driveway, why was  it on Ashford side as 
opposed to Rockingham side. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Why was what on Ashford? 
 
A:  The bloodstain was on Ashford side, not on Rockingham side.  
Why were no blood stains on the carpet going to his bedroom if he 
came with bloody  socks, so... 
 
Q:  Okay.  Have you discussed these ideas  with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  At no time? 
 
A:  I talked to him about it, yeah.  I have doubts about-these are 
things that entered my mind. 
 
Q:  And have you ever discussed them with Mr. Simpson, these 
doubts that you have with the evidence? 
 
A:  We don't talk about those things, though. 
 
Q:  Not once have you ever spoken to him about this? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Not once? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Never asked him about the glove and how it got there 
and the socks and how it got  there- 
 
A:  (Shakes head.) 
 
Q:  -and never asked him about the blood? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered and harassing 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Never asked him, "Was that your 
blood at Bundy? Did you bleed there that night?" 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you ever ask him that? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Pap 487 
 
Q:  You're not really interested in finding out if he's responsible for 
these deaths.  Correct? 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: Not what? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: You are not really interested in 
knowing the truth, are you? 
 
MR. BAKER: What? 
 
THE WITNESS: Am I not interested? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Yes.  You're not really interested in 
finding out the truth. You just want to believe that  he's innocent.  
Correct? 
 
MR. KRAMER:  Stop, think about the question and  answer the 
question. 
 
MR. BAKER: Could you have it read back so that she can hear 
that question? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah. 
 
Q:  You are looking at me as though you don't  understand my 
questions. Are they unclear? 
 
A: Well, you asked me a lot of questions, so  you're trying to... 
 
Q: Let me tell you why I asked the question,  and I would like to 
get an answer. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: You tell me that the evidence of his guilt is "enormous." You 
tell me that it's so enormous that it leads you to suspect that he's 
being framed, and then you pointed out some of the examples of 
the evidence that you think was put there to frame him- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:-and yet you tell me you never once have asked him about any 
of this evidence? Is that your testimony? 
 
A: Yes, I have not asked him, yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. And I asked you, are you really  interested in knowing 
the truth about whether  Mr. Simpson killed your very best friend, 
Nicole? 
 
A:  I would like to know who really killed  Nicole. Of course I do. 
 
Q:  But you don't think it's OJ. Simpson. 
 
A:  Well, he was-to me there were a lot of-to me there was a lot of 
people that-I mean,  others who could have done it.  That's how I 
saw this whole thing. 
 
Q:  Could have? A: Yes. 
 
Q: And who are those others? 
 
A: I don't know, but Nicole at that time for   
 
the last six weeks led a very dangerous life. 
 
Q: Okay. And who are the other suspects? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Well, name them. You said there were others. Name them. Give 
me their names. 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't speculate. 
 
THE WITNESS: I can't name them. BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: 
Why not? 
 
A: They were doing drugs. They were doing cocaine. I mean, not 
drugs, but Faye was doing  cocaine. And they were going out a lot. 
They were bar-hopping, they were going to different clubs, so at  
that time I didn't know what they were doing. 
 
Q:  So you think one of-somebody that Nicole met during this time 
frame murdered her? 
 
A:  I don't know.  I mean-you know. 
 
Q:  But you never asked Mr. Simpson 
 
MR. BAKER:  Asked and answered eight times. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  -why his blood is found at the crime  
scene. 
 
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: I have not asked anything. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: You never asked him why Nicole's 
blood is found in his car. Never asked him that either? 
 
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: (Shakes head.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Excuse me? A: No, I didn't ask. 
 
Q: Did you ever a him why Ron Goldman's blood is found in OJ.'s 
car? Did you ever ask him  that question? 
 
A:  Was it? I don't know. 
 
Q:  You didn't know that? 
 
A:  No.  I never followed the case, so I'm  sorry. 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't apologize to him. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Do you-did Mr. Simpson or anyone 
else  ever give you any information to the effect that this  glove 
was planted, this bloody glove? Anyone ever tell you anything 
about that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or that the sock was planted? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you have any information at all  that any of these items of 
evidence were planted or   manufactured? 
 
A:  Any evidence? 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
MR. KRAMER: You're talking about other than what she might- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Other than her own speculation and surmise. 
 
THE WITNESS: This is my own speculation. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  No one ever told you- 
 
A:  -that somebody confirmed it? No. 
 
Q: Or given you any information on it. 
 
A:  No, no one. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Now, after Nicole's death did you  have any 
conversations with Kato Kaelin? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what was the purpose of those  conversations? 
 
A: At that time we were trying to commiserate, so at the time I 
didn't have a friend  and-that I could trust, and I thought that we 
could  trust each other, and just trying to figure out what  really 
happened. That's all. 
 
Q:  Did you tell Kato Kaelin that you believed that OJ. killed 
Nicole?   
 
A:  I didn't say that. 
 
Q:  You deny saying that? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Excuse me? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  So if Mr. Kaelin testified that you said that, he would not be 
telling the truth? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you meet with Mr. Kaelin's  attorney, Michael 
Plotkin? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what was the reason for that? 
 
A: At the time Kato said if I needed a lawyer, that he would help 
me, and that's pretty much why I met Michael Plotkin. Oh, no. It's 
because of the National Enquirer.  That's true, yeah. 
 
Q:  Did you ask him for some legal advice? 
 
A:  Exactly, right. 
 
Q:  But you never hired him. Right? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Okay.  You told Kato Kaelin that  Marcus-that Nicole was 
seeing Marcus Allen again in 1994. Correct?   
 
A: 1994? 
 
Q: (Nods head.) 
 
MR. BAKER: He is asking if you told Kaelin that. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  You told that to Kato. 
 
A:  I must have, yeah. 
 
Q:  And during these conversations with Kato Kaelin, you also told 
him that Nicole had ended her  relationship with Mr. Simpson 
sometime in May of 1994, having reached that decision while in 
Cabo San Lucas. Correct? 
 
A: What Nicole-yeah, I told him Nicole  was thinking about, yeah. 
 
Q: That's what you told Kato Kaelin. Correct? 
 
MR. KRAMER: Do you understand the distinction?  He is now 
asking- he is asking you to  confirm- 
 
THE WITNESS: Kato's? 
 
MR. KRAMER:-whether or not you made these statements to 
Kato. 
 
THE WITNESS: I must have.  I don't know.  See, these were-you 
know, we were just conversing, so I  don't know. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Well, that's what I'm asking. 
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q:  You made that statement to Kato Kaelin. Correct? 
 
A: Must have, yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Why do you say you "must have"? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Please don't.  You can ask her questions 
when it's your turn.  Okay? 
 
MR. KRAMER:  I really don't want to.  That's fine. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Okay.  Thank you. 
 
Q:  You told Kato Kaelin that Nicole and Ron Goldman had seen 
each other a couple times.  Correct? 
 
A:  I'm sorry.  Could you repeat that, please? 
 
Q:  You told Kato Kaelin that Nicole and Ron Goldman had seen 
each other several times. Correct? 
 
A:  Several times? 
 
Q:  Some times.  Words to that effect. Is that right? 
 
A: What do you mean, "Sometimes?" How many times?  I don't 
 
Q:  Did you tell that to Kato Kaelin?  
 
A:  I don't remember. 
 
Q:  Well, can you please think? 
 
MR. BAKER: That's argumentative. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Did you tell Kato Kaelin that Nicole 
and Ron had seen each other? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And that Ron Goldman had driven Nicole's car? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  And that the two were not dating? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. And you told Kato Kaelin that Nicole had-that you had 
learned that Nicole had  planned to have Goldman come over that 
evening that  she was murdered. 
 
A:  Did I tell- 
 
Q:  You told Kato Kaelin that yon had learned that Nicole was 
planning to have Goldman come over  that evening. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  You told Kato Kaelin that Nicole returned  an expensive 
bracelet to OJ. Simpson. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And you told Kato Kaelin that Nicole told   
 
OJ. that he could not buy her with the bracelet. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  You told Kato Kaelin that OJ. Simpson planned the IRS letter 
to get Nicole into trouble financially and to cause her to have no 
money. 
 
A:  I must have, yes, right. 
 
Q:  And you learned that from Nicole. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  You had run into Kato Kaelin once or twice at a market in 
Brentwood and while jogging.  Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  And you also talked one day at a coffee  shop in Beverly Hills 
called Michel Richard? 
 
A:  Michel Richard? Yes.  Yes. 
 
Q:  You told-Withdrawn. At the wake did you pound on  Mr. 
Simpson's chest at all? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  And did you say, "Why, why, why, why did  you do it?" 
 
A: No, because that's wrong. 
 
Q:  You say it's "wrong."  Right? 
 
A: Well-   
 
MR. BAKER: What? 
 
THE WITNESS:-see, they put words in my mouth. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Who is "they"? 
 
A: This one, the media, they already -that thing has been-I-what I 
said- 
 
MR. BAKER: You're cutting her off very badly this time. 
 
 BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: You may finish. 
 
A: Okay.  What I said, and I would like to  really-I was crying, 
okay. I went to him. He was  sitting with his mother. I was crying, 
pounding,  pounding his chest, and I was crying. I said, "What  
happened? What happened here? Who did this to my  friend? And 
all that she wanted to do was take care  of Sydney and Justin." 
 
And OJ. said, "I just loved her so  much. I just loved her so much," 
and then that was it. That was the end of the conversation. 
 
Q:  "Loved her too much." Right? 
 
A: No; I said, "I loved her so much. I  loved her so much." 
 
 MR. BAKER:  Nice try.   
 
THE WITNESS: See, you asked me also about that yesterday, the 
" too much. n So as I said, you know, if "too" and "so" mean the 
same, so-so be it, but I said, "I loved her so much. I loved her so 
much." 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Did Nicole ever tell you that- Excuse 
me. 
 
Did OJ. Simpson ever tell you that he was thinking about 
surprising Nicole for her birthday  in May of 1994 by renting a 
yacht and taking Nicole  and her friends out on the yacht? 
 
A: If OJ. told me? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Did Nicole tell you that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  And did Nicole tell you that she did not  want to go to Florida 
on a yacht with Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: No. She said that-she was actually  thinking about that. She 
wanted to, but she wasn't  sure-at the time 
 
she wasn't sure if she really  wanted to do it or not; that's all. 
 
Q: So Nicole told you that she was not sure. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.   
 
A: It was in a planning stage, pretty much. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I think that's all I have for now, but I reserve 
my right to ask any further questions when the other counsel have 
concluded their questioning. 
 
MR. BAKER: Are you going to have any questions, Mike? 
 
MR. BREWER: Yeah. 
 
MR. BAKER: How long? 
 
MR. BREWER: Half hour. 
 
 MR. BAKER: All right. Do you want to go, and  then I'll go after 
you? 
 
 MR. BREWER: Mr. Kelly asked to go second this  time. 
 
 MR. BAKER: Okay, I'll go next.  Let's take a quick break. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
 THEVIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record  now, and 
the time is approximately 2:30. 
 
(Recess.) 
 
 THEVIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record  now, and the 
time is approximately 2:40. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Couple more questions. 
 
Q:  Did Nicole ever tell you about keeping a diary?   
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Okay. Do you know whether she was making any notes of her 
conversations with OJ. Simpson around the time that she died? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Okay. Did she tell you about a  conversation that she had with 
Mr. Simpson on June 3 or June 2 when they had a vicious 
argument, and he-and she hung up on him? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Do you recognize the hand- writing  in this document 
which has been previously marked as  en exhibit in this case? It's 
Exhibit 86. 
 
Do you recognize that as Nicole's  handwriting? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Do you see that? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q:  And that's Nicole's handwriting? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  And I am showing you the last two pages  of Exhibit 86, 
including and in particular the entry  on June 3. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Does that ring a bell?   A: Yes.  Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. This is where Nicole is describing that OJ. had come 
over to pick up the kids, came too late, and they slept over at the 
house, and then she's writing down the things that OJ. had said to 
her at that time. Do you see that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, did she tell you about that  conversation? 
 
A: Yes, she told me about that conversation. 
 
Q: Okay. And- 
 
A: She didn't tell me the whole thing, but  she told me that she- 
 
Q:  The gist of it. 
 
A: Yeah, right. 
 
Q: Okay. Not each and every word that she wrote down here- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:-but she told you the gist of that  conversation that- 
 
A: That she spoke to OJ., yes. 
 
Q: The one conversation I'm referring to is  the one, for the record, 
indicated on June 3-under  her notes for June 3 in the Exhibit 86.   
Do you see that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. And did you speak to OJ. Simpson about that 
conversation? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And do you know why OJ. Simpson was so hostile towards 
Nicole? 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: At that time? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Yes. 
 
A:  I thought it was because of the IRS  letter. 
 
Q:  Why was OJ. Simpson doing this to  Nicole? 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  What did Nicole tell you?  In other  
words, what- 
 
A:  They were fighting over-about their  friends, you know. Nicole 
was upset that Faye was  invited to the sports spectacular, and I 
remember  Nicole calling me and said, you know, "I can't believe  
OJ.'s buying my friends," and that's pretty much why they were 
both fighting. 
 
Q:  Do you know why OJ. Simpson started to threaten Nicole with 
IRS action? 
 
A:  I don't know. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you why he was doing this? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  He had never done this before to your knowledge. Correct? 
 
A:  What, the IRS? 
 
Q:  Threatened her with IRS action. 
 
A:  That was the first time, yes. 
 
Q:  And do you have any information, based on  all of your 
conversations with Nicole, why he was  doing this? 
 
A: Because... 
 
 MR. BAKER: This would be speculation also. 
 
THE WITNESS: See, I-see, what I think doesn't-you know, it's not 
what OJ. or Nicole said, I mean, but at that time I thought they 
were fighting over Faye. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:  Why would-what does that have to do  
with OJ. threatening IRS action? 
 
A: Because Nicole called OJ., screaming at  him, saying, you 
know, "Why are you taking all my   friends away from me? You 
think you can take my friends again." 
 
And OJ. said, you know, "I wasn't- "I wasn't"-OJ. was denying 
that. He says, you know, "It was Faye who called me, who wanted 
to be invited to the sports spectacular," and then- and that's pretty 
much the conversation. 
 
Q:  So you don't know why OJ. was threatening IRS action.  
Correct? 
 
A:  No, I don't. 
 
Q:  Now, in these notes Nicole Simpson is  writing about her 
children, and 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  -do you have any understanding as to  why she was making 
notes about her children during this time, meaning near the very 
end of her life? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q:  Did she- 
 
A: I didn't even know she was writing a  diary. 
 
Q:  Did she express any concern to you about  her children in the 
last few weeks of her life? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  About who would care for her children- 
 
A: No.   
 
Q:-if something should happen to her? 
 
A: Well, we talked about that during our run. You know, we kid 
around. I said, "If anything should happen to us, you know, we'll 
take care of each other's kids." 
 
Q:  Oh, that was-you were kidding around, you mean? 
 
A:  Well, you know, when we go and we have fights with our 
husband and we said, "Oh, you know, if  anything should happen 
to us, you know, and so... 
 
Q:  You took that seriously. Correct? 
 
A:  I didn't take it serious, but we talked  about it all the time. 
 
Q:  Well, you told me yesterday that that's  the pact of Nicole that 
you're now honoring. 
 
A: I am, yeah, it's a pact that we honored. We talked about it all the 
time, yes. 
 
Q:  So it's something you took seriously  enough to honor now that 
she has been killed. 
 
A: Yes.  Yes. 
 
Q: So it wasn't a big joke. 
 
A:  No, it wasn't a big joke. 
 
Q:  Okay. Getting back to my question, do  you know why she was 
concerned about her children near  the very end?   
 
A: She was always concerned about her kids. 
 
Q:  Why she was concerned about her children when it came to OJ. 
Simpson? 
 
A: I don't think she was concerned with- 
 
Q: Do you know why she was making notes about OJ. Simpson's 
activities concerning the children? 
 
A: I didn't know that. I didn't know that she was making notes. 
 
Q:  Was she complaining to you near the end that OJ. wasn't 
available for the children? 
 
A:  No, she was not complaining. 
 
Q:  That he wasn't picking them up on time or showing up for them 
or was away quite-too much? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  No? 
 
A:  Well, you know, OJ. was always away, you know, back and 
forth, so I don't know. I don't  remember. 
 
Q:  On May 22 she says, "we officially split  up," and then later on 
at the end of that entry she  says, "He's been gone the last 4 
weekends." Do you recall her telling you that? 
 
A:  All I know is at the time when she talked  to me about their 
split-up, I know she said to me, 
 
"We're gonna start talking about every other weekend." You know, 
"When kids"  "when he's around, he should be with the kids. I don't 
want him to get away with this, he can just take time off and not be 
with the  kids." Yeah, I remember that. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And on May 28 she says that OJ. went away for 
Saturday and Sunday but took the kids Friday and Monday. This is 
Memorial Day weekend. Do you recall that? 
 
A:  I don't remember. 
 
Q:  Excuse me? 
 
A:  I don't remember that. 
 
Q:  She says, "Blowup with  Cora in  car." Do you see that? "Blow 
up with  Cora in  car." 
 
A: "Blow up with  Cora in car." 
 
Q:  Right above the entry for May 28, 1994. What's that about? 
 
A:  "Blow up with  Cora in car." Oh, I  remember that. We were- 
when I was gonna pick up  the kids -I went to pick up the kids in 
the morning,  because I asked Nicole- I think that was when Nicole  
had pneumonia or something like that. I don't  remember. But I 
went to pick up their kids to go to  school, to [Name Deleted], and 
so Nicole called me in my   
 
car and said that OJ. wants to take the kids to school. 
 
"But"-I said, "But that's okay. I already have them in the car.." 
 
And so as I was going through Bundy by the corner of Gretna 
Green, OJ. was behind me, and he toot the horn and he said, "Let 
me take the kids to  school." 
 
And so I said, "Well, I have the kids  with me." 
 
He says, "No. I'll take the kids to  school." 
 
 I said, "Okay, fine." So the kids got out and they went with  their 
dad. 
 
Q: How- 
 
A: And I was on the phone with Nicole. I said, you know, "Why is 
he taking the kids to school?" You know, 
 
"I have them." 
 
So that's when she said, you know, "He's  mad. He's mad. We got 
into a fight." 
 
Q:  So that must be the fight.  So that's the  blowup with Cora. 
 
Q:  Let me see if I understand this. You had  Nicole's children in 
the car? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Sydney and Justin? A:  Yes.  That was in the morning. 
 
Q:  You had picked them up where? 
 
A:  From Bundy to take them to [Name Deleted] to school. 
 
Q:  So you are driving en route from Bundy to [Name Deleted]. 
Right., 
 
A: From Gretna Green to San Vicente, yeah. 
 
Q:  How long is that ride to the school? 
 
A: How long is the ride? I would say three  minutes. 
 
Q: And then while you're driving away from  Nicole's house, then 
you get a call from Nicole on  your car phone? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And she tells you that OJ. wants to take the kids to school? 
 
A: No. "OJ. called me and looking for the  kids, and he wants to 
take the kids to school." 
 
Q:  Okay. 
 
A: And then while I was crossing the  intersection, I said, "Oh, 
OJ.'s here. He's in  front"- "he's behind me now." 
 
Q:  And he beeped the horn at you? 
 
A:  Beeped the horn. 
 
Q:  What car did he have? 
 
A:  He had the Bentley, and then pull on the side and he said, you 
know, all I want to take the kids." 
 
I said, "Well, you know, take the kids." 
 
Q:  At that time I said, "What's going on here? Is he mad or what?" 
 
She says, "Let him take them.  So he took the kids to school. 
 
Q: Which kids? A: Sydney and Justin. 
 
Q:  And did he take your kids? 
 
A: Took- 
 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: And then I took my kids to [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q:  So you and he both then drove to the school together- 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q:-in the same-He didn't take your children. A: No, he didn't take 
my kids. 
 
Q:  Okay. And did he seem upset to you? A: Yes.  Yes. 
 
Q: Did he say anything to you? 
 
A: No. He just say, "I want my kids." 
 
Q:  Now- A: He was mad. He was angry- 
 
Q:  Yes, he was mad and angry. 
 
A:-because we were just having, you know... 
 
Q:  Where did the exchange of the kids occur? 
 
A: On Gretna Green-I mean, San Vicente and Gretna Green. 
 
Q:  And how long did it take from that point  to get to the school? 
 
A: Oh, my God. It's about two miles, So  one, two-two and a half 
miles, so I would say,  what, two minutes? 
 
Q:  Did you-later on when you dropped the children off, did you 
call Nicole and say, "What's  going on here? What happened? 
What's this all about?" 
 
A:  Well, yeah, we spoke on the phone.  I  said, "What's going on?" 
 
Q:  And what did she tell you? 
 
A:  She said that OJ.'s mad at me.  I said, "Why?"  At that time I 
think OJ. thought that I  was the bad influence to Nicole's life 
because of my  affair with [Name Deleted].   
 
Q:  That's what Nicole told you? 
 
A:  Well, Nicole told me, "OJ.'s mad at you. 
 
Q:  Oh, "OJ.'s mad at you." A:  Me. 
 
Q:  Oh, so he didn't want you taking his kids to school. 
 
A:  Yeah, because he thought I was a bad influence to Nicole's life, 
whatever Nicole was going  through. 
 
Q:  I see.  And did you talk to OJ. Simpson  about that at all? 
 
A:  Later on, yeah. 
 
Q:  When? 
 
A:  I must have told him when-you know what?  We really didn't 
talk about that. 
 
Q:  You said, "Later on, yeah." When? 
 
A: I don't remember. I mean, I think So,  yeah. 
 
Q:  Before he was arrested? Before Nicole's  death or after? 
 
A: Oh, after, after Nicole's death. 
 
Q: When he got out of jail, or on the phone  while he was in jail? 
 
A: I think over the phone when he was in-   when the book came 
out, when Faye Resnick-yeah, right, when Faye Resnick's book 
came out. 
 
Q:  And what did he tell you about his being mad at you? 
 
A:  Because he thought I was the bad -you know, I was the bad 
influence. "Negative vibes bring negative vibes," is what he said. 
 
Q:  And what did you tell him? That it wasn't you, that it was 
Faye? 
 
A: I said, you know, "Faye and Nicole were going out a lot. It 
wasn't me." 
 
Q:  What was the reaction of the children to  being taken out of 
your car and being put in OJ.'s  car? 
 
A: What was their reaction? It was nothing. 
 
Q: Nothing? 
 
A: Yeah, they were just-they left my car  and they drove into their 
daddy's car. 
 
Q:  Did your children go-did you or your children go with Nicole's 
children to see THE  FLINTSTONES movie during the Memorial 
Day weekend?

children? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: You don't remember? 
 
A: About the children? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: No. That's pretty much the weekend. They were-you know, she 
wanted the weekend schedule. That's pretty much it. 
 
Q:  Nicole writes here, "I told OJ. we're  going back to every other 
weekend." 
 
A:  Yeah, that's right. 
 
Q:  I need the rest and OJ.'s gone so much-he needs the alone time 
with them." Is that what Nicole told you? 
 
A:  Yeah, she mentioned to me, yes, that  she's gonna work on the 
week- ends with him.

BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  Isn't it true that you told Mr.  Vannatter on September 14th that 
Nicole had told you-if you go to paragraph 4. On paragraph 4 you 
say- the statement form says you say: 
 
"She stated that Nicole told her that OJ. had stated to Nicole, ' I

part?

Nicole told you this in 1993? 
 
 MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading question.

with Marcus Allen. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  And that was in 1993. True? 
 
A: Right. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. You will have to permit 
me to object because every one of his questions will be an attempt 
to lead you to say what he wants you to say, and I will have to 
object to it. 
 
THE WITNESS: Sorry. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  And you were a little bit confused right  now because you told

A: True.

Q:  And that's not included in the statement form attached as 
Exhibit 158, is it? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Objection.  Leading.  Document speaks for 
itself. 
 
MR. BREWER: What statement? Also vague and ambiguous. 
 
THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry.  There are too many-I don't understand

MR. PETROCELLI: Move to strike as non-responsive. 
 
BY MR. BAKER:

my friend," you know. 
 
Q:  Nicole said she didn't trust Faye?

BY MR. BAKER:

didn't have  any money; Paul would not accept her anymore, and 
she  was panicking.

because she was taking I think-I don't know,  Percocet or whatever 
the pain killer was, she was  taking too much of that. 
 
Q:  Percodan? 
 
A: I don't know, but it's a pain killer.

Q: (Nods head.) 
 
 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Were you invited to this intervention? 
 
A: No.  _ 
 
Q: Did anybody ever tell you about this intervention? 
 
A: No. You have to understand, Nicole knows I don't like Faye, 
and she knew about that, so... 
 
Q: Did Nicole think that Faye could be bought? 
 
A: Uh-huh. MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: She actually said that, "I'm  afraid that Faye can 
be bought."

week when Faye-or couple weeks, whatever, when Faye was living 
at Gretna Green-or at Bundy, rather? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Lack of foundation. Misstates her 
testimony. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q: Did she talk about Faye during those jogging trips? 
 
A: I would say yes. 
 
Q: What would she say? A:  That she's worried about Faye and that 
she's taking too much Perco-whatever, pain  killer. I'm not sure 
what it is. 
 
Q:  Were you worried about the people Nicole  was hanging out 
with in the spring of 1994? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading, vague,  ambiguous, lack 
of foundation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I wasn't worried, no. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  Were you concerned for her? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Same objections. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes, I was concerned. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  Why were you concerned? 
 
A: At that time Nicole was leading like a 
 
 
 
dangerous life. I mean, she was coming on to guys; she was, you 
know, doing these things with Faye, and I  was worried about her. 
 
Q: When you talked to Michael Viner, you said on  
 
"And that-that's Nicole, Nicole wasn't really into those things. And 
I think because with the drugs and this thing and alcohol, I don't 
know what happened to Nicole  . . . And If eel that led  her to her 
death."  Do you remember saying that? 
 
A:  Could you repeat that again, please? 
 
Q: Sure.  I'm sorry.  Pagel6 of your statement with Michael Viner- 
 
 Did we attach this? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I did not attach it. 
 
MR. BAKER: Okay, why don't we attach it as the  next one in line. 
 
 MR. KRAMER: The entire exhibit? 
 
MR. BAKER: Sure. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Let me just ask whether there  is-I have not seen 
this before. It has "Confidential" stamped on it. I don't know 
whether 
 
 this transcript is sealed confidential and whether this is- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: This is not a sealed confidential transcript. 
 
MR. KRAMER: So this will become part of the public domain, 
this confidential report? 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, it's- 
 
THE WITNESS: I signed it-Michael Viner signed that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's just a standard D.A. 
 
MR. BAKER: Every document has it produced by  the D.A. from 
what I have seen. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Well, if there is- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I have no objection to it  being included, and 
I think it probably should. 
 
MR. KRAMER: And I-my preference is for it  not to be there 
because this was an interview that my client gave with the cloak of 
confidentiality at the time. 
 
MR. BAKER:  Okay.  Well, I have no- I won't  mark it if it 
concerns you, and I will just continue  to refer to it. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Please, that's our preference. 
 
 MR. BREWER: Well, it should be marked. It's  been referred to, 
it's been identified, and irrespective of counsel's concerns, every 
single document from the D A. has that stamp, and it's a public 
record, and we ought to mark it as an exhibit. If you want to not 
attach it to the deposition transcript, that's fine. 
 
MR. BAKER: Okay. 
 
MR. KRAMER: I appreciate that as a matter of courtesy. If you are 
willing to do that, that's great. We will just do that. 
 
MR. BAKER:  What's the next- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, I would- 
 
MR. BAKER: What's the next exhibit number? 
 
 THEREPORTER: 164. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  I don't know why it shouldn't  be included as 
an exhibit. I think it should be included. 
 
 MR. KELLY: Attach it. 
 
 MR. PETROCELLI: Exhibit 164. You've been  overruled. 
 
MR. BREWER: You've been overruled.  Attach it. 
 
MR. KELLY: I am going to if you don't. 
 
MR. KRAMER: I will lodge my objection based on  Article I, 
Section 1, of the California Constitution  for privacy rights, and 
before this is-the  transcript is completely done, I have procedures 
that 
 
 
 
I can do, and I don't know whether I'll do them. 
 
MR. KELLY: This is the Viner manuscript where she gave an 
interview for commercial purposes? 
 
MR. KRAMER: This is an interview that she gave with certain 
confidentiality restrictions placed to it. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah. 
 
MR. KRAMER: So that's right. So I am lodging that objection, and 
I will confer with my client at some point between now and then. 
 
MR. BAKER:  Until then we will mark it as Exhibit 164. It will 
not be attached to the record  pending discussions at the close of 
this deposition. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's not agreed to. 
 
(Defendant's Exhibit 164 was marked for identification by the 
reporter  and is attached hereto.) 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q: Nonetheless, on page 16-or actually- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Do you have copies of it? 
 
MR. KELLY: Uh-uh. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You want some? 
 
MR. KELLY: Sure. I'll need them eventually. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q: On page 16, line 10, you say: 
 
 
 
 "And that-that's Nicole. Nicole wasn't really into those things. And 
I think because with the drugs and this thing and alcohol, I don't 
know what happened to Nicole . . .  And I feel that led"-that that 
led her to her  death."  Do you remember saying that? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  What did you mean by that? 
 
A:  What do I mean by that?  She was doing-she was drinking too 
much and her association with Faye.  That's pretty much. 
 
Q:  And you were concerned for her safety.  True? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Objection.  Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  And that's why you went to talk to OJ. about going to Florida. 
Isn't that true? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: True. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q: And when you took that walk around the 
 
 
 
block with OJ. over at Rockingham, you said that you thought it 
was best that OJ. take Nicole and the kids, and move to Florida.  
True? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: True. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q: And that was because you were concerned about her safety, and 
you thought that OJ. could protect her. True? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: True. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  And at that time OJ. told you that he was currently dating 
Paula. True? 
 
 MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: True. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q: And you thought OJ. was the best person  to protect her at that 
time, didn't you?     . 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS:  At that time, yes, because they  wanted to-you 
know, I thought that they could get back together again. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  In 1992 was Nicole receiving threatening 
 
 
 
phone calls? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  This was in the calendar year of 1992? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you about those phone calls? 
 
A:  Yes.  Every day someone was calling, calling her up like three, 
four times a day, and pretty much an obscene phone call. 
 
Q: And this is when she moved into Gretna  Green? 
 
A: Yes 
 
Q: Did she ever tell you that she was  fearful because of these 
phone calls?  MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q: Did she ever file a police report? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When did she file the police report, if you know? 
 
A: During the time when she was worried  about her safety. I don't 
know the time frame. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you that Detective Fuhrman and Phillips were the 
investigating officers during  those phone calls? 
 
 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know.  BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  The police found a suspect, didn't they? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  And they identified one person who they believed were making 
the phone calls. True? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: True. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  And that was not OJ. Simpson. True? 
 
 MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: True. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  And in fact Nicole asked OJ. to keep an eye on her because of 
these phone calls.  True? 
 
 MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: True. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  She was concerned about her safety, and she was concerned 
about the safety of her children.  True? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS:  True. Actually, Nicole spoke to that guy. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  Nicole spoke to the caller? 
 
A:  The caller. 
 
Q:  When did she speak to the caller? 
 
A:  That-when the guy was investigated.  I mean when they found 
the guy. 
 
Q:  What did she say to him? 
 
A:  She said, "You have to stop calling me." 
 
Q:  Did she call him up? 
 
A:  No. I think the guy called again. 
 
Q:  The guy called after the police had  already arrested him.' 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And what did she say? 
 
A:  No, not arrested. The guy called during the time. She says, you 
know "You can't call here. I know you, I know where you live, and 
I know who you  are." 
 
Q:  Is that before she lodged the police  report? 
 
A:  Before what? 
 
Q:  Before she lodged a police report, if you  know? 
 
 
 
A:  No. That was already when it was -when she reported to the 
police. 
 
Q:  And as far as you know, the calls ceased after that? 
 
A:  As far as I know, yes. 
 
Q:  In 1993 before the reconciliation Nicole wanted to get back 
with OJ. Isn't that true? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  And OJ. was dating Paula at that point.  True? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: True. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  And Paula-or Nicole told you that she  would go anywhere 
with OJ.  True? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  Nicole told you that she would go  anywhere with OJ. in 1993. 
True? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: True.  BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  And she actually put that in a letter to 
 
 
 
OJ.  True? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: True. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  I want to get the dating chronology accurately.  When she 
moved out of Rockingham, she was dating Alessandro. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Who broke up with whom.; How did that  relationship end, Nicole 
and Alessandro? 
 
A: It was pretty much [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q:  And then subsequently she started dating  Keith Zlomsowitzh? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  And how did that relationship end? 
 
A: How did that end? She basically stopped seeing-well, they still 
saw each other, but stopped having sex when Nicole got back from 
Cabo and she started seeing [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q:  When is this? 1992? 1993? 
 
A: 1992. May of '92, must be around that  time. 
 
Q:  Do you know how they broke up? Did she 
 
 
 
tell him' A: Who? 
 
Q:  Did Nicole tell Keith the relationship was over? 
 
A: Why they broke up? 
 
Q:  No. How-when did it break up, or how did it break up? 
 
A: How? Because Nicole found [Name Deleted].  Really, Nicole 
was not really attracted to Keith. As  Nicole said, "I just used Keith 
for sex," because she was very-she was very lonely at that time, 
and  she-and Keith was there. 
 
Q:  How long did she go out with Keith? 
 
A:  I would say two months. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you when she told Keith the  relationship was 
over? 
 
A:  She didn't tell me, but pretty much when she got back from 
Cabo, Keith was heartbroken because she told him about [Name 
Deleted], that she had-she  slept with [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q:  She slept with [Name Deleted] in Cabo? 
 
A: In Cabo. 
 
Q:  Was Keith upset when she told- 
 
A: Keith was very upset. Keith was in love  with her, with Nicole. 
 
 
 
Q:  And they broke up in May of 1992? 
 
A:  Around that, yes. 
 
Q:  Did they ever see each other after that? 
 
A:  They remained friends, yes. 
 
Q:  Anything more than friends after May of 1992, as far as you 
know? 
 
A:  I don't know. 
 
Q:  How long did she date [Name Deleted]? 
 
A:  Not that long, because [Name Deleted] was living with another 
woman before. 
 
Q:  Was he married? 
 
A:  What? 
 
Q:  Was [Name Deleted] married? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  He was living with another woman when  Nicole and he were 
dating? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  How long did she go out with [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: How long?  Not that long. 
 
Q:  And who broke up with whom? 
 
A: At that time it was Nicole. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you how she broke up with  him? 
 
A:  Because she said that "I will not go out 
 
 with a man with another"-you know, "with another woman." 
 
Q:  Did she tell you when that was? A:  I would say around July. 
 
Q:   July of 1993 or 1992? 
 
A:  1994-no, no, can't be. I think they went out for about six 
months. 
 
Q:  And then subsequently she started dating [Name Deleted]? 
 
A:  Okay.  Wait.  Now I'm getting confused with tine here.  When 
did they get their divorce?  October? 
 
Q:  October of i992. 
 
A:  1992. So May, June, July, August. Yeah,  it was August, 
September. Okay. Till September the  relationship with [Name 
Deleted] fell apart, and then from October she started going out 
with [Name Delete]. 
 
Q:  Was [Name Deleted] married at this point? 
 
A:  At this point? 
 
Q:  (Nods head.) 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Was he ever married when he was dating  Nicole? 
 
A: No, I don't know, so... 
 
Q:  How long did she go out with [Name Deleted]? 
 
A:  I would say three months.  October, November, December, 
yeah. 
 
Q: Then she started going out with [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: '93, yeah. She met [Name Deleted]in Aspen. 
 
Q: And how long did she go out? 
 
A: How long? 
 
Q: With [Name Deleted]. 
 
A: I would say they actually went out only  twice. 
 
Q:  Subsequently, she started going back out  with OJ.  True? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
 THE WITNESS: Yes, right. That's January, right. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  And then in 1994 she had sex with a person by the name of 
[Name Deleted], and she was  seeing Marcus Allen as well. True? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: And yesterday Mr. Petrocelli was  referring to parties at OJ.'s, 
OJ.'s house. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
 
 
Q: When he was asking you about parties, it seemed like the 
terminology was somewhat confusing. 
 
Q:  When you've been over there and- there has been a group of 
people over there. True? 
 
A: True 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Object to your predicate as- 
 
THE WITNESS: True. 
 
MR.  PETROCELLI:-"parties" being confusing, lacks foundation, 
leading. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  Have you been to any formal parties with  OJ. since his 
acquittal in October? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And so when you've gone over to his house  to pick up your 
children, there have been family  members and various friends, but 
nothing you would  describe as a party. True? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: True. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q: About this interview you had with Michael  Viner and 
representatives of the National Enquirer,  the National Enquirer 
representatives would have paid  you money for your story. True? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: But you decided against that.  True? 
 
A: True. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q: Why? 
 
A: Because I told Michael Viner, "I really don't want the tabloid. If 
we could avoid National Enquirer, I would like to do really 
another-you  know, through a magazine, a decent magazine." And 
Michael Viner knew that, and he told  me he's going to try Vanity 
Fair or, you know, like  People Magazine, a much better, you 
know, tasteful  magazine than National Enquirer. 
 
Q:  Do you know if he ever did that? 
 
A:  If they ever did that? No. 
 
Q:  If he ever did that, if he ever offered the story to People or 
Vanity Fair. 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Now, yesterday earlier in the day  Mr. Petrocelli asked you if 
Nicole had ever said that  different people would kill her, and you 
said yes. 
 
 MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q: Do you recall that? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Misstates her testimony. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: She said the only person who ever said he 
would kill her was OJ. Simpson. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  Did Nicole ever tell you that her mother would kill her? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading question. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  Did she ever tell you that Faye Resnick  might kill her? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading question. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q: Anybody else? 
 
A: That's pretty much-she used "kill" as  a figure of speech. That's 
why, you know, she kinda used that as-you know, it's like an 
expression. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Move to strike as non-responsive. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  And when Nicole told you that OJ. might  kill her if she-if he 
sees her with another men,  that occurred in 1993.  True? 
 
 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: True. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q: And were there any other times since the 1993 comment that 
she said that OJ. might kill her? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q: How many times? 
 
A:  Oh, you mean like she says, "OJ.'s gonna kill men? Yeah, she's 
mentioned that, you know, like  if she did something wrong or she 
went out, she says,  "Oh, God, OJ.'s gonna kill me if he finds out." 
 
Q: She used it as a figure of speech.  True? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS:  I thought so, yeah. (Discussion held off the 
record.) 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q: You've read what is attached as Exhibit 157.  True? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: And that refers to an interview you had  with Detective Payne 
on June 24th, 1994.  True? 
 
A: True, yes. 
 
Q: And you were completely honest and 
 
 accurate when you were answering his questions on that date. 
True?  
 
A:  True. 
 
Q: Have any other tabloids, other than the National Enquirer by 
way of Mr. Viner or the Star, offered you money for your story? 
 
A: All these people have offered money. 
 
Q: A lot of tabloids have offered you money? 
 
A: Yeah. Star has offered me at that time  100,000 if they give me-
my story, and I refused. 
 
Q:  Is this in June of 1994? 
 
A:  Around that time, yes.  And all the tabloids, you know, 
"American Journal," and all those people. 
 
Q:  How much has the "American Journal"  offered you? 
 
A:  Oh, they offered me money to talk. 
 
Q:  Why didn't you? 
 
A:  At that time I didn't want to talk  about-I thought I was 
betraying my friendship with  Nicole. 
 
Q:  Now, Mr. Petrocelli showed you some pictures of keys 
attached as exhibits 162 and 163. 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
MR. KRAMER: The exhibits to the deposition are 
 
 in front of the witness. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  Are you a hundred percent positive those are the keys on 
Exhibit 163 that Nicole maintained? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading- 
 
MR. KELLY: Objection as to form. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:-argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. A hundred percent, no. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: She indicated... 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q: The key that she used to use when she  went jogging had one or 
two keys on one single key  ring.  True? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection.  Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: One single key ring, yes. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  Now, there has been some reference in  some interviews that 
Nicole told you that OJ. was  following her. How many times did 
Nicole tell you that  OJ. was following her? 
 
A: How many times? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Misstates her  testimony. She said 
Nicole -she said OJ. was  following, not just Nicole said. She 
observed it 
 
 also. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  Well, you mentioned three incidents: You've mentioned two 
incidents in 1992 end an incident in 1994. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  In 1992 the sum total of the incident was that Nicole was 
sitting at a table; OJ. walked by, made one comment to her and 
turned around and walked  to the bar. True? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
MR. BREWER: And the men scattered. Go ahead. 
 
MR. KELLY: A number of them. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You forgot all the men running  for their 
lives. 
 
MR. BAKER: Did you get that answer? 
 
THE WITNESS: True. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. It's argumentative  and it's leading. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  And the other incident in 1992 where he was purportedly 
following her is when he walked into  Tryst and you believe saw 
her, turned around and left. True? 
 
 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: True.  MR. PETROCELLI: She said nothing 
about purported. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  And in 1994 the only incident you know of is that Nicole told 
you that she might have seen OJ.'s car behind her.  True? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading- 
 
 MR. KELLY: Might have? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:-misstates her 
 
testimony. 
 
THE WITNESS: True. 
 
 MR. BAKER: Why don't we take a five-minute break, and I'll 
wrap it up. 
 
 MR. PETROCELLI: Okay, thanks.

Q:  Miss Fischman, do you know about a car  accident that Faye 
Resnick and Nicole were involved in 
 
 in January of 1994? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  What do you know about that? 
 
A: They were on Sunset Boulevard, and they-Nicole was trying to 
light something and give it to Faye, and apparently Nicole said that 
she didn't  see the car, and so there was a car accident.  There was 
a-she hit the BMW that was in front of the car. 
 
Q:  Do you know- 
 
A: It was totaled. 
 
Q:  Do you know what she was trying to light?

Q:  She was trying to light drugs? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q:  Do you know who took- 
 
A: This drug, you know, marijuana-? I don't know. 
 
 MR. KELLY: Percodan? 
 
 THE WITNESS: I don't know. Cocaine. I don't know. 
 
 BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q: Do you know who took responsibility for  that accident? 
 
A: Well, what happened was they were so 
 
 drunk that evening-that evening that Nicole was afraid to take the 
sobriety test, so what Faye did was Faye said, "I will take the 
sobriety test. I can make it.. So she did pass the sobriety test, and 
from then on Nicole owed her life to Faye. 
 
Q:  Now, did Nicole tell you this story? 
 
A:  Nicole told me and Faye told me. 
 
Q:  There have been some reports that you have been or are dating 
Mr. Simpson. Those are completely untrue? 
 
A: Untrue. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading the  witness. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q: You've never dated OJ. Simpson. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Leading the witness. 
 
THE WITNESS: That is so untrue. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q: And it's simply a figment of the tabloids. True? 
 
A: True. 
 
 MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Lead-ing the  witness. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q: You were Nicole's best friend for four 
 
 years. True? A: True. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Leading. BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q:  And you observed her relationship with OJ. better than anyone. 
True? 
 
A: So far as I know, yes. 
 
Q: And you don't believe OJ. Simpson killed Nicole Simpson. 
True? 
 
 MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes, true. 
 
 MR. BAKER: I've got nothing further. 
 
 MR. KELLY: You want to go ahead? Are you only  going to be 
like a half hour? 
 
 MR. BREWER: Yeah, I'll go.  EXAMINATION 
 
 BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q: Miss Fischman, my name is Michael Brewer,  and I represent 
Sharon Rufo. I have just a few  questions for you. 
 
 You had said earlier that Nicole was  afraid of OJ. Simpson. Is 
that true? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: And when you say "afraid," she was afraid 
 
 for her physical safety. Is that true? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Physical and I guess because of her-because of 
his voice. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q: Okay.  What about his voice? 
 
A: Well, she said that OJ. has a very, very strong voice, you know, 
and it's a scary voice. 
 
Q: So would it be fair to say that as of  June of 1994, you were 
aware that Nicole Simpson was afraid-physically afraid of OJ. 
Simpson? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q: Is that a fair statement? 
 
A: Well, you know, when she said, "I'm  afraid"-not afraid.  You 
know, "I'm afraid of  OJ.," yes, physically afraid, yes. 
 
Q: In fact she told you about a 1989  incident in which he had 
beaten her. Is that true? 
 
 MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
 THE WITNESS: That's true. 
 
 BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q: And he had caused her physical injury.  Is that true? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: True. 
 
BY MR. BREWER:  Q:  And she had even told you or you had 
even made a comparison-she had made a comparison with you 
with respect to bruising that she had received in connection with 
that beating when you were talking about bruising that you had on 
your body. True? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: Has Nicole ever told you that anyone else  has ever beaten her? 
 
A: If Nicole told me? 
 
Q:  Yeah. Did Nicole tell you, other than Mr. Simpson- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:-has she ever told you that anyone,  anyone in this universe, has 
beaten her? 
 
A: She never told me anything. 
 
Q: Has she told you that anyone has caused  her physical harm 
other than OJ. Simpson? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So as of the time of her death, the only  person that she had ever 
told you about or that you had knowledge of that had caused her 
physical harm was  OJ. Simpson. Is that true? 
 
A: True. 
 
 Q: Has Nicole Brown Simpson ever told you that she was afraid of 
anyone else other than OJ. Simpson? 
 
A: She was afraid of anyone? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Did she ever identify a person by name and indicated to you 
that she was afraid of that person? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: The only person in the universe that Nicole Brown Simpson has 
ever identified to you as a  person that she was afraid of was OJ. 
Simpson. Is that true? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: True. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q: And as of June of l994, that would also  be true. Correct? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: True. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q: Is there anything that you ever observed during the course of 
seeing Nicole and Mr. Simpson  that caused you to disbelieve the 
sincerity of her statement that she was afraid of OJ Simpson?  MR. 
KRAMER: Do you understand the question? 
 
THE WITNESS: She was afraid? 
 
MR. KRAMER: He is not asking if she was afraid. Was there 
anything- perhaps the question should be read back. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q: Well, why don't you see if you understand the question before I 
start 
 
reasking it. Do you  understand what I'm asking you? 
 
A: No. 
 
 MR. BAKER: That's a worthy "Could you be more  vague" 
objection. 
 
 MR. BREWER: Excuse me? 
 
 MR. BAKER: "Could you be more vague"  objection. 
 
 MR. BREWER: Well, I thought that was  copyrighted. 
 
 MR. PETROCELLI: Like father, like son. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q: Let me ask it a different way: When  Nicole indicated to you 
that she was afraid, you believed her. Right.' 
 
A: Did I believe it? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
 A: Yes. 
 
Q:  You didn't believe she was making it up. Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  You didn't believe that her statement or her concerns with 
respect to her being afraid of OJ. were insincere. Is that true? 
 
A: Was what? 
 
Q: Insincere. 
 
A: True. 
 
Q:  Is there anything that you ever observed  during the course of 
that relationship between OJ.  and Nicole that led you to believe 
that Nicole's  statement about being afraid of OJ. 
 
Simpson was  insincere? 
 
A: Led to believe? I don't... 
 
Q: Your answer is no? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Now, how did you first hear of  Nicole's death? 
 
A: How did I first hear? Pam Schwartz told  me. 
 
Q: By telephone? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  And did you go over to her house? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  Did you drive over there? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q:  Were you wearing jogging attire when you got over there? 
 
A:  Yes. I was waiting for her call. 
 
Q:  Okay. You were at home waiting for Nicole's call? 
 
A:  Yeah, because we were going to run. 
 
Q:  And Pam Schwartz called you? A:  Yeah. 
 
 Q:  And told you that she had been killed? 
 
A:  Yeah. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you anything about the facts  and circumstances of 
her murder? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you whether anyone else was  involved? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Did she tell you whether there was  another victim., 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  When you went over to the murder scene,  did you have a 
chance to see actually where Nicole's  body was? 
 
 A:  At the time I saw a lot of blood. There was blood all over the 
gate, and there was a lot of-you know, the dogs, and they told me 
that... 
 
Q:  Let me ask a question:  Who did you talk to? 
 
MR. KRAMER: At the scene at the time when she arrived? 
 
MR. BREWER: Yeah. 
 
Q:  The time we're talking about, at the  scene of the murder when 
you went over there, who did you talk to? 
 
A: I talked to a policeman there. 
 
Q:  Did they tell you that someone else was  also a victim, 
 
A: No. I just said, "What happened here?" 
 
Q:  And what did that person tell you? 
 
A: They said, "We can't give you any  information." 
 
Q: Was that a uniformed police officer? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
 Q And so the only thing you knew is that  Nicole had been killed. 
Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Did you assume that she had been killed  on the pathway into 
her property because of the blood 
 
 that you observed? A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Did you know anything about how she had been killed? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did anyone else say anything to you at the murder scene with 
respect to the facts and circumstances of the murders other than the 
statement by a police officer that she had been killed? 
 
A:  Well, they made-the police told me to  talk to the two guys, and 
they said, "Identify yourself." 
 
 I said, "I'm Nicole's friend.. And the first question they asked me 
is,  "What was OJ."-"Was OJ. at the recital?" 
 
  I said "Yes. What happened here?" And  then so I said- 
 
And they asked, "What was he wearing?"  And they said, "What 
kind of shoes was he wearing at  the recital?" I said, "He was.-I 
don't remember.  He was wearing black loafers with no socks." 
That's  what I said. 
 
Q:  Do you understand why they were asking  those questions with 
respect to Mr. Simpson? 
 
 A: Well, at that time I said, "Why? He did it?" you know. At the 
time that was the first thing that entered my mind. I mean, my God, 
he did this? You know. 
 
Q:  So you drew some association between the questions that you 
were being asked with Mr. Simpson- 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q:-and his possible involvement? 
 
A: Because I thought he was caught. I thought that, you know, that 
they got him or  something. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Just so my question is clear and  your answer is clear, 
though, at the time that you  were being asked questions with 
respect to Mr. Simpson's attire and whether he was at the  recital, 
you drew some association between  Mr. Simpson's possible 
involvement in these murders  and being asked these questions. 
 
 Is that a fair statement? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
 MR. BAKER: Leading.  BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q:  And then you ran away from the murder  scene, right, being 
mobbed by media and questions? 
 
 A: Exactly, yeah. 
 
Q:  And did you go home at that time? A: Yes.  Yes. 
 
Q:  Did you begin to watch the news? A: At that time my phone 
was ringing. I don't know. I mean, everything was -I was-it was a 
lot of confusion already at the time. 
 
Q:  You were confused because your best friend had just been 
killed. 
 
A:  Yeah, I was shocked. I was numb. I was, you know-I didn't 
know what was going on. 
 
Q:  You didn't know what happened. Right? 
 
A: I didn't know what happened. 
 
Q: : You were interested in finding out what  happened. Right? 
 
A: Of course I was. 
 
Q:  And it was important to you to find out  why Nicole was killed 
and who killed her. Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: And I take it during the day you  attempted to develop 
information or illicit  information to answer those questions for 
you. Is  that true? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q:  And you turned on the news. Is that true? 
 
A: Right.  True. 
 
Q:  And did you contact friends of Nicole's? 
 
A: Yeah, people were calling me already. Everybody was calling 
me at that time. 
 
Q:  People were calling you for information? 
 
A:  I mean the media, friends of Nicole, and they were saying, you 
know, "I'm sorry you lost your friend," you know.  At that time 
everybody was calling.  The phone was ringing a lot. 
 
Q:  Let's be clear on something. People were calling you. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Were you calling other people? 
 
A: I was also calling, yeah. 
 
Q:  Okay. Because you were trying to find  out what happened. Is 
that true? 
 
A:  True. 
 
Q:  You were trying to find out who was  responsible. Is that true? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: And who did you first call to find out- 
 
A: Who? 
 
Q:-who was responsible? Who was the very first person that you 
called to find out this information that may lead to the idendty of 
the persons responsible for this murder? 
 
A: I first called? 
 
Q: Yes. Who did you call? 
 
A: I don't know. I was-I called my sister-in-law in the car. I called 
Ron, you know. 
 
Q:  So you called your husband? 
 
A: Yeah. I told him what happened. 
 
Q:  Had he heard anything about the murders when you talked to 
him., 
 
A: He didn't know about it. 
 
Q:  So your communication with trim was the  very first 
information he had relative- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:-to these murders? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  What did he say when you told him that Nicole had been 
killed? 
 
A: He said, "I'm sorry. I'm sorry, you  know. 
 
Q:  Did you tell Ron that you had been asked  questions about OJ. 
Simpson? 
 
A: No. At the time we were just like -I  was just calling-I called the 
school, you know. 
 
That's pretty much what happened. 
 
Q:  Well, didn't it cross your mind that perhaps Mr. Simpson was 
involved? 
 
A: It did cross my mind, yeah, sure. 
 
Q:  And the reason why it crossed your mind is that this was a 
person that Nicole Brown Simpson had told you that she was afraid 
of. Right? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q:  Isn't that true? 
 
A: Yes, true. 
 
Q:  And this was a person that had physically  beaten her in the 
past. Isn't that true? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. Assumes facts not in  evidence. 
 
THE WITNESS: True. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q:  And that caused you to begin thinking that maybe Mr. Simpson 
was the person who committed this horrific murder. Isn't that true? 
 
A:  True. 
 
Q:  Now, was there at some point during that  first day a 
conversation that you had with someone  where you expressed this 
suspicion? 
 
A:  Yeah. You know, we were trying to figure out what happened, 
you know, who could have done this. If OJ. did it, why did he do 
it. So we were trying to- trying to figure out, trying to find 
answers. 
 
Q:  When you say "we," are you talking about- 
 
A:  I mean like [Name Deleted] and Kris Jenner and, you know, 
my sister-in-law [Name Deleted], and I was... [Name Deleted]. 
You know we're trying to figure out, you know what really 
happened here, you know. That's-my friends. 
 
Q:  Was one of the themes that was running between these 
communications that you were having with  your friends the fact 
that OJ. might have done this? 
 
 MR. BAKER: Vague. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes, we were trying to figure out  what really 
happened. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q:  Okay.  And at some point during that day did you and your 
husband, Mr. Fischman, have a  discussion with respect to the 
possibility that  OJ. Simpson killed Nicole? 
 
A: Yeah, we talked about that, too. 
 
Q: All right. And did Mr. Fischman indicate  to you that he 
suspected that Mr. Simpson was  responsible for the death of 
Nicole? 
 
A: If my husband thought? 
 
Q:  Did he tell you that he thought OJ. Simpson killed Nicole? 
 
A: Well, we all thought that the first time when we heard the 
incident, the whole thing. 
 
Q: When you say, "we all thought that...when we heard the 
incident," you mean when you heard that Nicole was murdered- 
 
A: The first- 
 
Q: Excuse me.-everyone that you knew and talked to that day drew 
the same conclusion that you did: That  Mr. Simpson was the 
person that was responsible for  the Nicole's murder. Is that what 
you're saying? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: Including Ron Fischman? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q:  Okay. Can you identify every single  person-you've identified 
some of them. I want to  get a complete list of the people that you 
talked to  that day. [Name Deleted], right, was one of them.' 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: [Name Deleted]. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Your husband. Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Your sister-in-law? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Who else? 
 
A: [Name Deleted]. 
 
Q:  Okay. 
 
A: My brothers, my sister, friends,  neighbors that came. 
 
Q:  What neighbors did you talk to about Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: Oh, no neighbors, no, no, no, no, no. I  was gonna say our 
neighbor, but we shooed her away.  We said, "No, we didn't want 
to talk." 
 
 Oh, who else. That was pretty much... 
 
Q:  Okay.  And during the day were you continuing to monitor the 
news developments? 
 
A: Uh-huh, yes. 
 
Q: And were you getting tidbits of  information relative to 
evidence that was being  developed and the facts and 
circumstances of the  murders? 
 
A: True, yes. 
 
Q: At some point did you learn that there  was another victim., 
 
 A: Yes. 
 
Q:  When was that? 
 
A: When was that? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
A: Actually when I was-when I heard that there was another 
victim, I said, "Oh, my God, it's either Ron Goldman or the guy at 
Toscana, Mark." 
 
Q: So you- 
 
A: So at the time when it was not  identified, I thought of those two 
people. 
 
Q:  So the very first time that you heard  there was another victim- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: First of all, did you know it was a male  victim.; 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: The very first time that you heard there was another victim, it 
was identified as a male  victim; you drew an association between 
that victim  and Ron Goldman or someone at Toscana's? 
 
A: The waiter at Toscana. 
 
Q:  [Name Deleted]? 
 
A: No. Mark. Mark. 
 
Q: Mark.  What's Mark's last name? 
 
A:  I forgot his name. But Mark-he was 
 
 one of the pallbearers. I forgot his last name. 
 
Q:   Why did you suspect that Mark may be the other victim? 
 
A: Because Nicole was very attracted to Mark, and at that time-see, 
Nicole went to Mezzaluna, and Ron and I and our kids went to 
Toscana so-and Mark was there. So I thought that since Mark saw 
me at Toscana, oh, probably Nicole-or Mark must have called 
Nicole and said, you know, "Oh, guess  who I saw? Cora was here 
with her family." So that's why I thought of Mark. 
 
Q:  And so you thought of Mark because he may  have been having 
a relationship with Nicole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  And you thought of Ron Goldman for the same reason? 
 
A: For the same reason, yes.  Yes. 
 
Q:  That he was having a relationship with Nicole? 
 
A:  That Ron was interested in Nicole, was  attracted to Nicole. 
 
Q:  And I take it the reason why you drew an  association between 
these two individuals, Ron and the  person at Toscana, was because 
you assumed that it was  Mr. Simpson acting on some jealousy. 
 
Q:  Is that a fair statement? 
 
A:  Acting on jealousy? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: I mean, you assumed that he probably came upon Nicole with a 
male suitor and then killed him Is that what you were assuming at 
the time? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
 MR. PETROCELLI: John, you were supposed to be covering for 
him. 
 
 MR. KELLY: The mike wouldn't reach. 
 
 MR. BREWER: Got to cover my back there, Kelly. 
 
 MR. BAKER: I'm sorry. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q:  Okay. Apart from learning that there was another victim 
involved what other information did you hear on the 13th with 
respect to either  information that tended to implicate Mr. Simpson 
or  just general evidence that was being discussed in the  media? 
 
A:  Well, it was basically the evidence  coming out of the media. 
 
Q: Well, like what do you remember hearing?  What type of 
evidence? 
 
 A: They said, oh, they saw blood on the driveway and they saw 
the gloves. That's pretty much, you know... 
 
Q: Blood in Mr. Simpson's driveway? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Do you remember hearing about that? 
 
A: They said there were three- there was blood on the driveway- 
that was the first one that said, "Oh, they found blood on the 
driveway." 
 
Q:  Okay. So you heard the first day that they had found- 
 
A:  First, second day. No, not the first  day. I don't think I even 
listened. I was-all I  know is everything was a daze, and it was just-
it was... Oh, I'm sorry. 
 
Q:  Let me just ask a question:  Would it be fair to say that rather 
than pinpoint it to Monday or Tuesday, that within the first couple 
days you were  hearing information through the media that related 
to  evidence that was being developed for Mr. Simpson's  possible 
implication in these murders? 
 
Is that a fair statement? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  One of the things you heard about was the  fact that blood was 
found on the Rockingham driveway. 
 
 Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did you also hear that there was a glove found on his property? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Did you also hear that blood was found at Bundy? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Did you also hear that the blood that was  found at Bundy was 
identified as blood belonging to OJ. Simpson? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Now, when you began to hear this  information, did it reaffirm 
your initial suspicions  that Mr. Simpson was responsible for the 
death of Nicole? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes, but it was like I was in  disbelief, you know.  
It was like hard to believe, that it can't happen. It can't happen. 
Because I know these people, you know. It was like- 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q:  You didn't want to believe it was true? 
 
A: Yes. It was like-it was I can't believe it.  You know, is this 
happening? Is this really true? You know. 
 
Q:  You didn't want to believe that  OJ. Simpson could annually 
kill Nicole. Right? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q: Despite not wanting to believe that, you developed an initial 
suspicion that OJ. Simpson was responsible for the death of 
Nicole. Is that true? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: And all of the information that you began  to hear-the blood on 
his driveway, the glove that  was found at Rockingham, the blood 
that was found at  Bundy-that was affirming your initial suspicion  
that OJ. Simpson was responsible for the death of  Nicole. 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q:  Is that a fair statement? 
 
A:  That's true, yeah. 
 
Q:  Now, during the first couple weeks do you  recall hearing any 
information that, when you thought  about learning-when you 
thought about the information that you heard, you drew a 
conclusion that  it supported an opinion that Mr. Simpson was not 
 
responsible, something that was contrary to implicating him as 
involved in these murders? 
 
MR. BAKER: From the med-? 
 
MR. BREWER: Yeah.  Any source. 
 
THE WITNESS:  Any source from the media? 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q:  Sure. 
 
A:  Well, at the time I thought like, why they not looking for other 
suspects. You know, why  they lead to OJ. at the time. I said, 
"Nicole at the  time was going out a lot with Faye. Why couldn't 
they  look for other possibilities," because they were  doing- you 
know, because Nicole-Faye was doing  cocaine. And so I said, 
could it be drugs, you know,  could it be, you know, cocaine, all 
these things.  Yes, I opened my mind to all these possibilities. 
 
Q: You didn't want to believe it was  OJ. Simpson, so you went 
looking for other possible explanations. Is- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:-that true?  And you had mentioned in previous  testimony that 
the lifestyle that Nicole was leading  was a dangerous lifestyle.  Is 
that true? 
 
A:  Pretty much, yeah.  The last weeks, yes. 
 
 Q:  When you say a dangerous lifestyle," are you talking about 
danger from the standpoint of her own physical safety? 
 
A: No. Dangerous because she was going out a lot with Faye and 
doing this soliciting, doing threesome and soliciting men, and I 
thought that that was-to me that was a dangerous lifestyle. That's 
how I- 
 
Q: Well, when you say "dangerous," are you  talking about 
dangerous because she may develop AIDS or some illness- 
 
A: Yes, yes- 
 
Q:  -or are you-excuse me- talking  about danger became 
somebody may come home and kill  her? What kind of danger are 
you talking about? 
 
A: Pretty much everything dangerous that-she actually was afraid 
of AIDS, too, you know. Health likewise. Dangerous lifestyle.  It's-
that's  how you call it: Dangerous lifestyle. 
 
Q: Well- 
 
A: I don't mean physically-it could be physical, too, because 
somebody-a lot of the guys  that they've been going out, to me they 
could harm 
 
her, because she's a very attractive woman. 
 
Q:  Okay.  But when you have used the term a "dangerous 
lifestyle" during the course of this deposition, in your mind what 
you're thinking about principally is developing AIDS or some 
other virus or illness as a result of this type of lifestyle? 
 
A:  It's-not just that. It's just a lifestyle. It's kind of like she was 
playing with fire. She was going out, soliciting men and, you  
know, going out with Faye to different clubs and stuff like that. 
 
Q:  Did she ever tell you that she was afraid  of any of the men that 
she had dated? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Did she ever tell you that anyone 
 
that  she had dated threatened her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she ever tell you that any of the men  she dated stalked her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Did she ever tell you that any of the men  that she dated made 
threatening phone calls to her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Now, at some point, as you indicated in  earlier testimony, you 
came to the conclusion that 
 
Mr. Simpson is innocent. Do you recall that testimony? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When did you first come to that conclusion in your mind where 
you firmly believed that he was innocent? 
 
A:  When all the evidences were not matching up, and also when 
the verdict came out, as you say, you know, I always said that let 
the justice-I  believe in the justice system, and we'll believe it like 
that. You know, I figured that's what happened.  I mean, he was 
found innocent, he's innocent. 
 
Q:  Was that when you determined that he was  innocent:  When 
the verdict came out? 
 
A: No, when all the-I just-I doubted  about the gloves.  The socks 
is just the one that made me wonder. There were no blood around 
the socks, and the carpet, his carpet leading to his bedroom is  
white.  How come there were no blood stains leading to  his 
bedroom. 
 
Q:  When was the first time in your mind you  came to the 
conclusion Mr. Simpson was innocent? 
 
A:  When this whole trial was going on. 
 
Q:  When? 
 
A:  I'm sorry. What? 
 
 Q:  The trial was a year long. What I am trying to figure out, at 
some point did you come to a conclusion in your mind that Mr. 
Simpson was innocent? 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: When he was innocent? When all those gloves 
and- you know, annually it started when they talked about Mark 
Fuhrman and- you know, whatever, that time frame. That's when I 
said, my God, you know, there's no way he could have done this. 
 
 BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q: Okay. So you drew some association  between the discussions 
about Mark Fuhrman as to when  you determined that Mr. Simpson 
was innocent? Is that  true? 
 
A: No, that's not true.  It's around that  when they talked about the 
other evidences, too. 
 
Q:  The socks? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: The glove? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Okay.  And that led you to the conclusion  that you've expressed 
during the course of the deposition that Mr. Simpson is innocent. 
Right? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q:  You also testified that you were -you 
 
didn't really follow the trial. Is that true? 
 
A: I was not allowed to. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: Because I was on subpoena. 
 
Q: So when you were-when were you subpoenaed? 
 
A: It was January of '94. 
 
Q: So did you watch- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: '95. 
 
MR. KARMA: '95, perhaps? 
 
THE WITNESS: Oh, I'm sorry. '95.

Q:  Did you watch any televised coverage of  the trial after January 
of '95? 
 
A:  I was not interested. Off and on, you  know, I would read the 
news, but not really-I  didn't watch it every day, no. 
 
Q:  Well, did you watch any of the televised  coverage at all after 
you were subpoenaed in January  of 1995? 
 
A: Watch at all? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
A: How can you? I mean, every channel  was-yes, I would say yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Well, they told you not to, didn't 
 
 they? A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you continue to watch periodic coverage of the trial? 
A: No, I didn't watch periodically, no. 
 
Q: Did you watch at all? 
 
A: How can you miss it? I mean, it's every day.  It's every channel.  
And you talk about it. Yeah, I mean I saw a few, yeah, but didn't sit 
there  for three hours watching it, no. 
 
Q: Well, it was important to you to watch the trial because you 
were hoping it would help answer  the question as to who killed 
Nicole, your best  friend. Right? 
 
  MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: See, at the time I wasn't really  interested in the 
trial because I couldn't stand  watching it and-to me it was boring, 
anyway.  It  was boring. Got to be too long, so... 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q:  Well, did you resist watching the trial because you were afraid 
of some of the information  that you might hear? 
 
A:  No.  Partly because I was on subpoena,  I'm not supposed to 
watch it. So that's also part of 
 
 the reason why I wasn't watching it. 
 
Q: Did Mr.- 
 
A: So I don't know what time I was going to be called, and, you 
know, I wasn't supposed to watch it, so... 
 
Q: Did you ever have any discussions with Mr. Simpson's 
attorneys about whether you should watch the trial or not watch the 
trial? 
 
A: No, they never told me that. 
 
Q: When you first spoke with Mr. Simpson, that was by telephone 
after his arrest, correct, when  he was incarcerated? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you spoke with him at the wake,  correct, which has 
already been described? 
 
A: Yes.  Yes. 
 
Q: Was that the sum total of your  
 
conversation:  Pounding on his chest and then making  the 
comment that you made? 
 
A: That was-yeah, that was pretty much,  yes. 
 
Q: Did you speak with him at the funeral? 
 
A: No. I must have gone and, you know, said  hello, but not-not-no 
major conversation. 
 
Q: While you were at the wake, were there 
 
conversations between you and Nicole's friends about Mr. 
Simpson's possible involvement in the murder? 
 
A: At the time we couldn't talk because we were all shocked, so we 
were-no. 
 
Q:  Were you talking about it among yourselves quietly, 
whispering that- you know, what had happened, what type of 
information had been disseminated through the media? 
 
A:  I don't think we were talking like that. 
 
Q:  Did you ever overhear any conversations between Mr. Simpson 
and anyone else at the wake with  respect to whether he was 
involved in this murder? 
 
A:  I ever heard? 
 
Q:  Did you overhear any conversations between Mr. Simpson and 
anyone else with respect to whether he was involved in the 
murder? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: At the funeral did you overhear any  conversations between Mr. 
Simpson and anyone else  wherein there was a discussion 
concerning the facts  and circumstances of the murders? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you talk with anyone at the funeral  with respect to whether 
Mr. Simpson was possibly the  person who killed Nicole? 
 
 A: Did I talk to anyone? 
 
Q: At the funeral, yes. 
 
A: Did I talk at the funeral with anyone. Yeah, I talked to-I talked 
to a lot of people. I mean, I talked to Faye in the car- 
 
Q:  Did you talk about-well, let's 
 
take Faye.  Did you and Faye talk about OJ. Simpson possibly 
being the person who killed Nicole? 
 
A: No. When we were in the car, we talked  about-about-actually 
about Ron. I said, you  know, "You were giggling." Who was?"  
She asked me if I spoke to Nicole that  evening. I said no. 
 
 And I asked her if she did, and she said, "Yes, we spoke around 
9:30,. and I told you that they were giggling and stuff like that, 
yeah. 
 
Q: Did you have any discussions with Faye  that were specific to 
whether OJ. Simpson killed  Nicole? 
 
A: Must have, yes, yes. 
 
Q: You must have? 
 
A: Probably, because I'm not sure. I mean,  it was like that time we 
were all grieving. We were  all shocked.  We didn't know. So I 
would say yes, we 
 
 talked about who did it. 
 
Q:  Okay. When you say "we," who is "we"? 
 
A: Who did it? Well, you know, we talked with the Browns, with 
Kris- you know, the Jenners were there, [Name Deleted], you 
know. 
 
Q:  Okay. When you say "they" were there, were you all in this 
limousine having this discussion? 
 
A: Yeah. Not the Browns, but I mean in the limousine, yes. 
 
Q:  So was there some generalized discussion in the limousine ride 
with respect to whether  Mr. Simpson killed Nicole? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: No, we didn't really talk that  much. We really-
we just 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q: My question is whether there was any, not  whether you talked 
about it a lot or a little.  Was  there any discussion in the limousine 
ride- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:-with respect to whether OJ. Simpson  killed Nicole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And who was discussing that? 
 
A: Who? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Everyone. 
 
Q: Well, what did Christian Reichardt say about it? 
 
MR. BAKER: Was he in the car? 
 
MR. BREWER: I don't know. She said "everyone." 
 
Q: Was he in the car? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: She said he was in the car. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes, he was in the car. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q: What did Christian Reichardt say? 
 
A: Christian said that-actually, you know what? They were all-we 
were quiet.  We were not  talking there. 
 
Q: Ma'am, you just said that there was some  discussion- 
 
A:  I'm getting confused here. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Well, let's just refocus on my  question. You are in a 
limousine ride- 
 
A: Let me tell you what happened, then. 
 
MR. KARMA:  Is that all right? 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q: Yeah, tell me what happened. 
 
MR. KRAMER:  Go ahead. 
 
THE WITNESS: Well, at the time we were all crying; we were 
shocked. Christian and Faye were not talking okay, so we were 
talking about her- the intervention more. I said, "What happened?" 
And to me that was- and then we said, "Do you think he might 
have killed"-yeah, we talked about-yeah, sure we did. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q:  Okay. Well, that's what I want to focus  on. 
 
A: Yeah, but nobody answered yes or no. It  was an open question 
because of what the media was  feeding us, yes. 
 
Q: Who raised the question? Who was the  first one in that 
limousine that said, "Do you think OJ. could have done it?" 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q:  I mean, who started the conversation? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q:  Did you? 
 
A: No, I don't know. I don't think so. 
 
Q:  Okay. Did you say anything when that  question was thrown 
out for discussion? 
 
A: We were just- we were shocked, so I 
 
Pa-595 
 
don't remember. It was-we were all shocked. 
 
Q:  Well, do you recall anyone in the limousine who said, "I think 
OJ. did it"? 
 
A: No, no one said that. 
 
Q: Do you recall anyone who said, "I think OJ. did it"? 
 
A:  No, no one said that. 
 
Q:  Do you recall anyone who said, "OJ did not do it"? 
 
A:  No, no one said that. 
 
Q:  What was the general tenor of the  discussion when somebody 
said, "Do you think OJ. did  it."  Were people saying he did or he 
didn't or  discussing the evidence? What exactly was being said? 
 
MR. BAKER:  Speculation and leading a la  Petrocelli. 
 
THE WITNESS: We were all quiet. We were  shocked. So we 
were saying, "Do you think OJ. did it?" And that was it. It was like 
a question, a big question in our mind.  But we didn't draw a 
conclusion.  We were just like in disbelief. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q:  Okay.  That's the best you can do  relating to us what 
discussion there was in the limousine relative to whether Mr. 
Simpson was responsible for the murder? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  How about at the funeral itself? Were there any further 
discussions between you and anyone else with respect to Mr. 
Simpson's possible involvement? 
 
A:  At the funeral?  Actually, I told Kato, I said, you know, "They 
called me. You're the other suspect here," and we kinda kid around, 
"and I told  the media there was no way you were gonna be a 
suspect.  You don't even"-you know, "you can't even hurt a fly." So 
that was one of our  conversation, yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. And you were relating to Kato a  conversation that you 
had had with the police where  they asked you questions about 
Kato? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  And you knew right away that Kato  couldn't possibly be a 
suspect. Right? 
 
A:  There was no way. No way. 
 
Q:  And so in your mind you ruled out  immediately Kato Kaelin 
as a suspect because of what  you knew about Kato. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: That he wasn't violent? 
 
A:  Kato? 
 
Q:  Yes.  He was not violent. 
 
A: He was not violent, yes. 
 
Q:  He had never had any violent episodes with Nicole. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  As far as you knew, Nicole wasn't afraid of Kato, was she? 
 
A: No, Nicole was not afraid of Kato. 
 
Q: Do you recall any other discussions, other than this 
conversation with Kato, while you were at the funeral with respect 
to whether Mr. Simpson was responsible for Nicole's death? 
 
A:  It was also Judy told me, you know. 
 
Q:  What did Judy say? 
 
A: Judy said, "Cora," you know, something like, "do you think he 
did it?" you know. 
 
Q:  What did you say? 
 
A: I said, "I don't know. I don't know." 
 
Q:  And that was the sum total- 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q:-of that conversation? 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  Did you have any other conversations with  anyone else other 
than Kato end Judy at the funeral with respect to whether Mr. 
Simpson was responsible for these murders? 
 
A: We were all quiet. I mean, we were mourning.  We were 
mourning. I mean, you know, we were skill shocked and confused, 
so-we didn't draw any conclusion. Everything was a big question 
mark to us. 
 
Q: Now, those are the only two times during the week of the 13th 
that you actually saw  Mr. Simpson. Is that true ? At the wake and 
at the funeral. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  I think you had mentioned actually  another occasion: Where 
you saw him with  Mr. Kardashian. Is that true? 
 
A:  Oh, yes, yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. So those are the only three occasions where you 
physically saw Mr. Simpson during  the week of the 13th? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And I take it you watched the chase on  the 17th? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And did you draw a conclusion that  Mr. Simpson was 
going to commit suicide? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q:  And how did you factor in that information, if you did at all, 
with respect to our belief that Mr. Simpson may or may not be 
responsible for the death of Nicole? 
 
MR. BAKER: Vague. 
 
THE WITNESS: How? 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A:  At the time when I sew the chase, I was  in disbelief. I said, 
"What's going on now? What is he doing now?" So I only-all I 
thought was the  kids. I said, "I can't believe what will happen to 
Sydney and Justin." 
 
Q:  The next time that you spoke with  Mr. Simpson or saw him 
was when he telephoned you from jail.  Is that correct? 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  And that was after Faye Resnick had  published her book. Is 
that correct? 
 
A:  Barbara Walters.  After Barbara Walters. 
 
Q:  After you did the Barbara Walters? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
 Q:  Did Mr. Simpson indicate to you that he saw that on TV? 
 
A:  No, he didn't see it on TV.  He got a call from a friend.  He 
spoke to a friend and-from New York, I think, and that his friend 
said that "Cora Fischman spoke, and by far you could tell that she 
was the only real friend of Nicole among the three who spoke." 
 
Q:  So it was your understanding that the call was instigated- Mr. 
Simpson's call was instigated because he received a call from a 
friend in  New York who told him that you had been on Barbara  
Walters. 
 
A: Exactly. 
 
Q:  And that's what Mr. Simpson told you. 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And did he ask you questions at that time about conversations 
you had had with Nicole in the past concerning OJ. Simpson? 
 
A:  Oh, yeah. I mean, we were both crying.  That was the first time 
I spoke to him.  We were  crying, and basically we were-he was 
asking me,  "What happened here? What happened?" you know, 
and we  were just-we were both crying, trying to relive Nicole. 
 
 I actually even told him, I said, "Why are you doing this to me? 
Why are we reliving Nicole?" so... 
 
Q: Did he ask you about prior incidents where Nicole told you-I'm 
sorry. Strike that. 
 
Did he ask you about conversations you and Nicole had had where 
Nicole related to you incidents where Mr. Simpson had beat her? 
Did he ask you questions about that? 
 
A: If Nicole? 
 
Q:  Told you. 
 
 MR. BAKER: He is asking if OJ. told you  about what- 
 
THE WITNESS: OJ. never told me 
 
anything. 
 
 MR. BREWER: Don't let him reask my questions. 
 
 MR. BAKER: I get lost in these triple  hearsays. 
 
 THE WITNESS: I mean, it's- 
 
 BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q:  Did Mr. Simpson ask you questions about the communications 
you and Nicole had concerning  beatings in the relationship? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Did he ask you questions whether Nicole  had told you about 
the '89 incident? 
 
 A: Did who again? 
 
Q:  Did OJ. Simpson ask you whether Nicole had told you about 
the '89 incident? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And that was during this phone call? 
 
A: Oh, no, not on the phone call. 
 
Q:  That's what I am talking about, the phone call- 
 
A:  Oh, the phone call? 
 
Q:  What I am trying to find out is what he asked you about in the 
phone call. 
 
A:  Oh, I don't know about the phone call. I  mean, it was like-not 
that, no. 
 
Q:  How long was the phone call? 
 
A: I don't know. I don't remember. Ten  minutes? 
 
Q: Ten minutes? 
 
A: Five minutes? It was not a long  conversation. He just thanked 
me for being a friend  of Nicole's "And by far you're Nicole's only 
friend." 
 
Q:  Did he ever say he didn't commit the  murder? 
 
A: Yeah, he said that. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Did you ask him at that time about  some of the 
evidence that was 
 
 A:  No. 
 
Q:  -had a tendency to implicate him.' 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Didn't you want to know? 
 
A:  Actually I said to him-I was blaming. I said, you know, "I told 
you, why didn't you go to Florida?.  You know, I was kind of 
blaming him. I said, "Why didn't you go to Florida? Why didn't 
you go? You could have moved," you know, so that's what  
happened. 
 
Q:  What's the implication of that statement,  "Why didn't you go 
to Florida?" 
 
A: Well, to me I thought that if they  started a new life in a 
different state, then probably  Nicole would have still been married 
to OJ. 
 
Q:  When OJ. Simpson called you on the  telephone from jail, that 
very first call, you believed he killed Nicole didn't you? 
 
 MR. BAKER: Leading. Argumentative. 
 
 THE WITNESS: Did I believe? 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q:  Yes.  In your mind you believed that  OJ. Simpson had killed 
Nicole when he first called  you. 
 
A:  I thought about it, yes. 
 
 Q:  Okay. And during that discussion he told you he did not kill 
her. Is that right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Did you ask him any question at all about any of the evidence 
that you had learned about or his explanation? 
 
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: Did I ask any questions about the evidence? No. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q:  Yeah.  For example, how did blood get at Rockingham?  Did 
you ask him about that? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you ask him about the blood at Bundy? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you ask him about the glove that was  at Rockingham? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you ask him how blood got in his  Bronco? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you have any interest in learning any  of that information? 
 
 MR. BAKER: Argumentative. Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS:  At the time I was- I didn't ask. 
 
him, yeah.  Probably I was in disbelief, so... 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q: Well, this was a person who hopefully could answer these 
questions for you and had firsthand knowledge of this. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Is there any reason-Were you afraid of the answers? 
 
A: If I was afraid of the answers? 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
A: I was-I'm not afraid of the answers. 
 
Q:  Were you afraid that he may tell you  "Yeah, I did it"? 
 
A: Actually I wanted to know if he did it, yeah. 
 
Q:  Why didn't you ask him., 
 
A: You want me to ask him.' I didn't ask  him. No, I didn't. I didn't 
ask him. 
 
Q:  I guess what we are all wondering is:  You're Nicole's best 
friend. Why haven't you ever  asked him point- blank if he did it or 
ask him for his  explanation with respect to some of this evidence? 
 
A: Actually he asked me, he said, "Cora, do  you think I'm capable 
of killing Nicole?" 
 
 I said-and I said, "Only you can 
 
answer that, OJ.  "And I says, "Well, you know, do you think you 
were framed?" 
 
Yes, we did talk about that. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And when he asked you that question, whether you 
thought he was capable of killing Nicole, one of the things that you 
didn't say was no. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Because you did think he was capable,  didn't you? 
 
A: What? 
 
 a You did think he was capable. 
 
A: Everybody's capable, yes. 
 
Q:  particularly someone who had a history of  violence with his 
wife. Right? 
 
 MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
 THE WITNESS: See, I didn't know that OJ. was  a violent person. 
I didn't know that. 
 
 BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q:  You didn't know that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  So- 
 
A: I knew that he had a violent temper.  You  know, when he 
screams, he gets mad. He has a temper. 
 
Q:  You knew that firsthand. 
 
 A:  Nicole told me. 
 
Q:  Well, you knew that from your own personal observations, too, 
didn't you? 
 
A:  I never saw him like that. 
 
Q:  Well, Nicole told you that he had beaten her in 1989. Right? 
 
A: Yes, because they were all drunk at that party, yes. 
 
Q:  Did you think that their being drunk excused Mr. Simpson 
from beating his wife? 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: No, it's not an excuse, no. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q:  Well- 
 
A:  I mean- 
 
Q:  Go ahead. 
 
A:  Well, no. 
 
Q: So you knew at the time that you spoke to  Mr. Simpson that he 
had inflicted-he had had a  violent encounter with his wife. Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And you knew he had a bad temper. Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  You knew Nicole was afraid of him. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
 Q:  You knew Nicole was concerned about her safety not because 
she was going out at night, but because she was afraid of OJ. 
Simpson. You knew  that. 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q:  Right? 
 
A:  She was going out with who? 
 
Q:  You knew she was afraid of her safety not  because of the fact 
she was going out at night with Faye Resnick, but because of OJ. 
Simpson.  That was the fear that she had. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And based upon all that information, you  knew that Mr. 
Simpson had it within his ability to  kill Nicole. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
 MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
 BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q:  Has Mr. Simpson ever told you he was  framed? 
 
A: What? 
 
Q:  Has Mr. Simpson ever told you he was  framed? 
 
A: No. 
 
 Q:  Has he ever offered any explanation for any of the evidence in 
this case to you, ever? 
 
MR. BAKER: Vague. 
 
THE WITNESS: Explained? No. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q:  Have you ever had any discussions with Robert Kardashian in 
connection with this case? 
 
A: Robert Kardashian? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Have you ever had any discussions with  Al Cowlings? 
 
A: Al Cowlings? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  When did you first have any discussion? Let's talk about after 
June 13th, have  you had any discussions with Al Cowlings? 
 
A: We went for a walk one time down  San Vicente. 
 
Q:  When was that? 
 
A: When? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
A:  Oh, God, around July-no- June, later  part of June. 
 
 Q:  Okay. In the month of the murders? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  And how did that come about, that you were taking a walk with 
Al Cowlings? 
 
A: Well, we were frying to commiserate, trying to understand what 
really happened. 
 
Q:  When you say "what really happened," are you talking about 
who killed Nicole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you ask-did you have a discussion with Mr. Cowlings 
about Mr. Simpson  possibly killing Nicole? 
 
A:  Yeah.  He said-at first he said- at first he thought that OJ. did it. 
 
Q:  And Mr. Cowlings- 
 
A:  That was the first thing that entered his mind. 
 
Q:  So Mr. Cowlings told you that when he first learned of the 
murders, he concluded that  OJ. Simpson killed Nicole? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And did Mr. Cowlings tell you that Mr. Simpson had said 
anything to him that confirmed that initial suspicion? 
 
A:  No. 1 
 
Q:  Did you have any discussions with Mr. Cowlings with respect 
to the infamous slow-speed chase on June 17th? A: No. 
 
Q:  Did Mr. Cowlings relate to you anything at all that Mr. 
Simpson said to him during the week of the 13th? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Did Mr. Cowlings indicate to you that he had changed his view 
from his initial suspicion that Mr. Simpson was involved in these 
murders? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And what did he tell you? 
 
A:  He said, "By talking to OJ.," he said,  "there was no way he 
could have done it." 
 
Q: And did he tell you that OJ. had  explained, for example, his 
whereabouts at the time of  the murders? 
 
 MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
 THE WITNESS: I don't know. I'm- yeah, I  guess. I don't know. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q:  Well, did he tell you? 
 
A:  Did he tell me? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
 A:  No. 
 
Q:  For example, did he say, "OJ. couldn't have done it because he 
was in Chicago" or "he was at a party," or something else? 
 
A:  No, he didn't explain.  He didn't say that. 
 
Q: Was there any discussion between you and Mr. Cowlings with 
respect to Simpson's explanation regarding certain evidence in the 
case? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  So other than Al Cowlings' statement that after talking with OJ. 
he -"I don't think he could  have done it," did he tell you any of the 
particulars that were related to Mr. Cowlings by Mr. Simpson that  
supported Cowlings' belief? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Was that the only conversation you ever  had with Al 
Cowlings? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  How long did that conversation take place? 
 
A:  I'd say 15 minutes. 
 
Q:  And was that kind of a walk that you took  just to kind of 
commiserate? 
 
A:  Yes. 3 
 
Q:  And during the course of that walk, this topic came up as to 
whether Mr. Simpson could have  killed Nicole. Correct' 
 
A:  Well, I asked him, you know. I mean, I wanted answers, so... 
 
Q: So you asked- 
 
A:  And then we talked about the friends, you know, what 
happened, and the kids. That's pretty much- where were the kids 
that day. So he told me that Arnelle took the kids and stuff like 
that. 
 
Q:  Did Mr. Cowlings tell you anything about discussions he had 
with OJ. Simpson concerning the kids, taking care of the kids or 
providing for the  kids? 
 
A:  Did who? Did OJ.-I mean if A.C told  me? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: I don't remember. No, I don't remember. 
 
Q: Have you ever had any conversations with  Skip Taft? 
 
A: Skip? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
A:  I don't even know him. 
 
Q:  Cathy Randa? 
 
A:  I met Cathy two weeks ago. 
 
 Q:  And how did you meet Cathy? 
 
A:  At OJ.'s house. He said, "This is  Cathy." 
 
I said, "Hi." That was the first time I met her. 
 
Q:  Did you talk about this case at all? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you talk about the facts and  circumstances of the murders? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you have any discussion beyond just  an introduction, 
saying hello? 
 
A:  That was pretty much my conversation with  her. 
 
Q:  When you met with Mr. Leonard, did he  show you 
photographs? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he show you any statements? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  And you understood OJ. Simpson was  deposed in this case. 
Right? Did you know that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You know he testified under oath? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  You know he testified with respect to his alibi or alleged alibi? 
 
MR. BAKER: Vague. 
 
THE WITNESS: Who? 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q:  You understand that Mr. Simpson testified with respect to his 
alleged alibi at the time of the murders? 
 
A:  With his alleged alibi? 
 
Q:  Yeah.  Where he was at the time of the murders.  Did you know 
that he provided an explanation under oath? 
 
A: I didn't know. I didn't know that. 
 
Q: You didn't hear that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Did you know he testified with respect to the origin of the cut 
on his finger?  Did you hear  about that? 
 
A:  I thought that he had a cut from -in  Chicago. 
 
MR. KRAMER:  That's not- the question is:  Are you aware 
whether or not Mr. Simpson testified of  his version under oath 
about where he got the cut, in  his deposition in this case?  Is that 
the question? 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
 BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q:  Do you know that? A: I didn't know that. 
 
Q:  Did you hear anything that Mr. Simpson testified about from 
news accounts in connection with his deposition? A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever-Do you read the newspaper on a daily basis? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Did you have any interest in finding out  Mr. Simpson's 
explanation with respect to his alibi? 
 
A: I was just tired of it. No. 
 
Q: You didn't want anything to do with it? 
 
A: I just want to move on with my life.  That's pretty much what I 
want. 
 
Q:  As you sit here today, you have no  interest in frying to 
determine who's responsible for  Nicole's death? 
 
 MR. BAKER: Argumentative. 
 
 THE WITNESS: It's not that interest. I mean,  it would be nice to 
find the real killers, but I have a life with three kids, and I think my 
family has  suffered and my kids have suffered enough. I think  it's 
time to move on. That's all. I figure Nicole's been taken care of, 
okay, that's fine. 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q:  That what? 
 
A:  Nicole is up there already, so that's how I see things.  All I 
want to do now is take care of the kids, and I will take  
 
care of Sydney and Justin if they went me to. That's all. 
 
Q: It doesn't really matter to you if  OJ. Simpson murdered Nicole 
or not, does it? 
 
A: Of course it matters to me. I wish if you could prove it, that's 
fine. 
 
Q:  Well, you are not really interested in  the proof. 
 
A:  You know what?  It's not that.  My kids  are suffering already, 
and Sydney and Justin are suffering.  They're- everybody's 
suffering from the  whole thing. 
 
Q:  But the question- 
 
A:  They have lost their mom already. Okay? 
 
Q:  And does it matter to you why they lost  their mom or who's 
responsible for the loss of their  mother? Is that an important 
question? 
 
MR. BAKER:  Asked and answered 12 times. 
 
THE WITNESS:  Does it matter? 
 
MR. BAKER: And harassing now. 
 
 BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
A:  Of course it matters to me. 
 
Q:  And would it matter to you if  OJ. Simpson is the person that 
caused these children to be without their mother? 
 
MR. BAKER: Same objection. 
 
THE WITNESS: If it matters to me? 
 
BY MR. BREWER: 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
A:  Yes, of course it matters. 
 
Q:  And would it matter to you in terms of the safety of your own 
children, leaving them with  someone that you believe may have 
murdered Nicole  Brown Simpson? 
 
A: Of course it matters to me. 
 
Q:  In that regard, have you undertaken any  further investigation 
in the last two or three months  to determine to your satisfaction 
whether Mr. Simpson  is the person that's responsible for Nicole's 
death? 
 
A: Me? 
 
Q:  Yes. 
 
A: Getting an investigator for this? 
 
Q: No, no.  Just- 
 
A: Or trying to investigate it? 
 
 Q:  Reading a newspaper, following his deposition testimony, 
asking him questions, things of that nature. 
 
A: No. I'm just not interested because I was just tired of it. I want 
to move on. 
 
Q:  By the way, when did you hear that OJ. Simpson cut his finger 
in Chicago? 
 
A: Through the news.  The news.  You know, I heard it over the 
news.  So it was the following day  or-I don't know. During that 
week. 
 
Q:  Did you notice that week whether his  finger was bandaged 
either at the wake or the funeral? 
 
A:  Oh, I noticed at the funeral. 
 
Q:  Did you ask him about it? 
 
A:  No, I didn't talk to him about it. 
 
MR. BREWER: I don't have anything further. 
 
MR. BAKER:  Take a quick break.

EXAMINATION 
 
 BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q:  Good evening, Miss Fischman. My name is John Kelly, and I 
represent Nicole's estate. I am going to ask you...Miss Fischman, I 
think you indicated that in a conversation with Mr. Simpson, that 
he told you that you were Nicole's only true friend.  Is that correct?  
Or her best friend? 
 
A:  Who? Nicole-OJ. told me? 
 
Q:  Yes. A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And when was this conversation? 
 
A:  When I did the Barbara Walters. After I  did the Barbara 
Walters. 
 
Q:  Okay. And why did he consider you  Nicole's only true friend? 
 
A: Why? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q:  Was that because you were the only one of  Nicole's friends 
that didn't consider him guilty? 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS:  No, no.  I think what happened was I was the 
one that- I saw Nicole every day, so we assumed that-you know, 
we were best friends.  We 
 
 saw each other every day.   . 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q:  Okay.  It had nothing to do with what you had said? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Okay.  I want to go back to this incident in mid May where- 
 
A:  Mid May? 
 
Q:  Mid May of 1994, where you had Sydney and  Justin in your 
car- 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  -faking them to school, and you saw Mr. Simpson. 
 
A:  Uh-huh. 
 
Q:  Now, this was during the time when Nicole was sick, wasn't it? 
 
A:  Yes, I think so. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And you were driving the kids  every day while she was 
sick? 
 
A: Not every day. No, she was still doing  it, and then she and OJ. 
and I, the three of us were  doing it, yeah, pretty much. 
 
Q:  And do you recall whether this was after  her birthday, this 
incident? 
 
A: After her birthday? 
 
 Q: Yeah.  She was sick on her birthday. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And she was sick for a period of time after her birthday 
also. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And as best as you recall, did this incident with the 
children take place after her birthday? 
 
A: I think so, yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. And who had arranged for you to  pick up Sydney and 
Justin that morning? 
 
A: Who arranged? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: At that time I called Nicole and I 
 
Q: Okay. You offered to take them.' 
 
A: Yeah. I said, "Do you want me to take  the kids?" 
 
 She said, "Okay, fine." 
 
Q:  All right. And after you picked them up is when Nicole called 
you on the car phone? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. So they had only been in the car  for a matter of 
seconds? 
 
A: A second? 3 
 
Q:  Yeah. A:  No, not a second.  Well, yeah, could be, yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. And you pulled over immediately with Mr. Simpson 
behind you? 
 
A:  Yeah.  He told me to pull over, yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And did he get out of his car then? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Did you get out of your car? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  You just let the children out of your  car? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And after you did, did you  continue on to the school 
then? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. And when you dropped the children  off there, did you 
see Mr. Simpson there at the  school? 
 
A: Did I see Mr.-after the school? No. 
 
Q:  No. I mean when you were dropping your  kids off, did Mr. 
Simpson show up there with Sydney  and Justin? 
 
A:  Yeah, because he was in front of us. He 
 
 was in front of us, so... 
 
Q:  But what I am asking you: Do you recall seeing him at the 
school also? 
 
A:  I don't remember. 
 
Q:  Do you know as a matter- 
 
A:  I mean- 
 
Q:  Excuse me? 
 
A:  I don't remember.  I mean, I'm trying to remember, so probably 
later on 
 
Q:  I would appreciate it if you could recall whether you actually 
saw Mr. Simpson in the Bentley at  the school then. 
 
A: Well, he was-he was, what do you call,  he was in front of us. 
 
Q:  Right. 
 
A: So that was it. I didn't- 
 
Q:  Did you follow him to the school then? 
 
A:  I followed him.  I was behind him, so I  went to school. 
 
Q:  Okay.  But he didn't turn around and go back to the house with 
the kids? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  You're certain about that? 
 
A:  No, I'm not certain. I don't know. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Did you have any conversation with 
 
 Nicole later that day regarding this incident? 
 
A:  Later that day? Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. And did she say anything to you about Mr. Simpson 
coming back home with Sydney and Justin before he took them to 
school? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: He didn't say that- she didn't say that. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q:  Okay. Did she ever discuss that with you? 
 
A: I don't think so, no. 
 
Q:  And you don't know whether or not  Mr. Simpson went back to 
Bundy before he took them to  school? 
 
A:  I don't know that.  I don't know. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And you didn't see Sydney's reaction at all when she got 
out of the car to go back  to Mr. Simpson? 
 
MR. BAKER: Got into the car? 
 
MR. KELLY: To get into his car. 
 
THE WITNESS: Well, they were- they jumped  when they saw 
their dad.  They went out and they went  to the car. Justin jumped.  
He said, "That's daddy.  Let's go," so... 
 
 BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q:  Okay. 
 
A:  And I said, "Do you want me to take the kids?" So OJ. said, 
"No.  I'll take the kids." That was it. 
 
Q:  Well, how did he say that to you  outside? Were you car to car? 
 
A:  Yeah. Well, you know, we were saying- I said, "Do you want 
me to take the kids?" 
 
And he said, "No. I'll take the kids." 
 
Q:  He didn't raise his voice at you or 
 
A:  Well, we were screaming because we were out-you know, he 
says, "I want to take the kids."  So actually- then I called Nicole. I 
said, "Is OJ.  mad?" 
 
She says, "Yeah, you know, I just spoke to him." 
 
So that's it. 
 
Q:  Well, did he appear angry to you? 
 
A:  Yeah, I thought he was mad at me. 
 
Q:  What exactly did he say to you? 
 
A: What exactly? 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
A: He says, "I want my kids." 
 
 Q:  Anything else? 
 
A:  That was it. 
 
Q:  Did he appear to be angry to you also? 
 
A: See, at the time Nicole told me that he was mad at me because 
he thought that I was the one messing up the- you know, because 
of my affair. Yeah Nicole told me that OJ. was mad at me. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And you don't know anything about Mr. Simpson 
taking the kids home before they went to school? 
 
A: I didn't know that, no. 
 
Q:  Okay. And you never discussed it with  her after the fact 
either? 
 
A:  No. No. 
 
Q:  Okay. Now, you talked about the  dangerous life Nicole was 
leading near the end there.  Is that correct? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And it wasn't dangerous because she was going out drinking 
with Faye, was it? 
 
A:  They were drinking a lot, yes. Dangerous  life means, you 
know, they've had an accident. You  know, that's what I mean by 
"dangerous life." 
 
Q:  Nobody who was threatening to her that  they had met in the 
recent past? 
 
 A:  No. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And with this 1992 incident when Nicole was receiving 
threatening phone calls- 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  -you're familiar with that? 
 
A:  Uh-huh.  Yes. 
 
Q:  Nicole told you about it? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  She knew who was making the phone  calls, didn't she? 
 
A:  At that time when there was phone call,  no, she didn't know. 
 
Q:  Did she eventually find out who it was? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And do you know whether or not Nicole actually went 
over to the person's place and  confronted them? 
 
A: If I actually know? 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
A:  No, I don't know. 
 
Q:  Did anybody tell you that? 
 
A:  Nobody told me. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Do you know that after a short period of time those 
phone calls stopped coming to her? 
 
 A:  Yeah, it did stop, yes. 
 
Q:  Did she ever mention them to you again? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Do you know how many of them she received? 
 
A:  How many?  I'm sorry. 
 
Q:  Phone calls she received. 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: How many phone calls? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q:  Yeah, threatening phone calls. 
 
A:  That time that guy was threatening.  She was afraid of that guy, 
whoever the guy was calling. You're talking about 1992. Right? 
 
Q:  Right. 
 
A:  Yeah, she was scared. 
 
Q:  Okay.  But they stopped after a short  period of time, did they 
not, the phone calls? 
 
A:  Yes, because she reported that to the police report, yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And did she ever indicate to you that she ever got a 
threatening phone call again after  that? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Okay.  You said Nicole used to use "kill" 
 
as a figure of speech? A: I'm sorry.  What? 
 
Q:  She used to use the word "kill" as a figure of speech? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. She used to say like Judy would kill her or Faye would 
kill her? A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Did she ever tell you that Judy had said  she was going to kill 
her? 
 
A:  Well, no-yeah, she said that, yes. 
 
Q:  That Judy had said it to her? 
 
A:  What? 
 
Q:  That Judy had actually said to Nicole that she was going to kill 
her? 
 
A:  Oh, no, not Judy, but Nicole had told me. 
 
Q:  Okay, but- 
 
A:  Not Judy, no. Not Judy. 
 
Q:  No. And Nicole didn't tell that you Faye  had said she was 
going to kill her, did she? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Okay.  The only person that Nicole ever  told you had said that 
they were going to kill her was  Mr. Simpson, was it not? 
 
A:  Yes. Right. 
 
 Q:  Okay.  The only person you know that there was enormous 
amount of evidence against and who had said they were going to 
kill Nicole was Mr. Simpson. Isn't that true also? 
 
MR. BAKER: Vague. Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q:  Okay.  With regard to this National Enquirer lawsuit you're 
involved in, could you tell me  what is it you're looking for from 
that lawsuit? 
 
MR. BAKER: Irrelevant. Violates her privacy. 
 
THE WITNESS: What is it I'm looking for? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
MR. BAKER: Calls for a legal conclusion. 
 
 MR. KRAMER: You just want the witness' understanding. Right? 
 
 MR. KELLY: Yeah. 
 
Q:  What was your understanding of that  lawsuit? 
 
 MR. KRAMER: Don't say anything about what your  lawyers 
have said to you.  That's attorney-client  communication. 
 
THE WITNESS:  To me I was just-I guess to me I was just mad at 
all these people trying to make 
 
money off my, you know, my friend. Like, here's this lady I 
helped, and stole a picture. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Do we know what time we are starting tomorrow?  
Are you-if someone is leaving- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: 10:30. 
 
MR. KRAMER: As long as everyone has that understanding, that's 
fine.  I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. 
 
MR. BREWER: I was wasn't going to leave until I- 
 
MR. KELLY: Knew the time? 
 
Q:  I'm sorry. What is your understanding of  the lawsuit? 
 
A:  What's my understanding of the lawsuit? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A:  That I was told that nobody has a right to take any photos in 
my house. 
 
(Michael Brewer leaves the deposition.) 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q:  Okay.  But Brooke isn't the one who took  the photo from your 
house, is she? 
 
A:  I'm sorry? 
 
Q:  Brooke- 
 
A:  Brooke was what? 
 
Q:  She didn't take any photo from your house, did she? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  You don't think the National Enquirer took any photo from 
your house, do you? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  Okay.  Do you think [Name Deleted]'s the one who took it? 
 
A:  If I think? Yeah, she took the picture. 
 
Q:  Okay.  But the person or the entity that you're suing is the 
National Enquirer, is it not? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
MR. BAKER: Totally irrelevant. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q:  And that's because they published it? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  And that was the same photo that was published in Star 
Magazine? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And you received $15,000 for that Star Magazine 
article? 
 
A:  No. I actually got 13,000 out of that. 
 
Q:  13,750- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:-or just 13,000? 
 
 A:  13,000. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And that photo appeared in that article. 
 
A:  Right. 
 
Q:  Okay. And this photo wasn't a photo-you weren't in that photo 
at all, were you? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q:  It was just Nicole and OJ? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay. And would it be fair to say the value of that photo was 
because Nicole was murdered? 
 
A:  What? 
 
MR. BAKER: Vague as to- 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q:  The value of that photograph was because one of the people in 
the picture had been murdered? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And the other person was accused of the crime.  A:  
And the other person is accused of the  crime? 
 
Q:  Yeah, Mr. Simpson, in the photo. 
 
A:  That was just-that's a picture of my friends, and nobody has the 
right to take that  picture. So- 
 
Q:  Okay. A:  -yes, we said yes. 
 
Q:  Okay.  What was the purpose of your seeking to copyright that 
photograph? 
 
A:  My purpose? 
 
Q:  Yeah. 
 
MR. KRAMER: If you know. 
 
MR. BAKER:  Irrelevant.  Calls for a legal conclusion. 
 
MR. KRAMER:  And not something that your lawyers told you. 
 
THE WITNESS: Because I don't know. 
 
MR. KRAMER: If you don't know and you can't  say without what 
I told you, then that's what you  answer. 
 
 THE WITNESS: Okay, fine. So I can't answer  that. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q:  Did you intend to use that photograph at  any time in the future 
again? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:  Did you intend to use it along with any  book you intended to 
publish? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Okay.  Was that one of only two Pag 636 photographs you had 
of Nicole and OJ. at that time? 
 
A:  That was the only family picture of my-of Nicole and OJ. with 
me, yeah. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And when you spoke to people about possibly 
publishing a book, did you indicate to them that you had 
photographs that you could use? 
 
MR. BAKER:  Irrelevant. 
 
THE WITNESS: I'm sorry.  What? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q:  When you spoke to people about publishing a book- 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:-did you indicate to them that you had photographs? 
 
A:  That if I have pictures, yes. 
 
Q:  Yeah.  Okay. And one of those pictures was the one that was 
used by the National Enquirer? 
 
MR. BAKER: Irrelevant. 
 
THE WITNESS:  I showed that picture, yes. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q:  Okay. Where is-How long did [Name Deleted]  work for you., 
 
MR. BAKER: Irrelevant. 
 
THE WITNESS:  How long?  Oh, God. I don't  remember. Started 
when Nicole moved to Bundy, so January, February, you know, of 
1994. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. So how did you come in contact with [Name Deleted]? 
You met her through Nicole? 
 
A:  No. Met her through-I found [Name Deleted] for Nicole from 
other housekeepers.  I don't know.  Something like that. 
 
Q:  Okay.  And did she always have the same schedule with you, 
[Name Deleted]? 
 
MR. KRAMER:  Are you talking about at the beginning? 
 
MR. KELLY: Yeah. 
 
Q:  Well, for as long as she worked for you. 
 
A:  Well, at first she was working for me on  weekends. She 
worked five days a week with Nicole, and then on weekends with 
me. 
 
Q:  Okay. 
 
A:  And then when Nicole died, she didn't have a job, so I told her 
to work for me any-you  know, full time till she found a job.

Q: Good morning, Miss Fischman. 
 
A: Good morning. 
 
Q: Between yesterday when we finished and this morning, have 
you spoken to anybody about your testimony except for your 
attorney, Mr. Kramer? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And who was that? 
 
A: I talked to my kids.

Q: Okay.  All right.  But nothing about your testimony 
specifically? 
 
A: No, not specifically. 
 
Q: Okay.  Yesterday we had talked a little bit about an incident in 
late May where you had picked up Nicole's children one morning 
for school and Mr. Simpson had subsequently shown up, and the 
children went from your car into his.  Is that correct? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Okay.  And what street was that on again? 
 
A: We were on San Vicente Boulevard. 
 
Q: Okay.  And I believe you indicated that Mr. Simpson pulled in 
front of your car? 
 
A: No.  Behind my car. 
 
Q: Okay.  He pulled behind your car. 
 
A: Right. 
     
Q: And Sydney and Justin got out of your car and got into his? 
     
A: Right. 
  
Q: Okay.  And did he pull out in front of you then after they got 
into his car? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay.  And after he pulled out in front of you, did you proceed 
directly to the school then? 
 
A: Yes.

A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  When was the last time that morning that you saw Mr. 
Simpson and the children then? 
 
A: When was the last time? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: That was the last time.  I didn't see them after that. 
 
Q: Okay.  When you pulled up to the school, you didn't see him 
there in the Bentley? 
 
A: No.  I didn't notice. 
     
Q: Okay. In fact after he left that intersection there, you didn't see 
the car again, did you? 
 
A: No, I didn't see the car. 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  And it's your testimony that after that incident, later that 
day or at any time you never discussed it with Nicole? 
 
A: Later? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay.  You did discuss it with her. 
 
A: I did discuss it, yeah.  I called her on the phone.  I said what 
was going on. 
 
Q: And that was after the kids left the car? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q:: Okay.  And what did she tell you? 
 
A: She said that O.J. was mad. 
 
Q: Okay.  
     
A: And that O.J.'s mad at me.  I said, "Why? What did I do?"  She 
said well, he's just mad at me.  So that's what. 
 
Q: After that phone conversation did you have any other 
conversations with Nicole? 
 
A: That was it. 
 
Q: That was it? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay.  And you have no knowledge of Mr. Simpson going 
back to Bundy with the children after they got into his car? 
 
A: No. 
  
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: On June 14th, 1994, okay, this is two days after the murder 
now, do you recall where you were that day? 
 
A: What's June 14th? 
 
Q: It's Tuesday. 
 
A: Tuesday? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Tuesday. I was at home. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you recall going to Bundy at all? 
     
A: Tuesday.  Yes, I did go to Bundy. 
  
Q: Okay.  Do you recall approximately what time that was that 
you went over to Bundy, Nicole's condo? 
     
A: I went in the afternoon. 
     
Q: Okay.  And do you recall what caused you to go over there? 
     
A: Lou asked me for the key to the Bundy house. 
     
Q: Okay.  Lou had called you? 
 
A: Lou went to Rockingham. 
 
Q: To your place on Rockingham? 
 
A: Right, in the morning, and asked where Alvia was. 
  
Q: Okay.  Was Alvia there at that time? 
     
A: Yes, yes, Alvia was there, right. 
 
Q: Okay. And did Alvia talk to Lou at that point?

Q: Did she leave with Lou? 
A: She was -- Alvia was at home, at my house at Rockingham. 
 
Q: At your place. 
 
A: Yeah, at my -- at Rockingham. 
 
Q: What I am asking you is: When Lou came and spoke to her, 
did she then go with Lou back to Bundy? 
     
A: I think so, yes. 
  
Q: Okay.  And did you speak to Lou at that time? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Did you give him the keys to Bundy? 
     
A: No, I didn't give my keys to -- he asked for Alvia's keys at that 
time.

A: Yes. 
  
Q:: And did Alvia give Lou a set of keys? 
 
A: I don't know.  I think so.  I'm not sure.

Bundy residence that morning?

A: No, I didn't let him in.

stuff out. 
     
Q: Who had asked you to take the stuff out?

A: Yes, he was there already. 
  
Q: And what, if anything, was A.C. doing when you got there? 
     
A: We were putting all of Nicole's belongings to the car.  That

A: Yeah, I went upstairs and put everything in bags. 
     
Q: And did you have any conversations with A.C. that day?

Q: Okay. Did you go there on the 17th?  
 
A: What's the 17th? You have to give me -- 
     
Q: That was the day after the funeral, the day of the Bronco chase. 
     
A: Yes, I went back, yes. 
     
Q: Okay. And did someone call you to come over? 
     
A: I was so confused that day.  I think Lou. 
     
Q: I'm sorry. I'll come back to the 17th.  On the 14th was there a 
time that Simpson called the Bundy residence when you were 
there? 
     
MR. KRAMER: This is the Tuesday when they were packing? 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: Yeah, Tuesday on the 14th, when you were packing. 
     
A: I don't know, you know, because I was upstairs in the 
bedroom, so... 
     
Q: Okay.  Was Ron Hardy there that day? 
 
A: Yes, he was there. 
 
Q: He was. 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Did you see him on the telephone at all? 
     
A: I was upstairs, so I wouldn't know, so... 
     
Q: Okay.  And as far as you know, Ron Fischman wasn't there at 
all on the 14th? 
     
A: Ron wasn't there, no. 
     
W: Okay.  Was he there on the 17th at all? 
 
A: 17th? 
 
Q: Yeah, the day after the funeral, was he at Bundy? 
     
A: Yeah, he followed me, yes, yeah. 
 
Q: Did you and he discuss him coming over to Bundy or if he 
would come over there? 
     
A: At the time, no, I don't think so.  I just heard over the news that 
someone was at Bundy, and then when I -- Lou called, or I must 
have spoken to someone at the time.  He said that there was 
another 911 or Lou called 911.  So I panicked.  I said, "Oh, my 
God, something happened again." And  that was -- you know, like 
I got scared.  I said, "Another one?"  So my instinct was just to go 
there again and find out. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did you have any discussions with your husband before 
you went over there? 
     
A: I don't remember. I mean, it was like -- the whole thing was -- 
to me was -- I was very confused and... 
 
Q: Did you have any discussions between the 14th and the 17th 
with your husband about who might be responsible for Nicole's 
murder? 
       
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
     
THE WITNESS: At that time? 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: We talked, but it was hush-hush.  We were like we didn't 
know.  It was like we were afraid to talk because we were afraid 
who really did it, afraid that we might get hurt. 
     
Q: Well, who did he tell you he thought did it? 
     
A: At that time our first initial reaction was he did it, you know. 
     
Q: Simpson did it? 
 
A: That's what we thought. 
    
Q: Okay.  That was your husband's reaction, too? 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
     
THE WITNESS: At that time, yes. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: Okay. Did your husband have another theory also in the days 
following the murder as to who might have committed it? 
     
A: I don't know. 
     
Q: He didn't talk to you about anybody other than Simpson being 
the possible murderer? 
  
A: No. 
     
Q: Did he relate to you any conversations he had had with A.C.? 
       
A: I don't know about that. 
     
Q: Okay. Did you have any conversations after the 14th with 
A.C., either at the wake or funeral? 
     
MR. KRAMER: The 14th is the Tuesday? 
     
MR. KELLY: Yeah. 
     
THE WITNESS: Yeah. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q:: Okay. And did you speak to him at the wake? 
     
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you speak to him at the funeral? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: When did you next speak to him? 
       
A: You mean to A.C.  Right? 
     
Q: Yeah. 
     
A: That walk that I did with him on San Vicente. 
     
Q: Okay. And that was later in June after -- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And he had called you? 
       
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay. And what had he said to you when he called you? 
     
A: He said -- he asked how I was and how I'm doing, and he said, 
"Would you like to talk?"  I said yes, you know, and that was it.  
So he said, "We'll meet at a coffee shop."  
 
Q: Okay.  And how long did you talk to him for? 
     
A: I would say less than half an hour.  15, 20 minutes.  We walked 
down San Vicente. 
     
Q: And did A.C. indicate to you that he had spoken to Simpson at 
all prior to your meeting? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Okay. Did he tell you anything that Simpson had said to him 
about the murders? 
     
A: He didn't say anything about that. 
 
Q: Okay.  He didn't talk to you at all about who might have 
committed the murders other than Simpson? 
     
A: No, he didn't say anything. 
     
Q: Did he in any way indicate to you that he thought Simpson had 
committed the murders? 
     
A: At that time --  
     
MR. BAKER: I think this has been asked and answered. 
     
THE WITNESS: I don't remember anymore, no. 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Nothing? 
     
A: I don't think so, no. 
     
Q: Did he talk about Nicole's relationship with Simpson at all? 
     
A: Yeah, we talked about that, yeah. 
     
Q: Okay.  Do you recall what he said? 
       
A: He said they had a very passionate relationship, that Nicole 
was a very devoted wife. 
     
Q: And what did he say about Simpson? 
     
A: And that both of them just -- were just -- they loved each other. 
     
Q: Okay.  Did he indicate that there was a problem also or -- 
     
A: Oh, yeah, he mentioned about O.J.'s womanizing. 
     
Q: Okay. Anything else? 
       
A: That was it. 
     
Q: Did he mention 1989 at all, the New Year's Day incident? 
     
A: No, he didn't mention that, no. 
     
Q: Okay.  And after that conversation with A.C., have you spoken 
to him since at all about this? 
     
A: I'm sorry.  Did I talk to who? 
     
Q: A.C. at all after this one conversation this day. 
     
MR. KRAMER: You're asking any conversation -- 
     
MR. KELLY: Any time. 
 
MR.KRAMER: -- in the last two years? 
     
MR. KELLY: Any time. 
     
THE WITNESS: Well, he was at the house at Rockingham when I 
picked up the kids one time. I said hello, and he asked me how I 
was doing.  That was it.  And I asked him -- he said he's working.  
I said, "Oh, that's good."  That's pretty much -- 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: Okay.  You didn't discuss the case at all? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Simpson? 
       
A: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Now, I want to ask you about the incident at Tryst, the 
restaurant. 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay.  You were there that night. 
       
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay.  And you were at a table with a number of other people? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: And who else was there, if you recall? 
     
A: Cynthia was there. 
     
Q: Okay. 
     
A: [Name Deleted].  [Name Deleted].  One guy that Nicole was 
trying to set up with Cici, so I forgot the name. 
     
Q: Was Keith there also or... 
     
A: Keith was there, but he didn't sit with us. You know, he was 
just there. 
     
Q: Okay. And did there come a time that Simpson showed up 
there? 
     
A: Yeah.  We were waiting for a table.  Then he showed up, so... 
     
Q: And did you eventually get a table? 
     
A: We waited -- we waited quite a bit. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did there come a time that night that you left before the 
others? 
       
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
     
THE WITNESS: We left? What do you mean? 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: That you left before the other people -- 
       
A: With Nicole? 
 
Q: -- you were with. 
       
A: No.  We ate dinner there, so 
 
Q: And who had you gone there with? 
 
A: Who did I go? 
     
Q: No.  Who had you gone to the restaurant with? 
     
A: I went with Nicole -- actually, no.  I went myself.  We went 
separate cars. 
       
Q: Okay. 
 
A: She was with [Name Deleted]at the time. 
 
Q: Okay. And you arrived there yourself in your own car? 
     
A: Yes.  Yes. 
     
Q: And did you leave by yourself? 
       
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Did you leave before the check had come, or everybody left at 
the same time? 
 
A: We pretty much left at the same time. 
     
Q: You didn't leave before the others? 
     
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Miss Fischman, did you leave before the others? 
     
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. 
     
THE WITNESS: Nicole and [Name Deleted]were there while -- 
we pretty much left the same time. 
       
BY MR. KELLY: 
       
Q: Okay.  You didn't express any discomfort about being there 
and left before dinner was finished? 
 
A: Oh, no. We finished dinner and everything.  We ate, and then, 
you know, finished -- we ate and then we left, and that was it. 
     
Q: Okay. 
     
MR. KRAMER: Just do the best you can. 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
Q: Do the best you can. 
      
MR. KRAMER: Do the best you can. 
      
THE WITNESS: Exactly, but you're trying to say what -- 
       
MR. KRAMER: No, don't analyze it.  Just listen -- 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Don't wonder what I'm asking.  Okay? 
 
A: Okay. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Just think about it -- 
      
THE WITNESS: I am. 
 
MR. KRAMER: -- and answer to the best of your ability. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. By the way, did you ever know Nicole to be dishonest? 
 
A: I'm being dishonest? 
 
Q: No. Did you ever know Nicole to be dishonest in any way? 
 
MR.BAKER: Asked and answered four times in three days. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Could you give me a specific instance or... 
 
A: Well, when she told me not to tell O.J. what she was doing. 
 
Q: Okay.  Other than that? 
 
A: That's being dishonest. 
      
Q: Other than that? 
     
A: Pretty much that's it. 
     
Q: Anything she told you that you later found out to not be true? 
     
A: No.  That's pretty much, you know... 
     
Q: Did she ever exaggerate things? 
       
A: Exaggerate things? 
 
Q:: Yeah. 
       
A: No, I wouldn't consider that, no. 
     
Q: Okay. She wasn't overly dramatic, like Faye? 
     
A: No, not at all.  She was a real person. 
 
Q: Okay.  She didn't make things up, did she? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  This statement that Nicole told you Simpson had made 
to her about "If I ever catch you with another man, I'll kill you," 
we had this discussion before with the other attorneys, too, and 
you indicated that was sometime in 1993? 
 
A: Yeah, right.  Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you remember what month that was? 
 
A: When they tried to reconcile, so '93, March, April, around that 
time. 
 
Q: Okay.  So it was at the time they were reconciling, though.  Is 
that correct? 
 
A: Right, that was-that week that they were trying to reconcile, 
when they went out to dinner. 
 
Q: And Nicole, I believe you indicated she had already had her 
affair with Marcus? 
 
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay. And to the best of your knowledge, after Mr. Simpson 
had made this statement to her, she didn't date anybody else for 
that next year or so, did she, Nicole, other than Simpson? 
  
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. 
 
THE WITNESS: You mean Nicole?  No, she didn't date. 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: And to the best of your knowledge, even in April and May of 
1994 now-this is still during the reconciliation -- Simpson did not 
know Nicole was seeing anybody else, did he? 
     
A: Simpson did not know? Yes. 
     
Q: Yes, he did not know? 
     
A: I don't know.  I don't know. 
     
Q: Okay. You never discussed it with him. 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Okay. You never discussed with Mr. Simpson this guy [Name 
Deleted]from Cabo, did you? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Or this guy [Name Deleted]? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: No.  Okay.  Or Marcus Allen at all. 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Okay.  But you talked to him a lot, didn't you? 
     
A: Yes.  Not -- yeah, right, I would say. 
     
Q: Okay.  And he would talk about Nicole a lot with you also. 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: And as far as you knew, though, during the course of these 
conversations, he never indicated that he knew Nicole had started 
seeing anybody else again. 
     
A: That I don't know, no. 
     
Q: But to the best of your knowledge. 
     
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
     
THE WITNESS: As far as I know, yeah, I don't know. 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: Okay.  And even into June of 1994, Mr. Simpson never 
indicated that he knew that Nicole was seeing anybody else. 
     
MR. KRAMER: Never said anything to Cora? 
     
MR. KELLY: Yeah, indicated to her, told her. 
 
MR. KRAMER: Do you understand the question?  Do you have it 
-- Could you either have it read back or reask it, because -- 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
  
Q: Okay.  Even in June of 1994, up to that time had Simpson ever 
told you or spoken to you about Nicole seeing anybody else -- 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: -- since their reconciliation? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. So as far as you know, even up to the day of the 
murders, June 12th, 1994, Simpson did not know of Nicole seeing 
any other person since her reconciliation. 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay.  Now, you had also indicated that you had a lot of long 
talks with Mr. Simpson in the two years prior to Nicole's death.  Is 
that right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And would it be fair to say there were different, I guess, 
phases of their relationship that past two years, meaning January 
to June of 1992 when they were going through the divorce? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay. Then there was a period after the divorce and before 
their reconciliation? 
 
A: Yes. 
  
Q: Then the reconciliation.  Now, did you receive a large number 
of phone calls from Mr. Simpson during that January to June 
period of 1992? 
     
MR. BAKER: Vague. 
     
THE WITNESS: January to June? 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: Yeah, right- 
     
A: What do you mean by a large phone call? 
     
Q: Well, did you get steady phone calls from Mr. Simpson?     . 
     
A: It wasn't steady. I mean, once every two weeks, something like 
that.  It wasn't all the time, no.  He didn't call every day. Is that 
what you --  
     
Q: Would he call more than once a week? 
     
A: No.  It was just once a week or something like that.  It wasn't a 
lot.  I wasn't really that close to him.  I was more close to Nicole. 
     
Q: Okay. Do you recall what you would speak to him about when 
he would call? 
     
A: It was always we talked about pretty much the problem with 
Nicole. 
     
Q: Okay. Did he ever ask you where Nicole was at any given 
time? 
     
A: Where Nicole was? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
     
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
     
THE WITNESS: No.  Pretty much asked -- he asked how Nicole 
was, what is she doing. Yes, what is she doing, you know. 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Did he ever call you late at night? 
       
A: Late at night? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: No.  Not late at night, no.  Not late at night.  I don't think that 
ever happened. 
     
Q: Okay.  Would he call you at all during the reconciliation 
period? 
     
MR. BAKER: You're talking '93? 
       
THE WITNESS: June of --  
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: '93 -- 
 
A: Yes. 
     
Q: -- into April-May '94. 
       
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay.  What would be the purpose of those phone calls? 
     
A: About Nicole, about kids, you know. 
     
Q: Okay. You said he would call you when he had a problem with 
Nicole? 
       
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
     
THE WITNESS: Problems with Nicole? 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: Yeah. 
     
MR. BAKER: Vague. 
     
THE WITNESS: Yes, pretty much, yeah. 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: Could you tell me what some of those problems were that he 
called you about? 
 
A: What Nicole is up to.  That's pretty much, you know... 
 
Q: This was during the reconciliation period. 
 
A: Oh, during the reconciliation. 
     
Q: Yeah. 
     
MR. KRAMER: Could you give her again the time frame? 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: Yeah.  April of 1993 up through May of 1994. 
     
A: You know, there was a period where O.J. was not calling me, 
because they were going out a lot. 
     
Q: Right.  That would have been during the reconciliation -- 
     
A: Yes. 
       
Q: -- period? 
 
A: Yes. 
     
Q: And moving up to May of 1994 now, this last month --  
     
A: Yeah. 
     
Q:-do you recall him calling you at all during that period? 
     
A: The last time I spoke to him about the relationship was that 
walk that we did, and then we went to -- you know, when I asked 
him, "I want to talk to you," that was the last one. 
     
Q: That was when you went to his office then? 
     
A: Yes, we walked and then went to his office. 
     
Q: Okay. You don't know what that date was, do you? 
     
A: April, May. 
  
Q: Let me ask you: Do you remember Christian Reichardt's party? 
     
A: That's April 30. 
     
Q: 30th. Okay. It was after that.  Right? 
     
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
       
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: He was in Puerto Rico before that, wasn't he, Simpson? 
 
A: Was he in Puerto Rico the whole April, May?  Could have 
been May. 
 
Q: Okay.  What about, do your remember Mother's Day clearly? 
Was it after Mother's Day? 
     
A: Yes, what about Mother's Day? 
       
Q: When you took -- I am trying to -- 
 
A: Yeah, because she had pneumonia on her birthday, which is 
the 19th.  You know, it's gotta be I talked to her -- I talked to him 
around April, then, when he got back from Puerto Rico. 
 
Q: And was this before Nicole's birthday and when she got sick? 
     
A: Oh, yes, yes, before. Before that. 
 
Q: Okay. 
     
A: Before the incident in the car where the kids were picked up, 
yeah, definitely. 
     
Q: And this was before she gave the bracelet back? 
 
A: Before she gave the bracelet? Yes. 
     
Q: Okay. So it was probably early May? 
       
A: I'm not sure.  Early May or late April, you know, around that 
time frame. 
     
Q: Okay.  But you can't mark it relative to Christian Reichardt's 
party?  You don't know whether it was before that or after that? 
     
A: I can't, no. 
     
Q: Okay. Could you tell me, how long did you speak when you 
went for the walk? 
     
A: How long? 
     
Q: Yeah.  Was it 10 minutes? 20 minutes? 
     
A: I would say half an hour, something like that. 
     
Q: And did he do most of the talking? 
       
A: Yes.  Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  And what were his concerns at that time? 
     
A: That-well, you know, I told him that "You have one last 
chance to save your marriage," you know.  "Why don't you move 
to Florida." And at that time I was trying to convince him, you 
know, to just do something.  "Nicole loves you. She really 
ultimately wants to go back." 
     
And so at the time he was saying, you know, "We gotta" -- he was 
just confused.  He didn't know.  He says, "What does she want?"  
You know, "I'm with Paula now." 
     
I mean, that's pretty much the kind of conversation.  You know, 
he's upset.  He's angry, because he says, you know, "Nicole has to 
have a sense of commitment here.  If she wants to commit, she 
commits." That's pretty much the conversation. 
     
Q: So when you took this walk with him, was it your 
understanding he had gone back to Paula again? 
     
A: No.  I was trying to save the marriage.  That's pretty much 
what I was trying to do. 
 
Q: Okay. Did he indicate he was thinking of going back to Paula 
or... 
       
A: At that time I don't know.  I mean, I was trying to save the 
marriage. 
     
Q: Okay. He indicated he wanted to save the marriage, didn't he? 
     
A: Well, he would like to, of course, for Sydney and Justin's sake. 
     
Q: And did he indicate what Nicole's feeling was towards getting 
back together at that time? 
     
A: Well, he said he doesn't know what Nicole wanted. 
     
Q: Is that what he was asking you about or... 
     
A: Yes, pretty much. 
      
Q: And what were you telling him? 
     
A: Well, I said, you know, "Nicole's going through something, 
and just give her some time." 
       
Q: Okay.  When you say Nicole was "going through something," 
had her sort of demeanor or attitude changed at all in these last 
couple months?  I'm talking about April and May of 1994. 
     
A: Well, she told me -- she said she wanted to have fun. 
     
Q: And did she look like she was having fun to you those last 
couple months? 
     
A: Well, I mean, fun is going out and stuff like that. 
     
Q: Well, did she seem happy with her life? 
     
A: You know what? The outward she seemed, but I think inside, 
not really. 
 
Q: Well, did she tell you that? 
     
A: Well, she was confused.  She didn't know what she wanted. 
     
Q: Did you discuss that with her, though? 
     
A: Yes, we did. 
     
Q: Okay.  And she indicated she was confused? 
     
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Did she also indicate she didn't want to move back with 
Simpson at that time? 
     
A: She didn't want at the time, but she said, "Ultimately we'll be 
together." 
     
Q: Do you recall when she said that? 
 
A: Well, I can't recall, but that's kinda like what we talked about at 
the time. 
 
Q: Where? In May of 1994? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: In May of '94 did Mr. Simpson indicate to you that he was ever 
going to break up with Nicole, leave her? 
     
A: He -- I never talked to him at that time anymore, so I don't 
know. 
     
Q: You never talked to him again after that walk and that day in 
the office? 
     
A: I think that was the last time. 
     
MR. KRAMER: You are talking about during that period of time? 
     
MR. KELLY: Yeah. 
     
THE WITNESS: I think that was the last time, yes. 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: You saw Nicole a lot during that month of May 1994 -- 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: -- didn't you? 
       
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Did she ever indicate to you that she was going to leave 
Simpson? 
     
A: She -- yeah, she said that she was thinking about it. 
 
Q: Okay. Did there ever come a time -- I mean, you saw her every 
day, didn't you? 
     
A: Yeah. She said that she was not ready to go back.  She decided 
that she was just gonna do whatever she has to do first. 
     
Q: Okay.  And did she tell you she had told Simpson she wasn't 
going to continue their relationship at that time? 
     
A: Yes. I think it was after the letter. 
 
Q: The IRS letter? 
     
A: The IRS letter, right. 
     
Q: Okay.  Well, what she -- did she attach any significance to the 
returning of the bracelet, the bracelet she gave back to Simpson? 
 
A: Well, she told me -- 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: -- she felt guilty. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay. But did she say it was part of ending it with him, in 
terms of giving back that bracelet? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
     
THE WITNESS: Well, she said it wasn't hers.  It's not -- unlike 
her.  She said, "Where will I use this?" 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: Okay. But she also indicated he was trying to buy her with it, 
didn't he -- didn't she? 
     
MR. BAKER: Very leading. 
     
THE WITNESS: At the time she felt that way, too, yes. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: Yeah.  And she didn't want to be bought by him. 
     
A: Well, this is what we were talking about, like, you know, Cici 
and I says, "Well, you mean to tell me he's trying to buy you?" 
you know. 
     
Q: And she said yes. Right? 
     
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
     
THE WITNESS: At that time that's what she thought, yes. 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: This was a specific conversation you had with Cici there also? 
     
A: With Cici.  Yeah, I think Cici. 
     
Q: And this was at Starbucks? 
     
A: Could be Starbucks.  Could be one of our runs.  I mean, I don't 
know.  I don't remember. 
     
Q: What I am trying to ask you, Miss Fischman: Was there a 
particular time that Nicole indicated to you that she had ended it 
with Mr. Simpson prior to the IRS letter? 
 
A: I don't know the specific time, but she was thinking about it 
because she was even thinking of moving to Redondo Beach and 
renting.  So, you know, she was -- 
     
Q: She was looking at places, wasn't she? 
     
A: Yes, she was looking for a place. 
     
Q: She had a real estate broker? 
     
A: Yeah. 
     
Q: Okay.  And this was before the IRS -- 
       
MR. PETROCELLI: She didn't answer the question. 
     
MR. KELLY: I'm sorry? 
     
MR. PETROCELLI: She had a real estate broker and the answer 
was yes.  She went like this (Indicating), Mr. Kelly. 
     
MR. KELLY: Thank you, Mr. Petrocelli. 
     
MR. PETROCELLI: You must pay attention, Mr. Kelly. 
     
MR. KELLY: I like you covering my back, Mr. Petrocelli. 
     
MR.BAKER: That was beautiful teamwork. 
     
MR. PETROCELLI: Let the record reflect laughter. 
     
MR. KRAMER: The smile's not on everyone's faces, but actually 
I don't care, but not everyone's laughing. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: You didn't look at any places with Nicole, did you, during that 
time period? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Did she tell you why she was looking at other places, other 
than staying at Bundy? 
     
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Well, she said -- first she said she wanted to -- 
oh, she started looking after she got the IRS letter because she 
wanted to lease that place on Bundy and then rent a place like 
down at the beach in the summer with the kids. 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: Okay. Well, she had gotten that letter that last week before her 
murder, hadn't she? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
     
THE WITNESS: I don't even know when that -- yeah, I don't 
know when that letter came. Must be --  
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: It was June 6th, if that -- 
     
A: It was June 6? 
     
Q: Yeah. Monday. 
     
MR. BAKER: Just because Mr. Kelly says it doesn't make it true. 
     
MR.PETROCELLI: But what does make it true is the date on the 
letter. 
     
MR. BAKER: Well, the best evidence is the letter. 
     
THE WITNESS: I never saw that letter, so I -- you know, she just 
told me about that. 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: Okay. Were you there when it came? 
     
A: No, I wasn't there. 
     
Q: Were you there the day she received it? 
     
A: No, I wasn't there. 
     
Q: Did you see her the day after she received it? 
     
A: Yes, I saw her. 
 
Q: Could you describe her mood to me? 
     
A: Oh, no, she called me when she got that letter. 
 
Q: Okay. What did she say to you? 
     
A: She told me that "I got a letter from O.J." 
     
Q: Okay. And was she pleased with it? 
     
A: No. She said that "This is the guy" -- "This is the" -- something 
like to the effect that "He wants me to go to jail," something like 
that. 
     
Q: Okay.  Now, you are speaking very calmly, Miss Fischman.  
Was that the way Nicole was when she called you? 
     
A: You know what? 'Cause I'm tired. 
     
Q: Okay. 
     
A: I'm just telling you.  But do you want me to express? 
     
Q: I want you to tell me exactly what she said and how she said it. 
     
MR. BAKER: Oh, you didn't ask her for that. 
     
THE WITNESS: I'm tired. 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: I know you are, but -- you've done a lot of work here the last 
couple days, but if you can think about this for a second and tell 
me exactly what she said and how she said it when she called you, 
that would be great. 
     
A: That's exactly what I'm -- in a calmly way. 
     
Q: Okay.  Could you tell me again now exactly what she said, 
Nicole, when she called. 
     
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. 
     
THE WITNESS: I'm trying to remember. Pretty much that's the 
gist of it. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q Okay. Was she upset? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Did she use any vulgarity when she spoke to you? 
     
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Was her voice raised at all? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay.  Would it be fair to say she was yelling about it? 
     
A: Yeah, she didn't like the fact that -- she says, you know, "That's 
the last money I have," you know, because she had like 90,000 or 
something; she has to pay 90,000. 
     
Q: Okay. Was she angry about the letter? 
     
A: She -- yes.  Yes. 
     
Q: Okay. And did she indicate she was very angry at Simpson for 
sending the letter? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: And did she express concern about the kids also because of the 
letter? 
     
A: Well, she was afraid she was gonna go to jail. 
     
Q: Okay.  And did she -- other than that, did she express any other 
concerns? 
     
A: That was... 
     
Q: When she said she was afraid of going to jail, is that what 
Nicole said to you? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay.  And how long was this conversation with her? 
     
A: That was it.  It was a short conversation.  She just expressed 
her anger, and that's it. 
     
Q: She was definitely angry, though? 
       
A: I said, "Oh, okay." 
     
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: But my question is: She was definitely angry when she called 
you? 
     
A: Well, she was very upset, yes. 
     
Q: Okay. And you knew Nicole very well.  Right? 
     
A: Pretty much, yes. 
     
Q: Was this probably one of the more upset times you had spoken 
to her? 
     
MR. BAKER: Vague. 
     
THE WITNESS: I think she was surprised, yeah, she was, yeah. 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: More angry than other times? 
 
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
     
THE WITNESS: More angry than other times? 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: Well, was it about the most angry you had seen her at Mr. 
Simpson? 
 
MR. BAKER: I thought it was a telephone call, yes. 
     
THE WITNESS: That's pretty much, yeah, she was angry. 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: Okay. And did she tell you when she had received the letter 
relative to the phone call she made to you? 
     
A: I'm sorry.  Could you please repeat the question, please. 
     
Q: Okay.  Nicole had gotten this letter from Simpson delivered to 
her.  Correct? 
     
A: Right. 
     
Q: Did she tell you how it was delivered? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Okay.  Did she tell you when the letter had come? 
     
A: No. 
     
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. 
       
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: Okay.  Did she indicate to you she had just received the letter 
when she called you? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Okay. Did she tell you she had received it that day? 
     
A: She just said, "I just got a letter," so... 
     
Q: Okay. Did she read it to you, by the way? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Prior to that phone call, had she ever mentioned anything to 
you about Simpson making threats about the IRS to her? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Never discussed that with you? 
       
MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me. 
 
MR.BAKER: Don't look at Mr. Petrocelli if he wants to change 
your answers. You are just here to testify honestly. 
     
Let the record reflect that plaintiffs' counsel are engaged in a 
summit meeting. 
     
MR. KELLY: Now you're excited. 
       
Q: Prior to this phone call -- 
     
A: Which phone call? 
     
Q: Nicole's phone call to you. 
       
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay.  -about the IRS leader -- letter, was there a time a few 
days earlier she had called you after she had spoken to Mr. 
Simpson also? 
     
MR. BAKER: Leading. Asked and answered. 
     
THE WITNESS: I don't remember. 
       
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: You don't remember her calling and saying that she had hung 
up on Simpson and they had had a fight? 
     
MR. BAKER: Very leading. 
     
THE WITNESS: I don't remember that.  I don't remember that 
incident, no. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: Okay.  During these last two weeks before Nicole's death -- 
     
A: Okay. 
     
Q: Okay?  -- did you speak to Nicole every day? 
     
A: Did I speak to Nicole every day? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
     
A: Pretty much, yes. 
     
Q: Did you talk to her about Simpson every day? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay.  Did she ever indicate to you that she had spoken to him 
at anytime the last two weeks? 
 
A: Yes.  Yeah. 
     
Q: Okay. Do you recall what those conversations were? 
     
A: Well, pretty much she was saying that -- she says, you know, 
"My mom told me that" -- "Mom had told me that O.J.'s gonna 
give me a hard time, meaning financially. 
     
Q: Okay.  About what? 
     
A: I guess financially.  Money. 
     
Q: I know, but why would he be giving her a hard time? Over 
what? 
     
MR. BAKER: Speculation.  Vague. 
 
THE WITNESS: Because they were ending the relationship. 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: And it was your understanding that she was ending it with him.  
Is that correct? 
     
A: I thought it -- yeah, pretty much, yes. 
     
Q: Okay.  And she wanted to leave him, and he didn't want her to 
leave him.  Is that correct also? 
     
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
     
THE WITNESS: I thought so. 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: That was your impression. 
     
A: Right, because I talk -- I never talked to O.J., so I was only 
talking to Nicole, yes. 
     
Q: Okay.  But based on your conversations with Nicole, it was 
your understanding that Nicole was leaving Simpson and that he 
did not want Nicole to leave him.  Correct? 
     
A: Oh, you mean O.J. not wanting to leave Nicole? 
     
Q: O.J. didn't want Nicole to leave him. 
     
MR. BAKER: Speculation.  Vague. 
     
THE WITNESS: They were pretty much burnt out with each other 
at that time. 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: In what sense? 
     
A: At the time Nicole told me that O.J. was going out with Paula. 
     
Q: But other than just telling you that, didn't there ever come a 
time Nicole said, "It's through between us.  I'm not seeing him 
anymore"? 
 
A: Yeah, yeah, because, you know, she said to me, "If Paula's still 
around, you know, it's still the same. There's another woman," and 
she will not take that. 
     
Q: And Nicole told you this? 
     
A: Yeah. 
     
Q: Okay.  Did Nicole tell you she had told this to Simpson also? 
     
A: I don't know about that. 
     
Q: Okay.  By the way, you said before that it was your 
understanding that Nicole finally ended it when she received the 
IRS letter. 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay.  Is that something she told you as part of the phone call? 
     
A: No. No. She was just -- she was just expressing her anger, her 
disappointment. 
     
Q: With that phone call. 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay.  And other than the fact she said, "He's trying to send 
me to jail," you don't remember anything else she said to you? 
 
A: Actually that's what she said: "That   guy's trying to send me to 
jail," you know. 
     
Q: Okay.  How long was Nicole sick with double pneumonia?  Do 
you remember approximately how long that was? 
     
A: Oh, she was actually -- she couldn't run for a week, so we ran 
and then it got worse, her coughing got worse, and that was it.  
She was... 
     
Q: Okay.  And I believe you indicated you had never seen 
Simpson over at the house during that week she was sick? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Okay.  Did you talk to her everyday? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay. Did she ever indicate to you that Simpson had been over 
to the house that week while she was sick? 
     
A: Not really, no. I mean, she mentioned about the flowers and 
the chicken soup, you know.  Chicken soup, yeah. 
     
Q: That was just one day, wasn't it? 
     
A: I don't remember.  No, I don't remember. 
 
Q: Okay.  Do you know who was up there taking care of Nicole, if 
anybody was? 
 
A: Alvia was there. 
     
Q: Okay. Do you know whether her mom was up there at all? 
     
A: No, I don't think so. I don't know. 
 
Q: Okay.  Your kids would usually -- I mean, you said they spent 
an awful lot of time with the Simpson kids, didn't they? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay. And when you would take your daughter, your 12-year-
old daughter, 11-year-old daughter, somewhere, to an amusement 
park or something, would she usually take Sydney with her also? 
       
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay. Or if Sydney was going somewhere, would she usually 
take your daughter with her, too? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Was that always the case? 
 
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Inseparable. 
      
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay. 
     
A: The four of them were inseparable. 
     
Q: Okay. As of June 12th, 1994, do you know whether your 
daughter had any plans of going anywhere with Sydney? 
     
A: What's June 12? 
     
Q: That was the day of the murders. 
       
A: No, we didn't have any plans, no. 
       
Q: Okay. There was no discussion of your kids and the Simpson 
kids -- 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: -- in the near future going anywhere? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Okay.  All right.  Do you keep a calendar book, by the way? 
     
A: No. 
 
Q: Ever keep a calendar book? 
      
A: I used to. 
     
Q: In '94 did you keep a calendar book? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Okay. With the recital, we're talking June 12th now, how long 
was that entire recital from start to finish? 
     
A: It was an hour.  Oh, you mean from when we sat there till -- 
     
Q: Yeah, till the bitter end. 
       
A: Oh, my God, till... 
     
Q: It wasn't as long as the deposition, was it? 
     
A: It seemed that -- I think it was -- 
 
Q: It was a long one, wasn't it?  Weren't there 30 -- some acts?  Do 
you recall? 
     
A: Oh, yeah, and it so happened that the -- 
 
MR. BAKER: I think this is leading. 
     
MR. KELLY: It's not.  I'm refreshing her memory. 
     
THE WITNESS: I think she was the last act. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: Could you approximate the length of time you were at the 
recital from the time you arrived there till the time you left? 
     
A: Two hours. 
     
Q: Do you recall how long after you arrived there that Mr. 
Simpson arrived there? 
     
A: He arrived in middle of the program, so I would say an hour. 
     
Q: And you indicated that he sat near Nicole? 
       
A: Yes. The same row with Nicole. 
     
Q: And how many seats were empty between them? 
     
       
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. 
     
THE WITNESS: About three, three seats. 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: And were you sitting in front of them or behind them? 
     
A: I was sitting in front of them. No.  I was -- they were behind 
me, yeah, in front of them. 
     
Q: Okay. Did you turn around to talk to Nicole at all during the 
recital? 
     
A: About any specific? 
 
Q: Just in general. 
 
A: Yeah, we did, yes. 
     
Q: Okay. And were your kids back with the Simpson kids in 
between? 
     
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you ever during that hour period or more ever see 
O.J. Simpson talk to Nicole Simpson? 
     
A: No. 
    
Q: Did you ever see them looking at each other, even? 
     
A: I was behind them, so -- 
 
Q: You were in front of them. 
 
A: Yeah, I was in front of them, right. 
 
Q: Okay.  There was an intermission during this recital, wasn't 
there? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay.  Do you recall seeing either Mr. Simpson or Nicole 
standing up during the intermission? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: They both stayed in their seats? 
     
A: See, O.J. left sometime during the program, and then when he 
got back, he was sitting at the corner and he was holding flowers. 
     
Q: So how long was he there before he left? 
     
A: How long? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
     
A: I don't know. I mean, I wasn't paying attention. 
     
Q: Okay.  When you say he was seated in a "corner," he was by 
himself, wasn't he? 
     
A: Yes. Because the kids were all in back already, the whole -- at 
the time. 
     
Q: Okay.  And he grabbed the second -- separate chair and was 
seated in the corner of the gym? 
     
A: Right, yes. 
     
Q: Okay.  And how long was he seated there for? 
     
A: How long? 
     
Q: Yeah. 
     
A: I don't remember.  I don't know. 
     
Q: Okay. Well, the last act -- 
     
A: 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes. 
     
Q: Well, the last act was your daughter and Sydney, was it not? 
     
A: I would say 10 minutes. 
     
Q: Yeah.  The last act had your daughter and Sydney in it? 
     
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. And at that point he was seated back in the corner on the 
separate chair? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay. And was that the only act that Sydney was in during the 
recital, was the last act? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: So when Sydney performed, Mr. Simpson was sitting in the 
back of the auditorium in a separate chair, and Nicole was in her 
regular seat that she had been in for the whole recital.  Is that 
correct also? 
     
A: At that time we were all standing up. We were all excited, so I 
didn't even notice that.  Because we were all standing up because 
we were so excited about the program, so I don't know.  It was -- 
the whole thing was like -- 
     
Q: Okay. Well, did- 
     
A: I don't remember. I don't remember. 
     
Q: Do you remember where Simpson was at that time? 
     
A: Well, the last time I saw him, he was at the corner, so that was 
the last time I saw him. 
     
Q: You didn't see him move up again, did you? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Okay. And the last time you saw Nicole, she was still in that 
row of seats where the kids were also? 
     
A: They were all together already because we were all standing 
up.  We were all -- 
     
Q: Including Nicole. 
       
A: Yeah.  Yes.  Yes. 
     
Q: And Mr. Simpson was separate from all of you. 
 
A: He was not with us, yes. 
     
Q: And that's all I'm asking. He was separate, back in the corner. 
     
A: Exactly, right. 
     
Q: And you and Nicole and the Brown family and everybody was 
together. 
     
A: We were all -- yes. 
     
Q: Okay. And you didn't talk to Simpson at all that day at the 
recital. 
     
A: No. I said, "You look tired." 
     
Q: And where was he seated when you said that? 
     
A: I just look in the back and I says, you know, "You look tired." 
     
Q: Yeah. That was in the row of chairs there? 
     
A: Yes, yes, when he just walked in. 
 
Q: And you didn't talk to him after that at all? 
     
A: No more. 
     
Q: Did you see who he spoke to, if anybody, during the recital? 
       
A: No. 
     
Q: Your husband was at the recital, wasn't he? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Did you see him speaking to your husband at all? 
     
A: Well, I asked Ron to take pictures you know.  He says, "Why 
don't we all take pictures," stuff like that, so that was --yeah. 
     
Q: That was after the recital. 
 
A: That was during the recital. That was, you know, while we 
were waiting for the program, you know, when Sydney was there 
and [Name Deleted], I said, "Take pictures," so -- 
     
Q: But that wasn't him talking to Simpson at all, was it? 
     
A: No. No. 
     
Q: It had nothing to do with Simpson. 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Okay.  My question to you is: Did you ever see your husband 
talking to Simpson at all either during or after the recital? 
     
A: I didn't see him, no. 
     
Q: Okay.  Did you see Simpson talking to anybody either during 
or after the recital? 
     
A: I saw a few people saying hello, yeah. 
     
Q: Okay. Other than that? 
       
A: No. 
     
Q: Nicole had a camera at the recital, didn't she? 
     
A: I'm sorry.  What? 
     
Q: Did Nicole have a camera at the recital? 
     
A: I don't remember. Yes, I think so.  Or a video.  I'm not sure. 
     
Q: Okay.  She had some sort of camera, though. 
     
A: Yeah, right. 
     
Q: And why did you ask your husband to take a picture of 
Simpson with Sydney? 
     
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. 
     
THE WITNESS: I don't know.  I mean, to me I thought it was 
cute, that they had that nice outfit, you know. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: Okay.  Were you under the impression that Nicole wouldn't be 
taking a picture of Sydney with her father? 
 
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
     
THE WITNESS: No, I was not even thinking about that. No. 
 
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: Let me ask you:  You've said you've had long conversations 
with Simpson since his release from jail, didn't you? 
 
MR. BAKER: Misstates her testimony. 
 
THE WITNESS: Long conversations? 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: Well, conversations with him. 
       
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay. And that's been over at Rockingham? 
     
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay.  Could you tell me the first time you were over there and 
spoke to him after his release? 
 
A: The first time? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
MR. BAKER: I think this has been covered. 
 
MR. KELLY: It hasn't. 
     
THE WITNESS: I -- the first time was I asked where the kids 
were, so I -- Gigi called me -- oh, no.  Actually I called, you know, 
the housekeeper.  I asked if he's here.  And so I said I would like 
to see him.  That was it. 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
 
Q: And -- 
 
A: And so I went there, and that's pretty much -- you know, I 
asked how he was doing, "How are the kids?  Did you see the 
kids?" and that's what we did. 
     
Q: Okay.  Did you talk about the trial at all? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Did you talk about Nicole at all? 
     
A: We talked about Nicole.  I -- you know, I kinda said -- you 
know, we commiserated, you know.  We were both crying. 
     
Q: Did he indicate to you what his plans were now that he was 
out? 
     
A: At that time he said that he's -- "They're investigating.  They're 
gonna look for the real killers." 
     
Q: Who did he say was investigating? 
     
A: He said he's hired investigators, so... 
       
Q: He said he had hired them? 
     
A: Well, he said there are private investigators there and they're 
looking, so... 
     
Q: Did he say these were people that he had hired? 
     
A: I don't know.  I didn't go into specific. 
     
Q: Okay.  But it was your impression that he was actively 
pursuing an investigation -- 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: -- for the real killers?  Have you discussed this again with him 
since that time? 
     
A: No. No. 
     
Q: You've never discussed this investigation again? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Okay. Has he ever indicated to you the status of any 
investigation? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Has he ever indicated to you they have any leads as to who the 
real killers might be? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Has he ever indicated to you he has turned up some evidence 
that indicates he wasn't guilty of these murders? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Have you ever just asked him point-blank whether he was 
innocent of these murders? 
     
A: I never asked him. 
     
Q: After this one conversation you had about investigators and the 
real killers, when was the next time you spoke to him? 
 
A: I guess it was during the time where he was going to have the 
kids.  It was I think around October.  It was Sydney's birthday.  I 
don't know.  Around that time.  And he wanted to know if [Name 
Deleted] would like to go with them.  You know, he said that 
Sydney would like to have [Name Deleted] with her. 
     
Q: Okay. [Name Deleted] did go with her, didn't she? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: And they went to --  
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: -- Neverland? Okay.  How many days was that for? 
     
A: Just all day. 
     
Q: Okay.  Did -- Simpson went with them.  Right? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay.  Did you go with them for that? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: And did you have any discussions with Simpson at that time 
about the murder, real killers or investigation or anything? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Okay.  And when was the next time after that? 
     
A: Next time was when the kids -- when he had the kids again, and 
so he called me where to bring [Name Deleted] at the time, 
because at the time the kids were not at Rockingham. 
     
Q: Okay. And did you bring them somewhere else? 
     
A: Yeah. 
     
Q: Was that [Name Deleted]'s house, do you remember? 
  
A: Yes, Don [Name Deleted]'s house, yes. 
     
Q: Okay.  And did you visit with him for any period of time when 
you took the kids down there? 
     
A: No.  I just dropped [Name Deleted], and then [Name Deleted] 
spent the night there with Sydney, and then I went to -- because at 
the time I wanted to see Sydney.  That's the first time I've seen 
Sydney since, you know, this whole thing, because I said I wanted 
to see the kids, so that was it.  And then the following day I went 
to pick up [Name Deleted]. 
     
Q: Okay. No real conversations --  
 
A: No. 
     
Q: -- at that time? 
     
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Has there been any time since then where you've been 
over at Rockingham and sat down and visited with Mr. Simpson 
for any length of time? 
     
A: That's pretty much what happened. 
     
Q: Okay.  Well, you said you had had some meals over there, too. 
     
A: Meals is when the kids were there right, yes. 
     
Q: Okay.  But sit-down ones with Simpson there, too? 
     
A: Well, one time was the Christmas -- we were exchanging gifts.  
That was Christmas Day.  He invited us, the whole family, to his 
house. 
     
Q: Did you have any discussions with him then or -- 
     
A: About what? 
     
Q: About the murders. 
     
A: No. 
 
Q: About Nicole? 
     
A: Well, we always, you know -- sometimes things like, "This is 
what Nicole would love. This is" -- you know, that's pretty much 
what we -- 
     
Q: Any discussion of any investigation? 
 
A: No. 
     
Q: And the only attorney you have spoken to with Mr. Simpson is 
Mr. Leonard that time? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
MR. KRAMER: Is this in connection with the civil case? That's 
what you're asking about? 
     
MR. KELLY: Yeah. 
     
MR. KRAMER: Okay. 
     
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: Okay. And no other attorneys? 
 
A: No. 
     
Q: Okay.  You never saw Mr. Baker over at Mr. Simpson's house? 
     
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. 
     
(Discussion held off the record.) 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay, I'm done. 
     
MR. KRAMER: Can we take a break for a few moments, please?

Q: Good morning. 
      
A: Good morning. 
      
Q: I have some extra questions for you. The next document I am 
going to show you is Exhibit 165, which is the transcript of your 
interview with Barbara Walters in 1994.  Is everything reflected 
on this transcript attributed to you accurate -- 
     
MR. BAKER: Vague. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: -and true? 
 
A: Pretty much, yes. 
     
Q: It's true to your recollection.  Right? 
     
A: To my recollection, yes. 
     
Q: And if you were under oath at the time of the interview, you 
would have not changed your answers.  Right? 
     
A: Not changed my answers? 
     
Q: Correct. Your answers would have been the same.  You would 
have still told the truth.  Correct? 
       
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay.  Who is Ron Fischman's lawyer at the current time? 
 
MR. BAKER: Irrelevant. 
       
THE WITNESS: I don't know. 
       
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: You have no information at all? 
 
A: No.     
      
Q: Now, you had dinner with Ron Fischman last night.  Right? 
     
A: No, I didn't see him. I talked to him. 
     
Q: You talked to him on the telephone.  Right? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: And the topic of this deposition came up. Correct? 
     
A: He asked how I'm doing -- 
 
Q: And --  
     
A:-and I was crying, and he said, "I'm sorry you have to go 
through that." 
     
Q: And you also talked about his deposition coming up.  Right? 
     
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
     
THE WITNESS: I didn't mention to him about that. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: He brought it up. Right? 
       
A: No. 
     
Q: Didn't come up at all? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Okay.  Did he tell you that he is avoiding service of a subpoena 
on him for this deposition? 
     
A: We didn't talk about that. 
      
Q: Are you aware of that? 
     
A: Of course.  It was in the news. 
     
Q: Are you aware that he is still trying to avoid being served? 
     
A: I don't know about that. 
     
Q: Okay. Has your husband -- has Ron told you that he is afraid to 
testify? 
     
A: He's afraid? 
      
Q: Yes. 
     
A: No, he's not afraid. 
     
Q: Did he tell you that he did not want to testify? 
     
MR.BAKER: I think this is irrelevant. 
     
THE WITNESS: He didn't say that.  He just didn't want to get 
involved. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
He didn't want to get involved even though Nicole is dead? 
     
MR. BAKER: Speculation, argumentative -- 
     
THE WITNESS: Even if Nicole's dead? 
     
MR. BAKER: -- irrelevant. 
     
(Discussion held off the record.) 
     
MR. PETROCELLI: Please go back on the record.  I will start the 
question over. 
     
Q: Ron Fischman has told you that even though this case involves 
a determination of Mr. Simpson's responsibility for the death of 
Nicole, he does not want to get involved? 
       
MR. KRAMER: You are asking if those words or words to those 
effect? 
     
THE WITNESS: Those were not his words.  I just assumed that. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Has he ever talked to you about his willingness to come 
forward and testify in this case? 
     
A: No. 
 
Q: Has he told you about any concerns that he has about testifying 
in this case? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Okay.  Did O.J. Simpson ever tell you before Nicole's death 
that the Los Angeles Police Department was biased against him? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: And that they had treated him unfairly in the past? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: And did Nicole ever tell you that? 
       
A: No. 
     
Q: Anyone ever tell you that? 
       
A: No. 
     
Q: Have you ever been out in public with Mr. Simpson? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Ever? Before Nicole's death. You've   been to events with him. 
Correct? 
     
A: Oh, before Nicole's death? 
       
Q: Yes. 
     
A: Yeah, we -- yes. 
     
Q: Have you ever been out with him and the children, his children 
or your children? 
     
A: His children?  Without Nicole? 
 
Q: No. With Nicole. 
     
A: With Nicole? 
      
Q: With or without Nicole. 
     
A: Probably, yes. 
     
Q: You ever see Mr. Simpson wear a disguise in public to conceal 
his identity? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: And did he ever tell you that he disliked the public notoriety 
and fame that he had? 
     
A: We never talked about it.  
 
Q: Did it appear to you that he enjoyed his notoriety and his fame, 
based on your observations of him? 
     
A: Did he -- if he enjoyed it? 
      
Q: Yes. 
     
A: I don't know. 
     
Q: Did it appear to you that he liked being famous? 
     
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. 
     
THE WITNESS: If he liked being famous? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: I guess so. I don't know. 
     
Q: You don't have an opinion on that?  You knew this man for 
three or four years. 
     
A: Yeah, I don't know. I guess he likes it.  I don't know. 
     
Q: Are you reluctant to say things that you think might hurt him 
in this case? 
 
A: No. 
     
MR. BAKER: Harassing. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: You're here just to tell the truth.  Right? 
     
A: I've been telling the truth. 
     
Q: And if your testimony is truthful, you are not concerned with 
whether or not it will result in damaging evidence against him, are 
you? 
     
A: I'm not concerned about that. 
       
MR. BAKER: Vague. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: You are just going to tell the truth and let the chips fall where 
they may.  Correct? 
     
A: Exactly. 
     
Q: You are not here to protect Mr. Simpson, are you? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: You are not here to protect him because you're concerned 
about his children losing their father, are you? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Have you ever discussed with Mr. Simpson the effect that this 
case might have on his ability to have custody of his children? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: That topic ever come up at all? 
 
A: Talked about the custody? 
       
Q: Yes. 
     
A: Not really, no. 
 
Q: "Not really." What does that mean? 
     
A: Well, we mentioned about -- I asked him when the kids -- when 
he's gonna have the kids. 
     
Q: You mean when is he going to get the kids for good, you 
mean. Right? 
     
A: For good, right. 
 
Q: And what did he say? 
 
A: He said, "Wait till all this lawsuit" --  
 
Q: This lawsuit? 
     
A: -- "is finished."  Yeah.  The whole -- 
     
Q: So you understand that his getting the kids must await the 
outcome of this lawsuit, according to what he told you.  Correct? 
     
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
     
THE WITNESS: No. I thought that they were just finishing the 
school year. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: Well, that's not what you just said.  You just told me that he 
said his getting the kids has to await the termination of this 
lawsuit. 
     
A: He said he's got to take care of a lot of things first. 
     
Q: So it's fair to say that you have an understanding that this 
lawsuit -- the outcome of this lawsuit could have an effect on his 
getting custody of the children.  Correct? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: You have your understanding in that regard? 
     
A: No. 
     
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered.  Harassing. 
     
THE WITNESS: I thought that this -- after the school year ends, 
that he was gonna get the kids. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: What does that have to do with this lawsuit? 
     
A: And that he said he's got to take care of a lot of things first. 
     
Q: You understand that this lawsuit is one of the things that has to 
be taken care of before his custody issue can be resolved.  
Correct., 
     
A: I didn't know that. 
 
Q: He told you that.  Correct? 
     
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
     
THE WITNESS: He told me that he has to take care of things 
first. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: It's very important to you that Mr. Simpson's children be with 
him, isn't it? 
     
A: It is important to me, yes. 
 
Q: Did O.J. Simpson talk to Sydney Simpson at the recital? 
     
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
     
THE WITNESS: O.J. talk to -- 
       
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: Did you see O.J. Simpson talk to Sydney Simpson at the 
recital? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Not at all? 
       
A: No. 
     
Q: Not even during the taking of the photograph? 
     
A: I didn't see them, so... 
     
Q: You did not see Ron Fischman take the photograph? 
     
A: No. 
 
Q: You did not see O.J. Simpson give Sydney the flowers? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: So you saw no interaction at all between Sydney and O.J. 
Simpson? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Okay. Now, before the recital began, the annual performances, 
did you speak to Nicole at all? 
     
A: I don't think so. 
     
Q: And during the intermission did you speak to Nicole at all? 
     
A: During the intermission? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: I don't think there was an intermission. 
     
Q: No intermission at all? 
       
A: No. 
     
Q: Okay. And after the performance did you speak to Nicole? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Okay.  Mr. Simpson, to refresh your recollection, testified that 
there was an intermission. 
     
MR. BAKER: Mischaracterizes his testimony. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: In any event, I believe the evidence will demonstrate that there 
was an intermission. 
     
MR. KRAMER: Does that refresh your recollection? 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: Does that refresh your recollection at all? 
     
A: I don't know.  I don't think there was an intermission. 
     
Q: Now --  
       
A: It was a one-hour thing, so... 
     
Q: Now, the truth is that you and Nicole were upset with each 
other at this time, and that's one of the reasons you did not talk to 
her. Correct? 
     
A: No, I was not upset. 
       
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
       
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
       
Q: But there was a reason why you and she did not speak to one 
another that evening.  Correct? 
     
A: No.  You know what?  That evening was -- it was a lot of 
commotion because we were with the kids and she was with the 
family. 
     
Q: But there were opportunities for you and she to at least 
exchange casual conversation, but you didn't.  Correct?

Q: You attended. Right? 
       
A: No, I didn't attend. 
     
Q: Why not? 
     
A: Well, because Christian came, and there were like four people 
who could get into the opening night, so I told them that "That's 
okay, you know, you guys" -- "you four go," and then I, you 
know...

BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Nothing at all?

Q: Okay. Did Nicole tell you about plans to open up a coffee 
shop? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: She told you about this near the end of her life?

Fischman? 
     
A: Yes.

Q: She asked you for 90,000? 
     
A: Oh, no, no, not that.  Not me. 
     
Q: All three of you would have to come up with 90,000? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: What did she say about 90,000? 
     
A: Well, she said something like 90 000.  Numbers to me were... 
     
Q: That's what Nicole had in the bank, about 90,000. Right? 
     
A: Oh, okay.  Then that's it, then.  That's where I got that number. 
     
Q: Okay. Did she tell you how much money you might be 
expected to contribute? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Did these conversations come up for the first time in the last 
weeks of her life? 
     
A: No. We talked about that before. 
     
Q: When? 
     
A: Even when-before when she just got divorced.  One time she 
said she was -- she wanted to open a hair salon, and one time she 
said she'd like to open where Starbucks used to be, she would like 
to open like a cafe with jazz music there.  You know, she was -- 
she's been thinking about that. 
     
Q: Did the conversations grow more serious near the end?

A: No. 
     
Q: Did she tell you about trips that she took to the emergency

with her gaining weight during pregnancies? 
     
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
     
THE WITNESS: Well, she mentioned about that, yeah. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: What did she say about that? 
     
A: She mentioned about that she didn't like herself being fat. 
     
Q: Yeah, but I am not asking you about that.  I am asking you 
about O.J. Simpson's dissatisfaction with her. 
     
A: No, never mentioned that. 
     
Q: Not once. 
       
A: No. 
     
Q: She mentioned her own dissatisfaction with herself, but not 
O.J. Simpson's.  Is that what you're saying? 
       
A: Yes. 
     
Q: She complained to you that O.J. Simpson did not spend 
enough time with Justin and Sydney?

BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: She did?

A: Yes. 
     
Q: What would she say -- 
 
A: What would she say? 
     
Q: -- about that, yes, when she discussed it with you?

That's pretty much...

not protective -- not overly protective, no. 
     
Q: Was she a good mother? 
 
A: Yes. 
       
Q: Did she love her children? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay. Would she let anything -- she would never let anyone 
harm her children. Correct? 
     
A: Of course, yes. 
     
Q: And she would never let anyone threaten her children's 
security.  Correct? 
     
A: Correct. 
     
Q: And her children were the most important persons in her life. 
Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: You said that O.J. Simpson and Nicole had a passionate 
relationship.   
       
A: Yes. 
     
Q: What do you mean by that? 
     
A: Well, that's what Nicole described their relationship.  They 
used to have passionate -- you know, very sexual and very -- they 
were into each other. 
     
Q: Is it fair to say that when -- that the relationship was passionate 
from both a good and bad standpoint? 
     
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
     
THE WITNESS: I thought when they meant passionate is the 
good side of it, and they had so much passion. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: Well, based on your observations of the relationship, is it fair 
to say that when it was good, it was really good, and when it was 
bad, it was really bad? 
     
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
     
THE WITNESS: I never saw the bad side, so --  because at the 
time I wasn't there when -- I only saw the good side, when they 
were trying to reconcile. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: Well, she told you about being beat up.  Right? 
     
A: No, she never told me that.  She only told me the 1989. 
     
Q: What do you mean, "only"? 
     
A: That was the only incident that -- I thought that was the only 
incident. 
     
Q: You used the word "only."  Does that indicate to you that that 
wasn't so bad because it only happened one time? 
     
A: No, I didn't say that. 
     
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. 
     
THE WITNESS: I didn't say it was -- one time.  I thought at the 
time it was like they had a big fight. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Yeah. 
     
A: That's how I -- because she never talked to me about it. 
 
Q: You knew about the womanizing.  Right? 
     
A: I knew she told me, yes. 
     
Q: So you knew that there were really bad things that had 
happened in her relationship with O.J. Simpson.  Correct? 
     
MR. BAKER: Leading and vague. 
     
THE WITNESS: What do you mean? 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: She had gotten beat up; he had cheated on her consistently; 
he's threatening to put her in jail.  You don't think these are 
attributes of a bad relationship? 
     
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
     
THE WITNESS: I guess.  I don't know.  I guess so. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: Fair to say they had a very stormy relationship? 
     
MR. BAKER: Vague. 
     
THE WITNESS: Stormy? 
       
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: Yes. 
       
A: Yes. 
       
Q: Okay.  Nicole ever tell you that she feared knives? 
     
A: Knives? 
       
Q: Knives. 
     
A: No, she didn't talk about that. 
     
Q: Never told you about her fear of knives? 
     
A: No, never told me. 
     
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. 
       
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: She ever tell you that O.J. had told her that he would kill her 
with a knife? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Have you ever talked to -- Let me ask you this: After --  
     
A: You said four questions. 
     
MR. KRAMER: Yeah, is this -- is this -- are  you halfway through 
your four questions at this point? 
     
MR. PETROCELLI: No, I'm not.  Let me continue.  After -- did 
you ever see Mr. Simpson wield a knife? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: You ever hear Mr. Simpson talk about knives at all? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Did he ever show you any knife collections that he had? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: He gave you knives as a present, didn't he? 
     
A: Not knives. 
     
Q: Did he give you Swiss Army knives? 
     
A: Key chains. 
       
Q: With knives on them.  Right? 
     
A: Yeah, you know, the whole set. 
     
Q: And where did he get them?  Do you know? 
     
A: From the Swiss Army. 
     
Q: Swiss Army what? Company? 
      
A: Company. 
     
Q: And they made all kinds of knives? 
     
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
     
THE WITNESS: Yes. I guess, yes. 
       
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You ever see any other kinds of knives in his house other than 
eating knives? 
     
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay.  Did he tell you about a knife he had purchased in May 
of 1994? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Okay.  You knew he was filming FROGMAN in May of 1994 
in Los Angeles? 
     
A: I thought it was in Puerto Rico. 
     
Q: Did you know that he was filming part of the sequences in Los 
Angeles? 
       
A: I didn't know that. 
     
Q: Did you ever discuss with him that project? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Do you know any of the scenes in that project? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Do you know that he wielded a knife in one of the scenes in 
that project?     
       
A: No, I didn't know that. 
     
Q: Okay.  Did you ever learn that O.J. Simpson told Faye Resnick 
that he would kill Nicole? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: If Faye were to testify to that, do you have any reason to think 
she was lying?  If Faye were to testify that O.J. Simpson called 
her on May 2 or May 3 and said, "I'm going to kill Nicole," do 
you believe that Faye was lying? 
     
A: I wouldn't believe Faye at all. 
      
Q: You would not believe her? 
     
A: Not at all. 
      
Q: You think that's a lie? 
     
A: I think Faye's mouth, I think everything as a lie. 
     
Q: And if Christian confirmed that, would he also be lying, 
     
A: Christian? 
       
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Probably, yes. 
     
Q: And why do you think that both of them would lie about such a 
thing? 
     
MR. BAKER: Vague. Argumentative.  Leading. 
     
THE WITNESS: Both would lie? 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
      
Q: Yes. 
     
A: You mean meaning to kill somebody?  You're gonna tell -- 
     
Q: Threaten to kill Nicole, yes. 
     
MR. BAKER: Mischaracterizes the testimony. 
     
THE WITNESS: I don't know. 
       
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: So you believe that if both Christian and Faye were to say such 
a thing under oath, they would both be liars.  Is that what you're 
saying? 
     
A: Well, with Faye, I wouldn't believe Faye. 
     
Q: I am asking you now about Christian. 
     
A: Christian, I don't know. Probably, yes.  I don't know. 
     
Q: Probably he would be lying also? 
       
A: No. Probably -- 
 
Q: He would be telling the truth? 
       
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay.  You mentioned something about a [Name Deleted] at 
Toscana's.  A waiter at Toscana's? 
       
A: Yes. 
       
Q: Now, this is a man that Nicole met in 1994? 
     
A: No.  Way before that. 
      
Q: Way before that? 
     
A: Uh-huh. 
     
Q: Did Nicole -- 
       
A: We used to -- 
 
Q: I'm sorry.  Go ahead. 
       
A: I'm sorry, yeah. 
     
Q: Did Nicole express any interest in this [Name Deleted] at 
anytime in 1994? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: And how long to your knowledge had Nicole known [Name 
Deleted]? 
     
A: Since I've known Nicole.  No.  I mean since we started going 
to Toscana. 
     
Q: Was [Name Deleted] still a waiter at Toscana in 1994 before 
Nicole's death? 
     
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what interest -- Withdrawn. 
     
A: Had Nicole ever had any sort of relationship -- sexual 
relationship with [Name Deleted] before 1994? 
     
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And what about during 1994? 
 
A: During 1994? 
 
Q: Before she died. 
       
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Well, describe the sexual relationship Nicole had with [Name 
Deleted] in 1994 before she died. 
     
A: That wasn't 1994.  She was still at Gretna Green, so... 
     
Q: When she was having a sexual relationship with [Name 
Deleted], she was living at Gretna Green? 
 
A: What's -- 
    
Q: I am -- 
     
MR. KRAMER: Are you having a problem with the term "sexual 
relationship"? 
     
THE WITNESS: Yeah, I don't -- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Having any kind of sex, intercourse, oral sex. 
 
MR. KRAMER: You are talking physical sex? 
 
THE WITNESS: Messing around?  I don't know.  She always 
says, "I mess around."  So what does that mean? 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: So when she said "mess around" to you,  what did you 
understand it to mean?  Oral sex? 
     
A: I guess. 
     
Q: Okay. Well, let's include messing around as a type of sexual 
activity between two adults.  Are you focusing on what I'm saying 
now? Okay?  So using that in the definition of sexual relationship 
or sexual activity, did Nicole have any sexual activity with [Name 
Deleted] at Toscana? 
     
A: I guess so. 
     
Q: And when -- Did you see it? 
     
A: No. I wasn't there. 
     
Q: Nicole told you about it.  Right? 
    
A: Nicole told me. 
     
Q: Okay.  And when did Nicole tell you? 
     
A: After that.  After the incident.  I don't know.  I mean, during 
one of our runs, so I can't--  
     
Q: Was it during the time that Nicole was involved in her 
reconciliation effort with O.J. Simpson? 
     
A: Oh, boy. I don't know. I don't know.  I'm sorry. 
     
Q: And in 1994 did Nicole have any sexual activity with [Name 
Deleted] at Toscana? 
     
A: I don't know. 
     
Q: Did she tell you about any? 
     
A: She was very attracted to him. 
     
Q: What did she tell you in 1994 before she died about her interest 
in [Name Deleted] at Toscana? 
     
A: Oh, by then they were just friends.  They were just -- 
     
Q: All the time that Nicole was at Bundy they were just friends 
and nothing more.  Is that what you're saying? 
     
A: I assumed, yes. I don't know.  I mean, they still talked to each 
other.  They did talk to each other intermittently, yes. 
     
Q: Did she tell you that she was interested in this [Name Deleted] 
during the time she was living at Bundy? 
     
A: I don't remember. 
     
Q: After Nicole's death and after you found out Ron Goldman also 
had been killed, did you ever talk to any of Ron Goldman's 
friends, such as [Name Deleted] or anyone else, about Ron's 
death? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: And tell me what -- tell me who you spoke to and what was 
said. 
     
A: I spoke to [Name Deleted] and [Name Deleted]. 
     
Q: At the same time? 
     
A: Yeah, pretty much whenever I saw them they were together, 
yes. 
     
Q: And this was soon after the deaths of Ron and Nicole? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Did you call them up? 
     
A: No.  Actually the first time I saw them after that was that 
Tuesday when I went to Bundy, and they were there.  They were 
putting flowers. 
     
Q: [Name Deleted] and [Name Deleted] were laying flowers? 
     
A: Right, laying flowers on the ground. 
     
Q: At Bundy? 
     
A: At Bundy.  And they saw me. 
 
Q: And that's the first time you saw them? 
     
A: Right. 
     
Q: And tell me what you talked about. 
     
A: Well, we just hugged each other and we were crying.  Pretty 
much that was -- 
     
Q: Well, tell me what was said, if anything, about the reasons -- 
well, the facts and circumstances of the deaths. 
     
A: Everybody was confused and shocked at that time that -- you 
know, that was pretty much --  
     
Q: Did they -- did [Name Deleted] or [Name Deleted] say 
anything about O.J. Simpson's involvement in Ron's death and 
Nicole's death? 
     
A: Yes.  Yes. 
     
Q: What did they say to you? 
     
A: You know, they said, "Do you think he did it?" Because that 
was what everybody asked, you know.  Even the media asked me 
-- that was the first question. 
     
Q: Did they tell you what -- about any history between Ron and -- 
Ron Goldman, that is, and O.J. Simpson?

Starbucks?

any confrontations that O.J. Simpson had with Ron Goldman?

THE WITNESS: No. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q Did they give you any information about why Ron was at 
Nicole's condominium that evening? 
     
A: We -- no.  No.  We -- they thought that he was just bringing the 
glasses, so that was pretty much what... 
     
Q: You've talked -- have you talked to anybody about Ron's -- Ron 
Goldman's activities that evening, why he was going to Bundy, 
where he might be going afterwards, anything like that? 
     
A: No. 
       
Q: No? 
     
A: What do you mean, "activities"?  Like what? 
     
Q: His whereabouts, you know, why he was there that evening.  
Have you ever spoken to anybody about that? 
     
A: Yeah. 
     
Q: Who? 
     
A: Why Ron was there? 
      
Q: (Nods head.) 
     
A: I talked to-I don't know.  To my friends and to -- you know, to 
my friend Cici at that time and to all those people I talked to.  You 
know, we questioned how -- why was he there, what was he doing 
there, you know, yeah. 
     
Q: Did you learn anything? 
     
A: Pretty much all the answers were vague at the time. 
     
Q: Okay.  Do you know whether Ron Goldman ever drove 
Nicole's car? 
     
A: If I knew? 
     
Q: Yeah. 
     
A: Yes. 
      
Q: Did he? 
     
A: Well, Nicole told me yes, one time.  That's when they all went 
out. 
     
Q: And she told you that Ron drove the car? 
     
A: Ron -- yeah, Ron drove the car because they were both drunk at 
the time, Faye and Nicole were drunk, and Nicole -- and Ron 
didn't want them to drive the car, so he volunteered.  He 
volunteered to drive them home because he was not drunk? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay.  And nobody ever told you about Ron Goldman being 
involved in drugs.  Correct? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Okay.  Did Nicole tell you that Ron Goldman worked out at a 
place called The Gym in Brentwood? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: What did she tell you about that? 
     
A: That he works out there. Nicole was not interested in working 
out, anyway, so it didn't matter. 
     
Q: Did Nicole work out at The Gym in Brentwood? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: No? 
 
A: (Shakes head.) 
     
Q: Did she work out at any health club? 
     
A: I worked out with her at Pro Gym once, you know.  I had to 
drag her.  But she never liked working out with weights, was not 
interested in that. 
     
Q: Did O.J. Simpson give Nicole very expensive diamond 
earrings for Christmas, the last Christmas that Nicole was alive? 
     
A: You know, I never saw those earrings.  I don't know.  I've 
never seen those. 
     
Q: They were discussed in the Star article -- 
     
A: Yeah. 
     
Q: -- that you were paid to give information for.  Do you know 
about the earrings? 
     
A: She told me she has those earrings.  They were beautiful, yeah. 
     
Q: Do you know whether Nicole returned a pair of earrings to O.J. 
Simpson when she gave him back the bracelet? 
     
A: If I know about it? 
     
Q: Yeah.  Did she tell you about that? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Did she tell you that O.J. Simpson had asked back for the 
earrings when she returned the bracelet? 
     
A: I think what happened was she lost one or she lost the other, 
and she had one made or something. 
     
Q: Did she tell you that she made a claim for insurance and got 
money? 
     
A: I didn't know that. 
     
Q: Okay.  So you don't know anything about her returning these 
earrings to O.J. Simpson-- 
 
A: I didn't know. 
     
Q: -- or giving them to him? 
     
A: I didn't know that. 
     
Q: Okay.  She didn't tell you anything about that. 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Have you ever been to McDonald's with O.J. Simpson? 
     
A: McDonald's?  Probably.  Oh, no, no, no, I don't think so. 
     
Q: The answer is no.  Correct? 
       
A: No. 
     
Q: Have you ever been there with O.J. Simpson to eat? 
     
A: With O.J.? 
       
Q: Yeah. 
       
A: No. 
     
Q: Okay.  Did you see O.J. Simpson and Paula Barbieri together 
at any time in May or June of 1994 before Nicole's death? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When? 
 
A: I was driving down Wilshire and I saw O.J.'s car with a 
woman, and I called Nicole. I said, you know, "I think O.J.'s with 
Paula."  So that was it.  That's my --  
     
Q: And to the best of your recollection, when did that occur? 
     
A: Oh, God, around -- around May, around that time. 
     
Q: Before or after Nicole's illness? 
     
A: Nicole was sick at the time, so that was --  
     
Q: During the time she was ill? 
     
A: Yeah, right, yeah. 
 
Q: And what was Nicole's reaction when you told her that? 
     
A: She didn't say anything.  She didn't express anything.  She was 
just, "Oh," you know. 
     
Q: Did you know that Paula Barbieri ended her relationship with 
O.J. Simpson on the morning of June 12? 
     
A: I didn't know that. 
 
Q: Did you know that O.J. Simpson and Paula Barbieri had a fight 
about whether Paula should attend the dance recital? 
     
A: I didn't know that. 
     
Q: Did Nicole and you ever discuss her feelings towards Paula? 
     
A: Her feelings? 
     
Q: Yes, Nicole's feelings. 
     
A: Well, she was kinda jealous of Paula. 
     
Q: And she related an incident at Marcus Allen's wedding where 
she left the wedding because Paula called? 
     
A: She didn't attend the wedding, yes, because Paula called, yeah, 
right. 
     
Q: So just because Paula called the Rockingham house -- 
     
A: Yeah. 
     
Q: -- Nicole refused to attend the wedding -- 
     
A: Exactly. 
     
Q: And what -- because she was so upset about Paula. 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: And in December of 1993 Nicole got very upset when a 
Christmas basket from Paula arrived at the Rockingham house as 
well.  Correct? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: And Nicole was angry with O.J. Simpson about that. Correct? 
     
A: Yes. Right. 
     
Q: Do you know whether Nicole ever spoke to Paula Barbieri? 
     
A: That was the time when Nicole answered the phone, you know, 
June -- Marcus Allen's wedding.  That was the only time I know. 
     
Q: And Nicole told you about this? 
       
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Were you there? 
       
A: No. 
     
Q: She called you up and told you about it? 
      
A: Yes.  She said that -- 
       
Q: What did she tell you? 
     
A: She said that Paula called, and she answered the phone. 
     
Q: This was at Rockingham? 
     
A: Yeah, right, she was at Rockingham. 
     
Q: And what did Nicole tell you transpired in the telephone call 
with Paula when she picked up the phone? 
     
A: Nothing. She just said that -- 
     
Q: Nothing? 
     
A: Well, she just -- you know, she said, "Paula called, and I 
answered the phone," and that was it. 
     
Q: You mean to tell me Nicole calls you up and says, "Paula 
called while I was at Rockingham.  I answered the phone.  
Nothing else happened, and now I'm not going to the wedding"? 
     
A: Yeah, she was upset. She says, "I don't believe that that 
woman's still" -- "they're still talking to each other." 
     
Q: And she was still upset when she talked to you on the phone 
about this.  Right? 
     
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: What did you say, by the way, when she said that to you? 
     
A: I said, "Well" -- I don't know.  I forgot how I reacted, you 
know. 
     
Q: Well, I would like you to remember now.  Can you remember? 
     
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. 
     
THE WITNESS: She was upset.  She didn't want to attend the 
wedding. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: She told you this over the telephone? 
     
A: Yeah. 
     
Q: Did you try to talk her into going to the wedding? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Did you go? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Now Mr. Kelly asked you earlier today about your 
conversations with Nicole concerning the IRS letter, and you said 
that prior to -- Withdrawn.  You said that the only time -- or the 
first time that you heard about the dispute that she and O.J. 
Simpson were having about the IRS situation occurred when the 
letter arrived, but not before.  Do you recall that testimony? 
     
MR. BAKER: Mischaracterizes her testimony. 
     
THE WITNESS: When the letter arrived? 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: Yeah.  When Nicole got the letter, she called you and told you 
about it? 
     
A: Exactly, yes. 
     
Q: But in fact you knew about it earlier than that. 
     
A: Earlier than that? 
     
Q: Didn't you, because I questioned you about this, and I told you 
that Nicole -- I asked you about Nicole having a very angry 
exchange with O.J. Simpson at the house on Bundy on June 3 and 
that Nicole told you about it after it occurred?  Do you recall that 
testimony that you gave? 
     
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
     
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: Let me show you Exhibit 86. 
     
MR. BAKER: Lacks foundation. 
     
THE WITNESS: Uh-huh, yeah. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: You see Nicole's notes there, and you see the entry on June 3? 
     
A: Uh-huh. 
     
Q: Where O.J. Simpson -- where Nicole writes that O.J. Simpson 
said, "You hung up on me last night, bitch."  Do you see that? 
     
A: Yeah. 
     
Q: Now, it's true that Nicole Simpson told you about this very 
ugly exchange with O.J. Simpson that she had with him on the 
evening of June 3, as you previously -- 
     
A: I didn't know it was the evening.  See -- it was -- this in the 
evening?  Or 8:30? 
     
MR. BAKER: Leading and vague. 
     
THE WITNESS: Well, she called me.  She called me -- I'm trying 
to... Because I remember she called me, and she was upset. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: Tell me what she said to you. 
 
A: She said, "I can't believe this man is trying to put me into jail.  
I'm the mother of, you know, the kids" -- "I'm the mother of his 
kids, and he wants me to go to jail." 
     
Q: Did she tell you about -- 
     
A: The conversation? 
     
Q: Yes. 
     
A: No, no. 
 
Q: So your prior testimony that you gave me is false? 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: What prior testimony? 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: You testified just a day or two ago that she told you about this 
conversation with O.J. Simpson. 
     
MR. BAKER: Argumentative and leading. 
     
THE WITNESS: No.  I -- just the conversation -- I thought you 
mean the conversation, but not all of this, no.  She didn't tell me 
all of this.  She told me that she had a fight with O.J.   
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: She had a fight with O.J. 
     
A: She had an argument with O.J. about this IRS, that she was 
upset about it, that's all, but she didn't tell me all of this in detail. 
     
Q: She didn't repeat the profanity to you that O.J. Simpson used.  
Is that what you're saying? 
     
A: Exactly.  Yes --  
     
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. 
     
THE WITNESS: -- yes. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: And she-when she told you -- Excuse me.  Do you remember 
when she told you about this fight with O.J. Simpson about the 
IRS situation? 
     
A: Did -- I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Could you repeat the question 
again? 
     
Q: Tell me when she told you about this fight with O.J. Simpson 
concerning the IRS situation. 
     
MR. BAKER: Mischaracterizes her testimony.  She didn't refer --  
     
THE WITNESS: She must have told me -- 
     
MR. BAKER: -- to it as an argument. 
 
THE WITNESS: -- that same day. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Okay.  Because she was still upset about it.  Correct? 
     
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. 
     
A: Because it was during the day, so I don't know what time. 
     
Q: Now, did she tell you that she hung up on O.J. Simpson -- 
     
A: She hung up? 
     
Q: -- on June 2 or June 3 or thereabouts? 
 
A: No, I didn't know that.  I didn't know that. 
     
Q: Did she ever tell you what O.J. Simpson's reaction was when 
she hung up on him on telephone conversations? 
     
A: No, I didn't know that. 
     
Q: Okay.  Nicole writes in this diary entry here or whatever this 
document was intended to be that O.J. told her as follows on June 
3: 
     
"You hung [sic] up on me last night.  You're gonna pay for this, 
bitch, you're holding money from the IRS, you're going to jail you 
f-----g c--t.  You think that you can do any freaking thing you 
want, you've got it coming -- I've already talked to my lawyers 
about this, bitch -- and they'll get you for tax evasion bitch I'll see 
to it.  You're not gonna have a f-----g dime left bitch." 
 
Okay?  Now, do you know of any reason why Nicole would ever 
make up such a thing' 
     
MR. BAKER: Speculation. 
     
THE WITNESS: No, she --  
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: So if she wrote this down and said in her own handwriting that 
O.J. Simpson said these things to her, do you believe that they are 
true? 
     
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
     
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: Excuse me? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Does that shock you, that O.J. Simpson would say those things 
to her? 
     
MR. BAKER: Argumentative and irrelevant. 
     
THE WITNESS: I'm shocked now because of what I -- 
       
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: You've never seen this before? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: You mean Mr. Simpson didn't show this to you during your 
talks at Rockingham? 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: He didn't show this to you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: He didn't say, "Look, Cora, look what I said to Nicole"?

A: [Name Deleted] is one of the kids from [Name Deleted]. 
     
Q: And is that a friend of Sydney?

Q: So when Nicole wrote here about [Name Deleted] that she was 
Sydney's girlfriend in the same paragraph about the rest of this 
material, and that was true also, that [Name Deleted] is a person 
who is a friend of Sydney.  Correct?

Q: Where does [Name Deleted] live? 
     
A: Somewheres -- I don't know. 
     
Q: What is [Name Deleted]'s last name?

Deleted], so... 
 
Q: What is [Name Deleted]'s mother's name? 
       
A: I don't know.  I don't know.  I only know [Name Deleted].  I've 
seen her once or twice, so...

A: [Name Deleted]? 
     
Q: Yes. 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: [Name Deleted] is also a friend of Sydney? 
 
A: Sydney, yes. 
 
Q: And what is the name of [Name Deleted]'s mother?

Q: Have you ever talked to the Berman family about their 
conversations with Nicole on the evening of June 12th? 
     
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever talked to [Name Deleted]'s family about this 
event on June --  
     
A: No. 
     
Q: -- 3 or 4? 
      
A: No. 
     
Q: Okay.  Did your child sleep over Nicole's house any time in the 
month of June of 1994? 
     
A: Any time? 
     
Q: Yes.  At Bundy.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: Do you recognize that handwriting to be Nicole's?

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

to tell you?

BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: You can answer. 
     
A: I don't know why, and I question why. 
     
Q: You think she might have been too ashamed to tell you about 
these things? 
     
MR. BAKER: Speculation.

Q: Okay.  Did O.J. -- excuse me.  Did you know that O.J. Simpson 
had lost a child in his prior marriage? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Who told you that? 
     
A: It was in the news. 
     
Q: Did you ever talk to O.J. Simpson about that? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Did Nicole ever tell you about that? 
     
A: Yes, Nicole mentioned that. 
     
Q: Okay.  Did she say that O.J. Simpson blamed her for that? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Did Nicole ever tell you about an incident where O.J. Simpson, 
and I am reading from her notes here, "smashed my car (white 
Mercedes) with baseball bat after visiting [Name Deleted]"? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: "He greeted me at the gate -- I was too afraid to get out of the 
car.  He did it because I was late, about 7 to [sic] 8 p.m.  Westec 
Security was notified and came.  Also the West LAPD came."  Do 
you know anything about that? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Do you know who [Name Deleted] is? 
     
A: [Name Deleted]? 
     
Q: Yes. 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: And who is [Name Deleted]? 
     
A: She was a friend of Nicole. 
     
Q: Is [Name Deleted] related to [Name Deleted]? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Is that the wife of [Name Deleted]? 
       
A: No. The daughter. 
 
Q: The daughter of [Name Deleted]? 
       
A: Uh-huh. 
     
Q: That's a friend of Nicole's? 
       
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay.  She never told you about that incident? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: The next item on Exhibit 88, from which I'm reading, says: 
     
"Michael Millitello's wedding at Ritz Carlton.  O.J. lost his temper 
at the beach house -- hit me, threw me up against the walls.  Threw 
my camera, it broke the paneling -- the moldings off the doors to 
the master bedroom and garage door."  Did she ever tell you about 
that incident? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Do you know who Michael Millitello is? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Name mean anything to you., 
       
A: No. 
       
Q: What about Eric and Val Von Watts?  That name -- 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: -- mean anything to you?  Nicole wrote to her lawyer, Bruce 
Clemens, in sending these materials over to him: 
 
"The [sic] dates are almost impossible for me to remember.  These 
are the most memorable times -- there were plenty of small times 
where he'd just pushed me or grabbed me hard enough to bruise 
my arms but they happened so often that I can't remember 
specifics --  Nicole."  Did you ever see O.J. Simpson push Nicole 
or grab her? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Of course, you never saw -- Withdrawn.  Did you learn of any 
dispute or argument between Ron Fischman and Nicole about 
your going out with [Name Deleted]? 
       
A: Do I know? 
       
Q: Yeah.  This is not the incident on June 11 -- 
       
A: No. 
     
Q: -- but prior in time. 
       
A: No. 
     
Q: When Ron and Nicole had an argument, and then Nicole called 
O.J. Simpson up and asked O.J. Simpson to speak to Ron? 
     
A: I didn't know that. 
     
Q: You knew nothing about that? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Okay.  You were not at the Jenners' Christmas party in 1993 -- 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: -- correct?  Did you tell O.J. Simpson that when the prosecutors 
interviewed you in this case, they tried to slant your testimony or 
make you lie?  Did you tell that to O.J. Simpson that the 
prosecutors -- 
     
A: They didn't make me lie, but they trying to accuse me of 
saying, "How could you be Nicole's friend if you don't know 
anything about the abuse?"  I said, "But, you know, I never saw 
it." 
     
Q: You never saw it.  Right? 
     
A: Yeah. 
     
Q: That doesn't mean it didn't happen.  Right? 
     
MR. BAKER: Leading and argumentative. 
     
THE WITNESS: I never saw -- I thought it didn't happen, so -- 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: Now that I have shown you those notes of Nicole's, you don't 
have any reason to believe that Nicole made all that up, do you? 
     
A: I don't think so. 
     
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
      
Q: You don't think so, do you? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Did you ask O.J. Simpson to have some footballs signed in 
1994 and that he refused to do so for you?  Do you recall that 
incident? 
     
A: Well, it was sitting there, and then he just -- I thought he just, 
you know, he didn't sign it. 
     
Q: You asked him to have the footballs signed for you. 
     
A: Well, no, I didn't -- what happened was, I had Gigi -- said, "If 
he has time, could you please sign these."  These were not, you 
know --  these were from a friend of mine. 
     
Q: And he was upset with you, and he didn't sign them initially.  
Correct? 
     
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
     
THE WITNESS: So at the time I didn't know he was upset with 
me.  
 
MR.PETROCELLI: Okay.  Hold on.  We need to change tapes 
real fast.  We are almost finished. 
     
THEVIDEOGRAPHER: This is the end of tape No. 1 of Volume 
III.  The time is approximately 12:44, and we are off the record. 
     
(Brief recess.) 
     
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are on the record.  The time is 
approximately 12:47.  This is the beginning of tape No. 2 of 
Volume III. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: Now, before the tape change I was asking you about an 
incident where you had requested O.J. Simpson to sign footballs, 
and you learned that he would not do so because he was upset 
with you.  Could you relate that incident to us and tell us when it 
occurred? 
     
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
     
THE WITNESS: I just found out later on when Nicole told me 
that O.J. was upset with me, but I thought he was just busy 
because he was out of town, and I had left that -- you know, I told 
Gigi to have him sign those. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: Why did Nicole -- Excuse me.  Did Nicole tell you why O.J. 
was upset with you? 
     
A: At that time I thought that because of my affair. 
     
Q: Do you know why Mr. Simpson would be upset with you 
about your affair, particularly since he had a history of infidelity 
on his own part? 
     
MR. BAKER: Speculation. Argumentative. 
     
THE WITNESS: Because he thought that the reason why Nicole 
was going out -- he thought that we were always going out, Nicole 
and I. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: He was -- in other words, you got the feeling that O.J. Simpson 
was blaming you for Nicole's independence from him and her 
going out. 
     
A: Exactly. 
     
MR. BAKER: Leading. 
     
THE WITNESS: All of the, you know -- 
       
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: All the going out. 
     
A: Right. 
     
Q: And you feel -- and you got the sense that O.J. Simpson was 
blaming you in part for the problems he was having in his 
relationship with Nicole.  Correct? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
MR. BAKER: Speculation.  Leading. 
      
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: Correct? 
       
A: Yes. 
     
Q: And that's what Nicole told you.  Correct? 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: Okay.  Do you believe you did play a part in O.J. Simpson's 
problems with Nicole during this time? 
     
A: No, I don't think so. 
     
Q: So you think O.J. Simpson was off base, then? 
     
MR. BAKER: Vague. 
     
THE WITNESS: Yes, I think so. 
       
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: Now, you were spending substantial amounts of time with 
[Name Deleted]--  
       
A: That's --  
     
Q: -- throughout May and June of 1994.  Correct? 
     
MR. BAKER: Irrelevant --  
     
THE WITNESS: What do you -- 
     
MR. BAKER: -- vague. 
     
THE WITNESS: -- mean "substantial"? 
     
(Discussion held off the record.) 
(Pending question read.) 
     
MR. BAKER: Okay.  Irrelevant and vague. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
       
Q: You may answer. 
     
A: May and June, you said? 
       
Q: Yes. 
     
A: Not substantial amount.  What do you mean, "substantial 
amount"? 
     
Q: Several times a week.  Three or four days a week. 
     
A: Yes. 
     
Q: You were not home very often.  Correct? 
     
A: I was home most of the time, yes. 
       
Q: Didn't O.J. Simpson blow up with you in a telephone call when 
you were pressing him to sign the footballs? 
     
MR. BAKER: Vague and leading. 
 
THE WITNESS: Blow up? 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: Yeah.  Didn't he have a conversation with you in which he was 
upset with you and told you so when you had asked him about the 
footballs? 
     
A: I never asked about the footballs. 
     
Q: Did you have a conversation with him in May or June of 1994 
in which he was upset with you? 
     
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered.  Leading. 
     
THE WITNESS: I don't remember. 
       
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: You don't remember any conversations with him in which he 
was upset with you. 
     
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. 
       
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: Is that what you're saying? 
     
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered.  Leading. 
     
THE WITNESS: I don't remember, because -- no, I don't 
remember, no. 
       
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: By the way, that incident that Mr. Kelly asked you about this 
morning concerning Tryst, when you left the restaurant, was there 
anyone else there in your party? 
       
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. 
     
THE WITNESS: Was there anyone else there? 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: In your party's still there at the table, right. 
 
A: We all left at the same time. 
 
Q: So the answer is no? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Is that what you're saying? 
       
A: Yes. 
     
Q: It's true that you bolted out of there, you were so upset.  
Correct? 
     
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered.  Argumentative. 
     
THE WITNESS: Who was upset? 
       
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You were. 
     
A: I was not upset. 
     
Q: At O.J. Simpson's reaction and his behavior. 
     
MR. BAKER: Argumentative --  
     
THE WITNESS: I was not upset. 
     
MR. BAKER: -- asked and answered. 
     
THE WITNESS: We had a good time then. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: Do you remember an incident at Los Brisas or Las Brisas 
where you were with Faye Resnick, Nicole, Cici and Ron 
Fischman and O.J. Simpson and Christian Reichardt in which the 
Simpsons started going on a tirade against smoking?  Do you 
remember that? 
     
MR. BAKER: Argumentative. Vague.  Leading. 
     
THE WITNESS: What's "tirade" mean?  It's like angry and stuff? 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Yes, angry --  
     
A: No, it was not-it was a conversation.  I wouldn't say an angry 
conversation, no. 
     
Q: But he was protesting the smoking by the women.  Right? 
     
A: Yeah. 
     
Q: Okay.  And he got so loud that the women got up and walked 
out of the restaurant.  True? 
     
MR. BAKER: Leading -- 
      
THE WITNESS: No -- 
     
MR. BAKER: -- argumentative. 
 
THE WITNESS: -- that's not true. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: Did you get up to leave because he was speaking so loudly? 
     
Q: No.  We got up because -- no.  They got up first.  Faye and 
Nicole got up first and -- to have -- to smoke, and that was it, and 
then I followed them. 
     
Q: So while Simpson is ranting and raving about smoking, Nicole 
and Faye get up to go out and have a cigarette. 
     
MR. BAKER: Argumentative -- 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
       
Q: Is that right? 
     
MR. BAKER: Argumentative -- 
       
THE WITNESS: No -- 
     
MR. KRAMER: Let him finish his objection. 
 
MR. BAKER: Argumentative.  Vague.  Leading. 
     
You can answer. 
     
THE WITNESS: It wasn't that way, no.  It wasn't that ranting and 
raving.  We were just -- we were talking, you know.  There was no 
argument then. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Not at all. 
       
A: No. 
     
Q: It was a friendly, pleasant, affable discussion.  Is that --  
     
A: No -- 
 
Q: -- what you're saying? 
     
A: -- I wouldn't say friendly.  It was like we were debating the 
pros and con of smoking. 
     
Q: What was Simpson's point of view in that debate? 
     
A: That he doesn't like -- he's a non-smoker. 
     
Q: He didn't like Nicole smoking.  True? 
     
A: He didn't like Nicole smoking, yeah. 
     
Q: He would never buy her a cigarette lighter, would he? 
     
MR. BAKER: Speculation. Argumentative. 
     
THE WITNESS: (No audible response.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: Did you ever see him --  
     
MR. KELLY: Was there an answer -- I'm sorry.  Was there an 
answer to that? 
     
MR. PETROCELLI: I'm waiting for the answer. 
     
THE WITNESS: Oh, I didn't know I thought you were just -- 
    
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: He wouldn't buy her -- based on what you observed and knew 
of Mr. Simpson's position about Nicole's smoking, you don't think 
he would buy her a cigarette lighter, do you? 
     
MR. BAKER: Same objections. 
     
THE WITNESS: Yes, I guess so. 
     
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
     
Q: You guess what? 
     
A: Why would someone buy someone -- I don't know.  I mean, 
why would -- if you're a non-smoker --  
     
Q: Exactly.  That wouldn't make sense to you.  Correct? 
     
A: Correct. 
     
Q: You ever see a gold Cartier cigarette lighter that Nicole got in 
the last months of her life? 
     
A: I never saw that.  I didn't see it. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

Q: Was he closer to the street or closer to the condominium? 
     
A: Closer to the -- well, closer to the gate.  Because he was hosing 
like this (Indicating) to the --  
     
Q: He was by the gate hosing towards the front street.  Would that 
be fair to say?

A: Right. 
     
Q: Okay.  Right as you get to the corner of the condominium. 
     
A: Right. 
     
Q: Okay.  And when you came -- and you didn't go back along the 
side way, to the side of the condominium, did you at all? 
     
A: I don't remember.  All I knew is I walked inside the house, so -- 
inside the condo. 
     
Q: Okay.  Did you look down that sidewalk? 
     
A: No. 
     
Q: Towards the rear?

MR. BAKER: Vague. 
     
BY MR. KELLY: 
     
Q: Okay. And you don't even recall looking at the back gate, do 
you? 
 
A: If I don't recall? 
     
Q: Do you recall even looking at the back gate? 
     
A: No, I don't think so.

Q: Okay.  You never saw them cleaning anywhere but in that 
front gate area, did you? 
     
A: I never saw them?  No, I never saw them. 
     
Q: Okay.  And one other thing:  When you called Ron Hardy, you 
called him because isn't it a fact that he had told the producer, 
Barbara Walters, that you were not a real friend of Nicole's and 
that the Brown family didn't support you? 
     
A: Well, the Browns wanted me to talk to Barbara Walters.  I 
didn't want to talk to Barbara Walters. 
     
Q: Right. 
     
A: But then what they told me was, "You cannot talk about the 
lesbian affair."  I said, "You're putting me" -- "if they're gonna ask 
me questions, all I can say is tell the truth. I cannot deny anything. 
     
Q: Well, you didn't know about the lesbian affair from yourself, 
did you? 
     
A: From myself? 
 
Q: I mean, you didn't have personal knowledge of that. 
     
A: I don't have personal knowledge --  
     
Q: Okay. 
     
A: -- but both of them told me. 
       
Q: Go on.  I'm sorry. 
     
A: That's all. 
     
Q: Did you say anything to Ron Hardy to the effect of, "You don't 
know who you're messing with, and you're gonna be sorry for 
telling those people that"? 
     
A: No, I didn't say that. I said, "How could you do that?" you 
know.  "I mean, who are you?"  I mean, you know, I was upset 
with him, yes.  I was upset with him. 
     
Q: Okay. But do you recall saying, "You don't know who you're 
messing with, and you're gonna be sorry for saying that"? 
     
A: No, I never said that. 
     
MR. KELLY: Okay. I have no further questions. 
     
MR. BAKER: The entire walkway was wet when you were there 
on June 14th? 
     
THE WITNESS: Yes.  They were all cleaning, yes. 
     
MR. PETROCELLI: Objection.  Leading.  Move to strike the 
answer. 
     
MR. BAKER: No further questions. 
     
MR. PETROCELLI: The witness keeps answering before I can 
object.  Can we have a stipulation to relieve the court reporter of 
his duties.  The original transcript will be sent to Mr. Kramer on 
behalf of the witness.  The witness will have 30 days from your 
receipt, Mr. Kramer, within which to review and sign the 
manuscript, and if it is not returned to us within 30 days after your 
receipt, then all parties stipulate that the manuscript can be used 
for all purposes in this case as though it had been signed, and it 
may be signed under penalty of perjury? 
 
MR. KRAMER: That's fine.  If the witness -- and there wasn't the 
standard admonition.  If the witness deems it appropriate to make 
changes, those changes will be made to the original, and I will 
return the original to you, Mr. Petrocelli. 
     
And I am not assuming an obligation to advise other counsel of 
the changes unless they are all going to be listed on the 
manuscript.  I don't know all the counsel involved.  So, Mr. 
Petrocelli -- 
     
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, send those to me.  But let me caution 
the witness that if, you know, you make any changes in that 
deposition transcript, we can comment on those, and those 
comments may be used to impeach you.  Okay? 
     
MR. BAKER: You going to give her admonitions after three 
days? 
     
MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah. 
     
THE WITNESS: What does "impeach" mean? You mean I go to 
jail? 
       
MR. PETROCELLI: Don't know about that.  Thank you very 
much, Miss Fischman. 
     
MR. BAKER: Thank you.
